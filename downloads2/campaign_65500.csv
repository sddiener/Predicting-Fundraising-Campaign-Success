Live Better.  </h1><p>Sleep. It's just as important to our health and well being as exercise and nutrition. We spend 30% of our lives in bed and failure to get regular uninterrupted sleep has been medically linked to heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, loss of libido, depression and impaired cognitive function. Taking over the world, or just walking around with a smile on your face, forget about all of it if your body isn't properly recharged.</p><div data-id=""22145514""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1538076205/jov1q8nv4wzrim8hu4mx.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>BedJet has taken a technological leap past sleep sensors that simply monitor and educate on your prior night's sleep.  BedJet was the first product to use muscular bed climate control to hack into your body's own natural pre-programmed circadian biorhythm's to fundamentally alter what your body THINKS it should be doing while you are in bed.  </p><p>These sleep science biohacks are the result of ground breaking sleep temperature research sponsored by the National Institute of Health and the Dutch Institute for Neuroscience. The key is that your body's core temperature changes over the night.  Simply put, it's all about being the right temperature AND at the right time of night.    </p><p>Remember waking up in the middle night to kick the covers off because you were too hot, falling back asleep and then waking up later too cold? That's interrupted sleep and a reset to your deep sleep REM clock. It's also your body not being allowed to achieve the right body core temperature for deep sleep and your brain making a manual adjustment.</p><p>BedJet 3 incorporates these medical studies into our biorhythm temperature technology.  Taking into account your sex, age and body type, BedJet will create a custom sleep temperature profile tailored just for you:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/S7UQmh7aEHU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Hour by hour, the BedJet will make continuous climate control adjustments in your bed designed to help you get to sleep faster, stay asleep longer and wake up feeling more refreshed.  Sensors will take into account any unusual changes in ambient bedroom temperature over the night and make adjustments accordingly.  </span></p><p>Every person is different and because of this the BedJet can adapt the temperature profiles over time to your preferences. You will also be able to create manual temperature profiles from scratch, to activate different warming or cooling settings over your own customized time scale and recall them with a simple 1-touch memory button.</p><div data-id=""22145625""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1538076206/pnyw6smd7ri8yzzdqpc5.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h1>What Doctors &amp; Professional Athletes Are Saying</h1><p> </p><div data-id=""22165655""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1538076207/hb49p9v0pihryh5drdvn.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>From talking to our customers and reading their reviews, we always knew the BedJet helps people sleep better and more comfortably, especially folks who tend to sleep hot, sweat a lot in bed or have any type of thermoregulation problem. </p><p>We decided to put BedJet to the test with medical Doctors (if you believe those kind of people).  Dr. Jordan Stern, a founding member of the Sleep Technology Council of the National Sleep Foundation just completed a clinical study of the BedJet in 2018 with a demographic of the worst night sweat, overheating and bed time hot flash folks we could find: menopausal women.  </p><p>The results were overwhelmingly positive and the BedJet clinical trial study has been accepted for publication in a peer reviewed and prestigious major medical journal this October 2018.  </p><p><b>For the folks who participated in our trial (and we love those Sweaty Betty's!), we are happy to announce BedJet is now clinically proven to:</b></p><ul>
<li><b>Improve sleep</b></li>
<li><b>Help you get to sleep faster, stay asleep longer and wake up less frequently during the night</b></li>
<li><b>Relieve symptoms of hot flahes</b></li>
<li>
<b>Improve feelings of tiredness and lack of energy </b> </li>
</ul><p>We believe BedJet is the <b>first hardware device ever</b> to be able to make all of these medical claims.  If you are a Sweaty Betty or sleep next to one, BedJet is definitely for you!  </p><p>But it isn't just women benefiting from BedJet.  Did we mention the New York Jets purchased fleets of BedJets directly from us for their star athletes?  These huge muscled up dude's super high metabolisms make them burn super hot at night when trying to sleep.  The New York Jets have purchased BedJets directly from our company three years in a row now to issue to their best athletes at their summer training camp hotels.</p><p>We can't claim any endorsement here (we seriously don't have the kind of bucks for that) -- only the factual repeat and return sale of our equipment directly to the team three years in a row now!         </p><div data-id=""22164995""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1538076208/w5xzkz0bufhskvyazgaw.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h1> End the Daily Alarm Clock Tragedy </h1><p> An alarm clock wakes you up by annoying you.

It is the first and only product that can both cool you off within 10 seconds and heat the bedding of a king size bed to feel like the sheets just came out of dryer in only 180 seconds. </p><p>How does the air based cooling and heating work? </p><p>Getting too hot in bed never feels good. Body heat and moisture get trapped by your mattress and bedding like an oven. Typical air temperatures surrounding your body under the bedding reach over 90 degrees. Over the course of the night we have measured up to a 20% increase in humidity in the bed from natural body perspiration.  BedJet was the first company's to publicly identify humidity trapped under sheets as one of the primary causes for feeling to hot.  </p><p>The BedJet convective and evaporative method of cooling is incredibly effective.  Cooling mode power ventilates your bed by circulating fresh ambient temperature air into your bed to quickly wick out this trapped body heat and body moisture.  You select variable amounts of air flow from the BedJet to get different levels of cooling. Wonder how good it really feels? Check out the <a href=""http://a.co/22odNSJ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reviews here on how well the cooling works from our original BedJet v1/v2 owners here.</a> </p><p><b> Please Note: BedJet is NOT a substitute for zero air conditioning in extreme ambient heat (79 degrees+) bedrooms. BedJet is not a portable air conditioner. Room temp needs to be below 79 degrees for best cooling.</b>  </p><p>The heating mode lets you choose variable output temperature and variable air flow to help customize what feels just right for you. Turbo-Heat mode gives you a 5-minute burst of extra powerful warming (1500 watts!) to get a cold chilly bed nice and toasty in just minutes. BedJet can raise the temperature of your bedding 30 degrees in 180 seconds! </p><p> There's no electric blanket and no heated mattress pad in the world that can do that -- they take up to 40 minutes to warm your bed just 20 degrees plus don't provide even heating.

In 2014 you supported my vision to make the world’s first ultra-rapid climate control system for a bed. The crowdfunding community and our early adopters believed in us before anyone else even knew we existed. You blew us away with your support and your feedback helped shape what BedJet is today - the #1 brand in America for cooling heating and climate comfort bed systems.  We are winning in every category of performance, power, features, customer reviews and market share.  </p><p>It's been a crazy roller-coaster journey along the way for our tiny little start-up.  It turns out the mattress and bedding industry is kind of a hostile place for innovative little start-up folks like us.  </p><p>In our first year, some of the big corporate mattress guys (like just two out of the three largest!) didn't like seeing our success and sent threatening letters from their deep pocketed teams of corporate lawyers to bully us.  </p><p>Last year we had the biggest ""bed-in-a-box"" mattress brand (funded by big corporate venture capital) secretly buy a massive order of 20 BedJet products on Amazon, shipped direct to their engineering R&amp;D center in San Francisco.   Reverse engineering? Who knows.  </p><p>We even had our first ""knock-off"" crowdfunding campaign, where a company took some of our concepts and marketing imagery wholesale and launched without even demonstrating a physically believable working prototype.  As of today, they still have yet to deliver to their backers (we don't think that approach is very smart).   </p><p>All of this <b>still made us smile</b>, because we knew none of it would be happening if we weren't making waves and doing something right with BedJet.  We also knew we had something on our side none of them had -- you folks! Our backers and supporters.  </p><p>During the uncertain and worrisome early days where our company was fighting for a right to exist and I was deathly worried about financial ruin (having invested my life savings in the business), you've always been there for us.  With deep and humble appreciation, I will never forget that and love every one of you for your help.  You helped make my lifelong dreams of being an inventor and successful entrepreneur come true. </p><p>We are still a a small but rapidly growing start-up company.   We are back to our crowdfunding roots for the simple reason that we love being part of the community here.  We just want to design cool stuff that people enjoy and we love you being a part of the journey with us.  Because at the end of each day, success in your next one is all about getting great sleep and waking up feeling good with a smile on your face.</p><p>all the best, </p><p>- Mark Aramli</p><p>CHIEF BEDJETTER</p><div data-id=""22160844""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1538076236/v2fxroynbcogpgk1cqvw.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h1>Rewards</h1><div data-id=""22142670""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div><div data-id=""22142678""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Will cool or heat the entire bed using your own sheets."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1538076237/h7ykurja26xjlfiqut4y.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p>Will cool or heat the entire bed using your own sheets.</p>

The award winning BedJet is the world's first ultra-rapid cooling, heating and climate control system made just for your Bed. It's silky quiet and uses just air.   BedJet's patented biorhythm temperature technology enables programmable temperature control for every hour of the night to help you get to sleep faster and stay asleep longer.  BedJet 3 obsoletes your noisy alarm clock by hacking into your body's natural biorhythm wake triggers, to wake you up gently and incredibly refreshed. BedJet 3 will come upgraded with WiFi connectivity for Alexa voice control and other smart home integrations, an incredible new color screen remote control and a beautiful new iOS/Android App.BedJet air-based cooling is no more stuffy summer nights waking up too hot in bed. The powerful cooling is awesome therapeutic relief for hot sleepers, night sweats and hot flashes. BedJet cooling helps you cuddle longer and never get out of bed to change the house thermostat.   BedJet air-based warming is not your grandmother's electric mattress pad.  It's a personal toasty warm sauna right in your own bed, on-demand in just 60 seconds. The instant and powerful warming forever ends cold feet, cold legs and bundling up with layers of pajamas to get into chilly winter beds.The BedJet dual zone setup (optional) you can keep half the bed cooled while the other half is warmed, ending the night time battle over the thermostat with your partner.    All this while saving you money on your utility bills! Why heat or cool the whole house at night when all that matters is the temperature between the sheets?   We're so deeply grateful to all our prior backers and BedJet owners for enabling the success of BedJet.  In the 3.5 years since we've shipped BedJet v1 to our very first Kickstarters, we rocketed to become:   
The No. 1 customer ranked product of any kind for staying cool in bed on all of Amazon 
 The No. 1 customer ranked product for powered cooling and heating of a bed on all of Amazon 
The No. 1 ranked product of any kind in the entire mattress category on all of Amazon (for products with > 500 reviews) 
One of the most successful sleep technology products ever launched out of Kickstarter into commercial production!
Reading the above still makes our engineering team giddy after all this time! Take a minute and read some of the phenomenal life changing customer reviews here.Actual prototype, not a CAD model Now BedJet is returning home to where it all began to bring you the BedJet 3, upgraded to become our best BedJet ever!  With BedJet 3, you don't just get a remote control for your bed, but one for your body as well.  Sleep Better. Live Better.  Sleep. It's just as important to our health and well being as exercise and nutrition. We spend 30% of our lives in bed and failure to get regular uninterrupted sleep has been medically linked to heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, loss of libido, depression and impaired cognitive function. Taking over the world, or just walking around with a smile on your face, forget about all of it if your body isn't properly recharged. BedJet has taken a technological leap past sleep sensors that simply monitor and educate on your prior night's sleep.  BedJet was the first product to use muscular bed climate control to hack into your body's own natural pre-programmed circadian biorhythm's to fundamentally alter what your body THINKS it should be doing while you are in bed.  These sleep science biohacks are the result of ground breaking sleep temperature research sponsored by the National Institute of Health and the Dutch Institute for Neuroscience. The key is that your body's core temperature changes over the night.  Simply put, it's all about being the right temperature AND at the right time of night.    Remember waking up in the middle night to kick the covers off because you were too hot, falling back asleep and then waking up later too cold? That's interrupted sleep and a reset to your deep sleep REM clock. It's also your body not being allowed to achieve the right body core temperature for deep sleep and your brain making a manual adjustment.BedJet 3 incorporates these medical studies into our biorhythm temperature technology.  Taking into account your sex, age and body type, BedJet will create a custom sleep temperature profile tailored just for you: Hour by hour, the BedJet will make continuous climate control adjustments in your bed designed to help you get to sleep faster, stay asleep longer and wake up feeling more refreshed.  Sensors will take into account any unusual changes in ambient bedroom temperature over the night and make adjustments accordingly.  Every person is different and because of this the BedJet can adapt the temperature profiles over time to your preferences. You will also be able to create manual temperature profiles from scratch, to activate different warming or cooling settings over your own customized time scale and recall them with a simple 1-touch memory button.What Doctors & Professional Athletes Are Saying  From talking to our customers and reading their reviews, we always knew the BedJet helps people sleep better and more comfortably, especially folks who tend to sleep hot, sweat a lot in bed or have any type of thermoregulation problem. We decided to put BedJet to the test with medical Doctors (if you believe those kind of people).  Dr. Jordan Stern, a founding member of the Sleep Technology Council of the National Sleep Foundation just completed a clinical study of the BedJet in 2018 with a demographic of the worst night sweat, overheating and bed time hot flash folks we could find: menopausal women.  The results were overwhelmingly positive and the BedJet clinical trial study has been accepted for publication in a peer reviewed and prestigious major medical journal this October 2018.  For the folks who participated in our trial (and we love those Sweaty Betty's!), we are happy to announce BedJet is now clinically proven to:
Improve sleep
Help you get to sleep faster, stay asleep longer and wake up less frequently during the night
Relieve symptoms of hot flahes

Improve feelings of tiredness and lack of energy  
We believe BedJet is the first hardware device ever to be able to make all of these medical claims.  If you are a Sweaty Betty or sleep next to one, BedJet is definitely for you!  But it isn't just women benefiting from BedJet.  Did we mention the New York Jets purchased fleets of BedJets directly from us for their star athletes?  These huge muscled up dude's super high metabolisms make them burn super hot at night when trying to sleep.  The New York Jets have purchased BedJets directly from our company three years in a row now to issue to their best athletes at their summer training camp hotels.We can't claim any endorsement here (we seriously don't have the kind of bucks for that) -- only the factual repeat and return sale of our equipment directly to the team three years in a row now!          End the Daily Alarm Clock Tragedy  An alarm clock wakes you up by annoying you. BedJet 3 allows you to program a natural bio-hack wake up time. The wake up feature subtly alters your body's core temperature in the morning at the time of your choosing. Just like bright sunlight filling a bedroom, this will activate a pre-programmed circadian reaction in your brain resetting your internal clock to know it's time to start the day. Remember that feeling you had as a kid when you just opened your eyes in the morning full of energy, refreshed and ready to leap out of bed? Yeah, it's like that. BedJet 3 is no more noisy alarm clocks, no more hitting the snooze button four times or dragging yourself out of bed wishing you had just one more hour to linger.Climate Control Technology  BedJet invented the entire product category of ultra-fast on-demand air based bed climate control.  We were also the first company to introduce a top-of-bed dual zone climate controlled sheet to keep half the bed warm and the other half cooled. BedJet 3 works on any size bed and any type mattress.  It gives you the ultimate control over your personal sleep environment - feel how you want, when you want and nearly instantly. The BedJet lives under your bed or tucked neatly out of the way at the foot of your bed.   Installation of the BedJet 3 onto your bed is incredibly simple and done in minutes with no tools. It's under 6"" tall, so it fits under the majority of beds with space underneath so you'll barely know it's there.    Want to use BedJet with your own sheets? Once activated, the patented and acoustically dampened blower, ducting system and outlet nozzle operate at a very specific air pressure to create a scientifically magical event in your bedding. The BedJet quietly generates a small cushion of turbulent air between the upper and lower bedsheets that lifts the top bedding off the bed by a small amount. This tenting effect on the bedding combined with the turbulent air flow enables the air to permeate throughout the entire sleeping area and provide even heating or cooling. Wonder how good that really feels? Check out the awesome customer reviews of our original BedJet v1 and v2 here.     
Your own bedding is used to capture and circulate the air. Or pair the BedJet with our optional Cloud Sheet for the very best air distribution and comfort.  Take a look at the below infra-red camera footage to show just how quickly the BedJet 3 cools you, compared to an industry typical ""cooling mattress"" (which we think in most cases are really just big slabs of foam). 

  Dual Zone Climate ComfortTired of fighting with your partner over the bedroom thermostat? In 2014, BedJet became the first company to introduce a top-of-bed dual zone climate comfort system using a sheet component.  We got the patent on that!     
Dual Zone BedJet bundle with Cloud Sheet setup, your comforter or blanket will go over the top. BedJets can go under the bed or at foot of the bed.Watch on the infra-red camera how quickly each partner gets their own perfect sleep temperature on their own side of the bed with BedJet 3.  We are saving marriages! AirComfort Cloud SheetWant the very best BedJet cooling and experience?  Pair the BedJet 3 with our (optional) AirComfort Cloud Sheet.  The patented Cloud Sheet is a performance engineered, luxuriously soft, 100% cotton temperature layer with specially designed interior air flow cavities.  The BedJet Air Nozzle plugs into the Cloud sheet air flow cavities, gently distributing warming or cooling air through the sheet and down into the bed. BedJet air hose plugs right into the Cloud Sheet The Cloud Sheet replaces your normal bedding top sheet and works underneath blankets, quilts, or regular comforters. Unlike electric blankets, the Cloud Sheet is just pure, soft cotton and like any top sheet, can be washed over and over again. The Cloud Sheet enables the most even distribution of BedJet air in the bed and significantly improves cooling performance of the BedJet. It has the feel and quality of 5-star hotel grade bed linens. The engineered Cloud sheet is the most complex product ever manufactured in the entire sheet industry, with multiple weaves of cotton, differing areas of air permeability, unique stitching and special interior baffling for air flow zones.  With a BedJet powered on, the Cloud Sheet looks wonderfully puffy, soft and down filled. But it’s actually only filled with the conditioned air from the BedJet, making it one of the softest, lightest and coziest sheets ever made! With the BedJet air off, the Cloud Sheet deflates to look just like a high quality top sheet.CLOUD SHEET GUIDE - SINGLE ZONE VS. DUAL ZONE  Our Cloud Sheet variations cover different types of sleep needs for individuals and couples:  Single Zone Cloud Sheet: Works with just one BedJet. It will cool or heat the entire bed to the same temperature (or area under the Cloud Sheet if a Twin XL is used on a King for example). Go with this if you sleep alone, or if you are a couple who enjoys the same sleep temperature needs.Dual Zone Cloud Sheet: The interior flow cavities are split into two halves, one for each side of the bed and each half accepting its own BedJet air supply. Dual Zone Cloud Sheet - check out the air flow separation in the middle between the air flow zones.Dual Zone Cloud Sheet with one BedJet unit: You can cool or heat just your half of the bed without affecting the other side. The side without the BedJet installed will remain un-puffed and look just like a normal top sheet! Get this setup if you are a couple and just one of you needs cooling/heating.  Dual Zone Cloud Sheet with two BedJets:  This setup is our Dual Zone BedJet bundle.  You get independent temperature control to each side of the bed. Each person gets their own remote control and half the bed can be crisply cooled while the other half is tropical warm! New BedJet 3 FeaturesIf there was one thing our BedJetters told us we needed to improve on with the original generation BedJet, it was the very basic remote control that required use of the App for more sophisticated BedJet features.  We took this to heart and got bent on creating the greatest remote control ever made for a bedding and sleep technology product.  We realize we probably went a little overboard, but heck, we're a bunch of super-nerds, we can't help but over-react to critique on our design work!                                    Functional remote control prototype, not a CAD model This special upgraded remote was planned to be part of a future higher end BedJet 3s model, but we are including it in this Indiegogo campaign as an extra perk.  It has a full color screen and backlit keys.  A separate remote control without the color screen is also being developed for legacy BedJet owners and prior Kickstarter backers who want to hold onto their v2 machines a bit longer.   Bluetooth App remote control?  Got that too.  BedJet 3 will come with an improved smart device App built from the ground up with a fresh new UI/UX.  We know the original BedJet App UI/UX needed a big make-over and we're happily making the new App backwards compatible for all BedJet v1/v2 users: Alexa & Smart Home Integrations Our plan on first product release is Amazon Alexa as well as IFTTT control integration.  We will continue to look at other smart home platform integrations after release.  BedJet has user update-able firmware, so the great news is your machine will never become obsolete!   Cooling & Heating for Beds BedJet is the most muscular climate control product ever created for a bed. It is the first and only product that can both cool you off within 10 seconds and heat the bedding of a king size bed to feel like the sheets just came out of dryer in only 180 seconds. How does the air based cooling and heating work? Getting too hot in bed never feels good. Body heat and moisture get trapped by your mattress and bedding like an oven. Typical air temperatures surrounding your body under the bedding reach over 90 degrees. Over the course of the night we have measured up to a 20% increase in humidity in the bed from natural body perspiration.  BedJet was the first company's to publicly identify humidity trapped under sheets as one of the primary causes for feeling to hot.  The BedJet convective and evaporative method of cooling is incredibly effective.  Cooling mode power ventilates your bed by circulating fresh ambient temperature air into your bed to quickly wick out this trapped body heat and body moisture.  You select variable amounts of air flow from the BedJet to get different levels of cooling. Wonder how good it really feels? Check out the reviews here on how well the cooling works from our original BedJet v1/v2 owners here.  Please Note: BedJet is NOT a substitute for zero air conditioning in extreme ambient heat (79 degrees+) bedrooms. BedJet is not a portable air conditioner. Room temp needs to be below 79 degrees for best cooling.  The heating mode lets you choose variable output temperature and variable air flow to help customize what feels just right for you. Turbo-Heat mode gives you a 5-minute burst of extra powerful warming (1500 watts!) to get a cold chilly bed nice and toasty in just minutes. BedJet can raise the temperature of your bedding 30 degrees in 180 seconds!  There's no electric blanket and no heated mattress pad in the world that can do that -- they take up to 40 minutes to warm your bed just 20 degrees plus don't provide even heating. BedJet warming is safer, because it keeps electricity out of the bed where it belongs. Take a look below at the infra-red image of an electric blanket in actual operation in a bed vs. BedJet. Apart from uneven heating, those electric wires are laying right up against your body!   Got heavy night sweats that soak the sheets? BedJet 3 has a special temperature neutral sweat drying mode which ventilates the bed, pulling all the moisture off your body but without freezing you or overheating you. We created this unique feature for one our customers who suffered from a medical condition. Our Engineering Journey

What's that you spied on the backside of the BedJet 3?  Did someone say EXPANSION PORT! We will be releasing an API to qualified developers who want to tinker with their BedJets by adding sensors or other external device innovations.  Who knows, maybe your cool idea might make it into production with us? Project & Timeline  The engineering scope of the BedJet 3 is quite large.  Nearly every single component from our prior generation machine got design upgrades.  The great news is we've already been working on the BedJet 3 for 21+ months now and are nearly complete with the development of the hardware.  We are just now transitioning into manufacturing and developing the more sophisticated software for smart home integrations and the App.    Timeline & History: 
 December 2016 - BedJet founder Mark Aramli says to his chief electrical engineer Peter, ""Hey dude, lets start tinkering on BedJet 3!""

December 2017 - First new electronic prototype designs are tested and characterized

February 2018 - First alpha ""Frankenstein"" BedJet 3 in a representative enclosure design is cobbled together 

June 2018 - Injection mold tooling started 

September 2018 - First 30 BedJet 3 units for field beta testing using injection mold parts are be built.  Underwriters Laboratories safe electric appliance certification is started. 

November 2018 - Firmware frozen, Alexa integration is functional 

December 2018 - Manufacturing started, shipping starts, new App released 
Why We Are CrowdfundingLetter From Mark Aramli, BedJet InventorThis is where it all started. In 2014 you supported my vision to make the world’s first ultra-rapid climate control system for a bed. The crowdfunding community and our early adopters believed in us before anyone else even knew we existed. You blew us away with your support and your feedback helped shape what BedJet is today - the #1 brand in America for cooling heating and climate comfort bed systems.  We are winning in every category of performance, power, features, customer reviews and market share.  It's been a crazy roller-coaster journey along the way for our tiny little start-up.  It turns out the mattress and bedding industry is kind of a hostile place for innovative little start-up folks like us.  In our first year, some of the big corporate mattress guys (like just two out of the three largest!) didn't like seeing our success and sent threatening letters from their deep pocketed teams of corporate lawyers to bully us.  Last year we had the biggest ""bed-in-a-box"" mattress brand (funded by big corporate venture capital) secretly buy a massive order of 20 BedJet products on Amazon, shipped direct to their engineering R&D center in San Francisco.   Reverse engineering? Who knows.  We even had our first ""knock-off"" crowdfunding campaign, where a company took some of our concepts and marketing imagery wholesale and launched without even demonstrating a physically believable working prototype.  As of today, they still have yet to deliver to their backers (we don't think that approach is very smart).   All of this still made us smile, because we knew none of it would be happening if we weren't making waves and doing something right with BedJet.  We also knew we had something on our side none of them had -- you folks! Our backers and supporters.  During the uncertain and worrisome early days where our company was fighting for a right to exist and I was deathly worried about financial ruin (having invested my life savings in the business), you've always been there for us.  With deep and humble appreciation, I will never forget that and love every one of you for your help.  You helped make my lifelong dreams of being an inventor and successful entrepreneur come true. We are still a a small but rapidly growing start-up company.   We are back to our crowdfunding roots for the simple reason that we love being part of the community here.  We just want to design cool stuff that people enjoy and we love you being a part of the journey with us.  Because at the end of each day, success in your next one is all about getting great sleep and waking up feeling good with a smile on your face.all the best, - Mark AramliCHIEF BEDJETTERRewards Will cool or heat the entire bed using your own sheets.

<h3>The Affordable Smart Colour Light</h3>
<p>'Not another smart LED light' you'll hear the tech reviewers say.</p>
<p>We were really attracted to the idea of changing the decor to suit your mood or set a mood. Being able to dim your lights, set any colour schemes, automate them to come on or off and operate remotely, all at the swipe of an app, with no expensive wiring or controls we believe is something everyone should enjoy.</p>
<p>Ours is an attractive, good quality metal bodied light perfect for exposed fittings and we really rate our app for ease of use, especially the less tech savvy. Not having deep marketing pockets we plan to cut through using low margins and very competitive prices on our quality lights.</p>
<p>Please have a look and see how easy it is to play in this space. Help us be price competition in this space and get more people into colour changing lights sooner at prices many more people can afford.</p>

<div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">At these launch prices our lights cost much less for full colour and white choice globes. Mood lighting used to be very expensive but now most people can enjoy it in their home. We like our classic globe shape. Best of all you can still use your wall switches if you like, as our lights start up exactly as they were when the power was switched off. Many lose their colour and dimmer settings when they lose power. We have designed our App for all people - a couple more navigation steps than others but really obvious and easy to use as a result.</span></div>
<blockquote>I use my phone as a 'hot spot' for internet in my apartment. Can I still use your lights? </blockquote>
<p>You do need WiFi to connect your device to the bridge and then to change the light settings, so the simple answer is no. If you have a WiFi router even not connected to the internet you can use that (i.e. without a plan or sim card or phone line). You can switch our lights normally too on the existing circuits but they always work only at the last settings made when connected.</p>
<p>You need internet to control your lights from outside of your home WiFi network.</p>
<blockquote>Do your lights work outside?</blockquote>
<p>Our LEDs produce virtually no UV light so don't attract bugs. They cannot be used in exposed positions and need to be protected from weather just like other normal light globes. Under verandahs, eaves etc is fine. You can easily dim them so not to bug the neighbours too.</p>
<blockquote>Can I use them in enclosed fittings?</blockquote>
<p>LEDs do not produce any heat from the light source but they do at the solid state junction. All LED lights have a heat sink design to dissipate this heat. Opposite to normal lights the light bit doesn't get hot but the body can. At just 7W ours don't produce a massive amount of heat, especially on colour or dimmed, but to be safe we do not recommend small enclosed fittings, just as most LED lights don't. </p>
<blockquote>Can I use them with existing dimmer switches?</blockquote>
<p>No, only if these are turned to full power. You can them dim then on the App.</p>
<blockquote>Can I use my existing light switches?</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely, to switch them on and off at the last settings made. Many of our competitors lose their settings when the power is lost - they are designed to work only on their App, or their wall switches. This can be annoying especially if set low in a bedside lamp or similar and you forget to use the app. Switching off at the wall does save a very small amount of standby power, though you probably wouldn't notice.<span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<blockquote>Why do you have a bridge and some models don't?</blockquote>
<p>This design keeps the costs lower as each light only needs to communicate with the bridge, and not the devices, reducing overlapping components in each globe. The bridge is small and can be placed out of sight and uses minimal standby power.</p>
<blockquote>How far away from the bridge will a light work?</blockquote>
<p>Approximately 30M which should cover the largest homes. Some construction types may reduce this slightly. An extra bridge can be used if required to overcome this. Each bridge can handle up to 50 lights.</p>
<blockquote>Are the colours as bright as the white lights? (i.e. nearly 600 Lm)</blockquote>
<p>No, the colours are less and vary on the colour chosen. Typically for mood and accent lighting you want these subdued anyway. When photographed the colours appear fuller too but you will find the colour performance very satisfactory, especially in multi globe fittings.</p>
<blockquote>What are Lumens?</blockquote>
<p>Lumens are a measure of the amount of light produced, and the best way to compare all light technologies. All incandescent lights are similarly bright, according to the wattage (power used). LEDs are very energy efficient so Watts are a poor indicator now of brightness for LEDs and CFL (compact fluorescents). </p>
<blockquote>Can I use multiple devices / instances of Apps to operate your lights?</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and easily so. Our App has a secure sharing method so once one device is set up you can share those settings and groupings across to other devices. You can also set your childrens apps on their iPods or tablets up so only their lights are entered, so they can't be mischievous with yours or their sibling's lights.</p>
<blockquote>Can expect to control Philips Hue lamps or others with yours?</blockquote>

</div></div>","The Affordable Smart Colour Light
'Not another smart LED light' you'll hear the tech reviewers say.
We were really attracted to the idea of changing the decor to suit your mood or set a mood. Being able to dim your lights, set any colour schemes, automate them to come on or off and operate remotely, all at the swipe of an app, with no expensive wiring or controls we believe is something everyone should enjoy.
Ours is an attractive, good quality metal bodied light perfect for exposed fittings and we really rate our app for ease of use, especially the less tech savvy. Not having deep marketing pockets we plan to cut through using low margins and very competitive prices on our quality lights.
Please have a look and see how easy it is to play in this space. Help us be price competition in this space and get more people into colour changing lights sooner at prices many more people can afford.
Save even more with our REWARDS referrals to earn FREE lights for yourself!



Quick and Easy Set-Up - No Extra Wiring Required



Replace your globes with ours, download the app, connect the bridge and you're ready to go. Our lights can still be switched at the wall without losing their settings.

     You need WiFi in your home and a smart device to work our lights.

Choose Any Colour
'You connect' to your mood and choose a colour to match how you feel. You can go from vivid to muted and everything in between in a matter of seconds without leaving your lounge. Find your favourite colour in the RGB spectrum from the more than one million colours available. Game time you can select your team colours.









Set Your Brightness
You can change the light from white to any colour, from dimmed to bright - all done from the app on your device. 
(If you already have dimmer switches they'll need to be set to full)




Plus Five White Tones to Choose From


You can select from cool and bright when you need to see detail, to warm and relaxing when you don't. You can't buy the wrong white with our lights.




Timers & Remote Control
Easily create timer events to turn your lights on and off automatically and control them from your armchair, or even from the other side of the world.  
We let 'you connect' with greater security and convenience.


Kids Love Them (and they're practical too!)
They can have bright cool light for reading or homework, plus 'awesome' colours anytime they want. Our security design means you can easily set them up to access their lights only. 





Power Saving and Long Life LED Technology
We have a two year replacement warranty on our durable lights. With a 25,000 hour LED life rating and a robust construction they will change the way you think about light globes forever.





Needing just 7W of power for nearly 600 Lumens of brightness, these are smart and efficient LEDs.

21st Century Technology in the Classic Globe Shape
We like our classic globe shape with its 21st century technology - it will look far better than most in exposed light fittings and it's long life perfectly suits hard to get to light fittings. Smart LED Lights don't have to look like robots.







Australian Company with a Global Light


We are an Aussie start up and the standard fitting for us is the Bayonet Cap (and we spell color 'colour'). We also have the ES26 Edison Screw, which fits both E26 and E27 sockets and is the main fitting our factory in China supplies. Our lights work on 110-240V inline voltage and 50-60 Hz - if your local power is in this range you can have our lights.

 We can supply these E14 to E26 adaptors - add $4 each . 






Intuitive, Easy to Use App
We want our lights affordable for most people, not just the early tech adopters, so we have made sure our App navigation is very obvious and easy to master. Below is a sample of the screens, and at our website you can test drive our emulator.


If you are not sure what colour you are feeling we have our Every Colour feature, where the light cycles through over 100 samples across the spectrum - you make it Upbeat, Relaxed or anywhere in between.  Get the party started or slow it down - you choose how 'you connect' with your home.   



Risks & Challenges
 As of June 1st we have now had to confront a second unexpected delay after two problems we did not anticipate.  We are having some communication difficulties with our manufacturing partner in China but nothing we cannot overcome, just not quickly enough nor with confidence of timeline for us.
Accordingly we have offered all Perk supporters a full refund with a commitment to re-contact them when we have our campaign back on track. We will update this campaign when we have full confidence in timelines.
We unreservedly apologise to our supporters and thank them for their support and well wishes. 






Technical Specs


We will supply the appropriate power supply for your region.
Frequently Asked Questions

Why is your funding goal so low?
We have already made the investment in tooling and design, and production samples and full testing, so this project is proceeding anyway. We are inviting people to support us and join our production order at these low prices.
What is different about your lights to others available?
At these launch prices our lights cost much less for full colour and white choice globes. Mood lighting used to be very expensive but now most people can enjoy it in their home. We like our classic globe shape. Best of all you can still use your wall switches if you like, as our lights start up exactly as they were when the power was switched off. Many lose their colour and dimmer settings when they lose power. We have designed our App for all people - a couple more navigation steps than others but really obvious and easy to use as a result.
I use my phone as a 'hot spot' for internet in my apartment. Can I still use your lights? 
You do need WiFi to connect your device to the bridge and then to change the light settings, so the simple answer is no. If you have a WiFi router even not connected to the internet you can use that (i.e. without a plan or sim card or phone line). You can switch our lights normally too on the existing circuits but they always work only at the last settings made when connected.
You need internet to control your lights from outside of your home WiFi network.
Do your lights work outside?
Our LEDs produce virtually no UV light so don't attract bugs. They cannot be used in exposed positions and need to be protected from weather just like other normal light globes. Under verandahs, eaves etc is fine. You can easily dim them so not to bug the neighbours too.
Can I use them in enclosed fittings?
LEDs do not produce any heat from the light source but they do at the solid state junction. All LED lights have a heat sink design to dissipate this heat. Opposite to normal lights the light bit doesn't get hot but the body can. At just 7W ours don't produce a massive amount of heat, especially on colour or dimmed, but to be safe we do not recommend small enclosed fittings, just as most LED lights don't. 
Can I use them with existing dimmer switches?
No, only if these are turned to full power. You can them dim then on the App.
Can I use my existing light switches?
Absolutely, to switch them on and off at the last settings made. Many of our competitors lose their settings when the power is lost - they are designed to work only on their App, or their wall switches. This can be annoying especially if set low in a bedside lamp or similar and you forget to use the app. Switching off at the wall does save a very small amount of standby power, though you probably wouldn't notice. 
Why do you have a bridge and some models don't?
This design keeps the costs lower as each light only needs to communicate with the bridge, and not the devices, reducing overlapping components in each globe. The bridge is small and can be placed out of sight and uses minimal standby power.
How far away from the bridge will a light work?
Approximately 30M which should cover the largest homes. Some construction types may reduce this slightly. An extra bridge can be used if required to overcome this. Each bridge can handle up to 50 lights.
Are the colours as bright as the white lights? (i.e. nearly 600 Lm)
No, the colours are less and vary on the colour chosen. Typically for mood and accent lighting you want these subdued anyway. When photographed the colours appear fuller too but you will find the colour performance very satisfactory, especially in multi globe fittings.
What are Lumens?
Lumens are a measure of the amount of light produced, and the best way to compare all light technologies. All incandescent lights are similarly bright, according to the wattage (power used). LEDs are very energy efficient so Watts are a poor indicator now of brightness for LEDs and CFL (compact fluorescents). 
Can I use multiple devices / instances of Apps to operate your lights?
Yes, and easily so. Our App has a secure sharing method so once one device is set up you can share those settings and groupings across to other devices. You can also set your childrens apps on their iPods or tablets up so only their lights are entered, so they can't be mischievous with yours or their sibling's lights.
Can expect to control Philips Hue lamps or others with yours?
Not at the moment but a future App upgrade could have their sdk integrated. We have considered this and first want to expand the market for RGB globes. If we end up with a large overlap we would have to seriously consider it.
Can we expect any sort of IFTTT integration? (this would be a major plus!)
This will require a firmware upgrade to our bridge and something in our sights. Our first priority is to give a good light experience and we are watching development in this space with interest.
Do your lights have progressive start up to full brightness on timer events?
No. We looked at this function and tested it, and did not see any real effect on our eyes from an instant start up or a gradual 1 second brightening. On just a 600 Lumen light we don't see much comparison with the sun starting the day - and it is nothing like camera flash going off.
How long will your lights last?
They are long life globes and we provide a two year full replacement warranty. The LEDs are rated to 25,000 hours. LEDs are not affected by constant switching and will last  much, much longer than incandescent or fluorescent lights. They are very durable.
Do your lights work on all devices?
Most current devices - you need to have IOS 6+ or Android3 or later.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>*$1,000 for a new lens</p>
<p>Your contributions will get you unique nature spirit photos that I have captured!</p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal, the money will be saved until I can afford to buy the lens :)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My goal is to travel to different places to help people become aware of the beauty that is all around them.  I would like to contribute photos to places like the National Audubon Society and National Geographic so people can see things they don't normaly get the chance to see.  Ultimately, I would like to help protect our wildlife and natural habitats around the world.</p>

<p>I am Jimmy DeToto. Owner of DeToto Photo. We try to provide things as inexpensively as we can especially when involving children and animals. Too many times i've done the photography at a party that had a moonbounce and seen them ask to get one for their party... just to be told they cant afford it because they are EXPENSIVE to rent from most places. I'd like to help remedy that if i can. All of the contributors to this project will help with this project to be able to get everything set to be able to rent this out to all of the kids. Hoping to do $50 for the first day and $35 for additional days. And depending on the week/month we're having as a company i'd be able to give it out for free at times too with everyones help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>What we need is about $2300. About $1700 goes to getting the moonbounce here and then the rest to store it for the year. Everything else will go for maintaining, transporting and getting everything set to be able to rent out. If we do not reach our goal, We will put what we have received into the savings and we will put whatever we can towards the goal to be able to get this done as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I am always trying to help out... to make people happier and to provide them with things not normally available because of price. I do this personally and withing my businesses as well. Morals and goodwill to help anyway possible. So this would help alot and because of our prices being so low as well as living expenses, i havent been able to fully get this project set in motion, so i decided to see who was willing to help out. </p>

<p>Thank you for considering this fundraiser. We are all very excited to get this going and will post pictures of all of the happy kids and events! Please share this if you can. Very much appreciated!</p>

</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">There's
always risks that can delay the process before metal mirror gets into your
hands. We thought it might be good to share some of them so you know what we
are dealing with.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Manufacturing
process: One of the biggest challenges is the manufacturing process. Quality
control will be at the top of the list and most important issue. There are many
reasons why the artisans cooperation will not be easy. We understand that
Indiegogo backers want their product as soon as possible, but we are limited by
capabilities for mass production by real people.The process is very time
consuming and the technology is indigenous. Often artisans make 2 to 3 pieces
of the mirror to get perfection in reflection and finish, Hence the process is
expensive and time consuming.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Enhancements
in production: When in production there are a couple of parameters that can be
improved during the process such as the color, reflection, weight, final
finishing, Making such enhancements during the process will be in order to improve
your experience with metal mirror. We will do everything we can to ensure that
mirror ships with superior quality.</p>
<p>Shipping
and customs: When we start shipping there's always a risk of the product
getting stuck in customs, either when we are receiving the products from
artisans or shipping them to you. We have prepared as well as we can and
hopefully there won't be any delays.</p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 40px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">                                                                                FAQ</span><br/></p><div><br/></div><div>

There's
always risks that can delay the process before metal mirror gets into your
hands. We thought it might be good to share some of them so you know what we
are dealing with.
Manufacturing
process: One of the biggest challenges is the manufacturing process. Quality
control will be at the top of the list and most important issue. There are many
reasons why the artisans cooperation will not be easy. We understand that
Indiegogo backers want their product as soon as possible, but we are limited by
capabilities for mass production by real people.The process is very time
consuming and the technology is indigenous. Often artisans make 2 to 3 pieces
of the mirror to get perfection in reflection and finish, Hence the process is
expensive and time consuming.
Enhancements
in production: When in production there are a couple of parameters that can be
improved during the process such as the color, reflection, weight, final
finishing, Making such enhancements during the process will be in order to improve
your experience with metal mirror. We will do everything we can to ensure that
mirror ships with superior quality.
Shipping
and customs: When we start shipping there's always a risk of the product
getting stuck in customs, either when we are receiving the products from
artisans or shipping them to you. We have prepared as well as we can and
hopefully there won't be any delays.                                                                                FAQ
I forgot to add shipping to my Perk
and contributed 20 USD - have I now paid for shipping?
If
you have already purchased Metal Mirror Perk, but did not contribute the 20 USD
extra needed for shipping at the same time, we recommend you to buy the
Shipping Perk separately. 
However,
if you did not buy the Shipping Perk separately, but made an additional
contribution of 20 USD, we will match this contribution with your metal mirror
and you don't need to buy the Shipping Perk. This counts as the shipping cost.

I
did not choose a Perk when contributing, but I paid the whole sum for the
Mirror - do I get a Mirror anyway? 
If you made
a contribution for the mirror, but forgot to add a mirror Perk, please contact us
at,  care <at> masterpiecestores
<dot> com.

Will
you keep me updated with the progress if I contribute? 
Yes! When
you contribute to the metal mirror campaign we will ensure that you receive all
the latest information about the mirror project as it progresses.

Are
shipping costs included in the Perk price?
No,
the price is excluding delivery. Please add 20 USD for shipping after you have
selected your Perk. For example, if you have selected the Mirror Perk for 199
USD, increase the sum to 219 USD. However you do not have to pay shipping cost
for purchases of mirrors with price over 500 USD.
Does
the Perk price include VAT or other taxes?
No,
contributors must pay any taxes and duties related to the selected destination
country. Tax, customs fees and other applicable customs charges are not
included in the price of the mirror. Once we get close to
the delivery date, we will ask you to confirm your shipping address and we will
provide further instructions on handling VAT or any other applicable taxes.
I had problems making a
contribution, please help?
If you faced problems when making a
contribution, please check common contribution errors.
I
made a contribution, but now I've changed my mind. Can I have my money back?
Contributions
on Indiegogo are nonrefundable according to the Indiegogo Terms of
Use. A contribution is a transaction that takes place purely between the
contributor, campaign owner and payment processor. Masterpiecestores.com does
not refund any contributions made. However, if you are not happy with the
product we deliver, you may return the mirror within 14 days of receiving it.
Read more from the Indiegogo Help Center.
I
am not happy with the Mirror, can I return it?
You
may return the mirror delivered to you within 14 days of receiving it. Please
note that return shipping, including any customs or other charges as applicable,
will be borne by the sender. Keep in mind that we only accept returns from
ship-to countries supported by the metal mirror Indiegogo campaign. 
To
request a return please submit a ticket to care <at> masterpiecestores
<dot> com.  Please indicate clearly
in the subject and body of the message “RETURN”, providing any relevant
information including contribution number, contribution date and payment method
utilized. Please return the product in good condition.
When will you ship the Mirror? 
Assuming the Indiegogo campaign reaches
its goal, we aim to ship the first mirrors in 4th week of May 2015.
Please note that the delivery date is subject to change. In any event, we will
keep you updated on the schedule in our update emails. 
Will
the metal mirror be available in my country?
The
campaign is applicable worldwide, however, if we cannot ship our products due
to any unforeseen reasons we will let you know and refund your money. 

If
I take part in the Indiegogo campaign, will I get the metal mirror before
others? 
You will be
among the first ones to get the metal mirror. We'll ship the mirrors in the
order of contributions made through Indiegogo.

Will the Mirror be available also for
general sale or only through Indiegogo? 
If
there is demand, we'll consider all options. In any case, the Indiegogo
contributors will get the mirrors first and with the lowest price at the time
of delivery.
After
contributing to the campaign, what happens next? Do you just deliver the mirror
to me?
We
will keep you updated frequently on the progress of the mirror project by e-mail.
Once we get close to the delivery date, we will ask you to confirm your
shipping address and we will provide further instructions on handling VAT or
any other applicable taxes.

<p><strong>What is the Drumi? </strong> </p>
<p>The Drumi is a foot-powered washing machine that requires minimal amounts of water and no electricity. It is compact and easy to maneuver. </p>
<p><strong>What is the maximum loading capacity per cycle?</strong></p>
<p>Each cycle can hold up to 5 pounds of clothing. This measures up to approximately 5 - 7 personal items (t-shirts, undergarments, etc). We do not recommend towels or bed sheets as they are a bit too heavy.</p>
<p><strong>What types of clothing can I wash in the Drumi?</strong></p>
<p>Anything from undergarments to pet clothes, baby clothes, and ordinary t-shirts.</p>
<p><strong>How long does it take for a cycle with the Drumi?</strong></p>
<p>It takes approximately 5 - 10 minutes for a wash: approximately 3 minutes for a wash, 2 minutes for a rinse and 1 minute for a spin.</p>
<p><strong>How much water does the Drumi use per load?</strong></p>
<p>Approximately 5L - 10L of water is required for a wash and an additional 5L - 10L for rinse. The lid of the Drumi can be used as a way to measure and add water; it can hold 5L at once. </p>
<p><b>How do I get rid of the water?</b></p>
<p>There is a twist valve located in the back of the Drumi that will release the water.</p>
<p><b>Where does the water go?</b></p>
<p>The water is released through the back. The Drumi will include a detachable hose that allows you to channel where the water is released to.</p>
<p><b>How wet are the clothes when I'm done a cycle?</b></p>
<p>The Drumi spins the clothes, leaving them a little bit damp. They can then be hung to dry.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to find a nearby power supply? </strong></p>
<p>No, this product does not require any energy consumption and is powered entirely by a foot pedal.</p>
<p><strong>What is the cost per load?</strong></p>
<p>The Drumi is very cost-effective. There is no additional cost for energy and the Drumi actually saves the user money. This is because it reduces the use of a standard washing machine. </p>
<p><b>What type of detergents can I use?</b></p>
<p>Liquid, powder detergent or any type of detergent alternatives you may use. If the user chooses an eco-friendly detergent, they will have an entirely renewable laundry  experience.</p>
<p><strong>What are Soap Nuts?</strong></p>
<p>Soap Nuts are a natural laundry detergent alternative. There are a natural surfactant that separates the dirt from the clothing. </p>
<p><b>If I'm allergic to nuts, can I still use Soap Nuts?</b></p>
<p>Yes! Soap Nuts are not actually made out of a nut, but they are an outer shell of a berry. Soap Nuts are a hypo-allergenic, meaning that they are not likely to irritate sensitive skin.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Drumi made of?</strong></p>
<p>The Drumi is made of a combination of stainless steel, aluminum, and engineered plastic.</p>
<p><strong>How can I store the Drumi?</strong></p>
<p>The Drumi is very compact and portable, making it easy to store in small spaces and areas. Because of its materials, it can be stored in both wet and dry areas.</p>
<p><strong>Do you offer any different models?</strong></p>
<p>Currently we are offering the newest version of the Drumi. We plan to develop other models down the road in order to meet the needs for our various user segments.</p>
<p><b>What will happen if you don't reach the campaign goal? Will I still receive my Drumi?</b></p>
<p>Yes! You will receive your Drumi no matter what. We are doing flexible funding, which means we will receive all of the funds raised regardless if we hit our goal or not.</p>

The Drumi spins the clothes, leaving them a little bit damp. They can then be hung to dry.
Do I need to find a nearby power supply? 
No, this product does not require any energy consumption and is powered entirely by a foot pedal.
What is the cost per load?
The Drumi is very cost-effective. There is no additional cost for energy and the Drumi actually saves the user money. This is because it reduces the use of a standard washing machine. 
What type of detergents can I use?
Liquid, powder detergent or any type of detergent alternatives you may use. If the user chooses an eco-friendly detergent, they will have an entirely renewable laundry  experience.
What are Soap Nuts?
Soap Nuts are a natural laundry detergent alternative. There are a natural surfactant that separates the dirt from the clothing. 
If I'm allergic to nuts, can I still use Soap Nuts?
Yes! Soap Nuts are not actually made out of a nut, but they are an outer shell of a berry. Soap Nuts are a hypo-allergenic, meaning that they are not likely to irritate sensitive skin.
What is the Drumi made of?
The Drumi is made of a combination of stainless steel, aluminum, and engineered plastic.
How can I store the Drumi?
The Drumi is very compact and portable, making it easy to store in small spaces and areas. Because of its materials, it can be stored in both wet and dry areas.
Do you offer any different models?
Currently we are offering the newest version of the Drumi. We plan to develop other models down the road in order to meet the needs for our various user segments.
What will happen if you don't reach the campaign goal? Will I still receive my Drumi?
Yes! You will receive your Drumi no matter what. We are doing flexible funding, which means we will receive all of the funds raised regardless if we hit our goal or not.",37.0,1,"1 Campaign

With more than 100,000 devices in consumer’s homes today across North America and Europe, we have delivered a robust app and cloud solution that reliably sends alerts and notifications to your smartphone. </p><p>With our new Garage Door Sensor, we started with this same Wi-Fi chip, micro processing technology and cloud based platform solution from our existing products. We then built a device where we added a small accelerometer, a 2-year lithium battery and a software algorithm that accurately senses the horizontal and vertical motion of your garage door to determine the state of the door: open or closed.</p><p>Whenever the garage door opens, the Garage Door Sensor sends a signal through your home Wi-Fi and then to the Roost cloud. This triggers a notification to your smartphone telling you that your garage is open. By using the app, you can set up how frequently you would like to get these notifications, whether it’s every time the door opens, or just specific times when you want to be notified.  </p><p>Note: you must have access to Wi-Fi and a smartphone.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524594950/kjpr8k96s0xdk3zueluz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Use Cases</h3><ol>

</li>
<li>Have you ever been 5 miles down the road and your spouse turns to you and asks if you remembered to close the garage door? <ul><li>We have a <strong>“door still open” </strong>timer feature in our app that allows you to set a time between 1 minute and 10 minutes to automatically trigger a notification if your garage door is left open after driving away. </li></ul>
</li>
<li>Have you ever wondered if your teenagers arrived home during the time period that they said they would? <ul><li>We have a <strong>“door not opened when it should be”</strong> feature that allows you to specify a timeframe of when your garage door should have opened. Receive a notification if your teen does not arrive home by that 4pm time you agreed to. </li></ul>

</ol><h3>A little background on us</h3><p>Roost is a Smart Home startup based in Sunnyvale, CA that was founded in 2014.

Monitor the activity of your garage door openings and closings throughout the day.
Ability to tune the frequency of the door notifications to your personal preferences or turn off completely.
Roost smart garage door sensor helps you to monitor the ""heartbeat of your home.""
  How does it work?Over the last several years, we have worked to create a free mobile app that already has functionality for our earlier two products, the Roost Smart Battery and the Roost Smart Water Leak and Freeze Detector. With more than 100,000 devices in consumer’s homes today across North America and Europe, we have delivered a robust app and cloud solution that reliably sends alerts and notifications to your smartphone. With our new Garage Door Sensor, we started with this same Wi-Fi chip, micro processing technology and cloud based platform solution from our existing products. We then built a device where we added a small accelerometer, a 2-year lithium battery and a software algorithm that accurately senses the horizontal and vertical motion of your garage door to determine the state of the door: open or closed.Whenever the garage door opens, the Garage Door Sensor sends a signal through your home Wi-Fi and then to the Roost cloud. This triggers a notification to your smartphone telling you that your garage is open. By using the app, you can set up how frequently you would like to get these notifications, whether it’s every time the door opens, or just specific times when you want to be notified.  Note: you must have access to Wi-Fi and a smartphone.Use Cases
Have you ever woken up in the morning only to realize that your garage door has been open all night long? We have a unique “before bedtime” app feature that allows you to receive a notification at a time of your choosing if your garage door is still open. 

Have you ever been 5 miles down the road and your spouse turns to you and asks if you remembered to close the garage door? We have a “door still open” timer feature in our app that allows you to set a time between 1 minute and 10 minutes to automatically trigger a notification if your garage door is left open after driving away. 

Have you ever wondered if your teenagers arrived home during the time period that they said they would? We have a “door not opened when it should be” feature that allows you to specify a timeframe of when your garage door should have opened. Receive a notification if your teen does not arrive home by that 4pm time you agreed to. 

How do I set up the Smart Garage Door Sensor in my home?Easily! The process of opening your Roost Smart Garage Door Sensor package, connecting it to your home’s Wi-Fi and installing it on your garage door takes less than 5 minutes. No wires, hubs or professionals needed.
Download the Roost Smart Home App
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the App to connect your garage door sensor to your home’s Wi-Fi.
Uncover the double sided tape on the back of the garage door sensor’s clip and place it near the top your garage door. Or, use the included screws to attach the clip to your garage door.
Set custom notifications within the App to remain “in the know” about the state of your garage door at all times.

<p><strong>MÄNNKITCHEN MK9: The knife that’s not for everybody.</strong></p>
<p>The MK9 is large.  Too large for some.</p>
<p>The MK9 is heavier than most chef knives.</p>
<p>The blade of the MK9 is longer than the standard 8 inches.</p>
<p>It's wide.  So wide you can’t touch your knuckles to the cutting board.</p>
<p>It’s hard.  We chose very hard Nitrogen steel, even though it takes longer to sharpen.</p>
<p>The MK9 was not made for everyone.</p>
<p>Read on to see if it was made for you. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571784702/zqoz0ayrlurk9vhrulpf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 1: The Steel </p>
<p>The MK9 Blade is made of revolutionary X63-Nitrogen Steel. The addition of nitrogen during the alloying process creates a tighter grain structure within the steel, enabling surgical sharpness, exceptional edge retention, improved corrosion resistance, and hardness up to 63 HRC.</p>
<p>X63-Nitrogen Steel is made in the USA. Its special properties allow it to outperform market leading imported steels in edge retention, durability, and corrosion resistance.</p>
<p>In short, it's the perfect knife steel for professional kitchens.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571784862/xr5jnv5krs6fzb8y11yz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 2: The Shape</p>
<p>The MK9 features a Convex Spine Profile.  Unlike most knives, it curves downward at both ends, enabling a more natural wrist position while cutting that reduces wrist strain and helps prevent wedging in large ingredients.</p>
<p>If you spend a lot of time with a knife in your hands, your elbow, wrist, and knife hand will thank you for using an MK9.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571785019/okmykstqo6hferqijkaa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 3: Extra Width</p>
<p>Over 2.5 inch blade width at the heel increases knuckle clearance, eases food transfer &amp; extends blade life.  With most chef knives you need to be careful not to scrape your knuckles on the cutting board when you complete your chop.  Cooks compensate by cutting near the counter/table edges to save their knuckles.  With the MK9, that's no longer a concern. </p>
<p>Wide blade makes food transfer quick and easy.</p>
<p>Plus, there's enough width that you can sharpen it for a generation or two and still have a magnificent blade for your heirs to fight over.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571785676/pftmndes7slioavoqxx6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 4: Extra Length</p>
<p>9 Inch blade for improved slicing and making quick work of large ingredients.  The blade features a relatively straight edge for the bulk of its length, with the belly concentrated in the front 1/3.  This enables it to perform well whether chopping or slicing, and it has the length to handle large ingredients quickly.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571785762/cgv4xseuxvnh6yj5agmx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 6: Extra Comfort</p>
<p>The MK9 features a rounded &amp; polished spine for exceptional comfort in a pinch grip. Cooks often develop a callous on their index finger where the spine presses against the skin.  An unpolished spine with square edges creates friction while cutting, leading to discomfort, blistering, and a ""cook's callous"".  </p>
<p>Cutting is more comfortable with the MK9.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571785868/pt714j2f22ylfyto3t0i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 2: Exceptional Grip</p>
<p>Ergonomic large handle cradles the hand for an effortlessly firm grip-even for those with large hands.  We eliminated angular edges and added both width and thickness to create a substantial handle that feels like a natural extension of the arm.</p>
<p>Scales are made of indestructible G10, with layers of resin-encased fibers creating a nonslip material (whether wet or dry) that won't swell, shrink, crack, or discolor.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571785909/pblmvf2206yzy6j3b5u2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 7: Micro Bolster</p>
<p>The MK9 Micro Bolster features all the safety benefits of a full bolster with none of the drawbacks.  A bolster adds stability to your grip and to the blade, while protecting your hand with added width where fingers contact the heel.  While traditional bolsters extend the whole length of the heel to the edge, the micro bolster of the MK9 only adds width where it's needed, allowing easy point-to-heel sharpening.</p>

<p><strong>A great chef knife won't transform anyone into a great cook. </strong></p>
<p>What a great knife can do is turn work into pleasure. We get better at whatever we practice, and we practice more when practice is enjoyable.  </p>
<p>Cutting with the MK9 is fun.   </p>

<p>Hello, my name is Cleve, and I cook at home.</p>
<p>Learning to cook is an adventure that for me began over 30 years ago with one-too-many bowls of oatmeal.  Along the way, I learned that meals cooked at home are less expensive, more nutritious, and allow greater control over what we consume.   </p>
<p>Every new dish develops and sharpens skills that I can use to serve myself and others. Many of my favorite memories are around a table sharing a meal with friends and family.</p>
<p>And men who know how to cook experience other benefits: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>""I do love a man who can cook.""</strong></p>
<p>-Emma B. from the Spice Girls</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“My weaknesses have always been food and men — in that order.” </strong></p>
<p>- Dolly Parton</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>""I have yet to meet a woman who doesn’t think a man who cooks is sexy.”</strong></p>
<p>-Mary M. from Quora</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>""What's for dinner?""</strong></p>
<p>-My wife</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The MK9 is function-first kitchen tool. Every detail of the design is functional, from the materials, to the profile, to each contour of the handle and micro bolster. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Size comparison with popular chef knives: </p>

<p>There are no decorative Damascus patterns or faux hammer marks on the blade, just revolutionary American made Nitro-X63 steel, designed and built to work for generations.  </p>
<p><strong>""My husband loves his new knife-shows it to me proudly every time he uses it!""</strong></p>
<p>-Carol H.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NITRO-X63 Details:</p>
<p>NITRO-X63 Composition (Nominal) 0.85-0.95 Carbon, 1.0 Mn, .03 P, .01 S, 1.0 Si, 15.0-17.0 Cr, 0.50 Mo, 0.10-.15 Nitrogen NITRO-X63 is a nitrogen-bearing, high-carbon chromium martensitic steel that is balanced to provide superior hardness capability.  NITRO-X63 can achieve a tempered hardness of HRC 60-63. NITRO-X63 resists corrosion from mild atmospheres, fresh water, steam, ammonia, many petroleum products and organic materials and several mild acid environments. NITRO-X63 is an excellent candidate for cutlery applications that demand high hardness, edge retention and corrosion resistance.  Many of you will recognize this steel by a different name.  There is no subterfuge or tomfoolery. The reason I'm not using the other name is that I was asked (politely) not to.  </p>
<p>So, Better Don't noONE Narc, ok?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A with MÄNNKITCHEN founder Cleve Oines</strong></p>
<p>Before you part with your hard-earned cash, I expect you have some questions for me, like:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why are you doing this?</strong></p>
<p>I've been frustrated with knives that can't hold a fine edge. Angular handles that look amazing and cause amazing blisters.  Chef knives with small toy-like handles and narrow blades. The emphasis on appearance over function is rampant in kitchen knives.  Does 144 layers of hammered samurai space steel help me make dinner?  No? Then keep it.</p>
<p>I want a knife that is built to work, and was unable to find a chef knife that had all the practical features I wanted.</p>
<p>Guys cook at home now.  Millions of us.  I suspect that others have experienced the same frustrations I have.  </p>
<p>Will the MK9 be perfect for everyone?  No.  </p>
<p>If the features appeal to you, it's for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why say it's built for the ""man"" who loves to cook?</strong></p>
<p>Because it's true.  I'm the man who loves to cook that it was built for. It isn't my intent to exclude anyone, but the knife was designed based on my experiences with many knives, and I prefer a larger handle and blade.   </p>
<p>While all the other features are beneficial to everyone, I wanted to be sure people knew that the MK9 was significantly larger than average because that feature won't appeal to everyone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Should I trust you?</strong> </p>
<p>I wouldn't ask you to carry the risk alone. If your MK9 doesn’t arrive before March 1, 2020 you may cancel your order and receive a full refund for undelivered item(s). That's my promise to you.</p>
<p>Look Mom, no risk!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571792372/rwquobd0fveoew5x6okl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I'm the one on the left, with the amazing lady who taught me to cook.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What do you know about kitchen knives?</strong></p>
<p>I started cooking at age 8 using my mom’s carbon steel Sabatier chef’s knives. A knife enthusiast since childhood, I've used many different chef knives as an avid home cook, a cook on commercial fishing boats in Alaska, and in professional kitchens.  I designed and built my first knife when I was 13 years old.</p>
<p>All told, I've spent thousands of hours with a knife in my hand, learning through trial and error which features make a real difference in practical use.  </p>
<p>The design of the MK9 is born from my desire to combine the most useful features into a single cook's knife.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Have you ever designed anything before?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I studied design at university, and have designed dozens of products for clients over the years.  For this project, I also have manufacturing and design partners that specialize in kitchen knives, because I don't know what I don't know.</p>
<p>In the almost 2 years since this process began, I've learned a lot.  The first prototypes were printed more than a year ago.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What inspired the design?</strong></p>
<p>The lines of the MK9 are inspired by a famous Norwegian sailing hull design. Capable of slicing through the water at maximum speed with minimal resistance, Norse longboats were the technological advantage that enabled the Viking era.  </p>
<p>With the number of US men who cook at home increasing by almost 50% in the last 50 years, we're in a new era now. Hopefully one with less pillaging.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do I need to have giant Viking hands to use this knife?</strong></p>
<p>No.  The MK9 is comfortable for all adult hand sizes-including those with large hands.</p>
<p>During the testing phase, I had a demo model in my kitchen (still do) that has become the favorite knife of my 13 year old daughter, and she has smaller hands than most men.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will you actually get the product to me?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I've worked in eCommerce for over 10 years, and have directly sold millions of dollars worth of goods generating hundreds of 5 star reviews and thousands of happy customers while gaining experience in product design, sourcing, shipping, and customer service.</p>
<p>I’ve had unhappy customers too, and have learned valuable lessons from both* of them.</p>
<p>*There were more than 2. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will you marry my sister?</strong></p>
<p>I’m flattered that you would ask, and taken completely off-guard by this question.  </p>
<p>Thank you, but I’m happily married.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571792443/khtarnz2e6wec2yypzvi.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why are you doing this now?</p>
<p>I was laid off.  Embarrassing, I know. More accurately, my contract was not renewed by a business I helped build over 15 years. I was quite suddenly without my primary source of income.</p>
<p>It was a firm shove into the unfamiliar, and one that I sorely needed.  It's hard for me to change direction when I'm comfortable.  </p>
<p>Very suddenly, I had to adjust to a new reality. My immediate instinct was to leap at the next familiar position that would pay the bills. So I did some interviews. </p>
<p>In one of the interviews I was asked, ""What would you do tomorrow if you could do anything?""  </p>
<p>It's a really good question.</p>
<p>I was still thinking about it later that night.</p>
<p>For me, the answer wasn't to find another position similar to the one I was comfortable in. The answer was to align my experience in design with my natural interest in cooking.</p>
<p>I contacted the company and withdrew my name from consideration.   Of course it could be that they weren't planning to hire me, but to me it was a turning point because I wasn't looking for a J-O-B anymore, I was building something I believe in.</p>
<p>I've always loved creating in the kitchen.  Discovering a new dish and finding a way to make it better (or at least make it at home) fascinates me.  Improving a tool or solving a problem is deeply satisfying.</p>
<p>I like to make things better by making better things.  </p>
<p>While I'm unqualified to solve many problems, I can help some with the problems I've had myself.    </p>
<p>My goal for MÄNNKITCHEN isn't just to sell kitchen tools.  It's to build a community where people who cook at home can help each other make things better.  I hope you'll join me.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Last question: What’s the story with the name MÄNNKITCHEN?</strong></p>
<p>My heritage is Norwegian, and männ is the possessive form of “my” in a dialect of old Norse, so MÄNNKITCHEN = my kitchen.</p>
<p>If you cook, MÄNNKITCHEN is for you.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571792485/bbcvqni6cum1vca1mpoa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I'm only cross-eyed when I juggle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will you do me a favor?</strong></p>
<p>It took a year and a half, countless prototypes, thousands of hours, and more than a few dollars to develop the MK9 into something worth sharing.   </p>
<p>And now I need your help.</p>
<p>The money you pledge will be used to purchase the raw materials, skilled labor and custom tooling needed for a full production run of the MK9. </p>
<p>You can help make this possible.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","MÄNNKITCHEN MK9: The knife that’s not for everybody.
The MK9 is large.  Too large for some.
The MK9 is heavier than most chef knives.
The blade of the MK9 is longer than the standard 8 inches.
It's wide.  So wide you can’t touch your knuckles to the cutting board.
It’s hard.  We chose very hard Nitrogen steel, even though it takes longer to sharpen.
The MK9 was not made for everyone.
Read on to see if it was made for you. 

 
MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 1: The Steel 
The MK9 Blade is made of revolutionary X63-Nitrogen Steel. The addition of nitrogen during the alloying process creates a tighter grain structure within the steel, enabling surgical sharpness, exceptional edge retention, improved corrosion resistance, and hardness up to 63 HRC.
X63-Nitrogen Steel is made in the USA. Its special properties allow it to outperform market leading imported steels in edge retention, durability, and corrosion resistance.
In short, it's the perfect knife steel for professional kitchens.  

MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 2: The Shape
The MK9 features a Convex Spine Profile.  Unlike most knives, it curves downward at both ends, enabling a more natural wrist position while cutting that reduces wrist strain and helps prevent wedging in large ingredients.
If you spend a lot of time with a knife in your hands, your elbow, wrist, and knife hand will thank you for using an MK9.

MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 3: Extra Width
Over 2.5 inch blade width at the heel increases knuckle clearance, eases food transfer & extends blade life.  With most chef knives you need to be careful not to scrape your knuckles on the cutting board when you complete your chop.  Cooks compensate by cutting near the counter/table edges to save their knuckles.  With the MK9, that's no longer a concern. 
Wide blade makes food transfer quick and easy.
Plus, there's enough width that you can sharpen it for a generation or two and still have a magnificent blade for your heirs to fight over.

 
MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 4: Extra Length
9 Inch blade for improved slicing and making quick work of large ingredients.  The blade features a relatively straight edge for the bulk of its length, with the belly concentrated in the front 1/3.  This enables it to perform well whether chopping or slicing, and it has the length to handle large ingredients quickly.

MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 6: Extra Comfort
The MK9 features a rounded & polished spine for exceptional comfort in a pinch grip. Cooks often develop a callous on their index finger where the spine presses against the skin.  An unpolished spine with square edges creates friction while cutting, leading to discomfort, blistering, and a ""cook's callous"".  
Cutting is more comfortable with the MK9.

MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 2: Exceptional Grip
Ergonomic large handle cradles the hand for an effortlessly firm grip-even for those with large hands.  We eliminated angular edges and added both width and thickness to create a substantial handle that feels like a natural extension of the arm.
Scales are made of indestructible G10, with layers of resin-encased fibers creating a nonslip material (whether wet or dry) that won't swell, shrink, crack, or discolor.  

MÄNNKITCHEN MK9 Difference 7: Micro Bolster
The MK9 Micro Bolster features all the safety benefits of a full bolster with none of the drawbacks.  A bolster adds stability to your grip and to the blade, while protecting your hand with added width where fingers contact the heel.  While traditional bolsters extend the whole length of the heel to the edge, the micro bolster of the MK9 only adds width where it's needed, allowing easy point-to-heel sharpening.

 

A great chef knife won't transform anyone into a great cook. 
What a great knife can do is turn work into pleasure. We get better at whatever we practice, and we practice more when practice is enjoyable.  
Cutting with the MK9 is fun.   


 

Don't let my expression of intense concentration fool you, I want to have fun and keep all my fingers.  Plus, cutting things in half with a big smile wasn't a good look.
 
""I pick up this knife and feel formidable in the kitchen.""
-Captain Alaska (R. Hughey)
Also, MÄNNKITCHEN isn't only about high quality kitchen tools.  You can follow our food adventures, learn how to make meals you want to eat, and share your own kitchen triumphs and defeats with the #mannkitchen hashtag on instagram and at mannkitchen.com.
There's just a few things any of us can teach, but what we can learn together is unlimited.  Seth Godin said ""Learning is voluntary. Learning is always available, and it compounds, because once we’ve acquired it, we can use it again and again.""
Let's play with fire and sharp objects together. 

Hello, my name is Cleve, and I cook at home.
Learning to cook is an adventure that for me began over 30 years ago with one-too-many bowls of oatmeal.  Along the way, I learned that meals cooked at home are less expensive, more nutritious, and allow greater control over what we consume.   
Every new dish develops and sharpens skills that I can use to serve myself and others. Many of my favorite memories are around a table sharing a meal with friends and family.
And men who know how to cook experience other benefits: 
 
""I do love a man who can cook.""
-Emma B. from the Spice Girls
 
“My weaknesses have always been food and men — in that order.” 
- Dolly Parton
 
""I have yet to meet a woman who doesn’t think a man who cooks is sexy.”
-Mary M. from Quora
 
""What's for dinner?""
-My wife
 
The MK9 is function-first kitchen tool. Every detail of the design is functional, from the materials, to the profile, to each contour of the handle and micro bolster. 
 
Size comparison with popular chef knives: 

There are no decorative Damascus patterns or faux hammer marks on the blade, just revolutionary American made Nitro-X63 steel, designed and built to work for generations.  
""My husband loves his new knife-shows it to me proudly every time he uses it!""
-Carol H.
 
NITRO-X63 Details:
NITRO-X63 Composition (Nominal) 0.85-0.95 Carbon, 1.0 Mn, .03 P, .01 S, 1.0 Si, 15.0-17.0 Cr, 0.50 Mo, 0.10-.15 Nitrogen NITRO-X63 is a nitrogen-bearing, high-carbon chromium martensitic steel that is balanced to provide superior hardness capability.  NITRO-X63 can achieve a tempered hardness of HRC 60-63. NITRO-X63 resists corrosion from mild atmospheres, fresh water, steam, ammonia, many petroleum products and organic materials and several mild acid environments. NITRO-X63 is an excellent candidate for cutlery applications that demand high hardness, edge retention and corrosion resistance.  Many of you will recognize this steel by a different name.  There is no subterfuge or tomfoolery. The reason I'm not using the other name is that I was asked (politely) not to.  
So, Better Don't noONE Narc, ok?
 
 
Q&A with MÄNNKITCHEN founder Cleve Oines
Before you part with your hard-earned cash, I expect you have some questions for me, like:
 
Why are you doing this?
I've been frustrated with knives that can't hold a fine edge. Angular handles that look amazing and cause amazing blisters.  Chef knives with small toy-like handles and narrow blades. The emphasis on appearance over function is rampant in kitchen knives.  Does 144 layers of hammered samurai space steel help me make dinner?  No? Then keep it.
I want a knife that is built to work, and was unable to find a chef knife that had all the practical features I wanted.
Guys cook at home now.  Millions of us.  I suspect that others have experienced the same frustrations I have.  
Will the MK9 be perfect for everyone?  No.  
If the features appeal to you, it's for you.
 
Why say it's built for the ""man"" who loves to cook?
Because it's true.  I'm the man who loves to cook that it was built for. It isn't my intent to exclude anyone, but the knife was designed based on my experiences with many knives, and I prefer a larger handle and blade.   
While all the other features are beneficial to everyone, I wanted to be sure people knew that the MK9 was significantly larger than average because that feature won't appeal to everyone.
 
 
Should I trust you? 
I wouldn't ask you to carry the risk alone. If your MK9 doesn’t arrive before March 1, 2020 you may cancel your order and receive a full refund for undelivered item(s). That's my promise to you.
Look Mom, no risk!

I'm the one on the left, with the amazing lady who taught me to cook.
 
What do you know about kitchen knives?
I started cooking at age 8 using my mom’s carbon steel Sabatier chef’s knives. A knife enthusiast since childhood, I've used many different chef knives as an avid home cook, a cook on commercial fishing boats in Alaska, and in professional kitchens.  I designed and built my first knife when I was 13 years old.
All told, I've spent thousands of hours with a knife in my hand, learning through trial and error which features make a real difference in practical use.  
The design of the MK9 is born from my desire to combine the most useful features into a single cook's knife.
 
Have you ever designed anything before?
Yes, I studied design at university, and have designed dozens of products for clients over the years.  For this project, I also have manufacturing and design partners that specialize in kitchen knives, because I don't know what I don't know.
In the almost 2 years since this process began, I've learned a lot.  The first prototypes were printed more than a year ago.
 
What inspired the design?
The lines of the MK9 are inspired by a famous Norwegian sailing hull design. Capable of slicing through the water at maximum speed with minimal resistance, Norse longboats were the technological advantage that enabled the Viking era.  
With the number of US men who cook at home increasing by almost 50% in the last 50 years, we're in a new era now. Hopefully one with less pillaging.
 
Do I need to have giant Viking hands to use this knife?
No.  The MK9 is comfortable for all adult hand sizes-including those with large hands.
During the testing phase, I had a demo model in my kitchen (still do) that has become the favorite knife of my 13 year old daughter, and she has smaller hands than most men.  
 
Will you actually get the product to me?
Yes. I've worked in eCommerce for over 10 years, and have directly sold millions of dollars worth of goods generating hundreds of 5 star reviews and thousands of happy customers while gaining experience in product design, sourcing, shipping, and customer service.
I’ve had unhappy customers too, and have learned valuable lessons from both* of them.
*There were more than 2. 
 
Will you marry my sister?
I’m flattered that you would ask, and taken completely off-guard by this question.  
Thank you, but I’m happily married.

 
Why are you doing this now?
I was laid off.  Embarrassing, I know. More accurately, my contract was not renewed by a business I helped build over 15 years. I was quite suddenly without my primary source of income.
It was a firm shove into the unfamiliar, and one that I sorely needed.  It's hard for me to change direction when I'm comfortable.  
Very suddenly, I had to adjust to a new reality. My immediate instinct was to leap at the next familiar position that would pay the bills. So I did some interviews. 
In one of the interviews I was asked, ""What would you do tomorrow if you could do anything?""  
It's a really good question.
I was still thinking about it later that night.
For me, the answer wasn't to find another position similar to the one I was comfortable in. The answer was to align my experience in design with my natural interest in cooking.
I contacted the company and withdrew my name from consideration.   Of course it could be that they weren't planning to hire me, but to me it was a turning point because I wasn't looking for a J-O-B anymore, I was building something I believe in.
I've always loved creating in the kitchen.  Discovering a new dish and finding a way to make it better (or at least make it at home) fascinates me.  Improving a tool or solving a problem is deeply satisfying.
I like to make things better by making better things.  
While I'm unqualified to solve many problems, I can help some with the problems I've had myself.    
My goal for MÄNNKITCHEN isn't just to sell kitchen tools.  It's to build a community where people who cook at home can help each other make things better.  I hope you'll join me.  
 
Last question: What’s the story with the name MÄNNKITCHEN?
My heritage is Norwegian, and männ is the possessive form of “my” in a dialect of old Norse, so MÄNNKITCHEN = my kitchen.
If you cook, MÄNNKITCHEN is for you.

I'm only cross-eyed when I juggle.
 
Will you do me a favor?
It took a year and a half, countless prototypes, thousands of hours, and more than a few dollars to develop the MK9 into something worth sharing.   
And now I need your help.
The money you pledge will be used to purchase the raw materials, skilled labor and custom tooling needed for a full production run of the MK9. 
You can help make this possible.
 
Supporters will receive the MK9 for 40% off retail.

<h2>Introducing Deep Cut</h2>
<p>Give your vinyl records the home they deserve up on the wall with a simple, beautiful, scalable, quality shelving system.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b12ed8d4cde7a9e294078b4/t/5b988c5e6d2a7391a85a9798/1536724084463/Cube_Animation.gif%E2%80%9C"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>What's wrong with other record storage and display options? It is mostly glorified stackable milk crates, multi-thousand-dollar consoles, or stuff that doesn't hold much or wasn't really designed for records. And most of it is low to the ground. What's with that? Why can't we get our collection up on the wall at eye level where it is easy to browse and display (without turning to big box store cheap stuff)? And a storage system that looks great and can expand as we buy more records? Because we will buy more records.</p>
<p><strong>But let's back up...</strong></p>
<p>We are two brothers (Clark and Rich) and a cousin (Rob) that love vinyl. We love the ritual of leafing through our collections, whiskey in hand, looking for the perfect record for the moment. We don’t love sitting on the floor or bending down while we make these important choices.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536725595/twoukqjotodwlcjgh8m0.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We grew up together, but then went separate ways (Minnesota, Pennsylvania, DC, Atlanta, New Zealand, and so on) on separate careers. Rob went into construction, carpentry, and woodwork. Rich went down the marketing path. And Clark into corporate finance. We had always talked about combining our powers and starting a business together, but didn’t know exactly what that business would be. Then Rich’s dog got ahold of some of his precious records that were being stored on the bottom shelf of a bookcase. The horror! So he called Rob and asked “Why are my records sitting on the floor? Why can’t I just hang them on the wall, safe where I can see them?” “Give me a couple days,"" Rob responded. He came back with the design. Clark resoundingly approved. We knew we had our idea.</p>

<p>After some discussions in the vinyl community, we found others wanted what we wanted: something with a simple and practical design. Something made out of quality materials with a minimalist look. Something easy to install that you could put just about anywhere. Something you could scale up as your collection grows. So here we are. Introducing Deep Cut record shelves.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>""Why is this so much better than other options?""</h3>
<p><strong>Off the Floor: </strong>The only wall-mounted system designed for records that is high quality, scalable, modular, and easy to install all at the same time with this kind of capacity. You can only check some of those boxes (no pun intended...okay a little intended) with other options.</p>
<p><strong>Scalable, Modular: </strong>Allows for easy additions when you gotta have more space for your collection and simple moves to change orientation when you need or just want to.</p>
<p><strong>Handmade in the US with Care: </strong>Solid construction from quality hardwood materials, handmade in the US (Minnesota to be exact). </p>
<p><strong>Minimalist Design</strong>: Clean, simple look that works in a wide range of spaces and decors</p>
<p><strong>Easy</strong>: We designed this system to be incredibly easy to install right out of the box (no flat-packing!) in any orientation in virtually any space.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>
<strong>So why an Indiegogo campaign</strong>?</h3>
<p>We are passionate about this product and system, and dedicated to making it all right here in the US. But we need money for space, tools, and materials so that we can scale up production without sacrificing quality. With your help, we can make this business a reality and get more great products out into the world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536534696/nznrihhccnq9imnzcwjo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Well, obviously, backing our campaign would be the absolute best. Hard to ask for anything more. How much should you contribute, you ask? It’s totally up to you.  Every dollar helps, but the more you can support us, the more you get in return.</p>
<p>Want to hang some of these beauties in your home as soon as possible? Back us by “Selecting a Perk” for the color and number of shelves you want.  </p>
<p>Not in the market for shelves at the moment? You can still help out!  Simply click “<strong>BACK IT</strong>” to provide general support and donate any amount that works for you. How generous and selfless you are!</p>
<p>Here's the other thing: <strong>Most crowdfunding campaigns make or break within the first week or less</strong>. That's not always the case, but if you don't show that people are interested by then, it can get tough. So, that's another way of saying, if you're going to back us, <strong>the earlier the better!</strong> Missed that chance? No problem, the ""mid-campaign plateau"" (e.g. slow in momentum after the initial wave) is also real. Help us get that line to go up again!</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What Your Support Provides &amp; What You get</h3>
<p><strong>What do we do with all the generous support?</strong></p>
<p>Build a business! We need to upgrade the electrical system of our woodshop, install a  dust collection system, purchase tools like edge banders, jigsaws, and routers, and get tables, jigs and fixtures set up so that we can produce at scale without sacrificing quality or losing any fingers. We need equipment to offload wood deliveries and move materials around the shop. But none of this is possible without early-adopter customers like you who love what we're making and aren't shy about it!</p>
<p><strong>What do you get as a backer?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536759765/efcszeuw1gkjgeccfios.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Depending on your contribution, you’ll become one of the first to get these beautiful units and at a nice discount. You get attractive, versatile, scalable shelving that makes your records (or whatever) look great up on your wall. There will be some other surprises along the way, but this is really all about giving your vinyl a better home.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you care about your vinyl, want a simply, stylish way to display it in your home, and want to have an easier time navigating your collection, Deep Cut is  to you. If you like clean, minimalist design and simple, scalable shelving systems that are extra easy to use and install (even if you are not a vinyl person), Deep Cut is for to you. And if you care about where your stuff comes from and how it is made, Deep Cut is for to you.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Product Specifications:</strong></h3>
<p>​<strong>Materials</strong>: Initially available in walnut (darker color) and hard maple (lighter), with more varieties to come once we're off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>System</strong>: A design-forward version of the age-old French cleat system, using a simple cleat secured to the wall allowing the units to drop on securely.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity</strong>: 50 - 65 records per unit (depending on specific records)</p>
<p><strong>Dimensions:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536810815/vrt339ytumvwmc3fklnd.png"" src=""""/></p>

<li>Shelf - External: 15 inches tall x 15 inches wide x 13 1/4 inches deep</li>
<li>Shelf - Internal: 13 1/2 inches tall x 13 1/2 inches wide x 12 1/2 inches deep</li>
<li>Wall Cleat: 4 inches tall (at tallest point) x 17 1/2 inches wide x 3/4 inch deep. Mounting holes pre-drilled 16 inches apart (3/4 inch from each edge) that lines up with drywall studs in most modern construction homes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weight</strong>: When empty, they are approximately 13 pounds (including wall cleat) per unit. Fully loaded with records, typically 65 - 85 pounds (depending on records) per unit.</p>
<p><strong>Assembly Required</strong>: Nope, no flat packing or weird tools. The build is complete. Once the wall cleat is installed (hardware included), you're good to go.</p>

<h3><strong>Installation</strong></h3>

<p><strong>What you do: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the location for the unit and use a stud finder to locate the studs. In many homes, the studs are spaced 16 inches apart from center which lines up perfectly with the pre-drilled hole (if that's not the case, an included high-grade wall anchor can be used for one of the sides). </li>
<li>Hold the wall cleat to the wall at the location you wish to place it and make sure it is level, using a level, then mark the spots with a pencil (or pen or screw).<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536697589/oy3efl6s5z27m1kaycj4.png"" src=""""/>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Building shelves isn’t rocket science. Our main risks are demand and production scale. If we don’t get enough capital to invest in our space, the right tools, and necessary materials and inventory, we may struggle to produce units. If we get too many orders, we may struggle to produce units quickly enough to fill them.</p>
<p>This is what we have done to mitigate the risk: We did a thorough analysis of our production time when we built the prototype. We built our crowdfunding goals and schedules around volumes we know we can produce. We have planned for scenarios where we are not able to purchase key pieces of equipment (production would be slower, but demand would be lower). We've got contingency plans. We've got contingency plans for out contingency plans.  Any way it goes, though, we are committed to transparent communication and doing right by our backers and customers and not putting anything substandard out into the world.</p>

We provide shipping to USA and international locations. Orders shipping outside of the United State will be subject to additional shipping charges and possible import/duty taxes or fees that are to be covered at the expense of the receiver. 
 

Risks & Challenges
Nearly every component of the Cora Coffee Brewer is completely custom built from the ground up. The product is completely manufacture ready, with suppliers selected and in place take the product to production promptly. The unlikely potential of slight design changes and timeline adjustments in the ""Manufacturing"" phase is possible.
Our shipping date estimates have a built in safety margin. You can rest assured that the Cora Coffee Brewer will not ship until it is 100% ready for our backers to enjoy.
Please feel free to contact us with any questions about the product, the timeline, or the production of the Cora Coffee Brewer. Our supporters will be kept frequently updated on progress.

No additional action is required for these updates by the parent or child. We regularly add new stories, jokes, games, and more to keep the toy interesting. Does STEMosaur speak any other languages?Currently, STEMosaur only speaks and understands English.*STEMosaur also caters for variances in accent via our speech recognition software e.g. British, Australian, etc. Can two or more kids share one STEMosaur?Absolutely! STEMosaur makes playtime fun for everyone. However, please keep in mind that STEMosaur cannot differentiate between voices and only retains information for a single user. What will the STEMosaur do if a child asks an inappropriate question or uses profanity?“It’s not polite to say that!” - Our child-friendly filters ensure each and every STEMosaur protects kids from content that is unsuitable and inappropriate. What is the Parent Panel?The Parent Panel is a secure, log-in only dashboard where parents can view learning metrics, edit account settings and access the coding panel. In the not so distant future parents will also be able to add additional product features through the parent panel. Do CogniToys collect kids’ data? How safe is the toy?Privacy is our top priority. We collect only the information necessary to improve the overall play experience. For example, when kids ask questions the STEMosaur doesn’t know, our content team receives an anonymized report to ensure that answers for these questions are added in the future. Data obtained from children is only retained for the amount of time necessary to improve the STEMosaur play experience. It is then deleted, though the statistical analysis remains. Parents can always remove all data collected at any point by resetting the toy through the CogniToys App. We do not sell any information, whether child-generated or received from parents, to 3rd parties. Does my child need to know how to code to use the coding panel?No - no previous coding experience is required to use and enjoy the coding panel. The coding panel is easy to navigate and contains instructions and examples to help kids learn how to code content into their very own STEMosaur. Does my child need access to a computer to use the coding panel?Yes, a computer with working wifi is required to access the coding panel.The coding panel can be accessed through the parent panel. How difficult is it to construct STEMosaur?Kids can build their STEMosaur from scratch with help from the construction guide included. However, STEMosaur is a toy for the whole family and we encourage parents to actively engage in the construction and use of STEMosaur. Is it easy to connect STEMosaur to WiFi?If you have any trouble we have easy to follow guides and videos on our website. Do you ship internationally?Yes. Shipping costs vary depending on the country, but we do ship internationally. Does STEMosaur come with any other voices?We plan to allow a child to choose a custom voice for their STEMosaur from the coding panel. *This feature may be rolled out after our Indiegogo campaign. What will my child learn from their STEMosaur?In addition to engineering and coding, STEMosaur helps kids learn everything from math and science to geography and history. Our experienced content team also send out weekly updates with new and relevant content to ensure your STEMosaur gets smarter with every update. You can also learn more about how to play with your STEMosaur on the Commands page on our website. Does STEMosaur come in any other colors?Not right now. Can STEMosaur be taken apart once built?To avoid excessive wear and tear we do not recommend that STEMosaur be taken apart once assembled. Do you have helpful advice on how to troubleshoot?We have many ways for you to learn about your STEMosaur - from the FAQ section on our website to our friendly customer service team who can be contacted at info@elementalpath.com. Be sure to also check out the Quick Start Guide included to learn more about what your CogniToy is doing.",38.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>sLAMPS is an open design for a 3d SL (Stereo Lithography) resin printer.  I've been working on it for the last few months and have gotten it to the point where it is ready to print -- once I get a good supply of resin.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>The printer works using a galvanometer and mirrors to steer a laser into a cured vat of resin.  The resin cures at 405nm (which the laser puts out) and turns the liquid pool (Of Zero VOC Environmentally friendly resin) into little Yoda heads and Pink Panther Ladies.</p>
<h3>Why do I need funding?</h3>
<p>I'm seeking funding for two reasons:</p>
<p>1) To be held accountable for my design to ensure that this design makes it into your hands before people are mistaken into spending a lot of money on something that doesn't need to be that expensive.</p>
<p>2) To accelerate my prototype.  Rather than developing pay-check to pay-check, I could make several big investment purchases that would speed up my development.</p>
<h3>Big purchases? Like what?</h3>
<p>Well, the funding, if received, would go towards:</p>
<p>* Resin Development / Manufacturing / Supplier. Most resin from commercial suppliers is sold in quantities that make protyping cost prohibitive.  In order to find the perfect resin, that is affordable -- I need to try a few suppliers, which gets expensive fast.</p>
<p>* Laser Cutter.  Currently, I spend A LOT of money on laser cutting service.  If I had a laser cutter in my shop, I would be able to save myself a lot of time and money in getting this printer to a shareable state.</p>
<h2>Why aren't you selling lots of full, assembled printers?</h2>
<p>The printer in its current state is still very much a beta.  The preference is to only sell printers &amp; kits at this stage to people who want to put in the elbow grease to continue to push Open SL printing futher.</p>
<p>The printers we are selling are put together and calibrated by hand here in our workshop, and done without bulk manufacturing.  Therefore, we have priced the printer accordingly.</p>
<h3>What have you done so far?</h3>

<p><b>OUR STORY:</b></p>
<p>We are three friends who came to the US to get our MBA’s at Babson College. Coming from Japan and India, tea is really important to our culture. With a growing tea market in the US of $2.4B, we thought that there must be a better way to use technology to create a better tea drinking experience. So, after discussing together, we decided to create Teplo, a simple yet elegant solution that combines modern technology with traditional tea drinking.</p>
<p>We’ve spent the past year designing and building both our hardware product as well as the technology that powers it. We’ve gone through countless prototypes and have tested it out on our classmates, who come from all over the world.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to launch Teplo and get it into the hands of tea enthusiasts all over the world and we need your help. With the money we raise from this campaign, we will be able to purchase tooling and thus kickstart the manufacturing process. We have the prototypes, have identified our suppliers and just need the capital to manufacture.</p>

</div><br/></div>","DEMOSUCCESS METRICSWHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT TEPLOTHE PRESS:INTRODUCING THE WORLD'S FIRST SMART BOTTLE FOR TEA LOVERSTeplo is a revolutionary smart bottle that allows tea drinkers to brew the perfect cup of tea by tracking and controlling brewing temperature and time, via a mobile app and extracts maximum health benefits from your tea. Instead of letting your tea get cold, a rechargeable battery hidden in the base of the bottle keeps the beverage at the preferred temperature for as long as 4 hours. Plus users can personalize their tea blends based on health and taste preferences, and order premium teas from all over the world on Teplo’s app.THE PROBLEM:Tea is the most popular drink in the world yet many tea drinkers don’t realize that getting the perfect cup of tea is actually quite complex and difficult; tea is extremely sensitive to temperature and brewing time. Compared to the way most typically brew tea: by simply throwing a tea bag in hot water and start drinking, we are ignoring taste, flavor, color and even the correct drinking temperature of the tea. The Teplo team spent the past year carefully engineering both the bottle and the technology that powers it and are excited to unveil our product and bring it to tea lovers around the world. Introducing the world’s smartest bottle for tea drinkers - simple and elegant!THE SOLUTION:Teplo combines technology with its unique design to allow for the most perfect tea drinking experience, unlike anything else.The glass bottle allows tea enthusiasts to appreciate the color of the tea, as well as to maintain the perfect temperature for a long period of time.HOW IT WORKSSelect the type of tea to brew.The app will notify you when to put the tea leaves at the right brewing temperature.App will notify when to remove the tea leaves after the required brewing time is complete.After the drinking temperature is reached the bottle will maintain that temperature for 4 hours.TEA PERSONALIZATION:Answer a few simple questions and get your own personalized tea to suit your taste and health preferences right at your door step using our app using our tea subscription package.
THE SPECS:
Teplo’s innovative design consists of a glass bottle with a thermo sensor, heater, Bluetooth communication module and two batteries. An internal battery is used to communicate with smart devices, and has an all-day battery life. An external battery maintains the drinking temperature for as long as four hours.
THE APP:
Teplo will provide a mobile application for iOS and Android, available from the App store and Google Play.
R&D:
We develop our technology in our in house R&D lab. We also leverage our capability by partnering with manufacturers across the world.

It is 100% eco-friendly, as it’s based on acrylate, which dissolves in water and contains no toxic paint chemicals (lead-free). This covering allows the wood to adapt to the humidity of the environment, which increases the product’s lifespan. Blocks covered with such lacquers don’t lose their color after being exposed to sunlight for a long time. Our blocks contain no flammable substances and are therefore fireproof.  <br/>Furthermore, it doesn’t totally overlay the wooden texture. So the result looks colorful but still natural. </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rJKClhOu4I?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>To connect the blocks, we use strong Neodymium magnets. They have the longest lifespan, losing only 1% of their strength in 100 years. The magnets are small, light-weight and lead-free. We use 7x7 mm cylindrical magnets with an axial magnetic field. Our magnets have a bonding force of 1.5 kg. <br/>Most importantly, they are implanted and securely sealed inside the wood. </p><div> </div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG2dK-eQboc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>We take safety very seriously, and we use independent consumer labs to make sure that everything is safe and certified before we ship it out to you. The final product will be CE-marked and compliant with the European Standard for Toys covered by EN-71 and REACH, as well as the equivalent US standards covered by ASTM F963 and CPSIA. </p><p>As such, we provide you with a lifetime warranty for our products, and we will replace any broken block free of charge including shipping. You will, however, have to send us the photo of the broken block to make sure it wasn’t misused. By the way, not a single replacement was claimed yet!<br/>We are confident in our quality and can guarantee you everlasting, enjoyable play with WUMBA. </p><p> </p><h2>Perks.</h2><p>Essentially all of the above, broken down on the right, and further explained below. If you still have questions, don't hesitate to contact us. We will be shipping all rewards from Ukraine with priority airmail. All shipments will have the tracking and all shipping cost are included to the pledges. As such, the parcels should be customs-friendly for all EU, UK and US backers.

We faced two bottlenecks - painting &amp; printing and fulfillment logistics - and we took steps to address both.</p><p>On the production side, the flow is now well established: <br/>- we improved the painting technology for faster and more efficient painting; <br/>- we changed the supplier of the lacquers for brighter and rich colors; <br/>- we changed the printing technology and use silk-screen printing instead of tampo-printing;</p><p>The fulfillment is fully buttoned up now as well. Global shipping has a way of delivering surprises, from airport strikes to customs delays. Furthermore, the rewards after the last campaign were shipped too close to Chrismas and some of them stuck in the ""postal jams"". However, we had a chance to experience different couriers. Thus we know which will work better for us this time. Least of our worries.</p><p>That being said, creating a toy is always a challenge – you must make it safe, you should make it playful and you'd better make it nice and attractive. While absolutely nothing is 100% foolproof in this world and even pigs can fly (with the proper gear, of course) we feel pretty confident that everything will be successfully managed and handled professionally.</p><p>Nevertheless, we will keep you posted on every update and you can contact us at any time here and at team@wumba.toys</p><p>So here it is, this is our new lineup.

She is cute, pink and enjoys yoga like a WUMBA Lion. This is a Brachiosaurus and his name is Brachio. It is as flexible and stretchable as only WUMBA Crocodile can be. But look how many dinosaurs one can make mixing them.  The Monsters. This is a Troll. The cutest monster ever and it likes sunbathing.This is a Pudding Monster. It snuggles up, fawns like a cat and it has many spots. This is an Aquamonster. Obviously, it likes swimming.

Blocks covered with such lacquers don’t lose their color after being exposed to sunlight for a long time. Our blocks contain no flammable substances and are therefore fireproof.  Furthermore, it doesn’t totally overlay the wooden texture. So the result looks colorful but still natural. To connect the blocks, we use strong Neodymium magnets. They have the longest lifespan, losing only 1% of their strength in 100 years. The magnets are small, light-weight and lead-free. We use 7x7 mm cylindrical magnets with an axial magnetic field. Our magnets have a bonding force of 1.5 kg. Most importantly, they are implanted and securely sealed inside the wood.  We take safety very seriously, and we use independent consumer labs to make sure that everything is safe and certified before we ship it out to you. The final product will be CE-marked and compliant with the European Standard for Toys covered by EN-71 and REACH, as well as the equivalent US standards covered by ASTM F963 and CPSIA. As such, we provide you with a lifetime warranty for our products, and we will replace any broken block free of charge including shipping. You will, however, have to send us the photo of the broken block to make sure it wasn’t misused. By the way, not a single replacement was claimed yet!We are confident in our quality and can guarantee you everlasting, enjoyable play with WUMBA.  Perks.Essentially all of the above, broken down on the right, and further explained below. If you still have questions, don't hesitate to contact us. We will be shipping all rewards from Ukraine with priority airmail. All shipments will have the tracking and all shipping cost are included to the pledges. As such, the parcels should be customs-friendly for all EU, UK and US backers. However, customs fees or local sales taxes may rarely apply. Feel free to let us know if you have any specific requirements or need certain adjustments to the shipping documents. Timeline.Having successfully completed fulfillment for our previous campaign, we've learned quite a few things. We faced two bottlenecks - painting & printing and fulfillment logistics - and we took steps to address both.On the production side, the flow is now well established: - we improved the painting technology for faster and more efficient painting; - we changed the supplier of the lacquers for brighter and rich colors; - we changed the printing technology and use silk-screen printing instead of tampo-printing;The fulfillment is fully buttoned up now as well. Global shipping has a way of delivering surprises, from airport strikes to customs delays. Furthermore, the rewards after the last campaign were shipped too close to Chrismas and some of them stuck in the ""postal jams"". However, we had a chance to experience different couriers. Thus we know which will work better for us this time. Least of our worries.That being said, creating a toy is always a challenge – you must make it safe, you should make it playful and you'd better make it nice and attractive. While absolutely nothing is 100% foolproof in this world and even pigs can fly (with the proper gear, of course) we feel pretty confident that everything will be successfully managed and handled professionally.Nevertheless, we will keep you posted on every update and you can contact us at any time here and at team@wumba.toysSo here it is, this is our new lineup. We’ve spent the last 6 months working to develop sales, improving production and designing new toys. And we promise to keep going if you want us to. If you believe in what we’re doing here, please lend a hand to turn these into reality and keep us moving forward – help fund this project. From all of us here at WUMBA toys, we thank you!",16.0,25,"2 Campaigns

</div></b></div>","Luma is a smart lamp for the 21st century. Charge your device, listen to music, make a call and set the mood all with this smart lamp controlled by your phone. It is perfect for your office, nursery, bedroom and home foyer.We originally launched our product on Kickstarter and successfully raised enough money to start this product, but we decided to re-launch for three main reasons. 1) We want to raise the funds sufficient to make our lamp the first ""HomeKit"" compatible device. This will allow our product to be compatible with Siri on Apple's new OS. 2) We had multiple people still interested in backing additional lamps. Finally, 3) We had multiple people interested in buying our bulb separate from our lamp.Value PropositionBacking our project will help us deliver a smart lamp at an affordable cost. Buying these items separately would set you back over $300. Other items that combine a few of these functions, such as a dock speaker, run on average $100. Luma SmartLamp starts at $89.FeaturesLuma SmartLamp comes with three main feature categories: light, sound and power.Power (USB Charger):Luma SmartLamp is equipped with a 2.1A USB Charger. This means it can charge tablets, smart phones, and all devices that use a USB charger at the fastest possible speed.Stunning Sound (Built-in Speaker / Mic):Luma SmartLamp is equipped with a high quality built-in bluetooth speaker and microphone. This means you can play all of your phone's audio output through Luma SmartLamp. You can even take calls from the lamp. It is outfitted with a wood base and acoustic outlets to enhance your listening experience. You can link two of the Luma SmartLamp speakers together if you want a surround sound experience. This bluetooth speaker provides the best sound at it's size.Premium Speaker Specs:Wirelessly play (stream) up to 2 lamps from once source.3.5mm Auxiliary InMaximum Sound Level SPL = 86dBCFrequency Range = 130 Hz - 20 kHzDriver = One 1.5"", 4 Ohm Drivers; One 2"" x 1.25"" Passive RadiatorLight (Million Color LED):Luma SmartLamp comes equipped with a bluetooth enabled million color LED which can be controlled by your phone. The light's default color is a standard white with the brightness equivalent of a 60 watt incandescent lightbulb while only using 9 watts. These LED lights use 20x less energy than a traditional bulb and can last up to 20 years. You can use a standard white light, or enjoy a variety of colors that fit your activity or mood. You can also dim the lighting to the intensity level you desire. If you do not have your phone around, simply touch the wood base to turn on and off a white light. Phone Controlled Features:Luma SmartLamp can be controlled completely from your phone. There will be a free app download from the App store and from Google Play. This app will allow you to select a color, set the intensity and turn your lamp on/off. You will also be able to activate and deactivate different modes as described below.Music Mode: When this mode is activated, your lights will dance to the music and change colors with the rhythm. In the app you can group multiple lamps into one set to enhance this experience. This feature is demonstrated in the introduction of our video. Notifications: When this mode is activated, your light will flash when you receive a notification. With the bluetooth speaker enabled you will also hear your notification through Luma SmartLamp's speaker. Through the app you can set what notifications you want interacting with Luma SmartLamp and what the light signal will be for each alert. The notification sound will be the sound you have selected through your phone's settings. The light can interact currently with these notifications:
Gmail App
Facebook
Instagram
We are working on notifications with phone specific apps (calls, voicemail & SMS)
Proximity: When this mode is activated, your light will turn on when you are near it and it will automatically turn off when you leave it's proximity. For example, as you come home at night, your foyer lamp will be activated, when you leave the room the light will automatically turn off. As with all modes, you can turn this feature on and off.Alarm: With our app you can run your alarm through Luma SmartLamp. This mode will allow you to turn on your alarm sounds slowly over a set period of time. You can also sync it with the light, allowing you to turn on the light slowly over time. In the app you can set the speed and intensity of where the sound / light begin and end.Lamp Grouping: You can connect multiple lamps into one grouping to allow control over an entire ""room"" or grouping. Once lamps are grouped you can change their colors, intensity and modes together or separately.App: Our app will allow you to control your lamp, or a group of lamps. You will be able to enable all the above modes, select a color, dim your lighting, or turn on and off your light from within our free app. Dimensions & SpecsShort Lamp (inches): 10.25 high & just under 4.75 diameter. Tall Lamp (inches): 18.5 high & just under 4.75 diameter. Cord: The lamp ships with a twisted, cloth cord 5 feet in length.

<h3>What is the Spoaster? </h3>
<p>Simply a better coaster. They say necessity is the mother of inventions and the Spoaster's early beginnings were no different. After spilling a drink one warm summer day, I questioned why there wasn't anything on the market that even attempted to tackle this problem. What started as a quest to create a spill resistant drink coaster turned into a passion for engineering a drink coaster everyone would want to use. Along the way, I studied reasons why some people didn't own coasters while others disliked the ones they owned. Their frustration were heard and their solutions were integrated into the Spoaster's design's initial design. Over 23 iterations later, I am proud to present you the Spoaster you see in front of you today. Even if you do not currently use coasters,  consider giving the Spoaster a try. I guarantee you will never go back to life without one!</p>

<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>Due to color order minimums, I only had sufficient funds for 2 colors (blue and red) on the initial launch earlier this month. I am looking to raise funds for an additional 2 colors so that each Spoaster set will have 4 unique colors. This gives the added benefit of being able to keep track of one another's drinks. (how often have we gotten drinks mixed up at a party?) Please pledge to my campaign today and each set will contain a limited edition Indiegogo Magenta Spoaster. </p>
</div><div>
<p>I truly believe that the Spoaster is something which anyone can benefit from using. There is no other product which offers you what the Spoaster does and I really hope you consider getting a set. </p>

<h3>A low risk project to you</h3>
<p>As the Spoaster is currently in production (albeit with just 2 colors) I have reduced the risk for you to a bare minimum. The tooling is in place as I have invested all the upfront capital needed to get the Spoaster up and running, I just need a little extra oomph to help cross that finish line! </p>
<p>In a worse case scenario, the timeline may get slightly pushed out if there is an extreme volume of orders. However, I promise to keep all backers and interested parties up to date with progress from Pledge to Delivery along with answering any questions you might have. </p>
<h3>About me</h3>
<p>My name is Sherwin and I graduated from UCSD with an Aerospace engineering degree (no, I never worked for NASA). Though I have never worked in the aerospace industry, I held various engineering jobs and currently work as a mechanical engineer. In my spare time I enjoy playing HOTS, board games and beach volleyball. </p>
<p>My wife and I will be welcoming our first baby (Chexican girl!) this coming summer (2nd baby if you count the Spoaster as the 1st, somewhere I hear a shoe hurtling towards the back of my head). Personally, I have a lot riding on this but I believe in the Spoaster and its effectiveness so I really hope I can turn it into a household name. </p>

</div></div>","What is the Spoaster? 
Simply a better coaster. They say necessity is the mother of inventions and the Spoaster's early beginnings were no different. After spilling a drink one warm summer day, I questioned why there wasn't anything on the market that even attempted to tackle this problem. What started as a quest to create a spill resistant drink coaster turned into a passion for engineering a drink coaster everyone would want to use. Along the way, I studied reasons why some people didn't own coasters while others disliked the ones they owned. Their frustration were heard and their solutions were integrated into the Spoaster's design's initial design. Over 23 iterations later, I am proud to present you the Spoaster you see in front of you today. Even if you do not currently use coasters,  consider giving the Spoaster a try. I guarantee you will never go back to life without one!
Spoaster Features
Tip Resistant design prevents accidental spills!

No more annoying drips from condensation thanks to the Spoaster absorbent sponge insert. 

Patent pending design results from 2 years of testing and refinement

Arms help guide drink into Spoaster while allowing for easy one-handed carrying

Stackable design saves space between uses 

One size fits most glasses, cans, bottles, coffee mugs and more


How you can help
Due to color order minimums, I only had sufficient funds for 2 colors (blue and red) on the initial launch earlier this month. I am looking to raise funds for an additional 2 colors so that each Spoaster set will have 4 unique colors. This gives the added benefit of being able to keep track of one another's drinks. (how often have we gotten drinks mixed up at a party?) Please pledge to my campaign today and each set will contain a limited edition Indiegogo Magenta Spoaster. 

I truly believe that the Spoaster is something which anyone can benefit from using. There is no other product which offers you what the Spoaster does and I really hope you consider getting a set. 
The fun stuff - PERKS!
Spoaster set - Includes 4 Spoasters (one of which is Indiegogo Magenta) and 4 absorbent sponge inserts
Spoaster replacement sponge inserts - Pack of 5 - Bonus Included with all double sets and up!

But not just any type of rest. Good rest. Productive rest. We value work efficiency so much but don't seem to say the same for how we sleep.ZEREMA is the ultimate sleep solution for those tired of never getting that productive rest. This pillow incorporates deep-learning AI to learn your sleep habits, automatically put you in a more comfortable sleeping position, and provide a personalized analysis on how you can sleep better. But with all this amazing tech underneath, ZEREMA still does its main job. Its soft open-cell marshmallow memory foam keeps your head comfortable and supported as a pillow should.      With ZEREMA, you can make it your own. No need to Goldilocks your way through countless pillows. All you need to do is set the air cushion to the height of your liking on the ZEREMA app.This adjustable feature also works automatically with our AI-powered snore detecting technology. When snoring is detected, ZEREMA will raise or lower the pillow height on its own to open up your airway. It does so so gently that it won't disturb your sleep.   Watch The Air Cushions Work!    When these two air cushions work together, they ensure they feel just right on your head and neck. Like a tailored suit, a pillow should not be one size fits all. With so many different variations in our height, weight, and spinal alignment, it's hard to believe a single pillow works for everyone. Comfort is relative and should not be generalized.According to research conducted by the Harvard Medical School, how your head rests on your pillow plays a crucial role in your spine health. Matthew O'Rourke, a physical therapist at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, explains that extended periods of misalignment can result in serious damage to your neck.      Having bad posture while working, studying, and watching Netflix damages your neck’s natural c-curve. There's even more damage when your pillow doesn’t support you properly in your sleep, causing excessive pain and tension in the neck.      ZEREMA, on the other hand, supports your cervical vertebral by working the air cushions. When you find the right height and angle for your neck, it will minimize the number of times you toss and turn for a comfortable position.    ZEREMA detects snoring by inflating the air cushions inside the pillow. Snoring is the noisy result of a person's airway being obstructed. So when snoring is detected, the air cushions work to lift the neck and re-open that airway. This is the same principle as performing CPR. In order to allow proper breathing, the first step procedure is to tilt the head back and lift the chin up.But for ZEREMA, this happens while you're asleep.  ZEREMA's app integrates deep-learning which takes data learned from over 10,000 sounds including snoring to more accurately detect new unique snoring sounds. It also teaches itself to distinguish snoring apart from other sounds, ensuring the air cushion adjustment is only activated when a distinct snore is heard.  ZEREMA's Snoring Detecting Skill.  We conducted a test to see how accurately ZEREMA detects snores. The results show it detected snoring in just 10-30 seconds and lifted up the pillow height right away. As the pillow height adjusted, it helped the user breathe better and decreased much of his snoring. 

 
When put to the test against other anti-snore pillows, ZEREMA was proven to more accurately distinguish and activate only when an actual snore was detected.
 
 
A Sleep Clinic Is In Your Hand.
    ZEREMA's intelligence derives from its mobile app. It acts as a real-time sleep monitor to track and provide insight on your sleeping habits. When you set up the app before going to bed, it monitors your sleep while you're asleep. When you wake up, the app shows your sleep index, sleep duration, snore duration, and provides a customized sleep report on a daily, weekly, monthly, and even yearly basis. The sleep report keeps you updated with your latest sleep data.With ZEREMA, you can manage your sleep systematically. You can even set your own sleep goal and find out how to improve your sleep. Like a little sleep clinic in your hand!  ZEREMA is made with open-cell memory foam which promotes free-flowing ventilation. The micro-holes that give it the “open-cell” name allow air to slip in and out easily and stay more hygienic than most conventional closed-cell memory foam pillows.This material is also softer to the touch. It almost feels like lying on a marshmallow - supportive yet giving.   ZEREMA’s rectangular shape keeps your head comfortably positioned and evenly distributes the head weight. When designing ZEREMA, we closely examined the natural structure of a human head and came up with a pillow that complements this curve.ZEREMA also keeps side sleepers comfortably positioned. The left and right side of the pillow are raised slightly higher than the middle and have small ear rests that provide ultimate neck and head support for side sleepers.  Compared to the average pillow, ZEREMA’s structure provides superior head support. We conducted two experiments to test how well ZEREMA senses and distributes pressure. The results show the cracker remains perfectly intact and the sensor's measurements indicate the far even distribution of head weight.   ZEREMA Includes Special Covers.    To wash the pillow cover, put it into a washer, or wash it by hand. We don’t recommend using a dryer as the pillow cover may shrink. If needed, tumble dry without heat.  Do NOT wash the inner cover. Instead, gently wipe with a wet tissue.    01.  Adjust the pillow height to align your posture in your natural c-curve02.  Enjoy the soft comfort of open-cell memory foam and clean antibacterial cover   03.  App detects snoring04.  Air pump gently auto-adjusts your pillow height to open up your airways    05.  Read your real-time sleep analysis report06.  Wake up to customized alarms07.  Receive tips and advice on how to improve your sleep      How many people in the world use pillows every night?

This eco-friendly air humidifier is made of compressed fibres and effectively eases dryness of your room with the help of capillary phenomenon. Water evaporation through capillary phenomenon on a set of KASUMI achieves just around 50% of humidity in a few hours and maintains this level, so your room will not be over-humidified. No more worries about damaging your paper documents or valuable items near the humidifier!</p><p>A set of KASUMI evaporates water up to 30 times faster than the European winter tradition of keeping a small cup of water above the central heating.</p><p><strong>Humidifiers are only for wintertime, no?</strong><br/><br/>Did you know that it is actually early spring that the indoor humidity gets the driest?</p><p>In more than 10 different regions across the world: from Northern and Central Europe to North America and Japan, the indoor humidity without any humidification methods only achieves the range of 10-35% from November onwards with March recording its lowest level, according to the <a href=""https://researchinestonia.eu/2020/04/07/why-is-indoor-air-too-dry-in-winter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Research</a> in Estonia.</p><p>All perks shall be shipped out from late January to mid February via air mail, so you can receive it before the indoor humidity hits the lowest!</p><p>Even in summertime in humid regions (e.g. Japan with over 90% humidity outdoors), the indoor humidity still easily gets dry when air conditioners are in use.</p><p>In fact, usage of humidifiers is very common in Japanese offices and hospitals throughout the year. Japanese society sees the importance of humidifiers in every season: spring against hay fever; summer against dry eyes from AC, and autumn and winter against the spread of cold and flu (now Covid-19 included).</p><p><strong>Why is the air humidity around 50% so important?</strong></p><p>Humidity actually matters.  Here is a quick video guidance for you!</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWTsF5etDJw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div><i>[transcription]<br/>When the air is too dry, you will be more susceptive to viruses in many aspects. It is not only Covid-19, but also other infectious viruses.</i></div><div><i>Transmission: In the range of 40-60% humidity, infectious droplets of the viruses fall onto the ground faster, reducing the duration of other people to breathe in the infectious droplets.</i></div><div><i>Access to your blood line: You all probably have experienced small tears and bleeding on your hands or feet during wintertime. In dry cold environment, your skin gets dried and eventually gets torn. These tears allow bacteria and viruses the easiest access to your blood line!</i></div><p><i>Your frontline immunity: Mucous membranes in your nose prevents bacteria and viruses to come further into your body. On a cell level, there are tiny hair-like organelles called cilia, which stand up to block the bacteria and viruses from passing through. In lower humidity, they cannot function effectively.</i></p><p><i>Remember, over-humidification is not good. Above 60% humidity will create the favourable environment for household moulds to grow. Covid-19 will also stay active longer on object surfaces in the environment above 65% humidity.

That’s why KASUMI comes in the unit of 3 sets for sale!</p><p><strong>Fundraising and your rewards</strong></p><p>Perhaps you wondered why I’m pledging a fundraise here, having the luxury of living in a skyscraper penthouse overlooking the spectacular Manhattan landscape? Because I DON’T!<br/>I did the visual and writing for this IndieGoGo campaign solely by myself over the “Stay Home” lonely Christmas 2020 inside my small bedroom in a locked down city of Tallinn.</p><p>Since I am asking for your financial support, I do not think it is justifiable to spend any unnecessary costs, such as making a fancy intro video involving filming crew and actors. I only spent €2 for the visual work. And because we are in the second lockdown in where I live, I also decided to do this all on my own in my little bedroom, observing the concept of “Stay Home” absolutely faithfully!

If you want more than a set of KASUMI, don’t miss out the early bird special packages which are valid until 23:59 GMT time on 30th January!</p><p>The compressed fibre used for making KASUMI are partially from recycle fabrics. This is more recognisable on the white swan. Please keep in mind that the white swans may contain a couple of tiny coloured fibres on their bodies, as we don’t use chemical bleach for completely whitening them.</p><p><i><strong>If you have watched the explainer video, you can basically skip the rest and scroll down until you no longer see any photos to the “Risks and Challenges”.</strong></i></p><p><strong>How to use KASUMI?</strong></p><p>1.

Stand KASUMI in up to 1cm of 5% acidic vinegar water. For example, you can keep KASUMI in the vinegar water just above the central heating.</p><p>3. KASUMI will keep your room humidified and become even cuter with snow-like cellulose crystals on the edges.</p><p>4. Wash or disinfect KASUMI and dry them completely at least once a week.</p><p>*If you are uncomfortable with the smell of the vinegar, infuse vinegar with your favourite fragrant essence or make citrus peel vinegar. Attention: Citrus peels are the best to mask the vinegar smell, however, the colour of the citrus fruit stains on KASUMI.</p><p><strong>How to take care of KASUMI?</strong></p><p>For hygienic usage, it is recommended to wash or disinfect KASUMI and the water container once a week and dry them completely.</p><p>Washing: It is best to handwash KASUMI in a small container of water around your body temperature or less with a few drops of laundry or kitchen detergent. Soak KASUMI for about 30 minutes, gently move them around inside the soapy water, drain, and then do this with just water for 2 more rounds. Then dry on a flat surface.</p><p>Not suitable for washing in the washing machine. If ironing, select “synthetic” or less than 100 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Disinfection: The disinfecting solution containing hypochlorite is not suitable for KASUMI. Hypochlorite will result in bleaching the colour of KASUMI.</p><p><strong>Is KASUMI better than electronic humidifiers?</strong></p><p>In comparison with electronic humidifier, KASUMI is the better option in many aspects.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609788248/ddune31cdvoa4ewm1mep.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Values: No electricity required, eco-friendly, and cheaper than the electronic ones!</p><p>Noise: KASUMI makes no sound. Your sleep will never be disturbed by KASUMI.</p><p>Comfort: KASUMI does not spray out the water. You don’t have to worry anymore about getting splashes onto your face or your valuable items with KASUMI in your life!</p><p>Optimal: KASUMI maintains around 50% of humidity and will never over-humidifies your house. (Above 60% of humidity should be avoided as it allows household moulds and extended active life of Covid-19 on object surfaces.)</p><p>Easy to care: KASUMI only requires a gentle hand wash once a week. Electronic humidifiers require more frequent and vigorous cleaning, yet the mineral buildup clots the water path, which tends to result in costly replacements every few years, especially in hard water regions.</p><p>Clean: KASUMI and your plate are both easily washable, hence the best option to maintain hygiene environment in your house. With electronic humidifiers, the water path in the machine can easily become the colony for bacteria and moulds, spreading out the hazardous aerosol to the room.</p><p><strong>Are KASUMI reusable every year?</strong></p><p>You may already know that the existing Japanese paper and fabric humidifiers in the market have quite a short life of only 1-3 months on average. It is because of the material’s limited durability, but more for the concern of growing bacteria and moulds on the material.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609788099/bq4dnn7cgwdqxbcmhsnu.jpg"" src=""""/>KASUMI is made of compressed fibre durable with 5% acidic vinegar water and hand-washing. This is how we can achieve protecting KASUMI and the water from household bacteria and moulds, resulting in longer product life.</p><p>The minerals in the tapped water will eventually clog the capillary paths and slow down the air humidifying effect of KASUMI. It depends on the hardness of your water, but it is recommended to replace KASUMI with a new set every 2-3 years.</p><p><strong>The science behind KASUMI</strong></p><p>The concept of KASUMI is very simple: stand, water and let it just be. But it is carefully crafted with some personal insights in physics and chemistry.</p><p>The natural water evaporation with the help of capillary phenomenon cannot over-humidify the air, as the evaporation slows down when the indoor air reaches 55% humidity.</p><p>Despite the simplicity, the self-standing structure in these adorable designs are unique and new for humidifiers, according to the global industrial design database. The length and angle of the slits are calibrated for stabilising the posture of this self-standing humidifier, and the air holes in the shape of snowflakes, stars and hearts enhance water evaporation.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609787897/lztima540pj56z01x4tq.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/><br/>registered for industrial designs</p><p>The use of 5% acidic vinegar water prevents household moulds and bacteria from growing in the water and on KASUMI, while producing snow-like crystals on the edges as the acetobacter xylinum in the air connects with vinegar and synthesises cellulose.</p><p><strong>Why do KASUMI get white crystals?</strong></p><p>We use 5% acidic vinegar water for protecting KASUMI and the water from harmful bacteria and mould in the house. As long as KASUMI are soaked in the 5% acidic water, there is almost no chance for common household bacteria or moulds to grow.</p><p>But there is one non-harmful genera in the air which likes vinegar: acetobacter xylinum of the acetic acid bacteria. These are the same bacteria that we use for making vinegar. KASUMI will get snow-like crystals on the edges as the acetobacter xylinum connects with vinegar and synthesises cellulose. If you make a citrus peel vinegar, you will see a shade of the citrus colour in the cellulose crystals. The cellulose is completely safe to touch.

Upon expiry of my 1-year visa, life is now getting even more difficult for me as the immigration policy has been tightened due to the ongoing situation of Covid-19 and its economical effect in the region. The visa and residence permit for non-EU people are granted only when the study or job absolutely requires one’s physical existence in Estonia. I came to Estonia just before the outbreak of Covid-19, I learned Estonian language rather quickly since the lockdown, and yet I cannot operate my cultural workshop business as planned, I still want to live here and I’ve been sustaining my life from my own savings without any financial aid from any governments. But I am not allowed to stay here anymore if I am not absolutely needed to physically be in Estonia.</p><p>So I came up with the idea of launching 2 local businesses in Tallinn which cannot be operated remotely: (1) making and sales of KASUMI from Estonia to the world, and (2) cooking and sales of Japanese food in Tallinn.

<p><strong>KASUMI from Lady Wait-Rose</strong></p>
<p>Ever since I moved to Estonia in November 2019, I started to wake up with a sore throat because of the European dry climate. The right level of air humidity is important for our immune system, so I considered installing an air humidifier in my flat in the first autumn of Covid-19 era, but the existing humidifiers in the European market were all too expensive. Nothing was cheap like the Japanese paper humidifiers, which are usually sold around 7 Euros for 1 month. That is why I started experimenting to make my own humidifier, and I‘ve put together everything I wanted  in a humidifier: quiet, no splashes, and hygienic. And I also wanted to give it a role like a teddy bear, with whom I can cope through the lonely nights. To keep the water evaporation going, we need to water KASUMI from day to day. It’s like growing a plant or living with a pet. You can see the snow-like cellulose crystals to grow on KASUMI, and you check everyday if your KASUMI have enough vinegar water to evaporate. Having some routines and something to care about in our daily life is very important for our mind, now that we are going through this extended period of unusual reality with no place to escape in the world. That’s how the idea of KASUMI came into my life, and now it has become my means of survival for securing my legal residency in Estonia.</p>
<p>When I showed my prototypes in Estonia, many people asked how I got all these scientific knowledge whereas I am formerly known to be a legal professional. It is purely because law was not the most interesting and enjoyable subject for me to study or work with. Other than cultural and creative activities or English language education, I had more interests in medical field and self-studied quite a lot to the extent that I got appointed to tutor Japanese medical students for USMLE exam and to serve as a medical interpreter in the field of neuropsychology back in Tokyo.</p>
<p>And this is why I care about staying healthy, both in physical and psychological senses, especially while we all are going through this difficult time with Covid-19. KASUMI is not just about being cute/kawaii. If it were just like the other existing air humidifiers, I wouldn’t have chosen to create them for sale. It had to be hygienic, environmental, and effective for keeping our life comfortable. It’s more about introducing a healthy lifestyle while we all stay home and there is nowhere to escape to .</p>
<p>Yes, we have been physically separated from other folks, but no one is alone in this crisis. Together, we get through this! KASUMI is intended to support your healthy lifestyle in the area social distancing cannot help. That’s why I decided to sell my KASUMI to the world, online!</p>

<p>Please spread the word and let people know about my new invention!<br/>If there is any demand, I am available for media coverage in English, Japanese, or possibly in Estonian language.</p>

No more worries about damaging your paper documents or valuable items near the humidifier!A set of KASUMI evaporates water up to 30 times faster than the European winter tradition of keeping a small cup of water above the central heating.Humidifiers are only for wintertime, no?Did you know that it is actually early spring that the indoor humidity gets the driest?In more than 10 different regions across the world: from Northern and Central Europe to North America and Japan, the indoor humidity without any humidification methods only achieves the range of 10-35% from November onwards with March recording its lowest level, according to the Research in Estonia.All perks shall be shipped out from late January to mid February via air mail, so you can receive it before the indoor humidity hits the lowest!Even in summertime in humid regions (e.g. Japan with over 90% humidity outdoors), the indoor humidity still easily gets dry when air conditioners are in use.In fact, usage of humidifiers is very common in Japanese offices and hospitals throughout the year. Japanese society sees the importance of humidifiers in every season: spring against hay fever; summer against dry eyes from AC, and autumn and winter against the spread of cold and flu (now Covid-19 included).Why is the air humidity around 50% so important?Humidity actually matters.  Here is a quick video guidance for you![transcription]When the air is too dry, you will be more susceptive to viruses in many aspects. It is not only Covid-19, but also other infectious viruses.Transmission: In the range of 40-60% humidity, infectious droplets of the viruses fall onto the ground faster, reducing the duration of other people to breathe in the infectious droplets.Access to your blood line: You all probably have experienced small tears and bleeding on your hands or feet during wintertime. In dry cold environment, your skin gets dried and eventually gets torn. These tears allow bacteria and viruses the easiest access to your blood line!Your frontline immunity: Mucous membranes in your nose prevents bacteria and viruses to come further into your body. On a cell level, there are tiny hair-like organelles called cilia, which stand up to block the bacteria and viruses from passing through. In lower humidity, they cannot function effectively.Remember, over-humidification is not good. Above 60% humidity will create the favourable environment for household moulds to grow. Covid-19 will also stay active longer on object surfaces in the environment above 65% humidity. This creates another layer of danger for an extended period of time, which we cannot avoid by social distancing. In the absence of hydrometre, electric humidifiers tends to over-humidify the room.KASUMI maintains around 50% of humidity and will never over-humidifies your house because the natural water evaporation slows down when the air reaches 55% humidity.If you are more curious on this topic, you can continue with these reading materials: quick / detailedHow many KASUMI do I need?The speed of water evaporation through KASUMI depends on the temperature and default humidity level of its surrounding environment. Usually, one KASUMI per 5 square metres is optimal for keeping your rooms moist for at least 24 hours.For instance, a double bed room is 15 square metres on average. That’s why KASUMI comes in the unit of 3 sets for sale!Fundraising and your rewardsPerhaps you wondered why I’m pledging a fundraise here, having the luxury of living in a skyscraper penthouse overlooking the spectacular Manhattan landscape? Because I DON’T!I did the visual and writing for this IndieGoGo campaign solely by myself over the “Stay Home” lonely Christmas 2020 inside my small bedroom in a locked down city of Tallinn.Since I am asking for your financial support, I do not think it is justifiable to spend any unnecessary costs, such as making a fancy intro video involving filming crew and actors. I only spent €2 for the visual work. And because we are in the second lockdown in where I live, I also decided to do this all on my own in my little bedroom, observing the concept of “Stay Home” absolutely faithfully! The voiceover is my real voice, but those models are from free videos on Canva ;)For your hearty contribution which can start from just less than a dollar, you will all get a reward: an exclusive access to the “behind the scenes” digital photo book via e-mail!KASUMI sets are available from £14/€15/$18 (approximately). If you want more than a set of KASUMI, don’t miss out the early bird special packages which are valid until 23:59 GMT time on 30th January!The compressed fibre used for making KASUMI are partially from recycle fabrics. This is more recognisable on the white swan. Please keep in mind that the white swans may contain a couple of tiny coloured fibres on their bodies, as we don’t use chemical bleach for completely whitening them.If you have watched the explainer video, you can basically skip the rest and scroll down until you no longer see any photos to the “Risks and Challenges”.How to use KASUMI?1. Slide the slits together and wet KASUMI with 5% acidic vinegar water*2. Stand KASUMI in up to 1cm of 5% acidic vinegar water. For example, you can keep KASUMI in the vinegar water just above the central heating.3. KASUMI will keep your room humidified and become even cuter with snow-like cellulose crystals on the edges.4. Wash or disinfect KASUMI and dry them completely at least once a week.*If you are uncomfortable with the smell of the vinegar, infuse vinegar with your favourite fragrant essence or make citrus peel vinegar. Attention: Citrus peels are the best to mask the vinegar smell, however, the colour of the citrus fruit stains on KASUMI.How to take care of KASUMI?For hygienic usage, it is recommended to wash or disinfect KASUMI and the water container once a week and dry them completely.Washing: It is best to handwash KASUMI in a small container of water around your body temperature or less with a few drops of laundry or kitchen detergent. Soak KASUMI for about 30 minutes, gently move them around inside the soapy water, drain, and then do this with just water for 2 more rounds. Then dry on a flat surface.Not suitable for washing in the washing machine. If ironing, select “synthetic” or less than 100 degrees Celsius.Disinfection: The disinfecting solution containing hypochlorite is not suitable for KASUMI. Hypochlorite will result in bleaching the colour of KASUMI.Is KASUMI better than electronic humidifiers?In comparison with electronic humidifier, KASUMI is the better option in many aspects.Values: No electricity required, eco-friendly, and cheaper than the electronic ones!Noise: KASUMI makes no sound. Your sleep will never be disturbed by KASUMI.Comfort: KASUMI does not spray out the water. You don’t have to worry anymore about getting splashes onto your face or your valuable items with KASUMI in your life!Optimal: KASUMI maintains around 50% of humidity and will never over-humidifies your house. (Above 60% of humidity should be avoided as it allows household moulds and extended active life of Covid-19 on object surfaces.)Easy to care: KASUMI only requires a gentle hand wash once a week. Electronic humidifiers require more frequent and vigorous cleaning, yet the mineral buildup clots the water path, which tends to result in costly replacements every few years, especially in hard water regions.Clean: KASUMI and your plate are both easily washable, hence the best option to maintain hygiene environment in your house. With electronic humidifiers, the water path in the machine can easily become the colony for bacteria and moulds, spreading out the hazardous aerosol to the room.Are KASUMI reusable every year?You may already know that the existing Japanese paper and fabric humidifiers in the market have quite a short life of only 1-3 months on average. It is because of the material’s limited durability, but more for the concern of growing bacteria and moulds on the material.KASUMI is made of compressed fibre durable with 5% acidic vinegar water and hand-washing. This is how we can achieve protecting KASUMI and the water from household bacteria and moulds, resulting in longer product life.The minerals in the tapped water will eventually clog the capillary paths and slow down the air humidifying effect of KASUMI. It depends on the hardness of your water, but it is recommended to replace KASUMI with a new set every 2-3 years.The science behind KASUMIThe concept of KASUMI is very simple: stand, water and let it just be. But it is carefully crafted with some personal insights in physics and chemistry.The natural water evaporation with the help of capillary phenomenon cannot over-humidify the air, as the evaporation slows down when the indoor air reaches 55% humidity.Despite the simplicity, the self-standing structure in these adorable designs are unique and new for humidifiers, according to the global industrial design database. The length and angle of the slits are calibrated for stabilising the posture of this self-standing humidifier, and the air holes in the shape of snowflakes, stars and hearts enhance water evaporation.registered for industrial designsThe use of 5% acidic vinegar water prevents household moulds and bacteria from growing in the water and on KASUMI, while producing snow-like crystals on the edges as the acetobacter xylinum in the air connects with vinegar and synthesises cellulose.Why do KASUMI get white crystals?We use 5% acidic vinegar water for protecting KASUMI and the water from harmful bacteria and mould in the house. As long as KASUMI are soaked in the 5% acidic water, there is almost no chance for common household bacteria or moulds to grow.But there is one non-harmful genera in the air which likes vinegar: acetobacter xylinum of the acetic acid bacteria. These are the same bacteria that we use for making vinegar. KASUMI will get snow-like crystals on the edges as the acetobacter xylinum connects with vinegar and synthesises cellulose. If you make a citrus peel vinegar, you will see a shade of the citrus colour in the cellulose crystals. The cellulose is completely safe to touch. If you don’t like seeing them, you can simply wash them away.Risks and challengesNew and stricter restrictions on movement and transportation due to Covid-19 may affect shipping schedule.On a personal level, launching KASUMI is actually my means of survival for my legal stay in Estonia in order to comply with the stricter immigration policy in Estonia and Schengen countries.Most of my one year of sabbatical was spent alone in my flat in Tallinn due to Covid-19 crisis and difficult time for Asian faces in the world out there. Upon expiry of my 1-year visa, life is now getting even more difficult for me as the immigration policy has been tightened due to the ongoing situation of Covid-19 and its economical effect in the region. The visa and residence permit for non-EU people are granted only when the study or job absolutely requires one’s physical existence in Estonia. I came to Estonia just before the outbreak of Covid-19, I learned Estonian language rather quickly since the lockdown, and yet I cannot operate my cultural workshop business as planned, I still want to live here and I’ve been sustaining my life from my own savings without any financial aid from any governments. But I am not allowed to stay here anymore if I am not absolutely needed to physically be in Estonia.So I came up with the idea of launching 2 local businesses in Tallinn which cannot be operated remotely: (1) making and sales of KASUMI from Estonia to the world, and (2) cooking and sales of Japanese food in Tallinn. If you are curious, you can see more of what I do on my business website!
KASUMI from Lady Wait-Rose
Ever since I moved to Estonia in November 2019, I started to wake up with a sore throat because of the European dry climate. The right level of air humidity is important for our immune system, so I considered installing an air humidifier in my flat in the first autumn of Covid-19 era, but the existing humidifiers in the European market were all too expensive. Nothing was cheap like the Japanese paper humidifiers, which are usually sold around 7 Euros for 1 month. That is why I started experimenting to make my own humidifier, and I‘ve put together everything I wanted  in a humidifier: quiet, no splashes, and hygienic. And I also wanted to give it a role like a teddy bear, with whom I can cope through the lonely nights. To keep the water evaporation going, we need to water KASUMI from day to day. It’s like growing a plant or living with a pet. You can see the snow-like cellulose crystals to grow on KASUMI, and you check everyday if your KASUMI have enough vinegar water to evaporate. Having some routines and something to care about in our daily life is very important for our mind, now that we are going through this extended period of unusual reality with no place to escape in the world. That’s how the idea of KASUMI came into my life, and now it has become my means of survival for securing my legal residency in Estonia.
When I showed my prototypes in Estonia, many people asked how I got all these scientific knowledge whereas I am formerly known to be a legal professional. It is purely because law was not the most interesting and enjoyable subject for me to study or work with. Other than cultural and creative activities or English language education, I had more interests in medical field and self-studied quite a lot to the extent that I got appointed to tutor Japanese medical students for USMLE exam and to serve as a medical interpreter in the field of neuropsychology back in Tokyo.
And this is why I care about staying healthy, both in physical and psychological senses, especially while we all are going through this difficult time with Covid-19. KASUMI is not just about being cute/kawaii. If it were just like the other existing air humidifiers, I wouldn’t have chosen to create them for sale. It had to be hygienic, environmental, and effective for keeping our life comfortable. It’s more about introducing a healthy lifestyle while we all stay home and there is nowhere to escape to .
Yes, we have been physically separated from other folks, but no one is alone in this crisis. Together, we get through this! KASUMI is intended to support your healthy lifestyle in the area social distancing cannot help. That’s why I decided to sell my KASUMI to the world, online!
Other ways you can help
Please spread the word and let people know about my new invention!If there is any demand, I am available for media coverage in English, Japanese, or possibly in Estonian language.
When I proceed to bulk production of KASUMI with your help, I can also continue making and selling KASUMI on my own website after this campaign.

<p align=""justify""><b>Q. Do I need to change my switch to operate the bulb?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">No change required.  Just replace your existing bulb with SmartCharge bulb.<br/></p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Q. Will the bulb work in light fixtures which have one switch controlling many bulbs?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Yes. SmartCharge 2.0 works with multi bulb fixtures controlled by single switch.</p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Q. Is it OK if I replace only one of the many bulbs with a SmartCharge bulb in a multi-bulb fixture?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Yes. As long as the other bulbs in that fixture are LED or other energy efficient bulbs you can replace 1, 2 or as many you like with SmartCharge V2.0 LED bulbs.</p>
<p align=""justify"">It will not work with incandescent bulbs.</p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Q. What is the life of the Bulb?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">This is a LED bulb with rated life of more than 20 years. Battery is Li-Ion rechargeable battery - approximately 300 - 400 cycles of charging so about 3 years of life before need to be replaced.</p>
<p align=""justify""></p>
<p><b>Q. How often do I have to replace the built-in battery?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Inside the bulb is a Li Ion rechargeable battery with about 300 charging cycles. This battery may need to be replaced every 3-4 years, depending on use.</p>
<p align=""justify""></p>
<p><b>Q. How often do I charge the
battery?</b></p>
<p>After
using the bulb during power outage it is recommended to charge it for up to 4-6
hours depending on how long the bulb was used during outage. The bulb charges on
AC power during normal operation when turned ON. So using the bulb a minimum of
2 hours every week is recommended. Alternatively, you can use charge only mode
for charging the battery. </p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Q. Can the bulb be used in closed fixtures?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">No, it cannot be used in closed fixtures.  UL testing and standards have very strict requirements around safety of the products.  The heat generated if not dissipated may result in a hazardous situation.  Enclosed fixtures do not allow proper ventilation for the heat sink.  That is why, for safety reasons (overheating), this bulb is not recommended to be used in enclosed fixtures.<br/></p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Q. Is
just unplugging the lamp the same as simulating a power outage?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">No, it is not.  The reason
is SmartCharge™ bulbs need a load (complete circuit) behind the switch to
operate. In a general home situation, there are a number of loads (e.g appliances) behind the
switch when the power is turned off therefore they complete the circuit for the SmartCharge™ bulb when it
is plugged in.  If the circuit is not completed the SmartCharge bulb
cannot distinguish between a power outage and the switch being turned off so
the bulb would not stay on.</p>

<p align=""justify""><b>Q. How do I Simulate a Power Outage?</b></p>
<p><i>Note: Make sure the Smart Charge Bulb is sufficiently charged before simulating the power outage.</i></p>

We are partnering with Distributors in different countries. We have distributors in India and Mexico.  You can pre order and support us here in US and we will ship the rewards to an address of your loved ones in India or Mexico.  Avoid overseas shipping cost.SmartCharge
is the world’s first ultra-energy efficient LED light bulb that works like a
normal light bulb even during a power outage. It is integrated with a
rechargeable lithium ion battery and patented switch sensor technology. The user
can turn it ON/OFF from the same wall switch even during a power outage. SmartCharge doesn’t require any hardware changes or rewiring—it fits
right into standard light sockets. It works on a wide range of supply voltages,
thus it is applicable to every country in the world.  Its
built-in backup battery provides 4 hours of light. These 4 hours of charge can
be ""extended"" by turning the bulb off if there’s no need for light at
the moment. When the power comes back, SmartCharge automatically recharges the
battery.
Simply Replace Your Old Bulbs

Simply replace any existing light bulb with a SmartCharge™ LED Bulb. 
There is no extra wiring, no ugly control box, no remote control or WiFi  or expensive electrical installation required.
Never notice a power outage - Like nothing happened

With SmartCharge™ Bulbs, you won’t even notice a power outage because the SmartCharge™ Bulb will continue to provide you with light. Turn On/Off your SmartCharge™ Bulbs by using the same light switch – it’s like a power outage never happened.
Endless Use – Anywhere – Everywhere

When the power goes out, the whole house goes dark except for rooms using SmartCharge™ Bulbs, which stay on, or are ready to be turned on in another room if needed.


""Peace of Mind"" for Everyone


No need to use candles or oil burners risking safety of kids. SmartCharge is a non polluting and safe solution to darkness due to power outage.
""No hassle"" during power outages


No need to look for a flashlight, candles, or emergency lamp.  You do what you do normally – just turn on the switch and the light comes ON. 

Energy Efficient – Environment Friendly - Long Lasting
The SmartCharge™ Bulb helps cut electricity usage for lighting by up to 85%, saving you money and reducing the impact on the environment.

SmartCharge™ Bulbs are also long lasting, rated up to 40,000 hours or 25 years of life.
Turn ON/OFF From The Same Switch Even During Power Outage""
The heart of the SmartCharge™ LED Bulb is our patented Grid & Switch Sensor technology. It is capable of distinguishing between a loss of power due to opening of the line switch and a loss of power resulting from a grid failure when the line switch is either open or close.


 From the outside it looks like a normal LED light bulb. But we have added a battery, intelligent control technology and an inverter all inside the light bulb assembly to make it smart and efficient.
Grid & Switch Sensor technology consists of three blocks:
1. Intelligent control circuit with grid sense and switch sense
2. Battery and battery charging circuit
3. Inverter along with few other elements



The resulting smart LED bulb is immune to grid power outages. It always knows, even during a power failure, the wall switch position and turns the bulb ON or OFF based on the switch position. 
If switch was ON when power failed, then the SmartCharge™ Bulb will remain ON.
If switch was OFF, the SmartCharge™ Bulb will remain OFF.
During a power outage, the switch still has control of the light bulb.


Additionally, unlike other safety light bulbs that automatically switch on when the power goes out - regardless if you are in the room - the SmartCharge™ Bulb recognizes the light switch’s position to conserve its power and only draws from the battery when needed. Once power is restored, the bulb’s battery recharges itself to make sure you’re ready for another power outage or emergency.

<p>We're huge proponents of rapid prototyping and getting real world feedback. Over the last 2 years, we iterated through <strong>9 generations</strong> of Ohmni, allowing us to tailor the design to meet our user’s needs. In the last 6 months, we have built and shipped <strong>76 units</strong> as far as <strong>France, Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam</strong>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we're <strong>manufacturing in-house</strong>, in Silicon Valley, USA, for the following key reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increased control over entire process and quality.</li>
<li>Continuous improvement by applying Lean Manufacturing principles.</li>
<li>Independence from overseas contract manufacturer schedules, delays, and large up-front costs.</li>
<li>Optimal choices of BOM, suppliers and part alternatives for reduced lead-time and inventory management.</li>
<li>Pull production with Kanban to achieve just-in-time manufacturing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although it was not an easy path, we achieved our vision of making a hardware company that iterates quickly and strives for continual improvement. We, in turn, expect to have less execution risk and reduced costs that we can pass on to our backers.</p>

If your country is not shown on this list but resides in the same region, it will likely have the same rates.</p><p>These are reference rates quoted by our shipper. We’ve experts working on reducing these costs right now and will likely get better rates as more orders come in. We’re only collecting shipping costs after the campaign ends so you’re guaranteed to pay only the lowest rates we’ve secured.</p><p><strong>Base Rate: $60</strong></p><p>Continental US: Base Rate</p><p>US Hawaii, Alaska:  Base Rate + $200</p><p>Canada: Base Rate + $100</p><p>Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam: Base Rate + $100</p><p>Japan, Korea: Base Rate + $200</p><p>Australia, New Zealand: Base Rate + $300  </p><p>Europe (UK, France, Germany, Italy): Base Rate + $120</p><p>Europe (Switzerland, Spain, Sweden): Base Rate + $170<br/> </p><p><strong>Q: How do I pay for shipping?</strong></p><p>Shipping will be charged separately from your claimed perks. We’ll be sending you a survey after the campaign ends to gather information like shipping addresses. A separate shipping charge invoice will be generated for you to pay online via your credit card after we’ve locked down on the lowest shipping costs.<br/> </p><p><strong>Q: What about duties and taxes?</strong></p><p>Duties and taxes differs significantly for different countries. We’re currently working with our shipping experts to determine duties and taxes for each country we will be shipping to. From our initial experience with shipping in the US and to Asia Pacific and European countries, there are no duties involved. Canada customs will likely charge duties + GST/PST.</p><p>Units shipped to California will require us to charge California sales tax.</p><p>Please contact us if you have more specific questions about duties and taxes.<br/> </p><p><strong>Q: When will you start shipping?</strong></p><p>Ohmni will be shipped according to the order of backers; the faster you claim your perks, the earlier you will get your Ohmni. We plan to start shipping by October 2017.<br/> </p><p><strong>Q: Do I need to provide my own tablet for Ohmni?</strong></p><p>No. Our goal is simplicity.  The tablet is fully integrated and installed and configured with our own Ohmni Android firmware.  <br/> </p><p><strong>Q: Does Ohmni charge wirelessly?</strong></p><p>No. Today's wireless charging technology would charge too slowly and would be more expensive. We use our custom designed magnetic contact system developed over 6 generations of charging docks.<br/> </p><p><strong>Q: How long does it take Ohmni to charge?</strong></p><p>For every hour of use, Ohmni needs one hour of charging.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Does the dock change color when charging is complete?</strong></p><p>No. You can check the battery levels on our web app anytime. <br/> </p><p><strong>Q: Can I take Ohmni outside?</strong></p><p>Although Ohmni can handle small bumps in the home, it is not meant for outdoor terrains. It is also not waterproof. However, we do regularly take Ohmni out to show-off. We use hotspot sharing from our phones to supply an internet connection for Ohmni. Be careful and stick to smoother surfaces and Ohmni can definitely be taken outside. <br/> </p><p><strong>Q: What about stairs?</strong></p><p>Ohmni does not handle stairs at the moment. However, at 18 lbs and foldable, it is light enough to carried up and down stairs. <br/> </p><p><strong>Q: What are the system requirements?</strong><br/>The caller should have access to the Chrome browser, a webcam, and a working mic. Ohmni needs only a WiFi connection to operate. Like any other video chat, good WiFi/internet connection is needed on both sides of the call to enjoy high-quality video and audio streams. We recommend at least a 5 Mbps download and 2 Mbps upload internet connection. </p><p>Calling from iPhone Chrome browser is currently not supported but we are planning to add support later this year. </p></div>","Ohmni forever transforms how you stay connected to family miles away.  It's a totally different experience from any Skype or FaceTime call.

Our control interface, MotionMap, pulls everything together and makes it feel really human.   Small motions and gestures with the touchpad or mouse control how the robot moves and looks around, just like a first person game.  Nod with just a flick of the finger. 

It's super easy too. Most people are comfortable controlling Ohmni after just a minute or two, and become pros once they've called in a few times.  It's the closest you can get to being there.
 
 
""The robot is a godsend, it's just like I am there with her.  I can't praise the product enough.  It's so simple, so incredibly simple.""
- Nancy Zaslove, owner of Eiko's Sushi in Napa Valley, CA
Nancy lives an hour away from her mother. She used to drive back and forth just to say hi and spend 30 minutes together. With Ohmni, she now can visit her mother almost daily. Last week, they just played hide-and-seek together over Ohmni.


""I was amazed - no way can I get that kind of interaction with my family using Skype.""
- Jonathan Rugge, CIO, Ohmni Beta UserJonathan is a busy businessman who often travels abroad. He missed all the small but precious moments at home with his family. Now he can just call into Ohmni whenever he is away. Last time, his 5 yr old son held onto Ohmni and said, 'Dad come watch a show with me!'


""At first, we were skeptical grandma would accept a cutting-edge robot, but within seconds she understood its power - the ability to experience her loved ones in a new and profound way.""
- Ping Y., CEO of Stemonix.Ping lives 1000 miles from his 94-year-old grandma. He could only visit once in every few months. Now he can have a face to face chat over dinner with her, or have her see her great granddaughter dance and sing! He notices that their conversations are 10-20x longer.

We're huge proponents of rapid prototyping and getting real world feedback. Over the last 2 years, we iterated through 9 generations of Ohmni, allowing us to tailor the design to meet our user’s needs. In the last 6 months, we have built and shipped 76 units as far as France, Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam.
Most importantly, we're manufacturing in-house, in Silicon Valley, USA, for the following key reasons:

Increased control over entire process and quality.
Continuous improvement by applying Lean Manufacturing principles.
Independence from overseas contract manufacturer schedules, delays, and large up-front costs.
Optimal choices of BOM, suppliers and part alternatives for reduced lead-time and inventory management.
Pull production with Kanban to achieve just-in-time manufacturing.

Although it was not an easy path, we achieved our vision of making a hardware company that iterates quickly and strives for continual improvement. We, in turn, expect to have less execution risk and reduced costs that we can pass on to our backers.
 


 


 

 
Q: Where do you ship?We're shipping to most countries in the following regions. Any countries not in the region that we specified, please contact us directly.North America: US, CanadaAsia Pacific : Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Vietnam, ...Western Europe: UK, France, Sweden, Germany, Most of EU, ...Australasia: Australia, New Zealand Q: How much does shipping cost?Shipping rates are based on region. If your country is not shown on this list but resides in the same region, it will likely have the same rates.These are reference rates quoted by our shipper. We’ve experts working on reducing these costs right now and will likely get better rates as more orders come in. We’re only collecting shipping costs after the campaign ends so you’re guaranteed to pay only the lowest rates we’ve secured.Base Rate: $60Continental US: Base RateUS Hawaii, Alaska:  Base Rate + $200Canada: Base Rate + $100Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam: Base Rate + $100Japan, Korea: Base Rate + $200Australia, New Zealand: Base Rate + $300  Europe (UK, France, Germany, Italy): Base Rate + $120Europe (Switzerland, Spain, Sweden): Base Rate + $170 Q: How do I pay for shipping?Shipping will be charged separately from your claimed perks. We’ll be sending you a survey after the campaign ends to gather information like shipping addresses. A separate shipping charge invoice will be generated for you to pay online via your credit card after we’ve locked down on the lowest shipping costs. Q: What about duties and taxes?Duties and taxes differs significantly for different countries. We’re currently working with our shipping experts to determine duties and taxes for each country we will be shipping to. From our initial experience with shipping in the US and to Asia Pacific and European countries, there are no duties involved. Canada customs will likely charge duties + GST/PST.Units shipped to California will require us to charge California sales tax.Please contact us if you have more specific questions about duties and taxes. Q: When will you start shipping?Ohmni will be shipped according to the order of backers; the faster you claim your perks, the earlier you will get your Ohmni. We plan to start shipping by October 2017. Q: Do I need to provide my own tablet for Ohmni?No. Our goal is simplicity.  The tablet is fully integrated and installed and configured with our own Ohmni Android firmware.   Q: Does Ohmni charge wirelessly?No. Today's wireless charging technology would charge too slowly and would be more expensive. We use our custom designed magnetic contact system developed over 6 generations of charging docks. Q: How long does it take Ohmni to charge?For every hour of use, Ohmni needs one hour of charging. Q: Does the dock change color when charging is complete?No. You can check the battery levels on our web app anytime.  Q: Can I take Ohmni outside?Although Ohmni can handle small bumps in the home, it is not meant for outdoor terrains. It is also not waterproof. However, we do regularly take Ohmni out to show-off. We use hotspot sharing from our phones to supply an internet connection for Ohmni. Be careful and stick to smoother surfaces and Ohmni can definitely be taken outside.  Q: What about stairs?Ohmni does not handle stairs at the moment. However, at 18 lbs and foldable, it is light enough to carried up and down stairs.  Q: What are the system requirements?The caller should have access to the Chrome browser, a webcam, and a working mic. Ohmni needs only a WiFi connection to operate. Like any other video chat, good WiFi/internet connection is needed on both sides of the call to enjoy high-quality video and audio streams. We recommend at least a 5 Mbps download and 2 Mbps upload internet connection. Calling from iPhone Chrome browser is currently not supported but we are planning to add support later this year.",38.0,1,"1 Campaign

Every MUtable includes all 4 height options, enabled by easily switching the table's legs. This way MUtable grows with your kid, all the way up to 8 years old! * MUtable is certified as toy for use from 3 years oldMUtable and its chairs come in five different colors, Mauve, Mint, White, Dove Gray and Tiffany, that you can mix and match according to your interior design style. 
 When playtime's over, kids can easily push all the toys into the hole in the center to drop everything into the toy storage bag underneath. When they want to change games, they just need to flip the board and change bag. You can even organize different toys into different Toy Bags!On each side of the table there is the option to attach up to 3 Side Toy Holders, a convenient cup-like container to store pencils and small toys.  
The Lego ® Tower is an extension of the Lego ® base, enabling kids to play on up to 3 different levels of Lego ®! Every level is double sided and compatible with both the Lego ® Duplo ® and classic Lego ®. Mix up the interchangeable scenarios to boost your kids' creativity!  More scenarios to choose from will be available after the campaign.
 Pretend play has never been so much fun: with just one playhouse you will get 4 different environments to play and up to 24 rooms! No screws are needed to build the house and so it can be easily stored flat when is not used! You can choose between 2 different play houses:Dolls House: includes a family house, a playground, a kindergarten and a museum!Heroes House: includes a police station, a fireman station, a superhero cave and a mountain lodgeBoard games are a fantastic way to exercise logic and tactical skills... but they can also be a way to learn new things! We developed 3 board games on 3 themes that are important for kids.DISKcover Geography: On the double-sided map board, your child will travel around the globe and learn some of the main cultures and animals in the World! DISKcover History: Jump on your time machine and take a journey through time discovering some of the most relevant characters of human history! DISKcover Fruit & Vegetables: Two different games on one single board! On one side, an orchard where your child will take an adventurous trial picking fruit from trees and protecting it from spiteful insects, and twists. On the other side, a vegetable garden where to discover and grow many different vegetables! Puzzles are the best way to stimulate your kids creativity and critical thinking! We developed 6 round puzzles that perfectly fit the MUtable puzzle base. 
 
 More space for more fun! The extension is a steady additional panel that will increase the surface of your MUtable. Up to 6 kids can play or have a seat at the same time...for twice the fun! Use the extension to let your kids play with their friends, have a meal or just have fun with bigger toys. And it is super easy to assemble; just place it on top of the table and fix it with the solid locks below. Included with the extension you will receive an additional disk to store pens and small toys and leave the surface even. With the cover, you can protect the MUtable and let your kids play without worries. This silicone top perfectly fits MUtable and shields it from any kind of damage from colors, water, food... Additionally, when you don't use it, the cover can be a convenient holder for all your MUtable disks!
 Not only do MUtable chairs match perfectly with the table color of your choice, but they will also adjust to the four different heights with the table, ranging from a seat height of 23.5cm to 36cm. A backrest is included with each chair, but it can be removed to transform the MUtable chair into a stool comfortable for grown up players as well. You can add as many chairs as you wish with your MUtable... they are optional as we know that kids love to play in different ways!    Also featured in:

<h3>What makes FurniQi different from IKEA?</h3>

<br/>
<h3>Why support FurniQi?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We, Fonesalesman, made Wireless Charging for the iPhone possible here on
	Indiegogo with the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/iqi-mobile-seamless-wireless-charging-for-iphone/x/5994226#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">iQi Mobile</a>. We
	surpassed our initial goal by more than 500%. Next, we went Completely Wireless
	with the
	<a href=""http://www.fonesalesman.com/collections/wireless-chargers/products/qistone-plus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">QiStone+</a>
	and brought design to wireless charging with the Nature-Infused
	<a href=""http://www.fonesalesman.com/collections/wireless-chargers/products/woodpuck-limited-editions-qi-wireless-charging-pad"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WoodPuck: Bamboo Edition</a>
	which was a proving ground for what would become FurniQi of today.
</p>
<p>FurniQi is a whole different ball game for us as a team. We know our wireless
	charging, but are new to the world of furniture. We have decided that this risk
	was worth taking on as, in our eyes, FurniQi is the future of charging. In order
	to succeed in fighting the giants of the furniture world, we need your support
	and feedback; which is why Indiegogo is an ideal platform for FurniQi to
	materialize on.</p>
<p>But what’s in it for you, anyway? Obviously, an awesome wireless charging
	side table. However, you can also help us in realizing this project by selecting
	from the range of amazing perks - all of them incredibly useful and brilliantly
	easy to use. All the backers get our eternal gratitude &amp; love, of
	course. </p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget to spread the word!</p>

<h3>How does Wireless Charging work?</h3>
<p>
	Qi Wireless Charging isn’t all Hocus-Pocus and Mysterious Voodoo. Wireless power
	transfers through electromagnetic induction, which means that with inductive
	charging, power reaches the device through electromagnetic fields instead of
	through a traditional cable. You need a transmitter (a wireless charging pad)
	and a receiver to charge your device. Receivers are either built into the device
	already, such as with the Samsung S6, or they can be easily installed onto a
	device, like the iPhone.

<h3>FurniQi FAQ</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>1.
	<b>What is FurniQi? </b><br/></p>
<p>
	FurniQi is a sleek and stylish side table that incorporates wireless charging
	stations to make recharging your phone that one step easier. It is a
	contemporary and functional concept of furniture, designed to fit seamlessly
	into the modern home.<br/>
</p>
<p>2. 
	<b>Why is it called FurniQi and how is it pronounced?</b>
</p>
<p>
	The Chinese term for energy is ‘Qi’ (pronounced ‘Chee’). Thus, the essence of
	the product: furniture and energy we merged to create FurniQi. Qi is also the
	most common wireless standard and has been around for a long time - large
	corporations like Samsung and Google have already implemented this technology in
	their phones, but it is also used in other devices like the Motorola Moto 360
	Smartwatch.
</p>
<p>
	3.
	<b>How does it work?</b>
</p>
<p>
	FurniQi uses wireless charging technology to charge your phone just by placing
	it on the charging spot (no wires necessary!). Wireless power transfers through
	electromagnetic induction, which means that with inductive charging, power
	reaches the device through electromagnetic fields instead of through a
	traditional cable.<br/>
</p>
<p>
	4.
	<b>Is it completely wireless?</b>
</p>
<p>
	In terms of charging your phone, yes it is. However, in order to power the
	charging station, FurniQi will need to be plugged in (using a very discreet
	cable).<br/>
</p>
<p>
	5.
	<b>What is FurniQi made out of?</b>
</p>
<p>
	The FurniQi side table is built using Hand-Harvested Mao Zhu Bamboo (grown in
	China), surpassing the appearance of wood. This type of bamboo grows ten times
	quicker than wood, making it possible to be harvested and utilized in an
	incredibly sustainable way. Next, we infused the bamboo table with a dash of our
	Wireless Charging magic, making it pleasing for the eye, but also an
	unbelievably useful object.<br/>
</p>
<p>
	6. 
	<b>Does it come in different colours or sizes?</b>
</p>
<p>
	At this stage, FurniQi only comes in one size and colour. However, dependent on
	demand/success of the initial Indiegogo campaign, we will consider extending the
	FurniQi range.  
</p>
<p>
	7.
	<b>How many </b>
<b>charging spots are there?</b>
</p>
<p>At the moment, FurniQi has only one charging spot (except if you’re getting
	the ‘Table for Two’ perk which includes FurniQi with two charging spots).
	However, depending on feedback from the launch campaign, we will consider all
	options and the product may be updated. </p>
<p>8.  
	<b>Will all smartphones work with FurniQi?</b>
</p>
<p>
	FurniQi incorporates wireless charging that works with Qi compatible smartphones
	or receivers. Receivers are either built into the device already, such as with
	the Samsung S6, or they can be easily installed onto a device, like the iPhone.
	For more information on phone compatibility, please visit the following

</p>
<p>9.
	<b>Can I use FurniQi like any other table?</b>
</p>
<p>Yes. With the function of a table in mind, the wireless charging station has
	been completely water sealed. Water on the surface of the table will not be a
	hazard or cause any damage to the wireless charger.<br/></p>
<p>10.
	<b>When will I receive my FurniQi?</b>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>A few early panda backers will be the lucky ones to receive their FurniQi’s
	before  Christmas; the rest will be shipped post-campaign in March 2016.

	<b>Is FurniQi compatible with Duracell Powermat?</b>
</p>
<p>No, FurniQi is not compatible with Duracell Powermat. Our devices are based on Qi Wireless Standard, supported by companies such as Samsung, Google, Microsoft, LG, Sony, others. Our devices are supported by a wide variety of retailers, including McDonalds, International Airports, Marriott Hotels, and many others.
</p>
<p>Duracell Powermat products are based on PMA technology and are supported by companies such as AT&amp;T. PMA devices can be used in the Starbucks chain of cafeterias. General Motors vehicles only support PMA.
</p>
<p>We chose to pursue a more popular standard which is widely supported, has larger numbers of participating retailers and has larger numbers of supported accessories you could use our products with.
</p>
<p>12.
	<b>How do I add $10 to get a receiver for my phone?</b>
</p>
<p>Underneath every perk you can add 'Additional Gift' to your contribution, so if you put $10 in there we know that we need to send you the receivers. We will get in touch to find out which receiver you wish to get at a later date.

<h3>Pourquoi soutenir FurniQi ?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
	Chez Fonesalesman, nous avons rendu possible la recharge sans fil pour iPhone grâce à Indiegogo et l’ <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/iqi-mobile-seamless-wireless-charging-for-iphone/x/5994226#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">iQi Mobile</a>. Nous avons dépassé notre objectif initial de plus de 500%. Nous sommes donc passés à une option complètement sans-fil avec la  
	<a href=""http://www.fonesalesman.com/collections/wireless-chargers/products/qistone-plus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">QiStone+</a>
	et avons apporté une touche de design à la recharge sans fil avec le  
	<a href=""http://www.fonesalesman.com/collections/wireless-chargers/products/woodpuck-limited-editions-qi-wireless-charging-pad"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WoodPuck : Bamboo Edition</a>
	qui était un terrain d'essai pour ce qui allait devenir FurniQi d'aujourd'hui.
</p>
<p>
	FurniQi est un tout nouveau défi pour nous en tant qu’équipe. Nous connaissons bien notre domaine, mais nous sommes nouveaux dans le monde du mobilier. Nous avons décidé de prendre le risque car nous sommes persuadés qu’il en vaut la peine. À nos yeux, FurniQi est l'avenir du chargement des appareils technologiques. Afin de réussir dans la bataille contre les géants du monde du mobilier, nous avons besoin de votre soutien et de vos commentaires ; et c’est la raison pour laquelle Indiegogo est une plateforme idéale pour la concrétisation de FurniQi.
</p>
<p>
	Mais quels sont les avantages pour vous ? Évidemment, une magnifique table basse pour la recharge sans fil. Cependant, vous pouvez également nous aider à la réalisation de ce projet en choisissant parmi un large éventail de perks, tous incroyablement utiles et très faciles à utiliser. Bien évidemment, tous ceux qui participeront au projet obtiennent notre reconnaissance &amp; notre amour éternels.
</p>
<p>Oh, et n'oubliez pas de prêcher la bonne parole !</p>

<h3>Comment la Recharge Sans Fil fonctionne ?</h3>
<p>
	La Recharge Sans Fil Qi n’est pas du tout un Abracadabra ou un mystère Vaudou. L’énergie Sans Fil se transfère par induction électromagnétique, ce qui signifie que, avec la recharge inductive, l’énergie atteint l'appareil à travers les champs électromagnétiques au lieu de passer par un câble traditionnel. Vous avez besoin d'un émetteur (le chargeur sans fil) et d’un récepteur QI pour recharger votre appareil. Les récepteurs sont soit déjà intégrés dans l’appareil, c’est le cas du Samsung S6, ou bien ils peuvent être facilement installés sur un téléphone, comme avec l'iPhone par exemple.

<h3>Perché Supportare FurniQi?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
	Noi di Fonesalsesman abbiamo reso possibile la Ricarica Wireless per iPhone qui su Indiegogo con <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/iqi-mobile-seamless-wireless-charging-for-iphone/x/5994226#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">iQi Mobile</a>. Abbiamo superato il nostro obiettivo iniziale di oltre il 500%. Successivamente, siamo andati Completamente Wireless con  
	<a href=""http://www.fonesalesman.com/collections/wireless-chargers/products/qistone-plus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">QiStone+</a>
	e abbiamo portato il design nella ricarica wireless con  
	<a href=""http://www.fonesalesman.com/collections/wireless-chargers/products/woodpuck-limited-editions-qi-wireless-charging-pad"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WoodPuck: Bamboo Edition</a>
	ispirato alla natura, che si è dimostrato essere terreno fertile per quello che potrebbe diventare oggi FurniQi.
</p>
<p>
	FurniQi rappresenta una partita totalmente diversa per noi come squadra. Conosciamo la ricarica wireless, ma siamo nuovi nel mondo dell'arredamento. Abbiamo deciso che valeva la pena correre questo rischio poiché, ai nostri occhi, FurniQi rappresenta il futuro della ricarica. Per poter avere successo nel combattere i giganti del mondo dell'arredamento, abbiamo bisogno del vostro supporto e feedback; ecco perché Indiegogo è la piattaforma ideale per far materializzare FurniQi.
</p>
<p>
	Ma cosa ne guadagnate voi, ad ogni modo? Ovviamente, un fenomenale tavolino con ricarica wireless. Tuttavia, potete anche aiutarci a realizzare questo progetto selezionando dalla gamma di perks disponibili - tutti incredibilmente utili e brillantemente semplici da utilizzare. Tutti i sostenitori riceveranno naturalmente anche la nostra eterna gratitudine &amp; amore.
</p>
<p>Oh, e non dimenticate di spargere la voce!</p>

</p>
<h3>Come funziona la Ricarica Wireless?</h3>
<p>
	La Ricarica Wireless Qi non è fatta di abracadabra e voodoo misterioso. L'alimentazione wireless viene trasferita attraverso l'induzione elettromagnetica, il che significa che con la carica induttiva, la corrente raggiunge il dispositivo attraverso i campi elettromagnetici invece che attraverso un cavo tradizionale. Avete bisogno di un trasmettitore (un pad di ricarica wireless) e di un ricevitore per caricare il vostro dispositivo. I ricevitori sono già inseriti nel dispositivo, come nel caso di Samsung S6, oppure possono essere facilmente installati in un dispositivo, come per iPhone.

Meet FurniQi
It is, first and foremost, a simple and elegant bamboo side table.


To make FurniQi extra special, we added some wireless charging magic!


Just drop your phone on the table to charge, then pick up & go!

FurniQi works with 
	many devices!



It is made of Mao Zhu Bamboo, an amazingly versatile and sustainable material that makes it a perfect starting point for FurniQi.





It fits anywhere.

FurniQi comes with a standard caramel-colored USB cable that matches the look
	of the table. As a result, you can use any of the USB wall adapters, or a myriad
	of other power sources including the
	QiStone+.



FurniQi is resistant to daily mishaps. Designed for living, made for life.



Thanks to an optional audible notification and a carefully lasered impression
	to indicate charging spot, FurniQi is easy to use even at night, without turning
	the lights on.


FurniQi is a breeze to assemble! You can be ready to charge in mere minutes.

What makes FurniQi different from IKEA?



Why support FurniQi?



We, Fonesalesman, made Wireless Charging for the iPhone possible here on
	Indiegogo with the iQi Mobile. We
	surpassed our initial goal by more than 500%. Next, we went Completely Wireless
	with the
	QiStone+
	and brought design to wireless charging with the Nature-Infused
	WoodPuck: Bamboo Edition
	which was a proving ground for what would become FurniQi of today.

FurniQi is a whole different ball game for us as a team. We know our wireless
	charging, but are new to the world of furniture. We have decided that this risk
	was worth taking on as, in our eyes, FurniQi is the future of charging. In order
	to succeed in fighting the giants of the furniture world, we need your support
	and feedback; which is why Indiegogo is an ideal platform for FurniQi to
	materialize on.
But what’s in it for you, anyway? Obviously, an awesome wireless charging
	side table. However, you can also help us in realizing this project by selecting
	from the range of amazing perks - all of them incredibly useful and brilliantly
	easy to use. All the backers get our eternal gratitude & love, of
	course. 
Oh, and don’t forget to spread the word!

How does Wireless Charging work?

	Qi Wireless Charging isn’t all Hocus-Pocus and Mysterious Voodoo. Wireless power
	transfers through electromagnetic induction, which means that with inductive
	charging, power reaches the device through electromagnetic fields instead of
	through a traditional cable. You need a transmitter (a wireless charging pad)
	and a receiver to charge your device. Receivers are either built into the device
	already, such as with the Samsung S6, or they can be easily installed onto a
	device, like the iPhone.

FurniQi FAQ


1.
	What is FurniQi? 

	FurniQi is a sleek and stylish side table that incorporates wireless charging
	stations to make recharging your phone that one step easier. It is a
	contemporary and functional concept of furniture, designed to fit seamlessly
	into the modern home.

2. 
	Why is it called FurniQi and how is it pronounced?


	The Chinese term for energy is ‘Qi’ (pronounced ‘Chee’). Thus, the essence of
	the product: furniture and energy we merged to create FurniQi. Qi is also the
	most common wireless standard and has been around for a long time - large
	corporations like Samsung and Google have already implemented this technology in
	their phones, but it is also used in other devices like the Motorola Moto 360
	Smartwatch.


	3.
	How does it work?


	FurniQi uses wireless charging technology to charge your phone just by placing
	it on the charging spot (no wires necessary!). Wireless power transfers through
	electromagnetic induction, which means that with inductive charging, power
	reaches the device through electromagnetic fields instead of through a
	traditional cable.


	4.
	Is it completely wireless?


	In terms of charging your phone, yes it is. However, in order to power the
	charging station, FurniQi will need to be plugged in (using a very discreet
	cable).


	5.
	What is FurniQi made out of?


	The FurniQi side table is built using Hand-Harvested Mao Zhu Bamboo (grown in
	China), surpassing the appearance of wood. This type of bamboo grows ten times
	quicker than wood, making it possible to be harvested and utilized in an
	incredibly sustainable way. Next, we infused the bamboo table with a dash of our
	Wireless Charging magic, making it pleasing for the eye, but also an
	unbelievably useful object.


	6. 
	Does it come in different colours or sizes?


	At this stage, FurniQi only comes in one size and colour. However, dependent on
	demand/success of the initial Indiegogo campaign, we will consider extending the
	FurniQi range.  


	7.
	How many 
charging spots are there?

At the moment, FurniQi has only one charging spot (except if you’re getting
	the ‘Table for Two’ perk which includes FurniQi with two charging spots).
	However, depending on feedback from the launch campaign, we will consider all
	options and the product may be updated. 
8.  
	Will all smartphones work with FurniQi?


	FurniQi incorporates wireless charging that works with Qi compatible smartphones
	or receivers. Receivers are either built into the device already, such as with
	the Samsung S6, or they can be easily installed onto a device, like the iPhone.
	For more information on phone compatibility, please visit the following
	link: 
	http://www.fonesalesman.com/pages/qi-enabled-mobiles.

9.
	Can I use FurniQi like any other table?

Yes. With the function of a table in mind, the wireless charging station has
	been completely water sealed. Water on the surface of the table will not be a
	hazard or cause any damage to the wireless charger.
10.
	When will I receive my FurniQi?


A few early panda backers will be the lucky ones to receive their FurniQi’s
	before  Christmas; the rest will be shipped post-campaign in March 2016.

11.
	Is FurniQi compatible with Duracell Powermat?

No, FurniQi is not compatible with Duracell Powermat. Our devices are based on Qi Wireless Standard, supported by companies such as Samsung, Google, Microsoft, LG, Sony, others. Our devices are supported by a wide variety of retailers, including McDonalds, International Airports, Marriott Hotels, and many others.

Duracell Powermat products are based on PMA technology and are supported by companies such as AT&T. PMA devices can be used in the Starbucks chain of cafeterias. General Motors vehicles only support PMA.

We chose to pursue a more popular standard which is widely supported, has larger numbers of participating retailers and has larger numbers of supported accessories you could use our products with.

12.
	How do I add $10 to get a receiver for my phone?

Underneath every perk you can add 'Additional Gift' to your contribution, so if you put $10 in there we know that we need to send you the receivers. We will get in touch to find out which receiver you wish to get at a later date.

Pourquoi soutenir FurniQi ?




	Chez Fonesalesman, nous avons rendu possible la recharge sans fil pour iPhone grâce à Indiegogo et l’ iQi Mobile. Nous avons dépassé notre objectif initial de plus de 500%. Nous sommes donc passés à une option complètement sans-fil avec la

Comment la Recharge Sans Fil fonctionne ?

	La Recharge Sans Fil Qi n’est pas du tout un Abracadabra ou un mystère Vaudou. L’énergie Sans Fil se transfère par induction électromagnétique, ce qui signifie que, avec la recharge inductive, l’énergie atteint l'appareil à travers les champs électromagnétiques au lieu de passer par un câble traditionnel. Vous avez besoin d'un émetteur (le chargeur sans fil) et d’un récepteur QI pour recharger votre appareil. Les récepteurs sont soit déjà intégrés dans l’appareil, c’est le cas du Samsung S6, ou bien ils peuvent être facilement installés sur un téléphone, comme avec l'iPhone par exemple.

Perché Supportare FurniQi?




	Noi di Fonesalsesman abbiamo reso possibile la Ricarica Wireless per iPhone qui su Indiegogo con iQi Mobile. Abbiamo superato il nostro obiettivo iniziale di oltre il 500%. Successivamente, siamo andati Completamente Wireless con  
	QiStone+

	WoodPuck: Bamboo Edition
	ispirato alla natura, che si è dimostrato essere terreno fertile per quello che potrebbe diventare oggi FurniQi.


	FurniQi rappresenta una partita totalmente diversa per noi come squadra. Conosciamo la ricarica wireless, ma siamo nuovi nel mondo dell'arredamento.

Tutti i sostenitori riceveranno naturalmente anche la nostra eterna gratitudine & amore.

Oh, e non dimenticate di spargere la voce!








▲

Come funziona la Ricarica Wireless?

	La Ricarica Wireless Qi non è fatta di abracadabra e voodoo misterioso. L'alimentazione wireless viene trasferita attraverso l'induzione elettromagnetica, il che significa che con la carica induttiva, la corrente raggiunge il dispositivo attraverso i campi elettromagnetici invece che attraverso un cavo tradizionale. Avete bisogno di un trasmettitore (un pad di ricarica wireless) e di un ricevitore per caricare il vostro dispositivo. I ricevitori sono già inseriti nel dispositivo, come nel caso di Samsung S6, oppure possono essere facilmente installati in un dispositivo, come per iPhone.

<h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT:</h3>

<p>As we grow older it often makes sense to skip making our beds to get to work on time or prepare breakfast for the kids. And for people living with disability, making their bed can represent long and painful moments trying to preserve some comfort and a sense of dignity.</p>
<p>That is why we created SMARTDUVET!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks and challenges:</h3>
<p>For every project there is risk involved. We've detailed below the 2 key risks involved with a project like ours:</p>
<p>1- Sourcing:</p>
<p>Sourcing is not an easy task, as many of you know, it is one of the most crucial parts of any project involving a physical product. Sourcing with the wrong suppliers can have disastrous consequences on quality and delivery schedule.</p>
<p>That is why we made the decision to work with an experienced family run sourcing company with family members living here as well as in Asia. This gives us the incredible advantage to be able to, not only find the best suppliers, but also achieve unrivaled quality control and total access to every step of the fulfillment process.</p>
<p>2.Unexpected high demand:</p>
<p>It might seem like the problem every entrepreneur wants to have, but in reality not planning for huge demand can cause delays and ruin client satisfaction.</p>
<p>We make sure that the suppliers we are working with have production capacity that would dwarf even the biggest success stories seen on Kickstarter.

Still over 30% below retail price..The perfect Christmas present. Pre-order now and download your set of Christmas gift cards to give to your loved ones or to enjoy yourself here. Enjoy our Christmas cards while we will be working hard to get the knives to you as soon as possible. The package also contains a selection of non-Christmas cards for all the winter birthdays or other occasions for a gift card. (optimized for 10x15cm or 4x6"" print)Estimated delivery is March 2019. (see also chapter VI. below).Read the whole story here:The VEARK CK01 - as featured on: Welcome to the VEARK - CK01: your Single Piece Stainless Steel Chef's Knife. I. Design - a knife is a toolThe inspiration for the design of the VEARK CK01 was drawn from the believe that the knife is a tool - maybe even the most essential tool in your kitchen.Based on that idea we took visual cues from the world of traditional metal tools as inspiration for the appearance of our knives.Our aim was to create a piece that will generate it's beauty and character from it's raw appearance rather than by adding features like wood and rivets - less is more. II. Ergonomics - not afraid of the bladeLooking at how professional chefs hold their knives we developed the open handle design: It invites you to slide your thumb onto the blade and grab the knife right at the balance point - making it a pleasure to work with. III. Manufacturing - classic drop forgeThe manufacturing is done in a classic drop forging process which takes place in the traditional knife forging town of Solingen, Germany. Experienced craftsmen use all their skill to produce a knife of highest quality.The drop forging process leaves each knife with it's individual pattern on the handle, just like a fingerprint. So each knife is a unique piece - no two are alike. A beautiful detail that gives each knife it's own character. IV. Hard facts - (58 Rockwell hard to be precise)The CK01 features a 20cm (7,9"") blade while the overall length is 32cm (12,6""). It is drop forged from stainless steel (X50CRMoV15) and weighs 200g (7oz.).The typical Solingen knife has a hardness of 55-56 Rockwell, we even exceed that at 58 Rockwell. What that basically means is: a harder knife can get sharper and remain a sharp edge for longer (depending on use and maintenance of course - see also chapter V.).lefttop right V. Stay sharp - Diamond steel sharpening rod package offersTo keep your knife sharp as day one, we recommend the regular use of a sharpening rod. We will offer packages including a high quality diamond steel rod made in Germany. It's an oval steel rod, covered with microcrystalline diamonds, which will make it easy to maintain the sharp edge of your knife. We will provide proper instructions on how to sharpen your knife to all backers and we are also planning to make the sharpening rod available to all backers as an add on after the campaign.Stay Sharp Package VI. ""Where's my knife, man?"" - Estimated TimelineWe estimate to be ready to ship the knives out to original Kickstarter backers all end of February / beginning of March 2019 all Indiegogo orders will be handled right after but basically will go out more or less at the same time.We will keep you updated during the whole production process.Estimated timeline - Status Nov 2018 VII. That's it - Thanks for checking out our project.We hope you like our Chef's Knife as much as we do and will happily support our campaign. Even better, share it with your family and friends to bring this product to as many people as possible to love and enjoy. Our goal is to kickstart a sustainable business of creating more high quality products like this one and we hope you want to help us to achieve that..Thank you. VIII.

<h3>Why Tea?</h3>
<p>Aloha, my name is Elyse Petersen. Last year I began an exploration with my classmate and business partner Jane Gonsowshi into the global tea community. We first studied the feasibility of Hawai‘i developing a globally recognized tea industry. In the process we made many friends and learned that tea propogation and cultivation is one of many feasible solutions for Hawai‘i's food self-sufficiency crisis.</p>
<p>I then spent 4 months living and working with tea farmers in Wazuka, Kyoto, Japan. Here I was exposed to the challenges that independent tea farmers face around the world. </p>
<p>With knowing the opportunity there is for tea to bring people together and to make agriculture profitable I decided I would become a ""Global Tea Ambassador"" or tea farm advocate.</p>
<p>Since returning to Hawai‘i I have dedicated my time to build a tool that can bridge tea growers and tea drinkers: <a href=""http://www.tealet.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tealet</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We can build Tealet together</h3>
<p>Here's the things we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>engaged community</li>

</ul>
<p>By utilizing crowdfunding you are able to help us with two of those pieces: community and money. The best part about it is that in return you get to experience some of the best teas the world has to offer!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our ultimate goal there is no need to worry. You still get tea and we will still continue to build Tealet. In fact, the most valuable goal of this campaign, community, will be achieved regardless.</p>

⚡️AIRPLANE PUSH PIN OPTION⚡️ Plane-shaped pins to stylish mark the places you’ve been.  
These maps already have ONE hole in each country and in each state, so you can put a pin in them. If you don't want holes, please let us know!
You can put pins in without the holes, but you have to make some efforts.
Pins are white metal, shaped like a plane, are very durable and measure 4 cm (1.6”) long. 
     ⚡️Also you can choose from 2 new colors - Blue and Grey⚡️ ⚡️Ocean Names For Free⚡️Assembling is a really fun process. You don't need any special tools to install the map on the wall because package includes sticky double sided adhesive (tape) and also on the each piece there are numbers which match template on the instructions you will get :) All pieces of the map are packed in polystyrene and also in gift wrapping so you don’t have to think about it.  XXL - 92x66x20 cm (36x26x8 in), 24 kg (53 lb)XL – 68x52x15 cm (27x20.5x5.9 in), 11 kg (15.5 lb)    L – 53x42x16 cm (21x16.5x6.3  in), 7 kg (8.8 lb)  M – 53x32x11 cm (21x12.6x4.3 in), 4 kg (4.5 lb)☄️  New instruction for installation ☄️We've created new feature for installation that makes it even easier than before. It's Corner template! Attach corner #1 to the top left point, measure the distance accordingly to your map's size (M, L, XL, XXL) and attach corner #2 on the top right side. That's all.  Now, you should begin sticking pieces to the wall starting from the side parts (pieces #3 and #17) and other pieces, they will fit perfectly on your wall and will be in the correct place. Approximate time to assemble: 40-60 minutes To find out the shipping fee, please sum up the weight of the maps in your pledge, and find the corresponding value in the table below.  Also there is  information in each pledge according to the shipping cost.XXL - 24 kg (53 lb)XL – 11 kg (15.5 lb)  L – 7 kg (8.8 lb)  M – 4 kg (4.5 lb)Note, we count volume weight as it's higher than actual weight.For example, if you would like Xl maps + L map + 2 M maps, you just have to add the weight: 11 + 7 + 2x4 = 26 kg all together. And Just find the right price in the table below. • If you want to buy push pins, simply add the cost of push pins to your pledge.• If you have selected a few maps, the shipping cost will be less than if we send them one by one.  • To find out the shipping fee, please sum up the weight of the maps in your pledge, including add-ons, and find the corresponding value in the table below.We use the most convenient and reliable delivery method.

</h4><p>We started this mission last year, when we were just Makers dreaming about Stereolitography 3d Printing being finally affordable. We designed and built a device so compact that it was even foldable! It was called LumiFold, and it started a revolution about compact and portable 3d printing. It gained a lot of popularity very quickly! <br/></p>People were really interested and excited about a compact 3d printer which was affordable and also able to give them the results they expected when they first heard about 3d printing. They wanted a reliable and easy to use device, that didn't require any technical knowledge.<br/><br/>Thank to the supporters of our first IndieGoGo campaign and the 
enthusiatic comments we received every time we presented LumiFold to the
 public, from Maker Faires to international blogs, we decided to go furhter, and spent the last months designing and refining our next 3d printer, the LumiPocket, trying to make it as minimalistic as possible, removing everything that was unnecessary.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1018075/files/20141115153346-infogr.jpg?1416094426"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The result of all this work is the most compact 3d printer, with an high printing quality, easy to use and reliable!<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1230440/files/20150218032739-banner3.jpg?1424258859"" src="""" style=""""/></p><blockquote>(Above: samples printed at 100 micron) <br/>

Printer. It has a printing area of 10cm diameter, 10cm tall, and supports many different types of printing materials, from a resin similar to PLA and ABS, to castable for jewelry. Other types include flexible or strong resins, even ceramic filled.A big thank you to all our contributors! You made our LumiPocket a real product. We are currently producing our first batch.The campaign is now closed.Your support allows us to make high quality, affordable 3d printing available to everyone. We are still improving the quality, below you can see some of our latest printed parts!What can you print with LumiPocket?Check our instructables and learn how to print your own 3d printed speakers, how to make custom metal parts, or print jewelry designs with castable resin!  Lumi Industries supports now LibraryLyna, a company dedicated to bringing 3D models to blind students! Check their website: http://www.librarylyna.com/LumiPocket, the story
We started this mission last year, when we were just Makers dreaming about Stereolitography 3d Printing being finally affordable. We designed and built a device so compact that it was even foldable! It was called LumiFold, and it started a revolution about compact and portable 3d printing. It gained a lot of popularity very quickly! People were really interested and excited about a compact 3d printer which was affordable and also able to give them the results they expected when they first heard about 3d printing. They wanted a reliable and easy to use device, that didn't require any technical knowledge.Thank to the supporters of our first IndieGoGo campaign and the 
enthusiatic comments we received every time we presented LumiFold to the
 public, from Maker Faires to international blogs, we decided to go furhter, and spent the last months designing and refining our next 3d printer, the LumiPocket, trying to make it as minimalistic as possible, removing everything that was unnecessary.The result of all this work is the most compact 3d printer, with an high printing quality, easy to use and reliable!(Above: samples printed at 100 micron) 

 is versatile!Just by adjusting the projector height, you can go from printing very detailed object, like jewelry molds, from bigger parts up to 10cm diameter by 10 cm tall. This means that LumiPocket can be used to print many different objects, not just tiny parts!
 is fast!With the best projector we tested (AcerP1500) and our recommended resin (FuntToDo IB) the curing time per layer can be as low as 0,7 seconds, with a printing area of 10x5cm.With a ~320$ projector like the Optoma DX325 or the Acer x1240/60, curing time per layer is about 3-7 seconds, that is still faster than even more expensive FDM printers, and remember that with DLP projection, printing speed is not affected by object complexity, or by the number of parts to be printed on the same tray.
 is reliable and requires little maintenance(Goodbye, disposable vats and expensive non-stick coating)With our top projection system, we removed one the most annoying parts related with light curing resin: the need to replace often the printing vat, a delicate transparent contianer for the resin, that does also need expensive anti-sticiing coatings, often difficult to apply that last only for a certain number of prints before start degrading.Projecting from above, we removed the need for a special vat, and it will double its function of printing vat and resin container with its cover for storing the resin. You can have one for each type of resin you have and changing material on your printer is as simple as swapping the vats.
  is really easy to use!We designed a cross plaftorm software that takes care of everything: you just need to load a .STL  file and it will take care of the slicing and printing. If you don't have 3d modeling knowledge, you can use our integrated 3d search engine that will let you browse online for 3d models , our use our basic templates to print many customizable objects, from Litophanes to personalized rings or keychains.It supports the newest input technologies like the Leap Motion, an innovative devide able to track your gestures and hands movements, providing a new way to explore and model 3d objects.The software we provide is also retrocompatible with our first printer LumiFold, and will also add support for the HoloDock, a visualization device that we launched on our first campaign.The program also assists you during the calibration of the projector.It will later be available on our website for free.Technical specifications

In general, people loved it, but they really wanted it to do more... and wanted speakers!</p><p>Soon after we shipped all of our Sandman pre-orders, we started development on what would become the Doppler. The main feature that separates the Doppler from the original Sandman? You got it, speakers!</p><p>Here are some early sketches of the Doppler showing it's design evolution:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/387/504/4f1bb0dab163b5e65d52293c904bca5e_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1499286828&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=7fd682f3a39de1e7010ec1367f912716"" src=""""/></p><div data-id=""17387504""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p> </p></figure></div><p>Once we chose the design and form factor for the Doppler, we could get deep into the actual mechanical engineering. Because the Doppler has speakers we had to acoustically tune the design to get the best possible sound. To do this, we experimented with different methods of sealing the Doppler, having different bass port designs (that's what the hole in the back of the Doppler is). As well as different air volumes for the sound to resonate in. This was an iterative process of testing, designing, 3d printing, and testing again. We now have a design we are very happy with!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/391/271/7a313ac102672c5d41a2dfce5d79980d_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1499307845&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a8d3585e2a06baa1b3d1cafb79ac1f6b"" src=""""/></p><p>While all of the industrial design, mechanical, and electrical engineering was going on, our software guys were hard at work on the software for the Doppler. We broke down the components of the software and tackled them one at a time: Wifi connectivity, connecting to a phone app, playing sounds, recording sound from the microphones, communicating with Amazon's servers (for Alexa support), and changing the colors of the LEDs.  </p><p>About two months ago we ""locked"" down the features of the Doppler and started focusing on the plan to get it manufactured. We met with the head of our manufacturing partner about the Doppler, went through the manufacturing plan, the costs, and most importantly some very important feedback called DFM (design for manufacturing). Our manufacturing partner is very excited about the new product and is ready to bring it the life.</p><p><b>Why we need help from Indiegogo</b></p><p>The tooling required to make the Doppler at scale is very expensive and is a one-time, sunk cost. We needed Kickstarter's help to get this paid for so we can start selling Dopplers to the world. Now that the Kickstarter is over we are preselling the Doppler on Indiegogo. </p><p>      </p><div data-id=""17513339""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1502291701/xppv6nfkcze62zgtthsc.png"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><p>Below is our estimated timeline.

The Doppler is Amazon Alexa enabled, so you can communicate with the Doppler using your voice. Amazon Alexa is built in the cloud, so it is always getting smarter. The more you use Alexa, the more it adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary, and preferences with new features continually being added. Ask Alexa to answer questions, hear the news, get weather and traffic reports, control your smart home, and more.You can use most Amazon Alexa skills on the Doppler. These will expand its capabilities even further. Some examples include:      Tired of repeating yourself or need to be quiet? Use the Doppler's customizable smart buttons to repeat a command at the press of a button. Stream music or automate your home, the possibilities are endless. Want to turn on the lights or order pizza? The quick access buttons will allow you to activate tons of services at the touch of a button.
Some of many examples that work with the Doppler's quick access buttons.Quick Access examples:        With acoustically and digitally tuned full-range stereo speakers, the Sandman Doppler plays music with amazing clarity.  The Doppler connects via Bluetooth to your phone allowing you to stream your favorite music to the Doppler's speakers. Just like smartphones or computers, the Doppler connects to your home’s internet wirelessly via Wi-Fi. This allows features that most alarm clocks don’t have like weather notifications, Amazon Alexa, and automatic time syncing.       At a glance, quickly view the traffic on your commute, today's weather, stock prices, or even your calendar. Don't need that information? You can turn it off leaving just the time on the Doppler's huge 1.8"" display. The Doppler also has a built in light sensor so the screen will automatically adjust when the brightness in the room changes, you can even turn the display totally off if you'd prefer to sleep in total darkness.Multi-color RGB LED's allow you to customize the Doppler's screen color. Teal? Ochre? Fuchsia? No problem!      Phones, smartwatches, fitness trackers, tablets, power banks, cameras, and anything else that charges via USB are no problem for the Doppler. It has 6 high power USB charging ports so you can charge all of your devices at once.To eliminate the mess of all of these cables the Doppler has a simple and effective cable management system which allows you to route your cables underneath the Doppler to organize them. There is no power brick so only one power cable goes from the back of the Doppler to the wall. The Doppler's internal power supply is dual voltage (110/220) so it will work worldwide.        In case your devices have USB-C you won't be left without a charge. You can swap out three regular USB ports and get three USB-C ports (sold separately and will be available at launch).       It's a smart clock, so it must have an app! Easily setup and control all aspects of the Doppler from the intuitive and free Sandman app (iOS and Android). You’ll need to use the app when you setup the Doppler and to update the software on the Doppler. We will be able to update the Doppler’s feature remotely so you can look forward to new features all the time.Using the app you’ll be able to control multiple alarms on different days of the week. You’ll also be able to set alarms with your voice or directly onto the Doppler using the buttons. A large snooze button on top delays the inevitable. App UX development
 Keep track of the time with large 1.8 inch auto-dimming numbers. Time can be displayable in 12 or 24 hour time modes.       The Doppler is powered by the Next Thing Co.’s C.H.I.P. Pro and are both open source products. Want to add your own features? Great! Access the C.H.I.P. Pro via a hidden Micro-USB port.      Some have said that the bedside Alarm is going the way of the dodo, we all have phones! Here is why the Doppler is going to save the alarm clock from extinction.It's Better at Checking the TimeWe have all been there before, you want to check the time in the middle of the night. When you look at your phone you get blinded even if you have your brightness set to the lowest settings. After you check the time you frequently get distracted by whatever else is on your phone causing restless sleep. With an alarm clock like the Doppler, it's huge 1.8"" numbers can be easily seen from across the room or without your glasses on.It's Better at SnoozingThe Doppler can't be easily knocked off, tilted, or moved on your nightstand. The Doppler's illuminated snooze button makes it easy to find, even in a sleepy daze.It's Better at Playing Your MusicPhone speakers are getting better and better every generation, but they aren't anything compared to the stereo speakers on the Doppler.It Comes at a Better PriceA comparable setup would cost you:
Amazon Echo Dot ($50)
6-port USB Charging Station ($23)
Bluetooth Stereo Speaker ($75)
Alarm Clock ($19)
Power Strip ($10)
6 USB extension cables ($30)
Comparable setup  = $207Sandman Doppler = $119 (Indiegogo price)
+ includes customizable RGB digits
+ includes date, weather, temperature Dashboard indicators
+ clean cable management
 Have any questions? Post a comment here or Email us here: info@paloaltoinnovation.com     We are hoping to have the Sandman Doppler available in 7 colors. But in order to reach our manufacturer's minimums we are going to require a minimum of 100 Dopplers in each color in order to produce it.

   We founded PAI (Palo Alto Innovation)  In early 2015 we wanted to make our own products and created the original Sandman, a 4 port USB charger alarm clock. We Brought Our Own Product to MarketWe learned a lot about how to run a business, a crowdfunding campaign, and about our product, the Sandman Clock (available now on our site and Amazon). In general, people loved it, but they really wanted it to do more... and wanted speakers!Soon after we shipped all of our Sandman pre-orders, we started development on what would become the Doppler. The main feature that separates the Doppler from the original Sandman? You got it, speakers!Here are some early sketches of the Doppler showing it's design evolution: Once we chose the design and form factor for the Doppler, we could get deep into the actual mechanical engineering. Because the Doppler has speakers we had to acoustically tune the design to get the best possible sound. To do this, we experimented with different methods of sealing the Doppler, having different bass port designs (that's what the hole in the back of the Doppler is). As well as different air volumes for the sound to resonate in. This was an iterative process of testing, designing, 3d printing, and testing again. We now have a design we are very happy with!While all of the industrial design, mechanical, and electrical engineering was going on, our software guys were hard at work on the software for the Doppler. We broke down the components of the software and tackled them one at a time: Wifi connectivity, connecting to a phone app, playing sounds, recording sound from the microphones, communicating with Amazon's servers (for Alexa support), and changing the colors of the LEDs.  About two months ago we ""locked"" down the features of the Doppler and started focusing on the plan to get it manufactured. We met with the head of our manufacturing partner about the Doppler, went through the manufacturing plan, the costs, and most importantly some very important feedback called DFM (design for manufacturing). Our manufacturing partner is very excited about the new product and is ready to bring it the life.Why we need help from IndiegogoThe tooling required to make the Doppler at scale is very expensive and is a one-time, sunk cost. We needed Kickstarter's help to get this paid for so we can start selling Dopplers to the world. Now that the Kickstarter is over we are preselling the Doppler on Indiegogo.       Below is our estimated timeline. Please note that we will do our best to stick to this timeline. If something slips due to us, our manufacturer, or other vendors, we will update you. UPDATE: As of 3/12 this is the latest schedule for Indiegogo backers. Check the updates for the most up to date info.

<h3><strong>Warranty</strong></h3>
<p>I offer a one year warranty for all purchases.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
<p>The idea came to me during a trip to the Dominicaine republic. There was couple near us on the beach. The lady was lying on her beach chair and wanted to read lying on her stomach with her book on the ground but it caused her discomfort in the neck and shoulders. She asked her hunsband to find a solution for her to be comfortable. Her hunsband has done everything possible to satisfy her but he did not find anything. That’s when I got the idea to create a comfortable cushion to install on a lounge chair in any possible positions. It’s after several prototypes that I finally managed to create the Comfort Cushion.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Who Am I</strong></h3>
<p>Inventor of the Comfort Cushion my name is Danielle Belanger. I was born in Quebec city in Canada. My main job is a waitress.

 This campaign was organized to mobilize the necessary funds to develop, manufacture and distribute Comfort Cushion.
 Comfort Cushion is a revolutionary new product for tourism applications, professional and personal. This is a huge market because of its multiple functions. It will be particularly appreciated during the holidays. Growing concern for the comfort as well as the tendency for general relaxation have created a market for products that reduce tensions and problems associated with improper positioning.
 
 
         
        
 
 The products multiple use
Comfort Cushion is a comfortable cushion for the head that is placed on a lounge chair on the beach or on a bed.It can also serve as a rest for the plane. During your travels, you find that the hotels pillow is not comfortable, then you use the Comfort Cushion and sleep well. In an event where you have to sit use the cushion and you sit on it. The Comfort Cushion helps you make your vacantion more enjoyable. It provides comfort and reduces stiffness of wrong positioning when you are lying on your stomach during tanning sessions or on a bed during massage.

History
The idea came to me during a trip to the Dominicaine republic. There was couple near us on the beach. The lady was lying on her beach chair and wanted to read lying on her stomach with her book on the ground but it caused her discomfort in the neck and shoulders. She asked her hunsband to find a solution for her to be comfortable. Her hunsband has done everything possible to satisfy her but he did not find anything. That’s when I got the idea to create a comfortable cushion to install on a lounge chair in any possible positions. It’s after several prototypes that I finally managed to create the Comfort Cushion.
 
Who Am I
Inventor of the Comfort Cushion my name is Danielle Belanger. I was born in Quebec city in Canada. My main job is a waitress. I count a few years as secretary and accounting for the compagny of my hunsband. I make sure to surround myself with the wright people to help me ensure proper managment of the compagny in all areas.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello,<br/>My name is Marta and I live in a beautiful little town called Slunj in Croatia :)<br/>I'm an artist and I am constantly inspired by the beautiful nature I am surrounded with.<br/>I'm a nature lover and a tree huger :)<br/>I love long walks through the forest, and what saddens me the most is when I see people throwing waste, especially large waste in ditches and beautiful groves in the forest.<br/>As an environmentally conscious person I live by the rule:<br/>Reduce, reuse, recycle, repair or make :)</p>
<p>I love junk! :)<br/>And I often salvage old things from getting thrown in the dumpster,<br/>like: old dishes, hand me down clothes and my favorite - old vintage furniture and antique trinkets and decorations :)<br/>I believe that people need to be reminded of old life values and old ways. Modern lifestyle is unfortunately based on wasteful mentality and mass production of low quality goods.</p>
<p>I love crafting! :D <br/>My passion is creating something new and beautiful out of the old and rusty. Old stuff can be reused in so many creative ways and it gives me a lot of pleasure to give it a new purpose. Vintage things carry the story of their past owners and that almost makes them alive, and by renewing them I give them a new life :)</p>
<p>I want to share this passion with others and I want to teach people to create and surround themselves with beautiful things that have a story to them as well.</p>
<p>I've thought a lot about how I could combine my passions and experiences to make a difference in my local community.<br/>Preaching has never worked well, so I thought maybe it would be best to just give the people a different choice, because, as Bob Merritt wrote - ""A good choice today will lead to a better tomorrow. We have the power to choose."" We have to use that power wisely.</p>
<p>A second hand shop seemed like the only logical solution.<br/>So I decided to open the first Vintage Shop in town :)<br/><br/>What's special about my store is that I plan to create a small and cozy space for reading and relaxing where the customers could sit and maybe read a few lines of a book that intrigued them, or just observe the decorations and ornaments while listening to relaxing music. I believe that a warmly decorated environment in which the buyers would feel at home would have a relaxing effect and allow them to leisurely try on the items they like and leave the store with full hands without feeling a drastic decrease in their budget, which is the charm of shopping second hand.</p>
<p><strong>I'm just trying to make an honest living by combining my experiences and passions. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Please help me achieve that.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>I have done a lot of calculating and I have come to the amount of 5.000$ (3.700$ for products, 850$ for store interior design and 450$ for Web shop). I believe that would be enough to decorate the shop locality, create a Web shop and supply the store with all the products I would love to sell, which are:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Second hand clothing and shoes for men, women and children</li>
<li>Old renewed furniture and lighting appliances in vintage style</li>
<li>A bunch of old books!, vinyls and antique decorations </li>
<li>Kitchen accessories in vintage style like - utensils, cookware, baking supplies, glasses, mugs, food storage containers made from glass and ceramics (not plastic).</li>
<li>Handmade home decor textiles in vintage style - kitchen and bathroom towels, aprons, coasters, curtains, bed sheets, pillow covers and decor pillows etc.</li>
<li>Arts and craft supplies</li>
<li>All kinds of decorations, jewelry and art created by local artists</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>In the facility I plan to arrange a small cozy space for reading and relaxing for customers to feel more comfortable and to take their time to select clothes and small gifts for themselves or their loved ones, and maybe read a few lines of the book which they may have an interest in. I believe that a warmly decorated environment in which the buyers would feel at home would have a relaxing effect and allow the customers to go wild and try all the items they like and leave the store with full hands without feeling a drastic decrease in their household budget, which is the charm of shopping in a store with second-hand goods.</li>
<li>For customers that prefer to shop in the peaceful corner of their house, I would create a website and profiles on various social networks to provide information at all times about new collections and offers, and a variety of monthly sales, which of course would be successful marketing for the store and would attract new customers. I would also allow customers the ability to order their desired items if they weren't available in the store.</li>
<li>My goal is to create a family atmosphere where everyone would feel welcome.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here are some ideas for the store's interior design:<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/forestskyowl/vintage-shop-ideas/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.pinterest.com/forestskyowl/vintage-...</a></strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485010609/yiqxrfulbjvyjimokyjr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>If I don't reach my goal I would still use the funds to try to start the business. I would start with less supplies, but I would still try to make it work, since this is currently my only option to earn a living for me and my small family.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to provide the local community with cheap but great quality products produced in our country. That way I would give them more for less, and I would also be supporting my country's economy. I believe that shopping second hand is ecological, and I would try to acquire kitchen supplies made from recyclable and more environmentally friendly materials, so in that way I would at least have a small impact in protecting our already highly polluted planet. I also want to encourage local artists to create and sell their art and products, to encourage buying local and to help some starving artists to put some funds in their home budgets. </p>
<p>My long term goal is to create a successful business where my whole family could work. <br/>My mother is an experienced seamstress (among other things), and I would love to provide her an opportunity to sew home decor textiles and clothing which she really enjoys to do. I would love to sell homemade products made from organic fabrics.<br/>My father is a self-learned carpenter (among other things) and I would love to create an opportunity for him to produce and fix furniture which he is really good at.<br/>I also have 4 sisters and all of them are very artistic and would love to create decorations and jewelry to sell in the store. All of them are also lovers of vintage clothing and furniture and we would all be so happy to create a family business that we would all enjoy working in. <br/><br/>Opening a Vintage shop would be a dream come true for me and my family.<br/>We are a crafty family and we love it :)<br/>Most of all, it would allow me to earn a living for myself, because it's very hard to find employment in our small community.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every business has it's risks and challenges. Even though I have a lot of experience in sale, I still can't be 100% sure that I will provide all the products that the potential customers need or like.<br/>I will however do my best to listen to the customers and to be attuned to their needs so that I can adapt everything based on their feedback.</p>

<h3>Summary of the Engine Project</h3>
<p>U.S. industry consumes $100 billion worth of heat energy every year, largely in fossil fuels, and most of that energy just goes up the chimney.  There are 500,000 industrial stacks throwing off heat and pollution around America.  What if that wasted heat could be used as fuel to create electricity?  What if U.S. manufacturers could make enough electricity from their own waste heat to run their company plant; to light, heat and cool its offices; and produce extra electricity to feed into the grid to power homes and commercial buildings?  A pretty effective way to keep electricity independent, clean, efficient and inexpensive.<br/><br/>That is what we are working toward, and it could change everything for the American and world economy.  Basically, waste heat energy is free, since it would just be lost to the atmosphere.  The problem is that the most efficient heat engine to date, the Stirling engine, is still dropping a sizable portion of that available heat energy.<br/><br/>As a sculptor and as a problem solver, I'm comfortable working with complex forms– when I realized that the Stirling engine (the acknowledged cutting edge of engine efficiency) was throwing away a sizable portion of its energy – I set out to discover the reason why.  The human mind can only handle about three factors at a time, meaning that, if this complex problem in thermodynamics – involving temperature, pressure, the three dimensions of volume, entropy, fluid density, as well as an array of cycling characteristics, the flow rate, and the inertia of the mechanisms – was to be understood, I needed to establish a very complex, yet flexible, infrastructure of parameters and distill them down to a simple mechanism.  Ten years down the road, I have secured patents and built a working Soony engine prototype which promises a 20% leap in efficiency over state-of-the-art Stirling engines.<br/><br/>We are developing the most efficient reciprocating engine on the planet, and it will convert everyday heat into electricity.  Soony Systems, Inc., was established as an outgrowth of the thermodynamic discoveries surrounding the Soony cycle and near adiabatic engine.  The University of Maryland is poised to work on this project, and we are building a company to promote waste heat management that will utilize this engine.  Many companies have already provided expertise and components during the construction of the prototype -- including heat exchanger experts, seal experts, fitting experts, as well as milling machinists and fabricators.  With more than 20 related patents or patents pending, our company is exploring industrial sources and ways to integrate my breakthrough into a number of clean, energy-saving applications.  As a graduate in architecture from Georgia Institute of Technology with a strong background in math and geometry, I received a DOE Appropriate Energy Technology Small Grant (proposal #81-DC-0013-P-30,524) in 1981 to design and build a solar energy circulatory system, the embryonic stage of this breakthrough. Since then, while simultaneously pursuing my career as a sculptor, I have sought to design and achieve the most efficient Combined Heat to Power (CHP) engine in existence.<br/><br/>Despite the personal cost to me in time and money, the immeasurable good that this engine can do has kept me going.  The Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Maryland has come on board, and in conjunction with Maryland Industrial Partnership (MIPS) will be working with us to develop the Soony Engine.  The partnership grant will allow us to conduct thorough testing and to refine the design into an Alpha prototype.  But MIPS funding also requires 10% cost sharing.  A vast majority of our funds have gone into securing domestic and international patents to protect this technology so that we can grow the company in America and provide jobs in the United States, setting an example for growth globally.  While securing the patents equity has been expensive and continues to drain our small budget, the bench prototype that was developed on a shoe-string has attracted the interest of several highly respected UMD experts who believe in the Soony technology and want to participate in bringing this highly efficient clean energy heat engine to the market.  So your help is essential.  Your contribution will have a phenomenal impact on the energy future in America and the world.<br/><br/>I don't expect you to give without a fair exchange.  As a sculptor, I have an inventory of artwork, see <a href=""http://www.sculptorjohnston.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sculptorjohnston.com</a> and can offer you a wide array of bronze sculptures, including those pieces listed as perks.  You can peruse through my website <a href=""http://www.sculptorjohnston.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sculptorjohnston.com</a> and, if you find another work that interests you more and that particular piece is available, we can work something out.  Even if you yourself don’t have the means to contribute, you may know someone who does and can grasp this vision. Indiegogo Share Tools are designed to reach out to potential contributors.  Take a moment to pass this on to a friend or colleague – it could be the best idea you ever give them.</p>

U.S. industry consumes $100 billion worth of heat energy every year, largely in fossil fuels, and most of that energy just goes up the chimney.  There are 500,000 industrial stacks throwing off heat and pollution around America.  What if that wasted heat could be used as fuel to create electricity?  What if U.S. manufacturers could make enough electricity from their own waste heat to run their company plant; to light, heat and cool its offices; and produce extra electricity to feed into the grid to power homes and commercial buildings?  A pretty effective way to keep electricity independent, clean, efficient and inexpensive.That is what we are working toward, and it could change everything for the American and world economy.  Basically, waste heat energy is free, since it would just be lost to the atmosphere.  The problem is that the most efficient heat engine to date, the Stirling engine, is still dropping a sizable portion of that available heat energy.As a sculptor and as a problem solver, I'm comfortable working with complex forms– when I realized that the Stirling engine (the acknowledged cutting edge of engine efficiency) was throwing away a sizable portion of its energy – I set out to discover the reason why.  The human mind can only handle about three factors at a time, meaning that, if this complex problem in thermodynamics – involving temperature, pressure, the three dimensions of volume, entropy, fluid density, as well as an array of cycling characteristics, the flow rate, and the inertia of the mechanisms – was to be understood, I needed to establish a very complex, yet flexible, infrastructure of parameters and distill them down to a simple mechanism.  Ten years down the road, I have secured patents and built a working Soony engine prototype which promises a 20% leap in efficiency over state-of-the-art Stirling engines.We are developing the most efficient reciprocating engine on the planet, and it will convert everyday heat into electricity.  Soony Systems, Inc., was established as an outgrowth of the thermodynamic discoveries surrounding the Soony cycle and near adiabatic engine.  The University of Maryland is poised to work on this project, and we are building a company to promote waste heat management that will utilize this engine.  Many companies have already provided expertise and components during the construction of the prototype -- including heat exchanger experts, seal experts, fitting experts, as well as milling machinists and fabricators.  With more than 20 related patents or patents pending, our company is exploring industrial sources and ways to integrate my breakthrough into a number of clean, energy-saving applications.  As a graduate in architecture from Georgia Institute of Technology with a strong background in math and geometry, I received a DOE Appropriate Energy Technology Small Grant (proposal #81-DC-0013-P-30,524) in 1981 to design and build a solar energy circulatory system, the embryonic stage of this breakthrough. Since then, while simultaneously pursuing my career as a sculptor, I have sought to design and achieve the most efficient Combined Heat to Power (CHP) engine in existence.Despite the personal cost to me in time and money, the immeasurable good that this engine can do has kept me going.  The Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Maryland has come on board, and in conjunction with Maryland Industrial Partnership (MIPS) will be working with us to develop the Soony Engine.  The partnership grant will allow us to conduct thorough testing and to refine the design into an Alpha prototype.  But MIPS funding also requires 10% cost sharing.  A vast majority of our funds have gone into securing domestic and international patents to protect this technology so that we can grow the company in America and provide jobs in the United States, setting an example for growth globally.  While securing the patents equity has been expensive and continues to drain our small budget, the bench prototype that was developed on a shoe-string has attracted the interest of several highly respected UMD experts who believe in the Soony technology and want to participate in bringing this highly efficient clean energy heat engine to the market.  So your help is essential.  Your contribution will have a phenomenal impact on the energy future in America and the world.I don't expect you to give without a fair exchange.  As a sculptor, I have an inventory of artwork, see www.sculptorjohnston.com and can offer you a wide array of bronze sculptures, including those pieces listed as perks.  You can peruse through my website www.sculptorjohnston.com and, if you find another work that interests you more and that particular piece is available, we can work something out.  Even if you yourself don’t have the means to contribute, you may know someone who does and can grasp this vision. Indiegogo Share Tools are designed to reach out to potential contributors.  Take a moment to pass this on to a friend or colleague – it could be the best idea you ever give them.
 
This is the ""Millennium Medal,"" 3"" in diameter, available as a perk for $150

This medal is designed to stimulate reflection by looking at the relationship of ""conscience and consciousness."" The obverse side, ""conscience,"" is represented by a female figure nurturing the core of her being, her inner world. From her center is born a deep inner knowing or conscience, where lies the heart of human awareness. This circle, also representing the earth, becomes a portal to the reverse side of the medal which addresses ""consciousness"" -- a greater awareness of our responsibilities to ourselves, others, and the world about us.
 
 
This is the ""Nurtured Nurturer,"" 3"" in diameter, available as a perk for $180



This is a two-sided medal of a Mother and child. After seeing the sensual female figure, the reverse side surprises the viewer with a loving mother embracing her child. This affordable gift is perfect for Mother's Day and for recognition of motherhood and childbirth.
 
 
This is the ""Little Romantic Notion,"" a bronze, 12.5"" x 8.5"" x 4"" for $3800



The height of romantic humor, a naked knight grabs his yearning damsel and carries her off to his castle so as to live happily ever after.
 
 
This is ""Wedlock,"" bronze 26"" x 8"" x 5.5"" available as a perk for $6500



This is the original maquette for the 19.5' bronze commissioned for the entrance of Lafayette Center in Washington, D.C.  Conceived vertically, it compels alignment and unity. At the core, a merger of extended arms captures a broad embrace, transferring energy inward and outward. The female, although physically supporting the male, is effortless as if the two are floating in space.
 
 
This is the ""Bather,"" bronze, 18.5"" x 17"" x 8.5"", available for $7000



As if a sun goddess, the ""Bather"" flinges her hair from out of the ocean with sensual vigor as she raises her face to the heavens.
 
 
This is the ""DNA Maypole,"" bronze 39.5"" x 14"" x 11.5"" for $9000



Suggesting a parallel between the double helix of a DNA and the spiraling Maypole as a fertility symbol, the descending couple joins hands and reaches down into the upward spiraling genetic pool of children.
 
This is the ""King Lear,"" bronze 25"" x 24"" x 6"" available for $9000

King Lear staggers through a raging storm, his cape flying wildly in the wind.  After having rejected his loving daughter Cornelia, he tragically realizes the consequences of his foolish alliance with his conniving older daughters.
 
 
This is the ""Virgilance,"" bronze 23"" x 12"" x 9"" available for $9000
She sits firm and vigilant, bearing the wisdom of experience - a judicious caretaker of the sword of strength. Vigilance guards against incursions, preserves her gains and remains cooly ready for the next battle. No longer young, her flesh shows as much the effect of gravity as her demeanor illustrates her gravitas.
 
 
This is the ""Ballerina,"" bronze 32"" x 42"" x 18"" available for $10000

Fully extended in a forward lunge, this piece was inspired by an instantaneous moment seen years earlier in the Broadway production, Dance. The gesture is strong from every view.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

What Is It About?
The Smart Lid is
about Creating Awareness: For You, For Your Children & The Elderly.
 
What Is The Smart Lid?
Smart Lids are heat
sensitive color changing disposable beverage lids.
Smart Lids turn
bright red with heat. Smart Lids change back to dark colour as your drink
cools. A visual indicator that your drink may be hot (or above 118oF). Patented
sealing indicator shows lid attached properly.
 The Smart Lid has been recognized
the world-over for its innovative occupational health and safety features
including Occupational Health & Safety New Product of the Year Award.
 
The Hot Coffee Problem
We all know coffee can be hot, but accidents and
spillages still happen. 
How do you know your drink is hot without
trying it?
We set out to find a simple solution: THE SMART
LID
 The Smart Lid has been retooled
from bottom up to have a clean ergonomic design while maximizing structural
integrity, stackability and ease of use to place on a hot beverage while still
being able to drink through the lid.
 
The Smart Lid Solution – How It
Works
Place the heat sensitive smart lid on your
drink and it changes colour to bright red, indicating when your coffee is hot
enough to burn. The Smart Lid creates
awareness that contents may be hot and decreasing the chance of lid being
applied incorrectly.
 All hot beverage drinkers having different heat tolerances, current lids and cups leave coffee drinkers no option but to test the coffee temperature with their mouth
The rewards above are solely based on Indiegogos' built-in Referrals Contest data collected using their tracking systems. More information at Indiegogo Support
What They Are Saying About Us
Psfk – “This helps drinkers avoid unnecessary
mouth and hand burns.”
CNET – “Smart Lid silently screams, 'Hot
coffee!'”
Ubergizmo – “be more careful whenever we
see a red colored lid”
Trend Hunter – “Having come across this
piece years earlier would have saved me a lot of burnt tongue incidents.”
 All materials used in the
production of the Smart Lid comply with the following direct food-contact
regulations: USA - Food and Drug Administration FDA CFR 21; Europe - Council of
Europe Committee of Ministers Resolution AP(89).

Our Story
The Smart Lid journey was born 12 years ago
when a father and two sons wanted to reinvent how all daily coffee drinkers
enjoyed their hot beverage. 
We owned and operated local cafes in Sydney,
Australia, and wished to offer customers a coffee lid that warned of the hot
contents. 
This dream ignited the passion for a better
designed coffee lid, one that turned bright red as heat was applied, and one
which returned to the ‘cold’ colour as your drink cooled.
 Based in Sydney, Australia, we have
honed our specialty in heat sensitive technology for disposable containers over
many years of R&D and testing.
Everyone we spoke to in the industry said we
were trying to design a product that was technically not possible. After 12
years of research, we have gone through countless prototypes to perfect a set
of ‘cold’ and ‘hot’ colours that make all coffee drinkers say ‘WOW’, we have
the technical and production backing of Australia’s largest coffee lid
manufacturer, we have received direct food-contact compliance, we have Granted
patents, and along the way we have won 8 international awards for innovation
and design.
 
Consumer Adaptation
Bringing the Smart Lid to USA coffee
drinkers and major retailers.
Six months ago our first production run
occurred for commercial quantity distribution to cafes in Australia. 
As the weeks went by the biggest response we
received came from coffee drinkers who wanted the Smart Lid for their home,
their office and for use around elderly family members. 
The Smart Lid has received a lot of
international media attention and as a result we are asked everyday, mainly
from the USA and from Europe, how daily coffee drinkers can get their hands on
the Smart Lid.

decreases in scald times. Source: American Burn Association.
A successfully funded project will allow us to
bring the Smart Lid to the USA and European markets in the form of consumer
bundles, Smart Lids and cups in one package. Perfect for use at home, in the
office, or for use around elderly family members.

<li>CHARGIC has to be versatile enough to provide the most convenient charging experiences.

<li>CHARGIC has to be powerful enough and take advantage of GaN technology to cut down the charging time. So now we can proudly announce that CHARGIC is the world’s first GaN charger that capable of quick charging 3 laptops at the same time.<br/> </li>

</div></div>","Have you ever experienced these frustrating problems?
1.Every smart device has a different charger and they always seem to end up in a big tangled mess of cables and charging bricks making it difficult to find what you need. 
2.Lack of a convenient portable option to replace bulky laptop wall charger. 
3.Different countries have different plugs and you need to carry extra converters and adapters while traveling.  
4.USB-C is becoming a standard for smart devices, but you find yourself needing a charger with more USB-C ports for future devices. 
 
Now, all of those problems are solved with CHARGIC - the smallest yet most powerful 100W or 65W GaN charge with 3 USB-C & 1 USB-A ports, capable of quick charging up to 3 laptops simultaneously or charging 4 smart devices of any kind at the same time. Small enough to be carried anywhere, CHARGIC is the only charger you need.  
 
The Amazing 2020 iPad Pro & The New MacBook Air Just Released!! Let's Charge 3X Faster With  CHARGIC!! 
 CHARGIC can charge your smart devices faster and charge your ""Apple Package"" at the same time! 

 
 

 
 
 
 100W Fast Charging Is The New Standard 
100W CHARGIC supports USB-C with 100W output and can fully charge MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) which requires 96W of power supply. It is the next-generation high-power charger that you need now, and in the future.   
 
Quick Charging 3 MacBooks Simultaneously
CHARGIC comes with 3 USB-C ports, supporting PD protocols and smart power splitting which is a first in the world. A single 100W CHARGIC can charge 3 MacBook laptops at fast speed simultaneously.  

 

 


Charging 4 Different Devices Simultaneously
Intelligent AI Power MCU (microcontroller unit) ensures fast charging speeds, as well as stable power distribution for all 4 devices that are plugged in. It is the ultimate charger to power-up all your different smart devices at the same time.  
 
Support for Multiple Phone Charging Protocols
There are many different charging protocols for iPhone and Android phones. CHARGIC can support all fast-charging protocols to ensure that your device charges at the fastest safe speed.

Why 65W CHARGIC
The affordable 65W CHARGIC is the best value for your money available on the market today. It is compact, reliable and powerful for creators, designers, photographers and anyone who need to quickly charge multiple pieces of equipment at the same time. 
 
Equally Powerful But Smaller
Both 100W & 65W CHARGIC offer you the ultimate value for connectivity, compatibility, and most importantly versatility. But the 65W version is much smaller, just about the same size as an AirPods case. It can quickly charge most smart devices at their maximum speed with the exception of laptops.  
 
 
 Just slightly larger than the 65W version, the 100W CHARGIC is about the same size as a cigarette pack. Both are smaller than any other chargers of the same output standard on the current market. Save more space in your bag or luggage while still enjoying lightning-fast charging.  
 
 
 
One Charger, Charges All
CHARGIC supports almost all electronic devices' fast charge protocols. It is the only charger that you need to charge all of your devices.   
 
 
Powered by Navitas GaNFast Tech
Both 100W and 65W CHARGIC use an advanced Navitas GaN chip. This high-end chip is exclusively made for CHARGIC. The compact, lightweight and space-saving chip allows for a smaller, more convenient form factor. GaN technology represents the next generation of power technology and CHARGIC is the only charger you need to step into the future.  
 Safety Is No.1 Priority
With an intelligent safety temperature control chip built-in, CHARGIC delivers optimal quick charging for all smart devices, with protections against overloads, overvoltage, over-temperature, and short circuits to keep you and your electronics safe. 

 
 
 CHARGIC’s convertible and foldable pin design supports 110V to 240V worldwide voltages, which can be used everywhere in the world. So for all professionals who travel or creators who need a quick boost on their equipment, CHARGIC is the only charger needed for work or leisure.  
 
 
 Choosing between the 65W & 100W CHARGIC is easy. Here is how:  
The 65W CHARGIC is perfect for creators, designers, students or for all consumers who are using several electronic devices.  
 
The 100W CHARGIC will be your handy tool in a group working environment, where 3 laptops can be charged with only one charger. Or use the 100W CHARGIC to charge up your more energy-intensive devices like gaming laptops.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
The idea behind the whole project is simple, perhaps I would say straight forward. We want to create a product that could provide values to all CHARGIC users.

<p>Add a description or tagline of what your project or film is about, and specify what cast and crew you have, or are in need of. Once your project is posted other users can see it, if someone is interested in a certain position they can send you a notification or contact request. Then it's up to you, if you think that person is an ideal candidate to be your director, you can accept his notification and bam! your film now has a director. </p>

In early March, Tina and Grayson Haver Currin were on their way to pick up lumber when they spotted a group of protestors holding hateful signs outside of a women's clinic. They had an idea: Why not playfully counter-protest the protestors and distract them from yelling at the people headed inside? They began to document their activities on their blog, Saturday Chores. 
In June, the counter-protest went viral, prompting pieces in the Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, Cosmopolitan, Elle, and Yahoo News. Since then, dozens of friends and allies have joined them on Saturday morning. But it hasn't been all fun and games.  What We Need & What You Get
 Working in concert with the clinic director, the goal of Saturday Chores has always been to deflect the negative attention of anti-abortion protestors away from the people who need to use the services of the clinic. 
However, given recent media attention, the anti-abortionists have responded in kind. Their numbers, as well as their signage, have grown alongside Saturday Chores. Women are being called murderers. Men are being accosted outside.
To counteract this, Tina, Grayson, and the Saturday Chores crew plan to install approximately 80 feet of privacy fencing and landscaping along the property line of the clinic. This barrier between the protestors and the clinic will afford folks the privacy to which they're entitled.  
Initial estimates for wooden fencing, fifteen 6' Green Giant Arborvitae trees, plus water drip and mulching, is approximately $2000. The SC crew will spend a Saturday (or three) installing the screen, and probably holding up some funny signs, too. 
Goals for the privacy screen:

As much visual privacy and sound blocking for clinic front door, parking area and drive as possible
Solution should last for many years without replacement
Long-term maintenance requirements should be minimal or none
Solution should not be uninviting to clients

Solution needs to meet the needs of security at clinic



For a donation of $30 or more, you'll receive your choice of either a ""Weird Hobby"" or an ""I Like Turtles"" t-shirt, modeled after two of our original signs. Hand-screened in Raleigh, NC on American Apparel Ts, these soft shirts will show the world that you can do some good while also having a laugh.

</ul><br/><p></p><h3>Why IndieGOGO and LIFEENERGY?</h3><p>I am really passionate in integrating mind and matter. Everything in life for me need to be align with the nature. That is why is essential to take care of the thoughts and behavior patterns, health food and lifestyles. Easiest thing for developing those is to have some sort discipline as morning walking, yoga, meditations and non-ego community activities.</p><p>At first it seems very hard to implement same qualities in business model. But at the end or at least once you realize - it is MORE EASIER to SHARE, GIVE and be OPEN then to take, care only for profit and be closed for others as 'competition threat' and 'there is not enough for everybody' way of thinking. </p><p>That is why I recognized fundraising platform as really best way to:</p><ul>
<li>introduce the products to USA market and investigate DOES REALLY market (read YOU) desire it</li>
<li>get some additional funds for us to reduce investment risk and shipping costs which results in lower product price for YOU at the end</li>
<li>get customers (YOU) even before product launch without expensive marketing which again results in lower product price for YOU</li>
<li>get community driven sharing if found it GOOD and useful</li>
<li>and finally to GIVE MORE then everybody expect to those who recognized me, LIFEENERGY way and this community style marketing</li>
</ul><br/><p></p>
<h3>Who is behind?</h3><p>I was born in Croatia, Europe. Very beautiful country to live in as there is powerful nature, cost and islands, clean water and air, lots of forest and national parks. </p><p>I studied IT and gained Bachelor degree. That is why it was easy for me to start my own web-shop (before 7 years) in Croatia. At that time I was already in the Buddha like state of mind for years but only when this mindset went into the business started to expanded.</p><p>Currently I am operating in Croatia and whole Europe with more then 15 appliances. And for that I have help of my complete family. Check us at <a href=""http://shop.larimarcode.com/us/lifeenergy-team"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://shop.larimarcode.com/us/lifeenergy-team/</a></p><p>As I came to USA to do the same - I need you to recognize LIFEENERGY USA and make some FUN together :)</p><p><br/></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We are really enthusiastic about raw food and healthy diet.

Why IndieGOGO and LIFEENERGY?I am really passionate in integrating mind and matter. Everything in life for me need to be align with the nature. That is why is essential to take care of the thoughts and behavior patterns, health food and lifestyles. Easiest thing for developing those is to have some sort discipline as morning walking, yoga, meditations and non-ego community activities.At first it seems very hard to implement same qualities in business model. But at the end or at least once you realize - it is MORE EASIER to SHARE, GIVE and be OPEN then to take, care only for profit and be closed for others as 'competition threat' and 'there is not enough for everybody' way of thinking. That is why I recognized fundraising platform as really best way to:
introduce the products to USA market and investigate DOES REALLY market (read YOU) desire it
get some additional funds for us to reduce investment risk and shipping costs which results in lower product price for YOU at the end
get customers (YOU) even before product launch without expensive marketing which again results in lower product price for YOU
get community driven sharing if found it GOOD and useful
and finally to GIVE MORE then everybody expect to those who recognized me, LIFEENERGY way and this community style marketing

Who is behind?I was born in Croatia, Europe. Very beautiful country to live in as there is powerful nature, cost and islands, clean water and air, lots of forest and national parks. I studied IT and gained Bachelor degree. That is why it was easy for me to start my own web-shop (before 7 years) in Croatia. At that time I was already in the Buddha like state of mind for years but only when this mindset went into the business started to expanded.Currently I am operating in Croatia and whole Europe with more then 15 appliances. And for that I have help of my complete family. Check us at http://shop.larimarcode.com/us/lifeenergy-team/As I came to USA to do the same - I need you to recognize LIFEENERGY USA and make some FUN together :)What We Need & What You GetWe are really enthusiastic about raw food and healthy diet. As in Europe we are already selling Hurom and Greenis juicers we can say that those two products are completely the same in quality, longevity, design and functionality.Therefore we have ALREADY decided to go with the Greenis in USA market as soon as possible. But also we want YOU to be part of it and share the market with us. More perks we collect - more funds for order and more happy customer at the end.
only 5000$ we set for project goal since we have the funds for initial order. However all of your funds additionally goes to raise the quantity of our first order ergo reduce total cost per unit which makes all of us happy
all the funds raised here goes ONLY to the supplier and shipping company - not a cent goes to marketing or partnerships - YOU ARE OUR partners in that
take a look at our unique perks value we created for you:


RESERVATION of DISCOUNTif you don't like to put too much money there is only 25$ and 50$ perks for DOUBLE of the discount value once Greenis juicers arrived still at low cost

RESERVATION of GREENIS JUICERif you are fully relaxed about us and product itself, you KNOW and TRUST us and Greenis juicer quality (with 12 years of warranty) - perk us NOW and you can get it for really low price as 170$ or even 4 units for 600$

We like and make a strong commitment to develop long term relationship with the ones who recognizes our energy and motivation. Lets do it together!
Why to participate?Mixing your own juices, from time to time or even better few times through the day, gives you only joy and piece for your body and mind.Whether you like fruits or vegetables, mix it or even add nuts and berries - with lemon or ginger, mint or spices - you will find it so tasty and colorful in your daily life.More and more people start to feed with only vegetables without cooking it - more impact we all have on our environment. Without weird process of growing the vegetables for feeding the animals (spending tons of water and tons of pesticides) only for a reason to kill them at the end and eat. All the proteins and other things animals producing (with support of additional modern intoxication) humans can do the same from healthy, organic vegetables - like animals in nature.So why not to change our habits and change the world.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a professor at Judson University who has lived over seas for 18 years while being involved taking students on multiple service projects into African countries. Now that I'm involved with college students, I find their passion for changing the world more invigorating than almost anything I have experienced! But their passion needs direction.</p>
<p>This project to Sierra Leone is designed to channel their enthusiasm in a way that transforms both them and the impoverished children and familes of schools and villages of Sierra Leone. Our plan is to take the solar powered lights (two different designs) for the African kids and families to use at school and home because studies have shown that increased access to light will provide greater reading and study, thereby raising educational levels across the board. Greater education means a better quality of life! It's not rocket science...although, it may lead some African child to that!</p>
<p>The second item we will take is a personal water straw that eliminates virtually all of the microorganisms that may exist in their water. Each straw can be used over and over, and this simple device can help eliminate a far-too-common cause of death in Afirca - diarrhea. Again, this simple life-saving tool will enhance their quality of life.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $15,000 to provide the two types of solar lights and the clean water straws for Sierra Leone schools and villages while assisting in travel funds for the college students to get there. Each US student is providing over 50% of their own travel costs.</p>
<p>Perks for YOU:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single Pack funding: We will offer a heart-felt THANK YOU note from one of the college team members. </li>
<li>Multi-pack funding: We will send you a photo of our group in Sierra Leone signed by each participant.</li>
<li>Stuffed Pack funding: We will send you a photo of a child and/or family with the lights or straws.</li>
<li>Sponsor Pack funding: We will send you a signed appreciation letter by the school principal or village leader of Sierra Leone.</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter what the level of funding, all of the lights and straws that are funded will be taken directly to Sierra Leone by the group (or by me personally).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><em>Over the past 30 years, I have taken thousands of students on service projects to former eastern bloc countries as well as Haiti and Africa, but this is the first time I have utilized new technology like the lights and water straw to offer significant quality of life changes for familes, schools and villages. Inspired students will participate in a lifetime of creative life enhancements for the impoverished peoples of the world.</em></p>

<p><b>Who is Domácí
Management LLC?</b></p>
<p>Domácí simply means
home. Realizing the decline in the availability safe, clean and affordable housing
in Baltimore City, Domácí Management, LLC was created.  Life-long residents of the city realized that
the community as they knew it, has faded away. 
There were far too many vacancies (over 60,000 to be exact), yet the
demand for affordable housing is increasing. 
</p>
<p>Re-gentrification attracts
big residential developers to come and replace these vacancies with luxury houses
at luxury prices, which would further drive out moderately income families.  With the average medium income for families
in Baltimore City only being $40,000 +/- <sup>1</sup>, the cost of suitable
rentals have become far out of range.  </p>
<p>According to <a href=""http://www.city-data.com/county/Baltimore_city-MD.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.city-data.com/county/Baltimore_city-MD.html</a>,
the average rent in the city for a two bedroom is over $1,200 <sup>2</sup>.  This is a challenge for most working
families in Baltimore.  If you are working,
and fortunate to fall in that category of $40,000, you may not qualify for
subsidy housing vouchers, which would offset some of that $1,200.  </p>
<p>Our solution, take advantage of the amble
supply of vacant houses within the city limits. 
Purchase as many as we can while the housing market is still low in the
city, fully rehabilitate/renovate using quality, yet cost effective
materials, then rent the properties at below market-rate.  </p>
<p>This would in turn provide affordable housing
without the burden falling on the city to provide such housing needs, while
revitalizing desolate/dying communities and creating several new employment
opportunities within the company.  </p>

<h4>The first-ever 60W-incandescent, 800 lumen-class, dimmable, replacement (beware of ""compatible"") bulb to crack $10 pricing – AND, it’s AMERICAN-made<br/>
</h4>
<p>Born of Silicon Valley innovation and scaling, military and aerospace ruggedness, and highly-efficient and low-cost automated manufacturing, the dimmable 2D-Lite LED Disk delivers the innovation, high quality, and reliability expected of an American made product – yet at a market-leading price point that's 30% lower than most reputable competitors, and more than 60% less than the average price of 60W incandescent-replacement, 800 lumen class, LED bulbs, today. Ten bucks.</p>
<p><b>FOR THE REST OF THE CAMPAIGN, WE'RE OFFERING 8 OF THE 2D-LIGHT LED DISKS FOR $79.99. SEE THE PERKS FOR DETAILS.</b><br/></p>
<p>The 2D-Lite LED Disk being introduced here on Indiegogo is the first member of NliteN inc's 2D-Light™ LED Disk product family, which can be readily recognized by their very unusual, patent pending, flat disk design. A 23rd century lighting design, now.<br/></p>
<h3>2D-Light™ LED Disk Technology<br/>
</h3>
<p>A 60W incandescent light bulb replacement using low toxicity, energy saving, long life, dimmable LED technology, that's design-optimized for extremely low cost, and high volume manufacturing, while retaining the high reliability and quality expected of an American made and designed product.</p>
<p>The flat 2D-Light LED ""Disk"" screws into a standard ""E26"" 60-W light socket and reduces energy consumption by about 80% over incandescent, and 30% over CFL, bulbs.  Yes, i<b>t goes into a standard US light socket</b> (international is coming)<br/></p>
<p>It not only specifies lumens, it DELIVERS the lumens due to its novel, patent-pending, design that places the LED light source at a point, making the light seem brighter than other LED or CFL bulbs, even ones that claim to be omniirectional.<br/></p>

are going to have a very hard time getting to $10 and below, because we know
where the costs are and we’ve patented the way to get those costs out – as far
as we know, the ONLY way. We also know they are all freaking out right now, trying to figure out what to do, how not to lose money with each bulb they ship - they will.<br/></span></p>

The first-ever 60W-incandescent, 800 lumen-class, dimmable, replacement (beware of ""compatible"") bulb to crack $10 pricing – AND, it’s AMERICAN-made

Born of Silicon Valley innovation and scaling, military and aerospace ruggedness, and highly-efficient and low-cost automated manufacturing, the dimmable 2D-Lite LED Disk delivers the innovation, high quality, and reliability expected of an American made product – yet at a market-leading price point that's 30% lower than most reputable competitors, and more than 60% less than the average price of 60W incandescent-replacement, 800 lumen class, LED bulbs, today. Ten bucks.
FOR THE REST OF THE CAMPAIGN, WE'RE OFFERING 8 OF THE 2D-LIGHT LED DISKS FOR $79.99. SEE THE PERKS FOR DETAILS.
The 2D-Lite LED Disk being introduced here on Indiegogo is the first member of NliteN inc's 2D-Light™ LED Disk product family, which can be readily recognized by their very unusual, patent pending, flat disk design. A 23rd century lighting design, now.
2D-Light™ LED Disk Technology

A 60W incandescent light bulb replacement using low toxicity, energy saving, long life, dimmable LED technology, that's design-optimized for extremely low cost, and high volume manufacturing, while retaining the high reliability and quality expected of an American made and designed product.
The flat 2D-Light LED ""Disk"" screws into a standard ""E26"" 60-W light socket and reduces energy consumption by about 80% over incandescent, and 30% over CFL, bulbs.  Yes, it goes into a standard US light socket (international is coming)
It not only specifies lumens, it DELIVERS the lumens due to its novel, patent-pending, design that places the LED light source at a point, making the light seem brighter than other LED or CFL bulbs, even ones that claim to be omniirectional.
----------
Sept 4, 2013 2D-Light low-cost LED Disk Press Release is here
Please let us know if you spot coverage of the 2D-Light™ LED Disks and where. So far:

""Although 
much more efficient and durable than the ordinary incandescent light 
bulbs, not to mention more sustainable, LED bulbs are still too 
expensive for the average customer...But now Oregon-based start-up 
NliteN has unveiled their new dimmable LED bulb that is just 2mm thick 
and costs only $9.99!"" -Lidija Grozdanic, Inhabitat
"" If NliteN’s disk-shaped 2D-Lite reaches production, however, it could make the Cree product look downright expensive."" -Ben Coxworth, Gizmag
""Can NliteN pull it off?  I'm told that Andy Turudic has a track record. 
The product is compelling, especially with its price targets."" -Keith Dawson, Allledlighting
""Mark it on your calendars, dear readers, for today is the day when the light bulb became obsolete"" -Beth Buczynski, Earthtechling
""...this
 may be the most unique and original approach to home lighting since 
Edison perfected the symbol for all bright ideas back in 1879."" -Stewart Wolpin, DVICE

""NliteN makes helping the environment as easy as changing a lightbulb."" -Rebecca Grant, Venturebeat 
""Designen på den nya LED-lampan skiljer sig radikalt från konkurrenterna"" [ The design of the new LED lamp is radically different from the competition ] -Per Henricsson, Elektronik Tidningen


""In
 manufacturing, 'flat' has long been synonymous with 'low-cost' but can 
this also be applied to consumer LED bulbs? The 2D-Light, dubbed as both
 a 'CFL Killer' and as a 'Light Bulb for the World,' gives it a go."" -Matt Hickman, Mother Nature Network





 =======================================
(note to the press and to bloggers:
Media kit for the 2D-Lite™, and 2D-Lux™, LED Disks are  available at http://2d-light.com/Media_Page_2.html
========================================

Our goal is to develop and produce the
lowest cost ($10 initially), dimmable, energy saving LED light bulb that can
replace the 60W incandescent and the 14W CFL 800 lumen bulbs, while maintaining
the highest possible quality that’s associated with an American made product.
Because of its “point source” light design, the 2D-Light LED Disk will appear
brighter than CFLs or LED bulbs in most applications.
We announced this Indiegogo campaign on
September 4, 2013, as the first $10 dimmable LED light that produces 800 lumens
and replaces the 60W incandescent. We know that the incumbent LED bulb makers
are going to have a very hard time getting to $10 and below, because we know
where the costs are and we’ve patented the way to get those costs out – as far
as we know, the ONLY way. We also know they are all freaking out right now, trying to figure out what to do, how not to lose money with each bulb they ship - they will.


(table courtesy of Margery Conner, designingwithleds.com)
We achieve low cost, without compromises, by throwing away the false constraint
that an LED light has to be a “bulb” - we collapse all of the essential components
into a patent-pending 2D LED lighting platform that simply uses a circuit
board, and in doing so we reap a lot of benefits in what we are calling “2D-Light
LED Disk technology”. 
We’ve cut out the heat sink completely, reduced labor and
assembly, simplified the LED driver IC and externals and reduced the LED
package count from about a dozen to two – you can see, about a 25~30% cost cut.
We can do this without compromises, in fact, with BENEFITS, because (sorry about the formatting - Indigogo is horrible for editing pages):• We
can use automated manufacturing methods that reduce cost and produce repeatable
quality production that can be done regionally:             • Initially made
in America        • Follow-on automated
production in the EU, Japan, Thailand (SE Asia) for those           markets• We
use surface mount components throughout, onto a monolithic substrate, which
makes for a very compact design that requires no connectors or wires as found
in all of the other LED “bulbs”       • This eliminates
the largest factors in poor reliability and product life – connector and wiring
failure lifetimes should
be significantly improved over other LED bulbs       • We can place
components on both sides of the circuit board, further increasing component
density       • This also allows
us to place the LEDs, & their lenses, on both sides      image courtesy
of General ElectricOur LEDs are placed at the center of the disk, the LCL, which is where ANSI standards specify as a POINT from which light MUST originate       • Most LED “bulbs” do not respect this point source location, but instead merely provide an omnidirectional source of light with an array of LEDs that are geometrically centered around the LCL              • This is NOT the same as a single point source of light              • These LED bulbs, and CFLs, will appear darker in parabolic fixtures like downlights and desk lamps         • The 2D-Light will appear brighter, lumen for lumen, than most other energy-saving bulbs

§  The 2D-Light LED
disk is a copper surface, which is used as a heat spreader an heat sink• There
is an non-contorted, direct, thermal path from the LED to the copper disk, unlike
the thermal path in many LED bulbs, especially ‘snocones”
• The
area of the disks on the front and back of the LED Disk is about the same as
the area of the aluminum heat sinks on other LED “bulbs”
2D-Light is
designed to ANSI standards for A-19 60W Bulbs and has a retro styling nod
·     
        The
shape of the circuit board also incorporates the threaded connections to the
light socket
        • The initial
threaded connections will be for the North American “E26” Edison Screw light
socket  • We then plan to also
do the E27 Edison Screw base for Japan and Europe  • We also plan to
support the GU24 energy saving base used in California  • And, finally, we’re
thinking about supporting the B22D bayonet lamp socket for the UK and its “colonies”·       

    LEDs
are not properly omnidirectional, but produce a “Lambertian” cone of light
       • We use a
correction lens to produce an almost perfect hemisphere of even light
distribution
       • With LEDs and
lenses on both sides of the circuit board, we produce two hemispheres, a sphere,
of even light distribution, which very few, if any LED lamps can do


·       
The
LED Disks will initially be available in a 3000K “warm white” color, with
2700K, 4000K and 5000K also available. You will be able to choose which you
want when the campaign closes – the higher, more white, color temperatures will
produce more lumens and are more efficient, which is why we say “800
lumen-class output”.
·       
We
use our own patent pending “constant resistance” LED driver architecture, and
did not settle for the standard silicon drivers that are out there
o          • This design will
naturally dim as voltage is varied, as with a wall dimmer
       • More
importantly, we allow electrical utilities to do energy management, by doing “load
shedding”
§            • This reduces the
need to build more coal plants to cover peak demand
              • This eliminates,
or reduced the frequency of, rolling blackouts
§                       • This can reduce
consumers’ electrical bills during peak demand, peak tariff, periods
·       

     We’ve
eliminated toxic materials in our energy saving LED Disks, such as the mercury neurotoxin
found in CFL bulbs
 
NliteN’s 2D-Light
LED Disks provide all of the advantages of energy saving bulbs, while producing
the highest quality of light, an omni-directional point source, and the highest
quality product at the levels expected of an American-made product

When developing it, we faced many challenges - we had to develop our own highly energy-efficient, reliable and affordable water valve, which took us a lot of time to perfect its functioning. The circuit had to be technologically advanced as well if we wanted it to save energy and be resistant to different temperatures and water. That is why the device underwent extensive product testing and practical application. A very big challenge was to prepare the product for production - to optimize the assembly speed for the product while keeping it at a high quality and affordable at the same time.

You can set the upper and the lower limits of humidity, the amount of liquid released during watering - from about 0.1 dl up to 300 liters (2 seconds - 8 hours) or select the Auto-detect function which uses an advanced algorithm to slowly add water while calculating how much water is needed for each watering. You can also choose whenever to water at night or during the day.Daisy.si is an extremely technologically sophisticated watering device, working up to 2 years of active use. It has a function that automatically turns it off when pulled out of the soil. Its power is drawn from two AAA batteries which are easily obtainable and replaceable.

Development of the Daisy.si itself lasted about 2 years. When developing it, we faced many challenges - we had to develop our own highly energy-efficient, reliable and affordable water valve, which took us a lot of time to perfect its functioning. The circuit had to be technologically advanced as well if we wanted it to save energy and be resistant to different temperatures and water. That is why the device underwent extensive product testing and practical application. A very big challenge was to prepare the product for production - to optimize the assembly speed for the product while keeping it at a high quality and affordable at the same time.

Pictures of prototypes:We are ready for the production of the Daisy.si watering devices. We agreed on a fixed price for  the plastic injection mold and we have a deal with the manufacturers of printed circuit boards for machine placement, soldering and painting of the printed circuit boards. We also acquired reliable and quality sources for our electronic components. The product is trialed and tested.At this point we really need your help. With the funds collected from contributions we will be able to acquire a large volume of top quality components, order plastic injection molds, start the production and supply the first series of Daisy.si devices at a reasonable price.With your support you will also contribute to further development of various products that we have ideas and plans on realizing - ideas for automation of plant cultivation. Daisy.si is only the first of many device.please follow us here.Andrej Nastran - leader and developer of the Daisy.si project, prototype author, valve closing system, electronicsPeter Nastran - inventor of the concept for plant watering, early prototypes

We are very well prepared for production. During the development process we made sure that the product would be easy to make, affordable and reliable. We have carefully calculated all costs and got the pro forma invoices from our electronic components suppliers. We are very well aware of our responsibility to do our best to deliver great results and a reliable product. We will constantly keep you informed about the progress of the products production and about any possible problems or delays.Thank you!If you have any question please send us a comment on the project page or email us to info@daisy.siIs the shipping cost included?Yes. The shipping and the EU tax are included in the price. In case of customs duties, the expenses are covered by you.Why does the final version not have solar cells anymore, like the prototype did?Solar cells are very expensive and so is a quality rechargeable battery. The solar cells worked out great on the prototype, but we think its implementation should wait for a while because of the production costs that would require a lot more orders to be able to make it.Why is it not possible to use Bluetooth to change the settings of the product?We were thinking about the possibility at the very beginning. It has some advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that Bluetooth would enable the setting and monitoring of more several more options. The disadvantage is that this would make the product more expensive since we would need to develop applications for iOS , Android , Windows Phone etc. Not to mention the shortened battery life. However, there still is a possibility that a future product would have BT support.Can water spill over the edge of the base?With the auto-detect function there is little chance that the water could spill unless if the base were to be extremely shallow. However, if you manually set an excessive amount of water, it will spill.Do you offer a warranty on the product?Of course. We guarantee a warranty to up to 2 years. (EU)Can the device be used outside ?Yes, Daisy.si is resistant to sun, rain and moisture.Where will the product be made and from where will it be sent ?The Daisy.si devices will be made in the EU. They will be sent from the EU.What happens if the container runs out of water?The Daisy.si registers that automatically after a few unsuccessful watering attempts and starts to warn us with sound and light signals. We resolve the alarm and empty container by refilling the it and/or manually watering the plant. The device will noticed our intervention and will turn off the alarm.Is this product patented?Yes, this product and solutions inside are patent pending.",44.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi.  We are Thanasis Zografos and Lazaros Agapides.  We're two guys who have an idea and a vision that we're passionate about.  <b>Our vision is to allow anyone to easily create a high quality free access wi-fi network of ANY size and to offer multiple services over that network that will add value as well as bring in revenue.</b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Wefrii uses wireless mesh technology as well as the wefrii cloud controller (WCC) that allows you to easily manage the whole network online.  OK, we admit, there are already such solutions out there.  Actually, we've even used and installed some of the most popular cloud controlled wireless mesh networks in the world, but what we found is that the cloud controller was <b>seriously lacking in features and services. </b> What's different about wefrii?  Well, the most innovative part of wefrii is <b>the additional services wefrii provides and the way that they are offered</b> over the network.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We’d
like to introduce you to our ""wefrii suite of services.“  This is a set of services that are integrated into the wefrii devices as well as the wefrii control panel.  These include (but are not limited to) basic internet access, wefrii wireless advertising, wefrii VPN, wefrii telephony as well as wefrii sensor grids.  The whole network, along with all of these services can easily be managed centrally and as one entity from the wefrii cloud controller.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/81625/files/20130918074856-wefrii-title6.gif?1379515736"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span><p></p>
<h3><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Wefrii Wireless Advertising</span></h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This service is an innovative way to provide free wireless internet access while at the same
time, advertising your business as well as other local businesses within or
near the range of your wi-fi network.  This
goes way beyond simple Internet advertising as it has a <b>targeted local
audience</b>.  The potential customers that
see your ad will literally be within walking distance to your location.  It’s what’s called hyper-local advertising.</span></p>
<h3>Wefrii VPN</h3>
<p>This service allows you to connect two or more of your locations via a secure VPN.  It doesn't matter where these locations are geographically.  They can be anywhere in the world.  The only prerequisite is that each location have at least one active wefrii point.  This is a very powerful service as it allows you to securely interconnect your company's applications such as invoicing and inventory databases as well as many other such applications.</p>
<h3><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Wefrii Telephony</span></h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With wefrii telephony you'll be able to enjoy IP telephony service on any wefrii network.  This way, you can easily fully integrate the telephony systems of many of your locations or create an internal telephony network.  If you offer a free network at a hotel, or within a municipality, you can add this as a value added service for your network users.</span></p>

<h3>Wefrii Sensor Grids</h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) is a concept that is quickly and inevitably becoming reality.  A major part of IoT is the collection, analysis and visualisation of sensor data as well as systems automation.  A wefrii network allows the seamless integration of wefrii sensor nodes where each node can support a number of sensors that can monitor up to 50 different values within the following categories: environment, smart cities, water, metering, smart buildings, building automation, logistics and eHealth.  These sensors send their data to the wefrii cloud controller which stores their historical values, displays their values in real time and creates heat maps and data visualisation for you to analyse and display your data.  We feel that t<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">his service is one of the most exciting, innovative and ambitious of the project. </span></p>
<h3><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Future Services</span></h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">By no means are we limiting the use of the wefrii network to the above services.  The truth is that only one's imagination is the limit.  That's why we want to build the wefrii cloud controller in a modular way so that additional services will be able to be added quickly and easily.  We're also relying on your ideas and input to prepare for future add-ons to the wefrii suite of services.  Some ideas that we want to keep in mind for the future are </span>video conferencing<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> services, video </span>surveillance<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, content filtering and others.</span></p>

<p>Below you will find some real world examples of wefrii in action.  Keep in mind that <b>all services described </b>are able to be managed centrally from the wefrii cloud controller, a web based control panel in the cloud that you can access from <b>anywhere!</b></p>
<p></p>
<h3><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Wefrii wireless advertising example</span></h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Let’s say you own three corner
stores in your town.  Each has a
broadband connection for your business use. 
Imagine you install a wefrii point at each of your locations offering
free wi-fi to the area around each store. 
You can easily configure these points so that any user connecting to
your network will see what’s called your “splash page,” a web page that you
design yourself to promote your products, services, your locations as well as
any special offers you may have on any particular day.  As people around your business locations
begin to use your network, they will all be informed of what you have to
offer.  Once they see your splash page,
they have the option of browsing through your site before they continue on to
the site of their choice.</span><br/></p>
<p>Imagine now that the businesses
across the street, your partners, or any other interested businesses in the
area ask you to advertise them on your splash page.  For a fee you can add them to your site and
make some money.  Or, even better, you
can ask them to install a wefrii point on their premises that will either
connect to their broadband connection or will mesh wirelessly via your
connection thereby creating a wireless advertising community in your
neighbourhood.  In this way, you as well
as the businesses in your area will increase the size of the wireless network,
and thereby increase the number of local people that will see your ads. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/69955/files/20130912094629-city.jpg?1379004389"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>This network then has the potential
to continue to grow as you add wefrii points at your home, your relative’s
homes and businesses, other businesses with which you cooperate and anywhere
else you have access to a broadband connection.  Because of the way that wireless mesh technology works, you can add wefrii points and have them mesh wirelessly with each other allowing multiple points within an area to connect via one broadband connection.  Such a network can grow endlessly offering free wi-fi along with high
quality hyper-local advertising.</p>
<p>You can further customize the splash
page so that depending on where the user is, different ads will show up or they
will show up in a different order.  If
you connect to the wefrii point near “Johnny’s Grocery Store” the first thing
you’ll see are today’s specials at Johnny’s. 
If you’re across the street at “Sam’s Meat Market,” you’ll see what’s on
sale at Sam’s first, and farther down you’ll see Johnny’s specials.  You can even customize what the user sees
based on the time of day or whether it’s a weekday or the weekend.  Customization and flexibility are key
features.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/69968/files/20130912095132-splash.jpg?1379004692"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond this, the potential applications
are endless.  Through wefrii points, restaurants
can promote their menus or sell their brand name products used in their
cooking.  Hotels can offer free wi-fi
while informing their customers of sightseeing services, room service, car
rental and tourist activities offered by the hotel and its partners.  Airports, hospitals and sports complexes will
benefit greatly by informing users of where they can go for refreshments, food,
emergency services and yes, even where to go when nature calls.  Malls and shopping centres will be able to
advertise all of their shops and services based on your location.  Municipal wi-fi can truly be free, viable and
sustainable by creating a business framework that is mutually beneficial for
local businesses, the citizens of cities and the municipalities
themselves.  </p>

<i></i><p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This is a simple example of a splash page that you will be able to create with our dashboard.  If the content is all Greek to you, don't worry, it really is in Greek!</i></p>

<p></p>
<p> With the addition of our mobi-wefrii option, that
is, mobile wefrii points, public transit buses, trains and tour buses can provide free wi-fi
access to travellers while informing all those connected of restaurants, stores and
services that exist at the next few stops.  In addition, one of our future stretch goals may be the development of a sati-wefrii point, an option that will allow wefrii points to connect via satellite.  These can be installed on ferry boats, airplanes as well as cruise ships to offer free wi-fi
while informing all users on board of food menus, duty free products,
entertainment programmes or specials on future tickets.</p>
<h3>Wefrii VPN Example</h3>
<p>Using the above scenario, at your central location, you are running a network service that is vital to your company, such as an inventory database.  When you sell an item at one of your other locations, you want that database to be updated in real time.  Wefrii VPN service allows you to do that.  Just by having one wefrii point at each of your locations and regardless of how these wefrii points connect to the Internet (either via their own broadband connection or via a wireless mesh) you have an almost zero configuration secure VPN service between your locations.  Essentially, as shown in the following diagram, you'll have a network that will allow you to run client server or peer to peer applications between your locations securely and reliably without any additional software whether you are using a wired or wireless connection to a wefrii point.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/92192/files/20130923225357-vpn_map.jpg?1380002037"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Note that the wefrii points don't have to be connected to each other directly.  You can have one wefrii point connected to your broadband connection and another one anywhere else in the world connected to another broadband connection and still create a successful VPN, and you can activate the VPN service from the wefrii cloud controller for whichever wefrii points you want.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Wefrii Telephony Example</h3>
<p>IP telephony and VoIP technologies are quickly moving from the cutting edge to the mainstream as more and more providers and businesses are adopting the technology.  Wefrii, however, comes to add a new dimention to voice services.  With wefrii, you'll be able to enjoy a service we call Voice over wefrii (VoW).  With this service, wefrii allows you to install one or more IP telephones anywhere there is a wefrii point: at your store locations and, with a mobi wefrii point, even on a tour bus! </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/100786/files/20130928060325-phone_map.jpg?1380373405"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>You'll be able to have free inter-location calling through the wefrii network, and, if you connect the network to a PSTN connection at one of your locations, you'll be able to enjoy external calling as well.  Additionally, you'll be able to connect any SIP client app to integrate your smartphone into the wefrii telephony services as well. </p>
<h3>Wefrii Sensor Grid Example</h3>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Hi.  We are Thanasis Zografos and Lazaros Agapides.  We're two guys who have an idea and a vision that we're passionate about.  Our vision is to allow anyone to easily create a high quality free access wi-fi network of ANY size and to offer multiple services over that network that will add value as well as bring in revenue.
Wefrii uses wireless mesh technology as well as the wefrii cloud controller (WCC) that allows you to easily manage the whole network online.  OK, we admit, there are already such solutions out there.  Actually, we've even used and installed some of the most popular cloud controlled wireless mesh networks in the world, but what we found is that the cloud controller was seriously lacking in features and services.  What's different about wefrii?  Well, the most innovative part of wefrii is the additional services wefrii provides and the way that they are offered over the network.
We’d
like to introduce you to our ""wefrii suite of services.“  This is a set of services that are integrated into the wefrii devices as well as the wefrii control panel.  These include (but are not limited to) basic internet access, wefrii wireless advertising, wefrii VPN, wefrii telephony as well as wefrii sensor grids.  The whole network, along with all of these services can easily be managed centrally and as one entity from the wefrii cloud controller.


Wefrii Wireless Advertising
This service is an innovative way to provide free wireless internet access while at the same
time, advertising your business as well as other local businesses within or
near the range of your wi-fi network.  This
goes way beyond simple Internet advertising as it has a targeted local
audience.  The potential customers that
see your ad will literally be within walking distance to your location.  It’s what’s called hyper-local advertising.
Wefrii VPN
This service allows you to connect two or more of your locations via a secure VPN.  It doesn't matter where these locations are geographically.  They can be anywhere in the world.  The only prerequisite is that each location have at least one active wefrii point.  This is a very powerful service as it allows you to securely interconnect your company's applications such as invoicing and inventory databases as well as many other such applications.
Wefrii Telephony
With wefrii telephony you'll be able to enjoy IP telephony service on any wefrii network.  This way, you can easily fully integrate the telephony systems of many of your locations or create an internal telephony network.  If you offer a free network at a hotel, or within a municipality, you can add this as a value added service for your network users.

Wefrii Sensor Grids
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that is quickly and inevitably becoming reality.  A major part of IoT is the collection, analysis and visualisation of sensor data as well as systems automation.  A wefrii network allows the seamless integration of wefrii sensor nodes where each node can support a number of sensors that can monitor up to 50 different values within the following categories: environment, smart cities, water, metering, smart buildings, building automation, logistics and eHealth.  These sensors send their data to the wefrii cloud controller which stores their historical values, displays their values in real time and creates heat maps and data visualisation for you to analyse and display your data.  We feel that this service is one of the most exciting, innovative and ambitious of the project. 
Future Services
By no means are we limiting the use of the wefrii network to the above services.  The truth is that only one's imagination is the limit.  That's why we want to build the wefrii cloud controller in a modular way so that additional services will be able to be added quickly and easily.  We're also relying on your ideas and input to prepare for future add-ons to the wefrii suite of services.  Some ideas that we want to keep in mind for the future are video conferencing services, video surveillance, content filtering and others.

Wefrii is based on wireless mesh technology. 
What we want to do is customize and optimize this technology for use with the wefrii suite of services.  Specifically, we want to further develop our network infrastructure as well as the services that will run on that network:
Network Infrastructure Development



The wefrii
point, a plug and play access point for the wefrii network


The mobi wefrii point, a device that will allow you to connect multiple wefrii points to the internet via a 3G or 4G (LTE) network and will offer GPS coordinates of its location in real time.


The exti wefrii point to point extender, a pair of devices that will allow you to extend your network over larger distances (thousands of metres) without the need of additional broadband connections.


The sensi wefrii sensor node, the device that will collect sensor data and send it to the wefrii control panel.


A future goal will be the addition of the sati wefrii point, a device that will allow you to connect several wefrii points to the Internet via a satellite internet connection for use on vehicles or in areas where other connections to the Internet are unavailable.



Wefrii Suite of Services Development


The wefrii cloud controller (WCC) is an easy to use web based dashboard that will allow you insert your wefrii devices of all types and to customize and monitor your
network.  From this easy to use interface, you'll be able to set up and manage all of your wefrii services as well.

The wefrii wireless advertising service allows you can configure your splash page and your location and time based advertising in an easy
and intuitive way.
Wefrii VPN, a service that allows you to interconnect several locations over a secure network.
Wefrii telephony, a telephony service you'll be able to use over your wireless network
Wefrii sensor grid, a service that allows you to collect sensor data from the wefrii sensor nodes, stores it and allows you to analyse and visualise it.


In short we want to develop a flexible and powerful product that you can easily install and configure yourself from which you, your company and your community will immediately benefit from.  You'll have all the guidelines, instructions and tech support you need from us to get the job done.


If you help us, we'll acknowledge your help in the most visible way.  You can see our perks on the right.  The more you contribute, the more you can take part in creating this new wi-fi reality.




You may not be able to contribute financially.  That's OK!  Even an encouraging message just to tell us that you share our vision would be awesome!  Keep in mind as well that there may be applications for wefrii that we just haven't thought of yet and we'd like to hear from  you about them!  Please let us know so we can add them to our ideas.
You don't need to donate money to be a contributor!  Even just liking our campaign on Facebook or letting others know about our vision is extremely valuable to us.



Thanassis is a mathematician with a IT degree in databases. For many years he has tought maths and programming languages, while working as a systems engineer. For the last six years he operates an IT company specialising in creating eshop platforms as well as custom software solutions for its customers.
Lazaros is a telecommunications professional with almost fifteen years of professional experience.  He has designed and installed high capacity municipal wi-fi networks and has substantial experience in voice and data network design in the telecommunications industry both in Greece and abroad.
A while back, Thanassis and Lazaros, who are next door neighbours, met at a wedding.  They began talking about what they do.  Things kind of came together and the idea of wefrii was born.  Unfortunately, due to lack of time and, more vitally, lack of funds, wefrii was unable to get off the ground.  Today, with a revamped plan, a more focused vision and a little bit of help from you, we're optimistic that wefrii will take off!
Stop right there!




Everything about this campaign above the STOP sign is enough for you to get a pretty good feeling of what we're up to.  If you are interested in obtaining a deeper understanding of more technical and logistical issues, then please keep reading.



Below you will find some real world examples of wefrii in action.  Keep in mind that all services described are able to be managed centrally from the wefrii cloud controller, a web based control panel in the cloud that you can access from anywhere!

Wefrii wireless advertising example
Let’s say you own three corner
stores in your town.  Each has a
broadband connection for your business use. 
Imagine you install a wefrii point at each of your locations offering
free wi-fi to the area around each store. 
You can easily configure these points so that any user connecting to
your network will see what’s called your “splash page,” a web page that you
design yourself to promote your products, services, your locations as well as
any special offers you may have on any particular day.  As people around your business locations
begin to use your network, they will all be informed of what you have to
offer.  Once they see your splash page,
they have the option of browsing through your site before they continue on to
the site of their choice.
Imagine now that the businesses
across the street, your partners, or any other interested businesses in the
area ask you to advertise them on your splash page.  For a fee you can add them to your site and
make some money.  Or, even better, you
can ask them to install a wefrii point on their premises that will either
connect to their broadband connection or will mesh wirelessly via your
connection thereby creating a wireless advertising community in your
neighbourhood.  In this way, you as well
as the businesses in your area will increase the size of the wireless network,
and thereby increase the number of local people that will see your ads. 



This network then has the potential
to continue to grow as you add wefrii points at your home, your relative’s
homes and businesses, other businesses with which you cooperate and anywhere
else you have access to a broadband connection.  Because of the way that wireless mesh technology works, you can add wefrii points and have them mesh wirelessly with each other allowing multiple points within an area to connect via one broadband connection.  Such a network can grow endlessly offering free wi-fi along with high
quality hyper-local advertising.
You can further customize the splash
page so that depending on where the user is, different ads will show up or they
will show up in a different order.  If
you connect to the wefrii point near “Johnny’s Grocery Store” the first thing
you’ll see are today’s specials at Johnny’s. 
If you’re across the street at “Sam’s Meat Market,” you’ll see what’s on
sale at Sam’s first, and farther down you’ll see Johnny’s specials.  You can even customize what the user sees
based on the time of day or whether it’s a weekday or the weekend.  Customization and flexibility are key
features.



Beyond this, the potential applications
are endless.  Through wefrii points, restaurants
can promote their menus or sell their brand name products used in their
cooking.  Hotels can offer free wi-fi
while informing their customers of sightseeing services, room service, car
rental and tourist activities offered by the hotel and its partners.  Airports, hospitals and sports complexes will
benefit greatly by informing users of where they can go for refreshments, food,
emergency services and yes, even where to go when nature calls.  Malls and shopping centres will be able to
advertise all of their shops and services based on your location.  Municipal wi-fi can truly be free, viable and
sustainable by creating a business framework that is mutually beneficial for
local businesses, the citizens of cities and the municipalities
themselves.  


This is a simple example of a splash page that you will be able to create with our dashboard.  If the content is all Greek to you, don't worry, it really is in Greek!




 With the addition of our mobi-wefrii option, that
is, mobile wefrii points, public transit buses, trains and tour buses can provide free wi-fi
access to travellers while informing all those connected of restaurants, stores and
services that exist at the next few stops.  In addition, one of our future stretch goals may be the development of a sati-wefrii point, an option that will allow wefrii points to connect via satellite.  These can be installed on ferry boats, airplanes as well as cruise ships to offer free wi-fi
while informing all users on board of food menus, duty free products,
entertainment programmes or specials on future tickets.
Wefrii VPN Example
Using the above scenario, at your central location, you are running a network service that is vital to your company, such as an inventory database.  When you sell an item at one of your other locations, you want that database to be updated in real time.  Wefrii VPN service allows you to do that.  Just by having one wefrii point at each of your locations and regardless of how these wefrii points connect to the Internet (either via their own broadband connection or via a wireless mesh) you have an almost zero configuration secure VPN service between your locations.  Essentially, as shown in the following diagram, you'll have a network that will allow you to run client server or peer to peer applications between your locations securely and reliably without any additional software whether you are using a wired or wireless connection to a wefrii point.


Note that the wefrii points don't have to be connected to each other directly.  You can have one wefrii point connected to your broadband connection and another one anywhere else in the world connected to another broadband connection and still create a successful VPN, and you can activate the VPN service from the wefrii cloud controller for whichever wefrii points you want.

Wefrii Telephony Example
IP telephony and VoIP technologies are quickly moving from the cutting edge to the mainstream as more and more providers and businesses are adopting the technology.  Wefrii, however, comes to add a new dimention to voice services.  With wefrii, you'll be able to enjoy a service we call Voice over wefrii (VoW).  With this service, wefrii allows you to install one or more IP telephones anywhere there is a wefrii point: at your store locations and, with a mobi wefrii point, even on a tour bus! 



You'll be able to have free inter-location calling through the wefrii network, and, if you connect the network to a PSTN connection at one of your locations, you'll be able to enjoy external calling as well.  Additionally, you'll be able to connect any SIP client app to integrate your smartphone into the wefrii telephony services as well. 
Wefrii Sensor Grid Example
Imagine we deploy a number of sensors within a city that measure temperature, air pressure, humidity, noise pollution and air pollution.  These devices are installed and registered within the wefrii cloud controller by placing them on a map, just like you would with a wefrii point.


Each wefrii sensor sends its data to the controller in the cloud via the wefrii network infrastructure.  The data is then visualised in many different ways.
These devices can send their measurements every certain time interval, say 30 seconds via the wefrii infrastructure to the wefrii cloud controller.  The controller then acts as a sensor information database.  These data are stored and can be presented and visualised in different ways, such as on a point by point basis or as a heat map overlaid upon the map of wefrii sensor nodes.  Historical trends in specific areas of the sensor network can also be viewed and analysed.


Sensor data can be visualised in real time or historically with heat maps, line graphs, table format or specific values from specific points as show in the above image.
These data can then be stored in an open format to be used as open data or as a closed and private data set that's securely protected.
For applications within buildings such as hotels, airports or hospitals for example, there is also the option of including remote control functions for lights, windows, heating, cooling and other systems.  This is essential in improving energy efficiency of buildings.
