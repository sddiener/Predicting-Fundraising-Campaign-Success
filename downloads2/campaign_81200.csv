<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Short Bio:</p>
<p>Alyssa is a Military spouse and singer/songwriter born in Mason City, Iowa. She moved at the age of five to Denver, Colorado. As a child, she moved around the US and Canada with singing as a major part of her life. Over time she became a seasoned, versatile, powerhouse vocalist. She is passionate about music and recently made the move to California. She performed the National Anthem for opening ceremonies at the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club. She is working on original music for her upcoming LP that she is recording with Scott Wilson of Saving Abel, at Sunshine Recording Studios. </p>
<p>She performed in several bands throughout Iowa, Colorado, Virginia and North Dakota. She performed at the Highland Street Festival in Denver; she performed the National Anthem for opening ceremonies at the Rocky Mountain Summer Music Festival in Colorado Springs and later performed at the festival with her band. She appeared as a guest radio host for Tri-lakes Radio in Southern Colorado and performed and collaborated with numerous artists/bands. She performed on KCOS Digital Media simulcast radio show ""The Beat Goes On"", appeared as a guest and performed on a Live Stream Facebook show, ""Morty On the Move”. In addition, she has worked with several bands and venues as a booking agent and was a music advocate in Colorado. </p>
<p>As a young child Alyssa performed for Maria Holly, the late Buddy Holly's wife in Clear Lake, Iowa. She competed in Bill Riley'a Talent Roundup at the North Iowa Fair in Mason City, Iowa. She performed on the Tom Slick Show in Denver and the Taste of Colorado. Internationally Alyssa performed at The Highway, Purples and Little Memphis in Windsor, Ontario Canada. Additionally she competed in the International Freedom Festival and the Essex Singing and Fiddle Competition. As a young teen she lived in Nashville and performed on the original Music Row on a regular basis, alongside her mother. </p>
<p>Furthermore, in 2007 she won a Wild Card round at the Rocking Horse in Minot, North Dakota and opened for Country Music ACM Award winners Sawyer Brown. In 2018 she opened for AMA Award winning Rock band, Firehouse, at The Venue located in Denver. In 2019 Alyssa guest performed with Scott Wilson of Saving Abel at Herman's Hideaway during his show with Michael Alexander (Michael Alexander and the Big Whiskey). She opened for Billboard Award &amp; 2x ASCAP Award winner J.R. Richards of Dishwalla, legendary hip hop artist Coolio with the band Pretty Vague and opened for Billboard chart topping rock band Hinder, at Sunshine Studios Live in Colorado Springs. </p>
<h3>Why is this Important to me?</h3>
<ul><li>When I was a little girl, my mom competed in the Nashville Recording Workshop singing competition and made it to the finals in Nashville, Tennessee. She performed at the Grand Ole Opry. She performed on that stage. That is a dream for many vocalists, artists and bands out there. When she came home and we watched her video tape, I was already inspired by her, however, this was a different sensation. There was a little girl named Ashley who sang on that show, which ignited my flame. Since then, I have a burning desire to do this. It is more than just a dream, it is my passion. It is my love. I used to write ""Thank You"" speeches for the Grammy's and practice in the mirror. I would practice harmony parts to my favorite bands for when I got to share the stage with them. I used to cry myself to sleep because I wanted it so bad. As an adult, I realized that if I want it, I have to go out there and get it. This is important to me because I would be able to better provide for my family. I would be able to be more involved with doing things for our troops, my favorite charity organizations and help raise awareness to things I am passionate about. I would be able to fulfill my hearts desire and inspire others to go after their dreams and show them that no matter what kind of a background you come from, you can achieve anything by hard work and determination. </li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""> </p>
<ul><li>Thank you very kindly for believing in me, for your contributions and for your continued support on my music journey. You are all part of my motivation. This is for me, but this is also for you. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>My goal is $25,000. This will fund my startup to complete recording of my full length album, a music video, photo shoot, music distribution and merchandise. If by chance there is anything leftover, it will go towards a tour startup, so that I may join you for a night of music in a nearby city. </li>
<li>The perk packages are Military themed. They include an assortment of official Alyssa Ruffin merchandise and music. I also dedicated a special package to my Father, who was a Marine Corps Veteran, fisherman, Minnesota Vikings fan and Chef. He passed away in September 2018 from Prostate Cancer. I am very excited about his perk package!</li>
<li>If the goal isn't reached, all funds will still go towards everything previously mentioned and I will continue to raise funds however I can, until I reach my overall goal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scott Wilson is a music industry professional. He is the bass player for BMI Award Winning Rock Band Saving Abel and the former bass player of Grammy nominated Rock Band Tantric. When Scott isn't out there living the dream, he is working at Sunshine Studios Live alongside Christina ""Sunshine"" Corbitt. Attached to Sunshine Studios Live is Sunshine Recording Studio, where Scott and his partner Richard Easterling spend their time producing artists. Scott Wilson has an average of 7 artists signed to major record labels, every single year. </li>
<li>Scott and Christina believe in Alyssa. They have given her well earned opportunities to perform on their stage at Sunshine Studios Live to open for major artists there such as; J.R. of Dishwalla, Coolio and Hinder. </li>
</ul>
<h3>​Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>The challenges I face are simple. I am a Military spouse. I am a mother. I will spend several days, weeks and even months away from my family to record in Colorado in order to finish my record and to go on tour.</li>
<li>Being a Military spouse for the past 10 years, as a family we are already trained for separation. We know how to make it work. We have a plan in place for when this takes off.</li>
<li>Thanks to technology, we will be able to video chat. I will also make trips home during tours, when it allows. They can also make trips out to shows. Everyone is excited!</li>
</ul>
<h3>​Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Want to help financially but can't afford a package listed or just want to send a different dollar amount? I also have venmo, paypal and accept funds through Facebook messenger. </li>
<li>Prefer sending cash or check? Email alyssaruffin@gmail.com or charles.d.ruffin@gmail.com for details.</li>
<li>Tell your family, friends and bosses about me, about my fundraiser and share it with everyone you know and often!! Share it to groups. Be sure to include a message in all of your posts. Let them know I am your friend, niece, cousin, fellow musician, whatever roll I play in your life, simply just tell them. </li>

<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>My name is Muck Sticky, and I am an independent recording artist and filmmaker. After the success of our recent film 'Dig That, Zeebo Newton', I've decided it's time to get back in the studio and record my 15th album (20th catalog title).</p>
<h3>About:</h3>
<p>Most of you know, I've never had the luxury of relying on big record labels or corporate sponsors to fund my creative projects. I rely on fans like YOU by offering limited edition items for pre-sale to help fund my creative projects. After the success of the 'Wacky' album campaign, along with the massive support on the 'Zeebo Newton' movie campaign, I need your help to finish my new album 'HIGHER LEVEL'.</p>
<p>This album marks my twentieth year of making music, so this is a HUGE deal for me. Sometimes I struggle with the pressures of handling everything that comes along with being an independent artist, but when I see the love and support so many of you show it inspires me to keep going.</p>
<p>This album also marks the first time I will be pressing VINYL copies. We will be offering a LIMITED EDITION vinyl 'Higher Level' album, as well as a currently untitled ""greatest hits"" vinyl album.</p>
<p>I will personally make sure each and every one of you receive what you pay for, and there are some cool extra perks like ""video chat listening party"" where we hang out online while I play the new album for you before it is released to the public. So please check out the perks, and choose the best one that fits you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My studio computer of twelve years recently crashed, so it's been an expensive process rebuilding to get back to recording. But I am glad to say, that with the help of some great friends, I am back to business. And the music is sounding better than ever. But I need a budget to finish it.</p>
<p>I still need the funds to cover the CD &amp; vinyl pressings, as well as the recording/mixing/mastering time and process. Plus, we plan to shoot several new music videos for the new album. Before the computer crashed, we filmed and released the two new music videos ""Like This"" and ""Ballin' On Them Haters"". But I also had a few songs and videos I lost. So I have some recovery work to do on those.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My music is all about having fun and enjoying life, and making the best of the tough world we live in. It makes me feel good to make other people feel good, and I think the world needs more people who are pleasant, kind, and share good vibes.</p>
<p>My last album was released in 2016, and it's taken me a while to create a few movie projects since then. So my music has been on hold. With your help on this campaign, it will give me the jump start I need to get back to making music full time again.</p>
<p>If you remember the 'Zeebo' or 'Wacky' campaigns, you know we had a major success with both of them. I'm excited about the music on this new album, and I can't wait to share it with all of you. So please join me on this journey to make a new album and contribute at whatever level you can.</p>
<p>I promise to deliver the BEST album I've EVER MADE!!! And we will do it together!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course there are risks and challenges with any project, but considering this is my fifteenth album I think it is safe to say I can complete it with your help.</p>
<p>We've had several great IndieGoGo projects in the past, and those turned out great.</p>
<p>Making an album is much easier than making a full-length feature film about my life story, and we did that. With MAJOR SUCCESS. Just google 'Dig That, Zeebo Newton'.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Hi, Ich bin Christoph, Meister für Veranstaltungstechnik und technischer Leiter in einem Kulturzentrum, Tontechniker, Musikproduzent, Dozent für Veranstaltungstechnik und Musikproduktion, Songwriter, Bassit, Gitarrist, Sänger, Papa. Ihr seht, ich halte mich viel in der Nähe von ""richtigen"" Künstlern auf, doch wie bin ich dort hingekommen?</p>
<p>Ich lebe Musik schon seit ich denken kann, komme aus einer musikbegeisterten Familie und bin schon als Kind auf vielen Bühnen gewesen. Ich spiele in Bands seit ich 16 Jahre alt bin. Musik hat mir viele Türen geöffnet und Begegnungen rund um den Globus ermöglicht. Heute stehe ich hier und möchte - zum ersten Mal - ein Soloprojekt vorstellen. Wie ihr am Namen meines Musikprojekts sehen könnt war ich fast immer der Sidekick, jemand, der den 'eigentlichen' Künstler unterstützt. Bei diesem Projekt, welches ich Euch vorstellen möchte, habe ich alles selbst gemacht, Songs geschrieben, arrangiert, Instrumente eingespielt, gesungen, produziert. (Naja okay, also ein wenig Unterstützung von talentierten Freunden und Kolleg*innen hatte ich schon... :)</p>
<p>Auf das Ergebnis, mein Debut Soloalbum, bin ich sehr stolz und möchte es Euch daher hier auf Indiegogo präsentieren. 10 wundervolle Songs, rockig, mit Texten die eine wichtige Aussage haben. Musik kann Menschen zusammenführen und ehrlich sein. Sie kann helfen, die Risse die durch unsere Gesellschaft gehen kleiner zu machen. Sie kann inspirieren und uns durch schwere Zeiten führen.</p>
<p>Die Präsentation über Crowdfunding habe ich ganz bewusst ausgesucht, denn sie passt zur Entstehung des Albums und nutzt die Vorteile des technischen Fortschritts. Es gibt nur mich als Songwriter und dich als Hörer, ohne fette Plattenfirma, Verlage oder Vertrieb.</p>
<p>Ich würde mich sehr freuen wenn du die Kampagne unterstützt. Ich möchte 1.600 € für die Produktion von CDs und richtigem Rockbandmerch einsammeln. Bei dieser Summe liegt der Break für eine sinnvolle Produktion. Das Finanzierungsziel ist allerdings flexibel, so dass du dein Shirt, die CD oder den Download Code auch bekommst, wenn wir das Ziel nicht erreichen. Du kannst auch andere Dinge bestellen, oder ich komme mit der Band vorbei und spiele auf deiner Geburtstagsparty! Also schau dich ruhig um, es gibt viele coole Perks zu entdecken.</p>
<p>A Propos Band, es gibt tatsächlich ein paar verrückte Jungs, die die Songs mit mir live performen. Wir werden in diesem Jahr loslegen und die Bühnen der Republik erobern, vielleicht auch in deiner Stadt.</p>
<p>Vielen Dank für deinen Support!</p>
<p>SIDEK!CK</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, I am Christoph, Master in Event Technology, TD, Sound Engineer, Producer, Professor, Songwriter, Bass and Guitar Player, Singer, Songwriter, Father of Two based in Hannover, Germany. Ever since I was a Boy I performed Music on Stage, and I started playing in Rock Bands at the Age of 16. Music helped me discover the World and took me around the Globe in different Lineups and different Positions. But, as you can see by the Name of this Project, I was mostly just the Sidekick. With this Album, I am taking the Step into Leading the Band. I always had a huge Love for Music and writing Songs. My Dream was to one day record a Solo Album all by myself. I am very grateful to say this Dream has been fulfilled this Year. The Album is ready, Ten beautiful Songs well written, arranged, recorded and Mastered.</p>
<p>Now I am not a big Star with a huge Record Company backing me. I wrote and recorded all these Songs on my own, and to finish this Project, I want to publish them in the same way, with no Man in the Middle. One of the great Advantages the digital World has to offer is to have this Direct Connection. It's just me, the Musician, and you, the Listener.</p>
<p>Music has the Power to unite People and help us through troubled Times.

Hi, Ich bin Christoph, Meister für Veranstaltungstechnik und technischer Leiter in einem Kulturzentrum, Tontechniker, Musikproduzent, Dozent für Veranstaltungstechnik und Musikproduktion, Songwriter, Bassit, Gitarrist, Sänger, Papa. Ihr seht, ich halte mich viel in der Nähe von ""richtigen"" Künstlern auf, doch wie bin ich dort hingekommen?
Ich lebe Musik schon seit ich denken kann, komme aus einer musikbegeisterten Familie und bin schon als Kind auf vielen Bühnen gewesen. Ich spiele in Bands seit ich 16 Jahre alt bin. Musik hat mir viele Türen geöffnet und Begegnungen rund um den Globus ermöglicht. Heute stehe ich hier und möchte - zum ersten Mal - ein Soloprojekt vorstellen. Wie ihr am Namen meines Musikprojekts sehen könnt war ich fast immer der Sidekick, jemand, der den 'eigentlichen' Künstler unterstützt. Bei diesem Projekt, welches ich Euch vorstellen möchte, habe ich alles selbst gemacht, Songs geschrieben, arrangiert, Instrumente eingespielt, gesungen, produziert. (Naja okay, also ein wenig Unterstützung von talentierten Freunden und Kolleg*innen hatte ich schon... :)
Auf das Ergebnis, mein Debut Soloalbum, bin ich sehr stolz und möchte es Euch daher hier auf Indiegogo präsentieren. 10 wundervolle Songs, rockig, mit Texten die eine wichtige Aussage haben. Musik kann Menschen zusammenführen und ehrlich sein. Sie kann helfen, die Risse die durch unsere Gesellschaft gehen kleiner zu machen. Sie kann inspirieren und uns durch schwere Zeiten führen.
Die Präsentation über Crowdfunding habe ich ganz bewusst ausgesucht, denn sie passt zur Entstehung des Albums und nutzt die Vorteile des technischen Fortschritts. Es gibt nur mich als Songwriter und dich als Hörer, ohne fette Plattenfirma, Verlage oder Vertrieb.
Ich würde mich sehr freuen wenn du die Kampagne unterstützt. Ich möchte 1.600 € für die Produktion von CDs und richtigem Rockbandmerch einsammeln. Bei dieser Summe liegt der Break für eine sinnvolle Produktion. Das Finanzierungsziel ist allerdings flexibel, so dass du dein Shirt, die CD oder den Download Code auch bekommst, wenn wir das Ziel nicht erreichen. Du kannst auch andere Dinge bestellen, oder ich komme mit der Band vorbei und spiele auf deiner Geburtstagsparty! Also schau dich ruhig um, es gibt viele coole Perks zu entdecken.
A Propos Band, es gibt tatsächlich ein paar verrückte Jungs, die die Songs mit mir live performen. Wir werden in diesem Jahr loslegen und die Bühnen der Republik erobern, vielleicht auch in deiner Stadt.
Vielen Dank für deinen Support!
SIDEK!CK
 
 
Hi, I am Christoph, Master in Event Technology, TD, Sound Engineer, Producer, Professor, Songwriter, Bass and Guitar Player, Singer, Songwriter, Father of Two based in Hannover, Germany. Ever since I was a Boy I performed Music on Stage, and I started playing in Rock Bands at the Age of 16. Music helped me discover the World and took me around the Globe in different Lineups and different Positions. But, as you can see by the Name of this Project, I was mostly just the Sidekick. With this Album, I am taking the Step into Leading the Band. I always had a huge Love for Music and writing Songs. My Dream was to one day record a Solo Album all by myself. I am very grateful to say this Dream has been fulfilled this Year. The Album is ready, Ten beautiful Songs well written, arranged, recorded and Mastered.
Now I am not a big Star with a huge Record Company backing me. I wrote and recorded all these Songs on my own, and to finish this Project, I want to publish them in the same way, with no Man in the Middle. One of the great Advantages the digital World has to offer is to have this Direct Connection. It's just me, the Musician, and you, the Listener.
Music has the Power to unite People and help us through troubled Times. Music always helped me, and with these Songs I would like to give something back, to try to heal the Cracks running through our Society but also to speak out against Hate and Egoism. By Supporting this Campaign, You will not only be rewarded with the Full Album, Shirts, Hoodies or Gym Bag. You also help getting SIDEK!CK out there on the Road.

<h3>It's Done!!</h3>
<p><strong>After four+ years of work and collaboration, my children's CD is done being recorded and mixed!</strong> As I write this, 21 songs are entering the final mastering process and will be headed for the press in early December. Included are many new, original songs as well as a few re-worked favorites, such as You are my Sunshine and Good Night Irene (with updated lyrics...). I have had the pleasure of collaborating on these songs with Shimshai, Aimee Ringle, Samara Jade, Cornflower and others~ as well as getting some local children into the studio, including my own three young ones. It's been a lot of fun... and a lot of work! :)</p>
<p><i><strong>These songs are for the children... and for all of us.</strong></i></p>
<p>The intention of this CD has been to provide children with high-quality, beautiful, conscious music~ And my hope is that it will be enjoyable by all ages. These songs are designed to be calming and inspirational, so that adults who listen along with youth will also enjoy them! :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Order for the holidays, for yourself, or loved ones!</h3>
<p><strong>To support the final mastering of the tracks &amp; the printing of physical CDs, please pre-order your copy or make a donation here!</strong> To pre-order, please check out the ""perks"" listed and select the level/number of CDs you'd like to order.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How will the funds be used?</h3>
<p>I've done all the recording and a majority of the sound engineering work on this project myself, which has brought some of my costs down, but  it’s still taken a lot of investment to get the project this far. Printing CDs will cost about $1500, and the final production costs  will be $700-$1200. If I raise more than my goal, it will go to reimburse my music production fund, so I can get started sooner on the next CD of my music... (I've got about 20 more original songs on the back burner, waiting for their turn to be recorded!).</p>

<h3>It All Started With A Couple Chords</h3>
<p>It's amazing how when somebody invests into you, what can come out of it. It really began when my father invested his time when I was younger to start teaching me chords on my grandfather's Martin guitar. I still remember the cracks in the wood and how that guitar was the best thing I had ever heard. I also spent a lot of time with my grandmother growing up and she taught me the joy of music. She would always be singing, either acapella or while playing the piano. This started me on a musical journey that has meant so much to me over the years.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576178028/rpks2wkrvzujidbr4ovi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When I started writing my own songs, this opened up a whole new world to me. This was a brand new avenue of artistic expression that I fell in love with. It became a way for me to capture what I was feeling in the moment and put it into a piece of music. I loved singing random words while recording on an old laptop and listening back to hear if anything good was in there. Till this day I still do that exact same thing.</p>
<p>Through my years of making music I've always wanted to create a full length record of songs that I really believed in and needed to share. These songs have finally come together in a record that will be called 'The Redlander'. With my Indiegogo campaign, it gives you the opportunity to take part of this musical experience too! I believe this is a way for the music to gain more value and also become a greater part of your life. </p>

<h3>What To Do And What You Get!</h3>
<p>You will be able to contribute by choosing from the many different perks I have made available on this campaign. I have options that include digital downloads, an autographed copy of The Redlander, a T-shirt that will only be for campaign backers, recorded cover songs, handwritten lyric sheets, having a song written from your idea, having your name in the album credits, a chance to win one of my guitars, house concerts, having your business as a sponsor and more!</p>

<p>By becoming a backer it will also help cover the expenses it takes to bring music into the world. Without having a label behind me for funding, that part is left up to me to take care of and it can be tough to do. The goal for this campaign is $5,000 and all contributions will go towards some of the main recording costs like producing, mixing, mastering, and distribution; on top of Indiegogo fees. Anything over that will help in other areas like studio players and promotion costs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support in this is what makes this project so much more special to me. In the past I did a campaign similar to this for my first EP and it made all the difference by partnering with others to bring it to life. I made that EP back in 2012 and I still have people that tell me how much those songs mean to them. Music truly is powerful and I love that it can touch a person's heart. I can have a hand in that, and you can as well. Moving forward with these new songs means bringing new art into the world and creating something that will last for years to come. I'm excited we get to do this together and can't wait for you to hear The Redlander!</p>

The goal for this campaign is $5,000 and all contributions will go towards some of the main recording costs like producing, mixing, mastering, and distribution; on top of Indiegogo fees. Anything over that will help in other areas like studio players and promotion costs.

The Impact
Your support in this is what makes this project so much more special to me. In the past I did a campaign similar to this for my first EP and it made all the difference by partnering with others to bring it to life. I made that EP back in 2012 and I still have people that tell me how much those songs mean to them. Music truly is powerful and I love that it can touch a person's heart. I can have a hand in that, and you can as well. Moving forward with these new songs means bringing new art into the world and creating something that will last for years to come. I'm excited we get to do this together and can't wait for you to hear The Redlander!

Thank you for your support!!
Zach

<p>Hela <i>Skillingnytt </i>andas en inspirerande nyfikenhet på människan och på den tid som har varit. En vädjan om att vi ska lära av vår historia. </p>
<p>Sångerna tar upp allt från festliga anekdoter till tragik och maktförtryck. Berättelserna kommer från Kiruna i norr och Sörmjöle i söder.

Om tvångsförflyttningen av samer. Om svåra förlossningar för 100 år sedan. Om tantkalas på 30-talet.</p>

<h3>what's going on! </h3>
<p>We have all been through a year together that has dramatically changed us all. I am thankful to have maintained my health but, as many musicians and artists have experienced, I lost nearly an entire year of my typical performance income. Music venues and musicians alike have struggled to stay afloat and come up with creative ways of connecting to their fans and audiences. It has been challenging to grow in this time but, for myself, I have found many new musical inspirations and confidants. The past 13+ months have allowed me to explore my musical tastes and connect with fellow musicians I've always wanted to create with. </p>
<p>I am amidst working on a brand new Remember Jones album. I have written or co-written every song on this album, working alongside many musicians and collaborators in and out of studios. Though I've released two albums before, this would be my first, completely original, STUDIO album release. i am EXCITED! nervous! scared! HYPED! ALL THAT! </p>
<p>I have vigorously toured my past original music and original contributions, as well as my theatrical presentations of the music of Amy Winehouse, Queen, Joe Cocker, Kanye West, Jeff Buckley and more. These experiences have introduced so many people to my music and my style of entertainment; this new album hopes to broaden that base and to bring me to places I have yet to see. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>what i need / what you get!</h3>
<p>I am looking for your help in funding this album for me. Having lost all of my touring income in 2020 and most of 2021, creating this for you has proven nearly impossible. I am looking to raise $35,000 through your contributions. Truthfully, this is only a fraction of the overall cost but this will help make ALL of the musicians, producers, engineers, studios, and designers feel secure in their work. This is a challenging time to ask for favors, I know it. So many of you have already done so much for me this past year and beyond. It's also hard for me to ask favors of fellow creators; they deserve to be taken care of just as much as you take care of me. </p>
<p>Alongside this new album will be new branding for Remember Jones: digital marketing, website, graphic designs, album design, clothing designs for shows, production for shows, light/sound enhancements, new stage performances, live musicians, and other crazy shit I've conjured up with all of the free time in the past year! I have been VERY inspired and your help will bring me to the heightened level I need to be at! </p>
<p>With your donation to this album there will be several exciting perks, my favorite of all being a special, intimate, listening party of the album IN MY HOME before anyone else can hear it. You'll be introduced to several people who helped bring the album to life and hear stories of every song in a special performance space that's being created inside my home! Other perks include private performances, new merchandise, listing in the liner notes, and pre-ordering your copy of the CD, vinyl, and more! </p>
<p>*DONATE IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS and I will PERSONALLY SIGN all CDs and VINYLs! AVAILABLE FOR FREE FOR FIRST 24 HOURS ONLY!*</p>
</div><div>
<h3>why this makes a difference</h3>
<p>As a music lover, you may already know that the industry is very tough on independent artists. Most listeners resort to streaming their music which does not fairly pay artists. Touring, which has been non-existent for the past year +, is the best way to connect with fans and new audiences and the best way to sell merchandise. One of my greatest pleasures is personally signing a vinyl that someone has bought at the end of a show. They may never know the work that went into creating that piece of art but they are trusting ME and my musical confidants with purchasing this addition to the home music library. It makes me feel so lucky in those moments!</p>
<p>This would be my second IndieGogo campaign. In 2016, I put myself out there to raise money for the debut Remember Jones album. Asking for $12, I raised nearly $20k -- and this was before any songs were written or recorded, and before I experienced touring nationally. This was the basis of getting Remember Jones on it's feet. I am back to that feeling - of starting new, re-branding, re-creating, evolving, and ready to share with my fans, my family!, the re-birth!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>your help beyond donations! </h3>
<p>Full transparency: social media algorithms make it harder and harder to connect with you personally. We are always trying to find ways to stay in touch and it is a DAUNTING task. Not only are we making music but we are doing all of this work to get you to hear it. Maybe you can't donate as much as you'd like or maybe you can! Either way, your help sharing this with friends or personally contacting other fans and family members is worth just as much as the financial give. Maybe you know someone that has the ability to help an independent artist but may not have heard of Remember Jones? Your help connecting with them will go a very long in helping us reach our goal! </p>
<p>Make some noise about the campaign! I ain't too proud to beg in these times -- this year has been IMPOSSIBLE for musicians. This album is more ME than ever before - please use any of the tools provided by IndieGogo and share to whoever you can! We have ONE month to reach this goal or exceed it - and I believe it's VERY possible! &lt;3</p>

Alongside making the tracks and a physical copy available, I hope to have a video ready for the release so we can all sit down and enjoy the music and images together when it comes out -- just the way I've been hearing things in my head for years!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I debued these songs at Full Circle Festival in 2017, Mike Kerr called it one of the best sets of the festival. They're not particularly sad songs - nobody gets too too hurt - but a lot of people said they'd cried during the set. If anything can elicit that kind of emotion nowadays, it must be worth something. Maybe we could go somewhere with that kind of energy. A group cry could do us some real good.</p>
<p>My previous project, Crocus Song made its way to the Bedouin of the Jordanian desert and the Sami reindeer-herders of Scandanavia, who sent their words of appreciation. </p>
<p>With this album I want us to think about what it means to know one another by knowing our desires. It begins with ""Canada"", where the desire to run from one's worst fears and lonliness result in getting a lot of work done, and ends on ""Mariner"", based on real events, where the narrator wonders how he can go on after having to abandon the boat he built himself. How do our desires propel us, and how do we account for the sacrifices we all make? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Once we get the ball rolling there's no stopping it. The music industry is in shambles, and there's nowhere to really sell CDs. The risk is the same as ever -- art can be seen as useless.</p>
<p>If we don't hit the funding mark we'll release this in stages and cobble them together eventually, but in terms of this project, ""eventually"" is long gone. Should the goal not be reached, the project will be more self-funded. The video aspect will be reduced.</p>

</span></h3>
<p>Hello WORLD, my name is Timorris Lane, your Global Ambassador of Love. I'm a singer originally from Cleveland, OH, and currently live in the big apple, NYC. I've spent the last 6 months recording my debut album, an EP made up of 5 exclusive songs, and here I am, ready to shoot my first major music video.</p>
<p>My musical journey began, in my youth, singing in church with my entire family. This organic experience soon  blessed me with the opportunity to perform with the Cleveland Boy's Choir for over the span of a decade.  After school I moved to Atlanta, GA to pursue my first major moves with singing professionally.

Hello WORLD, my name is Timorris Lane, your Global Ambassador of Love. I'm a singer originally from Cleveland, OH, and currently live in the big apple, NYC. I've spent the last 6 months recording my debut album, an EP made up of 5 exclusive songs, and here I am, ready to shoot my first major music video.
My musical journey began, in my youth, singing in church with my entire family. This organic experience soon  blessed me with the opportunity to perform with the Cleveland Boy's Choir for over the span of a decade.  After school I moved to Atlanta, GA to pursue my first major moves with singing professionally. I started working with Nicci Gilbert from Brownstone, engaged some of my favorite producers, like B. Cox, and really began figuring out where my pace was within the industry.
My next focus was to relocate to Los Angeles, where I started showcasing my original music.  I was given opportunities to sing background for BeBe Winans, Glladys Knight, Rod Stewart, and there met and sang for one of my biggest musical influences, David Foster (that was CRAZY!!).  I left LA wanting to be closer to my family and to plugin to what NYC has to offer...and the rest is history!
 I am extremely proud of the EP I am preparing to release. I  know you're going to love it and sync with my musics universal vibe.  I believe that it offers a variety of style, while still remaining at its core, honest and true to who I am and represent.  
First and foremost, this campaign is to raise money for my premiere music video, simultaneously, connecting my fan base and supporters to my platform as a Global Ambassador of Love through my music.  This venture is super important because it propels not only the visual of the song's message, but the EP in its entirety.  As my breakout to the world, it has to be the best it can be as it sets the tone for my entire music career.     What We Need & What You Get Filming my breakout music video is going to take funding for the following:
 Location
Videographer
Equipment
Production
Crew
Promotion

The bulk of the funding is going to securing an amazing director, location and all required equipment to execute my project from conception to completion. This includes a crew of devoted friends and supporters, as well as, additionally hiring a choreographer, stylist, and proper promotion.

<h3>About the Santa Fe Youth Symphony Association<br/>
</h3> <ul> <li>The Santa Fe Youth Symphony Association (SFYSA), now in its 21st season, provides music instruction and performance opportunities to nearly 200 Santa Fe youth in orchestra, mariachi, and jazz.</li>
<li>SFYSA strongly believes that ALL students should have the opportunity to participate in music education, regardless of their ability to buy or rent a string instrument.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why We Need Your Help<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<ul>
<li>Instruments and strings <i>don't </i>grow on trees, and...<br/>
</li>
<li>SFYSA spends over $6,000 annually on instrument repairs and instrument rentals so that our string students can have easy access to an instrument.</li>
<li>Instruments are provided completely free of charge by SFYSA to students and we need your help to continue making this offer.</li>
<li>SFYSA currently has nearly 200 instruments in its inventory, however, we are unable to use all of them because of lack of funds to make all necessary repairs.<br/>
</li>
<li>Because of the constant variation of students and instrument sizes, it is almost always necessary to rent instruments from outside providers. Thus, even if <i>all</i> SFYSA owned instruments were repaired, we would still require funds for instrument rentals. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Example of Expenses</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Average monthly cost to rent ONE instrument: $30</li>
<li>Average yearly cost for ONE student to use a rented instrument: $270 (average 12 per year)<br/>
</li>
<li>Single instrument replacement: $350-700 (average of 2 per year)<br/>
</li>
<li>Bow replacement: $50-80 (average of 10 bows per year)<br/>
</li>
<li>Bridge replacement: $70-$100 (average of 3 per year)</li>
<li>Instrument repair (body work): $100-300 (average of 2 per year)<br/>

About the Santa Fe Youth Symphony Association
  The Santa Fe Youth Symphony Association (SFYSA), now in its 21st season, provides music instruction and performance opportunities to nearly 200 Santa Fe youth in orchestra, mariachi, and jazz.
SFYSA strongly believes that ALL students should have the opportunity to participate in music education, regardless of their ability to buy or rent a string instrument.
   Why We Need Your Help
 

Instruments and strings don't grow on trees, and...

SFYSA spends over $6,000 annually on instrument repairs and instrument rentals so that our string students can have easy access to an instrument.
Instruments are provided completely free of charge by SFYSA to students and we need your help to continue making this offer.
SFYSA currently has nearly 200 instruments in its inventory, however, we are unable to use all of them because of lack of funds to make all necessary repairs.

Because of the constant variation of students and instrument sizes, it is almost always necessary to rent instruments from outside providers. Thus, even if all SFYSA owned instruments were repaired, we would still require funds for instrument rentals. 


Example of Expenses


Average monthly cost to rent ONE instrument: $30
Average yearly cost for ONE student to use a rented instrument: $270 (average 12 per year)

Single instrument replacement: $350-700 (average of 2 per year)

Bow replacement: $50-80 (average of 10 bows per year)

Bridge replacement: $70-$100 (average of 3 per year)
Instrument repair (body work): $100-300 (average of 2 per year)


Perks! What You Get



We have put together a list of ""perks"", which are items and/or services that our organization can offer you with minimal expenses. Perks include everything from a year's worth of tickets to SFYSA concerts, to the opportunity to sing with our Mariachi groups, as well as your own private concert!
You are also invited to donate ""just because"", you are not required to accept perk offers.

For the fans of Sad Robot, you know much like Rome- we weren't built in a day.  We started by laying bricks. 
This band has been our passion and has encompassed our life for about 4 years. All those years of late night writing, and refining have led us to this point. 

BRIEF HISTORY
Our hard work has resulted in 2 full length albums and multiple single releases, , management, several tv placements(FOX, ESPN), tours, SXSW, performing at the Staples Center, First place at LAMN Jam competition(previously won by Aloe Blacc, The Mowglis), #1 ON KROQ Locals only for 5 straight weeks, and more. 

   
       



We've been able to do this all without the help of a label or any other support, just a love for creating music and occasionally cupcake fundraisers. 

 WHERE WE ARE NOW

Some signifigant life changes occurred to us in 2014 which led us to write the most honest, challenging, and best group of songs we've ever been able to produce. This is not just an album though, but our first ever story, combining our love of indie rock, orchestral music, dance, and film into one artistic statement.  

ROYAL BLOOD

We began to visualize the story of ROYAL BLOOD while simulataneously writing the melodies and beats. With the music and lyrics completed, we combined the two into a tragic, beautiful story of love and loss. An album inspired by our real lives with a short film .  This is a musical leap forward for us and the most inspired we've ever been in our lives.




The Challenge

Writing / recording the album and filming a beautiful short film is difficult enough, however- the real struggle is what happens after all that.  You need a fan base to engage, a budget for marketing your album, a PR team to make people aware of who you are, artwork, physical copies of your album, and TOURING.  All of this we need your help with so we can no longer say our dreams are impossible because of money or waiting for a label.

<p><span>I'm Joya Wesley, Fred's daughter and manager, asking all my fellow Fred lovers and music lovers for your financial participation in this exciting CD project. </span></p>
<p><span>The album represents a return to his roots and will celebrate the Blues with all that Fred is, all the experience he has acquired, and all the music he has made, heard and felt in the 55 years since he first left his home in Alabama to tour the chitlin' circuit as a 17-year-old sideman with Ike and Tina Turner.</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>About Fred</h3>
<div>
<div>Fred Wesley is the legendary bandleader, trombonist and author revered worldwide as one of the founding fathers of funk, along with former colleagues James Brown, Pee Wee Ellis and George Clinton. He also is leader of the standard-setting band, the New JBs.</div>
<div>His critically-acclaimed memoir <i>Hit Me, Fred: Recollections of a Side Man</i> (Duke University Press, 2002) chronicles through hilarious stories a half-century of music through the eyes of one of the world’s most-sampled, yet most humble, musicians. </div>
<div>Born in Columbus, Ga., and raised in Mobile, Ala., Fred began his career as a teenage trombonist with Ike and Tina Turner. He later was music director, arranger, producer, trombonist and a primary composer for Brown from 1968-1975, when he joined Parliament-Funkadelic and Bootsy’s Rubber Band.</div>
<div>With Brown, Fred became  “the world’s most famous sideman, orchestrating the sinuous grooves and contributing the bold, surgically precise solos that defined the language of funk.” His distinctive sound as a trombonist and distinctive feel as an arranger later played into taking funk to the next level with George Clinton and Bootsy Collins. </div>
<div>Fred has recorded a dozen solo albums including the cult favorite <i>House Party; </i>he is featured in the recent HBO documentary <i>Mr. Dynamite</i>, as well as <i>Soul Power</i>, the Oscar-winning <i>When We Were Kings</i>, and countless other funk documentaries and books. In addition to touring with his band, he makes numerous guest appearances and gives master classes around the world.</div>
<div>Also a veteran of the Count Basie Orchestra, Fred has worked with scores of other artists including Ray Charles, Vanessa Williams, Pancho Sanchez, Dee Lite, Christian McBride and Donald Harrison. He also collaborated with clarinetist David Krakauer and the Canadian artist Socalled to create the klezmer-funk-hip hop project Abraham Inc.</div>
</div>
<h3>About the album</h3>
</div><div> <p></p>
<div></div>
<div>
<p><span>""The first music I ever heard was the blues,"" Fred says in his book, recalling the juke box that played blues all night, just inches from his head, in the Blue Diamond Cafe, a juke joint right next door to his boyhood bedroom. ""The blues is the underpinning of all the music I have ever made.""</span></p>
<p>Although his first love -- jazz -- and the music that made him famous -- funk -- have dominated his life's work, he has harbored a love for old-school, silly-serious blues tunes like the Earl King classic ""Trick Bag,"" which he recorded in the '90s and frequently performs to this day.  He especially loved and was impacted by a Bobby Blue Bland release from his youth, <i>Don't Cry No More, </i>which featured fat horn arrangements by then-bandleader Joe Scott.</p>
<p>Fred's plan now is to take 13 such tunes -- both classics such as ""Big-Legged Emma's House"" and new compositions by Fred and friends in the same vein -- give them different blues rhythm arrangements, then add massive horn arrangements. Handling lead vocals himself in his own, inimitable Southern style, he will cut the tracks with the versatile musicians who have made up his New JBs for 25 years, along with the Chops Horns and other special guests.</p>

<h1>“<i>It's not about the Richter Scale; it's
about the earthquake.”<br/><br/></i>
</h1>
<p>My name is Dashel Millihart and I make Free Range Folk Rock.
That's music for folks to listen to when they want to feel good about
<i>feeling good about </i>being alive. All of the quotes you see here
are lyrics from songs I've come up with.  I am not alone in
calling this time, “The Platinum Era.” What else can we call a
time when the Best Things Ever are everywhere? “Going Platinum”
used to be something record sales did. “Going Viral” is the new
“Going Platinum.” The requirement is the same: touch a million
people.  I say this: ""Funk a million people.""  In fact, Funk the Platinum Era in the first place!  That's what I say.<br/><br/> </p><h3>“<i>'Everything has been said,'
has been said.”<br/><br/></i>
</h3>
<p>It's easy to feel worthless in the Platinum Era. Megalithic Hope
is up against the Best Desperation Ever as we struggle and wait and
fight over the little to do that remains. In the Platinum Era, going
above and beyond the call of duty is listed in the job requirements.
Minimum wage.  Infinite expectation.  Rockstars only, please.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>“<i>'Nothing' really means
'Anything.'”<br/><br/></i>
</h3>
<p>My way to get along isthis: I like to enjoy things. I like to endow
them with my joy. Things always gift me something too--especially
things that don't get enjoyed very often. In my thirty-three years on
earth, I have enjoyed enjoying things so much, I used to get wrapped
up and forget to enjoy myself. This made me sad for a long time even
though I didn't notice.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>“<i>Humility is the new pride.”<br/><br/></i>
</h3>
<p>That's why I'm into singing. See, music is so good for you that,
when your singing, all you can do is enjoy yourself. I stick to
singing about truth so people can stick to loving the truth instead
of fixating on its “creator.” I didn't invent these ideas. I am a
translator, an explorer.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>“<i>Everybody's issue is everybody
is you.”<br/><br/></i>
</h3>
<p>The fact is, I don't feel so comfortable enjoying myself when I
think about people having a hard time enjoying themselves. This is
not a guilt thing. My joy is not made wrong by someone lacking
theirs. It is, however, lessened when it sees absence of joy. My joy
begs to curl up in my pocket, insisting the party hasn't started. She
tells me to wake her up when 70-year-old grasshoppers can afford to
survive the winter without taking out the trash for ants with hills
near picnic tables.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>“<i>No matter who you murder,
you're gonna be you for the rest of your life.”<br/><br/></i>
</h3>
<p>Getting ahead is so important--and so visible--in the Platinum
Era, that it's easy to stay on guard. Doing something as simple as
pulling in front of me in traffic will trigger my sense that you have
cut in line on my journey to, like, “Get Mine.” I have to hate
proof that I'm falling behind. I do my best to remember I really have
it easy, but I do get angry, despite my being clever.  I
hear-tell America is addicted to pharmaceuticals...seems to me we're
addicted to winning. I sure as hell am. I'm so addicted to winning, I
want everybody on this planet doing it at the same time. 
<br/><br/></p>
<h3>“<i>The only way to bring the
whole world to its knees is to do, do, do, do, do: the right thing.”<br/><br/></i>
</h3>
<p>The fastest way to make yourself a winner is to make someone a
loser. I'll admit it, all along I let my subconscious do my dirty
work. It never does work out though.  One day someone makes you
the loser and then you pile on yourself right after, realizing you deserve
it.  Well, you're wrong, alleged loser.  The truth is, the
only losers out there are people who <i>want </i>other people to be
losers. The only lazy folks out there are folks too lazy to
understand what's really behind the death of motivation.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>“<i>Who wants to worship
sacrifice?</i>
</h3>
<h3><i>You've got the sunset in your
eyes...<br/><br/></i></h3>
<p>I've worked full-time jobs for a decade while I supported a
boutique recording career that made me no money. It kept my soul
alive but it assaulted my spirit to make things I loved on the side,
like a thought-crime. I put my heart into a day job whose
expectations quickly crept into my life until I had so little room
left that I felt I had to choose between creating music with
integrity or selling it well.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><i>...Truth is perpetual sunrise.</i></h3>
<h3><i>Why? The Truth is Love.”<br/><br/></i></h3>
<p>At least, I thought I had a choice. By spending all my time
creating, I've kept this music from this world. I've kept these
spirits waiting. Besides, this music needs production. These songs
are dank, funky, my best work ever. I believe these songs are music
that, if done right, you will dance to. To fulfill their potential, I
am asking you to pay me to do this work. My two most recent albums
are free at dashel.com. I'd like this one to be free, too...but to
eat the foods and pay people to work, this time I'm going to need
you.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><i>""Summer is on the way.""<br/><br/></i></h3>
<p>I have made this campaign Flex-Funding because I'm going to record
it whether I can pay for musicians and studio time or not. I have
spent three years writing these careful, direct assaults on my own
self-ignorance, and I plan to take a full month to record them. This
will happen in October. November we mix and master. CDs ship in
December. It's an aggressive goal but a timeline that takes advantage
of being funded. If the funding goal is not achieved, I expect to
have discs in your hands on the morning of April 1, 2016. I am
sufficiently equipped, myself, to manage decent recordings. I have
sources who will work for free. This means I HAVE TO pay them.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><i>My budget is simple ($):<br/><br/></i></h3>
<p>Taking as an unknown variable the exact cost of goods of perk
fulfillment (P), I have built that cost into each perk to guarantee
it affords its own passage. However, the final value will remain
unknowable until the campaign ends and I tally the specific perks,
which have disparate margins. Any money disbursed before the end of
the campaign will have its cost of goods individually set aside, and
only those expenses that are vitally necessary or temporally
advantageous will be undertaken during the campaign. Suffice it to
say for the budget, perk fulfillment is the first and highest
priority, subtracted immediately.</p>
<p>With what remains after setting aside for fulfillment, I will
split the figure at the golden ratio, taking the smaller portion for
my fee (F) (at fully funded by average perk levels this should be
about $4000.00). The larger portion (same conditions, about $7300.00)
will, after setting aside 15% (or $1000) for mastering (M) and 15%
(or $1000) to buffer emergency cost overruns (E), be used as
operational funds (O) and paid to artists, engineers, studios, and
other necessary collaborators as it suits the organic nature of the
recording process. I will make it work with whatever you entrust to
me and I have built this budget dynamically, on proportions that I
will apply universally. Here are some equations for those proportions<br/></p>
<h3><i>$ = P + O + F           O = ($ - P)*.62</i></h3>
<h3><i>F = ($ - P) - O          F = 0.62*O</i></h3>
<h3>
<i>M = 0.15*O              E = 0.15*O</i><br/>
</h3><p>It is my desire to pay people what they are worth and that
includes myself this time. For those who contribute on the $1000.00
and above level, you are buying a certain level of input already, and
I will give authentic audience to your suggestions.<br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>If you have read all of the above and are still reading now, I am
privileged that you did so. Our paths have cross'd, now, anyways. Why
not give in and give, yo? Thank you.</p>

cellist-- a cellist in immediate need. As I put the finishing touches on my
doctoral degree from the Eastman School of Music I am preparing to embark on an
exciting journey as a classically-trained professional cellist. </span></p>
<p align=""left"" style=""text-align: left; line-height: 26.0pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""color: #2A2A2A;"">And almost all the pieces are set in
place: I graduated with distinction from the Cleveland Institute of Music and
Eastman School of Music (where I was awarded the coveted Performer's
Certificate and earned a certificate in Art Leadership and Entrepreneurship),
have been recognized in both national and international competitions, had the pleasure
of performing across three continents (including appearances in Carnegie Hall,
the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and famed halls in Berlin, Germany
and Yokohama, Japan) , and recently accepted work as the Assistant Principal
cellist of the Palm Beach Symphony and cellist for the Broadway Across America
tours. On a personal note, I've met, and married, a beautiful violinist to<a href=""http://www.duo-b.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> perform alongside</a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/dr-phil-s-cello/edit/www.duo-b.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""color: #4CB1B4; text-decoration: none;""></span></a> and we have recently welcomed a son into our lives.
Yet one major element of my career is still uncertain-- I am a cellist without
a cello!</span></p>
<p align=""left"" style=""text-align: left; line-height: 26.0pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""color: #2A2A2A;"">Twelve years ago, I was awarded a
scholarship through a private non-profit organization that provided me with
access to very good instruments. Through that scholarship I have greatly
benefited from being able to play on a number of different cellos including,
two different 18th c. French cellos and a modern American instrument. Currently
I am using a beautiful Czech instrument made by Karel Vavra. These
instruments have been good friends to me and I know I would not be where I am
today had I not had access to these cellos. However, in August my loan
will expire and I will need to return my current cello to its owner. Without my
own instrument to fall back on, and with not enough funds to secure my own
instrument, I am hoping to find an audience willing to assist me in raising the
funds necessary to secure a professional-grade instrument.</span></p>
<p align=""left"" style=""text-align: left; line-height: 26.0pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""color: #2A2A2A;"">Through the exciting and modern
concept of crowdfunding, I hope to offer a unique an personal way to support my
music-making. Any contribution, no matter how small can make a meaningful impact
that will last an entire career. In exchange, every supporter will have a stake
in my project and benefit by exposure to beautiful music.</span></p>

<p align=""left"" style=""margin-bottom: 10.0pt; text-align: left; line-height: 26.0pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""color: #2A2A2A;"">Musicians often speak of the relationship they form with their instrument;
for the cellist, the process is much like building a relationship with another
person. Like a human relationship, the quality of the workmanship has much to
do with the success. Professional-grade cellos are hand-carved from the finest
select woods, carefully crafted by skilled artisans over several months. To
bring out the best in such an instrument, the musician spends countless hours
perfecting his craft, developing the proper way to hold the bow as well as his
fingers in order to produce an exact sound. He learns from the examples of his

</div></div>","Hi! My name is Philip and I am a
cellist-- a cellist in immediate need. As I put the finishing touches on my
doctoral degree from the Eastman School of Music I am preparing to embark on an
exciting journey as a classically-trained professional cellist. 
And almost all the pieces are set in
place: I graduated with distinction from the Cleveland Institute of Music and
Eastman School of Music (where I was awarded the coveted Performer's
Certificate and earned a certificate in Art Leadership and Entrepreneurship),
have been recognized in both national and international competitions, had the pleasure
of performing across three continents (including appearances in Carnegie Hall,
the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and famed halls in Berlin, Germany
and Yokohama, Japan) , and recently accepted work as the Assistant Principal
cellist of the Palm Beach Symphony and cellist for the Broadway Across America
tours. On a personal note, I've met, and married, a beautiful violinist to perform alongside and we have recently welcomed a son into our lives.
Yet one major element of my career is still uncertain-- I am a cellist without
a cello!
Twelve years ago, I was awarded a
scholarship through a private non-profit organization that provided me with
access to very good instruments. Through that scholarship I have greatly
benefited from being able to play on a number of different cellos including,
two different 18th c. French cellos and a modern American instrument. Currently
I am using a beautiful Czech instrument made by Karel Vavra. These
instruments have been good friends to me and I know I would not be where I am
today had I not had access to these cellos. However, in August my loan
will expire and I will need to return my current cello to its owner. Without my
own instrument to fall back on, and with not enough funds to secure my own
instrument, I am hoping to find an audience willing to assist me in raising the
funds necessary to secure a professional-grade instrument.
Through the exciting and modern
concept of crowdfunding, I hope to offer a unique an personal way to support my
music-making. Any contribution, no matter how small can make a meaningful impact
that will last an entire career. In exchange, every supporter will have a stake
in my project and benefit by exposure to beautiful music.
 
Building
a relationship
Musicians often speak of the relationship they form with their instrument;
for the cellist, the process is much like building a relationship with another
person. Like a human relationship, the quality of the workmanship has much to
do with the success. Professional-grade cellos are hand-carved from the finest
select woods, carefully crafted by skilled artisans over several months. To
bring out the best in such an instrument, the musician spends countless hours
perfecting his craft, developing the proper way to hold the bow as well as his
fingers in order to produce an exact sound. He learns from the examples of his
mentors, he listens carefully to their instruction, and he dedicates himself to
being the best he can be.
 Cellist and cello learn how they communicate with and relate to each
other. The musician trains his ear to listen to the instrument’s musical
response.  There are other aesthetics, the cut of the wood, the color of
varnish, and the pattern used by the luthier that can result in an immediate
attraction—or lack thereof—to an instrument.  But the way it resonates,
the “personality” of the instrument, is found in the sonic qualities that
result when played by a particular musician.  Is it rich, dark, sonorous,
or brilliant?  All of these come from playing the cello and learning its
voice.  Like people, no two instruments have the same personality.
 As in personal relationships,
it sometimes takes patience to find the right match.  It is important for
the musician to learn the qualities of the instrument with which he wants to
spend his professional life. 
I am attempting to raise $35,000,
which I understand is a large sum of money. However, with modern cellos being
sold for $45-$100K, the amount I am raising is only a portion of the costs
involved. To date, I have secured $10,000 through my own savings and
fundraising concert and what ever I am able to raise here will be added to
that. I am fortunate to have a fine bow, so the cello is my sole need.
I certainly do not believe that I
should be offered something for nothing. I am working tirelessly to offer
worthwhile and meaningful perks to anyone that is able to assist me towards my
goal.
It
is impossible to underestimate the importance each of my supporters plays in
may career. 
Frequently
Asked Questions
How much does a professional grade cello cost?
This is a very good
question that is very difficult to answer! Like many artists, I’ve often
dreamed of performing on an old Italian instrument and I am fortunate to have
had the immense pleasure of playing on several Stradivarius cellos. However,
the incredible scarcity and beauty of these instruments forces their prices to
greatly exceed any reasonable sum for a musician— selling for millions of
dollars (with new records being set every year). Even the cost of insuring such
an investment is beyond the ability of great artists. Great modern instruments
vary in price from $40,000 to $100,000, which I believe are often the best choice
for a young musician.
What other expenses are
there?
$75 to re-hair a cello bow (normally needed three times yearly)                             $100 three months of instrument insurance                                                                  $300 for a new set of cello strings (recommended twice yearly)                            $500 for a replacement bridge                                                                                       $2,500 for a cello case                                                                                                    $5,000

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hazmatt</span><br/>
</h3> <p>My name is Matt Allen and I front the band Hazmatt. I started the band while living in Lahaina, Maui, Hi and started it again with new members in Encinitas, San Diego when I moved back home. We've been playing for several years all over San Diego, Orange County, and even a little down in Mexico. In 2008 I rushed a quick debut EP just to get something out there to help us book shows. I've never really been stoked on that. I started this campaign because last year Hazmatt got in the studio again with some real material we are proud and passionate about but we were only able to finish one single out of the 6 song EP. The band and I fund the project with the majority being funded by myself. Last year my lady left my daughter and I and I have been a full-time single parent since then with no extra money to spare and this project stuck on indefinite hold. I play music because I love it, it makes me happy, and helps me feed my daughter and I. This new album is very important to us, as we all contributed to writing the songs and we think they are the best we've got to offer. We'd love to get them out there for better or for worse to share or work with our family and friends and hopefully help further our musical endeavor by helping us to book more gigs and tours and help me to possibly give my daughter a better life through the music I love to play.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Goal</h3> <p>We aimed for the low end of what we need. We spent several grand just finishing the single so this is a conservative number actually. Here are the costs associated with finishing the EP:</p> <ul> <li>Recording at LA Lounge Studios is $50 an hour and that's a bargain considering we get two for one in that our sound engineer also offers great production on the songs. We have drums and bass tracked on all songs. We need to track guitar, percussion, keyboards, some horns, and vocals. As another conservative estimate we're probably looking at: 10 hours to finish guitar on 5 songs, 7.5 hours for percussion on 5 songs, 5 hours to finish keys on 5 songs, maybe 1 hour for horns, and roughly 10 hours for vocals on 5 songs. that adds up to roughly 34 hours of just recording time if we work quickly and at a good pace. Let's say that's $1,675 give or take for recording. </li> <li>Mixing and mastering each song is generally around $250 per song for the mix and master.</li> <li>It's $35 per song or $89 per album for digital distribution through CD Baby.</li>
<li>It's $995 for 1,000 packaged CD's in jewel cases with inserts. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We are so proud of this new album and the songs we've written together as a band. Everyone in the band is a family man with children and we love music, but we also depend on the extra income we get for playing gigs. Not only will this album be great for us to be able to release for friends and family in just an artistic sense of completing a project we love, it will also help increase the opportunity of us getting better exposure with a better recording. This new album can potentially help us receive more radio and media exposure as well as open more doors to bigger gigs and festivals and touring. We'd love to be able to travel and spread our music to a larger audience and also help feed our families doing what we love. This is the first time we've attempted a venture like this, as we have always done it on our own and I have personally funded almost all the band's recording and traveling on my own. I'm in a situation where I cannot do it on my own anymore and I don't want to give up. We've been getting great feedback from the only single released off the album so far which has already helped us get one tour and some small local radio play. We're ready to take it to the next level!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The only real risks we face with this project is going over budget and getting stuck again. The good part is with this funding campaign and my other business picking up, I believe we can get it done and if this funding is not enough I will be able to personally make up the difference on my own within the next several months.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We know everyone isn't in the position to give money but there are many other ways to lend support:</p> <ul> <li>Spread the word and share our campaign with your friends and family that may be able to help.</li> <li>Donate goods that we can add as perks to the campaign funders. </li>
<li>Book us to play a show and we can put that money towards the project.</li>
<li>Pass us on to friends that may need a band for an event. We play reggae, rock, hip-hop, dub and much more so we can literally play to almost any crowd.</li>

I play music because I love it, it makes me happy, and helps me feed my daughter and I. This new album is very important to us, as we all contributed to writing the songs and we think they are the best we've got to offer. We'd love to get them out there for better or for worse to share or work with our family and friends and hopefully help further our musical endeavor by helping us to book more gigs and tours and help me to possibly give my daughter a better life through the music I love to play.   Our Goal We aimed for the low end of what we need. We spent several grand just finishing the single so this is a conservative number actually. Here are the costs associated with finishing the EP:  Recording at LA Lounge Studios is $50 an hour and that's a bargain considering we get two for one in that our sound engineer also offers great production on the songs. We have drums and bass tracked on all songs. We need to track guitar, percussion, keyboards, some horns, and vocals. As another conservative estimate we're probably looking at: 10 hours to finish guitar on 5 songs, 7.5 hours for percussion on 5 songs, 5 hours to finish keys on 5 songs, maybe 1 hour for horns, and roughly 10 hours for vocals on 5 songs. that adds up to roughly 34 hours of just recording time if we work quickly and at a good pace. Let's say that's $1,675 give or take for recording.  Mixing and mastering each song is generally around $250 per song for the mix and master. It's $35 per song or $89 per album for digital distribution through CD Baby.
It's $995 for 1,000 packaged CD's in jewel cases with inserts.     The Impact We are so proud of this new album and the songs we've written together as a band. Everyone in the band is a family man with children and we love music, but we also depend on the extra income we get for playing gigs. Not only will this album be great for us to be able to release for friends and family in just an artistic sense of completing a project we love, it will also help increase the opportunity of us getting better exposure with a better recording. This new album can potentially help us receive more radio and media exposure as well as open more doors to bigger gigs and festivals and touring. We'd love to be able to travel and spread our music to a larger audience and also help feed our families doing what we love. This is the first time we've attempted a venture like this, as we have always done it on our own and I have personally funded almost all the band's recording and traveling on my own. I'm in a situation where I cannot do it on my own anymore and I don't want to give up. We've been getting great feedback from the only single released off the album so far which has already helped us get one tour and some small local radio play. We're ready to take it to the next level!   Risks & Challenges  The only real risks we face with this project is going over budget and getting stuck again. The good part is with this funding campaign and my other business picking up, I believe we can get it done and if this funding is not enough I will be able to personally make up the difference on my own within the next several months.   Other Ways You Can Help We know everyone isn't in the position to give money but there are many other ways to lend support:  Spread the word and share our campaign with your friends and family that may be able to help. Donate goods that we can add as perks to the campaign funders. 
Book us to play a show and we can put that money towards the project.
Pass us on to friends that may need a band for an event. We play reggae, rock, hip-hop, dub and much more so we can literally play to almost any crowd.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

 This whole thing started because we have a small record label and we wanted to release some of our back catalog on Vinyl. We searched high and low for someone who would do small runs of records for us. . During this search we came across the DIY Lathe community and decided to get involved. We figured if we owned our own Lathe we could cut records as needed or ""on demand"" which is just what we did. It took us about a year to get the machine set up properly and learn how to consistently cut a good sounding record. During that time we cut many, many, test records while we experimented with and probed every parameter and variable involved in the process.Since then we have cut and sold a bunch of our own 12"" records and 7"" 45's.And then we thought ""we should allow our customers to put together their own  ""Greatest Hits"" album from the music in our catalog""So we did, and they really loved it!And Then we thought ""we should offer to cut 12"" records and 7"" 45's of peoples favorite mix tapes and playlists"".And then  we thought ""we should offer this service to other small record labels and bands""And then we thought ""we'll need money to buy more Record Lathes"".And then we thought ""This is a perfect Crowd Funding kind of situation, let's try Crowd Funding this business idea on IndieGoGo""So here we are.Super Specific Vinyl on Demand                                                         ************Concerning COPYRIGHT protected material and our contract with you:We are not selling music, we are selling a service.You must own a legal copy or be the legal owner of all copyrighted material you send to SSVOD. ""The purpose of The Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 (AHRA) is to ensure the right of consumers to make analog or digital audio recordings of copyrighted music for their private, noncommercial use.""

<div>Those of you who know me know that I've been writing and performing music for over 20 years, and that my music is my life. But enough about me.</div>
<div>Thanks to the efforts of crowd funders like you, I was able to finish my <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/4Ml5bd58zd7aHwtpPKujkO"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2013 <i>Tennessee </i>album</a> and gain some radio traction in Europe. It made it up to #5 on the Euro Americana radio charts. and finished 2013 at #16. As a result, I am embarking on my first ever European tour this fall, and plan to present this new mini EP to fans and radio programmers as my newest work. </div>
<div>The band and I had a bit of studio time on our hands this past fall and we cut some songs we're really proud of. Sometimes a window just opens up and you're able to get something done. </div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432273003/sh1wy3ksnbvssbk6txjh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>This $2000 will go to the mixing of the EP by Joe Costa (Ben Folds, Brendan Benson, Ke$ha), the production by Chris Tench, the mastering, as well as a limited run of physical copies.<br/>
</div>
<div>Your ability to preorder a copy, or multiple copies, means the world to me. Without fan support, attempting to survive in the 2015 musical climate is almost a pointless endeavor. By expanding our audience this fall in Europe, we hope to widen our network and ultimately produce another full length CD in 2016. </div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>We &amp; You</h3> <p>We've done most of the heavy lifting thus far - writing, rehearsing, recording...

<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>A team of talented musicians and I will step into Spyro's Modern Music and Recording Studio in Reading, PA on August 17th, 2015 to record my first EP of original songs. These songs are from my heart and have been in the making for the past 10 years.  This project is hopefully the first of many and your support will make it possible. </p>
<h2>Back Story</h2>
<p>When I was a little girl, I had a strong sense of being deeply loved.  That knowledge gave me courage and a sense of identity. As I grew older, as many of us do, I lost that truth.  I began to write songs about this season of my life, not realizing their future impact and the potential these songs had to reach people who might misunderstand God as Father. These songs started as questions or conversations but soon I realized that someone was talking back. God was talking back. He wanted me to experience Him as Father, to be restored, and to receive His love and grace. This is the Father EP project. This is my story. My hope is that these songs would draw you closer to the heart of the Father.  </p>
<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>My team consists of: co-producer and pianist Lars Pottieger, Sakae drummer Larry Marshall, trumpet player Bob Meashey, The GrooveYard's bassist Louis Rieger, cellist Colin Hartwick, violinist Stephanie Bonk, guitarist John Anthony Seitz, videographer Andres Torres, and countless friends, family and supporters.  </p>
<h2>The Cost</h2>
<p>Creating beautiful music that is well recorded, mixed and mastered is not easy or inexpensive.  All of the funds that are raised will go directly to the production costs of the album.  These costs include: studio time, mixing, mastering, paying the musicians, charting and producing the songs, videography and photography,  manufacturing and printing the CDs, physical and digital distribution, shipping costs and fulfilling the perks.  </p>

me a <b>Maple Blues Award</b> for <b>Female Vocalist of the Year</b>. I did a lot of
road, met a lot of crazy cool people and shared the stage with many great artists.</p>

Its costly to get your name & your music out there.

If this is your first exposure to online crowdfunding, you might be wondering how it works. Well, essentially, by pre-ordering the CD (and/or by purchasing one of the other perks I've created) now rather than after the album is finished, your contribution will allow me to finish making this record and get it out into the world. In return, you'll receive my extreme gratitude, along with a brand new copy of the CD when it's finished! I have some other really cool and fun perks listed as well, so please do take advantage of them! Of course if you’d like to show your support just because, well then hey, thats cool too! 
If you are not comfortable using the Indegogo platform, but would still like to support the project, I understand. It is possible to send a check, e-transfer, or just come see me at the next show and give me your cash and details! I will personally make sure that you receive your perk promptly and sometimes even before the campaign officially ends! You can email me directly here.

Other Ways You Can Help Can't contribute? No problem, you can still help! Please spread the word about this campaign and the new album on your Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Google+, blog or by good old fashioned email. Whatever your preferred method of helping out is, I truly appreciate whatever level of support you're able to give to this project. I consider myself to be super blessed with good friends, a wonderful family, and awesome fans, that have believed in me and my music from the start. I am so looking forward to sharing these songs with you all! 
Thank you for all your love and support. Wishing the best of the Holidays to you and yours!!!

<p>Brought together by a spontaneous musical encounter in 2013,
the three of us have worked to develop a collection of original arrangements for
our unique instrumentation.  The use of tap
dance as percussive element provides a burst of energy to our repertoire of
classical, modern, fiddle, celtic and jazz works.  The violin and double bass both play roles
of melodic importance in these arrangements while also sharing the job of
rhythm keeper with Mark, whose choreography adds an exciting visual spectacle
to live performances. With
the help of a Jack Straw Artist Residency we are currently in the process of
recording our first full length CD, joined by cellist <a href=""http://www.gretchenyanover.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gretchen Yanover </a>on
several tracks.    More than half way through the initial recording
process, we expect to finish most of the recording with the generous 40 hours of
studio time we were granted by <a href=""http://www.jackstraw.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jack Straw</a>.  We are
using this campaign to raise funds to cover the additional production costs by
pre-selling cds.  Your contribution will
help pay for mixing, mastering, mechanical licensing &amp; legal fees, artwork,
printing and pressing. Any additional
funds raised will help with the production of our first music video which is
planned for release in 2016.</p>
<p>Our goal is to finish recording by September 2015 and have
the CD completed and ready to distribute by November 2015.  Listen to a rough mix of Eavesdropper, recorded June 18 with guest artist Gretchen Yanover, cello.</p>

<p>Hey y’all, Kathryn Legendre here, coming to you from my home in Austin, TX. That’s because, this summer, I’m heading into the studio to record a new EP and put out my very own vinyl 7”. Don’t worry, in addition, I’ll also put out a CD with the same songs, plus bonus material. I know this isn’t your typical sort of release, but I’ve never been that kind of a girl anyway.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Where I've Been</h3> <p>When I'm not recording music, I'm still making music. Below are a few experiences I've had since releasing my debut record. In their own ways, each event has added an ingredient to the new songs I've been cooking up:</p> <ul> <li>Press in in <i>Lone Star Music</i> magazine and <i>Texas Music</i> magazine</li> <li>Nominated for Female Vocalist of the Year award at the 12th Annual Texas Music Awards (2014)</li> <li>2014 Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk Regional Performer at Ballad Tree</li>
<li>Texas Music Water’s July 2014 “Musician of the Month”</li>
<li>Top 15 finalist at 2015 Songwriters Serenade competition<br/>
</li>
</ul> <p>Believe me, not a day goes by where I’m not thankful that I get to chase the music that’s in my head. The support I’ve received has already been so overwhelming, so I’m hoping you’ll be just as excited as I am to take the next step in my journey. </p>

<p>In July, I’m getting the band back together and recording at the renowned, <a href=""http://www.cedarcreekrecording.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cedar Creek Studio</a> in South Austin with John Ross Silva behind the boards. He’s engineered, produced and contributed to records for Randy Rogers, Hays Carll, Hal Ketchum, Wade Bowen, and more, so I’m incredibly honored he’s signed on for my new EP. I’m also excited to show you a new batch of material. I released by debut album, <i>Old Soul</i> in 2013, and then a single, <i>Have You Forgotten Me</i>, last year. In that time, I’ve made a lot of strides. I’ve turned songwriting into more than just a hobby, playing shows, learning to play guitar, and maturing as a songwriter. I’m eager to share a musical slice of life with you, so I hope you’re hungry!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need</h3> <p>Here’s where you come in: I hate asking for help, but the truth is, I need it.

</div><p>Hi
my name is Habs. I am an industry-leading Visual Artist, often referred to as a VJ, I'm responsible for the content you see on the screens
at clubs, gigs and festivals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I
have been in the exciting dance music industry for over 18 years and
worked at amazing events such as Glastonbury Festival, Ultra Music
Festival and many club nights, with high profile DJ’s like Carl Cox
at Space Ibiza, Lisa Lashes, Paul Van Dyk, Ferry Corston and bands including Nine
Inch Nails and Pet Shop Boys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having
partied all over the world and worked with some of the biggest names
in the dance music industry, I am developing a world-first app designed
to bring visual mixing to the masses and allow everyone with a phone to have a chance to be a VJ.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My
job allows me to offer some unique perks for you dance music lovers:  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>
How
about some real VIP treatment at a leading dance event or joining me
in the DJ box for the night in Ibiza? Plus we've got cool app related perks and a mega saver app pack for just £10. Then “It's all about the Goodness” T-shirts and
way of life.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437750278/cbdhkyji8oozirtownt7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437750305/fpgegicziujjsjlnmuul.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Working with Carl Cox at Ultra Music Festival Miami 2014</i><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><u><b>Why
am I here on Indiegogo?</b></u></p>
<p>I've wanted to develop my own visualisation software for quite
some time now and have recently added people to the team to complete
the project. We are nearly there, but we need funding to finish the app. I'm seeking GBP 30,000 to help fund the launch version of DJVJ as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DJVJ
is a one-of-a-kind, a cool little visualisation app currently in beta for
iPhone and iPad with an Android version to follow. For five pounds you can get access to the DJVJ beta within 72 hours of the end of this campaign and help me test the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as I said, I've
wanted to develop my own visualisation software for over a decade,
and over the last seven years mobile device take up has really exploded. And with the improved technology it has allowed my vision for a product to gradually take shape. I now
want to develop something that's simple to use and can reach the
largest amount of people possible. I want to bring visual mixing to

tell you. When I first hit the dance floor in the UK in the late 1980's
I didn't quite realize just how big and how global dance music would

myself. But everywhere I have gone in the world to dance and party,
in every corner of the globe there's been love and people being good
to each other. From the stories I've been told to acts of outstanding
generosity and kindness I have witnessed. We are a global family and

</div>
</div></div>","Hi
my name is Habs. I am an industry-leading Visual Artist, often referred to as a VJ, I'm responsible for the content you see on the screens
at clubs, gigs and festivals.

I
have been in the exciting dance music industry for over 18 years and
worked at amazing events such as Glastonbury Festival, Ultra Music
Festival and many club nights, with high profile DJ’s like Carl Cox
at Space Ibiza, Lisa Lashes, Paul Van Dyk, Ferry Corston and bands including Nine
Inch Nails and Pet Shop Boys.

Having
partied all over the world and worked with some of the biggest names
in the dance music industry, I am developing a world-first app designed
to bring visual mixing to the masses and allow everyone with a phone to have a chance to be a VJ.

My
job allows me to offer some unique perks for you dance music lovers:  
How
about some real VIP treatment at a leading dance event or joining me
in the DJ box for the night in Ibiza? Plus we've got cool app related perks and a mega saver app pack for just £10. Then “It's all about the Goodness” T-shirts and
way of life.Working with Carl Cox at Ultra Music Festival Miami 2014

Why
am I here on Indiegogo?
I've wanted to develop my own visualisation software for quite
some time now and have recently added people to the team to complete
the project. We are nearly there, but we need funding to finish the app. I'm seeking GBP 30,000 to help fund the launch version of DJVJ as soon as possible.

DJVJ
is a one-of-a-kind, a cool little visualisation app currently in beta for
iPhone and iPad with an Android version to follow. For five pounds you can get access to the DJVJ beta within 72 hours of the end of this campaign and help me test the app.

So as I said, I've
wanted to develop my own visualisation software for over a decade,
and over the last seven years mobile device take up has really exploded. And with the improved technology it has allowed my vision for a product to gradually take shape. I now
want to develop something that's simple to use and can reach the
largest amount of people possible. I want to bring visual mixing to
the masses!

DJVJ will be as flexible as possible, currently we have iPhone and iPad versions in development with Android to follow and we'd like to do a PC/Mac version too. DJVJ can not only be plugged in to any screen at a small
venue but also at main stage screens, and it has the ability to
output Audio too. This technology makes the DJVJ project truly a one of a
kind!
I have also created a massive library of animations and visuals with 1000's
of images that can be mixed in real time.With DJVJ I want to give up-and-coming bands and DJ's a very low cost visual solution, while at the same time offering visual artists a platform to sell their work.You can see an on screen demo of the DJVJ App working below. (Check the navigation buttons on the left and the sliders at the bottom. When a next video, next foreground button is selected you can see the text on the button grey out). You can now see just how badly we need an updated user interface for DJVJ!Tell us more
about the technology behind DJVJ?

DJVJ is using the iOS Audio Unit Framework, this is the lowest
latency method possible of capturing audio samples from the
microphone, line in, or music playing on the device. This will
ultimately result in a smoother, more responsive visualisation. This
is broken down in to frequency bands using a Fast Fourier Transform,
different elements of the visualisation could therefore respond only
to lows or highs for example.I'm really looking forward to getting lots of beta testers involved in shaping the future of DJVJ's development and I can't wait to hear your ideas for features.
So,
why do I need your help?
At
this stage I find myself at the final milestone of development
with the back-end architecture complete and just the front end user
experience left. This is why I'm here on Indiegogo, seeking
support from the community and beyond, and sharing my visionary
project with the world.

BUT, more
importantly, I NEED YOUR FEEDBACK. The app is at a great stage of
development and the product is working well, but it needs refining so
that it is easy to use and pleasing to the eye. By supporting my campaign you'll get Beta access to DJVJ, so you can
help with the development of the front end and provide
suggestions for new features. You'll also be able to help to stress
test the app and report back any bugs or issues you come across. I'll be setting up a beta tester forum to help with communications.

The
funds raised will enable me to complete the final stage with a
dynamic front end user experience including social sharing and
location based features. I'm led to believe the devs will need around 8 weeks
after reaching the funding goal to submit the production version of DJVJ to
Apple and later on to Google.

Marketing
is always a key factor to the success of any project and all your
support will allow the app to reach as wide an audience as possible. Working with the lovely DJ Lisa Lashes earlier this year.

What
happens if I don't reach the funding goal?
I will just carry on but it's going to take longer than the 8 weeks predicted and may not hit the store until 2016, which would be a shame.

My Argentinean friends call me Ruso. I am a musician (singer and songwriter) and a filmmaker (writer - director), and I am as passionate about music as I am passionate about Argentina, especially its arts and culture, and above all its magical MUSIC! After a break from recording and performing, this year I am making a comeback with the songs that I MUST sing, these are the stories that I must tell! In spring of 2015 I started the project by recording two songs from the great Argentine Songbook - Milonga Triste (a tango) and Memorias de uno Vieja Canción, my homage to the great musician from that country - Horacio Guarany. The latter has the total of 2300 plays (and growing) being streamed on SoundCloud and YouTube. In October 2015 I had the honor of performing those songs LIVE at an event in Philadelphia City Hall, as part of the Argentine Week in Philadelphia. The reception was overwhelming, and convinced me in something I KNEW I desired from the very start - a complete ALBUM of the greatest songs of my beautiful Argentina, titled the way my maxi single was named - ""Argentino de Alma"" should be recorded in its entirety. </p>
<p>It will include 7 cover versions of the masterpieces of Argentine songwriting through the various eras, freshly arranged, as well as 3 of my original songs in Spanish. To me singing in Argentinean Spanish is more than pleasure, it is part of my mission to promote the culture of Argentina worldwide - through performing, through sharing the music. Living in a small Pennsylvania town, close to Philadelphia and working hard in something a bit left of artsy, I have been saving every penny to make the first 2 recordings happen by capturing my vocals in my home studio, and then sending them to Russia, to my friend - producer and collaborator Victor Romanov, who engaged wonderful live musicians, arranged and recorded, mixed and mastered the final polished versions. This proved an economical and artistically fulfilling collaboration, and we have discussed in detail the rest of the future album. </p>
<p>However, I am not able to fully finance such an undertaking, and I must get it all RIGHT - with live instruments, in a professional studio. I am a perfectionist when it comes to music making. I simply do not have the financial resource to get this done - to do justice to the songs, which are all gems of Latin music. This is why I absolutely need you all on board! I invite you to be part of an exciting process of music-making!</p>

<p>1. $3700 is the actual budget of the recording (considering I record the vocals in my home studio in Trevose) - the money goes to the session musicians, studio sessions (they are much cheaper in Perm, Russia, where the things will be happening) and all that jazz necessary to arrange, record, mix and master 8 full songs.</p>
<p>2. The perks I will provide you with, the fees (Indiegogo, Bank) and the taxes (as stipulated by US law) will ""eat up"" a chunk of the budget and are estimated at $800.</p>
<p>3. The rest of the sum - $500 - is the copyright cost, to get the rights to the remaining 5 covers, so that their authors get honored and paid - they deserve it!</p>
<p>I promise updates, unique content (including alternative takes, pictures from the studio etc.), and the cool perks, such as: postcards, T-shirts, special autographed edition of the CD itself, posters and even an all-private performance - that is if someone is crazy generous. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I know we are all overfed and skeptical, ""oh, well, another indie musician""... but I believe that the songs that I want to revive are WORTH the public's attention and the public's LOVE. I want to promote a beautiful, diverse culture and bring a gorgeous South American country close to the rest of the world. I am a devoted artist, and I will give my all to this mission of mine - bringing Argentina through music to the people who know it and love it, to those who remember it and miss it, and to those who will be thrilled to discover it.</p>
<p>In case the project is not fully financed, depending on the funds raised, I have 2 options:</p>
<p>a. Record however many songs I have the funds for. This will bring my closer to my goal anyways.</p>
<p>b. Self-finance the gap, and finish the project anyway!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There is one challenge at this point - the budget (or lack thereof) - the creative and logistical ones have all been resolved. The musicians have already been contacted, the studio pre-booked.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Spread the word! Spread the word! Tell about this album, tell about me, tell about this campaign. I do not endorse crazy ""all over the place"" sharing that drives people insane and makes them unfriend one, but I believe that when shared in the right place (a music lover's wall or a Latin or Latin music or Argentine community) it is fruitful!

<p>This winter I am recording my third full-length album,<b><i> I Believe We Are Safe </i></b>- an exciting collection of brand new original songs played on the banjo, kalimba, and piano - with lots of other musicians joining on string bass, fiddle, guitar, hand percussion, harmonica, and harmony vocals!</p>
<p>Like my last album, <i>For Everything That's Good</i> [2014], this one will be full of the <b>relentlessly positive acoustic folk-soul</b> that people from all around have been growing to love.  I would be honored to have your support in making these new songs into timeless recordings.</p>
<p>The response to my music over the last year has been extremely encouraging: people of all ages - babies, children, teenagers, adults, and elders - seem to find something nourishing in these notes and words.  It's something that gets them dancing when they haven't felt like moving, singing along when they haven't shared their voice in years, and smiling with hope in the midst of challenges.</p>

<p><b></b></p><h3><b>Sharing the Music</b></h3><p></p>
<p>Having taken the year off from growing food, I have been able to devote much more time to performing around the community and around the country, and writing new songs.  </p>
<p>Besides the joy of knowing my voice is serenading folks in cars and kitchens all over the world, I feel extremely lucky to get to add music to celebrations that are truly in line with my personal vision for an awesome world that we share - celebrations such as Floyd Yoga Jam, Ithaca's Herbal Hoedown, The Good Life Farm's Asparagus Festival, Twisted Tree's Nut Bonanza, Farmers Markets, Plant Sales, Fundraisers, Earth Days, Churches, Funerals, Weddings, Baby Showers, Circuses, The Kava Lounge, Community Radio, Book Talks, Porchfest, Bound for Glory, House Concerts, and my ""Lean-to Tour"" of the Finger Lakes Trail.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447484030/lmbywe8jkeaohwciynjx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>I intend to keep adding my songs to local celebrations and ceremonies, while also traveling to similar gatherings around the US and abroad, to be a ""pollinator"" of positive ideas and optimistic music!  Your contribution to this album directly supports this empowering pollination!</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>Budget</b></h3><p></p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of the budget:</p>
<p><i>    Studio time [recording, mixing, and mastering]</i> = $2,300</p>
<p><i>                                                                             Musicians</i> = $1,500</p>
<p><i>                                     CD Printing + Graphic Design </i>= $1,700</p>
<p>  <i>                                       Artwork [artist and printing]</i> = $1,000</p>
<p><b>      <i>                                                               </i>  TOTAL = $6,500</b></p>
<p>For the last two albums, I recorded mostly with my own equipment, and did most of the performing on them.  <i>I Believe We Are Safe</i> will be recorded at REP Studio in Ithaca (<a href=""http://www.repstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.repstudio.com</a>), and it will feature many talented local musicians to bring the songs to life.  Nate Silas Richardson (Samite, John Brown's Body, Sim Redmond Band, Black Castle) will again be lending the magic of his ears at REP, as well as adding some of his musical stylings.  Other musicians will include Desmond Bratton (string bass), Elisa Sciscioli (vocals), Nate Marshall (guitar), Tenzin Chopak (guitar and vocals), Angie Beeler (vocals), Chris Gerard (percussion and vocals), Jon Crawford (harmonica), and Steve Selin (fiddle) - plus several more special guests!</p>
<p>Artwork will again be provided by the extremely talented Linda Wingerter (aka Polly Sonic).  Whenever I hand someone <i>Bright New Way</i> or<i> For Everything That's Good,</i> the first thing they say is ""Wow, it's beautiful!"" - and they're of course referring to Linda's extraordinary paintings and drawings.  She has really shaped the visual aesthetic of Travis Knapp music, and it's quite exciting to think of what artwork is yet up her sleeve!!</p>

<p>
</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>Risks and Challenges</b></h3><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This is a fairly low-risk endeavor.  Having gone through the full process of album-making a couple times now, I'm confident that all the steps - from the music creation and recording, to putting the physical CD together - will go rather smoothly.  The time frame is achievable, and twice as long as the last two productions were.</p><p>The biggest challenge will be getting the album into the ears of people beyond our immediate community of fans, friends, and family - to folks who will be glad to listen and feel supported in their hopeful view of the world!  We're planning to send this to folk radio shows and transformational festivals around the country, to spread the music and set the stage for future live performances.</p><p>
</p><p>If we raise less than $4,500, this album simply cannot happen - I am committed to making a great-sounding album.  <i>For Everything That's Good</i> took $3,500 [with minimal in-studio recording and very few other musicians], and I would additionally need to get a new well-functioning computer to be able to record everything at home again.  If we raise between $4,500 and $6,500, it will mean fewer guest musicians and more recording outside of the studio.  If we <b>surpass </b>the goal of $6,500, it will mean more (properly-paid) guest musicians, and more studio time to refine the songs.  If we surpass the goal by at least $2,000, there will be a record pressing of <i>For Everything That's Good </i>or <i>I Believe We Are Safe </i>on vinyl!</p>

<p><b></b></p><h3><b>Other Ways to Help</b></h3><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Even if you aren't able to contribute financially right now (and also if you are), you can be extremely helpful to this campaign by telling someone you love about this upcoming album!  Get the word out on social media - facebook, twitter, instagram, etc.  A simple ""share"" can go a long way.  A note or conversation with a friend in person can go even farther!  If you're local to Ithaca, NY, come out to hear some performances - including an album fundraiser party at Sacred Root Kava Lounge &amp; Tea Bar on December 5th.  There will be a CD release concert in the spring, also in Ithaca!</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>Let's grow old together ...</b></h3><p></p>
<p><i>I Believe We Are Safe</i> will be an honest and soul-stirring album of catchy and energizing songs that you can sing and dance to anywhere.   I hope you find it inspiring and nourishing.  These lyrics are full of reminders to myself of what I want to help create in this world, and how beautiful life can be.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continual support, encouragement, feedback, and connection to these songs, to bring them to life as a conversation and shared experience.  Time and time again we find that we have the power to lift each other up.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Many Blessings,</p>

<p><i>I've been getting some feedback from people that the title <i>""I Believe We Are Safe"" </i>seems out of touch and insensitive - at least when it's taken out of the context of the song lyrics from which it came.  People have suggested that I remove the word ""Safe"" from the title, in light of world affairs.  So I'll articulate this a little more:</i></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p>When I say ""Safe,"" <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">as in, ""I believe we are safe,"" </span></p>
<p>I'm talking about a place <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">that's higher than, or deeper than, or </span></p>
<p>Beyond physical and emotional safety.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now, I don't have my head in the sand, here - </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I understand what horrible things are going on.</span></p>
<p>In spite of what's happening <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">all around us in this world, </span></p>
<p>There's a part of our existence, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">of our consciousness, </span></p>
<p>That is <b>eternally</b> in a place of safety and peace.</p>
<p>… This is what I <b>believe</b>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It's a provocative phrase for just this reason - <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">that folks are gonna say:</span></p>
<p>  ""Look, this group of people is <i>definitely</i> <b>not</b> safe,"" and </p>
<p>  ""<i>My</i> experience has not been one of safety in <i>these</i> situations ...</p>
<p>   ""<i>How</i> can you <i>say</i> that?!  How can you say we are <i>safe</i>??</p>
<p>    ""You sit in such a place of <i>privilege </i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">as a young educated straight white male </span></p>

<p><b>That</b> is where I believe we are safe.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>UPDATE, 12/6: After much deliberation and introspection, and a whole lot of great conversation with great people, I've decided to reopen the door on what to call the album.  Although I still feel strongly that ""We Are Safe"" on a spiritual level, there are more important reasons for making and sharing this music than my own need to make a strong statement.</p>
<p>The truth is that lots of folks hear the words ""I believe we are safe"" and assume I am delusional or in denial or out of touch with the world, or at least very privileged.  This could very well lead to someone turning away and ignoring all the music behind the title, thus missing any medicine it may have contained for them within.  Above all else, I want for this album to be unifying and empowering for as many people as possible.</p>
<p>So thank you for coming along for the journey, as the crafting of this album becomes more of a community process - which is awesome, because ultimately, it's this community that will be giving life to the music by listening to it for years to come!  Please be in touch if you have any thoughts, ideas, or feelings on the album title, (or anything else about it for that matter), and thank you to everyone who already has entered into this heartfelt discussion.</p>
<p>Here are some title possibilities, mostly taken from the song lyrics: ""Come Home,"" ""All the Stars You Hold,"" ""Gather,"" ""And We Lifted Up Our Spirits All The Same,"" ""Thank You For Your Song,"" ""Closer to the Truth,"" ""As Family Gathers,"" ""I Believe We Are Safe,"" ""Safe,"" ""We Got This Far""</p>

</div></div>","12/26 - THANK YOU ALL!!  We made 85% of the goal, which is enough to get moving on the album.  Continuing contributions will be accepted through email - travknapper3@gmail.com (paypal, etc), with all the same perks available!Check out all the tshirts:- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
This winter I am recording my third full-length album, I Believe We Are Safe - an exciting collection of brand new original songs played on the banjo, kalimba, and piano - with lots of other musicians joining on string bass, fiddle, guitar, hand percussion, harmonica, and harmony vocals!
Like my last album, For Everything That's Good [2014], this one will be full of the relentlessly positive acoustic folk-soul that people from all around have been growing to love.  I would be honored to have your support in making these new songs into timeless recordings.
The response to my music over the last year has been extremely encouraging: people of all ages - babies, children, teenagers, adults, and elders - seem to find something nourishing in these notes and words.  It's something that gets them dancing when they haven't felt like moving, singing along when they haven't shared their voice in years, and smiling with hope in the midst of challenges.


""When I'm gone, May they say I was too joyfulMay they say I understood the painOf everyone who struggles on this journeyAnd we lifted up our spirits all the same""                                                       - from the new song ""Humble""
What People are Saying
""Travis Knapp is a brilliant musician with a resonant voice.  His songs are uplifting and strong, kindling a sense of hope and optimism.  He is very impressive.""
                          - Starhawk (Activist and author of ""The Fifth Sacred Thing"")
""Phrases were going through my head, like, ""The voice of a generation,"" and ""The new Pete Seeger."" I imagine you've heard these compliments before, so I add my voice to them.  Also, I feel that people especially like music like yours when they can admire and respect the person behind the music. Your values, your honesty, and your love of life, the earth, and people, shine through.""
                            - Judith Hendin (www.consciousbody.com)
""We met you at LEAF and you gave us your album as a trade for juice from our stand. We played the album on the ride back to town and were amazed at the quality and sound. Travis Knapp is an amazingly talented musician and an underrated gem that will surely be making big waves very soon! Sooo good!""
                             - Zack and Jenni (Roaming in the Raw)



Perks
Check out the perks for supporting, which are over on the right-hand side of this page.  There are various levels at which to give, to get this CD in your hands and in your ears - plus banjo t-shirts (""for everything that's good, become a defender""), posters, stickers, house concerts (solo and band), an original song for you, a wild foods and medicines care package, and a package of music and artwork that can arrive in time for holiday season gift-giving (w/o the new CD, of course, which won't be ready until Spring!).
The Songs
Here are most of the songs planned for the album (there will be at least 10):
""Mama"" - a new favorite singalong, 30-year retrospective, and intention-setting
""Humble"" - a prayerful song written on kalimba in the mountains near Asheville, NC
""Safe"" - a powerful declaration of our inherent goodness and power to create
""Lila"" - a song for my niece (a result of the last Indiegogo campaign's ""A Song for You"" perk)
""If You Want to Call Me Darlin'"" - a light-hearted invitation
""The Grasshoppers and The Ants"" - a pro-music and arts interpretation of the famous fable
""Toward the One"" - a unifying chant
""Dancer"" - heart-opening story of a woman who follows her passion beyond her physical limits
""Spring"" - a song of hope from the early spring thaw
Sharing the Music
Having taken the year off from growing food, I have been able to devote much more time to performing around the community and around the country, and writing new songs.  
Besides the joy of knowing my voice is serenading folks in cars and kitchens all over the world, I feel extremely lucky to get to add music to celebrations that are truly in line with my personal vision for an awesome world that we share - celebrations such as Floyd Yoga Jam, Ithaca's Herbal Hoedown, The Good Life Farm's Asparagus Festival, Twisted Tree's Nut Bonanza, Farmers Markets, Plant Sales, Fundraisers, Earth Days, Churches, Funerals, Weddings, Baby Showers, Circuses, The Kava Lounge, Community Radio, Book Talks, Porchfest, Bound for Glory, House Concerts, and my ""Lean-to Tour"" of the Finger Lakes Trail.
I intend to keep adding my songs to local celebrations and ceremonies, while also traveling to similar gatherings around the US and abroad, to be a ""pollinator"" of positive ideas and optimistic music!  Your contribution to this album directly supports this empowering pollination!

Budget
Here's the breakdown of the budget:
    Studio time [recording, mixing, and mastering] = $2,300
                                                                             Musicians = $1,500
                                     CD Printing + Graphic Design = $1,700
                                         Artwork [artist and printing] = $1,000
                                                                       TOTAL = $6,500
For the last two albums, I recorded mostly with my own equipment, and did most of the performing on them.  I Believe We Are Safe will be recorded at REP Studio in Ithaca (www.repstudio.com), and it will feature many talented local musicians to bring the songs to life.  Nate Silas Richardson (Samite, John Brown's Body, Sim Redmond Band, Black Castle) will again be lending the magic of his ears at REP, as well as adding some of his musical stylings.  Other musicians will include Desmond Bratton (string bass), Elisa Sciscioli (vocals), Nate Marshall (guitar), Tenzin Chopak (guitar and vocals), Angie Beeler (vocals), Chris Gerard (percussion and vocals), Jon Crawford (harmonica), and Steve Selin (fiddle) - plus several more special guests!
Artwork will again be provided by the extremely talented Linda Wingerter (aka Polly Sonic).  Whenever I hand someone Bright New Way or For Everything That's Good, the first thing they say is ""Wow, it's beautiful!"" - and they're of course referring to Linda's extraordinary paintings and drawings.  She has really shaped the visual aesthetic of Travis Knapp music, and it's quite exciting to think of what artwork is yet up her sleeve!!

Risks and Challenges


This is a fairly low-risk endeavor.  Having gone through the full process of album-making a couple times now, I'm confident that all the steps - from the music creation and recording, to putting the physical CD together - will go rather smoothly.  The time frame is achievable, and twice as long as the last two productions were.The biggest challenge will be getting the album into the ears of people beyond our immediate community of fans, friends, and family - to folks who will be glad to listen and feel supported in their hopeful view of the world!  We're planning to send this to folk radio shows and transformational festivals around the country, to spread the music and set the stage for future live performances.
If we raise less than $4,500, this album simply cannot happen - I am committed to making a great-sounding album.  For Everything That's Good took $3,500 [with minimal in-studio recording and very few other musicians], and I would additionally need to get a new well-functioning computer to be able to record everything at home again.  If we raise between $4,500 and $6,500, it will mean fewer guest musicians and more recording outside of the studio.  If we surpass the goal of $6,500, it will mean more (properly-paid) guest musicians, and more studio time to refine the songs.  If we surpass the goal by at least $2,000, there will be a record pressing of For Everything That's Good or I Believe We Are Safe on vinyl!





Other Ways to Help


Even if you aren't able to contribute financially right now (and also if you are), you can be extremely helpful to this campaign by telling someone you love about this upcoming album!  Get the word out on social media - facebook, twitter, instagram, etc.  A simple ""share"" can go a long way.  A note or conversation with a friend in person can go even farther!  If you're local to Ithaca, NY, come out to hear some performances - including an album fundraiser party at Sacred Root Kava Lounge & Tea Bar on December 5th.  There will be a CD release concert in the spring, also in Ithaca!

Let's grow old together ...
I Believe We Are Safe will be an honest and soul-stirring album of catchy and energizing songs that you can sing and dance to anywhere.   I hope you find it inspiring and nourishing.  These lyrics are full of reminders to myself of what I want to help create in this world, and how beautiful life can be.
Thank you for your continual support, encouragement, feedback, and connection to these songs, to bring them to life as a conversation and shared experience.  Time and time again we find that we have the power to lift each other up.

Many Blessings,
Travis


""Well, I'm grown up, Mama, doing right by you
Living hard like you taught me to do
I've got no regrets, only unpaid debts
For all the kindness from people like you""
                                                     -from the new song ""Mama""



www.travisknapp.com
I've been getting some feedback from people that the title ""I Believe We Are Safe"" seems out of touch and insensitive - at least when it's taken out of the context of the song lyrics from which it came.  People have suggested that I remove the word ""Safe"" from the title, in light of world affairs.  So I'll articulate this a little more:

When I say ""Safe,"" as in, ""I believe we are safe,"" 
I'm talking about a place that's higher than, or deeper than, or 
Beyond physical and emotional safety.

Now, I don't have my head in the sand, here - 
I understand what horrible things are going on.
In spite of what's happening all around us in this world, 
There's a part of our existence, of our consciousness, 
That is eternally in a place of safety and peace.
… This is what I believe.

It's a provocative phrase for just this reason - that folks are gonna say:
  ""Look, this group of people is definitely not safe,"" and 
  ""My experience has not been one of safety in these situations ...
   ""How can you say that?!  How can you say we are safe??
    ""You sit in such a place of privilege as a young educated straight white male 
        in the United States of America.""

But this isn't about me, it's not about you, it's not about anyone 
As an individual, or as a human being.
It's the Watcher, it's the Soul, it's God, it's Love,
It's the Universe, it's the Creator, it's that which knows, 
It's the tiniest tiniest part,  and the most vast, all-encompassing entirety - 
Whatever you call it, 
That is where I believe we are safe.


UPDATE, 12/6: After much deliberation and introspection, and a whole lot of great conversation with great people, I've decided to reopen the door on what to call the album.  Although I still feel strongly that ""We Are Safe"" on a spiritual level, there are more important reasons for making and sharing this music than my own need to make a strong statement.

<h3><b>ANNE OF THE WOLVES<br/></b></h3>
<p></p> <i>(Have a listen to ""Blue and Black"" or other songs from my debut EP, ""Rainmaker."" )</i><a href=""https://www.reverbnation.com/anneofthewolves"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">  </a><br/>    <br/><a href=""https://www.reverbnation.com/anneofthewolves"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anne of the Wolves - Blue &amp; Black</a><br/>
<br/><p><b><i><b>Hello! Do you have a minute?</b></i></b><br/></p>
<p>Hello, thank you for visiting!  I'm Anne of the Wolves.  I'm a singer and songwriter from Melbourne, Australia and I'm hoping to get my album produced with a little help from my friends.  <br/></p>
<p>As you can hear, I'm pretty lucky to already have an absolutely 
cracking band of musicians behind me and together we have created what we are calling <b>melodramatic gypsy-folk 
jazz-noir, </b>a sound that we adore playing together.  You can probably hear the fun we're having at the end of Blue &amp; Black!  <br/></p>
<p><b>I am so proud of my band and I couldn't be happier or more eager to share our creation with you!</b><br/></p>
<p>In 
order to do that, though, I do need some help to fund the recording and production of 
our <b>debut album and single - ""Triffids And Trees.""</b><br/></p>
<p>If you have a few minutes, I'll explain a little bit more... <br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>The Crazy Truth Behind The Music <br/>
</b></h3>Those of you who've already seen or heard an <b>Anne of the Wolves</b> performance know that the songs are pretty dark.  Even the happy or fun, loud stomping songs can have a real melancholy in the lyrics.<br/><br/>This is because all my music comes from one big influence in my life:<br/><br/><b>I have suffered anxiety and depression since I was 14 years old</b>. <br/><br/>For a long, LONG time, I had no idea why I felt the way I did.  I have been bullied a lot as a result and the piano has been my friend when I've felt I've had no one else.  </div><div>
<p><b>The song, ""Triffids &amp; Trees"" </b>has lyrics which embody exactly how I feel when the darkness takes me; </p>
<b><i>""I'm running to the wind, pushing me back. <br/>I'm running to the wind, coloured in black. <br/>Listen....the fog.""</i></b><br/><br/>Writing songs has always been my way of expressing the overwhelming sadness, livid black anger or intense illogical fear that can come without warning to anyone struggling with anxiety or living with depression.   And it seems I'm not alone!  Since coming out about my own troubles, it's become apparent that many of us are suffering from a mental 
health issue these days.  Perhaps this is why people seem to be 
connecting with <b>Anne of the Wolves</b>' music?  <br/><br/>It's hard admitting there's something wrong,<b> but thanks to my wonderful band</b>, I do feel I've been able to finally bring myself out from among the triffids and into the trees, as it were, and this is what the album is all about.    <br/><p></p>
</div> <div> <br/><h3>The Album To Be!<br/>
</h3> <p><br/><b>""Triffids And Trees"", </b>the album, is one big musical story of the many emotional paths traveled through these last few years of my struggle - a particularly rough time when a nearly decade long relationship was failing.  <br/></p>
<p>The hopeful highs and absolute crushing lows, the trauma that I'm still battling to this day from being bullied and excluded by close 'friends'.  It's all there in this album.  I am very proud of it.  <br/></p>
<p>And funnily enough, it's not all dark and depressing, given the subject matter!  Some of the songs are quite uplifting and downright fun!  The gypsy-honky-tonk number, ""Louisiana Swamp Stomp"" says to get moving and just be yourself and to hell with those who want to quash your spirit!<i><b><b><i><br/></i></b></b></i></p>
<p><i><b><b><i>       ""</i></b></b></i><i><b>Dance like you're going to die. We're all going to die!</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>    NO! You know you ain't going to die, doing the Louisiana Swamp Stomp!""</b></i><br/></p>
<p>Or as my Gran would say, ""Buck up and don't let the bastards get you down!""  <br/></p>
<p>I'm so excited about this album, I cannot wait for you to hear it!</p>
<p>You'll hear the full scale talent of my band as well, as it's their musicianship that adds that snarling, full-bodied, hot-blooded, wonderfully epic dynamic to <b>Anne of the Wolves</b>.  <br/><br/>And as <b>Anne of the Wolves</b> keeps performing and the music keeps connecting with people, I am starting to realize that <b>if something so beautiful can come out of something so dark like depression - then I <i>can</i> and WILL keep living with it!</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>And gladly! </b><br/><br/></p>
<h3>THE FUNDS<br/>
</h3>
Of course, to help make this project a reality - I do need some help.  <br/>I self-funded the first EP,<b> ""Rainmaker""</b> which was a rewarding experience of course but an album, single and video is a WAY bigger project and I simply can't do it alone! <br/><br/>I would be so grateful if you could pledge even just a little to help me on my way.  <br/><br/>There are so many perks you can get! You get something even if you pledge as little as $5!  And everything you donate will go towards the following:   <br/><br/><b>Recording</b> - with <b>Tomas Strode (from PBS Live!)</b> - This is complete! We had a dynamite weekend with Tom and recorded 9 songs over about one and a half days! Thank you, Tom! <br/><br/><b>Mixing/ Production</b> - with <b>Myles Mumford</b> (aka Mr Excellent).<br/><br/><b>Mastering</b>, <b>printing</b> and <b>pressing</b> of 1000 CD's for the album and 500 for the single (with possibly some vinyl if we go over our goal!)<br/><br/><b>Artwork </b>for the cover - designed by <b>Adam J. Shires of redhorsedesign</b>. The single cover ""Triffids and Trees"" is complete and looks incredible. I simply cannot wait to show you all and see what Adam will do next for the album!<br/><br/><b>Filming</b> the first ever <b>Anne of the Wolves</b> video of our single <b>""Triffids and Trees.""</b> <br/><p><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>BUT ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE - PLEASE HELP ME PAY MY BAND!  <br/></b></h3>
<b></b><br/>With your help, I'd like to actually pay the people who have helped bring my songs to life.  My wonderful band, <b>THE WOLVES</b>.  Without them, <b>NONE</b> of this would have been possible. <br/><p></p>
<p>Please allow me to proudly introduce them to you.<br/><br/><b></b></p>
<h3><b>THE WOLVES: <br/>
</b></h3>
<br/><b>NATHANIEL POYNTER</b> - who plays clarinet like a god damn boss, tells a tall tale, and arranges an epic finale.  That's when he's not working overtime teaching the next generation to appreciate Miles Davis or playing an Irish ditty whilst insisting he's Italian.<br/><br/><b>HAYLEY JONES-BUCKLEY</b> - who rocks the double-bass, writes all the charts, runs the treasury and organizes festivals. When she's not teaching refugees English or planning her upcoming wedding...or basically being the coolest chick on the planet.<br/><b><br/>MATT GIBSON</b> - who thunders on percussion, runs technical support, records and edits rehearsals every week and also does our graphic design.  When he's not being a full time graphic designer or proposing to Hayley on top of a mountain. A MOUNTAIN. <br/><br/><b>STIRLING GILL-CHAMBERS </b>- who sweeps us away on violin, dresses incredibly dapper he puts us all to shame and wears his moustache so bloody well, he makes even women consider growing one. When he's not serving coffee, shaking his head at silly orders for coffee or reprimanding us on our choice of coffee.<br/><br/>These precious people give me their time and musical collaboration <b>FOR FREE</b> whilst also utilizing their other skills <b>FOR FREE</b>.  They have given so much of their energy and support to this project, writing their own parts to the songs I compose and then helping me arrange the overall product.  And they are all <b>professional musicians.  </b><i>(Can you imagine doing what you do everyday and not getting paid?!) </i><b><br/><br/></b>So, I would dearly love to reward them.  <br/><br/><p></p>

<h3>Anne of the Wolves </h3>
</div></div>","ANNE OF THE WOLVES
 (Have a listen to ""Blue and Black"" or other songs from my debut EP, ""Rainmaker."" )      Anne of the Wolves - Blue & Black
Hello! Do you have a minute?
Hello, thank you for visiting!  I'm Anne of the Wolves.  I'm a singer and songwriter from Melbourne, Australia and I'm hoping to get my album produced with a little help from my friends.  
As you can hear, I'm pretty lucky to already have an absolutely 
cracking band of musicians behind me and together we have created what we are calling melodramatic gypsy-folk 
jazz-noir, a sound that we adore playing together.  You can probably hear the fun we're having at the end of Blue & Black!  
I am so proud of my band and I couldn't be happier or more eager to share our creation with you!
In 
order to do that, though, I do need some help to fund the recording and production of 
our debut album and single - ""Triffids And Trees.""
If you have a few minutes, I'll explain a little bit more... 

The Crazy Truth Behind The Music 
Those of you who've already seen or heard an Anne of the Wolves performance know that the songs are pretty dark.  Even the happy or fun, loud stomping songs can have a real melancholy in the lyrics.This is because all my music comes from one big influence in my life:I have suffered anxiety and depression since I was 14 years old. For a long, LONG time, I had no idea why I felt the way I did.  I have been bullied a lot as a result and the piano has been my friend when I've felt I've had no one else.  
The song, ""Triffids & Trees"" has lyrics which embody exactly how I feel when the darkness takes me; 
""I'm running to the wind, pushing me back. I'm running to the wind, coloured in black. Listen....the fog.""Writing songs has always been my way of expressing the overwhelming sadness, livid black anger or intense illogical fear that can come without warning to anyone struggling with anxiety or living with depression.   And it seems I'm not alone!  Since coming out about my own troubles, it's become apparent that many of us are suffering from a mental 
health issue these days.  Perhaps this is why people seem to be 
connecting with Anne of the Wolves' music?  It's hard admitting there's something wrong, but thanks to my wonderful band, I do feel I've been able to finally bring myself out from among the triffids and into the trees, as it were, and this is what the album is all about.    
  The Album To Be!
 ""Triffids And Trees"", the album, is one big musical story of the many emotional paths traveled through these last few years of my struggle - a particularly rough time when a nearly decade long relationship was failing.  
The hopeful highs and absolute crushing lows, the trauma that I'm still battling to this day from being bullied and excluded by close 'friends'.  It's all there in this album.  I am very proud of it.  
And funnily enough, it's not all dark and depressing, given the subject matter!  Some of the songs are quite uplifting and downright fun!  The gypsy-honky-tonk number, ""Louisiana Swamp Stomp"" says to get moving and just be yourself and to hell with those who want to quash your spirit!
       ""Dance like you're going to die. We're all going to die!
    NO! You know you ain't going to die, doing the Louisiana Swamp Stomp!""
Or as my Gran would say, ""Buck up and don't let the bastards get you down!""  
I'm so excited about this album, I cannot wait for you to hear it!
You'll hear the full scale talent of my band as well, as it's their musicianship that adds that snarling, full-bodied, hot-blooded, wonderfully epic dynamic to Anne of the Wolves.  And as Anne of the Wolves keeps performing and the music keeps connecting with people, I am starting to realize that if something so beautiful can come out of something so dark like depression - then I can and WILL keep living with it!

And gladly! 
THE FUNDS

Of course, to help make this project a reality - I do need some help.  I self-funded the first EP, ""Rainmaker"" which was a rewarding experience of course but an album, single and video is a WAY bigger project and I simply can't do it alone! I would be so grateful if you could pledge even just a little to help me on my way.  There are so many perks you can get! You get something even if you pledge as little as $5!  And everything you donate will go towards the following:   Recording - with Tomas Strode (from PBS Live!) - This is complete! We had a dynamite weekend with Tom and recorded 9 songs over about one and a half days! Thank you, Tom! Mixing/ Production - with Myles Mumford (aka Mr Excellent).Mastering, printing and pressing of 1000 CD's for the album and 500 for the single (with possibly some vinyl if we go over our goal!)Artwork for the cover - designed by Adam J. Shires of redhorsedesign. The single cover ""Triffids and Trees"" is complete and looks incredible. I simply cannot wait to show you all and see what Adam will do next for the album!Filming the first ever Anne of the Wolves video of our single ""Triffids and Trees."" 

BUT ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE - PLEASE HELP ME PAY MY BAND!  
With your help, I'd like to actually pay the people who have helped bring my songs to life.  My wonderful band, THE WOLVES.  Without them, NONE of this would have been possible. 
Please allow me to proudly introduce them to you.
THE WOLVES: 

NATHANIEL POYNTER - who plays clarinet like a god damn boss, tells a tall tale, and arranges an epic finale.  That's when he's not working overtime teaching the next generation to appreciate Miles Davis or playing an Irish ditty whilst insisting he's Italian.HAYLEY JONES-BUCKLEY - who rocks the double-bass, writes all the charts, runs the treasury and organizes festivals. When she's not teaching refugees English or planning her upcoming wedding...or basically being the coolest chick on the planet.MATT GIBSON - who thunders on percussion, runs technical support, records and edits rehearsals every week and also does our graphic design.  When he's not being a full time graphic designer or proposing to Hayley on top of a mountain. A MOUNTAIN. STIRLING GILL-CHAMBERS - who sweeps us away on violin, dresses incredibly dapper he puts us all to shame and wears his moustache so bloody well, he makes even women consider growing one. When he's not serving coffee, shaking his head at silly orders for coffee or reprimanding us on our choice of coffee.These precious people give me their time and musical collaboration FOR FREE whilst also utilizing their other skills FOR FREE.  They have given so much of their energy and support to this project, writing their own parts to the songs I compose and then helping me arrange the overall product.  And they are all professional musicians.  (Can you imagine doing what you do everyday and not getting paid?!) So, I would dearly love to reward them.  
APPROXIMATE COSTS
Below is what I'd expect to pay for everything: Reward costs$250 - frames x 10 $250 - paper and post, printing, etc.
Printing and Pressing $1200 - single - only 500 being made!$1500 - album - 1000 being made.
Recording$800 - CompletedArtwork for Single$550 - CompletedArtwork for Album $550 
Mixing $1500

Mastering $1100Video Shooting and Editing$1000The Wolves - $500 ea = $2000
TOTAL = $10,650
 
If We Don't Make Our Goal
 Luckily we still get what's been donated, so rest assured that your funds will still be used to go toward the album, it may just take a little bit longer to get to you... I'd just probably need to figure out how I could fake my own death and use the insurance money?  I'll be sure to keep you all updated!    Other Ways You Can Help Please don't be worried if you can't contribute financially!  I would love it if you could even share the link to this campaign on your own social network or to whoever you think may be interested.  
If you have a skill you wish to donate to any aspects of the project so that the funds raised can be used elsewhere, that would be great! Are you a photographer, film-maker, framer, baker, candlestick-maker?
With your help, I would love to make this all come about! Thanks for all your support, I truly appreciate it!

the therapeutic inspirational effect of music and her own authentic story of
revelation, she will receive a personal message and a huge inspiration about

<p>The story of awakening a Woman
– Goddess will be told in the form of <b>magical sounds of music, exotic
instruments, archaic virtuoso voice, lights, therapeutic visual art, sensuous
dance, aromatherapy, and poetry</b>. It is a <b>multidimensional experiential
journey</b> together with gifted artists, creators who create exclusively
positive art that serves for the awakening of human potential rather than
consumeristic or destructive trends.                      <br/></p><b> <b>                         Let’s
awaken the genius within every Woman!</b> <br/>
<br/>
</b>Due to
prevailing rational mind, emotional exclusion experienced by every modern human
being, mass egoism and endless consumerism, we are faced with painful
consequences that remain to be solved: wars, fights over territories and
resources, excessive negative and manipulative information, the pathology of
daily family life. 

<br/><br/><p>Our response to the destruction, wars, and egoism of our times is the Amiya
Inspiration project mission: the harmonious art, knowledge and practices of
unique wisdom, awakening the highest human potential. </p>
<p>               <b>                              Women
change the world</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We believe that global changes begin with awakening the feminine nature
that is responsible for the vitality, beauty, cooperation, love and intuition.</p>
<p>We claim that Every Woman has unique natural female spiritual talents, the
unveiling and realization of which do not only bring the feeling of happiness
into her life but also peace, success, health and wisdom to her family and
people around her. The women who will awaken the genius, the quality of a Goddess, within themselves will
peacefully induce change in modern society in a light and promising, more
harmonious and wiser direction.  </p>

To show
this, we have created a song and video clip “The Goddess” where over 50 women
have starred – sisters, mothers, daughters, careerists, housewives, lovers,
businesswomen, muses, teachers, actresses, and many more... These women have
overcome their fears, a variety of challenges of life, and have turned towards belief
in themselves as women saying: every woman is a Goddess. I am the Goddess.

<p>As it is not possible to create the show for free, our

 cancer FOR FREE. With each live show, 2-5% of revenues will be 
forwarded to funds to support women.</p>

construction for the show, to remunerate hired producers, musicians and 
dancers, to create natural scents &amp; impression gifts for the audience, costumes and accessories, promotion of the live-shows and mission ""The Goddess"" itself, as the revenues received from ticket sales cannot cover all our
 costs and travel expenses. Our team of volunteers is ready to further 
provide their limitless investment of time and energy but we must buy a

Amiya Inspiration is a phenomenon, which creates
a positive world, revealing the genius of women and men. We uncover the essential parts of human life: harmonious
relationships, personal growth, sacred feminine, blissful sexuality, successful
and creative life by:
Music & Live Shows
Visual Arts
Web & Live Seminars
Social Actions & Happiness Campaigns
Books & Tantra Poetry 

This magic story is happening now. Amiya Inspiration team is creating experiential epic live show “The
Goddess” and intends to present it to as many people as possible around the
globe! “The Goddess” is a firework of unique knowledge, inspiration, and
positive energy, where every woman will hear her soul’s vocation, experience
the therapeutic inspirational effect of music and her own authentic story of
revelation, she will receive a personal message and a huge inspiration about
herself. This show provides an opportunity for every human to meet their divine
nature and to discover the power of femininity in a new spiritual way.               
The story of awakening a Woman
– Goddess will be told in the form of magical sounds of music, exotic
instruments, archaic virtuoso voice, lights, therapeutic visual art, sensuous
dance, aromatherapy, and poetry. It is a multidimensional experiential
journey together with gifted artists, creators who create exclusively
positive art that serves for the awakening of human potential rather than
consumeristic or destructive trends.                                                Let’s
awaken the genius within every Woman! 

Due to
prevailing rational mind, emotional exclusion experienced by every modern human
being, mass egoism and endless consumerism, we are faced with painful
consequences that remain to be solved: wars, fights over territories and
resources, excessive negative and manipulative information, the pathology of
daily family life. 

Our response to the destruction, wars, and egoism of our times is the Amiya
Inspiration project mission: the harmonious art, knowledge and practices of
unique wisdom, awakening the highest human potential. 
                                             Women
change the world


We believe that global changes begin with awakening the feminine nature
that is responsible for the vitality, beauty, cooperation, love and intuition.
We claim that Every Woman has unique natural female spiritual talents, the
unveiling and realization of which do not only bring the feeling of happiness
into her life but also peace, success, health and wisdom to her family and
people around her. The women who will awaken the genius, the quality of a Goddess, within themselves will
peacefully induce change in modern society in a light and promising, more
harmonious and wiser direction.  

To show
this, we have created a song and video clip “The Goddess” where over 50 women
have starred – sisters, mothers, daughters, careerists, housewives, lovers,
businesswomen, muses, teachers, actresses, and many more... These women have
overcome their fears, a variety of challenges of life, and have turned towards belief
in themselves as women saying: every woman is a Goddess. I am the Goddess.
You are the Goddess! Watch it:                  International
team of artists and producers bands together for this                                                       Mission  ""The
Goddess""!


We are a team of dedicated professionals: producers, designers, organizers,
programmers, and communication specialists: fully devoted volunteers committed
to the idea. We have been working on the realization of this mission for more
than a year and believe the project is what the people truly need here and now.
If you dream of a better world, join our idea too. Your participation is
crucial!   
                                                                    Our vision of the world is also Your future!

Financial support is very important to finalize the 
project and make it reach the people of the world sooner. We are not 
profit-oriented. Our project is more of a social action, it's a 
beautiful message about the divine human potential that we want to share
 with everyone!
As it is not possible to create the show for free, our 
concerts will be priced; however, we make ticket prices as low as 
possible so that our events could be attended by thousands of people 
regardless of their income. To each concert we will be inviting many 
disadvantaged people, people with disabilities, and women suffering from
 cancer FOR FREE. With each live show, 2-5% of revenues will be 
forwarded to funds to support women.
Your financial help will be used to acquire video 
projections, art images, sound and lighting solutions, to build stage 
construction for the show, to remunerate hired producers, musicians and 
dancers, to create natural scents & impression gifts for the audience, costumes and accessories, promotion of the live-shows and mission ""The Goddess"" itself, as the revenues received from ticket sales cannot cover all our
 costs and travel expenses. Our team of volunteers is ready to further 
provide their limitless investment of time and energy but we must buy a 
lot of advertising and social media services to make our message reach 
YOU and other people. That is why we have created the Indiegogo project 
on crowd funding basis. It is a great joy to have you read this message!
 It means you already know about our mission. Please join it. You are 
needed!
We are asking for 102.000 USD to create the live show ""The Goddess"" and to support the first 7 live shows.  The more amount is exceeded,  the more people will sooner see our live show in their towns around the World!!!                                *Travel expenses, venue rents, filming, and the remaining part of 
artists  remunerations will be covered from ticket sales income.              Any contribution of yours is a great help and
inspiration for us! 
To THANK YOU for your contribution we have created inspirational perks with beautiful intentions and care - we designed all
 the offered gifts of gratitude with great love and personal touch just 
for you, and your loved ones. These gifts are not simply objects. Choose a gift and it will become a source for your positive change and joy.
Even in case the full amount is not raised, the Amiya 
Inspiration team will continue its mission! The best gift is knowing 
that you are involved in reading this text, which means the project is 
sure to happen! :)                                          Support and receive a positive present!                                                              THANK YOU!!!!",12.0,1,"1 Campaign

</h3>I have been singing since I could talk and writing songs and poetry for the past 20 years. Until recently, I have kept my music to myself and it is now time for me to begin to share my music with the world. It's taken me longer than I thought to get to where I am, but the
experiences I've been through have truly shaped who I have become. Every
song is a piece of my life. Writing from a place of honesty is difficult but
that's what makes it exciting and interesting. The songs on this album are
the best songs I've written (so far) and I want them to be heard by old and new
fans alike. <br/><p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What You're Supporting<br/>
</h3> This campaign is raising funds for my first professionally recorded album with Billy Gewin, an Atlanta-based producer and engineer. Together, Billy and I are digging into my original material, writing arrangements, and reaching out to local musicians to bring the songs to life. <br/><br/>I have been able to cover the costs of recording and producing almost half of the songs we plan to have on the album. The costs included in making a record can be daunting - from studio rental,
mixing, mastering, printing, and of course paying the wonderful
musicians.  I am trying to reach a goal of $5,000 on Indiegogo to help
with the all of the costs.  If the
universe allows and we raise over $5,000, I will be able to send out my album
to independent labels and managers, publishing companies, as well as radio
stations across the nation. This is only the beginning for me and if we raise
over the marked amount it could mean that my dreams are finally
becoming my reality and <b>you believe in me</b>.  </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>If you are ready to make a contribution, you can just click the big pink ""Contribute Now"" button on the top right of this page! Every little bit counts and I am incredibly grateful for the support. <br/><br/>If you have friends in your network that would be interested in supporting local art and music here in Atlanta, then let's get the work out and make some noise!

<br/>Dearest fans, friends and family,<br/><br/>We are VESPERIA! We are an epic death/ black metal band from Toronto, Canada and we have recently returned home from Wacken Open Air - where we were awarded the title of International Wacken Metal Battle World Champions! <b>Our music weaves a tale of bygone heroism, the majestic beauty of our native Canada and of the great cold embrace. </b>We will continue this narrative as we enter the studio this Spring to record our forthcoming album - and followup to last year's The Iron Tempests EP!<br/><br/><b>To hear our previous works, including The Iron Tempests EP - click <a href=""http://vesperia.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE!</a><br/></b><br/><b>OUR CAMPAIGN: </b>In March, we will be entering the prestigious Blue Sound &amp; Music Studios to work with engineer Russ Mackay (whose previous clients include <b>Iron Maiden, Mastodon, Styx</b> &amp; more) to record our next full-length album! Afterward, we will be embarking on the biggest tour the band has ever taken part of as direct support across Canada for Finland's KALMAH! In order to raise the money needed for these adventures, we booked a 3 and a half week tour across the North American Eastern Seaboard, as well as the US Midwest . Unfortunately, <b>we never received our work permits from US immigration and were forced to cancel the bulk of our tour</b>. We went on to tour JUST eastern Canada as a result, returning home with more debt than when we left. However, we won't let this stop us from realizing our dreams and taking the next biggest step of our careers!<br/><br/>If our Indiegogo campaign is successful, <b>made possible by the people we love and revere the most - YOU - </b> we will be able to successfully fund the recording process of our next album, get back on the road and continue our quest of spreading our brand of epic metal! By contributing to this campaign, you will support us 100% without any help from any label and allow us to play for newer, larger audiences across the continent and the rest of the Earth!<br/><br/><b>By purchasing a digital or physical copy of our new album in advance, you will be the direct reason we will be able to chart in Canada and other countries around the world!</b><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451280325/guzucg2zvpzgzfjqp1kh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><b>WHY VESPERIA NEEDS YOUR HELP: </b>Recording and touring is VERY expensive - and we are constantly under threat of losing money; whether it be from cancelled tours, or costly van repairs. The only way a modern metal band can get by these days is by proving their talents and ambitions to the world and build a larger fanbase through touring and releasing new material. Last year we were extremely fortunate to compete in the international Wacken Battle at Wacken Open Air in Germany, where to our surprise - we won! We came home with a lot of prizes and a nice chunk of prize money - <b>which went directly into settling a huge merch invoice and our US work permit applications.</b> <br/><br/>When we had to cancel our US tour in November, we lost A LOT of money. You can read about that <a href=""http://bravewords.com/news/vesperia-cancel-us-tour-due-to-visa-issues-announce-new-canadian-dates"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>HERE</b></a>. Additionally,  we are still paying for the costly repairs on our van that we had before our last tour of Canada. Sure, we could absolutely record this album ourselves, but we really want to give you all the best product we can possibly create, and that only means working with the best at one of the nicest studios in our area.<br/><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451626523/oeukvxuclgvyv5zuehdt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>To get ourselves back on track and to afford recording our new album, we have created some of - what we believe to be - the most unique and special perks and experiences that will <b>ONLY be available through this crowdfunding campaign</b>.<br/><br/><b>WHERE YOUR CONTRIBUTION GOES: </b>100% of the funds raised from this campaign will be used <b>to record our next full-length album</b>. If we reach 100% of our goal, it will cover all of the the tracking, mixing and mastering costs associated with the creation of this beast-of-an-album-to-be. No matter what percentage of our goal we eventually achieve, we will accept each contribution with equal appreciation and gratitude. When we were putting the perks together for this campaign, we realized we really needed to make it special for all of you - because you have all been so incredibly supportive. We needed to create perks that were exciting for you existing fans and for our fans-to-be! <br/><br/><b>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES: </b>We understand the risks and hardships that await us in the future. This career path of ours is fraught with trials that are only too well known to both like-minded musicians and music fans. To say we haven't had our share of tough times on this path would be a lie. There are always difficult hurdles to overcome popping up on an almost-daily basis. BUT, we have also enjoyed a large amount of success as a result of taking on these risks. Risk is the key to success, as they say.<br/><br/>We feel like we have made massive leaps in the last year of our careers, having toured from coast to coast numerous times, travelling and playing at prestigious gatherings like Wacken Open Air, having airplay and reviews coming in from around the world and having opportunities arise in our future only strengthen and establish our hunger to create, to tour and to play music. We are all in our mid-twenties, so we have so many years ahead of us as we foster Vesperia into blooming even further. To date we have endured the joys and hardships of being lost, looted, stranded, ripped off, praised,  rejected, supported all while imagining the tens of thousands of hours, dollars, kilometers we have clocked being a touring and recording band. We understand that we may not reach our goal set - as that is a massive amount of money to raise - but that will only be another challenge that we look forward to facing with fervour. <br/><br/><b>OTHER WAYS TO HELP: </b>We understand that not all of your will have the means to contribute to our campaign, but would like to help us on this new adventure. We hugely encourage everyone to share this campaign to your friends and family or to someone you know who you think would be interested in what we do! There are some fancy share tools available on this page to help spread the word about us and make some noise about this campaign; we would be duly grateful if you used them to help us on this long, dark and labourous road!<br/><br/>Thank you so much for your love and support, everyone!<br/>-VESPERIA<br/><br/>(Morgan, Casey, Frankie, Dylan)</div>","Dearest fans, friends and family,We are VESPERIA!

We went on to tour JUST eastern Canada as a result, returning home with more debt than when we left. However, we won't let this stop us from realizing our dreams and taking the next biggest step of our careers!If our Indiegogo campaign is successful, made possible by the people we love and revere the most - YOU -  we will be able to successfully fund the recording process of our next album, get back on the road and continue our quest of spreading our brand of epic metal! By contributing to this campaign, you will support us 100% without any help from any label and allow us to play for newer, larger audiences across the continent and the rest of the Earth!By purchasing a digital or physical copy of our new album in advance, you will be the direct reason we will be able to chart in Canada and other countries around the world!
WHY VESPERIA NEEDS YOUR HELP: Recording and touring is VERY expensive - and we are constantly under threat of losing money; whether it be from cancelled tours, or costly van repairs. The only way a modern metal band can get by these days is by proving their talents and ambitions to the world and build a larger fanbase through touring and releasing new material. Last year we were extremely fortunate to compete in the international Wacken Battle at Wacken Open Air in Germany, where to our surprise - we won! We came home with a lot of prizes and a nice chunk of prize money - which went directly into settling a huge merch invoice and our US work permit applications. When we had to cancel our US tour in November, we lost A LOT of money. You can read about that HERE. Additionally,  we are still paying for the costly repairs on our van that we had before our last tour of Canada. Sure, we could absolutely record this album ourselves, but we really want to give you all the best product we can possibly create, and that only means working with the best at one of the nicest studios in our area.To get ourselves back on track and to afford recording our new album, we have created some of - what we believe to be - the most unique and special perks and experiences that will ONLY be available through this crowdfunding campaign.WHERE YOUR CONTRIBUTION GOES: 100% of the funds raised from this campaign will be used to record our next full-length album. If we reach 100% of our goal, it will cover all of the the tracking, mixing and mastering costs associated with the creation of this beast-of-an-album-to-be. No matter what percentage of our goal we eventually achieve, we will accept each contribution with equal appreciation and gratitude. When we were putting the perks together for this campaign, we realized we really needed to make it special for all of you - because you have all been so incredibly supportive. We needed to create perks that were exciting for you existing fans and for our fans-to-be! RISKS & CHALLENGES: We understand the risks and hardships that await us in the future. This career path of ours is fraught with trials that are only too well known to both like-minded musicians and music fans. To say we haven't had our share of tough times on this path would be a lie. There are always difficult hurdles to overcome popping up on an almost-daily basis. BUT, we have also enjoyed a large amount of success as a result of taking on these risks. Risk is the key to success, as they say.We feel like we have made massive leaps in the last year of our careers, having toured from coast to coast numerous times, travelling and playing at prestigious gatherings like Wacken Open Air, having airplay and reviews coming in from around the world and having opportunities arise in our future only strengthen and establish our hunger to create, to tour and to play music. We are all in our mid-twenties, so we have so many years ahead of us as we foster Vesperia into blooming even further. To date we have endured the joys and hardships of being lost, looted, stranded, ripped off, praised,  rejected, supported all while imagining the tens of thousands of hours, dollars, kilometers we have clocked being a touring and recording band. We understand that we may not reach our goal set - as that is a massive amount of money to raise - but that will only be another challenge that we look forward to facing with fervour. OTHER WAYS TO HELP: We understand that not all of your will have the means to contribute to our campaign, but would like to help us on this new adventure. We hugely encourage everyone to share this campaign to your friends and family or to someone you know who you think would be interested in what we do! There are some fancy share tools available on this page to help spread the word about us and make some noise about this campaign; we would be duly grateful if you used them to help us on this long, dark and labourous road!Thank you so much for your love and support, everyone!-VESPERIA(Morgan, Casey, Frankie, Dylan)",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Интро

Привет! Меня зовут Данил, и Gravity Rain - это мой музыкальный проект.



Я занимаюсь музыкой вот уже довольно долгое время, и близкие мне люди могут Вам сказать с определённостью и точностью, что музыка была, есть и будет для меня всем. Всю свою жизнь я занимался музыкой исключительно из-за любви к ней, не пытаясь добиться ничего серьёзного с позиции музыкальной индустрии, вроде записи полноценного альбома, съёмки клипа или подписи контракта с крупным лейблом.

Однако после создания мной проекта Gravity Rain в мае 2014 года ситуация немного изменилась. Gravity Rain создавался мной как melodic/prog/atmospheric metal проект с чистым вокалом и некоторым скандинавским привкусом. За это время я выпустил EP под названием ""The Shining Silence"", которым горжусь, и который, к счастью для меня, был тепло принят публикой и прессой, к примеру ревью - http://www.soundscapemagazine.com/gravityraintheshiningsilence/

Вы можете бесплатно послушать и скачать EP здесь

Но сейчас я очень хочу сделать нечто по-настоящему серьёзное - большой и красивый полноформатник, который смог бы подытожить 12 лет моей музыкальной деятельности, а также, европейское турне в поддержку этой пластинки.

""Artifacts of Balance""Так называется мой новый альбом. Я думаю, что он так называется, потому что музыка на нём балансирует между моей старой музыкальной концепцией и новой. Я считаю важным сделать так, чтобы люди услышали эту музыку. Её даже сложно назвать металом, поскольку я стараюсь предложить миру нечто новое, нечто свежо звучащее, а главное - нечто, что прочувствуется иначе, чем просто метал. Однако как сказал Guthrie Govan: ""Разговаривать о музыке - это как танцевать об архитектуре"". Поэтому, лучше Вам послушать это самим.


Дизайн обложки нового альбома

У меня даже подготовлен полноценный трек-лист с нового альбома (все песни будут новые):
1) Temple of Haste2) Dive3) Gist4) Join5) Ikameshii (Jotun's Rage)6) Closer7) Let It Hurt8) M.A.D.9) Chaeon10) Sunfire

Запись завершена на 95%, однако моих средств оказалось недостаточно для сведения, мастеринга, печати дисков и турне. Вот на этом этапе я и хотел бы попросить Вашей помощи, друзья. 
Итак, сведение и мастеринг в совокупе стоят $3500, печать дисков - ещё $1000. Остаётся европейское турне, которое стоит в среднем $5000. Сбор средств на турне начнётся автоматически здесь же в случае успеха сбора средств на альбом.
Турне
Этот тур в поддержку нового альбома - реально критически важная вещь для Gravity Rain, поскольку без достаточного финансирования практически нереально устроить турне, особенно европейское, для неизвестной инди команды из России.
Турне - очень серьёзная штука, и помимо очень грустного факта о том, что выйти на контакт с букинговым агентством оказалось дико сложной задачей, тур включает в себя следующие расходы: логистика, проживание, питание, оплата аренды площадок, на которых мы будем играть, а также оплата труда музыкантов, играющих со мной. Однако, не смотря на всё это, турне - это всё-таки реальная возможность для Вас увидеть и услышать нас живьём!



Поэтому очень важно не останавливаться если мы достигнем цели финансирования альбома! Давайте добьём до тура!
Чем мы порадуем Вас?
Я думаю, Вы останетесь довольны перками и плюшками, которые я для Вас приготовил! Альбом в цифре, диски с автографом, бонус треки и прочий эксклюзив. Ну неужели не прелесть - персональный концерт или, например, мы играем концерт в реальном времени, а Вы у компьютера кофеёк попиваете?
Мне очень не хотелось бы допускать мысль о том, что эта кампания может провалиться, однако если это случится, я Вам гарантирую - я найду способ завершить альбом, даю Вам слово.

Иные способы
Если по какой-либо причине Вы не можете поддержать мою кампанию деньгами, никаких проблем! Рассказывайте о ней друзьям, репостите и так далее. Такого рода помощь очень сложно переоценить, спасибо Вам за это огромное!
Итоги
Обещаю держать Вас в курсе событий по альбому!

I moved to Nashville one year ago, and  have worked extremely hard this past year, soul searching, writing and finding my voice as an artist. I have wanted to pursue music for as long as I can remember, so after graduating from the University of Wyoming, I moved to Los Angeles to follow my dreams. I recorded a few EP's in Los Angeles, but had no idea what I was doing, who I was as an artist, or how to get the music to the public in an effective way. I was pursing country music  because that is what I thought I should do, and what others thought I should do, etc..After being in Nashville this past year, and leaving the comforts of my friends and family, I had no choice but to get to know myself on a deeper level. This year has been tough, with many up and downs, but I am so excited to have finally found my voice, and to have written songs that actually mean something to me, not just songs I think could make it big on the radio or that others want to hear..It feels great!!! This new album ""HOME"" is my story and I am so excited to share it with you. </p>
<h2>How you can help: </h2>
</div><div> <p>Creating music doesn't come cheap, and as much as I hate asking for help, I am at the point in my life where I can no longer do it alone. I have put everything I have into this project, but could really use your help to finish it!! </p>
<p><b>Here is a breakdown of where the donations will be going</b>:</p>
<p>1. In order to compensate my amazing producer Dewey Boyd for his dedication to my vision and his time away from his family: Production/Mixing/Editing/ Studio Time: $5000</p>
<p>2.The super talented hand picked musicians we hired to bring these songs to life: $2,250</p>

</div></div>","Mission For the first time in my life, I finally feel like I am exactly where I am supposed to be. I moved to Nashville one year ago, and  have worked extremely hard this past year, soul searching, writing and finding my voice as an artist. I have wanted to pursue music for as long as I can remember, so after graduating from the University of Wyoming, I moved to Los Angeles to follow my dreams. I recorded a few EP's in Los Angeles, but had no idea what I was doing, who I was as an artist, or how to get the music to the public in an effective way. I was pursing country music  because that is what I thought I should do, and what others thought I should do, etc..After being in Nashville this past year, and leaving the comforts of my friends and family, I had no choice but to get to know myself on a deeper level. This year has been tough, with many up and downs, but I am so excited to have finally found my voice, and to have written songs that actually mean something to me, not just songs I think could make it big on the radio or that others want to hear..It feels great!!! This new album ""HOME"" is my story and I am so excited to share it with you. 
How you can help: 
 Creating music doesn't come cheap, and as much as I hate asking for help, I am at the point in my life where I can no longer do it alone. I have put everything I have into this project, but could really use your help to finish it!! 
Here is a breakdown of where the donations will be going:
1. In order to compensate my amazing producer Dewey Boyd for his dedication to my vision and his time away from his family: Production/Mixing/Editing/ Studio Time: $5000
2.The super talented hand picked musicians we hired to bring these songs to life: $2,250

<h2><b>DULUTH DOES DYLAN: An Overview</b></h2>
<p>Every five years since 2001, musicians in and around the burgeoning cultural scene of Duluth, Minnesota, have released a compilation album of cover songs by their city's most famous son: Bob Dylan, who was born Robert Zimmerman in Duluth's St. Luke's Hospital in 1941, and lived in the town for his first six years before moving an hour north to Hibbing, Minnesota.   <a href=""http://www.duluthdoesdylan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.duluthdoesdylan.com</a></p>
<h3><b>The Project</b></h3>
<p>We've enrolled the musicians ~ over 15 bands and over 50+ talented combined artists from around Duluth, Minnesota and have begun recording what will become the 4th CD in the series.  Recording is happening now at Sacred Heart Recording Studio and will be released in May of 2016 to commemorate the 75th birthday of Bob Dylan ~ including plans for a special CD release show in Duluth &amp; Minneapolis.</p>

<p></p>
<h3><b>The Influence</b></h3>
<p>Like F. Scott Fitzgerald's fictional Jay Gatsby, Dylan has a famously conflicted relationship with ""the north country"" - changing his name and creating alternate biographies to mask his origins, and rarely discussing his personal history. Yet Dylan has referenced the area - often elliptically, of course, and subject to interpretation - in songs including Highway 61 Revisited (which abuts Duluth), Desolation Row, Walls of Red Wing, Girl from the North Country, North Country Blues, and most directly Something There Is About You, among other songs. Residents of the area also enjoy recognizing features of his famously unique accent as characteristically Minnesotan.</p>
<p>This fractured relationship, however, only creates a more interesting dynamic between Duluth musicians and Dylan. Like previous ""Duluth Does Dylan"" albums, this album is not offered as a simple homage or touristy trinket. Instead, One More Cup of Duluth Does Dylan presents a complex response by musicians who cannot help but have something to say about the work of their city's most famous son, and occasionally to rework one of his songs.</p>
<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>Like the first 3 successful compilation CD's, it's a special relationship that exists in the old port town of Duluth in the core of it's music and the hearts of it's musicians.  Bob Dylan's music and his stories through the voices, eyes and their interpretations. </p>

<p>Since the release of the initial compilation project, Duluth Does Dylan, released in 2001, the city of Duluth has further embraced Bob Dylan.  The city has installed named a downtown street after him ""Bob Dylan Way"" and installed comemorative manhole covers and a group of area business owners and Dylan advocates formed a nonprofit organization and produces a Duluth Dylan Days week long festival including film, music and a unique ""Blood On The Tracks Express"" ~ a musical train ride up the scenic North  Shore of Minnesota to Hibbing, MN and back featuring local music throughout the ride.</p>

<p>This will be the fourth compilation CD in the series which was initially released in 2001.  The first three projects were all self funded and involved only Tim &amp; Tom.  We've decided we need help on this one as we plan for this to be the most successful of the four and are very pleased to have Brad, Dan &amp; William on board.</p>
<p>Certainly the most important team members on this project are the bands!  Without them and their participation none of this would be possible!</p>

<h1><b>Why We Need Your Help.</b></h1>
<p>The endeavor of making a record, let alone the complexity of scheduling and the financial investment is great as you can see. Funding will be used to pay for studio time to record, mix and master the project along with artwork, graphic design, licensing, replication, IndieGoGo fee's, fulfillment and marketing.</p>
<h3><b>Where the Money Goes: $13,000.00</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Recording, Mix, Master - $4,500</li>
<li>Produce - $300</li>
<li>Art and Layout- $1,000</li>
<li>CD Duplication - $1,750</li>
<li>Licensing - $1,800</li>
<li>IndieGo-Go Fee - $650</li>
<li>Musician Stipend - $3,000</li>
</ul>
<p>We are taking careful approach with baby-steps and thus have set up several levels of funding with the first level described above and are hopeful to reach beyond to the following stretch goals.  Should we reach the first goal, we would love to afford to pay our mix engineer, all of the musicians that have contributed, photographer, videographer and launch a marketing and distribution plan:</p>
<h3><b>STRETCH GOAL 1 : $13,000</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Mixing, Master - $4,500</li>
<li>Produce - $250</li>
<li>Video and Edit - $1,000</li>
<li>Photographer - $600</li>
<li>Promotion &amp; Distribution - $3,000</li>
<li>IndieGoGo Crowd Sourcing Fee - $650</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Musician Stipend - $3,000</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Should we make the first two goals we have good people waiting patiently in the wings who we would also like to pay for all of their staff time and have plans to release a short documentary film on Duluth, Minnesota and the Dylan project.</span>
</div><div>
<h3><b>STRETCH GOAL 2 : $10,000</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Efforts Compensation and Band Bonus - $6,000</li>
<li>Short Film About the Project and Duluth Music - $4,000</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</b></h3>
<p>Thus far the difficulty of making this all happen is organizing the musicians with their busy schedules, selecting the songs, scheduling recording times and communicating our team and friends for the Duluth Does Dylan recording project.</p>
<h3><b>PROMOTION: Other Ways You Can Help</b></h3>

""Tucked into a hillside on the tip of Lake Superior, this rugged and industrial port city harbors a restless, eclectic and creative music scene.""  ""It's a vibe that's as palpable as it is difficult to define."" 
                                                       ~ Brad Nelson, Ripsaw News
Since the release of the initial compilation project, Duluth Does Dylan, released in 2001, the city of Duluth has further embraced Bob Dylan.  The city has installed named a downtown street after him ""Bob Dylan Way"" and installed comemorative manhole covers and a group of area business owners and Dylan advocates formed a nonprofit organization and produces a Duluth Dylan Days week long festival including film, music and a unique ""Blood On The Tracks Express"" ~ a musical train ride up the scenic North  Shore of Minnesota to Hibbing, MN and back featuring local music throughout the ride.

Sacred Heart Recording Studio
The project is recorded at the historic Sacred Heart Cathedral and recording 
studio.  



Cathedral

Sacred Heart towers over Duluth's Central Hillside neighborhood and overlooks  Lake Superior.  Sacred Heart, built in 1894 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, complete with arched plaster ceilings, wood floors, stained glass windows and unmatched acoustics is an outstanding setting to capture the energy of Twin Ports music.

Making It All Happen
The group of Duluth music enthusiasts consists of Tom Fabjance, Tim and Brad Nelson.  Tom and Tim produced the first Duluth Does Dylan compilation in 2001, producing a new compilation DDD cd every five years.

Tom produces and mixes with Tim Nelson, while handling the recording and mixing.  Brad Nelson, a founder of the Duluth Dylan Festival and a marketing professional, helps get the word out. Project initiator Tim Nelson works as Producer with Fabjance who manages the overall wrangler of all!

Tim, Brad and Tom have all been involved with the music scene in Duluth for 20+ years!  Both Tim & Brad are Duluth area musicians and have been involved in many events, festivals, music-zines, nightclubs and recording projects.  Tom Fabjance, a Chicago transplant, is a music producer and engineer that has also been involved in the Duluth music scene for many years.

Other folks helping us make this all possible are Dan Dresser & William Hurst.  Dan is our videographer on the project with plans of releasing a 20-minute short film documenting the project and it's artists.  William Hurst has been brought on board as our official project photographer!
This will be the fourth compilation CD in the series which was initially released in 2001.  The first three projects were all self funded and involved only Tim & Tom.  We've decided we need help on this one as we plan for this to be the most successful of the four and are very pleased to have Brad, Dan & William on board.
Certainly the most important team members on this project are the bands!  Without them and their participation none of this would be possible!

Why We Need Your Help.
The endeavor of making a record, let alone the complexity of scheduling and the financial investment is great as you can see. Funding will be used to pay for studio time to record, mix and master the project along with artwork, graphic design, licensing, replication, IndieGoGo fee's, fulfillment and marketing.
Where the Money Goes: $13,000.00

Recording, Mix, Master - $4,500
Produce - $300
Art and Layout- $1,000
CD Duplication - $1,750
Licensing - $1,800
IndieGo-Go Fee - $650
Musician Stipend - $3,000

We are taking careful approach with baby-steps and thus have set up several levels of funding with the first level described above and are hopeful to reach beyond to the following stretch goals.  Should we reach the first goal, we would love to afford to pay our mix engineer, all of the musicians that have contributed, photographer, videographer and launch a marketing and distribution plan:
STRETCH GOAL 1 : $13,000

Mixing, Master - $4,500
Produce - $250
Video and Edit - $1,000
Photographer - $600
Promotion & Distribution - $3,000
IndieGoGo Crowd Sourcing Fee - $650
Musician Stipend - $3,000

Should we make the first two goals we have good people waiting patiently in the wings who we would also like to pay for all of their staff time and have plans to release a short documentary film on Duluth, Minnesota and the Dylan project.

STRETCH GOAL 2 : $10,000

Efforts Compensation and Band Bonus - $6,000
Short Film About the Project and Duluth Music - $4,000



RISKS & CHALLENGES
Thus far the difficulty of making this all happen is organizing the musicians with their busy schedules, selecting the songs, scheduling recording times and communicating our team and friends for the Duluth Does Dylan recording project.

</h3> <p>Welcome to our IndieGoGo campaign! KlezFactor is getting ready to produce its third CD, Europa. </p>
<p>KlezFactor was founded by Mike Anklewicz in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2004 and recorded The Golem of Bathurst Manor in 2005 and Klezmachine in 2008. While we've been fairly quiet on the recording front since then, we've definitely played all over the place!</p>
<p>In 2009, we did a three-city tour in the US, hitting Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia and we played the Montreal International Jazz Festival in 2010, followed by the Junction Arts Festival (Toronto) that fall. <br/></p>
<p>In late-2011, Mike went to Germany and founded a German version of KlezFactor, playing in several gigs in Berlin and Bayreuth. This version of the band spurred Mike to some more creativity and he's been working on composing new music for the KlezFactor project all while finishing his PhD in Ethnomusicology at York University in Toronto. With the degree finished, Dr. Mike is ready to usher in a new era of KlezFactor with a European tour and the recording of a new album.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Band</h3>
<p>Mike Anklewicz is the bandleader, composer, saxophonist and clarinetist. He is joined by Alex Bayer (bass), Florian von Frieling (guitar), Finlay Panter (drums) and Daniel Weltlinger (violin). </p>
<p>Mike hails from Toronto, Canada and has performed and studied klezmer since 1998. He's studying with some of the best in the world at this Eastern-European genre and has taught, performed and recorded all over Canada, the US and Europe.<br/></p>
<p>Alex is from Germany and is the founder of Pentelho, a world music fusion band in Berlin with Balkan and Latin influences.</p>
<p>Florian also comes from Germany (after studying in the Netherlands) and is a fantastic guitarist who has his own trio and plays in a huge variety of bands ranging from pop to swing.</p>
<p>Fin, from Liverpool, England, is a progressive drummer with one foot in traditional music and one foot in the experimental/improvisational realm.</p>
<p>Daniel has recently made Berlin his home, coming from Sydney, Australia and plays gypsy swing with Lulo Reinhardt and Daniel recently released his CD ""Koblenz."" <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We already have time booked as a band in Berlin this summer. What we need is the money to rehearse, record, mix, master and produce the new album!</p>
<p>We're looking for $7100 Canadian to fund all this! You might ask ""why so little?"" Well, things are a little cheaper over in Berlin and we're planning on letting our musicianship do the talking, getting as much as we can for the recording in our live concerts rather than spending days upon days in a recording studio.</p>
<p>We are NOT looking for funding for our tour! Those expenses are already taken care of. <br/></p>
<p>All of the funds raised in this campaign will go directly to the recording. If we don't reach our entire goal, we'll still make the recording! While we're expecting to be able to pay our musicians at least something for their hard work, this fee is probably the first to go since all of our other expenses for the recording are pretty fixed. </p>
<br/>
<p>We need: <br/></p>
<p>$1550 CDN - Recording Costs (1100 Euros)<br/>$1000 CDN - Mixing<br/>$500-1000 CDN- Mastering<br/>$1000 CDN - Duplication<br/>$700 CDN - Art/Design<br/>$1700 CDN - Musician Fees<br/></p>

</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>KlezFactor has been making their own brand of klezmer-fusion for the last 10 years. Bandleader Mike Anklewicz completed a PhD in ethnomusicology studying how klezmer music has always been blending its own sounds with those of other cultures. While it's important to keep ""traditional"" klezmer alive, KlezFactor is part of a long tradition that saw klezmer as one part of a cosmopolitan musical landscape. <br/><br/>The unique sounds of KlezFactor have been heard far beyond the places the band has performed. Through radio, internet and even TV, KlezFactor's music has been heard around the world. <br/><br/>We're proud to have had our music used to underscore the bio video of Montreal-born author Mordecai Richler, with narration by Christopher Plummer, for his induction into <a href=""http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/2011/mordecai-richler/video-0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Canada's Walk of Fame in 2011</a>. By helping us produce more original klezmer-fusion, we feel that we can continue to bring relevant music that reflects the Canadian Jewish experience to the wider world. <br/>

I’ll be able to buy studio time, hire sound engineers and producers,  pay musicians, get album artwork/stickers/T-Shirts designed and have the CD's duplicated, packaged and ready to spread to the masses. All of this will cost me an estimated $7,500. I have some awesome perks lined up for different levels of contributions to the campaign, so please check those out, contribute if you can, share with friends and help me spread some ""Southern Love!"" Cheers",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><b>SHORT STORY (voor Nederlands: zie onder)<br/><br/></b><p>&gt; New York based top producer<b> Bryce Goggin</b> (Antony &amp; the Johnsons, Pavement, Joan As Police Woman) invited us to record our <b>first EP. <br/></b>&gt; We are C.

Van den Hende, BIC: GKCCBEBB.</i> <i>Mention ""crowdfunding"" + ""name perk"" + ""your emailadres!!""</i><br/></p><p><b>HOW THE STORY STARTED</b></p>
<p>We teamed
up as songwriters/musicians in 2014, aiming to write a bunch of <b>killer pop
songs</b>, so we could sell those songs to Rihanna and spend the royalties  by drinking cocktails on a sunny island forever
lasting. No kidding, that was the plan…</p>
<p>Unfortunately
<b>we kinda liked our babies too much</b>,  especially
“If Courtney Love (Has Found The Plane)”, inspired by how Courtney Love claimed
to have found the missing Malaysian plane. The song is also the reason for our band name <b>C. Love Detectives</b>. </p>
<p>By
accident, this song was also broadcasted on our favorite Belgian radio station
Studio Brussels. <b>No way back</b>. Exit Rihanna dreams. Enter world domination, our
own private jets and you flying co-pilote to the Grammy’s with us. We can
dream, right? </p>
<p><b>HOW THE STORY FLIPPED</b></p>
<p>After one
of our exhausting writing sessions we laid down on the carpet, listening to our
favourite music. When “The Deep Field” by Joan As Policewoman came along, we
agreed that the sound of that album was so damn good. Tired, slightly drunk and
for that reason also <b>extremely fearless</b>, we emailed the <b>producer</b> of that album,
saying ""we wanted him"" and ""we wanted him to want us too"" (those words exactly…). </p>
<p>One hour
later he got back to us, saying <b>he liked what he heard</b>, asking us if we would
be interested to <b>come to New York</b> to record in his studio.</p>
<p>Enter <b>Bryce
Goggin</b> (Antony &amp; the Johnsons, Pavement, Joan As Policewoman) in the <b>C.
Love Detectives</b> story.</p>
<p><b>WHERE STORY IS GOING TO</b></p>
<p>We wrote
the songs. We got the producer. So here’s the plan…</p>
<p>We’re
heading to <b>NYC</b> in <b>June</b>, recording our first EP with Bryce Goggin.</p>
<p><b>Release</b>
planned in <b>September</b>, followed by some <b>showcases</b> and <b>club concerts</b>. </p>
<p>Big goal is
playing the <b>festivals</b> of <b>summer 2016</b>. It’s a long shot, but we’re confident this
is the right order of steps.</p>
<p><b>WHY WE NEED YOU</b></p>
<p>We live in
Belgium (Divan) and The Netherlands (M.), so New York is quite a journey for
us. </p>
<p>If you can
help us <b>collecting the funds</b> for <b>travel</b>, <b>residency</b> and <b>studio time</b>, we promise
you some <b>great music</b> by September and tons of <b>fun perks</b> in return for your
support. </p><p><b>***</b></p><p><b>(Nederlands) IN HET KORT</b></p><p>Top producer uit New York, Bryce Goggin, nodigt ons uit om onze eerste cd op te nemen in New York. Bryce Goggin is o.a. producer van Antony &amp; The Johnsons, Joan As Police Woman.<br/></p><p>Wij zijn C.

Van den Hende, BIC: GKCCBEBB. Mention ""crowdfunding"" + ""name perk"" + ""your emailadres!!""HOW THE STORY STARTED
We teamed
up as songwriters/musicians in 2014, aiming to write a bunch of killer pop
songs, so we could sell those songs to Rihanna and spend the royalties  by drinking cocktails on a sunny island forever
lasting. No kidding, that was the plan…
Unfortunately
we kinda liked our babies too much,  especially
“If Courtney Love (Has Found The Plane)”, inspired by how Courtney Love claimed
to have found the missing Malaysian plane. The song is also the reason for our band name C. Love Detectives. 
By
accident, this song was also broadcasted on our favorite Belgian radio station
Studio Brussels. No way back. Exit Rihanna dreams. Enter world domination, our
own private jets and you flying co-pilote to the Grammy’s with us. We can
dream, right? 
HOW THE STORY FLIPPED
After one
of our exhausting writing sessions we laid down on the carpet, listening to our
favourite music. When “The Deep Field” by Joan As Policewoman came along, we
agreed that the sound of that album was so damn good. Tired, slightly drunk and
for that reason also extremely fearless, we emailed the producer of that album,
saying ""we wanted him"" and ""we wanted him to want us too"" (those words exactly…). 
One hour
later he got back to us, saying he liked what he heard, asking us if we would
be interested to come to New York to record in his studio.
Enter Bryce
Goggin (Antony & the Johnsons, Pavement, Joan As Policewoman) in the C.
Love Detectives story.
WHERE STORY IS GOING TO
We wrote
the songs. We got the producer. So here’s the plan…
We’re
heading to NYC in June, recording our first EP with Bryce Goggin.
Release
planned in September, followed by some showcases and club concerts. 
Big goal is
playing the festivals of summer 2016. It’s a long shot, but we’re confident this
is the right order of steps.
WHY WE NEED YOU
We live in
Belgium (Divan) and The Netherlands (M.), so New York is quite a journey for
us. 
If you can
help us collecting the funds for travel, residency and studio time, we promise
you some great music by September and tons of fun perks in return for your
support. ***(Nederlands) IN HET KORTTop producer uit New York, Bryce Goggin, nodigt ons uit om onze eerste cd op te nemen in New York. Bryce Goggin is o.a. producer van Antony & The Johnsons, Joan As Police Woman.Wij zijn C.

EDITING AND MASTERING by Chris Rosser at Hollow Reed Arts in Asheville.

REPLICATION (making the CDs)  This will be done by Oasis CD.

DISTRIBUTION. This will get the album beyond my website and the trunk of my car. Again, this will be my first time doing this. 

•  •  •  •  •
THIS IS SCARY
I have never done anything like crowd funding before, but – trust me – this is how the business model of recording has changed. 
Every album brings it’s own challenges. Recording live is tricky and it takes smart professionals to help me do it.  But, for the way I perform, I want that live “vibe” so the listeners (you and your kids) will feel as if they are in the room. 
WHAT IF THERE IS FUNDING LEFT OVER?
Any leftover funds will go into the other album I will be releasing in October – A  grownup project called, Love at 85. This record will feature the beloved character, Marguerite Van Camp, MD, and will also be recorded at the International Storytelling Center later that same afternoon on May 30th.                           
TRULY, IT’S OKAY IF YOU CAN’T CONTRIBUTE…
… BUT if you could get the word out through social media and whatnot, I would be most grateful.
No kidding, I am grateful all the time. Thank you! – Andy",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Match&amp;Fuse tworzy pełna pasji grupa producentów. Od czterech lat promujemy bardzo orygnialną i innowacyjną muzykę organizując trasy obiecujących artystów i coroczne festiwale w europejskich stolicach. Jako grupa producentów z 6 krajów zrobiliśmy już trzy duże festiwale: w Londynie, Oslo, Rzymie, teraz czas na Warszawę!</p>
<p><br/>Zdobyliśmy już część funduszy, ale potrzebujemy jeszcze trochę, żeby pozwolić festiwalowi “rozwinąć skrzydła”, uzyskać najlepszy możliwy sprzęt techniczny i przede wszystkim umieścić publiczność - czyli Was - w samym centrum naszych działań.</p>
<p><br/>To publiczność tworzy festiwale. Zapytaj jakiegokolwiek muzyka czy jest coś lepszego niż gra dla buzującego energią tłumu. Nasz festiwal jest adresowany zarówno dla młodych i starszych poszukujących łatwopalnego jazz-punkowego brzmienia. Pomóż nam to zrealizować a z naszymi prezentami znajdziesz się w samym środku festiwalu!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Czego potrzebujemy i co Ty możesz otrzymać</h3>
<p><br/>Potrzebujemy jeszcze 1200 euro (4800 złotych) żeby dofinansować wszystkie obszary festiwalu: dźwięk, technicznych, gaże artystów, transport, hotele i materiały promocyjne. Mimo że zdobyliśmy już część pieniędzy bez tych dodatkowych środków nie damy rady!</p>
<p><br/>Odwdzięczymy się ekscytującymi i spersonalizowanymi prezentami - dostaniesz od nas specjalny streaming z piosenką, połączymy się z Tobą przez Skype z backstage’u, a jeśli będziesz w Polsce - oprowadzimy Cię po festiwalu, poznamy z naszą ekipą, z zespołami, nakarmimy Cię, a nawet damy lekcję muzyki i produkcji takiego wydarzenia, jakim jest festiwal! A do tego tyle muzyki, ile zmieści się na Twojej skrzynce, prezenty w postaci płyt CD i inne smakowite dobra muzyczne.</p>
<p><br/>To Ty stworzysz ten Festiwal!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Dlaczego warto nas wspierać?</h3>
<p><br/></p>

Match&Fuse tworzy pełna pasji grupa producentów. Od czterech lat promujemy bardzo orygnialną i innowacyjną muzykę organizując trasy obiecujących artystów i coroczne festiwale w europejskich stolicach. Jako grupa producentów z 6 krajów zrobiliśmy już trzy duże festiwale: w Londynie, Oslo, Rzymie, teraz czas na Warszawę!
Zdobyliśmy już część funduszy, ale potrzebujemy jeszcze trochę, żeby pozwolić festiwalowi “rozwinąć skrzydła”, uzyskać najlepszy możliwy sprzęt techniczny i przede wszystkim umieścić publiczność - czyli Was - w samym centrum naszych działań.
To publiczność tworzy festiwale. Zapytaj jakiegokolwiek muzyka czy jest coś lepszego niż gra dla buzującego energią tłumu. Nasz festiwal jest adresowany zarówno dla młodych i starszych poszukujących łatwopalnego jazz-punkowego brzmienia. Pomóż nam to zrealizować a z naszymi prezentami znajdziesz się w samym środku festiwalu!

Czego potrzebujemy i co Ty możesz otrzymać
Potrzebujemy jeszcze 1200 euro (4800 złotych) żeby dofinansować wszystkie obszary festiwalu: dźwięk, technicznych, gaże artystów, transport, hotele i materiały promocyjne. Mimo że zdobyliśmy już część pieniędzy bez tych dodatkowych środków nie damy rady!
Odwdzięczymy się ekscytującymi i spersonalizowanymi prezentami - dostaniesz od nas specjalny streaming z piosenką, połączymy się z Tobą przez Skype z backstage’u, a jeśli będziesz w Polsce - oprowadzimy Cię po festiwalu, poznamy z naszą ekipą, z zespołami, nakarmimy Cię, a nawet damy lekcję muzyki i produkcji takiego wydarzenia, jakim jest festiwal! A do tego tyle muzyki, ile zmieści się na Twojej skrzynce, prezenty w postaci płyt CD i inne smakowite dobra muzyczne.
To Ty stworzysz ten Festiwal!

Dlaczego warto nas wspierać?

M&F produkuje tournee i festiwale w całej Europie.  Naszym celem to, by publiczność była umieszczona w centrum tych działań. Wspieramy nowych, ekscytujących artystów, pomagamy im osiągnąć kolejny szczebel kariery,  rozwijając również ich poziom muzyczny, brzmienie na żywo i maestrię wykonania.Każde wydarzenie sygnowane nazwą Match&Fuse kipi energią i prowokuje doborem stylistyk, czasami przedstawiając awangradowe brzmienia, innym razem mocne groovy, ale zawsze tworząc niezapomniane przeżycie dla słuchaczy i muzyków.

be invested into marketing the Mobile Music Box through a
professionally-designed website, stickers, and buttons. 



Stretch goal: If I surpass my goal and reach $7,000, I will use the additional funds to replace the laptop that was stolen from my studio earlier this year. Any donations above that will be used to replenish art supplies as they are used for activities, and otherwise fund future programming ideas.

Put your investment in good hands!

This
endeavor is a culmination of over fifteen years of experience teaching art,
music, and environmental studies in Chicago and internationally. Currently artist-in-residence through
the University of Chicago's Arts + Public Life and Center for the Study of
Race Politics & Culture; founding director of
Chicago Public Schools All City Performing Arts ""ALT-City""
contemporary music ensemble; and actively on Urban Gateways' teaching artist
roster, I have gained the respect of many other educators, administrators, and
students. You can trust my commitment to complete the Mobile
Music Box and activate it in as many creative and
meaningful ways as possible.

                
Help me make an impact in our city!

The Mobile Music Box is not simply a
project idea of mine. This vehicle is an extension of my professional goal to
deliver innovative, thoughtful, and high-quality cultural education where it is most needed. Every time I share this idea
it is well-received, which adds to my confidence in the potential impact of the
Mobile Music Box after it is complete and I can begin programming. 
I strongly believe my goal
is reasonable, given the scope of what the Mobile Music Box can provide and the
support I have been shown so far. The money you invest in this campaign will provide all I need to bring the cart to communities across Chicago.
                 
 
Other
Ways You Can Help:
Not everyone will be
able to donate. But please consider sharing this page throughout your network. Use Indiegogo's sharing tools help get the word out!
Lastly, the Mobile
Music Box is seeking in-kind donations of recycled materials for
instrument-making workshops. I am specifically looking for: 



PVC of any size
(saxophones)

PVC couplings 

Corrugated Piping (horns/giant whistles)


Other plastic or
rubber tubing (whistles and flutes)


Bass guitar strings
(""mini-bass"" instruments)


Stethoscopes
(mini-bass)


Steel cans
(bongos/shakers)


Bottle caps
(castanets)


Gently
used arts & crafts supplies; Particularly colored tape (electrical, duct,
masking) and balloons.

For my third EP, I’m doing something quite different and I’m really excited about it.



It’s going to be an acoustic EP: Always wanted to try it, now’s the chance.
It will be recorded and produced entirely for free with the help of friends and a little extra time, so I don’t have to raise any money for that!
It will be entirely inspired by a two week trip to Asia where I will be spending time with friends who are serving the disadvantaged, specifically those vulnerable to various forms of oppression, including human trafficking.



What to expect from this EP? The length will be six songs; three that I will write leading up to the departure of my trip and three that I will write upon returning. What I hope to experience and to share is the transformation that takes place in my heart. I have fears, anticipations, motives, preconceptions and so many other things going on in my head that I believe will be deeply impacted by this trip. I hope to come out the other end as someone who will write better songs and tell a clearer version of the stories we’re formed by. There’s so much beauty in life, and yet so much suffering. I want to be better at dealing with this tension and making a positive difference amidst it.

To say thank you for giving to this project, I’ve set up different thank you packages that are yours to claim including pictures, journal excerpts and the songs from the EP. Check them out in the perks! I’m excited to have you along for this story.

Beyond the EP...


If you were wondering, I won’t be travelling alone! I’m glad to be going with friends of mine, who are family to me, to encourage our friends in Asia. All money raised beyond my goal will go towards helping cover the travel costs of others in our team and to support the on-the-ground work in Asia. To help keep production costs as low as possible, this EP will be distributed digitally only.

Other ways to help
Maybe this is something that your network, friends, family or followers would be interested in following or investing in. If this is something you’d like to see happen, please share this campaign with your community to help make this trip and this EP possible!
Also keep in touch with me over Facebook, Twitter or Instagram to see the ongoing adventures of my music.
Thanks so much for your time and consideration towards this project.
Sincerely yours,
Joey",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

 Help the New York Jazzharmonic premiere a composition penned in 1987 by music legend Fred Hellerman, and never before performed in public.  Fred was an original member of The Weavers, founded in the 1950's by him and the legendary Pete Seeger.  For the last 29+ years, Fred has been waiting to hear an orchestra perform his 10 minute masterpiece, ""Fourths of July.""


The New York Jazzharmonic is a big band that plays primarily swinging jazz, but with strong crossover elements of classical and world music.  
 The free concert is set for Tuesday, June, 28, 2016 as part of the Washington Square Music Festival.  We expect an audience of close to 2,000 people.

While on in years and unable to travel comfortably these days, Fred is as excited as can be to hear the composition played by live musicians.

<h4>More about the Cuba Project</h4>
<p>As a duo travelling to Cuba we have the opportunity to be cultural ambassadors, to build bridges through music across language and country, to nurture understanding, compassion and respect for our shared human experience. Our goal is to give voice to an underrepresented community in the Classical music field, and bring something back to share with our community. Our intention is to record a CD of music for cello and guitar by Cuban, Brazilian, Argentinian and American composers. Included on the CD would be Lezcano’s own duo. <br/></p>
<br/><h4>Costs</h4>
<p>One of the largest expenses associated with this project is the cost of purchasing the cello to be donated. IN addition, traveling with a cello and bow requires an extra airplane seat, as cellos cannot be checked as baggage. The other large expense is the cost of studio time. We have chosen to work with the Fraser studio at WGBH in Boston, and though they have a reasonable rate, it takes about 15 hours of recording time to create a one hour CD. Other costs include editing, printing and production of the CD.</p>
<p>A basic break down of costs:</p>
<p>$3, 000 Cello and Bow </p>
<p>$1,000 plane tickets</p>
<p>$1,300 tour costs</p>
<p>$3,500 CD recording</p>
<p>Total: $8,800</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Risks</h4>
<p>We run the risk of falling short of the fundraising goal. This is an ambitious endeavor, and we have little of our own money to devote to this project. If we are unable to reach our goal, we will simply take our time with CD project, recording as we have the money to fund it. Since we have already committed to our trip to Cuba, the tour and travel expenses will take first priority.</p>

</div>While studying photography in my sophomore year in college I was given the task to discover an 'alternative process'. Cyanotype, also knows as blue prints or sun prints can be a rewarding yet somewhat frustrating form of photographic printing. It involves coating paper in a two part UV light sensitive emulsion and once dry placing the coated paper attached to a negative under a UV light source to expose. I have used the sun for years but this can be very frustrating. Exposure times can range from 5 minutes to 30 minutes using the sun method depending on the time of day, season, and weather, therefore a good amount of waste can occur with under and overexposed pieces. With this project I am hoping to raise enough money to purchase a pricey UV exposure unit to use in my home. This will take a good bit of the guess work out of the printing process and allow me to better focus on creating new art rather than spending time chasing the sun. <p></p></div>","While studying photography in my sophomore year in college I was given the task to discover an 'alternative process'.

<p><b>But now is the time to give back to

<p>We need your support to pay back all
of the great musicians and bands that make this happen. We need to hit our
$10,000 goal – not only because it provides some monetary value back to the
performers but also because it sends the message that we value the time and
effort of each and every performer that will grace a stage during this year’s
festival. </p>
<p>How will our funding be distributed?
Evenly. We are going to attempt to pay each band or performer on a per capita
basis, meaning that each and every person will get the same amount. This
festival was borne out of the idea of community and the greater good and we
hope to spread compensation around fairly. </p>
<p>What can you expect this summer?</p>
<p>Family-friendly daytime activities
include live music on three outdoor stages, three indoor venues, multiple food
vendors stationed around the festival, artist exhibitions, mobile art carts, a
pop-up pinball arcade at Artists Image Resource and other activities.</p>
<p>Nighttime activities include music
and events spread throughout the neighborhood with over 80 different local acts
performing in 9 unique venues, all within walking distance.</p>
<p>The Deutschtown Music Festival has,
in only two years, gained a reputation as one of the premiere summer music
festivals in Pittsburgh. <span><br/></span></p>

<p>Welcome to my indiegogo page! I'm Alexander Stewart singer, songwriter and musician, thanks for popping by!</p>
<p>Following the release of my first album ‘All or nothing at all’ I’ve been working together, writing, arranging and performing songs, with some amazing musicians. My new album will be a collection of both original songs, and some new takes on tunes that I have known, loved and want to share with you, on what will be my most ambitious project to date.</p>
<p>The self-funded album will feature a varying line up from full big band arrangements, orchestrated scores, and backing vocals. The album mixes a blend of jazz. pop, motown and original songs I am excited for you to hear!  All aspects of the process invariably take time and money to create and I am finally in a position to begin recording, and with your support, the album can be finished!</p>
<p>With the preproduction of the album complete, studio time and musicians booked here in the UK, the final stage of the album will be to record strings with an orchestra. Financial constraints make this essential part of the album almost impossible to fund here in the UK. As a result I have found some incredible musicians in Prague, with whom this part of the project can become viable.</p>
<p><span>It’s with your involvement I can complete this album and share it with you on it's release this summer.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Become a supporter!</h3>
<div>We need at least £5000 (around 25% of the total costs) to complete the album. Your money will go towards:<ul>

<p>This project is my dream. Ever since I was a kid, I have
wanted to be a DJ. As a kid, my family used always have get togethers and
because my parents had a large music collection, it was usually our
responsibility to bring the music. As I got older, I was the one who organized
and brought the music. It was always the expectation then that I was in charge
of the music for all parties. That’s how my love of music began. I cannot
imagine my life without music. I love playing, organizing, coordinating music
for people. Whether it’s at parties, functions, or even driving friends in my
car, I always enjoy selecting music and playing it for people and watching their
reactions as they enjoy the music that I play for them. Friends have told me
that when I’m DJ’ing, I never look as confident, happy or enthusiastic. I
cannot explain the joy I get when I’m DJ’ing, when I play a song people don’t
expect and go crazy, or if I mix a crazy set and get an amazing reaction.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1368900/files/20150409094810-dj_crowd.jpg?1428598090"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>Overall I have been DJ’ing for more than 20 years and there
is nothing I enjoy doing more. Unfortunately over time, I have encountered many
obstacles which have prevented me from fully achieving my goals and dreams.
This is where I need your help in making my dreams a reality. I am on IndieGoGo
with this project/campaign, not to create something innovative or a new
technological wonder. It is just to make a dream come true, and to share my
love and passion for music. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1368901/files/20150409094837-dj_quote.png?1428598117"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>Nowadays, there are many people out there who want to be or
call themselves DJ’s, only because they have a lap top and a computer program,
or an app which lets them play and mix music. I believe that a DJ needs to DJ
with Vinyl records at some point in their lives to actually be a good or real
DJ. Technology is a great tool, which makes a DJ’s life easier, but shouldn’t
be the road one uses to call themselves a DJ. When I was going full steam
ahead, I had a collection of 1,500 cassettes and cd’s, and 500 vinyl records
along with 1GB of music on my hard drive. I was DJ’ing in bars, pubs and clubs,
on campus radio, live events, private parties and so on and having the time of
my life. That’s when I started to lose it all, literally. Whether through
damage, theft or accident, I ended up losing close $20,000 in music and
equipment. That has been something which has been difficult to come back from
and as such I couldn’t continue doing what I love. I have since been able to
grow my digital music collection, which is something I can thank technology
for, however much more is needed to reclaim the success, passion and love I
once had for this profession. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1368905/files/20150409094927-images5SWG69SJ.jpg?1428598167"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>I have worked many hours in different professions, whether
it be in Operations, Marketing, Digital Marketing, Social Media and so on, but
DJing is the only thing I am actually good at and music is where my passion
lies. I remember going to clubs with my friends and being able to sing along
with songs word for word as other DJ’s played them, or being able to tell my
friends what the next song a DJ was mixing in was before anyone could hear or
tell. I can listen to music and be fascinated by samples being used and
learning about the history of music and how one song can contribute samples to
several other songs. This is the love affair I have with music, and this is
what I want through this campaign. </p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I did have the opportunity to DJ at
local bars here that had little equipment for me to use, but it was something
to get my foot back into the door. Then, right as I was getting back into it, I
had received some bad news with regards to my health. For years, I had been
suffering from type 2 diabetes. As a result, a couple of years ago, my health
had deteriorated quite a bit due to complications from Diabetes, which included
Diabetic Retinopathy (decrease/loss of vision), decline in kidney function and
a massive decrease in hemoglobin levels. With all this, I had to stop working,
and start treatments and medications to get better. I has visited doctor’s,
hospitals, specialists to fix the problems I was having. Because of my vision
problems, I could not properly drive, see a computer screen and at times even
open my eyes because they were too sensitive to light and all I was seeing was
brightness and spots. I have since been going in for laser and injection
treatments for my eyes, which have now gotten better. My kidneys are still an

<br/></div>","Did you ever have a dream? Of course we all have…
This project is my dream. Ever since I was a kid, I have
wanted to be a DJ. As a kid, my family used always have get togethers and
because my parents had a large music collection, it was usually our
responsibility to bring the music. As I got older, I was the one who organized
and brought the music. It was always the expectation then that I was in charge
of the music for all parties. That’s how my love of music began. I cannot
imagine my life without music. I love playing, organizing, coordinating music
for people. Whether it’s at parties, functions, or even driving friends in my
car, I always enjoy selecting music and playing it for people and watching their
reactions as they enjoy the music that I play for them. Friends have told me
that when I’m DJ’ing, I never look as confident, happy or enthusiastic. I
cannot explain the joy I get when I’m DJ’ing, when I play a song people don’t
expect and go crazy, or if I mix a crazy set and get an amazing reaction.
Overall I have been DJ’ing for more than 20 years and there
is nothing I enjoy doing more. Unfortunately over time, I have encountered many
obstacles which have prevented me from fully achieving my goals and dreams.
This is where I need your help in making my dreams a reality. I am on IndieGoGo
with this project/campaign, not to create something innovative or a new
technological wonder. It is just to make a dream come true, and to share my
love and passion for music. 
Nowadays, there are many people out there who want to be or
call themselves DJ’s, only because they have a lap top and a computer program,
or an app which lets them play and mix music. I believe that a DJ needs to DJ
with Vinyl records at some point in their lives to actually be a good or real
DJ. Technology is a great tool, which makes a DJ’s life easier, but shouldn’t
be the road one uses to call themselves a DJ. When I was going full steam
ahead, I had a collection of 1,500 cassettes and cd’s, and 500 vinyl records
along with 1GB of music on my hard drive. I was DJ’ing in bars, pubs and clubs,
on campus radio, live events, private parties and so on and having the time of
my life. That’s when I started to lose it all, literally. Whether through
damage, theft or accident, I ended up losing close $20,000 in music and
equipment. That has been something which has been difficult to come back from
and as such I couldn’t continue doing what I love. I have since been able to
grow my digital music collection, which is something I can thank technology
for, however much more is needed to reclaim the success, passion and love I
once had for this profession. 
I have worked many hours in different professions, whether
it be in Operations, Marketing, Digital Marketing, Social Media and so on, but
DJing is the only thing I am actually good at and music is where my passion
lies. I remember going to clubs with my friends and being able to sing along
with songs word for word as other DJ’s played them, or being able to tell my
friends what the next song a DJ was mixing in was before anyone could hear or
tell. I can listen to music and be fascinated by samples being used and
learning about the history of music and how one song can contribute samples to
several other songs. This is the love affair I have with music, and this is
what I want through this campaign. 
A couple of years ago, I did have the opportunity to DJ at
local bars here that had little equipment for me to use, but it was something
to get my foot back into the door. Then, right as I was getting back into it, I
had received some bad news with regards to my health. For years, I had been
suffering from type 2 diabetes. As a result, a couple of years ago, my health
had deteriorated quite a bit due to complications from Diabetes, which included
Diabetic Retinopathy (decrease/loss of vision), decline in kidney function and
a massive decrease in hemoglobin levels. With all this, I had to stop working,
and start treatments and medications to get better. I has visited doctor’s,
hospitals, specialists to fix the problems I was having. Because of my vision
problems, I could not properly drive, see a computer screen and at times even
open my eyes because they were too sensitive to light and all I was seeing was
brightness and spots. I have since been going in for laser and injection
treatments for my eyes, which have now gotten better. My kidneys are still an
issue. They will never get back to 100% functionality, but as long as they
stabilize, I will avoid Dialysis and/or a Kidney transplant. That is something
which scares me every day. I am getting better though, but am not out of the
woods. With my low hemoglobin levels, I am constantly tired and sleepy. I can
estimate that I am in bed or asleep for 15 to 18 hours a day. I am not sure
whether it is because of weakness due to the low blood count level, whether it
is depression, or whether it is because I have nothing else to do, nor the
energy to do it. 
Motivation is what I am looking for now! I have had a dream
of beating this and fulfilling my dreams of producing and DJ’ing music and now
is when I need to do this more than ever. I am not telling you all this for you
to feel sorry for me, or to get sympathy. I had all this happen, and am now
trying to move on and move forward in life doing something I love to do, have a
passion for, do something I am good at, and something with makes me and other
people happy!

It will be sent out through a variety of media sources including a large dispersion on the internet, and having a lasting effect on people's points of view.     Risks & Challenges       Any American who travels to Iran holds the risk of political complications.  But I have been invited by the TEDx organization, and they will see to it that I am safe and well cared for.     Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  You can post this on Facebook, or twitter, or the social media site of your choosing.  Look for the Indiegogo share tools!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

(English and German) of approx. 60 minutes in which Wigge will show the
audience how to choose, train and break a world record within 10 weeks. Wigge
will then himself try and break his own 3 world records.
BUT WHERE WILL MY MONEY GO:
As you can imagine, high-end TV production is not cheap and here is what's needed to make this DVD a truly amazing experience.



Multiple HD camera filming cost

Crew travel and accommodation expenses (three cities)

Filming permits
Wigge's four months preparation period
Props 

Scripting


Editing
and post-production.

Graphic design

Manufacturing of the DVDs and international distribution.

Marketing and promotion
Campaign manager

Fulfilling all the perks





WHY SHOULD I DONATE:




To see Wigge push himself to the limit and find out if he'll manage to break these hilarious world records.


To learn how to
break your own world record.


To support Wigge
in his quest to prove that anything is possible in this world if you set your mind
to it.


Or simply to have
a good laugh.

Some More Real Talk:

 Honestly, creating music in a professional environment as I am working toward with this project can give a new venue for that music to become what it's meant to be. Recording on my own has been successful as I could have hoped and many have been heavily impacted by the music I've created in a bedroom or practice hall, in which I have been tremendously humbled and blessed.

Just to be totally real, there is a lot of mediocre music out there. Along with other artists, I am reaching toward the goal of bringing music back into the realm of beauty and adornment for life. I want to experiment, grow, try new things, fail, and try again. I believe in music and I know it can affect people in a mighty way.



I wouldn't be asking for help if I didn't believe it to be entirely plausible and have the work ethic to carry it out.

<div>I think the answer to that lies in the music. If you enjoy music that have roots in blues, rock and soul, music that have real drumkits and beautiful guitar solo's and vocals with sincerity and warmth - then I think you are going to love this album.

<p>For me, music is about connection. Connection to other people and to the Universe or God or exsistence or what you prefer to call it. I believe that music is a healing force and that it can help open up the doors to emotional chambers that have been sealed off for years or even decades. It can release the grief never processed or the joy we forgot to feel. It can remind us of who we really are.</p>
<p><b>This album deals with</b> the feelings of despair, anger, longing &amp; hope. I have written the songs from a personal experience of crash and burn.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Over the course of one year we have been working hard to bring this EP into fruition, investing not just our own time and resources, but also of those around us that believe in us and our work. Thanks to technology and the internet, breaking into the music industry from the underground scene in this day and age is not as difficult as it used to be during the monopolistic reign of record labels, but it is no walk in the park either. </p>
<p>Aside from the expenses we've listed above, there are a lot of hidden costs for equipment and other factors, that are essential to actualising our vision. As independent artists, we understand that opportunity isn't something that will be handed to us on a silver platter, it is something we must create. We have poured our hearts and souls into this EP, which is what we hope will be the a solid foundation for a successful, sustainable music career. </p>
<p>We understand there will always be challenges to learn from along the way, but we are willing to give it all we've got, rise up above these trials and continue producing what we love. </p>
<p>We've written, recorded, mixed and mastered the songs in Elixir; we just need the best possible avenue for our music to be heard, and it all begins with you :)</p>

FULL MOON YOUTH: AWAKEN YOUR SOUL
The Essence of the EP
 
Full Moon Youth is about growing into and embracing your own personal power. 
""I wrote it as an invitation and a challenge to step out of one's comfort zone and discover the adventure and treasures that await when you are fully activated, and living with as much presence as you can muster."" - Bianca Yuzon
In astrology, the Full Moon phase of the month represents a time when we ‘’reap what we’ve sown’’ from the work we put in during past cycles; a time when most of our dreams and desires manifest. 
Out of the three tracks in our first indie-electronic EP titled Elixir, we chose Full Moon Youth to be the main single because we believe in it's message to inspire and empower others.
 

YUZON: THE AVATAR AND THE ALCHEMIST 



Meet the Band 


Full Moon Youth marks the beginning of a journey of awakening your soul’s true essence, whatever that may be. For YUZON, it's all about our music.                                                              


BIANCA YUZON (VOCALS, LYRICS)

 
Ever since I was a wee wolf pup I've always felt persistent tug, a stirring in my soul: and in the arts I found my home. 
Singing, acting, writing and other forms of Divine expression--made themselves known in sublime succession.
Through the years this spark has been honed and has grown, it has blossomed (it burns!), with a voice of its own. (that tends to sound like mine ;) )
With the music (this journey), comes the urge to create--a gift I must share, for life will not wait. 
 
Psyched to meet you :) Bianca here, your young spirit old-soul cosmic pal.


It has always been my absolute dream to be an international singer-songwriter, (writing for myself and others), which is something I've worked towards for as long as I can remember.
I am a firm believer in heeding our soul's call, and answering it by giving it everything we've got to shape our destiny, but I also know that this isn't something we can achieve without help.
I believe there is a greater purpose to every occurrence and there is no such thing as a 'mere coincidence': the fact that you have somehow landed on this page strikes me as a good sign that our destiny paths were meant to intertwine in a meaningful way. If you are reading this now, Thank You for welcoming us into your present reality, and for your positive energy :)
Let us all celebrate our own inner truth, let us dare, let us dance! 
This is our Full Moon Youth.


 

This band is a collaborative effort drawing influence and experience from across continents. Experimenting with pop music to offer something different from you're use to. Contributions to this campaign will give us the platform to share more music and performances with you, to develop a wider following so that we can pursue our ambition to complete an Album.

A DIFFERENT KIND OF ELIXIR: YOUR PERKS AND PRIVILEGES 

We have many exciting perks in store for you: ranging from our digital download music bundles to physical copies of the EP, in the form of old school-cool, retro vinyls! Bianca has put together elemental Spirit Packs with her favourite, specially curated items to aid you in your meditation and wellness practice.
 

 
We are also collaborating with three visual artists from the Philippines: Nikki Valenzuela, who has rendered a surreal water colour painting inspired by the EP's namesake track, 'Elixir', Corina Borromeo, with her striking acrylic portrayal of our song 'Feathers', and designer Feanne Hontiveros Maurico, who has conjured up Full Moon Youth in ink.  And speaking of collaborating, this could be your chance to team up with us on your very own, exclusive YUZON track!
 
Swansea, Wales, is a place we hold dear (most of the EP was produced and recorded here at the BBC Studious), so for our MEGA PERK, we would like to have you pampered with a weekend getaway at The Coran, Luxury Resort and Spa!  
 

...all this and more on the other side of the pledge rainbow ;)   

 
           
DRAWING THE MUSIC FROM THE SILENCE



 
The Impact            


 

Risks & Challenges
Over the course of one year we have been working hard to bring this EP into fruition, investing not just our own time and resources, but also of those around us that believe in us and our work. Thanks to technology and the internet, breaking into the music industry from the underground scene in this day and age is not as difficult as it used to be during the monopolistic reign of record labels, but it is no walk in the park either. 
Aside from the expenses we've listed above, there are a lot of hidden costs for equipment and other factors, that are essential to actualising our vision. As independent artists, we understand that opportunity isn't something that will be handed to us on a silver platter, it is something we must create. We have poured our hearts and souls into this EP, which is what we hope will be the a solid foundation for a successful, sustainable music career. 
We understand there will always be challenges to learn from along the way, but we are willing to give it all we've got, rise up above these trials and continue producing what we love. 
We've written, recorded, mixed and mastered the songs in Elixir; we just need the best possible avenue for our music to be heard, and it all begins with you :)
 




 
They say ''it take a village to raise a child'', but these days it takes a whole community of social networks and forest of supportive people! With your much appreciated contribution, YUZON will be able to share it's unique light with the world, and hopefully inspire others to find and honour their own too.

I lost my job and my ""American Dream"" in 2009, and found my true calling, a year later, in music. A relative newcomer to writing, singing and playing, I set out on a motorcycle with a guitar strapped to my back, and played my way across the country, writing songs for an album, funded by a 2013 Indiegogo campaign, that was released in May 2015.</div><div> 
<p>That album, National Anthem, sparked a powder keg of a year in 2015. The single, Steal the Evening Sky broke into the Top 40 on the Country Charts (New Music Weekly) and spent four consecutive weeks at #1 on The Iceman's Top 40 New Country Artist Chart. The album has been selected for Grammy nomination consideration in three categories. And, buzz from the album has secured headlining shows across the country as well as opening slots for several major headlining acts to be announced soon.</p>
<p>In July, I was hand selected as one of the flagship artists for Nashville's Smokeshow Entertainment. With Smokeshow's recording, booking and marketing reach, I made the decision to move to Nashville and jump head first into the deep waters of the Nashville music scene. An incredible group of musicians, all from the RI, Massachusetts area, have committed to take this leap with me, and we are prepared to work hard on developing the songs for the new album and becoming the best live band in Nashville, and then the country.</p>
<p>With two stadium shows already booked and two demos for the new album already done, there is buzz throughout the industry  that a breakthrough is imminent. We just need one big push to get us across the finish line... That's where you, the believers since day one, come in to help one last time. Let's lift off. To the moon and back...</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED... WHERE THE MONEY WILL GO</strong></p>
</div><div> <p>- The Album!!! With 18 songs already written for the new album, we will begin studio time as soon as we hit Nashville, and have access to some of the best producers in Nashville and will be recording in Sony's Nashville Studios. This is an expense where we absolutely cannot cut costs as we have in the past, where we've made good recordings, but not amazing recordings... the kind that will get us the radio play we need to support our touring efforts and take us to the top. We estimate studio costs at a minimum of $20,000 and likely more, but we are hopeful our touring revenues will help cover our needs going forward. $20,000<br/></p>
<p>- The Move!!! A band of 6 are moving to Nashville to commit full-time to this dream! We need a BIG Uhaul, a lot of gas for that Uhaul, gas for the three other cars coming to Nashville, and tolls etc... We estimate our moving cost $3,000</p>

<p>- Travel / Touring expense!!! Our new management team is starting to book us stadium gigs across the country. We already have two on our schedule, starting November. We will need to get the band to those gigs!. $3,500</p>
