<h3>Мёртвые Земли</h3>
<p align=""right""><em>Год 1876, альтернативная история.</em></p>
<p>Мстительный шаман по прозвищу Ворон открыл дверь в Ад и выпустил маниту — демонических тварей, которые наполнили мир магией и монстрами. Одни герои пытаются обратить их силу против неумолимо множащегося зла.</p>
<p>Другие полагаются на шестизарядные револьверы и безумную науку.</p>
<p>А некоторые настолько суровы, что даже смерть им не помеха. Они восстают из могил, чтобы выйти один на один против маниту в борьбе за невероятное могущество и свою душу...</p>
<h3>Настольная ролевая игра</h3>
<p>Deadlands: Мёртвые Земли — это настольная ролевая игра в жанре альтернативной истории с элементами мистики на базе правил «Дневника авантюриcта» (Savage Worlds). Она посвящена событиям на фронтире 1876-го года. Гражданская война окончилась весьма неожиданно. Объединения Севера и Юга так и не случилось. В землях, наполненных как смогом железнодорожных войн, так и магией индейских племён, у каждого есть шанс найти дорогу к Источнику вечной молодости или Эльдорадо, стать знаменитым стрелком или безумным учёным, обыграть в карты самого дока Холлидея и принять участие в драке на крыше поезда, столкнуться с невыразимо жуткими мифологическими чудовищами и коварными колдунами, встретить свою смерть в прериях Аризоны и даже после этого не окончить свою игру с судьбой. Здесь оживают легенды Дикого запада.</p>

<h3><strong>Welcome to the Great Britain Ultimate World Games IndieGoGo page!</strong></h3>
<p>The World Games are a huge multi-sport tournament organised every 4 years by the International Olympic Committee, providing a high profile opportunity to showcase up and coming sports. It is the highest level for our sport and after coming home with a silver medal from the World Championships 2012 in Japan, GB want to go for gold. </p>
<p>The squad are currently training hard to represent Great Britain in this event, where they will be competing against the best in the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ultimate Frisbee in the UK receives no funding and all training and tournament costs are met by the players themselves.</p>
<p>We need your help to take us to the World Games in Colombia and go for gold!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where the Funds Go</strong></h3>
<p>It's time to take Ultimate Frisbee in the UK to the next level. In order to be the best, we need to train like professional athletes. We have team training 3 weekends a month and a demanding 20 hour weekly fitness and skills programme. The majority of players have to fit this in alongside fulltime work. </p>
<p>In addition to individual players’ training and tournament costs, we also need to fund the costs of our coach, physio and two reserve players.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Coach, Physio, and Reserves to attend warm-up games: £2,500</p>
<p>Coach and Physio to attend World Games in Colombia: £2,500</p>
<p><strong>Initial target:                                                                               £5,000</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we can raise more than our initial target, the money raised will go towards the following team expenses:</p>
<p>Reserves attending World Games in Colombia:                       £2,500</p>
<p>Strength and conditioning training:                                        £1,200</p>
<p>Venue hire for team trainings:                                               £6,900</p>
<p>Ongoing physiotherapy expenses:                                         £1,200</p>
<p>Team costs for warm-up games (13 players):                          £2,500</p>
<p>Team costs for Columbia (13 players):                                   £16,250</p>
<p><strong>Total GB World Games team expenses:                                             £35,550</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Please take a look at our gifts for donations – <strong>thank you!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>For the players on the team, Ultimate Frisbee is their absolute passion. Having played on average for over 8 years, the World Games is seen as the pinnacle of their careers.</p>
<p>For most, Ultimate Frisbee is more than just playing the sport they love at the highest elite level, they also work hard to develop others and increase the sports reach. Many coach or captain their own club or junior teams in order to give back to the Ultimate community.</p>
<p>As it is an amateur sport, elite players who don’t have the means to fund themselves, unfortunately have to drop out of GB teams unless we can support them through sponsorship and donation drives like this.</p>
Your donation will help to ensure that GB can take the best team possible, regardless of funds and allow the players to concentrate on their training and development work.</div>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Red Panda Games is an independent developer in Seattle, WA.  We originally launched Bipo: Mystery of the Red Panda two years ago, which is an RPG puzzle-adventure, but with no fighting.  We decided to launch a visual novel game because we wanted to compete in a niche market that we believe is currently underrepresented. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Right now the game is good, but we want it to be great!  We will have to improve some things in order to have a profitable game, and additional funding will help us to release sooner than later.  I have spent two years and an incredible amount of time and money on developing this game, and I would really like to finish as soon as possible.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

Red Panda Games is an independent developer in Seattle, WA.  We originally launched Bipo: Mystery of the Red Panda two years ago, which is an RPG puzzle-adventure, but with no fighting.  We decided to launch a visual novel game because we wanted to compete in a niche market that we believe is currently underrepresented. 


The Impact
Right now the game is good, but we want it to be great!  We will have to improve some things in order to have a profitable game, and additional funding will help us to release sooner than later.  I have spent two years and an incredible amount of time and money on developing this game, and I would really like to finish as soon as possible.

<h3>Hello ! </h3>
<p>We are a team of two working on our first release since six months now as a side project. </p>
<p>I'm a sound designer in the video games industry and I'm planning to go indie and make games. I'm learning programming since two years now and worked on my week-ends and nights on this game.</p>
<p>Now I'm almost free so <strong>I will work on it full time. </strong></p>
<p>As an esport fan since BW, I play SC2 a lot and wanted to make this game because I just wish to play it. My girlfriend is doing the graphics, she's a beginner but I think her art is good.</p>
<p>Why do I need money ?</p>
<p>To upgrade my Unity license to pro and to maybe buy a mac-mini and an iphone to be able to compile the game for iOs(you need these with unity). </p>
<p>The game will be released on Android and Iphone first and Pc and Mac a bit  later. The interface is mobile friendly but we will probably modify the desktop version to be more adapted to PC/MAC users. </p>
<p>The game looks pretty casual but it's a bit complex, not as much as Football manager maybe but i'm trying to do my best to offer a deep system to players. </p>
<p>At first it was pure management but I added a kind of simplified RTS, you can see your players create units move them on a simple map, attack etc. (We did the three races of SC2).</p>
<p>You can play yourself (not on tourney mode) and take the control on a game for instance. (I know its no more management but it's fun).</p>
<p>I'm not hiding that the main inspiration is Starcraft but we tried to not copy directly the units and designs of Blizzard. We did 100 (maybe more to come) caricaturals players and casters in pixel art. </p>
<p><strong>The game for now has a Tourney system, trading, objects and shop system, you can choose special trainings and manage your players in details. There is a complex and evolving IA, an almost infinite pool of players as they are generated randomly(except for the pros).  Some new features will come...</strong></p>
<p>If you like the idea, help me buy stuff that I need to finish this. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The History of This Keyboard </h2>
<p><span>The Terpstra Keyboard began as an American Festival of Microtonal Music production made with initial support from the Maldeb Foundation. It was then supplementally co-funded by Garnet Willis who provided majority prototype development funding through a successful Canada Council arts grant.</span></p>
<p><span>The keyboard layout 
follows a design proposed by Siemen Terpstra; all of the detailed 
engineering was done by Dylan Horvath from Cortex Design, in 
collaboration with artistic director Garnet Willis, advisor Joel 
Mandelbaum and executive director Johnny Reinhard of the AFMM.<br/><br/>Only two prototypes were ever built and we're raising money to bring this project back to life - improved and packed with amazing new features.</span></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">It's Time for Advancement</h2>
The 7-white/5-black classical keyboard, together with the tuning system based on 12 equal divisions of the octave became standards after Europe came out of the Middle Ages. Since then, there has been continuous progress and advancement in all areas - except music - where evolution has stalled. But not for everyone.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Vision Behind Funding</h2>
The Terpstra has been originally designed as a MIDI controller, with key mechanics capable of unprecedented expressivity. We have decided to redesign the PCBs and upgrade connectivity to USB and wireless OSC (Open Sound Control) in addition to standard MIDI and to add RGB LED keycaps that would change color according to layout changes.<br/><br/>Making these a reality would open up the door to many other possibilities. Depending on the on-board computer's DSP capabilities, the controller could generate and send visuals through HDMI output, by creating patterns based on the harmonic relationships between the notes played. Wireless connectivity would allow a hand-held device like a smart-phone or tablet to control the settings on the keyboard by changing tunings, creating presets and even become a real-time synthesizer for the controller.<br/><br/>In order to program the Terpstra, we first have to build some prototypes, but they are cost prohibitive to make in a limited quantity. The only way to reduce costs is to build at least 20. This way, people interested in giving us a hand will get a completely functional prototype, though limited regarding extra features, until further development.<br/><br/>In other words, help us fund this project and take home one of the available keyboards, at a fraction of the market price. As we continue with development, you will receive free updates that will activate functions like continuous controller keys, OSC, interactive learning games using the RGB LED keycaps or whatever new idea we might come up with - provided the hardware can handle it. You could of course program it based on your specific needs, or join the other campaign supporters to create an open-source software community around the Terpstra.<br/><br/><p> </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What You Get:<br/>Detailed Description of the Perks</h2>
<b>Your Name on the Website</b><br/>Get your name published on on Terpstra's forthcoming official homepage, immortalized on the ""About"" section, under the title ""The People Who Made This Possible"". This list is going to be kept as long as the Terpstra Keyboard and the website will exist.<br/><br/><b>Thank You Postcard</b><br/>We'll send you a personalized, hand written postcard featuring beautiful images with the scale model Siemen Terpstra originally built out of cardboard. On top of that, your name will be published on the forthcoming official homepage.<br/><br/><b>Design Specifications</b><br/>This is a paper written by Siemen Terpstra consisting of 3 pages text, 2 diagrams and 4 color pictures with the cardboard scale model he built. You will receive a copy of it in your physical mail box. The paper is about the motivation behind and specifications of Siemen's design, and it contains one secret - the other half of the story, known only by the owners of this document. Additionally, your name will be published on the forthcoming official homepage.<br/><br/><b>Original Study of Temperaments</b><br/>You'll receive by snail mail a copy of Siemen Terpstra's original study of 80 historic keyboard tunings, titled ""Irregular Temperaments and the Division of the Ditonic Comma"". This paper of 60 pages text and 109 pages with hand drawn diagrams and tables was characterized by Johnny Reinhard as the best paper ever written on temperaments. Besides being a study of a few historical temperaments and many others discovered by Siemen, this paper explains how everyone could devise their own tunings. In order to hear them, any keyboard could theoretically be used. Additionally, your name will be published on the forthcoming official homepage.<br/><br/><b>Upgradeable Terpstra 56</b><br/>Get the one ""octave"" version of the Terpstra Keyboard, that can be upgraded with the color changing keycaps (sold separately). We think this 56 key version is best suited for DJ's, VJ's or anyone that could take advantage mostly of the continuous controllers and RGB LED keycaps on every key. Keep in mind that shipping will be charged separately at the moment of dispatch, and you will have to pay the import charges / customs fees / VAT according to the legislation of your country. The keyboards will be shipped from Toronto, Canada. Your name and website will be published on the forthcoming official homepage, immortalized on the ""About"" section, under the title ""Proud Owners of the First Batch of Prototypes"".<br/><br/><b>Original Terpstra 280</b><br/>Get the full 5 ""octave"" standard version of the Terpstra Keyboard. This is the original, 280 keys version, 12 times easier to learn than the standard piano keyboard for beginners, and the best microtonal tool for advanced users. Although the PCBs are redesigned, the backlighting components are left unpopulated, so this version won't be able to support color changing keys. Keep in mind that shipping will be charged separately at the moment of dispatch, and you will have to pay the import charges / customs fees / VAT according to the legislation of your country. The keyboards will be shipped from Toronto, Canada. Your name and website will be published on the forthcoming official homepage, immortalized on the ""About"" section, under the title ""Proud Owners of the First Batch of Prototypes"".<br/><br/><b>Terpstra 280 &amp; Einklang bundle</b><br/>Get the full 5 ""octave"" version of the Cortex Design Terpstra Keyboard plus Einklang - a synthesizer following a complete new paradigm of sound generation.

 Dylan Horvath:Hey guys! I’m very excited to get working on this project again. I actually came across my original logbook from 2005 that had all of my original development notes in it. I can’t believe how much I pulled off back then; we are in such a better spot now in terms of our ability to pull off a project of this complexity, and the Open Source community has exploded since then as well. Thanks for your support so far and I look forward to talking with all of you more as we move forward!
The History of This Keyboard 
The Terpstra Keyboard began as an American Festival of Microtonal Music production made with initial support from the Maldeb Foundation. It was then supplementally co-funded by Garnet Willis who provided majority prototype development funding through a successful Canada Council arts grant.
The keyboard layout 
follows a design proposed by Siemen Terpstra; all of the detailed 
engineering was done by Dylan Horvath from Cortex Design, in 
collaboration with artistic director Garnet Willis, advisor Joel 
Mandelbaum and executive director Johnny Reinhard of the AFMM.Only two prototypes were ever built and we're raising money to bring this project back to life - improved and packed with amazing new features.



It's Time for Advancement
The 7-white/5-black classical keyboard, together with the tuning system based on 12 equal divisions of the octave became standards after Europe came out of the Middle Ages. Since then, there has been continuous progress and advancement in all areas - except music - where evolution has stalled. But not for everyone.
 

The Terpstra Keyboard represents the apex of musical keyboard development. It integrates all of the major historical breakthroughs in design, since the standardization of the classical piano-style keyboard.
 


Most important, this isomorphic instrument is incredibly easy to learn and play, because any passage, chord, or combination of any kind, has exactly the same form under the fingers in whatever key it is played. If you are new to music theory and don’t know what we’re talking about, think of it this way: if it would take 12 years to learn to play the piano, it will take you just 1 with the Terpstra.
 
- notes an octave apart are always on the same horizontal axis - 
And if 12 notes per octave sounds boring to you, the Terpstra Keyboard has been built with Xen (Microtonality) in mind. It has enough keys to do practically any layout that's ever been advocated.
 







The Vision Behind Funding
The Terpstra has been originally designed as a MIDI controller, with key mechanics capable of unprecedented expressivity. We have decided to redesign the PCBs and upgrade connectivity to USB and wireless OSC (Open Sound Control) in addition to standard MIDI and to add RGB LED keycaps that would change color according to layout changes.Making these a reality would open up the door to many other possibilities. Depending on the on-board computer's DSP capabilities, the controller could generate and send visuals through HDMI output, by creating patterns based on the harmonic relationships between the notes played. Wireless connectivity would allow a hand-held device like a smart-phone or tablet to control the settings on the keyboard by changing tunings, creating presets and even become a real-time synthesizer for the controller.In order to program the Terpstra, we first have to build some prototypes, but they are cost prohibitive to make in a limited quantity. The only way to reduce costs is to build at least 20. This way, people interested in giving us a hand will get a completely functional prototype, though limited regarding extra features, until further development.In other words, help us fund this project and take home one of the available keyboards, at a fraction of the market price. As we continue with development, you will receive free updates that will activate functions like continuous controller keys, OSC, interactive learning games using the RGB LED keycaps or whatever new idea we might come up with - provided the hardware can handle it. You could of course program it based on your specific needs, or join the other campaign supporters to create an open-source software community around the Terpstra. 

 


Still Under Development
You can help not just by funding; you can be part of the brainstorming team and decide together with us which development platform to choose and which features should be implemented.No matter the software improvements we might program in the future, THE TERPSTRA KEYBOARD PROTOTYPE YOU GET BY FUNDING THIS CAMPAIGN IS 100% HARDWARE CAPABLE AND WILL BE ABLE TO SEND MIDI DATA RIGHT FROM THE START. 

THIS MEANS THAT IT CAN BE USED JUST LIKE ANY OTHER CONTROLLER, AND WITH THE HELP OF THIRD PARTY FREE SOFTWARE / HARDWARE (synth, retuning, mapping) IT WILL RUN, ON WHATEVER LAYOUT, IN WHATEVER TONALITY YOU WISH, RIGHT OUT-OF-THE-BOX.

 



What You Get:Detailed Description of the Perks
Your Name on the WebsiteGet your name published on on Terpstra's forthcoming official homepage, immortalized on the ""About"" section, under the title ""The People Who Made This Possible"". This list is going to be kept as long as the Terpstra Keyboard and the website will exist.Thank You PostcardWe'll send you a personalized, hand written postcard featuring beautiful images with the scale model Siemen Terpstra originally built out of cardboard. On top of that, your name will be published on the forthcoming official homepage.Design SpecificationsThis is a paper written by Siemen Terpstra consisting of 3 pages text, 2 diagrams and 4 color pictures with the cardboard scale model he built. You will receive a copy of it in your physical mail box. The paper is about the motivation behind and specifications of Siemen's design, and it contains one secret - the other half of the story, known only by the owners of this document. Additionally, your name will be published on the forthcoming official homepage.Original Study of TemperamentsYou'll receive by snail mail a copy of Siemen Terpstra's original study of 80 historic keyboard tunings, titled ""Irregular Temperaments and the Division of the Ditonic Comma"". This paper of 60 pages text and 109 pages with hand drawn diagrams and tables was characterized by Johnny Reinhard as the best paper ever written on temperaments. Besides being a study of a few historical temperaments and many others discovered by Siemen, this paper explains how everyone could devise their own tunings. In order to hear them, any keyboard could theoretically be used. Additionally, your name will be published on the forthcoming official homepage.Upgradeable Terpstra 56Get the one ""octave"" version of the Terpstra Keyboard, that can be upgraded with the color changing keycaps (sold separately). We think this 56 key version is best suited for DJ's, VJ's or anyone that could take advantage mostly of the continuous controllers and RGB LED keycaps on every key. Keep in mind that shipping will be charged separately at the moment of dispatch, and you will have to pay the import charges / customs fees / VAT according to the legislation of your country. The keyboards will be shipped from Toronto, Canada. Your name and website will be published on the forthcoming official homepage, immortalized on the ""About"" section, under the title ""Proud Owners of the First Batch of Prototypes"".Original Terpstra 280Get the full 5 ""octave"" standard version of the Terpstra Keyboard. This is the original, 280 keys version, 12 times easier to learn than the standard piano keyboard for beginners, and the best microtonal tool for advanced users. Although the PCBs are redesigned, the backlighting components are left unpopulated, so this version won't be able to support color changing keys.

<h2><b>Who we are</b></h2>
<p>Signul is a product of the IoT Design Shop,
a small, diverse and extremely efficient group of engineers in Vancouver that
love making really cool s#&amp;$. We’ve built submarines, mobile Apps, video
games and countless side projects that could be considered on the verge of
insanity. We’ve been completely obsessed with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and
iBeacon technology for the past 6 months. Seriously. It’s all we think about.
Every single product idea we’ve come up with involves BLE, and if for some

<h2><b>Risks and challenges</b></h2>
<p><i>Delivering mobile Apps - low risk<br/></i></p>
<p>The Signul iOS and Android Apps are
available for download today! There are a couple of reasons we decided to
complete and release them early. First, it ensures our pre-production backers
will have a fully functional product when their Signuls arrive. It also gives
us additional time to run the Apps ourselves to make sure we catch any bugs
before the production units hit the street.</p>
<p><i>Delivering hardware - low risk</i></p>
<p>The hardware is complete and has been fully
tested for functionality. We’ve completed an FCC prescan and our contract
manufacturer is waiting for us to push the big red button.</p>
<p><i>Manufacturing tooling - medium risk</i></p>
<p>Our enclosure design is complete, we’ve 3D
printed it and we’re ready to proceed with having the tooling built. We’ve
selected a local partner to machine the tooling for us who is in the process
of checking the model for injection mouldability. The first risk here is that
we will need to iterate our design to make it manufacturable. Another risk is
that having the tooling built will take longer than expected. Either of these
risks could push the delivery date out should a problem arise but neither would
cause the project to fail. Having not been through this process before we
aren’t really sure what to expect! To minimize these risks we’ve consulted with
our partner throughout the design process and are confident that our design can
be manufactured and that we also understand the amount of time it will take to
have the tooling built.</p>
<p><i>Scaling - medium risk</i></p>
<p>What if we sell 1m Signuls on day 1? We’ll
probably throw high fives for a couple of minutes until it sinks in that we
need to deliver that many units in a timely fashion. To minimize risk here
we’ve established plans to manufacture small runs ourselves, larger runs using
local partners and massive runs overseas. We’ve already initiated these
relationships and can activate the best partner to help us deliver Signul. That
being said, I’m sure there are many challenges associated with producing
100,000 units that we haven’t thought of yet.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Our track record with projects like this</b></h2>
<p>Our team has a history of delivering high
profile projects on time. We’ve built man-rated diving suits and rescue
submarines, subsea power and telecommunication systems, social networks and
some of the biggest video game titles in the world. We aren’t saying that
delivering Signul will be easy, but we have a track record of overcoming obstacles
and delivering top-quality work to our customers (in this case, you!).<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Safety statement</b></h2>
<p>Signul uses Bluetooth Low Energy. It is
powered by two AA batteries and transmits about 10% of the power that a
standard WiFi router does. </p>
</div>
<div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2>
<p><span>Q: How will you use the money you raise from this campaign?</span></p>
<p>A: Primarily, we need funding to put our hardware through the regulatory certification process (FCC and CE) and to tool up so we can injection mould super-pro Signul enclosures. Certification is the most important thing since we need this to legally sell Signul. For enclosures, we've put a tonne of work into Signul and have a product that we can demo today. However, our ""maker"" version and what you might want to put in your home or office have been known to differ a bit. Any funds that are raised beyond our $25k goal will be used to accelerate the development of some other awesome stuff we have planned for Signul.</p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Q: What devices are supported?</span></p>
<p>A: The key to device support is Bluetooth 4.0. For iOS this includes iPhone 4s and newer and iPad 3 and newer. For Android we’ve tested Samsung Galaxy S3, S4 and S5, Nexus 4, 5 and 7 (not first gen), HTC One m7 and m8, Moto G and Sony Xperia Z2. Other devices may work, but we haven’t tested all of them. We’ll keep updating our list every time we do.</p>
<br/><p>Q: What is the range of Signul beacons?</p>
<p>A: In ideal conditions a large Signul zone is roughly 30 m in diameter. Signal (not Signul) strength, and thus range, can be affected by obstructions such as walls indoors.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Can I adjust the size of my Signul zone?</p>
<p>A: Yes, you can choose from small, medium and large which range from 1-30 m.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Is Signul secure?</p>
<p>A: Signul beacons transmit a unique ID that the App looks for. This ID is factory locked and can’t be changed by a third party. It’s also not tied back to users in any way so there is no risk of vulnerability through the beacons or hardware. On the system side we’ve done a number of things to make Signul secure. There is no login or collection of personal data and you can only share tasks with people in your immediate proximity. Therefore, there is very limited opportunity for someone to intercept or interfere with your use of Signul.</p>
<br/><p>Q: How is Signul powered?</p>
<p>A: Signul is powered with 2 AA batteries.</p>
<br/><p>Q: How long will the batteries last for?</p>
<p>A: Signul will run on 2 AA batteries for roughly 8 months.</p>
<br/><p>Q: How will we know when the batteries are running low?</p>
<p>A: Signul will deliver a notification via the App when the batteries are running low. The goal is to provide a few weeks worth of notice so you have plenty of time to swap out your batteries.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Are you planning to have a version that is powered with a wall adapter or USB?</p>
<p>A: Not at this time. Being tied to a wire for power takes away from the portability of Signul.</p>
<br/><p>Q: What are the physical dimensions of Signul?</p>
<p>A: Signul beacons are roughly 9 cm in diameter and 2.5 cm in height. They are shaped like a thick pancake.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Is Signul waterproof?</p>
<p>A: No. Signul is designed to be used in dry locations.</p>
<br/><p>Q: How durable is Signul?</p>
<p>A: We’ve done some basic drop testing of our 3D-printed version and so far there has been no mass destruction. More thorough testing will be performed on the production enclosures and the goal is to pass a 1 metre drop test.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Can we get Signul in neutral shades?</p>
<p>A: We have received a lot of feedback about colours and will be making an announcement about this soon. Expect additional options.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Will you have IFTTT functionality?</p>
<p>A: Yes! We’re working out the details now and will be making an announcement soon.</p>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Q: Can more than one person create a reaction using the same Signul beacon?</div>
<div>A: Yes.</div>
<br/><p>Q: Can Signul work with home automation systems?</p>
<p>A: Signul can make web calls, so if your system can receive commands this way then you’re in luck. We’ll be making an announcement about an additional stretch goal that’s related to this very soon.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Do I have to pay for the App as well?</p>
<p>A: Nope, the Apps will be free to download from the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<br/><p>Q: How is this different than using GPS?</p>
<p>A: GPS let’s you create broad geofences to trigger events from. Signul let’s you do this at a much higher resolution. For example, if you’re in an apartment building or office tower GPS will located you in the same place regardless of where you are in the building. And that’s if it works at all since you’re in the air above a city. With Signul you can dial down the size of your Signul zones and have thousands of unique reaction points in the same building. With GPS, you’d be lucky to get a single functional trigger. A Signul beacon can also move around and still trigger reactions, e.g. launch Apps in your car.</p>
<br/><p>Q: What are the benefits of having more than one beacon?</p>
<p>A: Having more than one Signul beacon allows you to create multiple proximity zones to base reactions on. This could mean having one at home, one in your car and one at work, or even one in every room of your house. We know that everyone will use Signul in a slightly different way and have design the product to be flexible enough to support this.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Where will you ship?</p>
<p>A: At this point we have decided to limit our shipping to anywhere on earth, with the exception of embargo zones of course. That being said, we’d love to send one to the ISS. NASA and ESA, we’re sitting around the red phone waiting for your call!</p>
<br/><p>Q: What is used to mount Signul to the wall?</p>
<p>A: Sorry, it’s nothing fancy. Just 3M double-sided tape!</p>
<br/><p>Q: How did the Signul team get started?</p>
<p>A: We work together at the IoT Design Shop, the Internet of Things innovation centre at Finger Food Studios. We are a services company that focuses on developing Bluetooth proximity, indoor location, wearable and remote sensing solutions for our partners and customers. Signul is our first push into the world of consumer electronics.</p>
<br/><p>Q: Where are you based?</p>A: We are based in Vancouver, BC.<br/>

</div></div>","You asked for an IFTTT channel and we're making it happen!That's right. The Signul IFTTT channel is currently in development and will be ready when we ship Signul to our backers. This means you'll be able to add a dash of micro location to your IFTTT recipes. We're thrilled about this for a couple of reasons: it shows that we can work together to make Signul better (this was your idea!) and that the team at IFTTT see the value in our product and have put it up there with other automation products such as Nest, Belkin and Philips. Awesome stuff!!!Check out our new home automation perks!
This is huge for Signul as it truly opens the system up to a world of possibility when it comes to what you can automate based on micro location. At home you can now turn off the heat with your Nest thermostat when you leave the house in the morning, make sure the coffee pot is off with a Belkin WeMo switch and turn your Philips Hue lighting on when you arrive home.
What's IFTTT?IFTTT is a service that lets you create powerful connections with one simple statement:Signul: Simplify your digital lifeSignul is a personal beacon system that simplifies your life by automating everyday activities. Use beacons to create proximity zones in your home, office, car, or really anywhere that you perform repetitive tasks. The Signul App detects these zones and triggers events when you enter or exit them. Here are a few examples of what you can do:

How you use a Signul beacon
Setting up reactions is really easy:






Boom! You've created a brand new Signul zone
that can launch Apps, open websites, send messages, tweet, or post to
Facebook. 

Reactions are based on Signul zone entries
or exits and you can choose to make them active only during certain periods of
time. You can also control whether they fire once, or every time you enter/leave
a Signul zone. 
Signuls can also be used my multiple users. Create your own reactions, share these with others and subscribe to someone else's!


The nitty gritty: what Signul does

Signul works on BLE-enabled iOS and *Android devices. Here are some of the reactions Signul can trigger:

Display an alert message (and share it with other Signul users!)
Launch an App
Open a URL
Start a text message
Start a Tweet
Start a Facebook post
Start an email message
Start a call

A: Nope, the Apps will be free to download from the App Store and Google Play.
Q: How is this different than using GPS?
A: GPS let’s you create broad geofences to trigger events from. Signul let’s you do this at a much higher resolution. For example, if you’re in an apartment building or office tower GPS will located you in the same place regardless of where you are in the building. And that’s if it works at all since you’re in the air above a city. With Signul you can dial down the size of your Signul zones and have thousands of unique reaction points in the same building. With GPS, you’d be lucky to get a single functional trigger. A Signul beacon can also move around and still trigger reactions, e.g. launch Apps in your car.
Q: What are the benefits of having more than one beacon?
A: Having more than one Signul beacon allows you to create multiple proximity zones to base reactions on. This could mean having one at home, one in your car and one at work, or even one in every room of your house. We know that everyone will use Signul in a slightly different way and have design the product to be flexible enough to support this.
Q: Where will you ship?
A: At this point we have decided to limit our shipping to anywhere on earth, with the exception of embargo zones of course. That being said, we’d love to send one to the ISS. NASA and ESA, we’re sitting around the red phone waiting for your call!
Q: What is used to mount Signul to the wall?
A: Sorry, it’s nothing fancy. Just 3M double-sided tape!
Q: How did the Signul team get started?
A: We work together at the IoT Design Shop, the Internet of Things innovation centre at Finger Food Studios. We are a services company that focuses on developing Bluetooth proximity, indoor location, wearable and remote sensing solutions for our partners and customers. Signul is our first push into the world of consumer electronics.
Q: Where are you based?A: We are based in Vancouver, BC.",32.0,1,"1 Campaign

src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p><p>... and here it is on top of a Ground Floor Module.</p><p>The next roof option is our ""Clock Tower (Nightmare)"" themed roof module.</p><p>These modules transform your buildings into a clock tower.  </p><p>However, this is no ordinary clock tower.  At first glance this themed roof module looks like an ordinary clock tower, but on careful inspection several strange and weird elements present themselves.</p><p>Firstly, one of the letters on the clock tower is reversed.  That's weird, right?</p><p>Secondly, you may also notice that unlike a regular clock, this clock has 13 numbers on it - not 12!  </p><p>Everyone knows that the number 13 is a weird number...</p><p>... but that's not all... if you look even further, the 9 and the 6 digits on the clock have been reversed!!</p><p>Why all this weirdness?  Well, when I designed this clock tower roof module, I wanted it to be utilized as either a simple - albeit somewhat weird - clock-tower - OR - something a little bit more sinister.</p><p>The strange elements of this clock tower make it perfect for playing a scenario where your miniatures are stuck inside a dream - or rather a NIGHTMARE!</p><p>Inside this NIGHTMARE theme, things are a little weird, and the letters and numbers signify that things aren't exactly normal. :)</p><p><b>What's really neat about this clock tower module too is that virtually NOBODY notices the fact that the clock has 13 numbers on it even when they're starting right at it, until you point it out!  </b></p><p>It's actually quite fun to see if your friends will notice some of these elements or if they'll play the entire game and not realize it. :)</p><h1>THE WALKWAY</h1><p>In addition to utilizing the different building modules to create numerous building combinations, the addition of a walkway extends the possibilities even further.</p><p>UPDATE: The walkway has been updated.  Here are pictures of the new update:</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy""

walkway, on three different floors (1st / 2nd / 3rd floor), or to use the walkway as a vantage point to see the rest of the terrain.</p><p>The walkway can also be placed on the outer edge of a building to act as a terrace / vantage point that the miniatures can walk out onto without it necessarily acting as a walkway between two buildings.</p><h1>TERRAIN DIMENSIONS AND

</h1><p>Our terrain is made from 3mm MDF and requires assembly as well as painting.</p><p></p></div>","OVERVIEWTabletopGamer.com is proud to announce our very first Kickstarter / IndieGogo campaign!With this campaign we are launching a fully modular Victorian Steampunk tabletop terrain system for 28-32mm tabletop games.Fully Modular Victorian Steampunk Tabletop Terrain We designed this terrain project with the intention of making it fully modular, so that you can use it in a large variety of different scenarios with your favorite tabletop game.STRETCH GOALS We have hit our funding goal! Thank you so much! We are now unlocking some stretch goals. An ""Un-Themed"" version of the Arcanist Laboratory roof which has the same gear/cog design but without the wording ""Arcanist Laboratory"" engraved on the front. This will allow you to have two or three or four or more buildings with this roof next to each other without repeating that wording. So for example, if you had three Arcanist Laboratory buildings side by side to each other, you could have the middle one with the wording, and the other two without the wording.  An ""Un-Themed"" version of the Clock Tower roof which will feature a regular clock with a standard 12 digit dial, instead of the 13 ""Nightmare"" edition, and no ""Clock Tower"" wording below.  A re-design of the floor in the buildings to allow for a stairs accessory to be added which would allow minis to move up/down the floors inside the buildings.     This stretch goal unlocked a re-design of the walkway module to make it more modular allowing it to be stackable and to be used as a one level, two level or any level walkway (simply by stacking more of them on top of each other).Update #21 went into a bit more detail on this, but here are a couple of pictures of the new design: In this first picture the module is shown with two of them stacked on top of each other.Here in this second picture I removed the 2nd module to show what it looks like with just one by itself:  All the floors for the Ground Floor & Middle Modules will now ship with a 1"" grid engraved on them to make it easier to see how far minis can move around on the inside of the buildings.  This stretch goal unlocks an upgrade kit which will allow you to convert either one or both of the side walls of a Ground Floor or Middle Module to an outside wall with windows & doors, or just windows and include an outer decorative overlay that matches the one on the front and back of the buildings.    This stretch goal unlocks an upgrade kit which will add a ""facade"" design to the flat side walls (walls with no doors or windows), which will allow the same outer side wall to be used for both an inner wall between two buildings placed side-by-side, or an outside wall with no windows or doors.For example, if you wanted to set up two buildings with a ""back alley"" between them and the walls of the buildings facing each other to not have any windows at all or no windows on the first few floors, you could use this option.   This stretch goal unlocks a major design upgrade which will make the ground floor and middle floor modules and their walls even more modular, essentially allowing you to build the modules in a way that isn't so permanent, so that you can swap out the front, back and side walls of your modules at will.Of course if you prefer, you will still be able to glue all the walls together if you prefer a more permanent solution, but it will no longer be a requirement. This stretch goal unlocks a new modular design of a Retail Store / Cafe facade for the Ground Floor Module, allowing you to have a storefront, or a row of storefronts on the ground floor.Although it's not the final design yet, here is the latest prototype of this module: The sign above the door and the one that's attached to the edge of the building will be offered in various options like ""Cafe"", ""Tailor"", ""Shoe Store"", ""Butcher"" etc. so that you can have multiple modules like these side by side with various types of stores.The front face of this module can be assembled with the door and large window mirrored as well, so you can have the large window on the right side and the door on the left if you'd like.  This stretch goal unlocks a new Flat Roof with Skylight Module which will have a gable-shaped skylight on top of the roof.  Here are some pictures of the prototype near completion.  The final design might vary slightly.  The skylight combines clear acrylic and MDF to simulate top and side window panels on the skylight which allow you to see through to the module below.  This stretch unlocks a new Front / Back Balcony Module which can be used to add a balcony to the front and/or back of the buildings.  The balcony will be wider than the current side-balconies and will allow you to have the option of having a balcony on the front of your buildings, or the back, or both.   This stretch goal unlocks a new Side Wall Skywalk Balcony accessory which will allow miniatures to travel from one building to another via a skywalk which can be attached to connect two buildings on the upper floors.   This stretch goal unlocks a 12""x12"" modular flooring system for creating streets and waterways on your table.  Here is an early picture of a prototype showing two tiles side by side and a prototype of a hydro-electric power station which will be unlocked in an upcoming stretch goal as well. The tiles are designed to be approx. 1"" in height to expand the amount of possible options available as compared to ""flat"" terrain.One of those options is the ability to create water ways/channels such as the prototype shown in the picture.  Other options include the ability for ""Do-It-Yourself"" enthusiasts to use the terrain tiles to hide wiring, plugs, batteries etc. for LED lighting in the 1"" space beneath the terrain.This fully modular 12inch x 12inch system will make it much easier to setup any size table.  For example, for a 4' x 4' table you'd just order 16 tiles to make a 4x4 grid.  For a 4' x 6' table you'd just order 24 tiles to create a 4x6 grid, etc.The 10K Stretch Goal unlocks the beginnings of this new tile system with a LOT more options and features being unlocked and added soon.  Things like engraved sidewalks, bridges, street lamps, etc. are all possibilities which are being looked at. This stretch goal unlocks the completion of the design of a Hydro-Electric Power Generator station with a water wheel and electric power generator module add-on accessory which will allow you to place a building over top of the water canal from the modular flooring system unlocked at the $10k stretch goal level.The water wheel of the building actually extends down through the floor of the building into the canal below to simulate it really being in the water canal.  The water wheel is a full circle which means it can be spun.Here is a picture of the first prototype of this building design:  This stretch goal unlocked the design of three more angular roof themes:(1) The ""Xavier"" Roof Design (2) ""Hospital"" / ""Asylum"" Roof (3) The ""Blank Canvas"" Roof  This stretch goal unlocked the design of a sidewalk accessory pack which can be used with our Tiled Terrain Flooring System or by itself to add sidewalks around your building. The sidewalks are made up of a few basic pieces. The first pieces is a full length piece which is the exact width of one building (156mm , Approx. 6 inches). You can see here in this next picture on the bottom right. Then going from top left to right we see an inner corner piece, a 1/2 length piece, 1/4 length piece, 1/8 length piece, then on the second row we have a rounded outer corner and a full length piece. Here's what you can do by placing 4 rounded corner pieces and a couple 1/8 length pieces together. Here's how the pieces can be arranged to go around corners of buildings. Obviously the width would be made wider by using wider pieces, but I Just used a 1/2 width piece in the middle here so that it would fit in the picture.   More examples of how they can be used. The full length piece is exactly the width of one building, which is 156mm (Approx 6inches) and 39mm wide (Approx 1.5 inches).The 1/2 width piece is 78mm (Approx 3inches) x 39mm wide (Approx 1.5 inches).The 1/4 width piece is 39mm x 39mm (Approx 1.5 x 1.5 inches).The 1/8 width pieces is 19.5mm x 39mm (Approx 0.75 x 1.5 inches).Both the rounded and regular corner pieces are 39mm x 39mm (Approx 1.5x1.5 inches) This stretch goal unlocks a street lamp accessory pack.  Now that we have streets and sidewalks, we might need some street lamps!It can be dangerous for our miniatures to walk around in the streets after dark with no lights!  Help spread the word about this Kickstarter to help us unlock a street lamp accessory pack.  :)(Note: This will be an accessory made from MDF wood, not one that actually lights up, although we are talking to a potential supplier about creating LED lighting kits for our backers.  If you have an interest in potentially getting an LED kit for your terrain, leave a comment and let us know.) This stretch goal unlocks the design of a card box accessory for storing playing cards such as the Fate Decks used in Malifaux and other miniature games which use cards.More details and prototype designs will be revealed soon.This stretch goal unlocks the design of a modular interior wall system for the buildings.  These will be free-standing walls and walls with doors which players can place inside the buildings to split up the modules into ""rooms"" for games where rooms add to the game play.This stretch goal unlocks the design of a new bridge accessory which will allow miniatures to get across the water canal module from the modular flooring system.A design of the bridge with photos will be made available as soon as the first prototype design is completed.This stretch goal will unlock not one but THREE new items.The first thing will be an external staircase accessory which will allow the setup of a building where the middle door w/2 windows module can be placed on the second floor so that the entrance to the building can be on the 2nd floor, instead of at ground level.  The stairs will look very similar to the internal stairs accessory, except it will be modified to fit the front of a building and made slightly wider as well to look more like an external stair case.The second thing that will be unlocked will be a swimming pool accessory for the flat roof top.  It will basically be an insert that fits in the same roof hole as the skylight accessory.  So you can simply lift the skylight out of there and drop a swimming pool in.  The swimming pool will basically just be an insert that drops the roof floor down a bit, similar to how the waterway works, but not as deep and then you can use paint and ""water works"" techniques to make it look like water.The third thing will be the design of some pool chairs for the rooftop pool.Why would we want a pool on the roof?  The real question is why not? :)We all know that when someone comes over to your house and sees your terrain the first thing they'll say is ""Is that a swimming pool on the roof!?  Awesome!"" :)THIS STRETCH GOAL IS CURRENTLY LOCKED - Help us unlock it by spreading the word about our campaign!THE BUILDINGS - The Modular ElementsUPDATE: Since unlocking many new options, including an even more modular system which now allows you to individually choose each of the four walls and the floor of your modules, we now have many new options which are not show below.We will be updating this page to reflect those options soon, but in the meantime you can see a more up-to-date listing of the different options by visiting our site by clicking here.Each of our buildings are made up of three types of modular elements which stack on top of each other to form a complete building.The three types of elements are:(1) THE GROUND FLOOR MODULE This is the first / ground floor of a building.  Each building you'll use on your tabletop will start with ONE of these ground floor modules, and all of the other modular elements will stack on top of it.(2) THE MIDDLE FLOOR MODULES Each building can be built with any number of middle floor elements (including zero) which stack on top of the ground floor element to form a multi-storey building.If you want a two-storey building you'll use one middle floor module on top of the ground floor module.If you want a three-storey building you'll use two middle floor modules on top of the ground floor module.If you want a four-storey building you'll use three middle floor modules on top of the ground floor module.etc.(3) THE ROOF MODULE Each building will also require ONE roof module to be placed on top of either the ground floor module (in a single-storey building scenario), or on top of all of the middle floor modules that have been stacked on top of each other (in a multi-storey building scenario).ROOF MODULE OPTIONSThe roof modules in our modular system bring the buildings to life with various elements built into them to either act as a strategic setup for miniatures to utilize, such as in the case of our flat roof modules, or as a themed setup, such as in the case of our themed angled roofs.ROOF OPTION #1 - THE FLAT ROOF MODULE  This is the flat roof module. This is the flat roof module shown placed on top of the ground floor module.The flat roof module acts as a simple un-themed roof option which can optionally also be used to allow miniatures to use the roof as a vantage point on top of the building. The optional balcony accessories can also be attached to the flat roof in the middle on one or both sides to form a balcony on the roof.  (Sniper positions? :) )ROOF OPTION #2 - THE ARCANIST LABORATORY ROOF MODULE  This is the Arcanist Laboratory Roof Module... ... and here it is shown on top of a Ground Floor Module.The ""Arcanist Laboratory"" is our first themed roof module.These modules transform your buildings into one or more Arcanist Laboratories and features a two layer steampunk themed gears and cogs design.ROOF OPTION #3 - THE CLOCK TOWER (NIGHTMARE) ROOF MODULE  This is the Clock Tower Roof Module... ... and here it is on top of a Ground Floor Module.The next roof option is our ""Clock Tower (Nightmare)"" themed roof module.These modules transform your buildings into a clock tower.  However, this is no ordinary clock tower.  At first glance this themed roof module looks like an ordinary clock tower, but on careful inspection several strange and weird elements present themselves.Firstly, one of the letters on the clock tower is reversed.  That's weird, right?Secondly, you may also notice that unlike a regular clock, this clock has 13 numbers on it - not 12!  Everyone knows that the number 13 is a weird number...... but that's not all... if you look even further, the 9 and the 6 digits on the clock have been reversed!!Why all this weirdness?  Well, when I designed this clock tower roof module, I wanted it to be utilized as either a simple - albeit somewhat weird - clock-tower - OR - something a little bit more sinister.The strange elements of this clock tower make it perfect for playing a scenario where your miniatures are stuck inside a dream - or rather a NIGHTMARE!Inside this NIGHTMARE theme, things are a little weird, and the letters and numbers signify that things aren't exactly normal. :)What's really neat about this clock tower module too is that virtually NOBODY notices the fact that the clock has 13 numbers on it even when they're starting right at it, until you point it out!  It's actually quite fun to see if your friends will notice some of these elements or if they'll play the entire game and not realize it. :)THE WALKWAYIn addition to utilizing the different building modules to create numerous building combinations, the addition of a walkway extends the possibilities even further.UPDATE: The walkway has been updated.  Here are pictures of the new update: Placing a walkway in between two buildings gives you the ability to expand your scenarios to allow miniatures to walk from one building to another, across the walkway, on three different floors (1st / 2nd / 3rd floor), or to use the walkway as a vantage point to see the rest of the terrain.The walkway can also be placed on the outer edge of a building to act as a terrace / vantage point that the miniatures can walk out onto without it necessarily acting as a walkway between two buildings.TERRAIN DIMENSIONS AND SCALE (NOTE: 32mm Miniatures shown in picture are NOT included in this Kickstarter.  They are just shown for scale purposes only!)The terrain dimensions are as follows:Ground Floor and Middle Modules:
Length: 276mm - (Approx 11 inches)
Width: 156mm - (Approx 6 inches)
Height: 76mm - (Approx 3 Inches)
Angled Roof Modules:
Length: 276mm - (Approx 11 inches)
Width: 156mm - (Approx 6 inches)
Height: 110mm - (Approx 4.5 Inches)
HOW TO PLEDGEIn order to allow you to pledge early we have simplified the pledging options for our backers into the following system.As a backer, you will receive a certain number of CHOICE CREDITS for your pledge.  The number of CHOICE CREDITS offered with each pledge amount is listed in the rewards section on this page.At the end of the Kickstarter funding period, you will be sent a survey which will allow you to choose how you spend your CHOICE CREDITS towards the terrain.The following chart explains how many CHOICE CREDITS are required for each item offered in this campaign.PLEDGE CALCULATOR
 The first version of our PLEDGE CALCULATOR available to help you determine the exact amount of CHOICE CREDITS you'll need to assemble the terrain options you'd like, and then to convert those options into the exact amount you'll need to pledge in CAD.CLICK HERE TO USER OUR CALCULATORPLEDGE CHARTIf you'd prefer not to use the calculator, you can also use this chart to calculate how many CHOICE CREDITS you'll need to get the terrain building combination you'd like to order, and then select the appropriate pledge amount.  If more modules or accessories are added throughout the campaign, this chart will be updated with their choice credit values.  EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS FOR CHOICE CREDITSHere are some example terrain combinations and their respective CHOICE CREDIT values.      PRODUCTION WAVES & SHIPPINGThe production for this campaign will start immediately after the funding period is over and once we have received your survey responses.The terrain will be produced and shipped out in Waves based on the following schedule:
IndieGogo Wave 1 - Production Starts Apr/May/June - Shipping July 2016
IndieGogo Wave 2 - Production Starts July/Aug - Shipping Sept 2016

IndieGogo Wave 3 - TBA (If Required)

Wave 2/3/4 Pledge Rewards will be added once Wave 1 is sold out.This Kickstarter / IndieGogo Campaign ships worldwide.  To keep things simple, we have instituted a flat-fee shipping amount which will be displayed and added to your pledge when you choose your pledge level.WHY YOU WANT TO BACK THIS PROJECT NOWWe highly recommend placing your pledges early to get in the front of the line of our fulfillment queue during the production phase of this Kickstarter / IndieGogo Campaign.Once the campaign funding period is completed, we will be producing and fulfilling orders in waves, starting with orders from those who pledged first, then moving onto those who pledged second and so on.Therefore, the sooner you pledge, the closer you'll be to the front of the line in the queue and the sooner you'll receive your terrain!!!ADEPTICON 2016 SPONSORAlso, for those of you who will be attending AdeptiCon this year, we'd like to announce that we are a proud terrain sponsor of a table in the Malifaux Hall ( Schaumburg Ballroom A&B) of AdeptiCon 2016.If you'd like to see our Victorian Steampunk terrain in action, you can see it at this year's AdeptiCon.
MODULE COMPONENT OPTIONS CHARTSIn addition to the photos above, here is a chart of the Ground / Middle Floor Module and the various different component options that can now be chosen PER module that you choose.Each Ground / Middle Floor Module will consist of a FLOOR + FRONT + BACK + LEFT + RIGHT wall option that you can choose from the options below.This gives you total control over how you want to setup your buildings, and you can also order extra components for any of the walls or floors if you'd like to have options to swap out.

It's time we add to that, and build a landmark, The Gaming Hall of Fame.<br/><br/>Gaming is becoming a major part of our pastime, culture, and future. The museum to commemorate those individuals that raised the bar, players or designers, needs to be a cut above existing Hall of Fame museums. We aim to build a destination that showcases the highlights of the history of game design and the evolution of competitive play in a way that can only be as innovative and unique as games are to other sports and activities.<br/><br/>Some of the most memorable advances in online gaming have come from the communities that love the games, and now, we are asking you to share that same passion to help build this Hall of Fame, and be a permanent part of gaming history by doing so.<br/><br/></p> </div> <div style=""text-align: center;""> <h3>What We Need </h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>Share, Share, Share!</h3>
<p>Potentially the biggest factor in our success will be expanding the reach of our mission to gaming enthusiasts around the world. We totally understand that most people can't afford to contribute right now, but keep us in mind and use our share buttons on this page!</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>$50,000+</h3>
<p>We will continue our efforts to find support for this museum and app and will now be able to afford the hosting to make it available and secure worldwide. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>$250,000+</h3>
<p></p>
<p>If we make it this far, we will have enough to close on the property where the Hall of Fame will be built, AND have our developers working full time to have the GamingHoF app released by 2016. </p>
<h3>$500,000+</h3>
<p>With this much support, we will be eligible for State and Federal Grants, and will seek out the remaining funds from private investors to build the most awesome video game landmark imaginable!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get!</h3>Be sure to check out all of our perks for contributing off to the right, but let's take a second to talk about the featured ones that not only make the biggest difference, but have the coolest rewards!</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

<p>Admit Two! Admission for you and another to the Hall of Fame museum upon the completion, these tickets are <b>good for life!</b> That's right, permanent entrance for you to make as many visits as you'd like. This will not include special events, or inauguration ceremonies, but you will always have access to the museum to see our ever changing exhibits. <b>Bonus:</b> A unique flair for your username on our web application that is only available through this campaign.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>$250</h3>
<p>Have your name engraved in a tile that we call the ""Founder's Walk"" which will be the main entrance of the museum. These are limited, because space is limited. The exact designs won't be finalized until we are further along, but, each name will be very easy to read because anyone claiming this perk is a <b>huge</b> factor in our success.  These will be maintained forever, and you can show off your name when you take your kids or even grandchildren to the museum. <b>Bonus: </b>Everything from the <b>$25</b> perk, as well!</p>
<br/>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact<br/><br/>
</h3>
<p>There are Hall of
Fame museums for multiple aspects of sports, culture, and
entertainment. Gaming, however, is a worldwide phenomenon that has a
playing field that almost everyone in the world has access to. It is
also driven by our rapidly advancing technology and infrastructure of
high speed internet and next generation capabilities developed by
brilliant people, and pushed to the limits by extremely talented
players. We want the museum that celebrates these individuals to
reflect that next generation technology by being something truly
unique that will be a destination for generations to come.<br/><br/>The
cost of building such an extravagant Hall of Fame is estimated at <b>$17
million</b>. We could only dream that enough enthusiastic gamers out
there will contribute all of that. Through a successful campaign, we
will legitimize our cause and be eligible for state and federal
grants, as well as validating private investment to take care of the
rest.<br/><br/>But, that's not all we intend to do!<br/><br/>Imagine
walking into the Gaming Hall of Fame where you will see iconic
avatars from back to your childhood. Around every corner,
commemorations of those individuals who created them, and the elite
players that let their talent shine above the rest. Most games boil
down to numbers, and almost all games that are played competitively
online have ranking systems in place. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our web application pools the data
across all platforms and games to create a cumulative ranking of
players. For instance, if you were to look at two players, each Rank
1 in their respective game, they will be on the same level. If one
was Rank 1 in a second game, on perhaps a different platform, that
player would be a higher rank than the player that is only ranked in
one game.</p>

</div></div>","Our Mission: Every major sport and activity has a Hall of Fame to honor their greatest people, except video games - let's change that!If you've ever experienced the magic of a place like Cooperstown, NY as a baseball fan, then you can appreciate the same spirit being contagious in Seattle when it comes to gaming. It's time we add to that, and build a landmark, The Gaming Hall of Fame.Gaming is becoming a major part of our pastime, culture, and future. The museum to commemorate those individuals that raised the bar, players or designers, needs to be a cut above existing Hall of Fame museums. We aim to build a destination that showcases the highlights of the history of game design and the evolution of competitive play in a way that can only be as innovative and unique as games are to other sports and activities.Some of the most memorable advances in online gaming have come from the communities that love the games, and now, we are asking you to share that same passion to help build this Hall of Fame, and be a permanent part of gaming history by doing so.   What We Need 


Share, Share, Share!
Potentially the biggest factor in our success will be expanding the reach of our mission to gaming enthusiasts around the world. We totally understand that most people can't afford to contribute right now, but keep us in mind and use our share buttons on this page!


$50,000+
We will continue our efforts to find support for this museum and app and will now be able to afford the hosting to make it available and secure worldwide. 

$250,000+

If we make it this far, we will have enough to close on the property where the Hall of Fame will be built, AND have our developers working full time to have the GamingHoF app released by 2016. 
$500,000+
With this much support, we will be eligible for State and Federal Grants, and will seek out the remaining funds from private investors to build the most awesome video game landmark imaginable!


What You Get!Be sure to check out all of our perks for contributing off to the right, but let's take a second to talk about the featured ones that not only make the biggest difference, but have the coolest rewards!
$25 
Admit Two! Admission for you and another to the Hall of Fame museum upon the completion, these tickets are good for life! That's right, permanent entrance for you to make as many visits as you'd like. This will not include special events, or inauguration ceremonies, but you will always have access to the museum to see our ever changing exhibits. Bonus: A unique flair for your username on our web application that is only available through this campaign.
$250
Have your name engraved in a tile that we call the ""Founder's Walk"" which will be the main entrance of the museum. These are limited, because space is limited. The exact designs won't be finalized until we are further along, but, each name will be very easy to read because anyone claiming this perk is a huge factor in our success.  These will be maintained forever, and you can show off your name when you take your kids or even grandchildren to the museum. Bonus: Everything from the $25 perk, as well!

   The Impact

There are Hall of
Fame museums for multiple aspects of sports, culture, and
entertainment. Gaming, however, is a worldwide phenomenon that has a
playing field that almost everyone in the world has access to. It is
also driven by our rapidly advancing technology and infrastructure of
high speed internet and next generation capabilities developed by
brilliant people, and pushed to the limits by extremely talented
players. We want the museum that celebrates these individuals to
reflect that next generation technology by being something truly
unique that will be a destination for generations to come.The
cost of building such an extravagant Hall of Fame is estimated at $17
million. We could only dream that enough enthusiastic gamers out
there will contribute all of that. Through a successful campaign, we
will legitimize our cause and be eligible for state and federal
grants, as well as validating private investment to take care of the
rest.But, that's not all we intend to do!Imagine
walking into the Gaming Hall of Fame where you will see iconic
avatars from back to your childhood. Around every corner,
commemorations of those individuals who created them, and the elite
players that let their talent shine above the rest. Most games boil
down to numbers, and almost all games that are played competitively
online have ranking systems in place. 



Our web application pools the data
across all platforms and games to create a cumulative ranking of
players. For instance, if you were to look at two players, each Rank
1 in their respective game, they will be on the same level. If one
was Rank 1 in a second game, on perhaps a different platform, that
player would be a higher rank than the player that is only ranked in
one game.

over a year. We need the support to secure and finish this

<p>There are 1.3 Billion people without access to electricity and we feel that the largest growing industry on earth, video gaming, could help provide a sustainable means to support rural electrification.  Our only caveats are making sure that our games are fun and our impact network is successful.</p>
<p><b>The Solar Games will contribute 50% of profits to a low interest credit fund for communities without electricity access.  </b>This fund will provide a variety of positive impacts such as creating jobs, technical training for Haitian installers, providing durable solar products, and helping provide a mechanism for gamers and the entertainment industry to create real world change through video games.</p>

<p>The first round of funding pays for $9,250 in software licensing and will allow us to work on our free time to release Solar Games: Battle by April 2014.  If we hit $18,000 we can pay to have a smaller core team release Battle by February 2014.  Stepping up to $32,000 allows us to retain our core staff and release The Solar Games: Battle by December 2013.  Stretch amounts beyond that will add additional features to The Solar Games: Battle and will progressively scale up to the release of The Solar Games: Racing for Haiti by March 2014.  Following The Solar Games: Racing, our next stretch goal will allow us to develop the ground accountability and technical support network with our impact partners in Haiti (Please see our Impact Program section for more details). Further funding allows us to create racing and battle locations from China, Africa, India and the peoples' choice.</p>
<p>Please refer to our Stretch Goals section for more details on what pledges create.  </p>

<b><b>The year is 2033</b>. Global climate change efforts over the past 20 years have failed. The environmental apocalypse has arrived and it is causing strange mutations across planet Earth. The global community has one last hope to save the world. We have created...<b>The Solar Games.</b></b><br/><p></p>
<p></p>

<p>The Solar Games is
a series of mobile games that empowers players to create change in the
world through simply playing a game. 50% of game profits will be contributed to a low
interest microfinance fund that will help rural developing communities get
access to solar electricity. Our partners in Haiti will geotag the solar installations to show players where their gameplay has impacted real lives.</p>
<p>The Solar Games: Battle is the initial release of The Solar Games, which is a Mad Max style solar kart battle game.  Our larger goal is create The Solar Games: Racing, which is a solar kart racing game based on real locations, intially focusing around Haiti.  Through gameplay a player's success will be tracked by competitive leader boards and the real-world impact they create through gameplay and in-game purchases.   </p>
<p><b>To view videos and more information about each individual game, scroll a quarter mile down the page. </b></p>
<p>The Solar Games will release on Android, iOS, PC, Mac, and Linux all of which will be DRM-free.  Additional stretch goals will include console releases for Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network, pending licensing approval.</p>

<p></p></span><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>The majority of our perks are cumulative so you get every perk that comes before your designated funding level.  See our perk descriptions to the right and images at the bottom of our campaign page for more information.</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We have a variety of digital perks as well as some that are handmade by our Haitian artists for The Solar Games.  Supporting our project at these perk levels will directly support the arts in our favorite city: Jacmel, Haiti.  </span></p>
<p><b>The $30 Microwatt Perk</b> includes a bracelet made by Sadras Jean Baptiste from Jacmel, Haiti who is making very well-made bracelets from colorful phone wires, durable strings, and recycled plastics.  This perk is not cumulative.</p>
<p><b>The $750 Gigawatt Perk</b> includes a Haitian Flag painting on canvas with a screen print of The Solar Games logo.  The main painting is done by the artists from FOSAJ, one of the largest art collectives and schools in Haiti with over 1,200 artists.  Also included at this level is a portable 2-watt solar charger for any USB chargeable device.</p>
<p><b>The $2,500 Zettawatt Perk</b> includes a papier-mâché mask made by Vady Confidant, an acclaimed papier-mâché artist and painter from Jacmel, Haiti and a member of FOSAJ. This perk also includes an invite to our launch party in Orlando, FL (travel expenses not included).</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>IMPACT VIDEO COMING SOON! </b>Featuring multiple perspectives on electrification and interviews with some of the pioneers of rural electrification.</p>
<p>Our Impact Program is a coordinated network among the microfinance, solar, and educational organizations primarily in Haiti and America.  The program is meant to address the United Nations' <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-solar-games--2/www.sustainableenergyforall.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.sustainableenergyforall.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sustainable Energy for All Initiative</a> which is focused on bringing energy access to the 1.3 billion people without access to electricity.  Not having electricity leads most families to burn fossil fuels for energy and indoor lighting.  This is not only expensive but it has a large negative health impacts for families.  Over 2 million people die every year from respiratory diseases caused by indoor smoke inhalation. </p>
<p><b>How Does it Work?</b></p>
<p><b>Microfinance Fund: </b>The program works by using game profits as low interest funds for community lenders that work to qualify micro-loans for schools, small businesses, medical clinics, households, and communities without access to electricity.  </p>
<p><b>Accountability:</b>  A monitoring &amp; verification program operated by our partners ensure that the money is being offered at low interest rates for quality equipment as well as a feedback system for solar installers on the ground.  </p>
<p><b>Gameplay Feedback:</b>  The feedback program connects with The Solar Games through geotagged system installations.  The geotagged systems will show players the real impact of their gameplay.  Friends will also see their group impact from gameplay as well.</p>
<p><b>Education &amp; Economic Development: </b> Further technical capacity and sales training sessions will be regularly hosted to ensure our solar installer partners are meeting international electrical codes for safe installations.   </p>
<p><b>Experience:</b>  Aside from our involvement with the United Nations Foundation's Energy Access Practitioners Network, we have worked and consulted with the leaders in the global solar movement and have based our program on the best practices for rural electrification and local economic development.  </p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Pilot Programs</b><br/></p>
<p>Our two pilot locations will include Cameron and Lle a Vache, Haiti.  Both of these communities have no electricity access for a combined population of 25,000 households.  We are working with our Haitian installation partner, Haiti Energie, to integrate The Solar Games Impact Program as a potential financial solution for these communities.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We have built a very strong relationship with Haiti and feel that this program will not only provide jobs for Haitians but it will also provide tech jobs for our team as well as our American solar product manufacturers and partners.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>For more info about our Impact Program, follow the link to our <a href=""http://www.thesolargames.com/index.html#impact_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Impact Page.</a>    </b></span></p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Long Term Goals</b></p>
<p>As we provide more renewable energy solutions a variety of health, poverty, and climate issues will be addressed.  Further, increased energy access leads to telecom access, connectivity, and allows for rural developing communities to access social networks, new technologies, and education and income opportunities.</p>
<p>Once we fine tune our Haiti operation, we plan to replicate our Impact Program in rural China, India, Africa, and other global locations in need of electricity.</p>

<p><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><b>A solar kart battle game incorporating surreal locales, solar physics, a comedic attitude, and a positive social impact through gameplay.</b></b></p>
<p>The first in the series, The Solar Games: Battle is akin to Mario Kart meets Fallout. The game is set after the environmental apocalypse where a global battle series has been established. The heart and soul of the game is to be the last survivor in an epic solar battle royale.  Gameplay is fast and intense but with a dose of humor. Players will be able to battle their friends in multiplayer mode by collecting carbon based power-ups and attacking other players.  Players will also be able to choose comedic backseat driver commentary and select exclusive music tracks to play during the battles.  The initial landscape is based on elements from Haiti, China and other locations planned for the future.</p>
<p>Initially The Solar Games: Battle will have four surreal arenas and a complete solar buggy tier that evolves from a Steam Punk/Mad Max design to a Cyber Punk/Tron solar buggy. </p>
<p><b>Vehicle Upgrades, Carbon Points, and Solar Cash.</b></p>
<p>Through the course of battle victories players will earn Carbon Points. Carbon Points are an in-game currency that players can use to purchase upgrades to new vehicle tiers as well as purchasing powerups before battling.  Players can also purchase or occasionally earn Solar Cash, the second in-game currency. Solar Cash can be spent on the same kart upgrades to receive them faster, pre-purchaseing powerups, and other exclusive in-game content. The purchase of Solar Cash will not create a pay-to-win atmosphere.</p>
<p>Each player will have an in-game garage that will hold all of their karts that are not being used. The garage can be upgraded to store more vehicles.</p>

Players will have the option to submit music on a monthly basis and have the community vote on their favorite submissions. The community chosen works will then be available in The Solar Games marketplace.</p>
<p><b>Comedic commentary tracks </b>are a backseat driver experience where players choose from a variety of comedic characters. Guest comedians and commentators will be available in The Solar Games marketplace. Players will have the option to submit comedic commentaries on a monthly basis and have the community vote on their favorite submissions. The community chosen works will then be available in The Solar Games marketplace.</p>

<p>The game will feature five classes of karts that players can race with and against: buggy, truck, trike, bike and a 2-wheeled futuristic big wheel thingy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Real World Locations</b></p>
<p>The Solar Games: Racing is initially based on Jacmel, Haiti and surrounding areas. We have traveled to Haiti to film and document the look and feel of the landscape and culture. We are now turning this into gameplay experiences for a realistic and unique feel for the player. In the future, we hope to feature more locales such as China, Africa, and India.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Kart Customization and In-Game Currencies</b></p>
<p>Through the course of the game, players will earn Carbon Points that can be spent to upgrade all of the different parts of their kart: solar panels, motors, tires, frames, shells and batteries. Players can also purchase or occasionally earn Solar Cash which can be spent on the same kart upgrades to receive them faster, to purchase cosmetic upgrades to the kart and other exclusive in-game content. The purchase of Solar Cash will not create a pay-to-win atmosphere.</p>
<p>Each player will have an in-game garage that will hold all of their karts and parts that are not being used. The garage can be upgraded to store more karts and parts. Players will also be able to show off their garage to their in-game friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>RACING MODES</b></p>
<p>The Solar Games: Racing will feature several different race modes. Players can race in traditional race modes such as circuit and time trial races. There will also be a unique <b>Pink Slip mode</b>, where players can put their karts or Carbon Points on the line and race in a single, very intense, winner takes all match. <b>League and Alliance play</b> will allow players to be put on to a global ladder and see where they stack up against the best in the world.

as a result of working in Haiti since 2010, learning about the problems that exist, and creating a solution that incorporates gaming, technology, solar
energy solutions, and an awareness of a larger community.  


As a result of our experiences we are
making social impact games for a community of gamers and non-gamers so that they enjoy
the experience and make a real world impact by simply having fun.
This campaign is focused on two fun games and one impact program initially benefiting Haiti.

                                    



There are 1.3 Billion people without access to electricity and we feel that the largest growing industry on earth, video gaming, could help provide a sustainable means to support rural electrification.  Our only caveats are making sure that our games are fun and our impact network is successful.
The Solar Games will contribute 50% of profits to a low interest credit fund for communities without electricity access.  This fund will provide a variety of positive impacts such as creating jobs, technical training for Haitian installers, providing durable solar products, and helping provide a mechanism for gamers and the entertainment industry to create real world change through video games.
As a social enterprise we feel its important to move from traditional donor based models for development and create sustainable revenue structures that allow us to grow as a company and improve peoples' lives at the same time.





The first round of funding pays for $9,250 in software licensing and will allow us to work on our free time to release Solar Games: Battle by April 2014.  If we hit $18,000 we can pay to have a smaller core team release Battle by February 2014.  Stepping up to $32,000 allows us to retain our core staff and release The Solar Games: Battle by December 2013.  Stretch amounts beyond that will add additional features to The Solar Games: Battle and will progressively scale up to the release of The Solar Games: Racing for Haiti by March 2014.  Following The Solar Games: Racing, our next stretch goal will allow us to develop the ground accountability and technical support network with our impact partners in Haiti (Please see our Impact Program section for more details). Further funding allows us to create racing and battle locations from China, Africa, India and the peoples' choice.
Please refer to our Stretch Goals section for more details on what pledges create.  



Indiegogo is the best platform for creative and cause related campaigns.  We feel at home with the Indiegogo community and the flexibility that Indiegogo provides.  We have supporters from China to Haiti so we need an easy platform that can accommodate our international backers.










The year is 2033. Global climate change efforts over the past 20 years have failed. The environmental apocalypse has arrived and it is causing strange mutations across planet Earth. The global community has one last hope to save the world. We have created...The Solar Games.



The Solar Games is
a series of mobile games that empowers players to create change in the
world through simply playing a game. 50% of game profits will be contributed to a low
interest microfinance fund that will help rural developing communities get
access to solar electricity. Our partners in Haiti will geotag the solar installations to show players where their gameplay has impacted real lives.
The Solar Games: Battle is the initial release of The Solar Games, which is a Mad Max style solar kart battle game.  Our larger goal is create The Solar Games: Racing, which is a solar kart racing game based on real locations, intially focusing around Haiti.  Through gameplay a player's success will be tracked by competitive leader boards and the real-world impact they create through gameplay and in-game purchases.   
To view videos and more information about each individual game, scroll a quarter mile down the page. 
The Solar Games will release on Android, iOS, PC, Mac, and Linux all of which will be DRM-free.  Additional stretch goals will include console releases for Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network, pending licensing approval.



Below is a quick snapshot of our Stretch Goals for the campaign.  About a half mile down the page is a detailed description of the first 9 Stretch Goals.  Stretch # 9 begins the Stretch Game, Solar Games: Racing.






The majority of our perks are cumulative so you get every perk that comes before your designated funding level.  See our perk descriptions to the right and images at the bottom of our campaign page for more information.
We have a variety of digital perks as well as some that are handmade by our Haitian artists for The Solar Games.  Supporting our project at these perk levels will directly support the arts in our favorite city: Jacmel, Haiti.  
The $30 Microwatt Perk includes a bracelet made by Sadras Jean Baptiste from Jacmel, Haiti who is making very well-made bracelets from colorful phone wires, durable strings, and recycled plastics.  This perk is not cumulative.
The $750 Gigawatt Perk includes a Haitian Flag painting on canvas with a screen print of The Solar Games logo.  The main painting is done by the artists from FOSAJ, one of the largest art collectives and schools in Haiti with over 1,200 artists.  Also included at this level is a portable 2-watt solar charger for any USB chargeable device.
The $2,500 Zettawatt Perk includes a papier-mâché mask made by Vady Confidant, an acclaimed papier-mâché artist and painter from Jacmel, Haiti and a member of FOSAJ. This perk also includes an invite to our launch party in Orlando, FL (travel expenses not included).





IMPACT VIDEO COMING SOON! Featuring multiple perspectives on electrification and interviews with some of the pioneers of rural electrification.
Our Impact Program is a coordinated network among the microfinance, solar, and educational organizations primarily in Haiti and America.  The program is meant to address the United Nations' Sustainable Energy for All Initiative which is focused on bringing energy access to the 1.3 billion people without access to electricity.  Not having electricity leads most families to burn fossil fuels for energy and indoor lighting.  This is not only expensive but it has a large negative health impacts for families.  Over 2 million people die every year from respiratory diseases caused by indoor smoke inhalation. 
How Does it Work?
Microfinance Fund: The program works by using game profits as low interest funds for community lenders that work to qualify micro-loans for schools, small businesses, medical clinics, households, and communities without access to electricity.  
Accountability:  A monitoring & verification program operated by our partners ensure that the money is being offered at low interest rates for quality equipment as well as a feedback system for solar installers on the ground.  
Gameplay Feedback:  The feedback program connects with The Solar Games through geotagged system installations.  The geotagged systems will show players the real impact of their gameplay.  Friends will also see their group impact from gameplay as well.
Education & Economic Development:  Further technical capacity and sales training sessions will be regularly hosted to ensure our solar installer partners are meeting international electrical codes for safe installations.   
Experience:  Aside from our involvement with the United Nations Foundation's Energy Access Practitioners Network, we have worked and consulted with the leaders in the global solar movement and have based our program on the best practices for rural electrification and local economic development.  
Pilot Programs
Our two pilot locations will include Cameron and Lle a Vache, Haiti.  Both of these communities have no electricity access for a combined population of 25,000 households.  We are working with our Haitian installation partner, Haiti Energie, to integrate The Solar Games Impact Program as a potential financial solution for these communities.
We have built a very strong relationship with Haiti and feel that this program will not only provide jobs for Haitians but it will also provide tech jobs for our team as well as our American solar product manufacturers and partners.
For more info about our Impact Program, follow the link to our Impact Page.    
Long Term Goals
As we provide more renewable energy solutions a variety of health, poverty, and climate issues will be addressed.  Further, increased energy access leads to telecom access, connectivity, and allows for rural developing communities to access social networks, new technologies, and education and income opportunities.
Once we fine tune our Haiti operation, we plan to replicate our Impact Program in rural China, India, Africa, and other global locations in need of electricity.



             









Please consider contributing to our campaign and share our project with your friends and networks.  We are so close to making this dream come true. Your contribution will not only help to great jobs for our team and partners but it will also create a new opportunity and a better life for our global community.
If you cannot contribute financially but want to support our campaign please share our campaign with the available Indiegogo share tools or personally tell someone about the campaign.                                        

                                      
A solar kart battle game incorporating surreal locales, solar physics, a comedic attitude, and a positive social impact through gameplay.
The first in the series, The Solar Games: Battle is akin to Mario Kart meets Fallout. The game is set after the environmental apocalypse where a global battle series has been established. The heart and soul of the game is to be the last survivor in an epic solar battle royale.  Gameplay is fast and intense but with a dose of humor. Players will be able to battle their friends in multiplayer mode by collecting carbon based power-ups and attacking other players.  Players will also be able to choose comedic backseat driver commentary and select exclusive music tracks to play during the battles.  The initial landscape is based on elements from Haiti, China and other locations planned for the future.
Initially The Solar Games: Battle will have four surreal arenas and a complete solar buggy tier that evolves from a Steam Punk/Mad Max design to a Cyber Punk/Tron solar buggy. 
Vehicle Upgrades, Carbon Points, and Solar Cash.
Through the course of battle victories players will earn Carbon Points. Carbon Points are an in-game currency that players can use to purchase upgrades to new vehicle tiers as well as purchasing powerups before battling.  Players can also purchase or occasionally earn Solar Cash, the second in-game currency. Solar Cash can be spent on the same kart upgrades to receive them faster, pre-purchaseing powerups, and other exclusive in-game content. The purchase of Solar Cash will not create a pay-to-win atmosphere.
Each player will have an in-game garage that will hold all of their karts that are not being used. The garage can be upgraded to store more vehicles.




















Player freedom is essential throughout The Solar Games.  In addition to fully customizable karts, players can also customize their audio experience. In-game music will integrate culturally relevant and collaborative music efforts from local artists for each locale.  Players will have the option of streaming music or listening to curated playlists by celebrity artists. Players will have the option to submit music on a monthly basis and have the community vote on their favorite submissions. The community chosen works will then be available in The Solar Games marketplace.
Comedic commentary tracks are a backseat driver experience where players choose from a variety of comedic characters. Guest comedians and commentators will be available in The Solar Games marketplace. Players will have the option to submit comedic commentaries on a monthly basis and have the community vote on their favorite submissions. The community chosen works will then be available in The Solar Games marketplace.
Commentary Introductions








Each player can interact with other players through the World Hub. The world hub will bring players together through Alliances of racers that work together to show off achievements and impact while providing a centralized place to socialize with people from all over the world  This visual network and menu hub will be the main starting point for The Solar Games: Battle and future releases like The Solar Games: Racing.


Below are the Battle Stretch Goals.  If we reach some of our goals we'll continue to show more stretch goals.



                                              
                                                   Battle Stretch Goals
$18,000: Release The Solar Games: Battle by February 2014: If we hit this goal we will be able to release Battle earlier than expected.
$32,000: Early Battle Mode release: This funding level will allow us to be able to obtain our human resource needs and all of the software necessary to release The Solar Games: Battle in December 2013.
$37,000: 12 Additional Powerups + Helmet Content Pack: This funding level will allow for an additional 12 powerups and a 5 helmet content pack.
$39,000: 2 Additional Track Content Pack: This funding level will allow for 2 additional tracks in The Solar Games: Battle.
$49,500: Haiti Recording Session:  This funding level will allow us to take a production crew and one lucky winner to Haiti.  This session will allow us to produce our collaborative music session for the soundtrack to The Solar Games.
$59,500: New Vehicle Tier: This funding level will allow a second set of vehicles to be created for The Solar Games: Battle. This vehicle class may be a bike, trike, truck, or 2-wheeled futuristic big wheel thingy.
$69,500: Pink Slip Mode: This funding level will allow Pink Slip mode to be created. Pink slip mode allows for players to wager Carbon Points. The winner takes all and the loser has to earn back what they lost through gameplay.
$79,500: Stunt Mode: This funding level will allow players to have a stunt mode within battles. Players will be able to earn more Carbon Points or Solar Cash through performing various stunts while in battle.
$94,500: 5 Surreal Events: This funding level will allow us to add 5 surreal events to the game such as: tornados, hurricanes, dinosaurs, goats, acid rain and a variety of other options.
We have more stretch goals planned to create The Solar Games: Racing and we will reveal them as our funding level draws near.
                                            


The Solar Games: Racing is akin to Mario Kart meets Fallout. The game is set after an environmental apocalypse where the global landscape has become a surreal wasteland. Gameplay is fast and intense but with a dose of humor. Players will be able to race in multiple modes, including single player and multiplayer, across realistic tracks based on real world locations. The initial landscape is based on Haiti with more planned for the future.
The game will feature five classes of karts that players can race with and against: buggy, truck, trike, bike and a 2-wheeled futuristic big wheel thingy.

Real World Locations
The Solar Games: Racing is initially based on Jacmel, Haiti and surrounding areas. We have traveled to Haiti to film and document the look and feel of the landscape and culture. We are now turning this into gameplay experiences for a realistic and unique feel for the player. In the future, we hope to feature more locales such as China, Africa, and India.

Kart Customization and In-Game Currencies
Through the course of the game, players will earn Carbon Points that can be spent to upgrade all of the different parts of their kart: solar panels, motors, tires, frames, shells and batteries. Players can also purchase or occasionally earn Solar Cash which can be spent on the same kart upgrades to receive them faster, to purchase cosmetic upgrades to the kart and other exclusive in-game content. The purchase of Solar Cash will not create a pay-to-win atmosphere.
Each player will have an in-game garage that will hold all of their karts and parts that are not being used. The garage can be upgraded to store more karts and parts. Players will also be able to show off their garage to their in-game friends.

RACING MODES
The Solar Games: Racing will feature several different race modes. Players can race in traditional race modes such as circuit and time trial races. There will also be a unique Pink Slip mode, where players can put their karts or Carbon Points on the line and race in a single, very intense, winner takes all match. League and Alliance play will allow players to be put on to a global ladder and see where they stack up against the best in the world. There are also several other modes planned for the future such as Last Man Standing mode, Stunt mode, and Kitty Cat mode.




The majority of our perks are cumulative so you get every perk that comes before your designated funding level.  We strived to create the most value for your Perk, some directly support artists in Haiti as they're making our cool artisan rewards.  So go find one you like!  See our perk descriptions to the right and images at the bottom of our campaign page for more information.

<div>
<font size=""3"">In Nevermind, you play as an employee of the Neurostalgia Institute who is tasked with uncovering the mysteries of trauma patients' memories that even their own minds have </font><font size=""3"">repressed.  The game<span class=""ecxApple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: separate;""> places you in unsettling and, frankly, downright disturbing situations - like any good horror experience. The catch, however, is that you play it while wearing a GARMIN heart-rate sensor. The more scared you get, the harder the game becomes - and, conversely, as you calm down, the game will return to its easier default state.</span></font><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: medium;""> </span>

</ul></div>
</div></span></span></div></div>","Hi, my name is Erin and I'm the Creative Director for the game Nevermind.  Nevermind is a PC biofeedback-enhanced exploration horror game in which you venture into the minds of trauma patients to discover the truth behind their horrific experiences.  It is also my Interactive Media Graduate Thesis project at the University of Southern California and a labor of love for a passionate team of engineers, programmers, actors, writers, filmmakers, composers, and designers.

About the Game

In Nevermind, you play as an employee of the Neurostalgia Institute who is tasked with uncovering the mysteries of trauma patients' memories that even their own minds have repressed.  The game places you in unsettling and, frankly, downright disturbing situations - like any good horror experience. The catch, however, is that you play it while wearing a GARMIN heart-rate sensor. The more scared you get, the harder the game becomes - and, conversely, as you calm down, the game will return to its easier default state. 


So, ultimately, you will have to learn how to recognize and manage your stress levels by playing Nevermind. That is....if you want to see what's behind that next door...
As a game designer and artist who has always had a flair for the macabre, Nevermind is - in many ways - a dream project for me. Not only does it give the team and I an opportunity to play with biofeedback, which is gearing up to be the next frontier in gaming, it also allows us to craft an experience that is both fun and personally rewarding.  By creating a narrative compelling enough that players would want to force themselves into dark and stressful scenarios to see ""what's next,"" and requiring them to temper their subconscious anxiety response in order to do so successfully, Nevermind, in many ways, encourages ""true bravery.""
We think that's pretty neat!

Our Team
The Nevermind team is headed up by myself, Jesse Busch, and Konstantin Brazhnik, who are both producers on the project.  For the past several years, I have worked in the industry as an Artist and Game Designer. I recently had the privilege of being flown to the White House -- where the game our team produced, ""Trainer,"" won two awards in a nation-wide competition initiated by First Lady Michelle Obama and sponsored by institutions such as the USDA, General Electric, and the IGDA.  Currently, I am finishing my MFA at the University of Southern California in the Interactive Media Division of the School of Cinematic Arts, set to graduate in May.The rest of our team is an eclectic, talented mix of artists, engineers, a PhD electrical engineering candidate, a documentary filmmaker, a satellite engineer, actors, a film writer, and several film composers. The wide variety of expertise on our team enriches Nevermind's unique perspective and fosters a fresh and innovative take on the horror genre.

What We Need & What You Get

We want to bring you a game experience that is not only fun and engaging in its own right - but something that will help you (and many others) better manage stress on a moment-to-moment basis in every day life.  We want to release one full level of the game (about an hour's worth of gameplay) in Summer 2012. 


Your contribution will help us reach that goal by enabling us to add final art, music, sensor research/behavior, gameplay testing and refinement to the level.  $2000 will help us achieve the bare minimum of these goals.

If we raise $5000, we will be able to build a fully dynamic music system that adapts to your stress-level in real time.  Nothing like this has ever been done before, so we're really excited about it.  Derek Baird and Jeff Tinsley, the lead Nevermind Composers, are especially excited about designing a sound track that is entirely non-linear and unique for each player, but that plays seamlessly like a film score.



In return for your support, we are offering a slew of incentives ranging from pre-orders of downloadable versions of the game to personalized Creepy Letter drawings, in the style of my Creepy Numbers series, that I will make for every donor of $100, $250, or $500.  Check out a black and white one I did for our producer Konstantin on the left.  For a $250 or $500 donation, I'll watercolor it and even frame it before sending it to you.



Thank you all so much for the support!  We look forward to bringing this unique gaming experience to you this summer!

Hello, I am Jakke Elonen, one of the founders and project lead of Fruitbat Factory. Together with my partners Ozhan Sen and Yoshifumi Ishii we are an independent localization company whose sole goal is to bring great Japanese PC games to English-speaking audiences worldwide.
We released our first game,Yakiniku Banzai’s critically acclaimed strategy game War of the Human Tanks for Windows PCs in September 2012. War of the Human Tanks was named for 4th place in IndieGames' Top 10 Indie Strategy Games of 2012.
Soon after we announced our second project, TORaIKI’s Puzzle RPG 99 Spirits to be released in early 2013. Only a couple of months after its announcement, the project won the election for the Eclectic Indie Dev Grant by a wide margin, showing us that there are many people that want to play this game.
This brings us to the present. We are seeking the support of everyone interested in playing more unique Japanese PC games in English to help fund our current project and ongoing work. 

30% of all the proceeds of a successful campaign will go to the original Japanese developer of the game, TORaIKI.
We are a completely independent company with no external financial backing. We are doing what we love and will continue to do so even if no funding is made available.We have already committed to our entire development expenses through our personal resources and our IndieGogo fundraising is an appeal for you to support our work. Every cent donated here will support our small company, make 99 Spirits the best it can be and help ourselves and the developer release more interesting titles in the near future. 

Released in Japan in August 2012, 99 Spirits is the first RPG produced by the indie game circle TORaIKI, and is currently being localized for English speaking audiences to be released on Windows PC in early 2013. The game features an original battle system where players will have to puzzle out the true identity of the enemy before defeating them. 99 Spirits revolves around the real Japanese legends of Tsukumogami, where everyday objects come alive on their 100th birthday.

- Over 10 hours of playtime in an RPG that mixes intense puzzles with fast paced action- Work out the true identity of your enemies in a unique battle system- Capture enemy spirits and turn them into allies- Interact with over 40 unique characters that impact your journey- Battle over 100 monsters and master a vast variety of skills- Maintain your equipment and combat hunger as you traverse different regions- Beautifully detailed art and an atmospheric original soundtrack bring feudal Japan alive
- Dual audio: Toggle between English and Japanese voice

Click to watch the 99 Spirits English Gameplay Preview video
The player guides Hanabusa on her travels across multiple regions, encountering events and enemies to battle.

The combat revolves around puzzling out the true identity of the Tsukumogami you are fighting - at the beginning of the battle, the enemy's presence is conceaeled and you cannot inflict lasting damage on them. Your actions give you hints towards the essence of the enemy. 

Once the enemy's identity has been correctly identified and revealed, the battle begins in earnest and Hanabusa is able to destroy the enemy - or claim them for her collection.

Keep track of all Tsukumogami you have fought. Capture and train them to use their skills in battle!

Encounter over 40 characters during Hanabusa's travels - some will help you, some will stand in your way. Visit various merchants to stay supplied and in fighting condition!

For a more detailed explanation of the battle mechanics, please see our blog post explaining them.

Hanabusa is a young headstrong girl living in the Heian capital within medieval Japan.  But when her mother is slain by evil spirits, her life turns into one of vengeance as she sets out to hunt and destroy the spirits. 
During Hanabusa’s travels, she meets a white fox who turns out to be a servant of the mountain god. Hanabusa receives a special sword passed down from her mother, which gives her the ability to see the true forms of spirits to help slay them. Shortly after, a spirit claiming to be Hanabusa’s long-lost father, Hidetada, breaks her sword and leaves Hanabusa powerless and confused.
Now to mend her broken sword and learn the truth about her father, Hanabusa embarks on a journey to annihilate every last one of the evil spirits.

You'll receive a copy from a retailer of your choice within our power to arrange, or alternatively a direct download - plus a Steam key if the game is Greenlit.

Simultaneously to the IndieGoGo campaign, we are also launching our efforts on Steam Greenlight to bring 99 Spirits into Steam.
Please vote for us at Steam Greenlight.
Towards that goal, everyone who receives a copy of 99 Spirits from this IndieGoGo project will receive a free Steam key for it once the game is greenlit!

<p>Indie Game Story is all about choices. You start alone with very little money and a crappy computer. You must start freelancing to be able to pay for the bills, and once you ready you can start to fill your office with awesome stuff, hire more employees to help you, manage them, make difficult choices to stay on the track against other competitors (which on phase 2 is against the whole world). Shortly put, it's about optimizing revenue, having a blast while unlocking exciting new objects, new offices to rent and also developing your own indie games! </p>

<p>I've got this question quite a few times, so I'm going to make sure everybody understands why this game exists.</p>
<p><strong>Update! </strong>I just posted on IGS' blog about the whole GameDev* question. Please take a minute and check it out: <a href=""http://indiegamestory.org/post/42284774718/this-needs-clarification"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://indiegamestory.org/post/42284774718/this-needs-clarification</a></p>
<p><strong>This game is not a simple game where you watch your screen while your projects get done</strong>. You have to interact with the game. Your employees have needs. Think about a mix between Theme Hospital, Rollercoaster Tycoon, Prison Architect and The Sims.</p>
<p>You have to actually move your employees around to get stuff done. Move someone to their desk to make him/her work on a project, if tired you have to make sure your employee rests a little, why not buy him something to eat or simply move him/her to the living room to watch tv?</p>
<p>Each employees have needs and if you want them to perform optimally you have to take care of them. There will also be different offices (which you can visit and and rent) with different permanent bonuses, and you will even be able to enhance your current office by buying vendor machines, coffee pots, couches and more! </p>
<p>There is also have random events throughout the game. Employees can get sick, lowering the productivity. Also be sure you have installed an anti-virus and a firewall on your network because you can also get hacked or get viruses which will turn your computers into useless piece of hardware.</p>
<p>But don't worry, the goal here isn't about complicating things but about having fun with a <strong>non-linear gameplay</strong> providing many hours of replayability with <strong>its online features</strong> and its <strong>monthly content updates</strong>.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""How can I learn more about the project?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.indiegamestory.org/learn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<p>There's a very active development blog at <a href=""http://www.indiegamestory.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.indiegamestory.org</a>. I post weekly development updates, and also many other related articles such as my vision for future features, etc. I'm also trying to get a little community around the game on <a href=""http://forums.indiegamestory.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our forums</a>.<a href=""http://indiegamestory.org/community"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Why does the game need funding?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.indiegamestory.org/funding.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As you may have noticed, <strong>the game has a very basic artstyle at the moment</strong>. This is because I draw it all by myself, and I'm way better at programming than drawing hehe!</p>
<p><img alt=""Old Artstyle"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/638115/pictures/full/20130129074631-45646.png?1359474397"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Now I'm right in the middle of development and I need an artist (already found one) to help me finish the game visually which I can't afford by myself at the moment since I'm freelancing development projects to pay for the bills and also for the game development.</p>
<p>So my choices were:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Keep the very basic looking arts and waste many days of work to draw everything by myself. Which would make the game unappealing, would give me less time to polish it and did I tell you that it would be ugly?</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Get enough funds to pay for an artist which would fast forward the game development and get it released in the next months because arts would be made by a profesionnal so I'd have plenty of time to develop and polish the game. It would also look awesome!</p>
<p>The money may serve to get some better music for the game too.</p>
<p>I also would love to buy the Steam Greenlight license now so I could be sure of being able to push it there soon enough.</p>

<p>My name is Tommy Bergeron. I'm 24 years old and I've been a web, mobile and software developer for the last 8 years of my life. About two years ago I started playing with game engines just for fun and I totally fell in love with making games and haven't stopped since then.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this project I never skipped one day, I really want this to work because I consider my ideas and I really believe that once the game's development finished: this game is really going to be awesome! (Even I can't wait to play it!)</p>
<p>Getting it done is the hardest part. It’s easy to get an idea, it’s easy to build a prototype, it’s easy to start development and it’s also easy to draw basic arts. But it’s harder to type thousands of lines of code, draw hundreds of sprites and animations and stay connected with the community all the way up to release.</p>
<p>I love to think about the day my game will be on Steam, I love to dream about people reviewing it, receiving plenty of emails from people, etc. I always think about the people, how happy I will make them if my game is good and fun.</p>
<p>That is why I need you, a bit of your time and your help.</p>

A huge thank you to everyone who helped us spread the word and donated. We really appreciate it a whole lot and we are looking for the future with excitement because of your generosity. Now let's get serious and create a kick-ass game! 
Please follow the game's development on the devblog!

Indie Game Story is all about choices. You start alone with very little money and a crappy computer. You must start freelancing to be able to pay for the bills, and once you ready you can start to fill your office with awesome stuff, hire more employees to help you, manage them, make difficult choices to stay on the track against other competitors (which on phase 2 is against the whole world). Shortly put, it's about optimizing revenue, having a blast while unlocking exciting new objects, new offices to rent and also developing your own indie games!

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>You might not believe it looking at me now but 4 years ago I was a borderline type-2 diabetic, overweight and plagued with illnesses like IBS, anxiety, depression and psoriasis.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>4 years later and thanks to the paleo diet I've cured all of my illnesses, feel great and energetic every day.  My weight is a stable 66kgs (145lbs), Im stronger and fitter now than I've ever been and I never get sick.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I love telling people about the paleo diet, I can talk about it for hours, all the benefits, the easy fat loss, the increased energy and also feeling better about knowing where my food comes from.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But the young people of today need some help, because like us, they are indoctrinated from birth about the evils of meat and saturated fats, and are told by the medical profession, media and their governments that a high fat diet is a bad diet.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There is so much great information out there on paleo blogs and sites but many young people (and even most adults) won't get started because the information overload is just too great.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><font size=""4"">Our goal is to make an Fun, Educational Game That Teaches Young People How To Take Control of Their Health Through the Paleo Diet and Eating Organic, Local Food.</font></p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><font size=""3"">The game will be:</font></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1) really fun to play!</p>
<p>2) Free to download - for maximum exposure</p>
<p>3) available on iPhone, iPad and Mac through the app store</p>
<p>4) shows a cute boy or girl character getting fat, sickly and unhappy when they eat processed food like donuts, pizza, cereal.</p>
<p>5) shows the same character getting slimmer, more healthy and happier when they eat organic natural whole foods like meat, butter, eggs and vegetables.</p>
<p>6) Provide snippets of information at the end of each game such as ""Did you know, there is no proven link between saturated fat and heart disease?"" and then include a link to relevent blogs or research if they wish to read further.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The gameplay style will be similar to popular games like Doodle Jump and Mega Jump.  the player tilts their phone to move left and right - Avoiding bad foods (which slow them down and make them fat) and moving into healthy foods which give them a boost and make them look more healthy.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In December I released a game called ""Rainin Donuts"" which was a subtle dig at the fattening effects of eating donuts, however this game did not take the message far enough, and there was no way for people to follow up.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My plan is to use the base Rainin Donuts gameplay but completley overhaul the game and add:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>* New graphics, characters and food items</p>
<p>* A decision based system - eating good food (meat, butter, vegetables) makes you lean and healthy, eating bad food (pizza, donuts) makes you fat and sickly</p>
<p>* At the end of each game, display various snippets of health information such as ""Did you know there is no link between eating fresh meat and heart disease?""</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This game will be released as a free download because we want as many kids, teens and adults to play it and be introduced to the paleo diet.   Our goal for the game is 250,000 downloads, and with your help this is possible. After the game's release you can send the link to all of your friends and families, people you are about and people who you'd like to help overcome their health issues.</p>

<p><b>We need $7,500 to cover the costs of creating the art and programming of the game.  </b>We are releasing the game as a free download so we are not making any profit on this.  All donations will be paid to the the developers of the game for their time and effort.</p>

<h3>Launch Date - June 2012</h3>

<h3>If your donations exceed our target</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We'll add extra content and gameplay modes.    A few ideas we have are:</p>
<p>* An endless runner style game similar to the popular Canabalt game, and use a caveman or cavewoman as the main character.</p>
<p>* Making the game accessible on Android phones and tablets</p>
<p>* localising the game so people in non-English speaking countries can play</p>
<p>* Supporting the game to be regularly updated with fresh tips and new gameplay modes. </p>
<p>* If we receive over $50,000 we will re-develop the entire game in 3-D with highly animated characters and backgroundsand make it accessible on internet browsers, facebook as well as all of the mobile platforms listed above.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1em;"">A New Magic Cube</span></h3>
<p>Hello. Thank you for viewing. My name is Marion Tzui. I'm a designer at Desert Light Studio. I've designed a new magic cube that I called Luoshu. It is a 26-cubie 3-dimensional puzzle game, no more than 5.7 cm on each side, white, 100% ABS, EN-71 certified. In other words, it's a safe toy/game for gamers age 3 and up.</p>
<p>2-D puzzles are fun. 3-D puzzles are fun and challenging. Defying the traditional one-color and one-pattern design, Luoshu is a multi-colored, multi-patterned magic cube. It makes you think from the basics to the complexity of almost everything, through your hand movement if you are willing to give it a try. </p>
<p>I'm very fond of this game. And I invite you to try it out. Your contribution will not only help the game grow, but also encourage me to distribute affordable cubes and cubing contests to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>And if you are not into cubing and definitely shy from trying it out, you can claim the perk for your child or children who might be willing to play, and the one who are. You can also help spread the word to the folks who might enjoy a brand new cubing experience. Like them, I'll be appreciating it.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>

<p>Cushy is a <strong>turn based</strong>, <strong>online</strong><strong> multiplayer</strong>, <strong>card game/fighting game mashup</strong>. Two players, each controlling a tag-team of cushy combatants, battle it out for ultimate Cushy superiority. The game does not end until one player's combatants have both been humiliated, and taken out with a class-themed finishing move. The last player with a fighter still standing wins.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497930136/zjw1ffjnyebmbdaqduab.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Sam &amp; Brittany battle it out while Jesse &amp; Levi wait in the wings</p>
<p>Combatants are grouped into three archetypes: <strong>AB</strong>, <strong>DL</strong>, and <strong>Caretaker. </strong>Each archetype comes with its own <strong>unique move set</strong>, along with a globally shared set of <strong>Double Trouble</strong> tag-team attacks.</p>
<p>To attack, like inputting a combo in a fighting game, you chain together specific cards from your hand. Cushy combatants use just about every trick in the book to <strong>humiliate and defeat</strong> their opponents.</p>
<p>The game runs using <strong>WebGL 2 </strong>in modern web browsers. This is brand new tech. Firefox and Chrome only added support for it to their browsers in the past few months. I'm pushing the limits as far as they'll go here.</p>
<p>Awesomely, <strong>local to your particular game room</strong>, you'll be able to provide your own art for a selected class! For the duration of that particular game, <strong>you can</strong> <strong>play the game as your own character!</strong> This is <strong>completely different</strong> from the rewards tiers which bake your character directly into the game for everyone to see.<br/> </p>

<p>I'm budgeting <strong>$70 per picture </strong>for this project. My minimal artistic implementation of the game require <strong>8 pieces of art per class</strong> (not including alts, which are generally free).</p>

<p>My stretch goal is to reach <strong>11 pieces of art</strong> (not including alts) per class, which works out to <strong>$9240 total.</strong></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h2>
<p>The answers to some common questions!</p>
<ul><li><strong>Are furries allowed?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Cushy is furry friendly! The game is for the <strong>ENTIRE</strong> community. At least a couple of the core classes with be of the fluffy variety.</p>
<ul><li><strong>How do I contact you?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Top right of the campaign, ""Ask a Question"" or email <strong>drizzleraincloud [at] gmail.com</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>How will you monetize the game?</strong></li></ul>
<p>The game will only cost <strong>$5 </strong>after release. I only care to charge enough to keep the servers running. The only planned pay-for features right now are the ability to fully customize the look and feel of a class with your own custom art, and cushy combatant DLC which will add new fighters to the roster. As long as one player in your game room has purchased the content, everyone has access to it.</p>
<p>Replacing a combatant with your OC is free.</p>
<p>Replacing special attacks and finishers with your own art will be a premium feature.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Balance?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I've built the game from the ground up to be easy to balance, and rebalance. If one strategy is too strong, or another too weak, I am more than equipped to address this without much coding effort on my part.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Will the game support playing offline?</strong></li></ul>
<p>This is an area in which I still have research to do. Theoretically, I could magic something up, but I might be fighting my tech stack the whole way there. Worth mentioning, though, is that I designed my game to be playable with physical game pieces. Depending on the success of Cushy, you may find me selling physical playsets at conventions and online.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Will there be any male Cushy Combatants?</strong></li></ul>
<p>I plan to have at least one male combatant, if not more. I want a mix of genders, though there's likely to be more female fighters than male when all of the classes are done!</p>
<ul><li><strong>Can I use my YCH slot for a licensed character?</strong></li></ul>
<p>Sorry friend, no. I don't want anything in the game that could cause me trouble with the law. Hope you'll understand!</p>

</div></div>","Cushy is a turn based, online multiplayer, card game/fighting game mashup. Two players, each controlling a tag-team of cushy combatants, battle it out for ultimate Cushy superiority. The game does not end until one player's combatants have both been humiliated, and taken out with a class-themed finishing move. The last player with a fighter still standing wins.

Sam & Brittany battle it out while Jesse & Levi wait in the wings
Combatants are grouped into three archetypes: AB, DL, and Caretaker. Each archetype comes with its own unique move set, along with a globally shared set of Double Trouble tag-team attacks.
To attack, like inputting a combo in a fighting game, you chain together specific cards from your hand. Cushy combatants use just about every trick in the book to humiliate and defeat their opponents.
The game runs using WebGL 2 in modern web browsers. This is brand new tech. Firefox and Chrome only added support for it to their browsers in the past few months. I'm pushing the limits as far as they'll go here.
Awesomely, local to your particular game room, you'll be able to provide your own art for a selected class! For the duration of that particular game, you can play the game as your own character! This is completely different from the rewards tiers which bake your character directly into the game for everyone to see.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The night before a business trip overseas, in which I was fortunate enough to bring my best friend (my wife, Rebecca), she told me a story about wanting to help a woman at the checkout of a grocery store by holding her baby while the woman paid her tab.  The woman had three children, two toddlers and the baby she was holding while fumbling with her purse to pay.  My wife wished that she had something on her that could create a connection and give comfort to the woman for offering assistance.  Rebecca continued how cool it would be if this symbol went to Europe with us and was recognized there as well, an icebreaker to meet a new friend from a different culture.  From this experience, the idea of the Meridian and One World Connects was born.  The Meridian being a tradable medallion that acts as a social icebreaker and could have it's whereabouts and legacy followed online.  Our goal is to connect the world!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The next day we spoke about the idea and felt if we started it, we would <b>build giving and do-gooding</b> into our mission.  Immediately we decided to donate part of the proceeds to organizations that help others.  Also, we decided we wanted to be economically sustainable by creating job opportunities where we sell our products (starting in the US).  Finally, we decided we would find creative ways to provide job opportunities to those that have a hard time finding jobs, individuals with disabilities and/or recovering homeless.  That's where this campaign comes in.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We need your support to start our <b>""Do-Good Operations""</b>.  You can help provide scale so that we can place our first order assembling necklaces with the <a href=""http://www.bobbydodd.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""new"" title=""Bobby Dodd Institute"">Bobby Dodd Institute</a> in Atlanta GA.  With just 50 contributors, we can place our first contract with Bobby Dodd to assemble the necklaces that come with your Meridian.  This will establish the feasibility of our plan to provide opportunities for those overcoming employment challenges.           </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>  <img align=""none"" alt=""Meridian on a metal necklace"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://static.worldconnect.me/img/indiegogo/attached_metal.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>     <img align=""none"" alt=""Meridian"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://static.worldconnect.me/img/indiegogo/meridian-coins-500.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>    <img align=""none"" alt=""Suede Necklace"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://static.worldconnect.me/img/indiegogo/suede-tobacco.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>You can help achieve our first test run with the Bobby Dodd Institute.  Hopefully, you'll enjoy your Meridian enough to share this story with friends (it's a great conversation piece) and create more excitement about One World Connects.  This will allow us to continue to utilize the Bobby Dodd Institute for accessory assembly.  Once we really get rolling, we'll find other ways to create more job opportunities at similar facilities/organizations (we've got a ton of ambition and other ideas we'd like to implement).  Our mission is to think creatively about how we operate.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we meet our goal, we'll be able to purchase some metal forming equipment to place at a center and provide more job opportunities building different accessories.  If we exceed our goals, we'll be able to offer new products and find different ways to help disadvantaged employees.  Our next goal is to find ways to utilize individuals from <a href=""http://www.firststepstaffing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""new"" title=""First Step Staffing"">First Step Staffing</a>, a temp-to-hire agency that places transitioning homeless individuals.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Again, 50 supporters (pre-orders if you will) allows us to do our first run with the Bobby Dodd institute.  You will get a Meridian with a necklace that is assembled at the Bobby Dodd Institute.  Also, we'll be pooling 10% of all funds raised to give to a good cause and ask for your input to help decide where the funds should be donated.  Once we reach our first 50 supporters, we'll get some goods shipped out to you (within three weeks of hitting the milestone), as our project isn't dependent on full funding.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you really like our mission, we would greatly appreciate your help to get the word out to Family, Friends, Colleagues and followers.  What's the easiest way to do this?</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
The night before a business trip overseas, in which I was fortunate enough to bring my best friend (my wife, Rebecca), she told me a story about wanting to help a woman at the checkout of a grocery store by holding her baby while the woman paid her tab.  The woman had three children, two toddlers and the baby she was holding while fumbling with her purse to pay.  My wife wished that she had something on her that could create a connection and give comfort to the woman for offering assistance.  Rebecca continued how cool it would be if this symbol went to Europe with us and was recognized there as well, an icebreaker to meet a new friend from a different culture.  From this experience, the idea of the Meridian and One World Connects was born.  The Meridian being a tradable medallion that acts as a social icebreaker and could have it's whereabouts and legacy followed online.  Our goal is to connect the world!

The next day we spoke about the idea and felt if we started it, we would build giving and do-gooding into our mission.  Immediately we decided to donate part of the proceeds to organizations that help others.  Also, we decided we wanted to be economically sustainable by creating job opportunities where we sell our products (starting in the US).  Finally, we decided we would find creative ways to provide job opportunities to those that have a hard time finding jobs, individuals with disabilities and/or recovering homeless.  That's where this campaign comes in.  

We need your support to start our ""Do-Good Operations"".  You can help provide scale so that we can place our first order assembling necklaces with the Bobby Dodd Institute in Atlanta GA.  With just 50 contributors, we can place our first contract with Bobby Dodd to assemble the necklaces that come with your Meridian.  This will establish the feasibility of our plan to provide opportunities for those overcoming employment challenges.           

           

The Impact

You can help achieve our first test run with the Bobby Dodd Institute.  Hopefully, you'll enjoy your Meridian enough to share this story with friends (it's a great conversation piece) and create more excitement about One World Connects.  This will allow us to continue to utilize the Bobby Dodd Institute for accessory assembly.  Once we really get rolling, we'll find other ways to create more job opportunities at similar facilities/organizations (we've got a ton of ambition and other ideas we'd like to implement).  Our mission is to think creatively about how we operate.  

If we meet our goal, we'll be able to purchase some metal forming equipment to place at a center and provide more job opportunities building different accessories.  If we exceed our goals, we'll be able to offer new products and find different ways to help disadvantaged employees.  Our next goal is to find ways to utilize individuals from First Step Staffing, a temp-to-hire agency that places transitioning homeless individuals.


What We Need & What You Get
Again, 50 supporters (pre-orders if you will) allows us to do our first run with the Bobby Dodd institute.  You will get a Meridian with a necklace that is assembled at the Bobby Dodd Institute.  Also, we'll be pooling 10% of all funds raised to give to a good cause and ask for your input to help decide where the funds should be donated.  Once we reach our first 50 supporters, we'll get some goods shipped out to you (within three weeks of hitting the milestone), as our project isn't dependent on full funding.  


Other Ways You Can Help
If you really like our mission, we would greatly appreciate your help to get the word out to Family, Friends, Colleagues and followers.  What's the easiest way to do this?

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Mike. I'm 24 years old and an independent artist who loves to sculpt and animate after work and on weekends. I've always wanted to have my own figurine in a blister package like they have in toy stores. So I've hired some of my friends to help me do it. Jeremy Monz will be doing the Molds and Casting, Randy VanDyke will be professionally painting and Jeff Lafferty has done the artwork for the packages. These guys are all really talented and I'm so glad they are helping me. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This figurine is based on Uncharted hero Nathan Drake and he stands two inches tall with his base. I designed and sculpted him and had my friend Jeremy create the molds and cast me up a few. I then had Randy professionally paint a couple while Jeff was working on the package art. I went ahead and created the vacuforming machine and ""buck"" so I could create the plastic blister shells. Next up was getting Jeff's art and getting the backers printed and made. Finally, after a bunch of trial and error I finally have a complete custom, handmade package with our handcrafted figurines inside. I'm really proud of the end result and I hope you will enjoy the products as well and would consider backing my project to help me fund my next figurine. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These Drake figurines are all INDIE GOGO EXCLUSIVE and will never be available for sale or created after this project ends. I am a fan of Uncharted and this is fan art which I am giving away as perks if you decide to help pay for the materials, labor, shipping and campaign fees that it takes to get one hand made figurine created. It is my hope to use this project as a pitch to perhaps get a fan base built for future figurines, model kits and animations.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will be posting updates frequently detailing the 'making of' process the figurines and packages went through. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please consider supporting us and getting some amazing, high quality perks in return. Please look over the various pledge levels I have put together and if you have any questions or comments I would appreciate them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal with this project is to just get these figurines in your hands so you can see the quality of each one up close and in person. I'm not making any money on this project from the figurines or a majority of the perks. I've already funded the project to this point and now I need your help to make more. I hope that you will see the hard work put into these and might consider pledging a little more than your perk so another figurine could be funded, even if it's just a dollar or two I would appreciate it so much. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size=""3""><strong>The Impact</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font size=""3""></font></strong> </p>
</div><div>
<p>I hope to bring something cool and neat to fans of Uncharted, collectors, toy enthusiasts and lovers of artwork. If the campaign does not get funded, everyone who supported us will still receive their perks. I wanted everything to be created so you would have the opportunity to see what the actual product looks like finished and not some sketches or ideas of what we would like to do. These are the actual products you will receive in the mail if you decide to support the project. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need your support to pay for the materials required to create the figurines and the packages. I have carefully calculated the cost of everything and the prices of each perk reflect this. There are other things like shipping costs, Indie Gogo and PayPal fees that were included. I have went to great lengths to come up with what I believe are awesome perks. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are four versions of the Drake figurine, there's the professionally hand painted Drake painted by master painter Randy VanDyke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mflemjr.com/uploads/4/2/1/6/4216943/1710973_orig.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 347px; height: 447px;""/></p>

<p align=""center""> There's the awesome Glow In The Dark Drake.</p>

<div align=""left""> </div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""> And finally, the unpainted D.I.Y. resin version of Drake that you can paint yourself if you'd like. </p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mflemjr.com/uploads/4/2/1/6/4216943/158889_orig.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 386px; height: 456px;""/></p>
<div align=""left""> </div>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is also a really cool print of Jeff's artwork he did for the project which will be signed by Jeff Lafferty and myself. In addition I will sign every package and thank you card as well as hand number each one up to the number of actual figurines created. Say 20 folks claim a perk with a figurine - I will number each one 1/20, 2/20, 3/20 etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is also a perk level where you can be a part of the team on the next project and help me direct and produce the figurine and even make some money off of each figurine sold when we launch it here on Indie Gogo if you'd like. You also get to pick the topic of the project and help design the figurine!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>YES, you can pledge as many times as you want and receive as many perks as you want. There is no limit to the number of times you can pledge so you can combine the perks you want most and get another one as a great gift idea! </p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center"">- WORLDWIDE SHIPPING INCLUDED ON ALL PERKS -</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center"">Get the Complete set of figurines perk packaged or unpackaged and save upwards of $55.00 </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help me spread the word and link (indiegogo.com/uncharted) for this campaign to your friends, if you don't have the funds to support the project you can still help a ton by just spreading the word and getting more eyes to visit our page. Also, just leaving comments will help our Gogo factor and increase the chances of Indiegogo.com helping us spread the word as well. Hours and hours of work went into making these figurines a reality. Please help anyway you can. </p>

I hope that you will see the hard work put into these and might consider pledging a little more than your perk so another figurine could be funded, even if it's just a dollar or two I would appreciate it so much. 
 
 
The Impact
 

I hope to bring something cool and neat to fans of Uncharted, collectors, toy enthusiasts and lovers of artwork. If the campaign does not get funded, everyone who supported us will still receive their perks. I wanted everything to be created so you would have the opportunity to see what the actual product looks like finished and not some sketches or ideas of what we would like to do. These are the actual products you will receive in the mail if you decide to support the project. 


What We Need & What You Get
I need your support to pay for the materials required to create the figurines and the packages. I have carefully calculated the cost of everything and the prices of each perk reflect this. There are other things like shipping costs, Indie Gogo and PayPal fees that were included. I have went to great lengths to come up with what I believe are awesome perks. 
 
There are four versions of the Drake figurine, there's the professionally hand painted Drake painted by master painter Randy VanDyke.
 

 

 
 There's the awesome Glow In The Dark Drake.
 

 

 
 The Clear cast - see through - Drake
 

 

 
 And finally, the unpainted D.I.Y. resin version of Drake that you can paint yourself if you'd like. 
 

 

 
There is also a really cool print of Jeff's artwork he did for the project which will be signed by Jeff Lafferty and myself. In addition I will sign every package and thank you card as well as hand number each one up to the number of actual figurines created. Say 20 folks claim a perk with a figurine - I will number each one 1/20, 2/20, 3/20 etc.
 
There is also a perk level where you can be a part of the team on the next project and help me direct and produce the figurine and even make some money off of each figurine sold when we launch it here on Indie Gogo if you'd like. You also get to pick the topic of the project and help design the figurine!  
 
YES, you can pledge as many times as you want and receive as many perks as you want. There is no limit to the number of times you can pledge so you can combine the perks you want most and get another one as a great gift idea! 
 
- WORLDWIDE SHIPPING INCLUDED ON ALL PERKS -
 
Get the Complete set of figurines perk packaged or unpackaged and save upwards of $55.00 
 

 

 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Please help me spread the word and link (indiegogo.com/uncharted) for this campaign to your friends, if you don't have the funds to support the project you can still help a ton by just spreading the word and getting more eyes to visit our page. Also, just leaving comments will help our Gogo factor and increase the chances of Indiegogo.com helping us spread the word as well. Hours and hours of work went into making these figurines a reality. Please help anyway you can.

Starship Corporation is a Realtime Strategy Game that contains 4 Elements:


Ship Design


Crew and AI Tactics


Ship Building


and Trade

The player is able to create the layout for Spaceships and Planetary Installations with multiple decks within the boundaries of existing fuselages. He can choose between (currently) 50 Room types in 6 categories . A completed Design can then be challenged by playing a series of missions to test the crews reaction to emergencies and the ships combat capabilities. The success of these missions determines the ships rating, important for a good price on the market or the ships performance in your own fleet.

 

Design Your Own Spaceship
 
Control every aspect of your ships layout on up to 5 decks and over 50 different Rooms in 6 Categories:


Bridge
Emergency Bridge
Engine Room
Computer Core
Power Relay
Armor


Generator Rooms
Airtank
Fueltank
Watertank
Shield Generator


Hangar Bay
Cargo Unit
Emergency Escape Vehicle


Corridor Segments 1-5
L-Section
T-Section
S-Sections
Cross-Sections
Lift
Stairway


Hypersleep Capsules and Living Quarters in 3 sizes for Pilots, Technicians, Medics and Marines


Life Support
Sickbay
Sickbay Extension
Galley


Armory
Cannon
Missile Bay
Missile Control



 

 
 


Hire the best pilots, technicians, soldiers and medics to run your ships, train them and the ships Artificial Intelligence for maximum performance during standard operation, emergencies or hostile encounters – Here are a few example missions:




Technical malfunctions:  Fire, pressure drop, power or engine failure

Medical emergencies:  Radiation or Alien infestation

Emergency Response and Damage Control:  Collision with Asteroids or Magnetic Fields
Defense against Pirate Boarding Parties
Ship to Ship Combat

Boarding of enemy transport or battleships and many more…



 
The better your Ship Design and its AI perform during the training missions, the better their rating will get. A good rating sells at a good price, but also defines the outcome of emergencies encounters of ships in your own fleet, when travelling trough deep space.

 

Build your designs for your own fleet or for a number of clients with different requirents: Shuttles or small Cargo Ships, huge interstellar Transports and Tankers, Battleships of all Sizes, Cruise Ships, Mining Vessels, Mining Colonies, Terraformers, etc. Be the best producer at the lowest price and you will take over the market!

 
 

Buy or sell used (or captured) ships, set up trade routes or supply war parties. (preferably on both sides).

Become a powerful intergalactic corporation profiting from civil war and conflict between planets ruled by religious governments or prosper among the free societies in independent star systems, building gigantic ships with superior technology .

If the crew built the ship with combined resources when the group disbands the ship will be broken apart and each person gets back 90% of the resource he/she invested.

Build the interior. The Commander will be free to put each module wherever he/se wants, but the ships
performance will depend on the strategic placement of the modules and the
placement of the items inside each module. For example: if the engines are in
the back of the ship, but the power source is all the way in the front, the
ship will not reach maximum speed as the engines are not getting enough power
fast enough. Each major module will be </span>upgrade-able provided the necessary research is done.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></span></p><p><span style=""text-align: justify;"">3. Once every necessary module has been placed the Commander will be free to decide
the  position of the

<p></p><p></p></div>","UPDATE 3:Have you ever noticed how they never explain how it it's possible that you see yourself in 3rd person games (unlike real life)?Well, we will!UPDATE 2:Check out the list of features on our website: http://www.the-chosen-game.com/list-of-features.htmlWe will be continuously adding to the list as we decide which features to publish before the release of the game.UPDATE:Robert and I understand you as a passionate gamer would love to see this game become a major funding success, but at the same time you're worried about your investment. We get it because we've been there! This is why we will rush a refund to anyone who requests it in case this amazing project doesn't reach the bare mininum needed to continue production (that's 50,000$). Sounds fair? You bet it is!Have you ever wished you could jump into a sci-fi movie and experience the breathtaking grandeur of the Universe? Or build and pilot your own Battle Cruiser and wage war against a race who use their power to oppress and control others? Or simply cruise among the stars and discover new planets and interesting races? Or build an economic empire centered around your base and control the fate of entire worlds with a simple push of a button? Well, ""The Chosen"" is the answer to all of them.We want to create the most immersive gaming experience you have ever felt. From piloting your ship to walking on a newly discovered planet, you'll be able to do it all.Explore the vast Universe at your own pace. Discover new systems and civilizations. Solve the mysteries of long forgotten places.Forge alliances and wage war for the precious resources found among the stars.Work with your friends to capture enemy ships, and use them to grow your fleet and become the dominant force in the galaxy.Hone your skills in ground combat and diplomacy to evolve into the perfect version of yourself.Help your friends and annihilate your enemies to spread your reputation.Choose your path and shape the Galaxy as you see fit.In one sentence:If Eve Online and Fallout 3 were to have a game child, that would be ""The Chosen"".We need your help to make this game a reality. We are raising funds here, and on our website, where we accept all major credit cards through PayPal.Making a game like this will not be easy or cheap. We need a fair number of people working on it and they need to be paid. We will also need more advanced hardware and we will have to buy or rent (depending on the funds) servers. We will also need to buy modeling software (3DS Max and Maya) and powerful image editing software (Photoshop).By using some pre-made models we can save a lot of time and put more money and effort into creating more complex animations and interactions between the player and the world. As a proof of concept, the above trailer was made with 90% pre-made models in one month by 2 people. So this method is proven to allow us to save time and money while, of course, making sure that the quality does not suffer.The number of missions that will be included in the release of the game will only depend on the funds we raise. The more funds the more missions we can write and code.The funds we receive will determine the number of people that will work on the game and that will set the release date. The more people we have, the faster we can release it.Robert and I understand you as a passionate gamer would love to see this game become a major funding success, but at the same time you're worried about your investment. We get it because we've been there! This is why we will rush a full refund to anyone who requests it in case this amazing project doesn't reach the bare mininum needed to continue production (that's 50,000$). Sounds fair? You bet it is!This game is based on choices. Each Chosen can decided to either be a lone wolf or work with other to achieve goals faster.Once a group of players has decided to form a crew they have to build a base of
operations. If the planet they decided to make their home-world has space ports, they will have the option
to rent a hangar and build their ships and store the resources there. Each base (if built) will be fully customize-able.The player or group will have to gather resources, materials and perform the necessary research to build their
first armors, weapons and ships. This can be achieved in a number of ways:
gather the resources yourself or with the help of your crew, steal them from others or earn
them in missions. They must also make sure that their base is protected while
out on missions, or gathering resources, by upgrading the AI and the security systems.Each ship is built in stages.1. Choose the ship type/hull. In each class, each race will have a few different options each with it's own advantages and disadvantages (go to http://www.the-chosen-game.com/ships.html for more information on each class): Scout Ships (can have only 1 pilot)
Frigates (max 5 crew)
Cruisers (max 10 crew)

Heavy  Cruisers (max 12 crew)
Battle Cruisers (max 15 crew)
Dreadnoughts(max 15 crew)
Capital Ships (max 60 crew).


Cargo Ships (can have only 1 pilot)

Mining Ships (max 5 crew)

Carriers (max 40 crew)

Because of the massive size and weight of the Carriers and Capital Ships they will have to be built in space which means renting a hangar on a space station. They can have fighters bays (need to be built). But the fighters need pilots. The fighters need to be build
separately on the ships by consuming resources, and are customizable  by each pilot, who claims a fighter for him/herself. Because of the large number of crew required for the last 2, they will be rare, but when they do appear they will be able to turn the tide in any battle, so watch out!NOTE: A ships crew does not have to be permanent. If the crew built the ship with combined resources when the group disbands the ship will be broken apart and each person gets back 90% of the resource he/she invested. Alternatively one or more person can choose to buy the others out of the ship when disbanding the crew and keep the ship intact. If the ship was built by a single person then that person retains control of the ship.To assist in ground combat Capital Ships can be equipped with Mech Bays. Once built, the Mechs can be dropped on planets in certain situations to give the team a better chance of success.2. Build the interior. The Commander will be free to put each module wherever he/se wants, but the ships
performance will depend on the strategic placement of the modules and the
placement of the items inside each module. For example: if the engines are in
the back of the ship, but the power source is all the way in the front, the
ship will not reach maximum speed as the engines are not getting enough power
fast enough. Each major module will be upgrade-able provided the necessary research is done.3. Once every necessary module has been placed the Commander will be free to decide
the  position of the
shield emitters. The number and strength of the emitters will be determined by available power.4. After each step has been completed all that remains is to install the AI give
it a name and launch the ship.Each ship (aside from the Scout and Cargo Carrier) can have a full crew compliment: Commander, Pilot, Science Officer, Engineer, Tactical Officer, but each ship can still be used by a single person by building drones and giving the AI control over them to perform the tasks of the missing crew. But due to the limitation of the AIs the drones can only achieve a 60% efficiency in doing the required jobs.Once the ship is built each player has to perform a task while on the ship: 


Captain:
gives
out
the orders and makes the tactical decisions. Must also take into
consideration the recommendations of the crew. The captain is chosen by vote.


Engineer: must keep the ship operational, and makes repairs during battle to the
ship and the crew armors. Can make modifications to the ship while docked at an
appropriate port.


Science Officer: can research new
technologies in ship lab (if built), can build translators for crew and adapt
them to new languages. Without the translators players from different species
can't communicate. 


Tactical Officer: in charge of the ships weapon systems.


Pilot: flies the ship. Logical I think.


Fighter Pilot: only on carriers and capital ships.

Every person (and group) is free to decide what they want to do with their new ship. Do they want to be bandits and cause grief to others? Or maybe they want to join the Peace Keepers and stop pirates for cash rewards. Or maybe take up mining, a
relatively safe and lucrative job. Maybe exploring new worlds and lost stations
looking for new technologies is more your pace? Or maybe you just want to cruise the stars...You are free to choose your own path in the game and they are not
mutually exclusive.The final version of the game will feature 6 playable races:

Human


Aleos


Krey


Arachnids


Lur'eyan


Rok

For a detailed description of each race go to: http://www.the-chosen-game.com/races.htmlWe want to make this game as realistic as possible. So one of the main features will be the ability to walk around in your ship at any time you choose. Just get up from your console and explore your ship. Add new modules and rooms, upgrade and repair systems. Talk to the AI and get more information about the paces you visited or want to visit.You will be able to write a public log once a week and share your experiences with the other pilots. Tell them about exciting new worlds you found or warn them about the dangers you encountered in your travels.If we reach our goal of 1,500,000$ we will add weekly news to the game. In the news broadcast you will be given information about new discoveries and possible mission opportunities, and players will have the opportunity to join the news team and submit stories and videos on major events.Enhance your character with biological and mechanical augmentations. For example: install cybernetic arms to enhance melee damage, or use gene therapy to expand your mind and enhance your research speed.When making contact with a people for the first time you have a choice:1. Befriend the population for various bonuses and/or upgrades - the player
must in turn swear to protect the planet in case it is attacked, failing to do
so will end any agreement with the planet.
2. Enslave the population. This gives the bonuses, but there is a high risk of
revolutions and sabotage to the players ship/s.
3. Remain neutral. No commitment is made and the player will be free to trade
with the planet.Travel through the Nexus and discover new systems. Choose whether or not to reveal the coordinates of these systems to other commanders.The economy of the Galaxy will be driven by player supply and demand. You will be able to sell anything form a single Stim to an entire Capital Ship.~LORE~There will be pages upon pages of lore in the game pertaining to the history of the planets and the different races. But, this information will not be ""pushed"" on the player like in most other games. The player will decided whether or not they wish to explore and discover this information by
themselves.~FLEET~Make peace with other groups and form massive fleets to engage and defeat your enemies.~ADVANCED TACTICS~Ships with a full crew, including support crew, will be able to send boarding parties to enemy ships and either take them over or destroy them from the inside.~KEEPING THINGS INTERESTING~At random times, just like in life, unexpected things will happen and you will have to decide how to deal with each new situation. For example: meteor showers, pirates, supernovas, nebulae that have different effects on ships, ancient security systems, shifting gravity fields, attacks on ground convoys, etc. These events will test your skills and your cunning.~MORE TO COME~These are only a fraction of the features we have planned for this game. We are adding more and more to the list each day and we will also be accepting submissions for new feature ideas once we are funded.~RISKS AND CHALLENGES~The task that we have taken upon ourselves is daunting, so it will take some doing. We are aiming for the best gaming experience we can possibly deliver, and that will depend on the level of funding reached. But no matter what, we will strive to create a game worthy of the trust you have placed in us. Even with the extremely limited budget (less than $1000) and man-power available to us now, we managed to create a cinematic trailer, some concept art and a short demo of the game-play. But this idea can become a truly epic game only with your help and support.Together we can bring the universe of The Chosen to life.Worst case: if we don't reach our funding goal, all the money we do raise will be used to finish the demo, and make as much of the actual game as possible.~Rewards~BASIC PACKYou will receive our eternal thanks, plus 30 days of free gameplay and 3,000 in-game credits ($ 30 value)STARTER PACKYou will receive the perks from the Basic Pack, plus 12,000 in-game credits ($120 value) and a 10 day x2 research and construction boos once the game is out of Beta.EARLY ALPHA PACKYou will receive all the perks from the Basic and Starter Packs, plus the first 50 contributors will receive special Alpha access to the game giving you the chance to directly influence the gameplay.FOUNDER PACKYou will receive all the perks from the Basic, Starter and Early Alpha Packs, plus the opportunity to submit a ship design to be integrated into the game and have a system named after you, plus 20,000 in-game credits  ($200 value), plus a 30 day x2 research and construction boost once the game is out of Beta (stacks with previous perks).VIP FOUNDER PACKYou will receive all previous perks, plus you will be credited in the game as a founder and you will be able to choose one ship featured in the trailer and receive it as a scaled 3D printed model (models available for first 3 Donations), plus 20,000 in-game credits ($200 value), plus 3 months of free gameplay after the game is out of Beta, plus learn the secret to a devastating weapon that can save your ship and your crew in times of peril.EPIC FOUNDER PACKYou will receive all previous perks, plus you will get to work with our concept artist and design a ship which will be made for you and you only.LEGENDARY FOUNDER PACKAll of the previous perks plus you will be immortalized in the game by becoming the founder of one of the largest corporations in the galaxy.

All the 3d models have already been finalized and 3d printed. We are now working on the first master mold to show you the metal casts during the Indiegogo campaign. <br/>Many can testify that any models we have worked in the past have always been top quality casts, and we have produced hundreds of models for other companies in the past. At this stage the only challenge is to ship all the items according to the planned schedule and to unlock enough stretch goals to create the special characters for this team.<br/>

The issue was the delay in delivery of the 3D printer from the factory which took several months more then we where initially told. This issue will not occur again in this campaign as we now have the 3D printer in house and full control of the 3d printing process. All models have been already 3d printed and we are now preparing the molds. ""As before we have partnered with FFfields, a company specialized in custom fantasy football fields. The Ares Demons field will be made available for purchase during the campaign. Note that for this project the fields and miniatures will be shipped separately. Fields will be sent directly from FFfields, so that the production of one item will not slow down the delivery of the other. The Ares Demon field is a stretchgoal that will be unlocked during the campaign- All the models will be cast using very high quality lead free white metal.- Models will be provided un-assembled and unpainted.- These are not toys! They are collectible models and as such are not intended for kids below 14yrs old due to small parts, - Each model will come with a matching 25mm round plastic base.

To better understand the actual size of the miniatures here are other comparison pictures for you:



FF Fields will be making a special field for the Ares in a version that will be only available during the Indiegogo. A one time offer just for this campaign....
The fields and graphics are done by FF Fields. If you are looking for help to make the graphics of your campaign contact FF Fields they can deliver some amazing work as you can see above.More info here: http://www.ff-fields.com/",25.0,0,"6 Campaigns

Tower Enigma is a retro style riddle/puzzle fantasy adventure being developed for Mac, PC, iOs and Android, here you play as Wigo, the orc, whose wife has been kidnapped
and taken up to the skies by a magic dress gifted by a mysterious fairy. As
Wigo saw his wife going up to the skies he went to the tallest building known
in the continent: The Black Tower Enigma.Inside
the Black Tower Enigma Wigo has to solve some riddles and challenges in order to
climb up and find some clues to find his wife.Black
Tower Enigma was made with the intention to create a retro style game that allows
the player to have fun in both the short and long run at the same time that is being
wrapped in an atmosphere of fantasy and adventure.Each
level is a small but elaborated challenge that will make the player use its intelligence
and the ability to decipher the riddles in order to advance through the tower.
Also,
Black Tower Enigma has an interesting background story which is enriched inside
the huge library that is scattered in each level of the tower.
An
orc was chosen as the main character of the story because it breaks the
paradigm of human heroes, besides is a very important element in the story.
Wigo has a big mission in this
story...The
Black Tower Enigma is a huge and mysterious building, also full of secrets, in
each room Wigo will find a lot of objects to interact and that may help or hinder
solving the riddles.
      
      
      

Also,
in each room Wigo will explore a part of the enormous library inside the tower
and will find books whose contents will enrich the story and give information
of great importance.
There
are four different types of books, each with different content:Wigo
can read fragments of each and every one of the books in each level of the
Black Tower Enigma.
Finally
and for the basic game edition there will be a Book System where all the fragments
of the books can be read and also be collected.Without
further ado you can try Black Tower Enigma: there is a demo to play, here are different
ways to try it: PLAY DEMO OLINE DOWNLOAD ANDROID DEMOMy

We want to help our players (and the rest of the Aussie team) get there, so we're running this campaign to help them out!What Do We Want?Vancouver is a long way from Melbourne and we just want to support our players in any way we can! We want to raise enough money to help put a bit of a dint in flight, accommodation and living costs for our players whilst they wear the green and gold. We know we won't get enough to cover everything for all of them, but every little bit helps!What Can We Give You?The quidditch community in Victoria is much the same as quidditch communities all over the world - entirely unique. We've been fortunate enough to have people donate their skills and time to help make up the perks on this campaign!Our badges include a Vic Six design, created especially for this campaign. Badges we've made in the past have looked something like these:SLDixon Photography has created trading cards for our players in the past and has kindly offered his services to create a set of Vic Six cards for our campaign! More examples of his work can be found here, but just so you can see right this minute how brilliant they'll look, here's one with one of the players from Team Australia 2012:And so you can see how incredible the sketches by Kat Art Illustrations of the Vic Six will be, here are some samples of her previous work:

<p>Welcome to our campaign! The ZoomZ team has been working hard to
bring you Second Life’s next addictive breedable.</p>
<p><b>So what is Second Life?</b><br/>
Second Life is a free to join 3D virtual world, where what you do is limited
only by your imagination. Everyday, thousands of people all over the globe log
in to SL to work, learn, create, play, and connect with others. One of the most
popular activities in SL is raising and breeding virtual pets known as
breedables. </p>
<p>Breedables activity has contributed to SL’s multimillion dollar economy, with the thousands of residents in the breedables community working with their pets’ genetics to produce the perfect pals for play or competition against other breeders. Breeders can barter with others to get the pets they want, or even make money selling their breedables at auctions or markets!</p>
<p><b>So what are ZoomZ Breedables?</b></p>
<p>ZoomZ are SL’s newest breedable- virtual cars that you can
breed, drive, and even race! </p>
<p>ZoomZ will have their own “DNA”, allowing you to breed cars that
not only look just like you want them but also produce the best performance
traits such as speed and engine efficiency to give their virtual cars the edge
in racing competitions. </p>
<p>ZoomZ vehicles will be available in various makes and models
that can be bred by working out the genetic traits of breeding combinations - so
far one of our favorite is the monster truck, but you’ll have fun producing
your personal favourite. Each type of car will be able to be bred in a variety
of colors with the details that you want. Chrome, rims, spoilers, detailing,
extra speed-the possibilities are endless! </p>
<p>Zoomz Vehicles, just like real cars, need fuel — vehicles will
be born with one of four engine types — Gas, Electric, Bio-Diesel and Hybrid.
Sure, you can buy fuel and fill up your tank, but, Not only can you breed your
vehicles, but you can produce your own fuel too. Operate an oil drilling
platform; grow corn to produce bio-diesel or harness the power of the sun for
electricity.</p>
<p>After you perfect your car, become a race driver, enter your
vehicle into its racing class and satisfy your need for speed as you compete
with others. Or sit in the stands and place your bets when the engines are started.
When you aren’t racing or having fun breeding, you can even make cash selling
on your vehicles and connect with others at ZoomZ auctions and markets. </p>
<p>ZoomZ aren’t just breedable cars, they’re a product that will
create a global community and generate a huge second party market.</p>
<p><b>So how can you get in on the action?</b></p>
<p>To become part of the ZoomZ community, join us as we work to get
our product off the ground and onto the track. We offer a variety of incentives
to fit everyone’s budget and interest. Car lovers will dig the exclusive art
we’ve commissioned. Breedables enthusiasts will definitely want to check out
our Pit Crew Package that offers an invitation to our beta testing and a
pre-release starter pack. Those curious about Second Life are cordially invited
to our orientations where we give you a taste of all the possibilities this
world has to offer. Everyone who lends a hand will get a virtual high five and
our undying gratitude for helping us turn our dreams into reality. Nothing but
lint in your pocket? Spread the word about ZoomZ in the real and virtual world.</p>
<p><b>What We Need and What We Promise</b></p>
<p>All the cash you donate will be used to create ZoomZ and help us
establish our virtual headquarters.  We need to write the programming to create the breeding aspect of the Zoomz vehicles with their genetic codes, create the performance aspects of the different vehicle types for virtual racing and create the various fuel systems to interact with the vehicular pets.</p>
<p>We have assembled a team of talented
artists, modelers, scripters, animators, and customer service representatives
to turn our dreams into reality. Throughout the campaign, we will regularly
update you on our progress, releasing new art and media as they become
available.</p>
<p><b>A Bit More About the Incentives-</b></p>
<p><b>The
art-</b> We’ve commissioned an artist, Neil Maguire, to produce the conceptual representations from which
the 3D virtual vehicles will be built.  Having
worked with companies like Google, CNN, Nintendo, BBC, Sky and Disney and on TV
shows and Games such as Supernatural, Red Dwarf, Primeval, Sega World Wide
Soccer 2000/2001, Highlander FMV and Constantine (to
name but a few).  You won’t find the art
we’ve got anywhere else.</p>
<p><b>Beta
testing-</b> Every product needs testing. As a ZoomZ beta tester you’ll
learn how our product works before anyone else, and you’ll help us work out the
kinks.</p>
<p><b>Wall of
donators-</b> Be memorialized forever at our in-world store.</p>
<p><b>Pre-release
Starter Pack-</b> Everything you need to breed your own ZoomZ- a male and female
car, and some food to get you started</p>
<p><b>Second
Life orientation-</b> We’ve created a customized orientation to show you new and
exciting ways to experience SL</p>
<p><b>Who are you guys?</b></p>
<p>The ZoomZ team consists of three regular Joes from all over the
world - A college English teacher from Ohio and two working class blue collar guys from London and Philadelphia. </p>
<p>We’re long time Second Life residents who continue to believe in the
potential and beauty of the virtual world, breedable enthusiasts who know the
formula for the perfect breedable, and car enthusiasts who fantasize about
burning rubber on the track. We’re committed to bringing the world the next
best breedable- ZoomZ, breedable, driveable, raceable cars!</p>

We need to raise at least $1500 for a copy of ZBrush and any other various software costs for this game. Although we have a talented team, we are students with just the skills and passion to see this through. We need your help to make this game and achieve the level of craft we want for this game and to do that we need the software to fully bring this game to life.
 
It would be greatly appreciated to see the outcome of young artist as ourselves to be given the tools we need to be a further step to reaching our goal. So please act now and donate to our cause.

<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>We're Edgar Larrazabal and Marlowe Weisman, and our upstart company is Toonup Animation.  Our specialty is family entertainment, and we're seeking your help to complete our first Interactive Storybook App for kids - an enriching and irreverent parable with the temporarily title ""ToonUp Bird App.""<em><br/></em></p>
<p>We've spent almost 20 years each helping to create successful and award-winning cartoons for Nickelodeon, Disney and Warner Bros.  Edgar's been nominated for an Annie Award for directing SpongeBob SquarePants, and has worked on such shows as Rugrats, Hey Arnold! and Futurama. Marlowe was nominated for an Emmy Award for writing Baby Looney Tunes, and has also written for Animaniacs, Disney's Aladdin and the foreign feature Letters From Felix 2.  So we've got a lot of experience in quality family entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE PROJECT AND WHY WE'RE DOING IT</strong></p>
<p>With the explosive popularity of mobile devices, children's storytelling is moving in a fun new direction, with exciting new opportunities to teach some timeless lessons.  This inspired us to create our own Interactive Storybook App, and we've turned to Indiegogo to seek out the resources to make it happen.</p>
<p class=""Standard""><em>The ToonUp Bird App</em> is an Interactive Storybook App that builds character in young readers with zany <em>feather-centric</em> parables.  Through enchanting graphics, an irreverent story and compulsively playable puzzles and games, the app tests children's values while rewarding their better judgment.  </p>
<p>The Bird App<em> </em>was motivated by ToonUp's desire to help foster good values in young children.  This App brings timeless stories to life in a fresh new format, helping children make the right choices - all by themselves - from a very young age.  We think that ‘The Tower Of Babel’ is the perfect story to start with.  Our goal is to publish it for Apple mobile devices (including iPad and iPhone) on iTunes, and Android devices (including Kindle Fire, Motorola Droid and Samsung Galaxy) on the Android Market.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">ToonUp's goal is to eventually be a full-service animation studio dedicated to creating original family entertainment for TV, DVD, Mobile and Streaming.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>Our storybook app is more than the story and designs we've created in our spare time.  It's also the sound effects, animation and (the costliest element) the complex engineering: all the other professional (and time-consuming) elements necessary to bring this entertaining app to life.</p>
<p>Your contribution through Indie-GoGo will take us to the next step: financing the expertise required to finish the app and help us make our dream project a reality.</p>
<p>By reaching our fundraising goal, we'll be able to complete the app and get it out there for kids to learn from - and enjoy.  Meeting our fundraising goal will allow us to get the first story onto the market.  Should we surpass our goal, we'll have a head start in creating many more worthwhile stories to upload to the ToonUp Bird App.</p>
<p>And what’s great about making a donation is that you get something in return.  As our way of saying thanks, we’ve come up with some great gifts that you can check out on our Perks Page, including character clothing, signed original artwork, and (at a certain donation level) a producer's credit on the app itself.</p>
<p>Every contribution makes a difference.  Today's digital technology makes it so easy to reach out and enhance kids' lives on our own - without publishers or studios.  Our <em>Interactive Storybook App</em> will do just that - and your contribution makes you a part of this exciting endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP  OUR BIRD APP</strong><strong>  FLY</strong></p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute, you can help us a lot by spreading the word about the ToonUp Bird App by using the Indiegogo Share Tools!</p>

<h1>Fractured
Realms is
a 3D Free To Play MMORPG with a focus on crafting, and economics.</h1>
<p>
Inspired
by the likes of Ultima Online, Eve Online, and World of Warcraft
Fractured Realms will bring back elements of true MMORPG Gaming. We aim to bring back things which many of us have been missing for years such as Player
Owned Housing, Player Owned Land, Player Owned Shops, Real PvP, PvE,
Rares Dealing, Sand Box Style Skill Variety and much more.</p>
<p>
Though
Free To Play, Fractured Realms will be financially supported by means
of a Land Ownership where players will be able to purchase Land for a price of $50 per each Parcel (No Limit As Of Yet), and
upgrade packages and items from our site. These parcels of land will
be used by players to build their houses, stores, or whatever they
want to build which they will decorate with items they craft
themselves. If a player ever decides to leave Fractured Realms, they
will be able to sell their Estates (LAND) through our Land Auction
Service (LAS) of which we will take 10% of the final sale to transfer
ownership rights to another player.</p>

<h1>
F.A.Q</h1>
<p><b>What
is Fractured Realms?</b></p>
<p>Fractured
Realms is a crafting focused, free to play MMORPG where every item in
the world is crafted by a player. Monsters won’t drop swords, gold
pieces or armor, but when harvested after a kill, they will drop
materials used in crafting items, weapons, armor and the like.</p>
<p><b>Can
I purchase more than one parcel of land to build a bigger house?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely,
you can purchase as much land as you can afford to buy. (No Limit)</p>
<p><b>Can
I decorate my house any way I like?</b></p>
<p>Of
course! If you can craft it, you can place it in your house..</p>
<p><b>What’s
to stop people who aren’t even interested in playing Fractured
Realms from buying parcels of land just to flip them later?</b></p>
<p>Nothing.
We expect it to happen as land will be in limited supply and highly
sought after, especially after launch. However, it will balance out
eventually once the land speculation and wind down.</p>
<p><b>Will
there be upkeep costs on my house?</b></p>
<p>No
upkeep costs are planned for Fractured Realms be it real money or
game currency. We are expecting our commission on Land Auctions and
package and item sales should keep us funded enough for future
development. The purchase of vacant parcels are just paying for the
development of the game and the reselling of Land is what will be
helping with future additions.</p>
<p><b>What
do NPC's do in Fractured Realms?</b></p>
<p>NPC’s
will begin to be placed in player villages and cities as they are
built. Some will tell you stories others will give you quest that
lead you to possible rare materials and adventure.</p>
<p><b>Does
the game begin with any buildings?</b></p>
<p>A Few.
Day one launch there will be a few buildings. As towns, cities begin to
take shape, it will be because you, the players built them so build, build, build.</p>
<p><b>Will
there be PVP?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
there will be zones that are completely open for PVP though only in
such zones will people be free to attack other players. These zones
however will also be rich with rare mobs and materials, so we
expect competition in these areas to be quite heavy. The other way to
PvP is to enable your PvP flag, then and only then you can PvP any
other player that is PvP flagged anywhere in the Fractured Realms
word.</p>
<p><b>What
if I own land that animals, monsters or harvest-able plant life spawn
on?</b></p>
<p>You
have two options. Either one, you can charge a fee for people to
be able to access your land and what’s on it or you can keep it all
to yourself ie make a fence.</p>
<p><b>What
happens if the world gets full of players houses?</b></p>
<p>We
have no limit on what you can build on the land, but we will have
areas that you can not build on. If we need more land we will make
more land, we have plans to be one of the largest MMORPG's of all
time, land will not be an issue.</p>
<p><b>Will
there be levels? Skills?</b></p>
<p>There
will be levels in Fractured Realms, but there will also be skills, lots of skills. We will be adding skills like Eve Online. There
will be caps on skills but once maxed out, you will be able to
de-level skills you no longer need while leveling new ones that you
do!</p>
<p><b>What
kind of Chat System will Fractured Realms have?</b></p>
<p>We
feel strongly that MMORPG games of today have Way to much chat in them...lol Each area that needs a chat will have one,
When you enter an auction house, you will see an auction chat, and
any other chat you will have to be in range of the person you want to
chat with. As in real life this is an RPG there will be no PM, you
will have to be within range.</p>
<p><b>So,
is Fractured Realms like any other game?</b></p>
<p>All we can say is NO....</p>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Sir Sadim here.</p>
<p>After years of genius plotting, I have finally found my brother, Mister Midas, and have enacted my plan to ruin his life, as well as his little Dota 2 tournament. Step one, of course, was to empty his exceedingly vast bank accounts and take over his owned properties. Which has, to my surprise, put me in direct ownership of the Dota 2 map itself. </p>
<p>Unlike my idiot brother, I don’t give a damn about your disgusting game, and so the time has come to do what any good business man does when he commits to a hostile takeover: TIME FOR LIQUIDATION!</p>
<p>That’s right, everything on the Dota 2 map must go. EVERYTHING IS FOR SALE!</p>
<p>Maut, who has recently taken over as my personal butler, will explain the finer details below. GOOD DAY!</p>

Sir Sadim here.
After years of genius plotting, I have finally found my brother, Mister Midas, and have enacted my plan to ruin his life, as well as his little Dota 2 tournament. Step one, of course, was to empty his exceedingly vast bank accounts and take over his owned properties. Which has, to my surprise, put me in direct ownership of the Dota 2 map itself. 
Unlike my idiot brother, I don’t give a damn about your disgusting game, and so the time has come to do what any good business man does when he commits to a hostile takeover: TIME FOR LIQUIDATION!
That’s right, everything on the Dota 2 map must go. EVERYTHING IS FOR SALE!
Maut, who has recently taken over as my personal butler, will explain the finer details below. GOOD DAY!

Information
Betway Midas Mode 2 takes place on September 24 - October 2, with a total prizepool of $150,000. The pro-players will be playing online, but there will be a live audience in Denver, Colorado. You can find more detailed information regarding the tournament format, venue & tickets at http://midasmode.com
Everything you purchase will be viewable for the duration of the tournament. Some perks require you to contact us to determine specifics regarding your selection. Everything is on a first-come first-serve basis. Keep in mind, requests need to be reviewed. We will NOT accept anything obscene, racist, or questionable in any way.  We may also deny requests that are just not feasible to do in our allotted time-frame (ie. no full remodels, custom hero animations, or dynamic changes that would significantly impact silhouette recognition for players). We reserve the right to tweak images sent in order for them to translate better to the Dota 2 map. We also reserve the right to deny any request. However, if a request is denied, you will be refunded. In addition to this, we will not be accepting submissions, be them from companies or people, that conflict with Betway Midas Mode 2's official sponsors.
For all contact related inquiries, please use the ""Ask a Question"" link at the top of the page.
Now let’s talk about all the perks:

Bug Fables is an Adventure RPG following Vi, Kabbu, and Leif as they search Bugaria for The Everlasting Sapling, a treasure said to grant immortality.
You can get a taste of what's in store by downloading and playing the free demo here, which covers the prologue of the game - alongside a few extra side quests!
With your help in backing this campaign, we will be able to create an even bigger game than the demo!
Bug Fables is planned to feature:
- 6 chapters of story following the heroes across Bugaria!
- Many unique areas, including: The Ant Kingdom, the treacherous Snakemouth Den, the picturesque Golden Hills, The Lost Sands, and Bee's home, the Bee Kingdom!
- A vast overworld that transitions into turn-based combat! Use Bee's Beemerang, Moth's ice magic, or Beetle's horn to defend yourself from foes!
- Action commands which can make attacks more effective, or block enemy attacks!
- A cooking system to turn ingredients into items that can help you in battle!
- A tattle system that lets you hear your party interact with each other as they discover all the secrets Bugaria has in store!
 Hidden within the foliage of nature, lies a small but prosperous continent - Bugaria. Insects from all over the world travel to it in search of the treasure scattered across it. The most sought after of these relics is The Everlasting Sapling! Eating just one of its leaves can grant even immortality!In search of this ancient artifact, a brave team of explorers - Vi, Kabbu, and Leif - will travel across many different environments. Including:
The Ant Kingdom: Standing at the center of it all, this powerful kingdom connects all other areas!
Snakemouth Den: A dangerous cave where many explorers have been lost to a wicked beast.
Golden Hills: An incredibly booming farmer area with very respected culture and folklore. Its perpetual autumn is a big draw for tourists.
The Lost Sands: A vast desert home to an oasis, bandits...and a place lost to time!?...and many more!
In Bug Fables, you will command an Ant Queen approved exploration team! Even though its members clash at times, they work together to clear puzzles, defeat strong enemies and help the general bug populace! 

""Look, I'm worth like four bees, alright!?""
Vi comes from the hive resting at the top of the largest tree in Bugaria - the Bee Kingdom. Easy to anger, and quick to jump at the chance for riches, Vi is a crafty, sassy, talented explorer! She can use her Beemerang to reach items out of reach, or hit switches!

""I have a promise I must fulfill. And so, I wish to explore.""
Kabbu comes from the Northern Continent, neighbouring Bugaria. Drawn by the grandiose legends of the land, Kabbu seeks to unearth every artifact - and make sure none go missing looking for them again. Level headed, altruistic and a bit self-conscious, Kabbu looks out for his team the most. With his Horn, he can cut down bushes or push rocks to open a path!

""Even if they seem like obstacles, we can exploit them for our own benefit.""
Leif is a resident of the Ant Kingdom, who met up with Vi and Kabbu during their expedition in Snakemouth Den. Confident and unfazed by almost anything (except delicious food and cute things). Leif doesn't have much to say, but makes sure to do the job efficiently. With the Freeze ability, Leif can encase water or enemies in blocks of ice! Push them around to reach new heights! (Or just freeze that enemy you don't wish to fight!)

 

 
Bug Fables features team based, turn based combat with a few twists!​


Action Commands: Attacks can be made more effective by performing action commands correctly! You can also block enemy attacks!


Weakness System: Each of your party members is more effective against certain enemies. Carefully plan your moves to finish battles quickly!

Turn Relay: Pass turns along teammates to exploit enemy weaknesses!

Front Bonus: The bug in front will get +1 attack, but will be focused more often by enemies!

Medal System: Equipments obtained while exploring can unlock extra skills, change stats, and even make the game more difficult!

<p>Events of the game describe
a year 2027, when the fallen asteroid brought an alien parasite spores
on Earth. Spores, when they get inside a living creature, cause an irreversible
mutation, that brings to life a new race – Malorg (<span>mutagenic alien organism</span>). Infection has spread so fast, that just after a year of its beginning the most part of the
planet was populated with mutants. The future of humankind was doomed, till the
moment when an independent scientist, professor Isaac Mason created an effective
antidote against mutagenic mechanism of spores.</p>
<p>It seemed that the goal is
near: it’s necessary to bring the example of antidote to a military base «Red Heath»,
where it will be possible to produce it in a mass way and spread it among
population. However, there is a problem, lately the connection with the base
was lost. What’s the reason? It seems that the answer could be found only
through the visiting of it. So, there is no choice, and professor Isaac Mason
with his assistant Melanie Becker decides to go there through the risk and
fear.</p>
<p>This dangerous journey has low
chances for success, the path lies through hundreds of miles full of mutants,
and the mobile helicopter of the scientist that was downed by the members of
“Marshtower’s Dogs”, had to go on an emergency landing, near the small town.</p>

Fortunately,
on their way, Isaac and Melanie meet three survivors, to reach already common
purpose.<p></p>

<p>In «Red Heath»
a player has to command five characters in a turn mode, which need to pass 60
locations, connected to a story line, fighting mutants and armed gangs. The
goal of each level is to destroy all enemies, or to bring every character to a
check point.</p>
<p>Every turn
of a character is limited, and this limit is shown as action points, which a
player can spend on a movement, weapon change, action or unique action.</p>
<p>During the
game characters get experience points for their every successful action, what
leads to rising of a character’s level and a possibility to upgrade skills and
to get special skills in a skill tree.</p>
<p>Special

<p>One year ago we tried making a huge MMO. The funding campaign never raised enough money to begin the project. I learned from that loss and spent a year improving the methods I used. I decided that I would build the core game alone, and only when it was functional would I attempt another project</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Unusual thing about this project is that it is a<em><strong> Working Prototype</strong></em>! The world is available to play and explore in as we continue to build it. I spent 6 weeks writing code every waking minute to make that happen. You can create a character, participate in Spell combat and earn experience towards higher levels in two different game environments.</p>
<p>The game can be played as we develop it here:</p>

<p> </p></div>","INTRO:
One year ago we tried making a huge MMO. The funding campaign never raised enough money to begin the project. I learned from that loss and spent a year improving the methods I used. I decided that I would build the core game alone, and only when it was functional would I attempt another project
 
The Unusual thing about this project is that it is a Working Prototype! The world is available to play and explore in as we continue to build it. I spent 6 weeks writing code every waking minute to make that happen. You can create a character, participate in Spell combat and earn experience towards higher levels in two different game environments.
The game can be played as we develop it here:

The Technology:
Rogue UnderWorld uses the following technology. It is Fully Functional with all these packages:

Unity
Vostopia
Playtomic
Photon Cloud
Roar Engine
THE CONCEPT:
I wanted a SteamPunk world that was either Multi-Player or a Casual MMO. I love the idea of mixing Edgar Allan Poe, Jules Verne with an environment similar to the Hellboy films. In my personal Art these themes dominate my work.
In the game I want people to be able to play a standard shooter or spend their time exploring, crafting, mining, or following quests. I've been making art for a very long time, and the first rule is, ""Have the Proper Tools."".
Building out a raw game that has the proper functionality allows us to free our minds of those concerns and focus on telling a Great Story! This is where we are at, at this moment in time.
In Rogue Underworld the British Empire has conquered the known world. The rules of Society are everything. The chances to improve yourself within society are slim without the proper background. As a Rogue you go against the norm of society.
ROGUE:

1. Operating outside normal or desirable controls.
2. An unprincipled, deceitful, and unreliable person; a scoundrel or rascal.
3. One who is playfully mischievous; a scamp.
4. A wandering beggar; a vagrant
5. A vicious and solitary animal.
6. An organism that shows an undesirable variation from a standard.
PRODUCTION AND FUNDING:I am very open to working with other artists, writers, distributors and financiers. I have self-funded the project up to this point. Anyone is free to contact us through the Rogue Community Page or the Steam Concept Page:

<h1>What is Forgotten Myths?</h1>
<p>Forgotten Myths is a free to play online collectible card game that incorporates deck building, card collection and strategic gameplay in a fantastic historical background. You can complete daily quests to gain experience and gold, compete against other players in ladder games and tournaments, and make duels where you can win bounty and cards.</p>
<p>The core card game is most similar to the classic Magic the Gathering. However the gameplay is still unique as it incorporates a much faster style than MtG. The objective is simply to defeat your opponent by reducing his/her life to zero. The battlefield is divided into zones where your attack and fortification cards will go. In order to provide you with a fast and dynamic gameplay, attack phases in Forgotten Myths are automatic. To further add to the strategy, there are fortification and enchantment cards to improve attack cards, as well as various card abilities and spell cards.</p>
Beyond the core game, there is a RPG style level progression and tournament ladder. You can both advance in levels and ranks, while challenging other players in multiplayer tournaments.</div>

<br/><h3>Why develop Forgotten Myths?</h3>
<p>As avid TCG players, fantasy enthusiasts and hardcore gamers, our ultimate dream was to create a long lasting TCG with a great community of players. With a small team and no outside funding, we managed to reach our first major milestone, which was a browser version of the working game. However, we have high hopes for Forgotten Myths and we do not want to stop here; with the help of fellow TCG players, fantasy enthusiasts and gamers, we believe that we can create a high quality, enjoyable and engaging cross-platform online TCG.</p>
<p>We feel that a crowdfunding platform such as Indie Gogo will allow us to connect with you, who -in the end- will make this game live, breathe and jump. Now that we took the project to the closed beta stage on the web, we feel that the timing is right and we can bring Forgotten Myths to a whole new level with your support!</p>

<h2 class=""header1"">Prologue</h2>
<p>It was a time when mankind wages wars with steel and arrows, on horse and on foot, with politics and poison. Science and technology were starting to become servants of men, while mysteries and magic were still not forgotten. The time when kingdoms and empires rose and fell, and all the creatures and beasts that would long be forgotten in myths and legends still roamed free on this world.<br/><br/> Long before mankind started to measure the time he traveled through and the sands of time flew adrift, something happened that would change the fates of us all. Something, or someone, touched the hourglass.<br/><br/> In the center of the world, on the lands that would later be called the cradle of life and civilization; three masters emerged. Three rulers, each different than the other; but each, still very much alike.<br/><br/> Mara, Lord of Esmergon; ruler of bright skies and open steppes; master of noble knights, brave horse lords and mighty griffins; leader of the White Cavalry that brought swift justice to the unholy.<br/><br/> Thengel, Red Shield; a fearsome warlord who crushed her enemies with fearless mercenaries, heavy shielded infantries and giant war elephants; ruling the scorched lands and endless deserts.<br/><br/> Khubera, the Black One; whom, with the power of his immortal assassins and sinister dragons that haunted the worst nightmares; held the lords of all the kingdoms in his grip, trembling in fear by just a whisper of his name. <br/><br/> We did not have any information about the coming of the three. But they were so powerful that their struggle tore down the skies, boiled the oceans, crushed the mountains and destroyed the plains.<br/><br/> Some claimed that this conflict was merely a shadow of an everlasting celestial war that covered the known universe. Some claimed that the three masters were just kings upon men, and their conflict was mortal. Others simply shrugged, and chose to claim nothing. While the ultimate truth about the three kings still remains a mystery, hints and clues about this age remained and were foretold as parts of myths and legends.<br/><br/> It does not matter who I am or how I know all these things; as I will not give you the answers to your questions, neither will I try to explain how everything has ended. I will only tell you jow this story has begun.<br/><br/> The power to forge this epic saga is now in your hands...</p>

Simultaneous Gameplay - Each attack turn is taken at the same time allowing for constant interaction and positioning tactics.

Remote Turn-Based Multiplayer – Play games with anyone in the world, from anywhere with internet access.

Hardcore Strategy - Most digital trading card games have oversimplified and gone all mainstream with their game mechanics. We've done the opposite and increased strategic depth by including positioning, and allowing different card types on the field.

Comprehensive Ever Changing Single Player Campaign - We have an in depth Single Player Campaign, that will have new maps, AIs and new quests added to it frequently.

Transformable Battlefield - The default 3D Battlefield can be changed by unlocking quest rewards that allows you to completely change or customize the table top battlefield.



Prologue
It was a time when mankind wages wars with steel and arrows, on horse and on foot, with politics and poison. Science and technology were starting to become servants of men, while mysteries and magic were still not forgotten. The time when kingdoms and empires rose and fell, and all the creatures and beasts that would long be forgotten in myths and legends still roamed free on this world. Long before mankind started to measure the time he traveled through and the sands of time flew adrift, something happened that would change the fates of us all. Something, or someone, touched the hourglass. In the center of the world, on the lands that would later be called the cradle of life and civilization; three masters emerged. Three rulers, each different than the other; but each, still very much alike. Mara, Lord of Esmergon; ruler of bright skies and open steppes; master of noble knights, brave horse lords and mighty griffins; leader of the White Cavalry that brought swift justice to the unholy. Thengel, Red Shield; a fearsome warlord who crushed her enemies with fearless mercenaries, heavy shielded infantries and giant war elephants; ruling the scorched lands and endless deserts. Khubera, the Black One; whom, with the power of his immortal assassins and sinister dragons that haunted the worst nightmares; held the lords of all the kingdoms in his grip, trembling in fear by just a whisper of his name.  We did not have any information about the coming of the three. But they were so powerful that their struggle tore down the skies, boiled the oceans, crushed the mountains and destroyed the plains. Some claimed that this conflict was merely a shadow of an everlasting celestial war that covered the known universe. Some claimed that the three masters were just kings upon men, and their conflict was mortal. Others simply shrugged, and chose to claim nothing. While the ultimate truth about the three kings still remains a mystery, hints and clues about this age remained and were foretold as parts of myths and legends. It does not matter who I am or how I know all these things; as I will not give you the answers to your questions, neither will I try to explain how everything has ended. I will only tell you jow this story has begun. The power to forge this epic saga is now in your hands...

Our success with this program has been fueled by scholarships, donations, volunteers, and pro players who want to step up as role models!
<p class=""_mce_tagged_br"">We want to influence more kids around the world who haven't had a BCI Basketball Plus opportunity by connecting them with basketball pros online,  So we are introducing: <strong>    </strong></p>
<p><strong>BCI Courtside Live</strong> - <strong>a real-time, interactive video chat with the pros about the practical and spiritual aspects of life in the professional basketball world!  </strong></p>
<p>Here's how BCI Courtside Live works:  First you'll log in to watch a live interview between pro players and a BCI host.  Then, you can text questions - and you could be selected to join the chat via video!  The result!  An interactive, engaging, and kid-friendly experience - where everyone (including the next generation of heroes and their parents) can connect with role models:  pro basketball players who've really stepped up their game.</p>
<p><strong>More Opportunities. More Kids.</strong></p>
<p>When you back Basketball Club Internataional, you're helping us provide LIFE-CHANGING opportunities for pro basketball players to interact with fans and kids.  Here are just a few other examples:<strong><br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connecting non-profits organizations with integrity-and values-driven pro players, especially for kids-focused events.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Youth Leadership Summits, where BCI adds values-based support to a group of non-profits and government service agencies that focus on an entire community.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>U.S. and international BCI Clinics, short-and-sweet (with lasting impact!) kids' skills programs featuring pro players.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Do You Think?<br/></strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p><span style="""">Do you believe that athlete celebrity influence is inevitable? Do you think kids are especially vulnerable to the messages they hear from the pros?  </span></p>
<p>We believe the answer is yes and YES. Every day, kids emulate professional athletes through their clothing, behavior, choices, and their values. Athletes endorse products in exchange for millions of dollars which, in turn, reinforces their celebrity image. It's a cycle, and we all buy into it -- especially kids.</p>
<p>Do you think that a cycle of influence can be awesome if there's a great message? Well, we KNOW it!</p>

<h2><strong>Stepping Up, Reaching Out</strong></h2>
<p>Basketball Club International (BCI) was founded to support professional basketball players who are willing to step up their game. This means holding themselves and each other accountable for their choices -- so that, together, they may influence the next generation in a positive way.</p>
<p>The funds from this campaign will be used to expand the reach of BCI's connection with professional basketball players globally, providing these men with support through BCI Loop (and opportunities through BCI Leads) so they can be the best role models and influencers to kids around the world. See our program list below and watch our Indiegogo video!</p>
<p>We believe that over the next 5 to 10 years, BCI will become an indispensable part of the professional basketball machine. A strong ""loop"" of players who support each other in a personal, meaningful way will inspire the younger generation to carry themselves at a level higher <span style="""">– </span>higher,  perhaps, than the circumstances that produced them.</p>
<p>One NBA All-Pro asked a group of BCI Players at a leadership summit, ""Can you imagine what an impact BCI will have worldwide?"" Well, we have imagined it. We're doing it! Now, we're asking you to add your voice to ours by joining this amazing movement.</p>

<p><span>The biggest miniatures in Saphir are about to arrive. Some are so huge that other miniatures will climb their backs... or be crushed by their toenails!</span></p>
<p>We need at least 6.000€ to sculpt and cast three superior combatant miniatures: Ikarus, Hinos and Ratfuten that will complete the two existing ones: Leviathan and Werebull. We already have some concepts and the rules of these and, in order to build them, we offer you the possibility to obtain the bands' starter packs and build your full band with the existing miniatures.</p>
<p>These miniatures are going to be really big, take as an example the superior combatant of the Scions of Kurgan, the Leviathan. The Leviathan will look small next to Hinos or the Ratfuten because... these will have Imps and Kluchs mounted on them!!!</p>

<p>We have a wide range of perks, from the cheapest to the most complete perks with everything-we-have for very interesting prices. We have prefered to keep this campaign with few new miniatures in order to deliver it to you before the 2012 year ends, but if we achieve some of our goals we plan to start giving you some interesting extras of forecoming bands and special edition miniatures of current bands, it is in your hand!!</p>
<h2>Recommended Perks</h2>
<p>Most of them are quite clear, because they include something specific. But some other include choices and the possibility to add some options, so we made some diagrams to clarify these Perks with some complexity.</p>

<p><span>Yenay was an Agent of Malesur who operated in Darlime for many years, helping those faithful to the Father intending to travel to the Forest of Lilean. During that time, she was one of the Legion of the One Hundred Hearts´ most wanted people, and huge rewards were offered for her head. After two decades as a representative of the Adepts of Malesur in Darlime, she finally embarked with Shaogi and travelled to the Forest of Lilean for the first time after so many years of devotion to Malesur. She was welcomed there with all the honours by all her brothers and sisters, among whom there were those she had helped to leave Darlime to start a new life in the Forest of Lilean themselves.</span></p>

<h2>Some background</h2>
<div>
<p>The main features of SphereWars are:<a href=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/527274/files/20121107135841-RuleBook_SphereWars_low.pdf?1352325621"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""SphereWars rulebook""><br/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>An incredible gameplay dinamism, which requires both players to pay attention to the game, not only during their turn, but also during the opponent's turn. Both players can make interrupts to avoid being attacked or change skills so that attacking you can backfire on your opponent (or yourself :))</li>
<li>SphereWars is settled in a whole new world of fantasy, 'Saphir', with groundbreaking bands and backgrounds that allow us creating spectacular miniatures.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Please note that all miniatures require some assembly and painting. Most are metal-cast but the Superiors and the War machines that are cast in resin.</p>
<p>These are the gods of Saphir:<br/><img alt=""The four Gods of Saphir"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk87/yordiket/DiosesSaphir_564.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""The four Gods of Saphir""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Kurgan</strong>, the God of Ice, who also shows predilection for warfare, <br/>battles and martial harshness. He instils a high passion for combat in his creations and shapes mighty, fierce beings who frequently prove themselves to be true predators.His children in Saphir are the Scions of Kurgan, both soimi and regor.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kazag</strong>, God of Incineration, he seeks for his creations to prevail by means of overwhelming numerical superiority, defeating their rivals like a swarm. His children, the Packs of Urueh, battle’s main law is simple: Why fight enemies when you can just... incinerate them?</li>
<li>
<strong>Malesur</strong>, God of Wind, does not feel an excessive passion for battle or destruction, he prefers to obtain mastery over his brothers by means of the evolution of his creatures. Malesur created the humans that conform the Alliance. When they forgot their god, he favoured a few chosen and granted each of them the ability to take on the physical aspect of powerful beasts, confering them extraordinary power and strength in the process, these are the Adepts of Malesur.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mohed</strong>, the God of Sand and Rock, who has a penchant to use these elements to shape his creations. Like Kurgan, Mohed takes great pleasure in duels and battles. More reserved than his brothers, Mohed only acts when the circumstances demand it and his current plans in Saphir remain unknown.</li>
<li>
<strong>Salssa’el</strong> is the Goddess of Life. She is a wise and prudent being who prefers to keep apart from what she considers silly sibling rivalries. She is, therefore, the only one between the gods who has not joined the game of war raging among the spheres, and who rejects the death each and all of her four brothers cause with their endless battle, despising all of them alike.She insufflates the breath of life upon her brothers' creations. This is probably the reason why she despises how carelessly they reap hundreds of lives.She had a key role in the creation of the Newborns race, when she allowed a human to discover the power of the Quitessence. Although while her intentions were pure, her actions brought a new misfortune and evolved into new battles for power between the factions in Saphir.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game was created in Spain and, during the last couple of years, we have stablished a faithful group of players but we really need to reach players abroad.</p>
<p>We think that completing the superior combatants of the three bands that are still missing them, is a good opportunity to show our game to the players outside our country and, at the same time achieve this goal of completing the superior combatants. Economy is not very well in Spain and that makes necessary to make our market to grow.</p>
<p>We are working on new bands that we would like to release once current five bands have all necessary miniatures. This campaign will help us to be known outside Spain and, at the same time, get enough income to ensure the continuity of the SphereWars project.</p>

<h3><span>From all the Saphir creatures, is amongst the Scions of Kurgan where the most powerful and terrible can be found. They are the soimi, which together with their brother race, the regor, have become one of mankind´s (and other races in the sphere) main enemies. Not for anything the soimi are predators feeding on the vital energy of other creatures, which they absorb by sticking their tentacles in their victims. On their behalf, the regor share the hunger of their big brothers, but they lack stings. In return, they have a ferocity that make them very dangerous beings, and also their tails end in sharp blades able to inflict terrible wounds to their enemies.</span></h3>

<h3><span>Among all the bands you can play in SphereWars, the Alliance is by far the one with a more medieval look, a more classical approach to the Middle Ages as we think of them nowadays. That reason makes many players to move towards them just for using a band made up of hardened knights and skilful amazons. However, these are not by far their only attractive.</span></h3>
<h3><span>You can play Alliance with any of the two factions:  The Legion of the One Hundred Hearts, composed only of man knights, The Amazons of Ishar, composed only by battler women or a combination of both in true alliance. Playing with any of them will take effect on your strenghts and weaknesses.</span></h3>

<h3>There is no other band in the SphereWars universe as versatile as the Packs of Urueh, made up of very different creatures with two things in common: all of them are the work of Kazag, god of incineration, and of course, their only aim is to destroy everything and everyone in their way. Wild and unforeseeable, we can grant you will roar with laughter as you lead these small and fiendish incinerators.</h3>
<h3>Combatants of this band may seem weak and small but the low cost of most of its disposable combatants makes Packs of Urueh bands to be overwhelming in number, being able to get rid of much stronger combatants thanks to exhaustion and small wounds.</h3>

<h3><span>The Adepts of Malesur band is visually very attractive. That is because the leaders and troops are utterly captivating: you can find all kinds of fierce animal people which, however, display some human features.<br/> But, of course, the attractiveness of its miniatures is not by far the only strong point of the band. </span></h3>
<h3><span>Unlike other bands, playing with them is also different due to their individual characteristics. And that is because every troop type you can choose from is focused on some specific function which, most likely, no other troop can do and their level of belief in Malesur allows transfering information between them and take effects in their comrade-in-arms.</span></h3>

Web / English Forum / Spanish Forum / SphereShop
SphereWars is a 28mm miniatures fantasy wargame in a World, Saphir, created by four gods who play with the races they conceived.

Download the Rulebook in pdf format.

Three Superior Combatants are required


The biggest miniatures in Saphir are about to arrive. Some are so huge that other miniatures will climb their backs... or be crushed by their toenails!
We need at least 6.000€ to sculpt and cast three superior combatant miniatures: Ikarus, Hinos and Ratfuten that will complete the two existing ones: Leviathan and Werebull. We already have some concepts and the rules of these and, in order to build them, we offer you the possibility to obtain the bands' starter packs and build your full band with the existing miniatures.
These miniatures are going to be really big, take as an example the superior combatant of the Scions of Kurgan, the Leviathan. The Leviathan will look small next to Hinos or the Ratfuten because... these will have Imps and Kluchs mounted on them!!!


We have a wide range of perks, from the cheapest to the most complete perks with everything-we-have for very interesting prices. We have prefered to keep this campaign with few new miniatures in order to deliver it to you before the 2012 year ends, but if we achieve some of our goals we plan to start giving you some interesting extras of forecoming bands and special edition miniatures of current bands, it is in your hand!!
Recommended Perks
Most of them are quite clear, because they include something specific. But some other include choices and the possibility to add some options, so we made some diagrams to clarify these Perks with some complexity.

The Warrior Combatant is your perk if you like one band and know other players who will also pick this perk in order to start combating. 

The Elite Combatant is the choice if you want to give the game a try with a couple or bands or just want test if miniature gaming may be interesting for you and a friend who may ocassionally come to your home.

 

The Superior combatant is the choice for those players who already have a band and want to play bigger skirmish at 1.000 points using the Superior combatants or collectors who like one or more Superior combatants (the actual aim of this campaign).
 

The Avatar combatant is ideal if you are a couple of friends who want to start playing with two different bands or you want to start playing but you are not sure about which band suits more your game style. Note that the Avatar combatant is a really special price limited to 50 units. GAME INFO: each band has nearly 400 points (including the Starter Pack and one of the Leaders) additional miniatures add extra points.







The Leader combatants are ideal if you fell in love with one or more specific bands or you want to collect a full band of miniatures. GAME INFO: each band has nearly over 1000 points: Scions of Kurgan 1500p, Alliance 1550p, Packs of Urueh 1250p, Adepts of Malesur 1200p, Newborns 1400p.


The God of Saphir is for those who want it all. You want a miniature of each for an incredible price with a 40% of discount. GAME INFO: all miniatures are around 5700 points.

Yenay was an Agent of Malesur who operated in Darlime for many years, helping those faithful to the Father intending to travel to the Forest of Lilean. During that time, she was one of the Legion of the One Hundred Hearts´ most wanted people, and huge rewards were offered for her head. After two decades as a representative of the Adepts of Malesur in Darlime, she finally embarked with Shaogi and travelled to the Forest of Lilean for the first time after so many years of devotion to Malesur. She was welcomed there with all the honours by all her brothers and sisters, among whom there were those she had helped to leave Darlime to start a new life in the Forest of Lilean themselves.

Some background

The main features of SphereWars are:

An incredible gameplay dinamism, which requires both players to pay attention to the game, not only during their turn, but also during the opponent's turn. Both players can make interrupts to avoid being attacked or change skills so that attacking you can backfire on your opponent (or yourself :))
SphereWars is settled in a whole new world of fantasy, 'Saphir', with groundbreaking bands and backgrounds that allow us creating spectacular miniatures.


Please note that all miniatures require some assembly and painting. Most are metal-cast but the Superiors and the War machines that are cast in resin.
These are the gods of Saphir:


Kurgan, the God of Ice, who also shows predilection for warfare, battles and martial harshness. He instils a high passion for combat in his creations and shapes mighty, fierce beings who frequently prove themselves to be true predators.His children in Saphir are the Scions of Kurgan, both soimi and regor.

Kazag, God of Incineration, he seeks for his creations to prevail by means of overwhelming numerical superiority, defeating their rivals like a swarm. His children, the Packs of Urueh, battle’s main law is simple: Why fight enemies when you can just... incinerate them?

Malesur, God of Wind, does not feel an excessive passion for battle or destruction, he prefers to obtain mastery over his brothers by means of the evolution of his creatures. Malesur created the humans that conform the Alliance. When they forgot their god, he favoured a few chosen and granted each of them the ability to take on the physical aspect of powerful beasts, confering them extraordinary power and strength in the process, these are the Adepts of Malesur.

Mohed, the God of Sand and Rock, who has a penchant to use these elements to shape his creations. Like Kurgan, Mohed takes great pleasure in duels and battles. More reserved than his brothers, Mohed only acts when the circumstances demand it and his current plans in Saphir remain unknown.

Salssa’el is the Goddess of Life. She is a wise and prudent being who prefers to keep apart from what she considers silly sibling rivalries. She is, therefore, the only one between the gods who has not joined the game of war raging among the spheres, and who rejects the death each and all of her four brothers cause with their endless battle, despising all of them alike.She insufflates the breath of life upon her brothers' creations. This is probably the reason why she despises how carelessly they reap hundreds of lives.She had a key role in the creation of the Newborns race, when she allowed a human to discover the power of the Quitessence. Although while her intentions were pure, her actions brought a new misfortune and evolved into new battles for power between the factions in Saphir.

The game was created in Spain and, during the last couple of years, we have stablished a faithful group of players but we really need to reach players abroad.
We think that completing the superior combatants of the three bands that are still missing them, is a good opportunity to show our game to the players outside our country and, at the same time achieve this goal of completing the superior combatants. Economy is not very well in Spain and that makes necessary to make our market to grow.
We are working on new bands that we would like to release once current five bands have all necessary miniatures. This campaign will help us to be known outside Spain and, at the same time, get enough income to ensure the continuity of the SphereWars project.

Our current bands











Scions of Kurgan

From all the Saphir creatures, is amongst the Scions of Kurgan where the most powerful and terrible can be found. They are the soimi, which together with their brother race, the regor, have become one of mankind´s (and other races in the sphere) main enemies. Not for anything the soimi are predators feeding on the vital energy of other creatures, which they absorb by sticking their tentacles in their victims. On their behalf, the regor share the hunger of their big brothers, but they lack stings. In return, they have a ferocity that make them very dangerous beings, and also their tails end in sharp blades able to inflict terrible wounds to their enemies.

Alliance












Among all the bands you can play in SphereWars, the Alliance is by far the one with a more medieval look, a more classical approach to the Middle Ages as we think of them nowadays. That reason makes many players to move towards them just for using a band made up of hardened knights and skilful amazons. However, these are not by far their only attractive.
You can play Alliance with any of the two factions:  The Legion of the One Hundred Hearts, composed only of man knights, The Amazons of Ishar, composed only by battler women or a combination of both in true alliance. Playing with any of them will take effect on your strenghts and weaknesses.

Packs of Urueh

There is no other band in the SphereWars universe as versatile as the Packs of Urueh, made up of very different creatures with two things in common: all of them are the work of Kazag, god of incineration, and of course, their only aim is to destroy everything and everyone in their way. Wild and unforeseeable, we can grant you will roar with laughter as you lead these small and fiendish incinerators.
Combatants of this band may seem weak and small but the low cost of most of its disposable combatants makes Packs of Urueh bands to be overwhelming in number, being able to get rid of much stronger combatants thanks to exhaustion and small wounds.

Adepts of Malesur
The Adepts of Malesur band is visually very attractive. That is because the leaders and troops are utterly captivating: you can find all kinds of fierce animal people which, however, display some human features. But, of course, the attractiveness of its miniatures is not by far the only strong point of the band. 
Unlike other bands, playing with them is also different due to their individual characteristics. And that is because every troop type you can choose from is focused on some specific function which, most likely, no other troop can do and their level of belief in Malesur allows transfering information between them and take effects in their comrade-in-arms.

Newborns
The Newborns emerged in Darlime motivated by the disagreement of an important amount of its inhabitants towards the One Hundred Hearts Legion's instaured government. Unlike the Legion, the Newborns potentiate and acquire all kind of new discoveries in order to evolve in several areas such as alchemy, mechanics and other sciences seriously restricted by the Legion of the One Hundred Hearts. Leaded by the misterious Master, a man with a past and face unknown even between his followers, many are the achievements achieved during the years.

Ever since I was small it was my dream to build a game and publish it. I created lots of small games, but I was never able to publish it properly. You can view my portfolio over here: <a href=""http://www.dark-eclipse.nl/index.php?p=games"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.dark-eclipse.nl/index.php?p=games</a></p>
<p>It is my dream to actually be able to build and publish a great game that people enjoy to the official App Store. If there are enough funds raised, this can be made possible and I would be soooo happy! :D On top of that, everyone with an iDevice will be able to download this fun to play puzzle game, and enjoy this game as much as I do. :)</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What's this game about?</span></h3>
This project is about a puzzle game, Elements, in which you have to combine elements of the same type to make them vanish. When all elements are combined you complete the level and continue to the next level. The game contains lots of levels divided in level packs, each with their own style and gameplay. The game has multi-language support. In the video you might have noticed that the language is not English. However, the language of the game will adapt to the location of the user.</div>

<p>Turf Battles is a 3D MMORPG unlike any other. It holds a very large emphasis on the PVP Aspect of games that makes it quite the riveting and exciting experience. Players are able to progress in Turf Battles rather quickly and engage in territorial battles against other players, either by themselves or with members of their Tribe(Guild). These battles determine ownership over Turfs that are inhabited by monsters that, when killed, drop valuable items used in upgrading character items and skills. Players must defend the Turfs from invading Tribes (Guilds). Although character progression is important, it is not the deciding factor in a battle. Players can hone their skills by cutting and stacking their skills together, much like with combo's. Skills have 0 cast time, and only a very few skills have cool downs. </p>
<p>Turf Battles was released in America, but unfortunately it was later shut down. To those of you who played Turf Battles, you know of the riveting and exciting game play I'm speaking of. You probably have even followed the game through it's multiple failed versions, and even tried to play other MMORPG's. However I bet no other MMORPG but the original Turf Battles has ever given you the form of satisfaction and enjoyment that Turf Battles did. The thrill of performing time sensitive combinations of attacks, movement, and jumping in order to defeat enemy players in all out war simply does not exist in any other MMORPG.</p>

 We started this campaign because there are still some features that need to be finished. We have exhausted nearly all of our resources, and need this last push in order to quickly finish the game. These systems include:


Trading System
Warehouse System
Quest System
Finishing some outsourced back-end work (this is a huge undertaking)





Upon us reaching our goal of $9000 USD, we will be releasing the game in it's first Beta Testing Phase 1-2 weeks upon the campaign's goal being reached. As well anyone who donates, will be able to unlock various Perks that will be given to them at the correct corresponding times. These perks do stack, so you can purchase 3 of the same perk for example. This will be our FINAL Indiegogo Campaign. Some of the perks offered here will NEVER be offered again, meaning some of the rewards will be a rare find in the game.
When Will The Game Come Out?
We expect that the game will be released sometime between early February and/or early March. If the campaign is a success, we will be launching into Alpha 1-2 weeks after the campaigns goal is reached. For example if the campaign goal is reached on February 1, you can expect to play sometime starting February 1st-February 15th if you have donated towards the Alpha Testing Perks in this campaign, or in our previous Indiegogo Campaign, or via our website donation page. 



Turf Battles is a 3D MMORPG unlike any other. It holds a very large emphasis on the PVP Aspect of games that makes it quite the riveting and exciting experience. Players are able to progress in Turf Battles rather quickly and engage in territorial battles against other players, either by themselves or with members of their Tribe(Guild). These battles determine ownership over Turfs that are inhabited by monsters that, when killed, drop valuable items used in upgrading character items and skills. Players must defend the Turfs from invading Tribes (Guilds). Although character progression is important, it is not the deciding factor in a battle. Players can hone their skills by cutting and stacking their skills together, much like with combo's. Skills have 0 cast time, and only a very few skills have cool downs. 
Turf Battles was released in America, but unfortunately it was later shut down. To those of you who played Turf Battles, you know of the riveting and exciting game play I'm speaking of. You probably have even followed the game through it's multiple failed versions, and even tried to play other MMORPG's. However I bet no other MMORPG but the original Turf Battles has ever given you the form of satisfaction and enjoyment that Turf Battles did. The thrill of performing time sensitive combinations of attacks, movement, and jumping in order to defeat enemy players in all out war simply does not exist in any other MMORPG.",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

It recreates the initiatory journey of a knight seeking the Holy Grail in fifth century Britain.</div>
<div>
<h3>Features</h3>
<div><ul>
<li>Unique stories inspired by the Matter of Britain.</li>
<li>Find your Graal based on the choices you make.</li>
<li>Narrative game inspired by the Choose Your Own Adventure book.</li>
<li>Fast tactical battles. Prove your combat skills in real time.</li>
<li>Procedurally generated events and maps. You always will have different opportunities to prove your courage.</li>
<li>Permadeath and persistent world.</li>
<li>Moddability. Create and share your own Graal stories.</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div>
<h3><span>What is the Graal?</span></h3>
<p>The <b>Graal</b> (or Holy Grail), the
subject of myths and legends, can take several forms depending on the
tradition: a chalice, a cauldron, or even an emerald. All covet
it for its famed magical powers. But what is it really? </p>
<p>In Graal Seeker, you are an adventurer from the fifth century seeking this relic for fame, fortune, or faith. You can also join Arthur's court in his fight against the Saxons and spread justice throughout the land. But is the recent Saxon invasion related to the presence of the Holy Graal on British soil, or is it merely an excuse for territorial conquest?</p>
<p>From Celtic origins to Christian and esoteric texts, the quest for the Graal has inspired seekers for centuries. Graal Seeker provides a truly
initiatory and introspective quest that evolves with your choices and experience. So it is the player who makes the story!</p>
<h3>Universe</h3>
<p>Graal Seeker's universe is inspired by the Matter of Britain, which includes both historical and mythological literature associated with Great Britain, and many other well-known sources. While many stories about the Graal take place in the high middle ages, we choose to go back to the original early middle ages. </p>
<p>After Roman retreat from Britain, the Britons faced Saxon invasion and Pictish raids. You will have to choose between 12 characters to achieve your quest for the Graal. Your quest may differ depending on the nation you will choose.</p>
<h4>The nations</h4>
<div>There are three nations; only the Britons will be available at the beginning of the game. Playing with a different nation will change the behavior of your encounters and gives you access to a unique skill.<br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/843070/files/20140908123512-char_britons.jpg?1410204912"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>At this time, <b>Britons </b>were the main people living in England. During the Roman occupation, their traditional Celtic culture mingled with their occupiers' and they became Christians. They are struggling to protect their lands after the departure of the Roman army and restore their pagan heritage. They are a proud people with a certain appeal for honor and justice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/843072/files/20140908123536-char_saxons.jpg?1410204936"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
The <b>Saxons </b>were first summoned by the
Britons as mercenaries to fight against the Pictish incursions. But
they quickly began to enjoy the fertile lands of Britannia and now
wish to conquer it. The Saxons are a nation of ruthless fighters preoccupied with the future of their people and determined to succeed whatever it takes.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
The <b>Picts </b>are a mysterious people
living in the north of Great Britain, in an area called Caledonia by
the Romans. The Caledonian territory is separated from the rest of
the island by Hadrian's Wall. They have never submitted to the
Roman army, and they are now taking advantage of the chaos in the Briton
territories to enrich themselves by raiding. The Picts are a people with a touch of madness and a love of freedom.</p>
<h4>The classes</h4>
<div>There are five available classes from the beginning of the game. They have different skills and attributes that open up new tactics. As you play your character will evolve and you will get to choose new skills.</div>

<p>The <b>knight </b>is an elite warrior who has sworn to protect his people against all
threats and help them acquire what is best for them. He is guided by

<h4>The profiles</h4>
<p>You will have to choose between five character profiles that change things up a bit.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The
<b>tenacious</b> gives up less easily.<br/>
</li>
<li>The
<b>strapping</b> is much stronger.<br/>
</li>
<li>The
<b>adroit</b> has more agility.<br/>
</li>
<li>The
<b>clever</b> one can earn more skills when he levels up.<br/>
</li>
<li>The
<b>tribune</b> can have more choices during an event. He
can convince people more easily and avoid fighting with his
eloquence.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br/><h3>Gameplay</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>In Graal Seeker, you must complete three phases one after the other until you find the Graal or die.</p>
<h4>The Exploration phase</h4>
<p>The exploration phase allows you to choose where to go in a procedurally generated map. Would you rather tread a long, calm road or take a shortcut and face potential obstacles?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/847423/files/20140910091851-map_optimized.gif?1410365931"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For now, it looks like this, but soon there will be roads and rivers! In this map, you can't travel from place to place at will. You have to move to a neighboring position.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will need to visit a specific place after accepting a quest. A quest marker will then be added. You can use your quest log to remind you of the current quests.</p>
<p>As a sign of commitment in your quest for the Holy Graal, your willpower may decrease or increase depending on your route. Be careful, because when your willpower reaches zero, your quest ends. Besides, a willingness to maximum makes it easier to reach the Graal.<br/></p>
<h4>The Event/Dialogue phase</h4>
<p>Different events happen according to your location (such as castle, village, and forest) and your previous choices. Will the local lord welcome you? If not, how will you react?
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/843394/files/20140908143644-GraalSeeker_early_ingame_screenshot_dial3.jpg?1410212204"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You will have to choose between a maximum of 4 choices per event. In a same event, different choices can appear since they are linked to your previous choices, skills, profile, team and inventory. So you will probably be able to bribe a guard if you have enough money, impress a lord if you have Excalibur, or avoid a fight with Saxons if you have a Saxon in your team.</p>
<p>Since choices represent different actions, some icons allow you to quickly understand the action. Here is an overview of the different icons.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/844558/files/20140909034932-dial.gif?1410259772"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Remember that Graal Seeker procedurally generates content! So the same choice could lead to different results! For example, you can see a camp not far away and decide to go there. But it could be bandits or people in need. You never know until you make your decision.</p>
<h4>The Combat</h4>
<p>And finally, battles will bring fast combat in real-time with a tactical dimension. But be careful not to die, because there is permadeath!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/844992/files/20140909083235-Lugludum_GraalSeeker_early_ingame_screenshot_combat2.png?1410276755"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>How does the combat work? </p>
<p>You have a team of 1 to 4 people. Most of the time you have to kill your enemy but sometimes you will have to achieve other objectives such as setting free someone or surviving multiple waves.</p>
<p>All fighters will automatically attack when in range, but you will have the responsibility to move your team and to select their talents. A talent is a skill that can be passive, or it may need to be activated. </p>
<p>The passive ones can give you some nice advantages through the whole duration of the fight : more damage, shoot arrows farther, etc.</p>
<p>The active talents are handled differently. Some of them can be triggered immediately, others have a charging time before being triggered and can be interrupted by a special talent of the opponent, and some of them have a cooldown timer that prevents them from being used again immediately. During the fight you can select up to 3 talents in the talent queue of your character.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/844998/files/20140909083449-talent_cycle_left.gif?1410276889"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/844999/files/20140909083456-talent_cycle_right.gif?1410276896"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And of course you can cancel a talent anytime you want.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/844776/files/20140909065019-talent_remove.gif?1410270619"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
If it's too fast for you, you can just pause the fight and continue to select/cancel your talents and move your characters.<br/>
</div>
<div>Here are some animations you could see in the combat.</div>

<h2>What we need and what you get</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3>Initial goal</h3>
<div>This campaign is designed to help us focus only on Graal Seeker and give us the proper motivation to reach our goal : to release the game next year and to release a private alpha in November.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Funds</h3>
<div>We plan to release Graal Seeker in the first quarter of 2015.  But first, there will be a private alpha and a private beta. </div>
<div>Funds are allocated to materials such as graphics, stories, music and communication. It will allow us to release the game next year and provide a good alpha release in November.</div>
<div>Also, we estimate that 1000€ will be needed to fulfil the perks cost for the initial goal (t-shirt, silkscreen poster, postcard).</div>
<div>Additionally, we have of course some taxes and fees from the French government, Indiegogo and Paypal.<br/>
</div>
<div>Finally, we have only a small portion reserved to our programmer because it's already budgeted, but a better hardware will greatly improve his work. So we have included it in this first goal!</div>
<div>Funds will be used as follows to hold to the deadlines as fully as possible. This chart only applies to the initial goal. We will update it once it is reached.<br/>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>We chose a flexible campaign because it's not an <i>all or nothing</i> campaign. We’ve been working on the project for six months, but we’re in the final stretch now. <br/></p>
<p>One of our first challenges is to build a strong community around Graal Seeker to help us improve the game even while it's still in development. Making a great game will be another challenge, but we are pretty sure that we can get awesome results with all of you, especially during the alpha and beta phases! Graal Seeker is our first game and this is the main reason why we need support from you more than ever. </p>
<p>At this point, the risk we still face is in raising the funds we need to hit the release date we aim for in the first quarter of 2015. This campaign will help us get that much closer to sharing those Graal stories with the world.</p>
<ul></ul>

What is Graal Seeker?Graal Seeker is a 2D game that blends RPG with roguelike mechanics and real-time tactical battles. It recreates the initiatory journey of a knight seeking the Holy Grail in fifth century Britain.

Features

Unique stories inspired by the Matter of Britain.
Find your Graal based on the choices you make.
Narrative game inspired by the Choose Your Own Adventure book.
Fast tactical battles. Prove your combat skills in real time.
Procedurally generated events and maps. You always will have different opportunities to prove your courage.
Permadeath and persistent world.
Moddability. Create and share your own Graal stories.



What is the Graal?
The Graal (or Holy Grail), the
subject of myths and legends, can take several forms depending on the
tradition: a chalice, a cauldron, or even an emerald. All covet
it for its famed magical powers. But what is it really? 
In Graal Seeker, you are an adventurer from the fifth century seeking this relic for fame, fortune, or faith. You can also join Arthur's court in his fight against the Saxons and spread justice throughout the land. But is the recent Saxon invasion related to the presence of the Holy Graal on British soil, or is it merely an excuse for territorial conquest?
From Celtic origins to Christian and esoteric texts, the quest for the Graal has inspired seekers for centuries. Graal Seeker provides a truly
initiatory and introspective quest that evolves with your choices and experience. So it is the player who makes the story!
Universe
Graal Seeker's universe is inspired by the Matter of Britain, which includes both historical and mythological literature associated with Great Britain, and many other well-known sources. While many stories about the Graal take place in the high middle ages, we choose to go back to the original early middle ages. 
After Roman retreat from Britain, the Britons faced Saxon invasion and Pictish raids. You will have to choose between 12 characters to achieve your quest for the Graal. Your quest may differ depending on the nation you will choose.
The nations
There are three nations; only the Britons will be available at the beginning of the game. Playing with a different nation will change the behavior of your encounters and gives you access to a unique skill.



At this time, Britons were the main people living in England. During the Roman occupation, their traditional Celtic culture mingled with their occupiers' and they became Christians. They are struggling to protect their lands after the departure of the Roman army and restore their pagan heritage. They are a proud people with a certain appeal for honor and justice.




The Saxons were first summoned by the
Britons as mercenaries to fight against the Pictish incursions. But
they quickly began to enjoy the fertile lands of Britannia and now
wish to conquer it. The Saxons are a nation of ruthless fighters preoccupied with the future of their people and determined to succeed whatever it takes.




The Picts are a mysterious people
living in the north of Great Britain, in an area called Caledonia by
the Romans. The Caledonian territory is separated from the rest of
the island by Hadrian's Wall. They have never submitted to the
Roman army, and they are now taking advantage of the chaos in the Briton
territories to enrich themselves by raiding. The Picts are a people with a touch of madness and a love of freedom.
The classes
There are five available classes from the beginning of the game. They have different skills and attributes that open up new tactics. As you play your character will evolve and you will get to choose new skills.



The knight is an elite warrior who has sworn to protect his people against all
threats and help them acquire what is best for them. He is guided by
the values of loyalty, courage, and honour. He wields a large number
of weapons and he is built for close-combat.


The druid was raised with the
mysteries of magic and science. He is the privileged guardian of the
faith and the gateway to the gods. 


The bard travels from place to place to spread his knowledge and arts
through poems and songs.


The archer is specialized in ranged combat. He handles the bow with great dexterity. As a member of the army, he does what he can to protect
his people.



In a time of trouble, peasants take up arms sometimes  to protect themselves from raids or to
establish an organized thievery.

The profiles
You will have to choose between five character profiles that change things up a bit.


The
tenacious gives up less easily.

The
strapping is much stronger.

The
adroit has more agility.

The
clever one can earn more skills when he levels up.

The
tribune can have more choices during an event. He
can convince people more easily and avoid fighting with his
eloquence.


Gameplay


In Graal Seeker, you must complete three phases one after the other until you find the Graal or die.
The Exploration phase
The exploration phase allows you to choose where to go in a procedurally generated map. Would you rather tread a long, calm road or take a shortcut and face potential obstacles?

For now, it looks like this, but soon there will be roads and rivers! In this map, you can't travel from place to place at will. You have to move to a neighboring position.
Sometimes you will need to visit a specific place after accepting a quest. A quest marker will then be added. You can use your quest log to remind you of the current quests.
As a sign of commitment in your quest for the Holy Graal, your willpower may decrease or increase depending on your route. Be careful, because when your willpower reaches zero, your quest ends. Besides, a willingness to maximum makes it easier to reach the Graal.
The Event/Dialogue phase
Different events happen according to your location (such as castle, village, and forest) and your previous choices. Will the local lord welcome you? If not, how will you react?


You will have to choose between a maximum of 4 choices per event. In a same event, different choices can appear since they are linked to your previous choices, skills, profile, team and inventory. So you will probably be able to bribe a guard if you have enough money, impress a lord if you have Excalibur, or avoid a fight with Saxons if you have a Saxon in your team.
Since choices represent different actions, some icons allow you to quickly understand the action. Here is an overview of the different icons.

Remember that Graal Seeker procedurally generates content! So the same choice could lead to different results! For example, you can see a camp not far away and decide to go there. But it could be bandits or people in need. You never know until you make your decision.
The Combat
And finally, battles will bring fast combat in real-time with a tactical dimension. But be careful not to die, because there is permadeath!

How does the combat work? 
You have a team of 1 to 4 people. Most of the time you have to kill your enemy but sometimes you will have to achieve other objectives such as setting free someone or surviving multiple waves.
All fighters will automatically attack when in range, but you will have the responsibility to move your team and to select their talents. A talent is a skill that can be passive, or it may need to be activated. 
The passive ones can give you some nice advantages through the whole duration of the fight : more damage, shoot arrows farther, etc.
The active talents are handled differently. Some of them can be triggered immediately, others have a charging time before being triggered and can be interrupted by a special talent of the opponent, and some of them have a cooldown timer that prevents them from being used again immediately. During the fight you can select up to 3 talents in the talent queue of your character.




 
And of course you can cancel a talent anytime you want.

If it's too fast for you, you can just pause the fight and continue to select/cancel your talents and move your characters.

Here are some animations you could see in the combat.









What we need and what you get



Initial goal
This campaign is designed to help us focus only on Graal Seeker and give us the proper motivation to reach our goal : to release the game next year and to release a private alpha in November.

Funds
We plan to release Graal Seeker in the first quarter of 2015.  But first, there will be a private alpha and a private beta. 
Funds are allocated to materials such as graphics, stories, music and communication. It will allow us to release the game next year and provide a good alpha release in November.
Also, we estimate that 1000€ will be needed to fulfil the perks cost for the initial goal (t-shirt, silkscreen poster, postcard).
Additionally, we have of course some taxes and fees from the French government, Indiegogo and Paypal.

Finally, we have only a small portion reserved to our programmer because it's already budgeted, but a better hardware will greatly improve his work. So we have included it in this first goal!
Funds will be used as follows to hold to the deadlines as fully as possible. This chart only applies to the initial goal. We will update it once it is reached.








Perks
Please have a look at the perks right below. You will find some exclusive and awesome content. 





Consider these few details :



Credits : you will have your name in the game's credits depending on the perk you choose. If you want to keep your name private, it's not an issue.


Silkscreen poster : get an awesome poster (50 x 70 cm printed on ivory paper 250gr) screen printed by Johan Jaccob. Johan Jaccob is a talented screenprinter. He made some poster for Hellfest and the Queens Of The Stone Age. He's also a member of Glowsun, a stoner rock band. Check out the Graal Seeker poster : 


Silkscreen T-Shirt : get the poster design by Johan Jaccob on a t-shirt! 


Wood carving : exclusive wooden carved Graal by our director/programmer Ludovic Bas. Take the only Graal! 




Easter egg : contribute a hidden text in the game. This text may reference another piece of gaming or movie culture. It can be a reference to history or mythology as well. We will include Easter eggs in some events, item names and places names. This must not be illegal, inappropriate or irrelevant. Keep in mind that the team must approve your idea.
Event idea : an event in the game from your very own idea. This can be any encounter. This must not be illegal, inappropriate or irrelevant. Keep in mind that the team must approve your idea.
Graal idea : an idea for a quest for the Graal! Help us write your very own story for the Graal! This must not be illegal, inappropriate or irrelevant. Keep in mind that the team must approve your idea.

Stretch goals









Risks and challenges
We chose a flexible campaign because it's not an all or nothing campaign. We’ve been working on the project for six months, but we’re in the final stretch now. 
One of our first challenges is to build a strong community around Graal Seeker to help us improve the game even while it's still in development. Making a great game will be another challenge, but we are pretty sure that we can get awesome results with all of you, especially during the alpha and beta phases! Graal Seeker is our first game and this is the main reason why we need support from you more than ever. 
At this point, the risk we still face is in raising the funds we need to hit the release date we aim for in the first quarter of 2015. This campaign will help us get that much closer to sharing those Graal stories with the world.

</div></div>","Who we are...

My name is
Vince and I have been a stay at home dad for the last four years.  A ""remarkable"" experience!  My son James and I used some of this time to
design this innovative new mouse trap. 
Prior to that I was a Quality Engineer in the automotive lighting
business.  

We are running
this campaign in hopes that you can help us finance the next phase of our endeavor,
which includes final designs, prototyping and marketing.  

We do not plan
to manufacture this ourselves, however, we will be submitting licensing
proposals and prototypes to existing pest control device manufacturers. 


We have a robust design.
The Provisional Patent submission
has been made and the design is officially Patent Pending!
The 20 year Utility Patent
submission has been made.
We anticipate the standard 'smoke alarm' version to be sold at retail for $19.95.
We anticipate the 'recessed' version to be sold at retail for $29.95.



This trap:


Is covert and blends into its
environment and goes unseen by the unknowing eye.
They are poison/kill or a
catch/release trap, so it appeals to everyone.
They allow users to do away with
the common snap, glue, poison, and electric traps.
They help prevent the mice from
entering 'your' living space.
They catch mice at a location of 'our' choosing, not the mouse's!
They are simple to install.
They are easy to use, empty and
reset?  
They are meant to be permanent
fixtures designed to blend in to its setting. 
The user never has to look at the
captured mouse if they so choose.
The user no longer has to look at
a gross dead or maimed mouse again.  



Think about
it...

Common
snap, glue, poison, and electric traps are typically placed in our floor
corners and pantries, right?  This is our
living space.  So, why are we
baiting them in the very space we are trying to keep them out of?  By doing this,
we are inviting them in!  Yes, the common
traps work, most of the time, but the mice are still defecating, urinating, and
walking in your living space.  

Our trap design 'stops' them from entering our living space
at all!

If you have
mice, they already have access to your whole house, so you can catch them
anywhere you want if you bait properly and wait.  Our design puts the traps high up on the wall
or ceiling where they are out of the way. Rodents have a basic need to search
for food and this trap draws them in just like any other.  These traps will absolutely attract them and
they will absolutely catch them, too!

With these
funds... 

We plan to use
these funds to further develop the residential designs.  We have two different models.  One looks similar to a standard residential
smoke alarm and the other is recessed, similar to a recessed light.  We need to create working prototypes.

We will also
use these funds to design models meant for use in the commercial
marketplace.  These can be modified to
work just about everywhere.  



They can be used:


In the everyday business.
In food service environments.
In food manufacturing
environments.
In supermarkets and corner
stores.
In hospitals and doctor's
offices.
In schools.
In government buildings.
In all manufacturing plants.
In industrial locations.


Wouldn't you
use these if it meant that you would rarely, if ever, have to buy another trap,
risk injury or look at a disgusting dead mouse again?

We would like
to see these marketed to developers so they can pre-install them in homes.  Mice are inevitable in most parts of the
world.  Why not be
ready for them?

Our
Investment...

We have $15,000
invested in this design and we are out of funds to continue to the prototype
and marketing phase. 

How the funds
will be used:


To purchase one Makerbot 3D
printer
To upgrade our current PC, or
purchase new one if necessary
To purchase 3D Modeling software
To purchase raw materials
To market the trap to the pest
control industry


If we do not
meet our goal...

If we do not
meet our goal, we are planning to stay the course.  We will attempt to find an investor to round
out the remaining funding or begin another campaign.  

Perks...

Our perks range
from $5.00 - $500 and we are offering Amazon Prime gifts.

Amazon Prime
perks:  For example, if you give $10, you
can pick out anything on Amazon Prime under $1.99, and you get a gracious thank

I speak for our whole small indie studio when I say that I'm currently living a life-long dream. I actually make video games for a living! If you could go back and tell my nine-year-old self - who was constantly doodling Super Mario Bros and Sonic the Hedgehog all over ever available scrap of paper - that I would be living this dream, I'm pretty sure his little heart couldn't take it! I have had the privelege of bringing others that shared the same life-long obsession onto my little team and we've been hard at a project that has been truly fulfilling. This dream even has a name: Dungeonforge. Together, we're in the process of making that life-long dream of actually making a game come true.</p><p>Dungeonforge, as I'll explain in full detail a bit further on, is a game about telling your unique story. At it's heart, Dungeonforge is an Action-RPG in the spirit of classic Dungeons and Dragons where you, as dungeon master, drive and shape the gameworld and everyone has a chance to weave their own unique part of gaming lore. As an avid fan of D&amp;D, I can't even begin to express the level of excitement we have to be working on a game that promises that! The gaming community has already expressed a collective excitement about what we're working on by voting Dungeonforge onto Steam Greenlight after less than two weeks on the platform! The outpouring of support has been astounding! We want to deliver on the promise we made by delivering a game that exceeds the expectations of our supporters!<br/><br/>That dream right now is being threatened with being extinguished altogether. Principle members of my team are Chilean nationals and dear friends who were here on student visas while attending BYU, another life-long dream. We have had very little in terms of funding for our project and once the money dried up, they were forced to return to their home country, being unable to afford to stay in school here. Once back at home, they have also had to take on regular work to pay for their living while we continue to develop our game in part-time and with tremendous distance between us. Due to that distance, we've faced delays and setbacks that we hadn't anticipated and development has gone reeling off-schedule. Back states-side, for me it has become impossible to continue development and support my children without taking on more than one job.<br/><br/>So, we're at an impass. Without funding of some kind the dream will be extinguished before it's fully realized. With a small amount of funding, we partially overcome the obstacle of distance with better telepresence software and equipment that will help us be closer as a studio; almost as if we were in the same room.<br/><br/>With a bit more funding, we may even be able to get these guys back to the states, back attending their dream school and back at the studio working all in the same room together again. We may even raise enough to allow us to work full-time, without taking other jobs, and keep our own lights on, rent paid and food on the table while we bring this dream to life.<br/><br/>I'd love to share with you some of the work that we've done and hopefully you can see the extreme levels of love and commitment we've put into every detail of what we've created so far. Read on for a full breakdown of Dungeonforge. Scattered throughout that explanation are a few lovingly crafted screenshots. I regard this as the grown-up version of those Mario doodles that used to make occasional appearance on our families refrigerator when I was kid. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/673449/files/20140624231129-Header_1.png?1403676689"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>In Dungeonforge all the action takes place in a massive, open gameworld. This world is your canvas; the place where you will tell your story as a dungeon master.

Your content then becomes part of the over-arching gameworld for all to enjoy. You can script quests within your adventure for players to complete, or even perform a ""Live Telling"" of your adventure, wherein you actively take the role of dungeon master, playing the part of NPCs, weaving dialog on the fly, and controlling monsters to shape the experience of the players dynamically, in real time. Going further along that theme, we will also feature a competitive, PvDM game type, which will pit the players against the DM, who will be given charge of the hordes of evil in an attempt to thwart the players on their quest.</p><p>Making sure the best content is available and easy to find during online play is important.

We went with a top-down perspective, so the game shares the same simplicity and intuitiveness in the control scheme as games like Diablo. At the same time, we love the engaging, varied combat of games like Dark Souls and The Witcher 2. Thus the combat is driven by timing your mouse clicks to form combos, avoiding taking damage, dodging, parrying and countering enemy attacks, positioning yourself well and waiting for openings to attack. We knew going in, with the idea of a game driven by player-made content, that the gameplay would have to be good enough for people to actually want to make content for our game and play the content others make.

GOING TO HELP CHARITY AND GET A GAME BY SUPPORTING THIS CAMPAIGN: As an incentive to donate to the fourth annual ""24-Hour Game Show Marathon"" which benefits Child's Play, I've assembled 2 unofficial CAH expansions of cards that will humor fans of game shows, from the casual to the hardcore.
One ""Contestants Answering Hosts"" deck will contain 54 total cards (14 prompts and 40 responses) inspired by US game shows and reality shows; the other deck of 18 cards (5 prompts and 13 responses) are about UK game shows.
Warning: Some prompts within each deck have the same level of crudeness as the original CAH game!



4 cards from the US version.


   Big Bucks, no ________! 
FINANCIAL GAIN: I want all profits earned during this Campaign to benefit the charity/marathon.
I have carefully calculated the cost to produce each deck and added approximate shipping costs in order to fulfill all orders so that there will still be a nice chunk of money on each claimed Perk to donate to the charity after the Campaign is completed.
Each deck sold (according to current estimates) will create a donation of approximately $2.

<u style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">Unsere Leidenschaft!</u><br/>
</h2><p>Wir sind begeisterte Kartenspieler! Die Lust auf ein gutes Kartenspiel kann uns jederzeit und überall heimsuchen -  am Abend nach einem stressigen Tag, am Morgen auf dem Weg zur Arbeit oder während einer öden Mittagspause. Ob <b>Skat</b>, <b>Rommé</b>, <b>Doppelkopf</b> oder <b>Canasta</b> - wir mögen Kartenspiele, die unsere Gehirnzellen kitzeln, weniger solche bei denen nur Glück und Zufall über den Spielverlauf entscheiden. Wir wollen in einer angenehmen und freundlichen Spielumgebung spielen, nicht in dunklen Zockerhöhlen und wir wollen unsere Begeisterung mit vielen anderen teilen.</p><h2><u>Warum also ProGames?</u></h2><p>Viele von uns haben einen vollgestopften Alltag inklusive eines stressigen Jobs, familiärer Verpflichtungen und zahlreicher Termine -  da wird die Organisation eines netten Spieleabends mit Freunden schnell zur Herausforderung. Ist das Leben hingegen ‚ein langer ruhiger Fluss‘ und man haust eher abgeschieden, fehlen einem meist die netten Leute, mit denen man sich spontan auf ein gutes Blatt verabreden kann.</p><h2></h2><h2><u>Die gute Nachricht</u></h2><p>Es gibt jede Menge Gleichgesinnte da draußen. Sie mögen sich zwar nicht unbedingt in deiner Nachbarschaft, deinem Land, nicht mal auf deinem Kontinent oder in deiner Zeitzone befinden, aber sie haben mindestens zwei wichtige Dinge mit dir gemein: Sie wollen vielleicht zur selben Zeit Karten spielen wie Du, egal wo sie sich gerade aufhalten und sie haben ein Gerät zur Verfügung, auf dem sie online spielen können.</p><p>Es gibt allerdings noch immer keinen Ort im Web, wo all diese Leute zusammenkommen können um mit- und gegeneinander Karten zu spielen, denn bisher ist es immer noch nicht möglich, auf unterschiedlichen Geräten und Plattformen  online miteinander Karten zu spielen.</p><h2>
<u>Die L</u><u>ö</u><u>sung!</u>
</h2><p>Mit ProGames schaffen wir einen Ort für Strategie-Kartenspiele im Web. <b>ProGames kann von allen mobilen und stationären Geräten, auf allen browserfähigen </b><b>Betriebssystem genutzt werden. </b>So ist es möglich, dass ein Spieler in der kanadischen Wildnis mit seinem iPhone mit einer Spielerin aus Köln, die ein Android Tablet benutzt, und einem Spieler, der zuhause auf der Hallig Hooge am PC sitzt, gemeinsam ein paar Runden Skat kloppen. ProGames wird mit Skat und Rommé starten, gefolgt von Canasta und Doppelkopf. Nach und nach werden weitere beliebte europäische und international erfolgreiche Strategie-Kartenspiele wie Bridge (England), Belote (Frankreich), Chinchón (Spanien) und Briscola (Italien) folgen.</p><p><b>Alle ProGames Kartenspiele sind kostenlos erhältlich - im Web und als App in iTunes, Google Play, im Windows Store und auf Facebook. </b>Du kannst entweder im ‚free-2-play‘ (ohne Geld) oder im ‚play-4-money‘ (um Geld) Modus spielen. Im ‚play-4-money‘ Modus wird um kleine Geldbeträge gespielt -  für uns stehen jedoch das Kartenspiel und der spielerische Wettstreit  im Mittelpunkt - wir wollen unsere Spieler nicht dazu zu animieren, Haus und Hof zu verzocken!</p><h2><u>Wofür wir das Kampagnen-Geld einsetzen</u></h2><p>ProGames ist bereits zu  70% von uns finanziert - um das Projekt erfolgreich an den Start zu bringen, benötigen wir weitere €30.000. Deine Spende soll uns dabei helfen,  einen Teil der Entwicklungskosten und erste Marketing Aktivitäten zu finanzieren. ProGames wird im April 2015 an den Start gehen.</p><h2><u>Das Projekt</u></h2><p>Der Grundstein für unser ProGames Projekt wurde 2009 gelegt. Damals haben wir zwei Kartenspiele-Apps für das iPhone entwickelt: ProSkat and ProRommé.</p><p>Der große Erfolg dieser Apps und die daraus hervorgegangene Gemeinschaft von Spielern haben uns ermutigt, die Spielmöglichkeiten auszubauen und zu erweitern.</p><h4>Das Wichtigste im Überblick:</h4><div>

<p>
</p><p>We love to play cards! Playing in the evening after a busy day, on our way to work or just a few minutes during lunch break. No matter if <b>Rummy</b>, <b>Canasta</b>, <b>Skat</b> or <b>Doppelkopf</b> - we love card games which are easy to access and tickle our brains. We love a pleasant and playful gaming atmosphere - no gambling dungeons. And we love to play with friends and other people who share our enthusiasm.</p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'></span>
<h2><u><b>So why ProGames?</b></u></h2>
<p>Most of us live a strenuous daily routine. A simple
matter such as organizing a cheerful gaming event with friends can be quite a
challenging thing to do. Or our life might be a long and quiet river - but
then we most certainly live somewhere in the countryside where no one is
around to join us and share our spontaneous idea of playing cards.</p>
<p>Here’s the good news: there are a lot of players out there
- they might not live next door, nor in the neighborhood, nor share
the same time zone  - but they have some important things in
common with us: they love to play card games, they want to play no matter when and where and
they want to play on whatever device.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>As of today there is no such place where all these people can join up and play.</p>
<p><b>With ProGames we are creating a cross-platform and multi-device card gaming location where most favored skill card games can be played at any time by you and your friends.</b> First we will launch ProGames featuring four traditional card games such as Rummy, Canasta, Skat and Doppelkopf and as a second step the collection will expand to other popular skill card games such as Bridge, Belote, Chinchón and Briscola. </p>
<p><b>All our card games will be available for free on the Web,  on iTunes, GooglePlay,  in Windows Store and on Facebook. </b>Players can choose between a ‚free-2-play’ and a ‚play-4-money’ mode. The ‚play-4-money’ mode invites users to play for small amounts of money -  at ProGames, our focus is on playing cards and the fun of competition - we do not intend to waste our players’ savings!</p><h2><u>The Budget</u></h2><p>70% of the total development budget for ProGames is financed already and covered by us.  In order to successfully bring the project into the market, we need another €30.000. Your support will allow us to finalize the development and programming and enable us to cover initial marketing expenses.</p><p>The scheduled launch date of ProGames is April 2015.</p><p><u style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 38px; letter-spacing: 1px; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;"">The Project</u></p>
<p></p>
<p>The roots of ProGames were sowed in late 2009 when we published two iOS Apps: ProSkat and ProRummy. The existing community of players and the sustaining success of these two Apps encouraged us to expand to more platforms and to develop more games. </p><h4>ProGames at a glance</h4>

Unsere Leidenschaft!
Wir sind begeisterte Kartenspieler! Die Lust auf ein gutes Kartenspiel kann uns jederzeit und überall heimsuchen -  am Abend nach einem stressigen Tag, am Morgen auf dem Weg zur Arbeit oder während einer öden Mittagspause. Ob Skat, Rommé, Doppelkopf oder Canasta - wir mögen Kartenspiele, die unsere Gehirnzellen kitzeln, weniger solche bei denen nur Glück und Zufall über den Spielverlauf entscheiden. Wir wollen in einer angenehmen und freundlichen Spielumgebung spielen, nicht in dunklen Zockerhöhlen und wir wollen unsere Begeisterung mit vielen anderen teilen.Warum also ProGames?Viele von uns haben einen vollgestopften Alltag inklusive eines stressigen Jobs, familiärer Verpflichtungen und zahlreicher Termine -  da wird die Organisation eines netten Spieleabends mit Freunden schnell zur Herausforderung. Ist das Leben hingegen ‚ein langer ruhiger Fluss‘ und man haust eher abgeschieden, fehlen einem meist die netten Leute, mit denen man sich spontan auf ein gutes Blatt verabreden kann.Die gute NachrichtEs gibt jede Menge Gleichgesinnte da draußen. Sie mögen sich zwar nicht unbedingt in deiner Nachbarschaft, deinem Land, nicht mal auf deinem Kontinent oder in deiner Zeitzone befinden, aber sie haben mindestens zwei wichtige Dinge mit dir gemein: Sie wollen vielleicht zur selben Zeit Karten spielen wie Du, egal wo sie sich gerade aufhalten und sie haben ein Gerät zur Verfügung, auf dem sie online spielen können.Es gibt allerdings noch immer keinen Ort im Web, wo all diese Leute zusammenkommen können um mit- und gegeneinander Karten zu spielen, denn bisher ist es immer noch nicht möglich, auf unterschiedlichen Geräten und Plattformen  online miteinander Karten zu spielen.
Die Lösung!
Mit ProGames schaffen wir einen Ort für Strategie-Kartenspiele im Web. ProGames kann von allen mobilen und stationären Geräten, auf allen browserfähigen Betriebssystem genutzt werden. So ist es möglich, dass ein Spieler in der kanadischen Wildnis mit seinem iPhone mit einer Spielerin aus Köln, die ein Android Tablet benutzt, und einem Spieler, der zuhause auf der Hallig Hooge am PC sitzt, gemeinsam ein paar Runden Skat kloppen. ProGames wird mit Skat und Rommé starten, gefolgt von Canasta und Doppelkopf. Nach und nach werden weitere beliebte europäische und international erfolgreiche Strategie-Kartenspiele wie Bridge (England), Belote (Frankreich), Chinchón (Spanien) und Briscola (Italien) folgen.Alle ProGames Kartenspiele sind kostenlos erhältlich - im Web und als App in iTunes, Google Play, im Windows Store und auf Facebook. Du kannst entweder im ‚free-2-play‘ (ohne Geld) oder im ‚play-4-money‘ (um Geld) Modus spielen. Im ‚play-4-money‘ Modus wird um kleine Geldbeträge gespielt -  für uns stehen jedoch das Kartenspiel und der spielerische Wettstreit  im Mittelpunkt - wir wollen unsere Spieler nicht dazu zu animieren, Haus und Hof zu verzocken!Wofür wir das Kampagnen-Geld einsetzenProGames ist bereits zu  70% von uns finanziert - um das Projekt erfolgreich an den Start zu bringen, benötigen wir weitere €30.000. Deine Spende soll uns dabei helfen,  einen Teil der Entwicklungskosten und erste Marketing Aktivitäten zu finanzieren. ProGames wird im April 2015 an den Start gehen.Das ProjektDer Grundstein für unser ProGames Projekt wurde 2009 gelegt. Damals haben wir zwei Kartenspiele-Apps für das iPhone entwickelt: ProSkat and ProRommé.Der große Erfolg dieser Apps und die daraus hervorgegangene Gemeinschaft von Spielern haben uns ermutigt, die Spielmöglichkeiten auszubauen und zu erweitern.Das Wichtigste im Überblick:



ProGames ist kostenlos und alle Kartenspiele können um Punkte und
Ranglistenplätze gespielt werden. Die Kosten für Aktualisierungen,
Kundenbetreuung und den täglichen Betrieb von ProGames werden durch den
seriösen und sicheren ‚play-4-money‘ Bereich finanziert, wo  Spieler
rundenbasierte Kartenspiele für kleine Geldbeträge spielen können.


ProGames ist kein Ort für Glücksspieler und Zocker. Wir legen sehr viel
Wert auf eine freundliche und sichere Spielumgebung, in der man sich wohlfühlen
und auf das Kartenspiel konzentrieren kann. Wir ermutigen unsere Spieler, den
kostenlosen ‚free-2-play‘ Bereich zu besuchen und ausgiebig zu nutzen.


Alle auf ProGames verfügbaren Kartenspiele können auf iOS, Android, Win/MAC
und Facebook miteinander gespielt werden. Spieler können dazu mobile Geräte wie
Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops oder auch einen stationären Computer nutzen.
Einzige Voraussetzung ist eine funktionierende Internetverbindung.


Für uns stehen beliebte, strategische  Kartenspiele im Mittelpunkt -
unser Fokus liegt auf dem Gameplay und dem spielerischen Wettstreit.

Der Zahlungsverkehr wird von einem international zertifizierten und seriösen Payment Provider abgewickelt. Der Gewinner einer Spielrunde erhält sein Preisgeld sehr schnell ausgezahlt - in der Regel innerhalb eines Werktages.Beispiel ProSkat - Play-4-Money - Regelsets wählen (in Arbeit)

We love to play cards! Playing in the evening after a busy day, on our way to work or just a few minutes during lunch break. No matter if Rummy, Canasta, Skat or Doppelkopf - we love card games which are easy to access and tickle our brains. We love a pleasant and playful gaming atmosphere - no gambling dungeons. And we love to play with friends and other people who share our enthusiasm.
So why ProGames?
Most of us live a strenuous daily routine. A simple
matter such as organizing a cheerful gaming event with friends can be quite a
challenging thing to do. Or our life might be a long and quiet river - but
then we most certainly live somewhere in the countryside where no one is
around to join us and share our spontaneous idea of playing cards.
Here’s the good news: there are a lot of players out there
- they might not live next door, nor in the neighborhood, nor share
the same time zone  - but they have some important things in
common with us: they love to play card games, they want to play no matter when and where and
they want to play on whatever device.  

As of today there is no such place where all these people can join up and play.
With ProGames we are creating a cross-platform and multi-device card gaming location where most favored skill card games can be played at any time by you and your friends. First we will launch ProGames featuring four traditional card games such as Rummy, Canasta, Skat and Doppelkopf and as a second step the collection will expand to other popular skill card games such as Bridge, Belote, Chinchón and Briscola. 
All our card games will be available for free on the Web,  on iTunes, GooglePlay,  in Windows Store and on Facebook. Players can choose between a ‚free-2-play’ and a ‚play-4-money’ mode. The ‚play-4-money’ mode invites users to play for small amounts of money -  at ProGames, our focus is on playing cards and the fun of competition - we do not intend to waste our players’ savings!The Budget70% of the total development budget for ProGames is financed already and covered by us.  In order to successfully bring the project into the market, we need another €30.000. Your support will allow us to finalize the development and programming and enable us to cover initial marketing expenses.The scheduled launch date of ProGames is April 2015.The Project

The roots of ProGames were sowed in late 2009 when we published two iOS Apps: ProSkat and ProRummy. The existing community of players and the sustaining success of these two Apps encouraged us to expand to more platforms and to develop more games. ProGames at a glance

ProGames card games can be played cross-platform on iOS, Android, Win/MAC and Facebook 

ProGames card games can be played on any device that has an internet connection such as smartphones, tablets, computers and laptops. 


ProGames' focus  is on the card games and the fun of playing.


ProGames applications are for free. But of course we need to make some money to run ProGames, make progress in development, provide updates and customers services. That’s why a safe and serious ‚play-4-money‘ area will be available - where you can play turn-based games for small amounts of money. 

ProGames provides a cheerful and safe atmosphere where players feel comfortable and enjoy playing cards 

ProGames is not a place for gamblers or cheaters.

Minecraft Blueprint is a upcoming website based off www.minedraft.net. This website plans to improve the existing websites and programs out there to make mock up designs of your creations.

Why Re-Invent Something already out there?

After using a few similar websites and programs out there I have found areas that lack in functionality and that are not easy on the eye. I aim to fix this.

What will be different about Minecraft Blueprint?

Minecraft Blueprint will be built from the ground up and be a web based application within the Minecraft Blueprint website (to be announced). With this application being build from scratch means I can add nearly any features I can think of, including suggestions from you the PMC community.

What are some Features Minecraft BluePrints will offer?

- Save your Blueprint as a jpg or png file to your computer
- Save Projects for Later editing
- Share your Blueprint creations with an online community
- Make your Blueprint with Popular Texture Packs (eventually able to upload your own)
- Multiple Views
- Smooth User Interface
- Almost Unlimited Blueprint work area
- 16x16, 32x32 and 64x64 views of ALL Minecraft blocks
- Mob Icons for mob trap planning
- Much much more...

Possible Features:
- Create Accounts
- Share projects with comments like PMC

When will this be ready for testing / use?

Currently this is in the Planning and Design phase, I am creating the UI designs and mapping how the whole program will work so currently there is no ETA for this project.
 
Why do I need Funding?
 
The reason I need funding for this project is that I dont have ALL the knowledge coding wise to create a smooth running application in a reasonable time. This means i will be hiring a external developer to help with the creation of the project for parts of the coding that are beyond my knowledge.
 
Along with this the excess funds will go towards advertising, website hosting costs and general project expenses.

[Viva, Bacon!] is a 2D sideview action adventure game for PC(Windows, OSX) and mobile(Android, iOS) platform.
     





Players should explore 10 strange, new worlds in order to chase the unknown thieves who have stolen some of the food in your fridge(especially bacon!). The main character can gain stamina -which constantly decrease - by eating the food the thieves have dropped.      



     



The strange worlds are NOT kind at all. The main character will be continuously distracted by the surrounding environment, or might even end up in a blocked way. If he can't proceed any further, he should find someone who can help him. That 'someone' will be willing to help the character, if the players do him/her a favor.  





[Viva, Bacon!] has simple and straight forward interface for both of PC and mobile environment. Players won't have to think over which key to press in order for character to take certain action. 
Also, we are trying to impress the players with all of the hand-drawn background image, platform artwork, and character animation.








 
Below is a schedule for game production. 



For the prototype and beta version for free distribution, players will be able to play only the first world.

Boasting one of the earliest uses of procedurally-generated content in a computer game, Hunter's Moon pushed the boundaries of the genre and helped redefine what a shoot 'em up could be.Hunter's Moon Remastered will be the first release from the Thalamus Remastered collection, which will feature cartridge versions of classic Thalamus games tweaked and updated in various ways. These remastered editions will come in cartridge format and boast numerous enhancements and exciting new features.We believe there is a community of fans who share a love for this seminal retro shoot 'em up, and with your help we can bring the concept to fruition. We also believe in giving back, and in this regard 25% of the proceeds from each game goes directly to the original developers. If you're a TL;DR kind of person and like to cut to the chase, here's the basics:
Browse the Perks on the right to find a perk that's right for you.
Click on your chosen perk to purchase it.
If you want to order multiple items, simply purchase multiple perks.
Sit back and relax - we'll handle the rest!
 We've tried to create a series of perks to accommodate as many different preferences as possible - we want you to be able to choose the extras you really want without being restricted to a specific perk. You can purchase as many perks and extras as you wish, as many times as you wish. However, please read the perk descriptions carefully to avoid purchasing duplicate items!The game is available in five different versions:
Digital Edition [£15]
Physical Edition [£40]
Physical (Karma) Edition [£45]
Physical & Digital Edition [£50]
Signed Copy [£50]
Note: All versions of the game include a free copy of the 'Thirty One' digital album (scroll down the page for more information). All physical versions of the game will also include a slick outer sleeve and a free Thalamus bookmark and sticker.Additionally, there are a number of different extras which you can also purchase:

T-Shirt Perk [£85]
Slippytee Perk [£85]

Note: All of the premium perks include a discount on the regular prices. After flying your trusty ship Hunter too close to a black hole, you find yourself lost in space on the wrong side of the galaxy, surrounded by sprawling, hive-like cities. At the core of each city lie mysterious alien starcells – these contain valuable navigational data, and must be collected in order to plot a course back home to Hunter's Moon.The aim of each level is to blast through the hive and grab the starcells, a task made more challenging by the invincible white worker cells which endlessly patrol the cities repairing any damage inflicted. These workers also bring the hive's defenses to life, causing them to spew deadly spores that can only be resisted by using your ship's trusty Perma-Shields.The game features 128 levels spread across 16 star systems. When all the starcells on a level have been collected you'll enter the bonus game where you can earn a perma-shield and an extra life. You must complete every level within each star system to advance to the next; however, should you manage to collect four flashing starcells before the time limit expires you'll automatically jump to the next system.As you progress through the different star systems you'll encounter an array of diverse and challenging hive types, including Attackers that throw out deadly spores, Wormcells that roam freely in space, Darkcells which are only visible on radar, Stargates requiring precision timing to navigate, and Switchers that change direction without warning. Do you have the dexterity and psychopathic blasting skills to find your way home to Hunter's Moon...? The premise behind Hunter's Moon Remastered is to not only re-release the game on cartridge, but also add new content, levels, music, and graphics, as well as make various tweaks, bug fixes, and improvements. And naturally, we want to create something which is luxuriously packaged and looks great on a shelf next to a string of Thalamus Remastered games.
New Levels: We've reverse-engineered the game to find out how the procedurally-generated levels were created, allowing us to add more levels and Star Systems (including new levels from the game's creator, Martin Walker!).
Graphical Tweaks: We'll be adding a new logo on the Title Screen, thicker lasers for the Hunter, and hopefully some extra layers of parallax on the in-game starfield.
New Packaging: The cartridge will be housed in a sturdy clamshell case, complete with an updated A6 instruction manual, cover art postcard, and Thalamus sticker.
New Cover Art: The game will boast remastered cover artwork by legendary illustrator Oliver Frey, based on his Zzap!64 cover from 1987.
New 'Loading' Screen: We'll be employing the exemplary pixel-bashing skills of legendary C64 artist Robin Levy to translate Oli Frey's new cover artwork to the C64.
In-Game Music: You'll be able to choose between in-game music or sound effects on the Title Screen. The game will also feature brand new music from composer Matt Gray.
Hint Pages: If you're new to Hunter's Moon, don't worry - we'll be adding hint pages to the game’s front end which will cover the fundamental basics of playing the game.
Trainer Mode: If the thought of conquering 128+ levels fills you with dread, we'll give you infinite lives, infinite perma-shields, and a shortcut to the first eight star systems.
Saving & Passwords: As well as a save feature which saves your progress directly to the cartridge, we'll include a password system that jumps to the Star System of your choice.
Gameplay Tweaks: We'll make a few judicious tweaks wherever necessary; let's face it, wouldn't it be great if those Perma-Shields lasted just a little bit longer?
Demo Mode: We'll add a rolling demo to the game's attract mode, which will show tantalizing glimpses of some of the game's 128+ levels.
Bug Fixes: Games often have their bugs, and Hunter's Moon is no exception; we'll use this valuable opportunity to address some of the minor bugs in the game.
Localised Text: As a treat for our European cousins, we'll be translating all of the in-game text into French, Italian, German, and Spanish.
Original Version: For all of you die-hard Hunter's Moon purists still wearing shoulder pads and living in 1987, we'll include the original version of the game on the cartridge.
Boot Menu: We'll add a boot menu which will allow you to choose the version (Original or Remastered), activate the Trainer, select a language, and access the Level Editor.
Expanded High Score Table: We’ll be expanding the High Score Table to include five high scores instead of four. No longer will 4th place be the ultimate humiliation! Thanks to the success of our original crowdfunding campaign, we were able to smash through our funding goal and add a plethora of extras to the game:
NTSC Compatibility: We'll be performing various optimisations to the game engine to ensure the game is fully compatible with NTSC (North American) C64s.NTSC version (left) versus the PAL version (right) 
New Music: Matt Gray will be creating some brand-new SID tracks for the game, designed to perfectly compliment his original Hunter's Moon soundtrack.
New Level Types: We'll be adding three new level types (Jumpgates, Infrared, and Emperor Hives), as well as new level designs by Martin Walker himself!
Random Mode: We'll add add a new mode to the game which randomly shuffles the level order; even if you're an experienced player, you'll never quite know what's coming next!
Level Editor: We'll add our Level Editor to the cartridge, allowing you to create your own devilishly tricky alien hives and share them with your friends!
Packaging Upgrade: This goal allowed us to add a glossy cardboard sleeve that neatly slides over the top of the clamshell case. Trust us, it's lusher than lush.
New Intro: We're employing the graphical talents of Robin Levy to help us create an intro which sets the perfect mood and tone for the action that lies ahead.
Manual Illustrations: As we're revamping the instruction manual, we'll  be commissioning Oli Frey to create some new illustrations to dot throughout the text.
New Outro: To compliment the new Intro Sequence, we'll also be revamping the outro sequence (which will now also include all of our wonderful backers' names).
Walker's Warbles PDF: This exclusive feature is Martin's personal retrospective of his career as a video game musician, including his inspirations and favourite compositions.
Localised Manual: As well as in-game text translations, we'll also be translating the instruction manual into French, Italian, German, and Spanish.
Bookmark & Sticker: A last-minute addition to the Stretch Goals, we'll also be adding a Thalamus bookmark and sticker to each physical copy of the game.All versions of the game will include a free copy of Thirty One, an 11-track digital compilation album featuring some of the best Thalamus remixes from C64audio.com's catalogue (including the eagerly-awaited Sidologie). We've also included two tracks from Matt Gray's forthcoming Reformation album, including that killer track from the campaign video!The current track list includes:

Sanxion - Slow Poison (Karma 64)


Delta 97 Plus - Chris Abbott & Rob Hubbard (Back in Time)


QueDex Loading Theme - Matt Gray (Reformation)


Hunter's Moon Loading Theme - Matt Gray (Reformation)


Armalyte Asteroid Storm - Fabian Del Priore feat. Puffy64 (Back in Time 3)


Sanxion - Erwin ""Tron"" Beekveld (Syntax Era - Remix64 Volume 3)


Hunter's Moon - Marcel Donne (Waiting for SID)


Sanxion - Markus ""Makke"" Lagre (It's Binary, Baby)


Delta Victory - Marcel Donne (Waiting for SID)


Thalamusik 2000 - Chris Abbott (Back in Time 2)

Special thanks to Chris Abbott from C64audio.com and Matt Gray for their incredible support in making this album possible. Thanks to the success of the initial crowdfunding campaign, development has already commenced. The estimated completion date is end of February 2018, with orders ready for dispatch in late March 2018. Thalamus Digital Publishing is an independent UK game developer and publisher specializing in high-quality retro games. Our team of dedicated professionals have decades of experience, and have collectively worked on over 160 titles for a variety of world-class companies.
Andy Roberts [Designer / Producer] Andy has worked in the games industry since 1989; cutting his teeth on Zzap!64 magazine, he went on to freelance for numerous publications including Commodore Format. He also worked on three of the most successful C64 games of all time: Creatures, Creatures 2, and Mayhem in Monsterland.
Dan Hotop [Programming] Dan is an experienced programmer hailing from New South Wales, Australia. After graduating with a Bachelor of Computer Science (Games Tech), he went on to join Sony Computer Entertainment, working on various PSP, PS2, and PS3 titles such as MediEvil: Resurrection, Heavenly Sword, and LittleBigPlanet.
Rob Levy [Graphics] An accomplished artist and animator, Rob began his career as one third of the legendary Cyberdyne Systems, who created the spectacular C64 shoot 'em up Armalyte. As well as contributions to games such as Hunter's Moon, Hawkeye, and Citadel, Rob also worked for System 3, producing visuals for Last Ninja 3 and Turbo Charge.
Matt Gray [Music] Matt began his career in 1987 with his high-energy tracks for QueDex. He went on to produce music for games such as Driller and Hunter's Moon, which led to Matt joining System 3, where he produced audio for Bangkok Knights, Dominator, Tusker, Vendetta, and his much-lauded soundtrack for Last Ninja 2. Order fulfillment will be handled by RGCD, who have been publishing, and distributing C64 cartridge games since 2011. RGCD’s expertise and attention to detail will ensure that every order is handled with the utmost care and professionalism. After market retail sales will be handled by Protovision. Founded in 1996, Protovision is one of the world’s leading suppliers of new C64 hardware and software, and is the exclusive after market retailer for Thalamus Digital Publishing. Physical copies of the game will be dispatched in a sturdy A4 postal box capable of a copy of the game, a rolled A3 poster, and numerous extras (this allows us to combine multiple items into one box). Depending on the item, miscellaneous extras will be dispatched in A4 postal boxes or padded envelopes. Posters will be included in the A4 box wherever possible, or shipped separately in a sturdy cardboard tube.Basic postage rates for physical game pledges are as follows:
United Kingdom - £4.00
European Union - £8.00
Rest of World - £12.00
For all other extras, the postage is included in the price (see individual perks for details).Note: Some premium (£75+) perks have a slightly higher postage rate due to the size, weight, or quantity of the rewards.All packages will be sent via Royal Mail UK Standard Delivery or International Standard Delivery, which includes £25 coverage. If you wish to upgrade your postage method to UK Signed or International Tracked & Signed, please contact us at: postage@thalamusdigital.co.uk for a quote. Creating and publishing computer games can be a huge challenge. However, as a game designer and producer well experienced in managing video game projects of varying scope and complexity, I am more than qualified to deliver this project to a high standard.I have over 27 years' experience in the games industry, having worked on 80+ games across 20 different formats. In 1993 I helped publish the classic C64 game Mayhem in Monsterland, including duplication, packaging design and print, advertising, localization, and order fulfillment.The development process is something I have absolute confidence in; the project has been in the planning stages since late 2014, and I've already invested hundreds of man hours to mitigate as many risks as possible:I've consulted with some incredible advisors, including Sam Dyer of Bitmap Books, Chris Abbott of C64audio.com, and James Monkman of RGCD.I've worked tirelessly to try and source rewards from trusted, quality suppliers and manufacturers, as well as backup suppliers should any unexpected issues occur.Certainly, it's a logistical challenge to bring this many moving parts together to deliver a final product, and it would be foolish to suggest that everything will run without a hitch. However, the team is ready, we've done the preliminary R&D, and I'm confident that any problems that arise from this point on would merely cause a delay.And if delays do occur, naturally you'll be the first to know: one of my promises to you the backers is that you'll receive regular, weekly updates direct to your inbox. No surprises, and no radio silence – I'll keep you in the loop every step of the way.If you have any further questions, please get in touch.Andy Roberts andy@thalamusdigital.co.ukWeb: www.thalamusdigital.co.uk Facebook: www.facebook.com/thalamusdigital Twitter: @thalamusdigital Instagram: @thalamusdigital ​Special Thanks: Chris Abbott, Jim Brain, Ste Day, Sam Dyer, Oli Frey, Matt Gray, Neil Grayson, Mark Hardisty, Dan Hotop, Roger Kean, Rob Levy, Jason Mackenzie, Carl Mason, Marty Millar, James Monkman, Paul Morrison, Mat Recardo, Jennifer Roberts, Jens Schönfeld, Trevor Storey, Stephen Thomson, Johan Vinet, Jakob Voos, Martin Walker, The Commodore Format Archive, The Retro Hour Podcast, Retro Domination Podcast, Retro Asylum Podcast, Stirring Dragon Games, One More Story Games, and Retro Gamer. Additional thanks to Gary Winnick & Ron Gilbert for the Karma Pledge idea.Hunter's Moon & Mugician artwork © 1986-2017 Oliver Frey.Thalamus logo © 1986-2017 Oliver Frey.

<p class=""p1"">OmuniOnline, A Fantasy based MMO RPG with a twist. The Idea of this project Is actually based in the future yet it is still displayed as the fantasy medieval era. You play the roll of one of the ""Soul Children"" witch essentially is just a person who was born with a bit of a destroyed god's power imbedded in a distant relative then passed into you when you where in the womb. You get to completely customize your character then enter this diverse and beautiful world to either play the main story or just do what ever you want. The freedom is yours. The combat is completely unique and actually relies on your skill as a player. This will not be a point click, and wait fighting style, You will need to attack, dodge, block, etc all on your own in real time. You have numerous stats for you to train in order to grow your character's abilities. These skill will of course include: attack,strength,defense, range, magic, wood cutting, mining, smithing, agility, health, cooking, fishing, etc. We will display these skill in a unique way and make sure that they are all enjoyable to train and use throughout the game. There will be many items and themes that involve futuristic technology to add the twist in the game for example ""hover boards"". The monsters in this game will be very diverse and will prove to be challenging and entertaining to fight. Weapons and armor are completely interchangeable as you are able to select five different main armor pieces add jewelry, capes, shields, and weapons, All of these will be able to switch and customize to make your perfect armor set. In order to obtain armor you can either buy it but in most cases you will need to pay and give the needed materials to a black smith. Blacksmiths will allow u to use less materials but will cost however if you have a high enough smithing level you may make your armor alone with the cost of more materials and no capital.</p>

<p class=""p1"">2. GAME CONCEPT</p>
<p class=""p1"">Back many years ago people worshiped gods and expressed their religion and faith. There where eight Gods in total four good and four that ended up being evil. Omuna, Shinya, Kyo, Darma who were the good gods and Omuni, Ruge, Punisher, Shento who were the evil. In the beginning all was great. The eight gods created a Demi god named Gaia who took the form of the earth the humans lived on, but then eventually the four evil gods started abusing the humans as they worshiped them instead of answering their prayers. Eventually they started to even kill the humans, Omuna the goddess of light and sister to Omuni the god of darkness, decided to punish the four evil gods by banishing them forever. Thousands of years have passed and the humans have advanced in technology and have forgotten about their magic and their religions, thus resulting in the humans poisoning gaia with pollution and side effects from their ways. The good gods did not want this to happen and could not stop it on their own so they summoned the four evil gods asking them to help. Instead of helping they actually started destroying every human and started to summon all kinds of grotesque monsters to cause chaos. The four evil god then took their revenge on the four good gods and ended up destroying them. Omuna, just before dying let her soul and pour flood into gaia so gaia could imbed Omuna's power in some of the surviving and hiding humans. Many years passed and the evil gods decided to take a long rest thinking that they destroyed all humans Unfortunately for the gods many humans were surviving just fine underground and when they noticed that the gods where sleeping they evacuated the hiding caverns to start rebuilding and repopulating. Thousands of years have passed and kingdoms, villages, bridges, etc have been created with just the materials found on gaia. You are then born with a fragment of Omuna's soul inside of you. Some more years skip and you decide to go adventure but when you do a strange old man speaks to you telling you who you are. He then trains you on how to survive in this world and become stronger because you are destined to find the other people with fragments of Omuna's soul and unite to slay the four evil gods when they wake.    </p>

<p>Read <a href=""http://www.suntimes.com/business/16684011-420/evanston-entrepreneurs-mercy-card-helps-the-needy.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this article from the Chicago Sun-Times</a> that provides great background on Mercy Cards.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Do handouts benefit the homeless?  This is a much debated question that most people struggle with every time they are asked for a handout.  Nonetheless, most people eventually relent.  However, even when we give, the main reservation that one has is that once we are relieved of our cash, there is no way to ensure responsible use of those funds. </p>
<p>Jed JohnHope and Shantel Higgins began developing Mercy Cards as second-year MBA students at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. After a visit to a Chicago-area grocery store that had several homeless people outside, Jed began to contemplate the homeless population’s diminishing access to cash. Convinced that we could help, Jed and Shantel started Mercy Cards and proceeded to dedicate their careers to this problem that is well worth solving.</p>
In short, Mercy Cards is seeking to revolutionize the way that we give to homeless.  We urge you to help us, but <strong>we don't need coins, we need CHANGE!<br/></strong><br/><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our mission is to create technological solutions that allow eager citizens to contribute to those less fortunate and manage those contributions to ensure that they are not spent on abusive substances.  By doing so, we will reduce the homeless’ access to drugs and alcohol and increase their ability to achieve employment and get off the streets.</p>
<p>Breaking bread with your neighbor was once commonplace and helping those in need went well beyond one’s own dinner table, but in today’s world social circles have become smaller and most people have become complacent to the plight of the homeless.  In fact, most people rationalize this complacency with the two following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>No Change</strong> – Donors, simply, do not carry cash anymore and change is a byproduct of cash</li>
<li>
<strong>No Trust</strong> – While everyone is eager to buy someone a meal, most donors were concerned with giving someone money to support a substance abuse habit</li>
</ul>
Mercy Cards will directly address both concerns and provide a way for everyone to play an active role in <strong>helping their neighbors help themselves</strong>.  The main advantage to the homeless population is decreased access to drugs and alcohol.  38% of the homeless are dependent on alcohol and 26% are dependent on drugs.  Most astonishing is the fact that these people depend on you for income.  So, essentially, the homeless population are victims of our generosity and by limiting the homeless’ access to traditional cash, a universal currency, we can help them become vibrant, productive members of our community again.</div>
<div>
<br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Mercy Cards is raising $75,000 for our first production run.  We have identified a company to design the custom, electronic filter and produce the cards.  The minimum initial order quantity is 10,000 units and we need your backing! If we do not reach our intended goal, we will continue to seek creative ways to bring this, or similar, products to market.</p>
<p>As an initial backer of Mercy Cards, you will receive a collector's edition, 1st production run card. Once Mercy Cards has become a resounding success, you will share in our joy, knowing that you help us start and, together, we have made a lasting impact on the way that the world gives to the needy.  The commemorative Mercy Card will be a lasting token of our gratitude and a keepsake that one can cherish forever.</p>

<p>The story starts off before the Occupation of France by Nazi Germany. The player is introduced to the main character, a Jewish boy named Samuel who is playing with his friends, going to school, and living a normal life in Paris. However, when France is invaded by the Nazis, Samuel and his family are soon forced to wear the yellow star of David on their clothes.</p>
<p>The scene changes to the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, the mass arrest of Jews in Paris that took place on July 16, 1942. During the chaos Samuel's mother tells him to escape the city. She takes off his star so he can't be recognized as a Jew, and gives him the address of a Catholic priest who can help him escape Paris and the occupied part of France. As Samuel escapes, his mother is spotted and killed as he is able to escape.</p>
<p>Samuel starts his journey to find the priest, sneaking his way through Paris. Samuel soon finds him, and is smuggled out to southern France. They arrive at a small village hidden in a forest, where the villagers are passing off Jewish children from all over France as Christian orphans, and soon Samuel meets a fox who tells him that if he helps her he will be able to see his mother again.</p>

The world of Contagion is a dark and terrifying 
place. On the surface it is no different than the world you and I live 
in. Most people go on about their lives never realizing the terrors that
 walk among them.Despite humanity’s vast ignorance, the horrors are 
there. Angels and demons make war in the shadows. Hellspawn serve their 
demonic masters. Ancient gods, once imprisoned in a dark realm called Oblitus, now walk the Earth, seeking followers to help regain their former glory.
There's a war in the shadows....but for how much longer?

Rise of the Ilu
Rise of the Ilu is a 192-page supplement for the Contagion Second Edition Role-Playing Game published by Aegis Studios. This full-color supplement will include rules for playing members of the Ilu race, or as humans call them: gods. Whether a Gamemaster wishes to introduce the Ilu as a shadowy threat in the background, or run a campaign in which players assume the roles of these ancient deities, Rise of the Ilu includes everything you need to take your Contagion Second Edition campaign to a celestial level!
 Rise of the Ilu contains: 
Two new playable races: the celestial Ilu and their half-mortal children, the Ikkibu. A dozen new feats for celestial characters
 Fifty new spells unveiling the cosmic power of the Ilu.

In 2013, we came here, to IndieGoGo, to ask for YOUR help in making the Contagion Second Edition Corebook happen. Through your support, we were able to complete that project and it has gone on to be the MOST SUCCESSFUL BOOK Aegis Studios has EVER released!So we are back here asking you to help us do it again. Rise of the Ilu is an ambitious project and we want to craft the highest quality book for our players and fans. Your support, whether by pre-ordering the book here, donating just a single dollar, or even simply sharing the campaign link on your social media, can help us turn this ambition into reality. 
  What We Need & What You Get Our basic goal will go towards acquiring a few key elements we need in order to make Rise of the Ilu a success. Your support will go toward: 
Hiring freelance writers to flesh out the world of the Ilu.
 Acquiring quality art for the full-color interior of the book. 
 Providing print copies to our backers.

Which brings us to the REALLY fun part: the perks!
We are offering a wide range of perks for your support. Through this campaign, you can acquire digital or print copies of existing Contagion Second Edition products at discount prices, a game session run by Contagion developer Travis Legge via Skype or Google Hangouts, signed print bundles of Contagion products, the Contagion Second Edition Print Omnibus, which collects various supplements that have previously been digital-only releases and is available ONLY to backers on our crowdfunding projects, and much much more!

For full details be sure to check out the perks section of the page, and do not hesitate to contact us with any questions!We will also be unveiling new stretch goals once we meet the base goal! Help us get there!
PLEASE NOTE: Perks are not cumulative, and only include the items listed in each individual perk. Please double-check to ensure you are receiving the perk you want. 

  The Impact Your support with this project will help us bring a quality product to our fans. By sharing this project, you just might introduce someone new to tabletop role-playing, modern horror storytelling or the urban fantasy genre. Every dollar helps us make a better product and YOUR support makes all the difference in the world to us. We've been down this road before with the Contagion Second Edition Corebook, which turned out beautifully! We can do it again, with your help!
  Risks & Challenges  The majority of the system development for Rise of the Ilu is complete. The risk factor for supporting this endeavor is very low. Whether we only raise a dollar, or if we raise 10 TIMES our base goal, this book will come out. We will keep our backers updated on the progress as the book comes together. Based on previous publishing experience, I believe we have set our delivery dates far enough out to give us significant time to wrap up production and get the books delivered ON TIME!

</div></div>","A group of monsters gather around the table to play their favorite game: “Voodoo Madness”. They set up a table with six voodoo dolls, each linked to a different monster.Each player plays as a voodoo doll. Your goal is to reveal the identities of your opponents, or destroy them before they reveal yours.Voodoo dolls target each other with object cards. Each object in the game is linked to a particular monster’s weakness. The last unidentified voodoo doll standing wins the game!



































Around 4.5% of people are colorblind, we added some symbols to the object cards that will help them have a guide.

Risks and challenges
Fulfillment: Fulfillment can be a frightening prospect for a first-timer. That’s why we asked for help from experienced and successful developers on this site. This is what turned us on to the “China method” (Shipping directly from china to fulfillment centers around the world).
Our method is not new and has been used successfully by other developers. Our fulfillment company has the experience to deliver your games, and just to be sure, we will have some backups to ensure 100% fulfillment!
Finally, we are keeping the rewards simple. We do not want to take more time than necessary to complete the shipping. We want you to get the game as soon as possible!
Manufacturing: Our manufacturer, WinGo Games, has extensive experience in game manufacturing. They are also close in proximity and friendly with our fulfillment company, which will ensure a smooth and fast fulfillment once our games leave the factory.
Game design & Art: Design and art are 100% complete for the basic game. This means we are saving as much time as we can and you won’t have to wait long for your game! We are in the manufacturing process already!",43.0,6,"1 Campaign

<p>World of Midgard offers rich, amazing, full 3D fantasy world, together with full support for factions conflict, factions battleground, rated arenas, 10-man raiding system, and more.</p>
<p>On plot level, World of Midgard focuses on a conflict between the two warring faction, the Alliance and the Fury, the struggle between them, and also their fight against a common enemy, the Swarm.</p>
<p>The game has a deeply immersing lore, which tells the story of the past of World of Midgard’s heroes, the battles they fought, and the tale of the Schism, the Swarm, Survival &amp; Conquest, and the Treaty of the Fallen Oak.

<p>During your journey through the game’s world you will immerse yourself in a world inspired by Norse mythology. There are 6 playable character races: Human, Elf, and Dwarf belonging to the Alliance, and Orc, Dark Elf, and Blood Drak belonging to the Fury. In addition to selecting a race, you can choose from 5 different classes, which represent a unique style of the particular player.</p>
<p>The classes are: Confessors, Fighter, Mage, Rogues, and Templar. We plan to add a Ranger class next year, but your help can make it possible much faster. The game world is already huge, but it will grow even bigger with each content update -meaning  more quests, more zones, more dungeons, more mounts and more kick-ass gear sets.</p>
<p>And, have I mentioned that while the whole leveling game play is fun, and includes hundreds of quests in open world, solo dungeons and 5-man dungeon leveling system, the game really focuses on end of the game experience?

We plan to have 512x512 textures on newer tablets with possibility to have full 1024x1024 for top end 9+ inch tablets (like new iPad or coming Google Nexus 10)
 

What do we need the money for?
We started on HD textures but cost is to big for us to make all of them.
We need to hire graphics designer to make those HD testures.

<p><i>Community -</i> This game has been a great example of our mission as a fledgling company put into action: bringing people together with board games.  So many people have contributed ideas, art, and blood, sweat and tears to this game.  And it shows!  One of the most common comments, in fact, was gratitude for the way community was prioritized over competition or pride in the first Kickstarter campaign. <i>(first Kickstarter? see Q&amp;A below).</i><br/></p>
<p><i>Tower Defense -</i> There are many ""Tower Defense"" board games on the market.  But in the words of Rahdo, a professional non-paid reviewer:</p>
<blockquote> ""I don't think that there is any other Tower Defense game besides 
The King's Armory, that so closely emulates the game play of a straight 
up flash-based computer tower defense game.  I mean this game really 
does have it all!""  <br/>
</blockquote>
<p>  So, for the millions of people that enjoy online ""TD"" games, we are the first to bring a true re-creation, and fully playable version, of that to the board game table.  And now you get to take credit for it also.</p>
<p><i>Game Genre Shift -</i> Why not just play TD online?  Here are our answers.</p></span></span></span></span><ul>
<li>Social Gaming. - Playing TKA, you can be truly social, and enjoy the company of friends face-to-face..  Host a game night, meet new people, kill some orcs.</li>
<li>Unique value of board gaming - A board game offers a different level of enjoyment, control, and satisfaction from online TD gaming, no matter how good the online game.<br/>
</li>
<li>TKA both ends, and doesn't. - ""Huh?"" - Some TD games online never end, they have endless waves; that can be fun... for a while.  But most gamers enjoy a sense of accomplishment and TKA offers that because it be conquered.  Other TD games have too <i>few</i> levels; TKA has endless replay value because you can always create a new game with different combinations of map tiles, new enemies, new Heroes, and new strategies.</li>
<li>Finally, if you're a parent with a child addicted to online TD, this can be a great way to gain some common ground and spend time together.  (We do what we can to support families, as we're a family run business... did you notice the bibs in the supporter perks? ; )<br/>

  My name is John, co-owner of Gate Keeper Games.  We are trying to publish our new game, the highly acclaimed: The King's Armory.  We really love tower defense video games, and so we made a true tower defense board game to share.  After sharing it, The King's Armory has been so highly lauded by everyone who's played it that it seems a must to do everything possible to increase its public availability.  (But don't take our word for it, see the list of reviews below.)
Therefore, this IGG campaign is specifically to help us raise funds to create excellent art for the game in order to help it reach market and draw the attention that people are saying that it deserves.  Since this campaign is not yet for the game itself, we've created a wide array of perks to choose from for your support.100% Funded!The campaign now acts as ""Fixed Funding"", therefore your pledge goes +5% further and...Stretch Goals Announced:

If we hit $4500 - by the end of the campaign, in FOUR DAYS, 
we will increase the value of all ""Game Credits"" by $5 to a total value 
of $30 each!  Go tell your friends!  (Only 1 Early Bird left!)

If we hit $5500 - We will be able to reduce the cost of Minis
 on the KS relaunch by pre-paying for some art and molding costs!  
(Exact amount TBD, but it will be at least a couple bucks per set.)  (I 
should also add: Getting minis involved from the very beginning has 
taken some very good turns this week!)
We will gladly add more Stretch Goals as these are hit.
Here, on IndieGoGo, you can get access to the full Print-n-Play and rules, so that you can play the game now!

By spreading awareness of the game, creating great art, and lowering our production goal, the official Kickstarter launch (October 2013) will be able to meet with tremendous support.
You will make the difference for The King's Armory, in making it become a reality.  Your support means the world to us.  Join the many who have already contributed and are now playing The King's Armory.
Thank you for your support.  If you have any questions, please contact us.  We're completely transparent in our plans, and love feedback and suggestions, so ask us anything you like.Art Sample for the Digital Wallpaper and Poster Reward tiers.

  We're setting out to raise $3,500 for art, graphic design, 
and PR/Outreach/Reviews expenses.  This amount doesn't cover all of our expnses (breakdown below), but every net dollar raised here will improve the game and reduce the funding goal for our upcoming Kickstarter.
By asking for a lower amount than our total need, IGG fees are reduced, which means more of your donation goes toward the actual cause.  (When we reach ""100% funded,"" fees are reduced by 33%.  A set goal of $14,000 is less likely to reach 100% funding than a $3,500 one.)Expense Breakdown:


$6000 Art (40% of funding) *
$1500 Graphic design (10% of funding) *
$2400 Advertising & Reviewer costs (15% of funding) *
$2500 Physical reward creation & shipping (20% of funding)
$350-1400 IGG fees (10-15% of funding)
$14,000 Total

*reduces Kickstarter funding goalRewards!

The Impact of the Game
Community - This game has been a great example of our mission as a fledgling company put into action: bringing people together with board games.  So many people have contributed ideas, art, and blood, sweat and tears to this game.  And it shows!  One of the most common comments, in fact, was gratitude for the way community was prioritized over competition or pride in the first Kickstarter campaign. (first Kickstarter? see Q&A below).
Tower Defense - There are many ""Tower Defense"" board games on the market.  But in the words of Rahdo, a professional non-paid reviewer:
 ""I don't think that there is any other Tower Defense game besides 
The King's Armory, that so closely emulates the game play of a straight 
up flash-based computer tower defense game.  I mean this game really 
does have it all!""  

  So, for the millions of people that enjoy online ""TD"" games, we are the first to bring a true re-creation, and fully playable version, of that to the board game table.  And now you get to take credit for it also.
Game Genre Shift - Why not just play TD online?  Here are our answers.
Social Gaming. - Playing TKA, you can be truly social, and enjoy the company of friends face-to-face..  Host a game night, meet new people, kill some orcs.
Unique value of board gaming - A board game offers a different level of enjoyment, control, and satisfaction from online TD gaming, no matter how good the online game.

TKA both ends, and doesn't. - ""Huh?"" - Some TD games online never end, they have endless waves; that can be fun... for a while.  But most gamers enjoy a sense of accomplishment and TKA offers that because it be conquered.  Other TD games have too few levels; TKA has endless replay value because you can always create a new game with different combinations of map tiles, new enemies, new Heroes, and new strategies.
Finally, if you're a parent with a child addicted to online TD, this can be a great way to gain some common ground and spend time together.  (We do what we can to support families, as we're a family run business... did you notice the bibs in the supporter perks? ; )

Q & A:Q: What happens if you go over $14,000?A: Every buck-a-roo goes towards production costs, and thus we can and will reduce the Funding Goal of the KS game, thus making funding the game (ie: getting it in your hands) easier.  We'll also have a few extra bucks to tip our artists with. (Really looking forward to this.  No joke: 2 of our 3 main artists experienced family tragedies during our 1st campaign, but they both chose to keep working through it.  It's been a rough trip, but they're utterly amazing men, and I say they deserve applause for it.)

Q: What is *Guaranteed Art*?A: This art will absolutely be commissioned based on your pledge.  You WILL see your face on the indicated character/monster type regardless of all else.  Period.  

Q: Game Credit, brilliant!  How does it work?A: An email address is required for all ""Game Credit"" pledge levels.  At the close of IGG we will email each person their own unique 1-use ""Thank You Code"".  When pledging on KS at re-launch these supporters will use the ""Contact me"" link to send me their Thank You Code and what they would like in free stuff - worth up to $25 in Add-Ons or International Shipping.  Once the code is verified, we will act as if your KS pledge amount were increased by $25 with no actual need to increase the pledge amount at all.  It's as simple as that!Note: Max 1 ""Thank You Code"" per KS account, must pledge for at least the base game level (approx $49) to use it.Note: If you wish to give a ""Game Credit"" as a gift, that's fine by us, just give them your Thank You Code.  Simple as that.**Note: This is not to be confused as a monetary return on investment, a cash gift, or any type of profit sharing.  This is simply and straight forward a promise of free stuff for pledges you give to us in advance here.  (As if we had offered the KS Add Ons now.)**

Q: Didn't I already see you on Kickstarter for TKA?A: Yessir!  Our first attempt to Kickstart was a huge success ...except that we failed.  ...but even there, we only 'failed' in

we learned so much, fronted the cost for tons of art (supporting

<h3>Hi, Imscared fans,</h3>
<p>my name is Ivan Zanotti and I'm a game developer. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You maybe know me thanks to ""Imscared - A Pixelated Nightmare"", a game of mine developed 1 year ago.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">To celebrate Imscared birthday, I'd love to do something unique: a more polished and stuff filled version of the game. I tought about how to create a great experience, so the awesome technology called Oculus Rift flew through my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Oculus Rift is a great thing. Horror games will be much, much more immersive and scary with it. And I want Imscared to be much more than a simple ""experience"".<br/>Imscared works breaking the 4th wall, trying to activate the player imagination by simple, rough graphics. I think that the Oculus Rift can enhance the ""4th wall break"" in many ways and I really want to try out those ideas of mine.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So, here I am, ready to develop a NEW Imscared version (also with Oculus Rift support)... But I really need your help to make this dream come true!<br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Right now I'm in a really bad situation, financially talking, and I can't afford the Oculus Rift to develop stuff with it. So I'm talking to all the fans that liked Imscared as much as me!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Fundings, results and perks</h3>

<p><br/>White Face miss You</p></span></span></span></div>","Hi, Imscared fans,
my name is Ivan Zanotti and I'm a game developer. You maybe know me thanks to ""Imscared - A Pixelated Nightmare"", a game of mine developed 1 year ago.
To celebrate Imscared birthday, I'd love to do something unique: a more polished and stuff filled version of the game. I tought about how to create a great experience, so the awesome technology called Oculus Rift flew through my mind.
Oculus Rift is a great thing. Horror games will be much, much more immersive and scary with it. And I want Imscared to be much more than a simple ""experience"".Imscared works breaking the 4th wall, trying to activate the player imagination by simple, rough graphics. I think that the Oculus Rift can enhance the ""4th wall break"" in many ways and I really want to try out those ideas of mine.
So, here I am, ready to develop a NEW Imscared version (also with Oculus Rift support)... But I really need your help to make this dream come true!Right now I'm in a really bad situation, financially talking, and I can't afford the Oculus Rift to develop stuff with it. So I'm talking to all the fans that liked Imscared as much as me!


Fundings, results and perks
The thing is simple: I'm trying to reach the money necessary to get an Oculus Rift and to keep up the good work. The new game will also be playable without the Oculus Rift, in case you can't afford it. Don't worry, I don't want to disappoint anyone! =)

Anyway:IndieGoGo can't create a campaing with a funding goal inferior than $500, so I won't only buy the Oculus Rift with those money: Like said before, I'm going to expand Imscared with new ""levels"" and 4th wall break events, lenghtening the game and making it more unique. Also, to help me and get cool things at the same time, here's two perks for you:

YOUR PORTRAIT IN THE GAME - $20 or moreFans that will donate $20 or more to the cause can send an E-Mail to Imscared@live.com with a personal photo: the game will contain a pixelated portrait of the backer;
DIGITAL GAME MANUAL - $35 or moreFans that will donate $35 or more to the cause will receive via E-Mail a game manual containing hints for the game secrets and curious informations about Imscared. Also, the backer can request the ""Your portrait in the game"" perk if he wants to!
YOUR MAP IN THE GAME - $60 or moreFans that will donate $60 or more to the cause can draw a topdown-like map to see  it as a game area in the new Imscared version.Please contact Imscared@live.com for more infos about this perk!




Other Ways You Can Help The Cause
Probably someone will not help the funding because he can't. I really understand it, so the only thing I'm asking You is to spred the word about this raise funding!

<div>I think Boston FIG would be a great opportunity for me to show my game to a wide audience, generate hype for the eventual release (early 2015), and most importantly, get people playing and receive feedback!</div>

<h3>What is Legends of Beforia?</h3>
<p>If you haven't seen the game yet, it is a simple storytelling game for three players where the core mechanic is telling myths and legends. Players draw ""Myth template cards"" which are then filled in with random creatures, verbs, adjectives, and the like. One player starts off by telling a story based on their randomized prompt, for example, ""Sneaky owl creates the world with a magical slingshot"". Other players then have to draw and replace one word in the myth template, and make up a variation of the myth. The original player chooses their favorite variation to become the new canonical myth, and play continues, with players telling variations on the new version. It's a fun party-style game where in order to win, you have to convince others that you are the best storyteller.</p>
<p>You can read more about the game <a href=""http://thelightaesthetic.com/upcoming-card-game-legends-of-beforia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Creating the art for Legends of Beforia is Illustrator and <a href=""http://dyscourse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dyscourse </a>artist <a href=""https://www.behance.net/carriewitt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Carrie Witt</a>. Together, we are creating a visual aesthetic to the game that is humorous and lighthearted, with some touches of traditional Mexican culture and imagery (with the game originally having been inspired by a scary <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Llorona"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mexican legend</a>, and the importance of the oral tradition in this culture). What we're currently crafting behind the scenes is something akin to a mix between the art styles of Guacamelee and Grim Fandango.</p>

<p>An indie dev table at Boston FIG costs $200. I'm told I can use my submission fee to offset the cost, lowering this amount to just $190! That's not enough, though.</p>
<p>I also need to bring a copy of the game to demo! I have been using <a href=""https://www.thegamecrafter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Game Crafter</a> to print copies of the first prototype. The first prototype cost $10 to produce. The second prototype which we are currently working on (due to be finished by the end of the month) has 33% more cards (80 different cards) and comes in a bigger box, and is estimated to cost $12-15 to produce. If I want to bring two copies to demo, and one backup, that's $45 max.</p>
<p>In addition, I'll need some promo materials, printing a little sign, designing some business cards, fliers, etc. The game doesn't have a logo yet, but I'm going to publish the game under the name <a href=""http://twitter.com/patchworkgames"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patchwork Games</a>, which does have a logo. The website (patchworkgam.es) currently redirects to my blog, but I plan on implementing a proper website in the next couple months. I estimate the cost of these items (minus website) to be ~$30.</p>
<p>That puts the total at $265. The minimum amount you can run an Indiegogo campaign is $500. What will I do with the excess should I be fortunate enough to receive that much? I'll explain below.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What This Means To Me</h3> <p>I am really proud of Legends of Beforia. It is the first of my games without any complex systems or tricky numbers, which is saying something. It is a design that is very simple and organic, and plays upon a person's basic need to tell a story. It's also really fun to watch people laugh and giggle over the stories they end up telling with friends.</p>
<p>I want Legends of Beforia to be the best game it can be, which means I need to show it to lots of people and get good feedback! That is why it's important that I take advantage of every opportunity to have new players try it out.</p>

<p>In addition, I've submitted the game to this year's <a href=""www.indiecade.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IndieCade</a>. I'm still waiting to hear back from them, but regardless of whether I get in, by submitting the game I've obtained a ticket to the festival. So either way I plan on going to LA and showing people Legends of Beforia somehow. To that end, I intend on using whatever surplus money I receive to help towards purchasing a plane ticket to the IndieCade festival in October (~$500).</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I am told that there is no hard deadline for getting a table, but that they are filling up fast, so in the event that I am unable to acquire a table, all funds will be used instead to acquire a plane ticket to IndieCade, to make sure the game is seen there.</p>
<p>I've scheduled the campaign so that there is at least two and a half weeks between the end of the campaign and Boston FIG (I received my notification from them last Friday). In event that I am unable to acquire printed prototypes by that time, I do have copies of the first prototype that I will be willing to demo in its place. However, printing and shipping times have been really good with The Game Crafter (less than a week from order to delivery), and we plan to have all the art for the second prototype by the end of the month.</p>
