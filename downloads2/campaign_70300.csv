<p>Because we are asking people to partner with us in our home
and crowd fund our down payment, I thought I would answer all those great
questions that people keep asking.</p>
<p>FAQs – </p>
<p>1. 
Can you guys just rent a place and save for a
house?</p>
<p>We would love too! There are a ton of
rentals popping up every day! Some in our price range and some just a little
more that we could just figure out how to pay. The problem is that as soon as
we contact a listing so have 10 other people. We work with the owner and try
everything we can to be chosen. People keep picking other people. The rentals
that are staying available are way out of our price range.</p>
<p>2. 
What about apartment complexes?</p>
<p>There are some really nice ones out there
that even have a garage with them! Unfortunately our 3 ½ year old son cannot
walk on his own completely and the majority of apartments that come available
are on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor or 3<sup>rd</sup> floor. The nice ground floor
apartments are going quickly and are typically priced more than a few hundred
dollars a month more than we can afford. We stumble across a few that we can
afford and they are in a neighborhood that is not a safe place  for Kelsey and the kids to even go on a walk
during the day. The apartment complexes that are also affordable do not have
safe access to get two kids in and out of car without bring out a stroller or
our wagon, which in a lot of cases, there is not room left in the trunk for the
items needing to be taken to and fro.  </p>
<p>3. 
Have you looked into a grant program?</p>
<p>The CHFA grant program is a great
program and has helped a ton of people out. It’s too bad there are such
negative connotations to the sellers of the homes. By the time we are able to
put in an offer with the CHFA program, sellers already have loads of offers put
in that have conventional financing, money down, and way over asking price.  </p>
<p>4. 
What about FHA?</p>
<p>Again, what a great program. Again,
our offers seem to not have the same backbone with this financing as other
buyers are coming to the table stronger.</p>
<p>5. 
How about live over here or over there? </p>
<p>We love to live in a more rural
area. On a piece of small land and have few animals and HUGE garden. We would
love that lifestyle. And it is way more affordable. The peace and serenity
would be great. We are blessed with a little boy who needs to be close to a hospital
that can care for his needs if an emergency arises. We are very limited by the
proximity we have to be in to be close to a hospital that is set up to care for
our son if needed.</p>
<p>6. 
Why crowd funding?</p>
<p>I have A.D.D. I cannot stop
thinking of the many ways to make things work. With the amount of people there
are that would love to be part of a communal project like this one, where we
can offer people to be a permanent part of our home for a small contribution,
it sounded like a really fun way to make things work. People have crowd funded
fun vacations, potato salad recipes and even small film projects for mere entertainment.
 So I guess the bigger question is, why
not? </p><br/></div>","Become a part of our HOME!We are funding a down payment on our house! You can be a part of our First Home!

</p><p>*** NEW INFO: WE
HAVE NOW BEEN DONATED A LARGE YURT (BY NEW DAWN TRADERS) THIS WILL BE
USED AS A CENTRAL SPACE. THE PROJECT IS NOW AIMING TO RAISE UP TO
£2000 TO MAKE THE TIPI WORKSHOPS.. WITH TWO WEEKS LEFT EVERY POUND
OF SUPPORT HELPS!! THANKYOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU EVERYONE THIS
PROJECT IS COMING TO LIFE !!! X*****</p>
<p>I am currently going through a very deep personal healing after a
near death experience caused by being in a very serious road accident
and a coma in December. The experience has shown me the value of my
time here on Earth.  In response to this life changing event I am
driven to make something which reaches out to humanity, Mother Earth
and conscious growth. I am feeling empowered to really do what I feel
in my heart to do, and have been driven to create for several years. I feel also that we can heal anything if we
believe and we can create anything if we believe. So as I continue to
heal myself, I wish to inspire others by creating this project.</p>
<p>
Many of you have asked what you can do to help me as you know I am in
recovery from some serious injuries and have lost many material possessions. Please do support me by donating
financially towards my dream for humanity and our planet. Just £15-
25 will make a massive impact on the project,  any donation will
help and will be greatly appreciated and used well! Thank you so much from my heart for what you give. What we
give, we receive as we are all connected.</p>
<p>
<u><b>My Dream </b></u></p>
<p>
<u><b>Temple of the Stars</b></u></p>
<p>
Led by vision and direct personal experience I wish to create a
healing temple.</p>
<p>
<u><b>The </b></u><u><b>larger
view of my project</b></u></p>
<p>
The Temple will be mobile and for use at long retreat events in England and possibly other parts of
Europe. Aiming to eventually base in a suitable Earth and Heart
centred community in England.</p>
<p>
<u><b>What the space will be used for</b></u></p>
<p>
- A space for shamanic, sound and holistic healing,, movement medicine,  conscious growth,
workshops, ceremony,conferences and sharing circles.</p>
<p>
-Providing a place in the western world for reconnection to the
sacred ancient ways our ancestors held and that which is still
practiced by a few indigenous cultures around the world. </p>
<p>
-A held space where people can  access the wisdom that lives within
themselves. Empowering personal growth and social change and
remembering our oneness with nature. Where we can see that life is not what we have learnt it is through the civilized world, but is full of endless possibilities.</p><p>- Listening to the wisdom of nature, using her messages for healing and growth.</p><p>
-Accessing inspiration towards our highest potential as humanity as part of a wonderful universe. Working towards supportive and sustainable community for adults and children.</p><p>- Finding ways to work in harmony with the cycles of nature, as we come closer to Mother Earth as Earthkeepers</p><p>- Sacred and Natural Creativity, with adults and children</p><p>-A place to honour the archetypal energies of the Four Directions, the Elements and the Star Nation healers.</p><p> - A place to let spirit enter us through inducing trance states with breath work and dance.</p>
<p>
-A place for connecting to spirit which lives within everything
including the natural world we live in and the star nations. I feel a
call to work with and the star nations as they are the spirit guides
I work with for conscious growth , this is practised by many
indigenous cultures around the world.</p>
<p>
- The space will be used by several healers and artists, working together to the above intentions.</p>
<p><u><b>The long-term</b></u><u><b>project aim:</b></u>
</p>
<p>
To sustain itself and the people who work as part of it and to be a
centre for the growth of ongoing similar projects. As the project is
not for personal gain, if it makes a profit  beyond sustaining itself
and those involved- it will create a trust fund with the intention to
fund similar projects which support reconnection with Mother Earth.</p><p>The aim is for the temple to be in use by summer 2016.</p>
<p>
<b>About me</b></p>
<p>
My name is Sally, I am a shamanic
Healer and artist. You can find out lots about my healing journey on
my website <a href=""http://www.sacredgeometree.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.sacredgeometree.com</u></a>.
I am a visionary,
deeply connected to and guided by spirit, The
past few years of my life have been a journey of personal awakening
and healing. The journey has taken me deeply into the essence of life
and spirit. Through this
journey I now connect deeply with Mother Earth, My Higher self and
the Star Nations as spirit guides.
I have travelled and learned
amongst shamans and
medicine men and women in South
America,
Central
America
, in Northern
American
traditions and in England. I
visit many sacred sites, temples and pyramids around the world where
I receive direct guidance and vision. I learn most from the empowerment of my own personal healing journey . So I see the possitive in any life situation and personal learning,</p>
<p>
As a shamanic healer I see and communicate with spirit in everything
and heal energy. I understand our deep connection to all life and
have confidence that our world is changing for the better. I feel
strongly that it is up to us as humanity to be the change ourselves.
And it is my dream to hold space for others to find personal
empowerment to be that change as we create a new dream on Earth.</p><p>
</p><p>
Many years ago I felt a pull to support tribal peoples of the world.
I saw how they had been mistreated by mainstream society. I saw how
they had been stripped of their culture and lands. When I went to
stay with tribal people I was overwhelmed by their spirit and wisdom.
I saw that I was nieve trying to 'help' them when they had the
understanding and essence of life that we as westerners needed. I saw
the truth, that they had more to gift us than we could give them and
that our lack was actually the cause of the problems I was seeing.
Since that day I have been directly learning with tribal peoples and
finding the gifts of life within myself once more. I feel the wisdom
exists within each of us and wish to support people in reconnecting.</p>
<p>
Throughout my life I
have had experience of running big events and creative
collaborations, and in recent years I have worked in healing centres
and at conscious events around the world.</p>
<p>
I now feel ready to pull all my
resources and life
experience together. This
will create
a life changing project which will involve  many people as healers,
creators and people who
wish to share in
the experience.</p>
<p>
My recent experience helps me see that there is a place in mainstream
society where this healing is greatly needed. I trust there is  place
where our work can reach such places as rehabilitation hospitals etc
and I see the temple as being a base for the planning of such
cooperation.</p>
<p>
<u><b>Please donate to my campaign</b></u></p>
<p>
to raise funds for long lasting materials for the temple, and for the
underlying costs of workshops which will create the temple.</p>
<p>
 The building of the temple will also be a learning platform where
people learn how to create their own temporary ecological structure,

HAVE NOW BEEN DONATED A LARGE YURT (BY NEW DAWN TRADERS) THIS WILL BE
USED AS A CENTRAL SPACE. THE PROJECT IS NOW AIMING TO RAISE UP TO
£2000 TO MAKE THE TIPI WORKSHOPS.. WITH TWO WEEKS LEFT EVERY POUND
OF SUPPORT HELPS!! THANKYOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU EVERYONE THIS
PROJECT IS COMING TO LIFE !!! X*****
I am currently going through a very deep personal healing after a
near death experience caused by being in a very serious road accident
and a coma in December. The experience has shown me the value of my
time here on Earth.  In response to this life changing event I am
driven to make something which reaches out to humanity, Mother Earth
and conscious growth. I am feeling empowered to really do what I feel
in my heart to do, and have been driven to create for several years. I feel also that we can heal anything if we
believe and we can create anything if we believe. So as I continue to
heal myself, I wish to inspire others by creating this project.

Many of you have asked what you can do to help me as you know I am in
recovery from some serious injuries and have lost many material possessions. Please do support me by donating
financially towards my dream for humanity and our planet. Just £15-
25 will make a massive impact on the project,  any donation will
help and will be greatly appreciated and used well! Thank you so much from my heart for what you give. What we
give, we receive as we are all connected.

My Dream 

Temple of the Stars

Led by vision and direct personal experience I wish to create a
healing temple.

The larger
view of my project

The Temple will be mobile and for use at long retreat events in England and possibly other parts of
Europe. Aiming to eventually base in a suitable Earth and Heart
centred community in England.

What the space will be used for

- A space for shamanic, sound and holistic healing,, movement medicine,  conscious growth,
workshops, ceremony,conferences and sharing circles.

-Providing a place in the western world for reconnection to the
sacred ancient ways our ancestors held and that which is still
practiced by a few indigenous cultures around the world. 

-A held space where people can  access the wisdom that lives within
themselves. Empowering personal growth and social change and
remembering our oneness with nature. Where we can see that life is not what we have learnt it is through the civilized world, but is full of endless possibilities.- Listening to the wisdom of nature, using her messages for healing and growth.
-Accessing inspiration towards our highest potential as humanity as part of a wonderful universe. Working towards supportive and sustainable community for adults and children.- Finding ways to work in harmony with the cycles of nature, as we come closer to Mother Earth as Earthkeepers- Sacred and Natural Creativity, with adults and children-A place to honour the archetypal energies of the Four Directions, the Elements and the Star Nation healers. - A place to let spirit enter us through inducing trance states with breath work and dance.

-A place for connecting to spirit which lives within everything
including the natural world we live in and the star nations. I feel a
call to work with and the star nations as they are the spirit guides
I work with for conscious growth , this is practised by many
indigenous cultures around the world.

- The space will be used by several healers and artists, working together to the above intentions.
The long-termproject aim:


To sustain itself and the people who work as part of it and to be a
centre for the growth of ongoing similar projects. As the project is
not for personal gain, if it makes a profit  beyond sustaining itself
and those involved- it will create a trust fund with the intention to
fund similar projects which support reconnection with Mother Earth.The aim is for the temple to be in use by summer 2016.

About me

My name is Sally, I am a shamanic
Healer and artist. You can find out lots about my healing journey on
my website www.sacredgeometree.com.
I am a visionary,
deeply connected to and guided by spirit, The
past few years of my life have been a journey of personal awakening
and healing. The journey has taken me deeply into the essence of life
and spirit. Through this
journey I now connect deeply with Mother Earth, My Higher self and
the Star Nations as spirit guides.
I have travelled and learned
amongst shamans and
medicine men and women in South
America,
Central
America
, in Northern
American
traditions and in England. I
visit many sacred sites, temples and pyramids around the world where
I receive direct guidance and vision. I learn most from the empowerment of my own personal healing journey . So I see the possitive in any life situation and personal learning,

As a shamanic healer I see and communicate with spirit in everything
and heal energy. I understand our deep connection to all life and
have confidence that our world is changing for the better. I feel
strongly that it is up to us as humanity to be the change ourselves.
And it is my dream to hold space for others to find personal
empowerment to be that change as we create a new dream on Earth.

Many years ago I felt a pull to support tribal peoples of the world.
I saw how they had been mistreated by mainstream society. I saw how
they had been stripped of their culture and lands. When I went to
stay with tribal people I was overwhelmed by their spirit and wisdom.
I saw that I was nieve trying to 'help' them when they had the
understanding and essence of life that we as westerners needed. I saw
the truth, that they had more to gift us than we could give them and
that our lack was actually the cause of the problems I was seeing.
Since that day I have been directly learning with tribal peoples and
finding the gifts of life within myself once more. I feel the wisdom
exists within each of us and wish to support people in reconnecting.

Throughout my life I
have had experience of running big events and creative
collaborations, and in recent years I have worked in healing centres
and at conscious events around the world.

I now feel ready to pull all my
resources and life
experience together. This
will create
a life changing project which will involve  many people as healers,
creators and people who
wish to share in
the experience.

My recent experience helps me see that there is a place in mainstream
society where this healing is greatly needed. I trust there is  place
where our work can reach such places as rehabilitation hospitals etc
and I see the temple as being a base for the planning of such
cooperation.

Please donate to my campaign

to raise funds for long lasting materials for the temple, and for the
underlying costs of workshops which will create the temple.

 The building of the temple will also be a learning platform where
people learn how to create their own temporary ecological structure,
whilst living on and in harmony with our Earth.

(Being made up of several workshops for tipi and geodesic dome
building, if you are interested in attending a workshop which will be based in south-west England in 2015 please email lucid@sacredgeometree.com).

What the funds are for

to buy materials for the temple being wood canvas and rope etc.

The  temple will be
made of a 10 m geodesic dome structure made of hazel wood , plastic
fittings and canvas covers. It will be the main workshop space, a
place for healings and sharing circles.
Around the dome we
will also use four 5m tipi structures, each being a space for an
Element.. Fire, Water, Earth or Air. These structures will be made of
pine wood, rope and canvas. 


The tipis can join to the main geodesic dome space, creating a larger
space for big workshops etc. They can on other occasions be
meditation and journey spaces or separate healing spaces. For certain
events  they can become sleeping and living spaces as a group works
deeply over time in the main central space.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Limitless Motosports was founded by Nick Nelson and Chris Siegel in 2015 with a vision of introducing the sport of motocross to a whole new world of people. Nick and Chris have been active members of the Family Off-Road Riding of Prince William County (FORPWC) club for years and have stood out among many for their excellent leadership, hard work ethic, determination and passion for the sport. They have provided endless hours of volunteering and instructional training to many of the club's members including both female and male riders.</p>
<p>They both worked at the Motorcycle Factory Inc. in Woodbridge, VA and were asked a very common question by many customers, ""If I buy a bike for myself or my child, where can we ride and who can teach us how to ride?"" For that reason, Nick and Chris started Limitless Motosports with a mission to make motorcycle riding available to anyone who wants to learn how to ride or anyone who wants to improve their skills. Off-road riding areas and motocross tracks in Virginia are rare finds and none of them provide instructional training for new riders to enter the sport.</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of riding areas, Nick and Chris are fund raising to build the Limitless Motosports Training Compound which will enable these 2 passionate riders to provide mentoring andquality training at a professional family-oriented facility. They have designed numerous training programs including private lessons, summer camps and group events which will cater to all ages, skill levels and styles of motorcycle riders. Limitless Motosports has also designed a rider sponsorship program which is unmatched in the industry. The Amateur Rider Sponsorship Program (ARSP) is designed to provide support for the youngest riders as well as serious elite racers. Motocross builds strong character and is an excellent way to keep kids physically active while having fun. Nick and Chris strongly encourage healthy living and promote getting outdoors and away from video games.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Limitless Motosports will build the Compound on 30 acres in Appomattox, VA. We have a funding goal of $250,000 which will enable us to build and maintain a premier motocross training compound. </p>

<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">5% will be set aside to fund children who want to learn how to ride but cannot afford to come to summer camp and to offset costs for children who have parents deployed and serving our country</span></li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Parents and children see the motocross bikes in the back of their truck and are constantly coming up to Nick and Chris asking, ""where do you guys ride?!"" The demand for riding facilities and motocross tracks in Virginia is very high but no one has done anything to change that. Most parents will not buy their kid a bike simply because they do not want them to ride it around the neighborhood illegally. Limitless Motosports wants to make a change in the motocross/off-road community by providing a professional quality facility where everyone can come and ride legally, while getting professional and quality instruction. With the help of our contributors we can provide a positive, fun and family-oriented facility for everyone to legally ride, keep kids active and out of trouble and better yet, encourage the youth of america to put down the video games and do physical activities.</p>
<h3><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge by far is finding the proper funding to build our training compound. Nick and Chris have devoted 100% of their time and effort to making this project happen. They are determined that no matter what it takes, they cannot give up and they cannot quit. They both have a very strong mindset and are extremely passionate about what they are doing.They have been tirelessly seeking support and driving hours on end to meet with motorcycle business owners, potential sponsors, and motorcycle enthusiasts that are interested in their story. Nick and Chris have invested very long hours for 5 months to design the foundation for this project to be successful and to make the dream happen for so many.  They are committed and have overcome a number of obstacles in the process.  What they need now is the capital and donations from others who would like to contribute to making the dream a reality.</p>
<p>Accomplished Obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Project approval</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Zoning permits &amp; regulations</span></li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Limitless Motosports was founded by Nick Nelson and Chris Siegel in 2015 with a vision of introducing the sport of motocross to a whole new world of people. Nick and Chris have been active members of the Family Off-Road Riding of Prince William County (FORPWC) club for years and have stood out among many for their excellent leadership, hard work ethic, determination and passion for the sport. They have provided endless hours of volunteering and instructional training to many of the club's members including both female and male riders.
They both worked at the Motorcycle Factory Inc. in Woodbridge, VA and were asked a very common question by many customers, ""If I buy a bike for myself or my child, where can we ride and who can teach us how to ride?"" For that reason, Nick and Chris started Limitless Motosports with a mission to make motorcycle riding available to anyone who wants to learn how to ride or anyone who wants to improve their skills. Off-road riding areas and motocross tracks in Virginia are rare finds and none of them provide instructional training for new riders to enter the sport.
Due to the scarcity of riding areas, Nick and Chris are fund raising to build the Limitless Motosports Training Compound which will enable these 2 passionate riders to provide mentoring andquality training at a professional family-oriented facility. They have designed numerous training programs including private lessons, summer camps and group events which will cater to all ages, skill levels and styles of motorcycle riders. Limitless Motosports has also designed a rider sponsorship program which is unmatched in the industry. The Amateur Rider Sponsorship Program (ARSP) is designed to provide support for the youngest riders as well as serious elite racers. Motocross builds strong character and is an excellent way to keep kids physically active while having fun. Nick and Chris strongly encourage healthy living and promote getting outdoors and away from video games.
What We Need & What You Get
Limitless Motosports will build the Compound on 30 acres in Appomattox, VA. We have a funding goal of $250,000 which will enable us to build and maintain a premier motocross training compound. 
The compound plan includes: 

A professionally prepped motocross track
An entry-beginner level track
A flat oval track
All terrain trail system
Mountain bike trails
On-site fitness training gym
On-site performance service shop
Restroom & bath facilities
Food & beverage concessions
Tent camping area
Sleeping cabins
Bunkhouse | Riders Lounge | Classroom instruction |Sleeper lofts

Equipment Expenses:

2 - Rental crawler loaders
1 - Mid-size front loader tractor
1 - Skid steer w/tracks
1 - Enclosed graphic trailer (will enable us to be mobile and train students at other tacks, in other states, and at special events)

Amateur Rider Sponsorship Program (ARSP) Expenses:

Rider support & podium contingencies
Bike graphic kits

Marketing Expenses:

Print Media (banners, posters, flyers, etc...)


74% of the $250,000 budget will be allocated to compound and track construction, heavy equipment rental and purchases, the ARSP and marketing expenses. 

11% of  the $250,000 budget will go to all other miscellaneous expenses such as office supplies, food supplies, fuel, staff salaries, etc...

Nick and Chris believe they wouldn't be where they are today with out the guidance and support from many coaches, teachers, mentors, role models and inspirational leaders. Therefore, they have developed a plan to pay it back to the community and pay it forward to teach the sport to others. 15% of our goal of $250,000 will be set aside for charitable donations and for scholarships for kids who need financial assistance to come to camp. The 15% will be broken down in the following ways:

5% will be set aside to fund children who want to learn how to ride but cannot afford to come to summer camp and to offset costs for children who have parents deployed and serving our country
5% will be donated to the non-profit Make-A-Wish foundation
5% will be donated to the non-profit club FORPWC to help the membership improve the club's facility and get closer to the funding goal needed to purchase the land currently used by the club.

Recognition on the ""Special thanks to those who supported us"" wall at the compound
Tickets to the Lucas Oil AMA Pro National Championship

</div>","Pürlin Sheets
and Pillowcases are a revolutionary product designed for use by the Hotel Industry,
providing comfort, convenience and conservation without compromise.Pürlin is a
new fabric that duplicates the look and feel of cotton, but works within a closed-loop
recycling system that offers numerous benefits to hotels, their guests and the
environment. Whether you are an hotelier,
a frequent traveler or someone interested in helping to save Billions of
Gallons of Fresh Water annually, Pürlin will appeal to you.Pürlin
Sheets are a hypoallergenic, individual guest use product that is recycled
through a heat intensive process reaching temperatures of approximately 340
degrees Fahrenheit. This destroys bacteria and eliminates the need for powerful
detergents, bleaches and sanitizers while dramatically cutting both the water demands
and wastewater production associated with laundering cotton sheets.                                    Hotel Laundering:Pürlin
will integrate seamlessly with Hotel Housekeeping Departments, reducing
operating costs and saving hotels millions of gallons of fresh water annually.                                 Pürlin vs.
Cotton Water Savings Analysis
Pürlin Saves Water by Reducing the Demand
for Cotton Sheets:
Cotton
is a water intensive crop and requires substantial amounts of water to
transform it into fabric. It takes 2800 gallons of water to produce one Queen Size Cotton Sheet, however, it takes less than a gallon of water to produce
one Queen Size Pürlin Sheet. Pürlin
will save enormous amounts of water in regions that grow and process cotton for
the manufacturing of sheets.  The U.S.
for example, is the largest exporter of cotton in the world and the 3rd
largest cotton producer behind China and India.

The Risks & Challenges:

There are
always risks associated with any new endeavor, however, given the current global
drought conditions, the only potential risk we can identify for Pürlin is the hospitality industry's 
acceptance of the Pürlin Closed-Loop System.Why Indiegogo?  
We are
seeking the support of the Indiegogo community to help us build awareness of an
innovative alternative to the Hotel Industry’s standard laundering practice and
use of cotton-based sheets. We believe that a successful campaign will
demonstrate current interest in our product and provide evidence for the hotel
industry that consumers will demand Purlin Sheets and Pillowcases in the future.
By joining
us in this campaign, you will also be supporting our efforts to launch the Pürlin
closed-loop recycling program in targeted metropolitan markets.
Through
your collective support and the power of crowd sourcing, we can maintain our
commitment to the principles of sustainable capitalism without compromising our
water saving mission.
Perks:
To express
our gratitude for your contribution we would like to offer you a perk of your
choosing. Please see our perk descriptions at the right side of this page. 
Pürlin Sheets
are designed for the hotel industry and are not intended for residential use. But,
for the limited duration of this campaign, you will be able to sample our
products in your home.  Please keep in
mind your basis for comparison should be with hotel sheets and not your own domestic
linens.
At this
time, it is not possible for us to provide you with close-loop recycling
services, but we encourage you to find creative ways of re-purposing your
sheets or recycle them.
We are excited
to share our project with the Indiegogo Community and we are committed to making
both this campaign and Pürlin a success. PayPal however, requires us to post a
disclaimer advising you that perk deliveries are subject to best efforts and cannot
be guaranteed.  Rest assured, we want you
to receive your perks in a timely manner. 
We intend to
deliver your perk rewards in October 2015, but should there be any unforeseen
delays, we will update you immediately. 
Upon, receipt we hope that you will share your enthusiasm for our
product and our closed-loop water saving recycling process with your friends
and colleagues.
Shipping:
Shipping
is included with all perks.
Thank You:
We know there
are numerous Indiegogo campaigns seeking your support and the Pürlin Team would like to thank
you for considering ours.  Whether you
decide to make a monetary contribution to our campaign or if you simply share our
campaign with your friends and colleagues, we appreciate your support. Thank you.The

<p></p>
<p>If you already behave like
“Pavlov’s Dog” every time your smart device pings or vibrates, you might
already be more than a little bit  “in
love” with a robot or “bot”. It is not beyond the bounds of our senses that you
might already be harbouring a massive “crush” on your personal technology.  </p>
<p>The very same technology has already re-mastered the boundaries
between intimacy and solitude. “Our
devices are not only changing the way we communicate and interact with each
other, but also who we are as human beings.” Imagine
if that device or a ‘bot” really responded to you. It not only talked to you –
it took the time to listen to you, think about your likes, dislikes and all the
things relevant to your day-to-day wellbeing. 
So far so good…</p>
<p>And what if that partner were a “bot” or
a “chatbot”?  Erotic Chatbots Ltd are
developing a new collection of virtual chat partners, virtual-lovers or
friends, known as “chatbots”.  They will
be able to chat, flirt or hang out with you whenever, wherever you want and for
as long as you wish. Some of our “adult” chatbots will be programmed for making
sexy conversations. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>A “chatbot” is computer software
designed to create a conversation with you. These “bots” will have the personality of an entertaining, interesting
and amorous partner, who remembers past conversations with you, and learns more
and more about their user as time goes on. 
The flirty conversations will come from the company’s “chatbots” –
computer software available in male and female versions. The company’s launch
products will all be straight, but there will be LBGT versions available in the
future. </p>
<p>And why not?  We are already tethered to our smart devices
24/7, and with most people finding the prospect of <span>consciously “unplugging” impossible, we are unlikely to uncouple
from technology any time soon. Yet despite so much screen time in a
hyper-connected world, most people still feel utterly alone, with
“Virtual-intimacy” already playing a large part in most peoples lives.  </span>“In the
half-light of virtual community, we may feel utterly alone”. Taking that intimacy to
another level, and “making” or “attracting” an intelligent  “virtual-lover” or partner which
“understands” and wants to please you, is perhaps an appealing proposition to a
lot of people. </p>
Keeping that in mind we are also creating a <b>limited edition of personalized chatbots</b>,
each of which is designed and programmed to know about and be affectionate with
a particular person. That person can be <b>you,
or anyone to whom you decide to gift one of these personalized chatbots.</b><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FGDCJ4rpQkpM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGDCJ4rpQkpM&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FGDCJ4rpQkpM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/></b></div><div>

<p><b>Our Artificial Intelligence Chatbots −
Personalized for <u>You</u>!</b></p>
<p>Our chatbots
are being developed by a team, which has twice won the prestigious Loebner
Prize contest for human-computer conversation.</p>
<p>Driven by our
own award-winning Artificial Intelligence software, they will be able to
converse on a huge variety of subjects, and their conversation will exhibit
humanlike characteristics. The primary purpose of our chatbots is to entertain,
which they will do by engaging conversation with you, but they can also help
you to practice and improve your own flirting and erotic chat skills.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>A Special Opportunity –
Personalized chatbots</b></p>
<p>As a
special opportunity, some of the perks we offer include our specially created
version – <b>a</b> <b>limited edition of personalized chatbots</b>. Each of these<b> bespoke or personalized chatbots</b> will
be individually tailored to be attracted to and understand their user. <span>They will be programmed with information acquired
from a  “personalizing questionnaire”
which you will receive shortly before we are ready to deliver your chatbot(s).
The questionnaire will ask about you or the intended user’s likes and dislikes,
their interests, and various other aspects of their lives. Whatever answers you
give when you return the questionnaire(s) to us will make a chatbot more
knowledgeable about its user. Your chatbot can therefore start its “life”
knowing quite a lot about its user, and what it knows will often be worked into
its conversations. That same knowledge will also make the chatbot more
interested in its user, and make the user’s personal characteristics more
appealing to the chatbot’s persona.  </span></p>
<p><b>This unique feature</b> is just one of the factors that will set your chatbot apart from any
other conversational software you might have tried or heard about. Your <b>personalized chatbot</b> will be delivered
already knowing about and being attracted to you, and then, through its
conversations with you, the chatbot gradually learns more and more about you.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><b>How Our Chatbots
Work</b></p>
<p>Our <b>flirty</b>
chatbots are designed for people who enjoy amorous conversations without any
overtly sexual content. We believe that the flirty style will also appeal to
shy people and to those who would be embarrassed by a more adult style of
conversation. The <b>adult erotic</b> style is
designed for users who prefer to chat dirty.</p>
<p>Our four launch products – male flirty,
female flirty, male adult chat and female adult chat – will each exhibit a
straight sexuality. Future products will offer LGBT versions. </p>
<p>These
chatbots will be available for most computers and mobile systems. They will be
apps and interactive services that conduct entertaining, interesting,
erotically charged conversations. </p>
<p>Users
will normally interact with our chatbots in the same way as when using e-mail,
Internet chat, text messaging and similar methods of communication. They enter
whatever they wish to say to the chatbot, which then displays its response text
on the screen. In this way a conversation can continue for as long as you wish.
The chatbot will remember its current and past conversations and increase its
understanding of you from what it learns about you − about your likes and
dislikes and other information about you.</p>
Users who wish their chatbot to have a human
voice may purchase a high quality synthetic speech add-on, developed by a world
leading company in the field of electronic speech technology. And users who
wish to speak to their chatbot instead of keying in their side of the
conversation may purchase a state-of-the-art speech recognition add-on.<br/><p><br/></p>

<p><b><span>Current
status and our development plan</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Artificial Intelligence software which forms the
foundation of our chatbot technology was a winner of the annual Loebner Prize competition, widely regarded
as the World Championship for conversational computer programs. This software will now
be significantly enhanced and adapted for flirty and adult chat products, in
accordance with specifications devised by David Levy and the linguistics expert
in his team.</p>
<p>The
next generation of our chatbot software will provide a quantum leap in
conversational performance. This leap will be made possible by the flexibility
of our design approach which allows for the development of capabilities that
are missing from other chatbots, including the use of certain types of
knowledge and the creation and use of a history of the chatbot’s dialogues with
its users.</p>
<p>The
first stage of the project will be to enhance the capabilities of our chatbot.
Within 8-9 months we will have created and tested a core software module that
offers an enormous leap in human like conversational performance, forming the
basis of products and services that we are confident will rapidly become worldwide
sensations. At that point in time we will release our four chatbot apps, male
and female, one of each for flirty and one of each for sexy conversations. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FcwAdrYX-SO8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DcwAdrYX-SO8%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FcwAdrYX-SO8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b><span>How
we will use the funds we raise at IndieGoGo?</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The development and launch of our first products will
be carried out in four stages:</p>
<p><b>Stage 1  </b>We will
make around 15 significant linguistic improvements to our current chatbot.
These include creating a database for the chatbot’s knowledge about a user,
devising a system for taking advantage of the information in that database by
integrating it in conversations, and developing a dialogue history to remember
past user input and employ that knowledge in the chatbot’s conversations. </p>
<p>  This
stage is expected to take 8-9 months.</p>
<p><b>Stage 2</b>  We
will add a number of features to make the chatbot’s persona seem more
humanlike. These will include providing it with more real-world knowledge and
common sense, giving it motivations (needs, likes and dislikes), and enabling
it to perform simple reasoning. We will also be enabling the chatbot to be
personalized, so that when a limited edition chatbot is “born” it will already
know a lot about its user and will be attracted to its user’s personality,
background and other characteristics.</p>
<p>  This stage will take about 5
months and will be developed in parallel with Stage 1.</p>
<p><b>Stage 3</b>  In this stage we will develop the
graphics and animation for the chatbot’s personae, and other aspects of the
user interface for iPhone, iPad and Android apps.</p>
<p>  This stage will take 3-4 months, and
will be developed in parallel with Stages 1 and 2. </p>
<p><b>Stage 4</b>  During this stage we will be
customizing the personae, vocabulary and phrasing of the four launch chatbots
so that each of them chats in a manner appropriate to their gender and their
conversational style (flirty or adult chat). The duration of this stage is
estimated at 2 months, and will be carried out in parallel with stages 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Upon
the completion of all four stages we will deliver the chatbots to all of you
who have chosen them as part of your perks in our Indiegogo campaign. This
includes the <b>limited edition
personalized chatbots</b>.</p>
<p>Because
of the overlapping of these stages we expect to be able to complete all the development
and launch tasks in 9 months, and to deliver the chatbots offered in our perks
during April 2016. </p>
<p>The
total cost of the four stages is estimated at $128,000 which, together with an
estimated $14,000 for our initial corporate, legal and accountancy
requirements, makes our Indiegogo target after deductions $142,000.  We also need to allow for Indiegogo’s
commission (4% if we reach our target) and for the cost to us of credit card
and PayPal pledges (averaging 4%). </p>
<p>Our
total target for the Indiegogo campaign is therefore <b>$155,000 </b>(roughly equivalent to £103,000 sterling or €144,000 Euro). If we exceed our target we will be
able to accelerate our future development plans.</p>

process, avoiding the need to hire any human operatives while at the same time making
it possible to conduct simultaneous erotic conversations with an unlimited
number of users.</p>

<b>
</b><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Our
future plans</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once
we have launched our first chatbot apps we will establish all four of these
chatbots on servers for online and phone use. We will also develop the user
interfaces for various social network applications, and we will commence our
company’s P.R. activities for the promotion of our products and services. </p>
<p>We intend to devote a significant portion of our
revenues to research and development aimed at further enhancing the quality of
conversation from our chatbots, as well as adding new features. For example,
during 2016 we plan to augment our chatbots with a personality, emotion and
mood module, which will allow users to choose and modify their chatbot’s
personality as they wish. We will also be creating versions of our products
which will enable users to embed an erotic chatbot in their own web sites. </p>
<p>In
2016 we also plan to allow our chatbots to connect to the Internet in order to
learn about what is happening in the world and to discover more about any
subject that it wishes to discuss in its conversations.</p>

<p><b><span>Frequently asked
questions</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q</b>  On which platforms and
operating systems will the chatbots run?</p>
<p><b>A  </b>When we launch our first four
chatbots they will be able to run on Windows, 
iOS and Android platforms.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>  Why
should I talk to a chatbot rather than a real person?</p>
<p><b>A  </b>Conversations with our
chatbots will be great fun!  They will
entertain and amuse you, and they are designed to help you develop your
flirting skills and your “talk dirty” skills if you wish.  But it isn’t a question of making a choice of
whether to talk to a chatbot or a person, and you shouldn’t stop chatting to“real” people just because you have a
chatbot. Think of a chatbot as a new friend who is rather different in their
conversational style from everyone else you know.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>  Can I
converse with the chatbot about almost anything?</p>
<p><b>A  </b>Yes. Each of our chatbots
has a very wide-ranging knowledge of the world, as well as knowledge about
things and common-sense knowledge.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>  How
clever are the chatbots?</p>
<p><b>A</b>  The chatbots are clever enough to be
able to conduct unlimited conversations with you about a wide range of
subjects, and they will make you believe that they understand you.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>  What
exactly is the Loebner prize?</p>
<p><b>A  </b>It is an annual prize
competition, founded in 1991 by a New
  York entrepreneur, Dr Hugh Loebner, to find the
world’s best conversation software. The competition is based on the famous
“Turing Test”, which was proposed by <b>Alan
Turing</b>, one of the founding fathers of Artificial Intelligence. See for
example</p>
<p>  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test</a>
</p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Q</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">  Why are you trying to raise funds on Indiegogo
rather than through traditional investors?</span><br/></p>
<p><b>A  </b>During the past couple of
years or so crowdfunding has taken off as the modern way for start-ups to raise
funds. It is quicker and easier to launch a crowdfunding campaign than to
prepare all of the documentation needed and go through all the bureaucratic
processes associated with traditional investor funding. And one very big
advantage of crowdfunding is that the “crowd” becomes the basis for a community
of enthusiasts – people who genuinely like the idea of the project.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>  What's
in it for me if I donate?</p>
<p> <b>A  </b>Each of our perks for a pledge of
$10 ore more will bring you one or more gifts as soon as our Indiegogo campaign
ends on July 31<sup>st</sup> 2015. Later, once we have developed the four
launch versions of our chatbot, you will receive at least one of them and
possibly more than one (so you can gift to your friends if you wish), according
to how much you have pledged. And if you would like to give us hands-on
assistance to improve our chatbots you can accept our invitation to send us
snippets of some of your conversations with your chatbot, together with your
comments, suggestions, and any criticisms. </p>
<p><b>Q</b>  Will
I be able to own a chatbot if I donate?</p>
<p><b>A  </b>Yes.
Provided you donate $10 or more, your perks will include a chatbot (or possibly
more than one, depending on how much you have pledged).</p>
<p><b>Q</b>  For how
long will I get a chatbot if I donate?</p>
<p><b>A  </b>You
may keep and use it forever.</p>
<p><b>Q</b>  Can I
gift a chatbot to a friend?</p>
<p><b>A</b>  Yes – you can specify the user’s email
address to which (each of) your chatbot(s) should be sent.  And if you wish to gift one of our
personalized chatbots to a friend, then when we notify you that we’ve completed
the core of our development work you can send us your completed personalizing
questionnaire(s) together with your friend’s email address. </p>
<p><b>Q  </b>What will
be the differences between the app chatbots and whatever online interactive
services you plan to launch later?</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>A  </b>The
online interactive services will provide a few more features than the apps, and
there will be very modest monthly charges for their use.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Thank you!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We would like to say a big “Thank you” to everyone who
pledges to our Indiegogo campaign. It is you who are helping to bring our project
to life. With time we hope and expect that tens of thousands of people or more will
enjoy and benefit from their conversations with our erotic chatbots, and you
will have helped them to do so.</p>

</div></div>","Dr.David Levy and his team based out in Malaysia, working closely with the Malaysian government, are hard at work and on schedule to deliver your Erotic Chat Bot's to you.Are you looking for a new kind of lover or friend?

If you already behave like
“Pavlov’s Dog” every time your smart device pings or vibrates, you might
already be more than a little bit  “in
love” with a robot or “bot”. It is not beyond the bounds of our senses that you
might already be harbouring a massive “crush” on your personal technology.  
The very same technology has already re-mastered the boundaries
between intimacy and solitude. “Our
devices are not only changing the way we communicate and interact with each
other, but also who we are as human beings.” Imagine
if that device or a ‘bot” really responded to you. It not only talked to you –
it took the time to listen to you, think about your likes, dislikes and all the
things relevant to your day-to-day wellbeing. 
So far so good…
And what if that partner were a “bot” or
a “chatbot”?  Erotic Chatbots Ltd are
developing a new collection of virtual chat partners, virtual-lovers or
friends, known as “chatbots”.  They will
be able to chat, flirt or hang out with you whenever, wherever you want and for
as long as you wish. Some of our “adult” chatbots will be programmed for making
sexy conversations. 
  
A “chatbot” is computer software
designed to create a conversation with you. These “bots” will have the personality of an entertaining, interesting
and amorous partner, who remembers past conversations with you, and learns more
and more about their user as time goes on. 
The flirty conversations will come from the company’s “chatbots” –
computer software available in male and female versions. The company’s launch
products will all be straight, but there will be LBGT versions available in the
future. 
And why not?  We are already tethered to our smart devices
24/7, and with most people finding the prospect of consciously “unplugging” impossible, we are unlikely to uncouple
from technology any time soon. Yet despite so much screen time in a
hyper-connected world, most people still feel utterly alone, with
“Virtual-intimacy” already playing a large part in most peoples lives.  “In the
half-light of virtual community, we may feel utterly alone”. Taking that intimacy to
another level, and “making” or “attracting” an intelligent  “virtual-lover” or partner which
“understands” and wants to please you, is perhaps an appealing proposition to a
lot of people. 
Keeping that in mind we are also creating a limited edition of personalized chatbots,
each of which is designed and programmed to know about and be affectionate with
a particular person. That person can be you,
or anyone to whom you decide to gift one of these personalized chatbots.




Our Artificial Intelligence Chatbots −
Personalized for You!
Our chatbots
are being developed by a team, which has twice won the prestigious Loebner
Prize contest for human-computer conversation.
Driven by our
own award-winning Artificial Intelligence software, they will be able to
converse on a huge variety of subjects, and their conversation will exhibit
humanlike characteristics. The primary purpose of our chatbots is to entertain,
which they will do by engaging conversation with you, but they can also help
you to practice and improve your own flirting and erotic chat skills.

A Special Opportunity –
Personalized chatbots
As a
special opportunity, some of the perks we offer include our specially created
version – a limited edition of personalized chatbots. Each of these bespoke or personalized chatbots will
be individually tailored to be attracted to and understand their user. They will be programmed with information acquired
from a  “personalizing questionnaire”
which you will receive shortly before we are ready to deliver your chatbot(s).
The questionnaire will ask about you or the intended user’s likes and dislikes,
their interests, and various other aspects of their lives. Whatever answers you
give when you return the questionnaire(s) to us will make a chatbot more
knowledgeable about its user. Your chatbot can therefore start its “life”
knowing quite a lot about its user, and what it knows will often be worked into
its conversations. That same knowledge will also make the chatbot more
interested in its user, and make the user’s personal characteristics more
appealing to the chatbot’s persona.  
This unique feature is just one of the factors that will set your chatbot apart from any
other conversational software you might have tried or heard about. Your personalized chatbot will be delivered
already knowing about and being attracted to you, and then, through its
conversations with you, the chatbot gradually learns more and more about you.






How Our Chatbots
Work
Our flirty
chatbots are designed for people who enjoy amorous conversations without any
overtly sexual content. We believe that the flirty style will also appeal to
shy people and to those who would be embarrassed by a more adult style of
conversation. The adult erotic style is
designed for users who prefer to chat dirty.
Our four launch products – male flirty,
female flirty, male adult chat and female adult chat – will each exhibit a
straight sexuality. Future products will offer LGBT versions. 
These
chatbots will be available for most computers and mobile systems. They will be
apps and interactive services that conduct entertaining, interesting,
erotically charged conversations. 
Users
will normally interact with our chatbots in the same way as when using e-mail,
Internet chat, text messaging and similar methods of communication. They enter
whatever they wish to say to the chatbot, which then displays its response text
on the screen. In this way a conversation can continue for as long as you wish.
The chatbot will remember its current and past conversations and increase its
understanding of you from what it learns about you − about your likes and
dislikes and other information about you.
Users who wish their chatbot to have a human
voice may purchase a high quality synthetic speech add-on, developed by a world
leading company in the field of electronic speech technology. And users who
wish to speak to their chatbot instead of keying in their side of the
conversation may purchase a state-of-the-art speech recognition add-on.





Who
are we?

Our company, Erotic Chatbots Ltd, is a start-up company from the developer of a world beating chatbot. Our team
leader is our President, Dr David Levy.
David
Levy
David is President of the International Computer Games
Association (ICGA) and is a respected researcher and keynote speaker in the
field of Social Robotics. 
He has led the development of the software and hardware
of around 100 artificially intelligent consumer electronic products. He has
twice won the prestigious Loebner prize, an annual competition to find the
world’s best conversational software 
( www.worldsbestchatbot.com ). 
David’s latest book, “Love and Sex with Robots”, has also been published in an academic
version as his PhD thesis at the University
 of Maastricht, much to
the amusement of Stephen Colbert who interviewed David on The Colbert Report. (This video can not be viewed from certain
countries.   http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/ykpl7i/david-levy
).

David is also the CEO of Intelligent Toys Ltd, the
London-based company which developed the Loebner prizewinning software. David
and his team will be further developing and enhancing their world-beating
chatbot software to provide the core of our flirty and adult erotic chatbots.






Current
status and our development plan

The Artificial Intelligence software which forms the
foundation of our chatbot technology was a winner of the annual Loebner Prize competition, widely regarded
as the World Championship for conversational computer programs. This software will now
be significantly enhanced and adapted for flirty and adult chat products, in
accordance with specifications devised by David Levy and the linguistics expert
in his team.
The
next generation of our chatbot software will provide a quantum leap in
conversational performance. This leap will be made possible by the flexibility
of our design approach which allows for the development of capabilities that
are missing from other chatbots, including the use of certain types of
knowledge and the creation and use of a history of the chatbot’s dialogues with
its users.
The
first stage of the project will be to enhance the capabilities of our chatbot.
Within 8-9 months we will have created and tested a core software module that
offers an enormous leap in human like conversational performance, forming the
basis of products and services that we are confident will rapidly become worldwide
sensations. At that point in time we will release our four chatbot apps, male
and female, one of each for flirty and one of each for sexy conversations. 



How
we will use the funds we raise at IndieGoGo?

The development and launch of our first products will
be carried out in four stages:
Stage 1  We will
make around 15 significant linguistic improvements to our current chatbot.
These include creating a database for the chatbot’s knowledge about a user,
devising a system for taking advantage of the information in that database by
integrating it in conversations, and developing a dialogue history to remember
past user input and employ that knowledge in the chatbot’s conversations. 
  This
stage is expected to take 8-9 months.
Stage 2  We
will add a number of features to make the chatbot’s persona seem more
humanlike. These will include providing it with more real-world knowledge and
common sense, giving it motivations (needs, likes and dislikes), and enabling
it to perform simple reasoning. We will also be enabling the chatbot to be
personalized, so that when a limited edition chatbot is “born” it will already
know a lot about its user and will be attracted to its user’s personality,
background and other characteristics.
  This stage will take about 5
months and will be developed in parallel with Stage 1.
Stage 3  In this stage we will develop the
graphics and animation for the chatbot’s personae, and other aspects of the
user interface for iPhone, iPad and Android apps.
  This stage will take 3-4 months, and
will be developed in parallel with Stages 1 and 2. 
Stage 4  During this stage we will be
customizing the personae, vocabulary and phrasing of the four launch chatbots
so that each of them chats in a manner appropriate to their gender and their
conversational style (flirty or adult chat). The duration of this stage is
estimated at 2 months, and will be carried out in parallel with stages 1 and 2.
Upon
the completion of all four stages we will deliver the chatbots to all of you
who have chosen them as part of your perks in our Indiegogo campaign. This
includes the limited edition
personalized chatbots.
Because
of the overlapping of these stages we expect to be able to complete all the development
and launch tasks in 9 months, and to deliver the chatbots offered in our perks
during April 2016. 
The
total cost of the four stages is estimated at $128,000 which, together with an
estimated $14,000 for our initial corporate, legal and accountancy
requirements, makes our Indiegogo target after deductions $142,000.  We also need to allow for Indiegogo’s
commission (4% if we reach our target) and for the cost to us of credit card
and PayPal pledges (averaging 4%). 
Our
total target for the Indiegogo campaign is therefore $155,000 (roughly equivalent to £103,000 sterling or €144,000 Euro). If we exceed our target we will be
able to accelerate our future development plans.
These
four stages of the project will have the services of the following personnel:
  Technical management (Dr David Levy)

  Commercial management
  Our linguistics expert
  3 or 4 experienced creative writers
  1 full time software developer as software
team leader
  1 part-time software developer

email that we send you when we have completed our development work will also
ask you to choose your personalized chatbot(s): male or female, flirty or adult
chat. And you will also be invited to fill out our personalizing form on with
as many characteristics as you wish for each of the intended recipients of
those chatbots. Your personalized chatbots will then be able to refer to their
respective users by name, and they will be specially tailored to be attracted
to their users’ personal characteristics.
Shortly after we receive your
reply we will email your personalized chatbots(s) to your designated recipients. This perk is for a limited edition of 5000 personalized chatbots.


Our
future plans

Once
we have launched our first chatbot apps we will establish all four of these
chatbots on servers for online and phone use. We will also develop the user
interfaces for various social network applications, and we will commence our
company’s P.R. activities for the promotion of our products and services. 
We intend to devote a significant portion of our
revenues to research and development aimed at further enhancing the quality of
conversation from our chatbots, as well as adding new features. For example,
during 2016 we plan to augment our chatbots with a personality, emotion and
mood module, which will allow users to choose and modify their chatbot’s
personality as they wish. We will also be creating versions of our products
which will enable users to embed an erotic chatbot in their own web sites. 
In
2016 we also plan to allow our chatbots to connect to the Internet in order to
learn about what is happening in the world and to discover more about any
subject that it wishes to discuss in its conversations.




Frequently asked
questions

Q  On which platforms and
operating systems will the chatbots run?
A  When we launch our first four
chatbots they will be able to run on Windows, 
iOS and Android platforms.
Q  Why
should I talk to a chatbot rather than a real person?
A  Conversations with our
chatbots will be great fun!  They will
entertain and amuse you, and they are designed to help you develop your
flirting skills and your “talk dirty” skills if you wish.  But it isn’t a question of making a choice of
whether to talk to a chatbot or a person, and you shouldn’t stop chatting to“real” people just because you have a
chatbot. Think of a chatbot as a new friend who is rather different in their
conversational style from everyone else you know.
Q  Can I
converse with the chatbot about almost anything?
A  Yes. Each of our chatbots
has a very wide-ranging knowledge of the world, as well as knowledge about
things and common-sense knowledge.
Q  How
clever are the chatbots?
A  The chatbots are clever enough to be
able to conduct unlimited conversations with you about a wide range of
subjects, and they will make you believe that they understand you.
Q  What
exactly is the Loebner prize?
A  It is an annual prize
competition, founded in 1991 by a New
  York entrepreneur, Dr Hugh Loebner, to find the
world’s best conversation software. The competition is based on the famous
“Turing Test”, which was proposed by Alan
Turing, one of the founding fathers of Artificial Intelligence. See for
example
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test

Q  Why are you trying to raise funds on Indiegogo
rather than through traditional investors?
A  During the past couple of
years or so crowdfunding has taken off as the modern way for start-ups to raise
funds. It is quicker and easier to launch a crowdfunding campaign than to
prepare all of the documentation needed and go through all the bureaucratic
processes associated with traditional investor funding. And one very big
advantage of crowdfunding is that the “crowd” becomes the basis for a community
of enthusiasts – people who genuinely like the idea of the project.
Q  What's
in it for me if I donate?
 A  Each of our perks for a pledge of
$10 ore more will bring you one or more gifts as soon as our Indiegogo campaign
ends on July 31st 2015. Later, once we have developed the four
launch versions of our chatbot, you will receive at least one of them and
possibly more than one (so you can gift to your friends if you wish), according
to how much you have pledged. And if you would like to give us hands-on
assistance to improve our chatbots you can accept our invitation to send us
snippets of some of your conversations with your chatbot, together with your
comments, suggestions, and any criticisms. 
Q  Will
I be able to own a chatbot if I donate?
A  Yes.
Provided you donate $10 or more, your perks will include a chatbot (or possibly
more than one, depending on how much you have pledged).
Q  For how
long will I get a chatbot if I donate?
A  You
may keep and use it forever.
Q  Can I
gift a chatbot to a friend?
A  Yes – you can specify the user’s email
address to which (each of) your chatbot(s) should be sent.  And if you wish to gift one of our
personalized chatbots to a friend, then when we notify you that we’ve completed
the core of our development work you can send us your completed personalizing
questionnaire(s) together with your friend’s email address. 
Q  What will
be the differences between the app chatbots and whatever online interactive
services you plan to launch later?

A  The
online interactive services will provide a few more features than the apps, and
there will be very modest monthly charges for their use.

Thank you!

We would like to say a big “Thank you” to everyone who
pledges to our Indiegogo campaign. It is you who are helping to bring our project
to life. With time we hope and expect that tens of thousands of people or more will
enjoy and benefit from their conversations with our erotic chatbots, and you
will have helped them to do so.

which are part of the Carpathian Mountains. The Romainian Sphinx was 
formed solely by<br/>natural erosion and appears as a human figure only when
 viewed from this particular angle.Situated at an altitude of 2.216 meters, the easiest way to get there is by a 15 minutes ride with the gondola lift. <br/>It is believed the Sphinx is a 
representation of the supreme divinity of an ancient people, the 
Pelasgi,ancestors of greeks. They were a pre-Indo-European tribe who lived near the Aegean 
Sea, until the Greek tribes'migration up to Eland, Small Asia and Egypt.
Many historians believe the Egyptian Sphinx in Gizeh is a copy of the 
Sphinx on the Bucegi Platform because of its resemblance to Zeus.<br/>Daniel Ruzo, a peruvian explorer, launched a theory in 1968. He claimed 
he had found a link between this Sphinx of Romania, the Dacian people 
(ancient civilisation that lived here before the roman invasion) and the
 Markawasi civilisation. He said that he had found some similarities 
between the Sphinx in Bucegi Mountains and other rock formation in the 
Andes. <br/><br/><h2>1/3 of mineral and thermal waters of Europe

country based on a constant potential, very complex, practically 
inexhaustible. Romania is one of Europe’s richest and most remarkable 
countries in terms of natural healing factors. It is home to more than 
one third of Europe’s mineral and thermal springs.<br/>Started by Romans and unique in Europe. Today Romania’s 70 natural spas 
provide relief for many medical disorders and illnesses.<br/>
The therapeutic value of the natural cures available in Romania has been
 recognised by ancient times. Even today, at many Romanian spa resorts you will find 
two-thousand-year-old vestiges of ancient baths. The Thermae Herculi, 
nowadays called Båile Herculane, was famous throughout the<br/>
Roman Empire for the curative properties of its mineral waters.</p>

With a terrain that ranges from steep and challenging to gentle and 
pleasant, Romania offers bikers of all skills and levels something to 
enjoy along its bike trails. Magnificent scenery offered by trails 
through woods or traditional villages invite bikers to stop quite often.
Romania’s Carpathian mountains and rural areas offer excellent possibilities for Horseback Riding vacations.
SKIING
A third of the country’s area is covered by the Carpathian Mountains, 
which makes Romania a preferred travel destination for lovers of 
wintersports. Prahovei Valley has several ski slopes with various levels
 of difficulty, served by chair and T-bar ski lifts.
CAVING TOURS

Romania is proud with Emil Racovita, founder of the 1st Speleological 
Institute in the world, and represents a first class caving destination 
with an impressive number of caves (1/3 of Europe’s caves, more than 
12.000 caves), many of which have never been properly explored. Movile Cave has shocked the entire scientific world was in fact the weird ecosystem found inside. The unusual Movile Cave, Romania is the only place on Earth where is an ecosystem whose life is based on chemosynthesis (life without oxygen). 
SALT MINES
Romania has many Salt Mines.
Known as the biggest salt mine in Europe, Slanic Prahova stands today for one of the most important watering and climatic resorts in Romania.It is formed by 14 rooms, with a total surface of 90.000 sqm. The height
 of the walls inside reach 60 meters. The sanatorium inside has a 
capacity of 50 beds and a wide variety of medical services is being 
offered there.
Near pretty much nothing you've ever heard of sits the world's largest salt mine museum:Turda Salt Mine.
It was converted into a museum in 1992, where visitors can descend as far as 400 feet to hang out at the mine's ferris wheel, bowling alley, mini golf course, amphitheater and, oh, take a boat ride on the lake. 


Experts claim that microclimate also 
offers health benefits especially for people with respiratory 
difficulties and has a constant temperature of around 12°C and are used as treatment centers.It is an eeire place not only different from everything you have seen 
before, but also good for your health. The air is perfect for the lungs 
and there are treatments done here for a array of affections from lungs 
to ears, throat and detox.The Mud Volcanoes. Lunar view near Buzau
Extremely rare in the world, the mud volcanoes give the area a lunar 
tone and form fantastic images in a scenery taken from another world.The Berca Mud Volcanoes are a geological and botanical reservation located in the Berca commune in the Buzau County . Its
 most spectacular feature is the mud volcanoes, small volcano-shaped 
structures typically a few metres high caused by the eruption of mud and
 natural gases.Romanian Sphinx 

The Romanian Sphinx is a natural rock formation on the Bucegi Mountains 
which are part of the Carpathian Mountains. The Romainian Sphinx was 
formed solely bynatural erosion and appears as a human figure only when
 viewed from this particular angle.Situated at an altitude of 2.216 meters, the easiest way to get there is by a 15 minutes ride with the gondola lift. It is believed the Sphinx is a 
representation of the supreme divinity of an ancient people, the 
Pelasgi,ancestors of greeks. They were a pre-Indo-European tribe who lived near the Aegean 
Sea, until the Greek tribes'migration up to Eland, Small Asia and Egypt.
Many historians believe the Egyptian Sphinx in Gizeh is a copy of the 
Sphinx on the Bucegi Platform because of its resemblance to Zeus.Daniel Ruzo, a peruvian explorer, launched a theory in 1968. He claimed 
he had found a link between this Sphinx of Romania, the Dacian people 
(ancient civilisation that lived here before the roman invasion) and the
 Markawasi civilisation. He said that he had found some similarities 
between the Sphinx in Bucegi Mountains and other rock formation in the 
Andes. 1/3 of mineral and thermal waters of Europe 



The health tourism is the only form of tourism of our 
country based on a constant potential, very complex, practically 
inexhaustible. Romania is one of Europe’s richest and most remarkable 
countries in terms of natural healing factors. It is home to more than 
one third of Europe’s mineral and thermal springs.Started by Romans and unique in Europe. Today Romania’s 70 natural spas 
provide relief for many medical disorders and illnesses.
The therapeutic value of the natural cures available in Romania has been
 recognised by ancient times. Even today, at many Romanian spa resorts you will find 
two-thousand-year-old vestiges of ancient baths. The Thermae Herculi, 
nowadays called Båile Herculane, was famous throughout the
Roman Empire for the curative properties of its mineral waters.
A land of natural beauty

</h3>
<div>Unlike tablets and phones, dedicated e-readers don’t distract you with social media, emails, and text messages. They don’t beep at you or tire your eyes when you read for hours at a time. By design, e-readers are purpose-built for reading and create a sanctuary so you can lose yourself in a book. <br/>
</div>The big trend in e-reader development over the course of the last four years is the dwindling of innovative spirit. Companies have been <a href=""http://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/e-readers-the-race-to-the-bottom"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">racing to the bottom</a>, designing and selling the cheapest device possible.  <br/><br/>People often have to settle for an e-reader that gets the job done, instead of something they truly want to buy. Every day someone emails Good e-Reader imploring us to launch a crowd funded campaign to design and manufacture the perfect e-reader. We have finally listened and today we would like to announce the Ultimate e-Reader. <br/><br/><h1><b>Power and Beauty</b></h1>
<p></p>
<p>When we set out to design the Ultimate e-reader, we wanted to employ Google Android in order to give users the ability to craft their own digital reading experience. All of the major e-readers on the market lock you into a specific ecosystem and make it very difficult to do business with other companies.  Our device will let you easily use your favorite e-reading app such as Moon + Reader, Kindle, Kobo, Nook and thousands of others. <br/></p>
<p>It critically important to us that we feature hardware that will give the user a great experience.  The Ultimate e-reader leverages the Freescale 1 GHZ  processor, which is the most energy efficient ARM processor ever developed –
to deliver innovative  features like a new battery savings mode, which gives you longer battery life, on a smaller battery. </p>
<p>Our e-reader has the exact same specs as the Amazon Kindle Voyage and the Kobo GLO HD, and absolutely destroys all of the sub-par e-readers of the world, such as the ones issued by Onyx, Pocketbook and Ectaco. The goal, is to give you hardware as good as Amazon or Kobo, at a great price and runs Android!<br/></p>

</div> </div>","The First Crowd-Sourced e-Reader

Unlike tablets and phones, dedicated e-readers don’t distract you with social media, emails, and text messages. They don’t beep at you or tire your eyes when you read for hours at a time. By design, e-readers are purpose-built for reading and create a sanctuary so you can lose yourself in a book. 
The big trend in e-reader development over the course of the last four years is the dwindling of innovative spirit. Companies have been racing to the bottom, designing and selling the cheapest device possible.  People often have to settle for an e-reader that gets the job done, instead of something they truly want to buy. Every day someone emails Good e-Reader imploring us to launch a crowd funded campaign to design and manufacture the perfect e-reader. We have finally listened and today we would like to announce the Ultimate e-Reader. Power and Beauty

When we set out to design the Ultimate e-reader, we wanted to employ Google Android in order to give users the ability to craft their own digital reading experience. All of the major e-readers on the market lock you into a specific ecosystem and make it very difficult to do business with other companies.  Our device will let you easily use your favorite e-reading app such as Moon + Reader, Kindle, Kobo, Nook and thousands of others. 
It critically important to us that we feature hardware that will give the user a great experience.  The Ultimate e-reader leverages the Freescale 1 GHZ  processor, which is the most energy efficient ARM processor ever developed –
to deliver innovative  features like a new battery savings mode, which gives you longer battery life, on a smaller battery. 
Our e-reader has the exact same specs as the Amazon Kindle Voyage and the Kobo GLO HD, and absolutely destroys all of the sub-par e-readers of the world, such as the ones issued by Onyx, Pocketbook and Ectaco. The goal, is to give you hardware as good as Amazon or Kobo, at a great price and runs Android!
Want to get a sense of our device stacks up against the competition? 










The Specs


Screen: Six Inch E Ink Carta Display using Regal Waveform


Resolution: 1430 x 1080 pixels and 300 PPI


Touchscreen Panel - Neonode IR Touch - Works with a Stylus


Processor: i.MX
6 Solo Lite 1 GHZ Processor


RAM– 512 MB


Internal Memory– 8 GB and no limits for user loaded content


MicroSD - Supports up to 32 GB of additional data to store e-books and apps


Front Lit Display– People want to read in the dark and a solid front-lit display is critical.


Battery– BC3770: 2A Switch-Mode Li-ion/Li-polymer Battery Charger – 8,000 page turns or 2 months.


OS– Android 6 Marshmallow - Open Source, install your own apps. 


App Store - This device will ship with the first App Store designed for e-Ink, providing access to every e-reader app you can imagine.

We are using E
 Ink Carta to power the Ultimate e-Reader because it delivers a dramatic 50% increase in contrast over earlier 
generations of e-Paper. The crisp text and detailed graphics are also highly 
readable in direct sunlight. Carta's 16 levels of grey produce the 
sharpest rendering of images with smooth tones and rich detail. We have also eliminated the need for full page refreshes every page, giving you a more immersive reading experience. 


The First App Store Designed for  E INK

There have been a few companies in the past that offer Android e-readers, but often force users to hunt around for their own apps. The Good e-reader Android App Store was the first app store in the world to be optimized to run on e-ink readers. This allows anyone to download over 37,000 apps, such as e-books, dictionaries, magazines, newspapers, manga,  and graphic novels. Android allows you to craft your own experience. Want to download both Kindle and Kobo to read past purchases? You can do that.  Want to take a break from reading and play Words with Friends? You can do that too.  Do you want to install your own wallpapers, screensavers or install widgets? There are no limits, no walled garden, and no gatekeeper.The Good e-Reader App Store will be loaded on the Ultimate e-reader as your online destination to download and install free apps. 
Perfect for Libraries and e-books


The Ultimate e-reader is the perfect solution for the modern library, where 95% of all US locations have an e-book collection. The Ultimate e-reader is running Android, which gives libraries the ability to loan this unit out to their patrons or have it available at their branches. 
The Ultimate e-reader can run Overdrive, Axis 360, 3M Cloud Library and many others. This is the first e-ink e-reader that is compatible with these companies apps, making it unique in the market.
One of our upcoming perks will have an USB to 3.5mm headphone jack audio cable, which will allow you to not only read e-books but listen to audiobooks too.

<p>Following up on our last crowd funding venture on Indiegogo, we realised maybe let's try again: a smaller goal, with smaller amounts and then take it to the bank! So far we've raised €500+. This sits in our bank account. With some more funding and money from an investor we can approach the bank for a loan to get up, start running and making darker skinned cosmetic wearers happier. So here's us asking for your help in finding €3500 more.</p>
<p>Having worked with various large cosmetic companies/brands I've always been aware of the mismatched creations for the Darker skin types. It is my passion to provide the Darker skin with make-up that looks natural when it is worn. Not just to provide this make-up, but to also teach wearers about make-up selection, suitability and application.</p>
<p>PerfectFaces is in the process of creating cosmetic make-up that is actually suitable for Darker skin tones. Realistically the market is swamped with options, but 94% of the available options do not actually satisfy the cosmetic and knowledge needs of Darker cosmetic users.......................this is where PerfectFaces fits into the 'square peg'.

<p>The struggle for good make-up in the Dark-skinned community has been on-going. To create make-up for Darker skin is time consuming and an expensive venture. Most companies either don't have the in-depth knowledge of the skin needs or refuse to invest much, as it would cut into their profits.</p>

<p><b>Evo A&amp;A</b><br/></p>
<p>We're a small group of friends intent on opening a proper metal
shop. We have a lot of tools already, but we need two specific,
expensive pieces of equipment that we don't have or have access to
yet. We're teachers, welders, accountants, seamstresses, mathematicians, law
students, ne'er do wells, activists and trouble makers
extraordinaire. Together we have the skills and conviction to make this work; and we've already started, doing research and development for this project!<br/></p>
<p>Our plan is to open shop selling steel plate body armor, because
we have almost all of the equipment we need to do it, and it's
currently in high demand. It'd let us immediately start generating
revenue, so we can give more of our time to the shop and invest in
more and better equipment to expand our range of work. Some day, we
hope to operate full time as a professional small-run parts shop,
part of the community of contract-work shops here in Pierce and King
counties servicing Boeing and the local shipyards.</p>
<p>We'll be organized as a worker-owned cooperative, a closed IWW
shop (pending successful negotiations with the IWW to admit us*)
bringing money and jobs into our neighborhood, and accumulating means
of production owned and controlled by working class people, not
wealthy share holders.</p>
<p>If we meet our goal, we'll be open for business and putting food
on the table for two families on day one, manufacturing parts and
expanding as soon as possible.</p>

<p>$6,000 for shipping the perks, shipping materials (boxes, bubble wrap,

<p>$2,000 for personal expenses (we'll have to take time off our
9-to-5 jobs to make this happen, the shop won't run itself!)</p>

We print. We send thousands of books to Ohio prisoners. We host over 100 art, theater, and music events each year.  We bring in national and international speakers and provide meeting space for marginalized voices to change the political landscape in Cleveland.  Collectively, these programs create space to learn, share, and act on new ideas.</p><br/><p>We’re not asking for a handout to fund these programs.  We’re asking you to invest in equipment and supplies for the launch of a profitable publishing business that will immediately create jobs and fund our community programming. </p><br/><p>We’ve tested ourselves and our market.  Last year we launched GTK Press as a pilot project on used equipment.  We trained five employees in the craft of designing, editing, printing, binding, and publishing.  GTK Press has grown to include in-house creative and non-fiction imprints, as well as a commercial publishing division.  </p><br/><p>We know we can do this. Emerging and internationally renowned authors are choosing GTK Press for our artistic aesthetic, editorial integrity, and finely crafted product.  We have backorders of books waiting to be published.  Through experimentation and ingenuity, our prices are below big name competitors, with higher quality.  We have developed a custom online platform for ordering printing services that, along with dedicated staff, will greatly expand our marketing reach.</p><br/><p>Now we need your help.  To expand GTK Press, create jobs, and further our community impact, we need new binding equipment and a larger, first floor space for production.  The binder we used in our pilot phase is now irreparably broken, halting our ability to bind books in-house, putting our staff out of work, and drastically reducing our revenue to fund community programing.  We have grown out of our current storefront, and can not expand our press operations in our already cramped basement. </p><br/><p>You can help put good people to work.  The core of our expansion plan involves purchasing a higher quality, more automated binder that will be able to produce 350 books per hour, seven times our previous capacity.  This increased capacity, coupled with the nearly twenty commercial book printing jobs we’ve secured for the next twelve months, will allow us to triple our business income over the previous year.  A $5,000 grant from JUMPSTART INC allowed us to start the process of press expansion, and with this additional campaign we will be able to triple the hours for the five staff members that have been trained in artisan binding techniques, as well as train at least two new employees in the next year. Ultimately we hope to build up our print operation to employ 20 workers full time. </p><br/><p>You can help us grow.  We are working with community partners to move to a new storefront in the Detroit Shoreway neighborhood with approximately 3,000 square feet of first floor retail and production space.  This will allow us to bring order and organization to our growing collection of new and used books, provide a larger event space, and house our expanded printing and publishing division.  Moving to a first-floor space will make our store fully wheelchair accessible, and eliminate the need to move heavy equipment to our current basement space. </p><br/><p><b>Your investment will be immediately put to use for the following:</b></p><ul>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>Please allow us to introduce ourselves. We are a group of friends from various places around the world. We have a dream: To create a true social community that really takes care of its members. A social community that relies on its members in its decision making. One that grows alongside each and every member. We know that many have had a similar dream. They have tried but in the end they have only created clones of other social networks and eventually faded away.</p>
<p>We hope you will take some time to read about our project and learn how our vision is unique. This is a rare opportunity to experience the warmth and kinship of being a part of a true community that sincerely cares for you: <b>safety, childer protection, easy sharing, medical health</b>, <b>augmented reality</b>.  Come join us on this incredible journey as we push the limits of social networking. Together, we can build something the world has never seen before. We couldn't do what we do without your support!  We are looking towards the future, with you on board.  Simply put: We want you on our team!</p>

there, and welcome to the <b><i>Sullivan Hot Sauce Trading Company, Indiegogo Campaign. </i></b>My name is Isaiah Sullivan and I am the owner and
creator of this delicious, unique, and innovative hot sauce brand. I started
the company over a year ago in Stockholm, Sweden, as a side job, while studying
for my master’s in political science and taking parental leave. I am passionate
about politics and even more about hot sauce. I grew up on St. Thomas, in the US
Virgin Islands and learned the art of making hot sauce from my great-aunt,
Hyacinth (Hyo); she always warned the children “don’t touch the peppers…they hot, hot, hot”; I tell my daughter the same thing. The recipe is my creation, the design and logo by the genius of my 
brother-in-law, Gustav Schultz, and the awesome and constant 
encouragement from my wife Ellen and daughter Maya. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438725891/wkohg1hkopwnccvobjzn.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 155.25px; height: 207px;""/>(My daughter and I selling the hot sauce at market)<br/></p><i><b><br/><br/></b></i><p></p><p></p><i><b><i><b>The Story of the Sauce...</b></i></b></i><br/>Over
the years I’ve perfected the art of making a well-balanced habanero-based hot
sauce. I use habaneros because they have a nice fruity character and pleasant
heat. The other ingredients are there to accent, not over-power, <b><i>Sullivan
Hot Sauce</i></b>. There are hints of citrus, a delicate sweetness and
thickness from carrots and aromatic ingredients such as garlic, red onions, and
ginger. Finally, the sauce is slow-cooked, with olive oil and a special
ingredient to add to the uniqueness of the flavor; cooled down, stabilized
with white wine vinegar (but not too much, as it is hot sauce, not vinegar
sauce) and bottled. Everything is done by hand to achieve a detail oriented and

<br/></div>","(Inspecting the habanero peppers; they look nice!)Hi
there, and welcome to the Sullivan Hot Sauce Trading Company, Indiegogo Campaign. My name is Isaiah Sullivan and I am the owner and
creator of this delicious, unique, and innovative hot sauce brand. I started
the company over a year ago in Stockholm, Sweden, as a side job, while studying
for my master’s in political science and taking parental leave. I am passionate
about politics and even more about hot sauce. I grew up on St. Thomas, in the US
Virgin Islands and learned the art of making hot sauce from my great-aunt,
Hyacinth (Hyo); she always warned the children “don’t touch the peppers…they hot, hot, hot”; I tell my daughter the same thing. The recipe is my creation, the design and logo by the genius of my 
brother-in-law, Gustav Schultz, and the awesome and constant 
encouragement from my wife Ellen and daughter Maya. (My daughter and I selling the hot sauce at market)The Story of the Sauce...Over
the years I’ve perfected the art of making a well-balanced habanero-based hot
sauce. I use habaneros because they have a nice fruity character and pleasant
heat. The other ingredients are there to accent, not over-power, Sullivan
Hot Sauce. There are hints of citrus, a delicate sweetness and
thickness from carrots and aromatic ingredients such as garlic, red onions, and
ginger. Finally, the sauce is slow-cooked, with olive oil and a special
ingredient to add to the uniqueness of the flavor; cooled down, stabilized
with white wine vinegar (but not too much, as it is hot sauce, not vinegar
sauce) and bottled. Everything is done by hand to achieve a detail oriented and
quality product that you may just fall in love with; or at least your mouth
will. It goes great with everything: eggs, vegetarian dishes (its 100% vegan), meat, fish, and poultry; and even cocktails (adds great flavor to Bloody Mary's). Spice up your life with Sullivan Hot Sauce!Now
to the campaign…Indiegogo! I believe this opportunity will allow me to expand
the reach of my product throughout Sweden, to the US (which has a large hot
sauce market), and globally. There are necessary steps for this to happen: 


 I need a bigger kitchen and

roughly 4,500 bottles at a time (minimum order). This would be the optimum

above calculations based on current cost of production, inflation and price fluctuation taking into account.

The Impact of Sullivan Hot Sauce Trading
Company


 I will do my best to aim
towards getting fair-trade produce and ingredients.

I believe that an integral
part of the ingredients should be that they are sourced through fair and environmentally
minded practices, to both include the healthy and sustainable lives of the
farmers (no slave or child labor) and their environment around them. 

The funding will be used to
increase this part of my mission and aim towards fair-trade labeling. 


At the moment most of the
ingredients are from Europe, but I would like to support more community based
farming in the future, especially for the habanero peppers, which tend to be
grown in various parts of the Caribbean (which I'm from) and regions of Western Africa. 

Hurdles, Risk and Challenges 



There are always going to be
risk and obstacles to any growing business.


I experienced this in my first
year (summer 2015) where the weather is not always on your side; so instead of
simply selling direct to people (at local market in Stockholm, Sweden).


The aim was to get it into
stores, or even deliver them if need be by bicycle (in Stockholm only), this has been done by foot though (during snowy-winter months).



My phone number has been on

much they love the sauce, or that they’re out and need more, or that the heat
needs to increase. 



However, bigger problems such
as lower quality habaneros have occurred and I immediately send the whole
shipment back and request, hand-examined and perfect ingredients. 


Another pitfall was caps that
had a malfunction, which was quickly remedied by my bottle and cap supplier, by
overnight delivery. 


One foreseeable challenge will be ensuring quick, reliable, and efficient international shipment from Sweden.
I will make this one of my main goals, to ensure that a perfect bottle, or three, or six, or how ever many you would like, to spice up your life, gets to you in a reasonable amount of time. 
Another difficult hurdle is pricing properly, so that I may get the product to bigger stores, and thus increase the supply and demand. 

The cost of production is the most difficult part of this equation; the more I can make, the better the cost gets, thus, more potential for increased supply and profit. This is where an investment would help the most. 

The biggest challenge will be to keep up with the demand; that is why this campaign will help me to increase my production potential and staff to ensure that Sullivan Hot Sauce Trading Company grows to its full potential. 


Great, Now Here’s Other Ways You Can Help


 I understand in this economic
climate, one can’t always give.


However, we all have smart
phones, and those little gadgets have cameras, and a whole-lot-of other gadgets
and apps that can spread campaigns faster than a noonday protest rally.

<p>The original story from October 2015:</p>
<p>We are Cascadia Grove of Ár nDraíocht Féin: A Druid Fellowship (ADF).  We are building a Shrine to Cernunnos, God of Liminality, Commerce, and the Forest, at White Mountain Druid Sanctuary in Trout Lake, Washington state. <br/></p>

<i>Artist rendering of proposed Cernunnos shrine.  All artwork will be done in full color.</i><div>
<i><br/></i><p>White Mountain Druid Sanctuary is created and owned by Kirk Thomas, the Arch Druid of ADF.  On the Sanctuary’s property, he has already completed three shrines, a massive Stone Circle, and a Labyrinth.  To create these physical structures to withstand time, they have to be built with durable products.  The stone and metal roofing, as well as the tile artwork, cost money.  This is where you come in.<br/></p>

<p>We will be building an outdoor shrine made to withstand harsh winters and heavy snows.  The shrine will be constructed with wood pillars, concrete walls and a reinforced sheet metal roof - all forming a sheltered area that includes a granite shelf for lighting and placing incense and other offerings.  There will also be a fire altar and an oak tree wooden bench for meditation.  </p>

December 2015: THANKS to everyone who contributed so far!!  We will break ground in the spring to start building the Shrine.  The plan right now, is to go live with another campaign at that time and perhaps a third one at the completion.  You will have a bit more time to contribute your own engraved brick or tile.  Check back with us in a couple months after the snow melts in Trout Lake, Washington.  
The original story from October 2015:
We are Cascadia Grove of Ár nDraíocht Féin: A Druid Fellowship (ADF).  We are building a Shrine to Cernunnos, God of Liminality, Commerce, and the Forest, at White Mountain Druid Sanctuary in Trout Lake, Washington state. 


Artist rendering of proposed Cernunnos shrine.  All artwork will be done in full color.
White Mountain Druid Sanctuary is created and owned by Kirk Thomas, the Arch Druid of ADF.  On the Sanctuary’s property, he has already completed three shrines, a massive Stone Circle, and a Labyrinth.  To create these physical structures to withstand time, they have to be built with durable products.  The stone and metal roofing, as well as the tile artwork, cost money.  This is where you come in.

We will be building an outdoor shrine made to withstand harsh winters and heavy snows.  The shrine will be constructed with wood pillars, concrete walls and a reinforced sheet metal roof - all forming a sheltered area that includes a granite shelf for lighting and placing incense and other offerings.  There will also be a fire altar and an oak tree wooden bench for meditation.  


Shrine to The Dagda, Irish god of Appetite
Cernunnos’ shrine will be added to a collection of shrines of the Irish and Celtic pantheons.  Already completed are shrines to The Dagda (above), The Morrigan and Lugh.  (Pictures below).

Shrine to Lugh, Irish god of Many Talents
They are placed around a Stone Circle (below) that has twelve 10- 20 foot pillars, a Well, a Fire Pit, and an Axis Mundi.

There is also a Bed and Breakfast (Trout Lake Abbey) on the property.  People can reserve an individual room, a bed in the hostel, or places to camp and pitch a tent.  (Picture below)


Trout Lake Abbey B&B


White Mountain Druid Sanctuary is one of the few places in the country that has imagined and created an environment similar to what we believe our ancient ancestors worshiped in, and then placed it in a modern setting.  Grounded in what we know from artifacts and written history, ADF has created rituals that honor the Indo-European pantheons of old.  At White Mountain Druid Sanctuary, we are creating a place in which we can honor the Gods and Goddesses of old, the Nature Spirits, and our Ancestors.

One definite peace of mind you have as a contributor is that a significant amount of work has already been completed on other shrines.  We already know exactly how to get the work done and we’ve already been successful at doing this before.

If you can’t contribute now, here’s how you can still help.  Tell your friends!  Come and visit!  Trout Lake Abbey exists for people to visit, wander the Labyrinth and the Stone Circle, and make offerings at the shrines.  And did we mention the unobstructed breathtaking view of Mt Adams?  (below)



View from the Trout Lake Abbey B&B
Construction of the Cernunnos shrine is scheduled to start spring 2016 as soon as the ground thaws from the winter.  Stretch goals will include a shrine to Manannan Mac Lir, Rhiannon, Brigid, an Ancestor Mound, a temple to the All Gods, and yes, we have plans for even more.

It's a great story!!! The name came to Tracy while she was visiting a womens homeless shelter in The Bronx. While visiting, Tracy noticed that the director would stop and talk to every woman she passed in the hallways and would hug them and tell them YOU ARE AMAZING or YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, etc So Tracy shortened it to U.R. and will be naming every product things like AMAZING or BEAUTIFUL or... You get the theme right? After 4 years in the bath and body industry we feel we are ready to conquer the world of Bath and Body Products as well as helping the homeless and those in need along the way. The original company was formed in Tracy's kitchen 4 years ago after a devastating layoff and being a single mother of 2 wonderful boys there was no room for failure and the company was launched with only soaps to support the family. With a $32.00 investment Tracy was able to put her soaps in over 1000 stores in less than a year. Saving as much money as possible while raising a high level hockey player that traveled the country and an up and coming young golfer, Tracy was able to move into a manufacturing facility in October of 2014. Investing everything she made into equipment and supplies for an expanded product line to include Soaps, Sugar Scrubs, Lotions, Body Butters, Bubble Bath, Perfumes, Lip Balms, etc as well as opening the first retail store. As fate would have it, on May 5th, everything Tracy had worked toward was destroyed during an evening of Oklahoma tornadoes and flooding. Inventory worth over $200,000.00 was destroyed. Not willing to give up, Tracy is moving her business and products in a new direction. Tracy started her company from a mere $32.00 with less than $100.00 in the bank at the time. It was a moment of do or die. Homeless and unable to support her children was the only other option but Tracy is a fierce survivor and was determined to succeed. Knowing that there are other people in the world that might not have been so fortunate she is going to begin the new business with the mission of employing and helping the homeless. There are millions of homeless mothers in shelters all over the United States that simply need an opportunity to succeed and in return allows them to raise more productive and happy children that deserve the life and opportunities that Tracy has been able to afford her children with both on track for Division 1 academic and sports scholarships.</p><p> With a tremendous amount of support from Homeless Missions in New York City, New Orleans and Las Vegas we are ready to start our adventure.  U.R. Bath and Body will employee homeless employees for retail, manufacturing and shipping in hopes of helping them become productive and begin to live life on their own and successfully again.</p><p> In 2016 we would like to begin expansion of U.R. Bath and Body. Not in a normal way though. In an attempt to make someone else's entrepreneurial dreams come true, we are partnering with several non profit organizations as well as a reality show producer to go on a search for people that are capable and deserving of owning their own U.R. Bath and Body franchise. With support we can provide the start up capital for this candidate to open and operate their very own franchise store. We will offer 2 stores per state and will go on a fierce search for the most deserving, willing and capable candidates. We will search homeless shelters, battered womens shelters, it might be a disabled veteran or it might be you!!!! Our first 6 stores will be in Las Vegas NV, New Orleans LA, Memphis TN, Boston MA, Atlanta GA and Dallas TX.  There are many options for financing and investors but we would rather offer our friends and valued customers the opportunity to help us grow. Most investors want a percentage of the company and investors are all about the money that they will make rather than the mission of the company. We love what we do and don't want to turn into a corporate ran company. We want to remain a handmade company that serves the community. With your help we can accomplish just that.  We don't want something for nothing but a head start on our growth. We will spend the money we raise to replace and increase inventory, hire employees and fund our expansion stores. Everyone  will receive their products just in time for Christmas!!!  Here is a little video about our owner Tracy.  Since the video we have changed the name of the company to a name that is more meaningful to our mission.  Thank you so very much for your time and thank you in advance for you support.  </p><p> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5XEWU5Dn6Y&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5XEWU5Dn6Y&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p><p>Here is a link to our Facebook page</p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/URbathandbody"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/URbathandbody</a></p><br/></div>","U.R.

<p>Brewyard Beer
Company will be Glendale, California’s 1st Craft Brewery &amp; Taproom! We are
located at 906 Western Avenue right off San Fernando Road.  The addition of our brewery along San Fernando
Rd. will help create the “San Fernando Road Craft Beer Corridor” where great
Los Angeles breweries like Golden Road Brewery and Eagle Rock brewery are
located.  Along the Glendale-Eagle Rock
stretch of San Fernando Road is also home to great Craft Beer Bars such as
Glendale Tap, Verdugo Bar, and Story Tavern. 
</p>
<p>We will be
dedicated to brewing unique and fresh high-quality awesome beers, following
suit of great American craft beer cities such as San Diego, Denver, and Chicago,
serving fresh from our brewery tanks in our on-site taproom.  We will also self-distribute to premium bars,
gastro pubs, taverns, clubs, and restaurants all throughout California.  </p><p><span>The first 4 beers we will be brewing are: California Common Lager (Steam Beer), Passion fruit Saison, Black Schwarzbier Lager &amp; an</span><span><span> IPL (India Pale Lager). Although we will be brewing popular styles like IPAs, Stouts, porters..etc, we will mostly be brewing Hybrid Ale/Lagers that have the flavor profiles of Ales but with the cleaner finishes that lagers have.</span></span><br/></p>
<p>Our taproom
will also be a space for local artists and performers to showcase their work
giving them another avenue for local exposure. The City of Glendale has been
generous enough to grant us a Conditional Use Permit that will allow for Food
trucks, music, and even live entertainment (on occasion with an approved
permit). </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p>We set some very ambitious
goals for our Brewery &amp; Taproom to make sure craft beer fans can experience
the finest beers and the best atmosphere to drink them in.  With the help from our families, friends, and
our contractor, we have managed to get our brewery 90% there, provided the
budget we had to work with.  The last 10%
will help us open our doors!  With your
help and a very humble goal of $25,000 we will be able to finish up our
taproom, purchase our much needed ingredients(grains/hops/yeast) for our opening
batches, purchase brewing and taproom equipment (Kegs, NSF shelving, glassware,
growlers, cleaning supplies/chemicals, storage racks, transfer pump, hoses, fittings,
gloves, boots, and oh… more kegs). With your help we will also be able to focus
our efforts towards marketing, website design, and provide better options for
Brewyard Apparel/Accessories.  </p>
<p>If we can surpass
our goal, the extra money will go towards items that we had to remove from our
initial build-out budget.  An extra
$25,000-$50,000 past our goal will allow us to startup our barrel-age program, special-release
bottling, install a proper A/C system(or at least repair &amp; upgrade our ancient
Swamp Cooling system) in the brewery and even purchase more fermentation tanks
to bring you more beer!  </p>

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We, along with our
friends and family, have already invested a tremendous amount of our lives into
building out this dream.  We started out
8 years ago as home brewers brewing up small batches of beer from our garage.
With our lifesavings, help and support from our families and an SBA loan we
managed to get this project started.  The
City of Glendale has been fully supportive of our endeavor and we have the
opportunity to be the city’s first Craft Brewery.  Just last week we received our CA ABC license
to brew and sell beer.  It would be an
understatement to say that we feel a certain amount of pressure and obligation
to make sure we don’t disappoint ourselves, our city, and the craft beer
community all around.  We want our
brewery to be successful not just for our own personal satisfaction but so we
can be in a position to return the thanks to everyone that helped us along the
way and to the city and community that welcomed us with open arms.  Oh and we also want to brew the best beer in
the world.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The Good news: Our
overall construction is almost done.  We
still have some ways to complete the finish work in the taproom but it
shouldn’t affect our time frame to open nor final city inspection.  This past month we received our Alcohol
license and last March, the City of Glendale granted us a Conditional Use Permit
to serve beer on-premise in our taproom. 
In terms of permitting and buildout, a majority of the most risky items
have been taken care of…*Phew* </p>
<p>Now, the majority of
our challenges/risks shift to opening and operating the brewery.  This is where you come in.  The funds that we raise will directly
determine how much risk we have to deal with. 
Our $25,000 goal should reduce that risk tremendously by allowing us to
immediately purchase items we need to brew beer, finish our taproom, and open
doors.  You may or may not have heard but
the prices for raw materials such as hops are skyrocketing due to
shortages.  This campaign will also help
pay for rent and utilities so we don’t get evicted from our space while
preparing to open.  </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can
Help</b></p>
<p>We understand if
money is tight.  Of course we do! Why do
you think we are doing this fundraiser :P There are still a million ways to
show your support.  Tell your friends,

<h3>Why does SID exist?</h3>
<p>In 2012 one of SID’s founders, Craig
Vallis, attended the Cloud Identity Summit in Vail, Colorado<span>. During the summit he
realised that <b>our identities, real life and online, are the prize</b> in the
<b>fight for control of the Internet</b>. This fight for power and control over
our identities happens between governments, corporations and criminals. There
are constant attempts by criminals, companies and government legislation to
gain access to our personal and financial details. Our busy lives and the
increasingly complicated digital world mean that we have to take care of our
right to security and safety online, but nobody wants the headache of
constantly having to remember complicated login details. </span></p>
<p>Craig decided to do something
about it. He brought a team together to create the tools that let YOU <b>take
control of your online identity</b> and personal data.</p>
<p>Anti-virus programmes and spam
blockers protect you from malicious interference while you’re online. Now SID
is here to protect you from forgotten passwords, wasted time and security
worries.</p>
<p>User login on websites is an
imperfect and clumsy necessity. It’s tedious and laborious, but websites force
you to do it. They’re trying to make your online sessions as secure as
possible. You have to live with this pain until someone discovers a better
method. SID was developed to minimise your pain and maximise your convenience
and security.  </p>
<p>SID gives you <b>one account which
logs you in to all the websites you visit online. </b></p>
<p>SID’s an account that you choose,
not an account you’re forced to use because you searched for something online,
or want to use social networking, banking or e-commerce sites. SID also increases
your online security through biometrics (physical and behavioural information
about you). These are the ultimate security confirmation of your identity,
totally unique to you.  SID doesn’t track you online, and doesn’t sell
your habits and history to advertisers. The account works almost everywhere
online. It stores your personal information and allows you to grant and revoke
access to that information at any time you like. </p>
<p>SID does this all securely,
safely and simply.</p>

In 2013 we started creating SID, and after a
number of development and test cycles we've almost ready to launch it. <b>We've
also created the most incredible login experience.</b> This is SID.<p></p>
<p><b>Isn't this just a Password Manager?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>No – SID is much more than that.
Besides managing your passwords, SID gives you a hassle-free login experience
and maximum security and privacy.</p>
<p>When we created SID, we looked at
all current website authentication processes and technologies. We examined
complexity, security and convenience issues. While websites requiring logins
are only trying to make your online activity as secure as possible, many of
them fail (the TalkTalk UK data breach is a prime example). Almost all of them
fail with the most important thing: your experience as a user. SID is a
superior, convenient user experience. It takes away the dread of logging in and
the worry about protecting your details online. </p>

<br/><h3>The low-down on SID</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Your mobile phone contains
precious information about you. SID makes sure that this information is
encrypted and stored locally on your phone so that you always have access to
it. There are several ways to back up your information, so that you can easily
get it back if you lose or damage your phone. Your information is never stored
on our servers, so you’re protected from hackers and any possible technical
issue. </p>
<p>SID is a ‘set of keys’ you use to
login to any website, quickly and simply, never again having to remember a
username or password. Think of your phone as being a house, and SID is the key
to the house. Instead of having many different keys for different rooms in your
house, SID is one key which works for every door. This one key is unlike
anybody else’s, and nobody can copy it. It’s yours, and yours alone.</p>
<h4>SID - simple
enough for your parents and grandparents to use, and powerful enough for you to
use every day.</h4>

<span>Hello! We are Sean and Dana O'Connor. Parents of 4 children and no strangers to the struggles that go along with raising a family on a paycheck to paycheck basis. We went from successful retailers some years back to losing everything practically overnight which not only humbled us to the max but also opened our eyes to the fact that many, many other families and individuals were hurting and facing the same financial challenges.</span><br/>
</div><div>
</div><p>Thankfully we had a wonderful circle of support during those times and now Rescue Apparel Thrift Store is our way of paying it forward and giving our hearts to those who have little to nothing on their tables to eat. We are co-directors of a small food ministry that we work out of the parking lot of our church, providing food to all who are in need. Rescue Apparel Thrift Store will help grow the pantry to a much higher level and support another dream we both have of helping others to get back on the right track financially.</p><div>
</div><ul> </ul><p>With supporters like you, Rescue Apparel will make a giant impact in our community by using it's profits to build people back up from a place that may seem hopeless. The immediate objective is to help people when they don't have enough food, moreover granting scholarships for vocational job training which with the right amount of self confidence will keep the paychecks coming, you know the saying, give someone a fish and they'll eat for a night but teach someone to fish and they'll eat for a lifetime and this lifetime is too short to spend it strapped and unhappy.</p><p>When life hit us hard and we were the one's going through hard times, it was surely hard to ignore the tremendous amount of people that were in need of help and now we want to be part of the solution to this ongoing life problem.

</div></div>","Hello! We are Sean and Dana O'Connor. Parents of 4 children and no strangers to the struggles that go along with raising a family on a paycheck to paycheck basis. We went from successful retailers some years back to losing everything practically overnight which not only humbled us to the max but also opened our eyes to the fact that many, many other families and individuals were hurting and facing the same financial challenges.

Thankfully we had a wonderful circle of support during those times and now Rescue Apparel Thrift Store is our way of paying it forward and giving our hearts to those who have little to nothing on their tables to eat. We are co-directors of a small food ministry that we work out of the parking lot of our church, providing food to all who are in need. Rescue Apparel Thrift Store will help grow the pantry to a much higher level and support another dream we both have of helping others to get back on the right track financially.
 With supporters like you, Rescue Apparel will make a giant impact in our community by using it's profits to build people back up from a place that may seem hopeless. The immediate objective is to help people when they don't have enough food, moreover granting scholarships for vocational job training which with the right amount of self confidence will keep the paychecks coming, you know the saying, give someone a fish and they'll eat for a night but teach someone to fish and they'll eat for a lifetime and this lifetime is too short to spend it strapped and unhappy.When life hit us hard and we were the one's going through hard times, it was surely hard to ignore the tremendous amount of people that were in need of help and now we want to be part of the solution to this ongoing life problem. We want people to know that there are avenues they can take and that there's someone out there committed to helping them find that road. You, as a contributor and a store patron as well, will know that you play a part in dramatically changing a life or two, three and so on, by giving a dad the upper hand at a job interview because of his education, or a mom receiving training that doesn't end up costing thousands of dollars in student loans.We are truly grateful to all who are continually donating amazing merchandise ie, clothes, shoes, purses, jewelry, books, kitchen ware, baby stuff, furniture and lots of other interesting and fun items. Now it's time to put these awesome goods to work.

</div><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><br/></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">STORY</h3>
<div>
</div><p>Each unique region in the world has a rich tradition of adornment. Thus, every bead carries a multifaceted history — from where the bead was manufactured, where it was traded, its meaning, what it was used for, and how it has since been passed along to where it is today. The connections you make while in search of these beads continue the story.  </p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p>My
name is Celia Moret-Ferguson. As a youth, my dream was to one day open a bead
store so that I could marvel at, touch, and sort beads all day; effectually transporting
me to other parts of the world and cultures. Now as an adult, after 10 years as
a traveled professional Archaeologist and Jewelry Designer, I want to share
this vision with others. My dream now... Bead Nation. After over a year of
working with a mentor at the local Small Business Administration (<a href=""https://portlandor.score.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>SCORE</u></a>) to develop a business plan, and saving
every bit I can for inventory, I need your help to finally realize this dream! </p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p>Bead
Nation will be a mobile bead store that will transport customers to cultures
afar via its unique bead selection. Store inventory will be heavily influenced
by beads manufactured and sold from around the world purchased from vendors who
support indigenous community artisans. The store’s objectives are to offer these
unique beads to jewelry designers, beginner jewelers, and anyone who
appreciates rare world goods. While its primary service is bead retail, Bead
Nation will also sell necklaces and offer classes and workshops. </p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p>Success
of Bead Nation will be a direct result of its ability to mobilize to popular
districts and festivals, its unique inventory, as well as its pleasant and
beautiful atmosphere. The shop, designed by <a href=""http://artisanstructures.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Little Mansions</u></a><u>,</u> will inspire
creativity and foster a community where artists can relate to and encourage one
another. Bead Nation will primarily be located in a designated mobile vendor
space positioned in the now popular Alberta Arts District of Portland, Oregon
and will occasionally travel to festivals. The shop will be entirely powered by
solar energy. </p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p>Portland’s
rich mobile vendor culture has become a well-known phenomenon and is part of
what makes Portland fun, quirky, and habitable. Vendor ‘pods’ draw people and
add vibrancy to empty lots and districts. Mobile shops also afford creative
entrepreneurs the ability to establish micro-businesses while offering
customers unique options at a reasonable price. </p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p>Having
visited hundreds of bead stores and booths, I have the experience to suitably determine
fair purchasing and retail prices. Bead Nation will carry reasonably priced and
unique beads. The mobile shop will draw in jewelers, creative makers, and the general
public. With a line of high-quality stone pendants and a variety of rosary
chain, anyone can easily craft a simple, exquisite necklace. Bead Nation will also
serve as a boutique with a small line of hand-crafted necklaces constructed by <a href=""http://www.moraycreativeadornment.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Moray Creative Adornment</u></a> (MORAY).
</p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p>To
inspire a passion for jewelry making, classes will be offered once a month on
general beading, Mala bead or meditation necklaces, hammered metal clasps and
charms, wire wrapping, freeform bezels, and other specialized techniques
depending on customer interests. Open workshops will take place in the evenings
once each week, where customers will be assisted with selecting beads and
creating jewelry in an open bead session. As a mobile enterprise, customers will
also have the ability to hire Bead Nation to travel to private events and
parties and host bead workshops. </p><div>

</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p>Help
me realize this dream and support local and indigenous communities and crafters
worldwide! Competitive advantages that Bead Nation offers range from its unique
mobility, ecologically sustainable and exotic atmosphere; to its ideal
location. Bead Nation’s rare and fairly-priced beads, workshops, and classes will
greatly benefit Portland’s Alberta Arts District community and visitors. As a
mobile store, it will add to and inspire other mobile vendors to build vibrant
and creative communities.</p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p><b>Mobile Storefront:
$28,000 </b>-
Includes Design Fee, Cost to Build, Trailer Bed, and Solar Installation. </p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p>The
structure itself was designed by and will be built by Seattle-based company
Little Mansions, that specializes in creating miniature store-front looking
studio spaces. Bead Nation will not need utilities such as water and will be
otherwise environmentally sustainable by using solar-powered, rooftop panels. Bead
Nation will have the appearance of other local stores built in the Alberta Arts
District neighborhood, but will be slightly more exotic with Moroccan-influenced
architectural details. Due to the popularity of the now-thriving Alberta
community, retail space prices as a start-up business are dauntingly high. To
get off the ground, Bead Nation needs your help in funding this unique and
sustainable storefront! </p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p><b>Administrative
Expenses: $6,000 </b>-
Includes shop furniture, register and book-keeping technology, first month’s
space rent, general liability insurance, and graphic design.</p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p>I’m
starting with little financing, which means I need all of the help I can get! Items
like counter-tops on which beads will be placed, I-pad technology and ShopKeep
book-keeping software, a typical vendor-space rent of $495, insurance, and graphic
design will make all the difference. These essential items will set Bead Nation
off on the shining path to success!</p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p><b>Opening Inventory:
$4,000+</b>
- Includes Base Supply of Beads and Supplies for Customers</p><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p>Bead
Nation needs beads. In addition to the amount I’ve worked at saving, this sum
will fund a base supply so that jewelry designers are able to pick from exotic
beads, yet also purchase their standard supplies. Both beginners and advanced
jewelry crafters will be able to create the extraordinary pieces that each of
their visions entail. The selection will include unique and rare African trade
beads that are hard to find but well-priced, and beautiful hand-selected
gemstone pendants, gemstone strands, and gemstone rosary chain not available in
other local bead stores. Bead Nation will offer a wide array of seed bead
sizes, colors, and finishes, as well as carefully-selected findings and chain
for finishing any high-quality jewelry. In addition, necessary craft items such
as pliers, wire, and cord will be available. Any money raised in addition to
the $4,000 will go toward supplementing this base supply of beads and supplies
for customers.</p><div>

</div><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Thank you for helping me to share this dream with you and others!</h3><div>
</div></div>","STORY

Each unique region in the world has a rich tradition of adornment. Thus, every bead carries a multifaceted history — from where the bead was manufactured, where it was traded, its meaning, what it was used for, and how it has since been passed along to where it is today. The connections you make while in search of these beads continue the story.  


My
name is Celia Moret-Ferguson. As a youth, my dream was to one day open a bead
store so that I could marvel at, touch, and sort beads all day; effectually transporting
me to other parts of the world and cultures. Now as an adult, after 10 years as
a traveled professional Archaeologist and Jewelry Designer, I want to share
this vision with others. My dream now... Bead Nation. After over a year of
working with a mentor at the local Small Business Administration (SCORE) to develop a business plan, and saving
every bit I can for inventory, I need your help to finally realize this dream! 


Bead
Nation will be a mobile bead store that will transport customers to cultures
afar via its unique bead selection. Store inventory will be heavily influenced
by beads manufactured and sold from around the world purchased from vendors who
support indigenous community artisans. The store’s objectives are to offer these
unique beads to jewelry designers, beginner jewelers, and anyone who
appreciates rare world goods. While its primary service is bead retail, Bead
Nation will also sell necklaces and offer classes and workshops. 


Success
of Bead Nation will be a direct result of its ability to mobilize to popular
districts and festivals, its unique inventory, as well as its pleasant and
beautiful atmosphere. The shop, designed by Little Mansions, will inspire
creativity and foster a community where artists can relate to and encourage one
another. Bead Nation will primarily be located in a designated mobile vendor
space positioned in the now popular Alberta Arts District of Portland, Oregon
and will occasionally travel to festivals. The shop will be entirely powered by
solar energy. 


Portland’s
rich mobile vendor culture has become a well-known phenomenon and is part of
what makes Portland fun, quirky, and habitable. Vendor ‘pods’ draw people and
add vibrancy to empty lots and districts. Mobile shops also afford creative
entrepreneurs the ability to establish micro-businesses while offering
customers unique options at a reasonable price. 


Having
visited hundreds of bead stores and booths, I have the experience to suitably determine
fair purchasing and retail prices. Bead Nation will carry reasonably priced and
unique beads. The mobile shop will draw in jewelers, creative makers, and the general
public. With a line of high-quality stone pendants and a variety of rosary
chain, anyone can easily craft a simple, exquisite necklace. Bead Nation will also
serve as a boutique with a small line of hand-crafted necklaces constructed by Moray Creative Adornment (MORAY).



To
inspire a passion for jewelry making, classes will be offered once a month on
general beading, Mala bead or meditation necklaces, hammered metal clasps and
charms, wire wrapping, freeform bezels, and other specialized techniques
depending on customer interests. Open workshops will take place in the evenings
once each week, where customers will be assisted with selecting beads and
creating jewelry in an open bead session. As a mobile enterprise, customers will
also have the ability to hire Bead Nation to travel to private events and
parties and host bead workshops. 











SOCIAL IMPACT


Social
impact is a foundation of the Bead Nation philosophy, which seeks to enable
indigenous cultures to continue their ancient craft of design and adornment. With
each donation, please feel empowered to support one of these ambitious non-profit
organizations that reflect Bead Nation’s ideals and inventory. By specifying in your order which of these three organization you wish to support, 5% of the donation will go directly to the non-profit of choice.





Supports tuition to attendees of the
Street Business School. This program works with impoverished women in Uganda,
and gives them the confidence and the know-how to succeed as entrepreneurs in
their local markets. The program empowers women to transform their lives.

Portland’s own Native American Youth and
Family Center whose mission is to enhance the diverse strengths of our youth
and families in partnership with the community through cultural identity and
education. Through their Marketplaces, native art, jewelry and craft items from
intertribal community vendors are sold to support the Portland Youth and
Elders’ Council to raise funds for various programs and events. Learn more here.




Promotes sustainable fair trade by
providing fair wages and employment opportunities to low-income artisans. The
program works with over 20 cooperatives and small businesses that use
traditional Maya techniques to create unique, handmade products. Your support
not only provides an income for these artisans, but also supports community
development projects in Guatemala. Learn more here.





YOUR HELP



Help
me realize this dream and support local and indigenous communities and crafters
worldwide! Competitive advantages that Bead Nation offers range from its unique
mobility, ecologically sustainable and exotic atmosphere; to its ideal
location. Bead Nation’s rare and fairly-priced beads, workshops, and classes will
greatly benefit Portland’s Alberta Arts District community and visitors. As a
mobile store, it will add to and inspire other mobile vendors to build vibrant
and creative communities.


Mobile Storefront:
$28,000 -
Includes Design Fee, Cost to Build, Trailer Bed, and Solar Installation. 


The
structure itself was designed by and will be built by Seattle-based company
Little Mansions, that specializes in creating miniature store-front looking
studio spaces. Bead Nation will not need utilities such as water and will be
otherwise environmentally sustainable by using solar-powered, rooftop panels. Bead
Nation will have the appearance of other local stores built in the Alberta Arts
District neighborhood, but will be slightly more exotic with Moroccan-influenced
architectural details. Due to the popularity of the now-thriving Alberta
community, retail space prices as a start-up business are dauntingly high. To
get off the ground, Bead Nation needs your help in funding this unique and
sustainable storefront! 


Administrative
Expenses: $6,000 -
Includes shop furniture, register and book-keeping technology, first month’s
space rent, general liability insurance, and graphic design.


I’m
starting with little financing, which means I need all of the help I can get! Items
like counter-tops on which beads will be placed, I-pad technology and ShopKeep
book-keeping software, a typical vendor-space rent of $495, insurance, and graphic
design will make all the difference. These essential items will set Bead Nation
off on the shining path to success!


Opening Inventory:
$4,000+
- Includes Base Supply of Beads and Supplies for Customers


Bead
Nation needs beads. In addition to the amount I’ve worked at saving, this sum
will fund a base supply so that jewelry designers are able to pick from exotic
beads, yet also purchase their standard supplies. Both beginners and advanced
jewelry crafters will be able to create the extraordinary pieces that each of
their visions entail. The selection will include unique and rare African trade
beads that are hard to find but well-priced, and beautiful hand-selected
gemstone pendants, gemstone strands, and gemstone rosary chain not available in
other local bead stores. Bead Nation will offer a wide array of seed bead
sizes, colors, and finishes, as well as carefully-selected findings and chain
for finishing any high-quality jewelry. In addition, necessary craft items such
as pliers, wire, and cord will be available. Any money raised in addition to
the $4,000 will go toward supplementing this base supply of beads and supplies
for customers.




PERKS!



Each
perk is handmade by our jewelry business MORAY (Moray Creative Adornment);
co-owned by Rehanah Spence and myself over the past several months/years. Each
of these pieces is thoughtfully crafted with hand-selected beads of great value.
Use these perks to select a beautiful and elegant gift for you or someone
special and help raise funds for Bead Nation as well as the local and global
community!

</h3>
<div>I am an independent filmmaker (<a href=""http://www.diyfilmmaker.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.diyfilmmaker.blogspot.com</a>), web designer/digital marketer, and a bookseller.  I've lived in Sunset Park, Brooklyn for about 5 years now and have always loved living here (specially due to the amazing view from the park). I've always been a big fan of used bookstores and have felt that the Sunset Park area would be better if it had a great used bookstore.   At present my book sales work includes selling used books wholesale to stores &amp; also selling to on-line dealers.  While doing so I've discovered sources for a virtually unlimited supply of great used books for real world/brick &amp; mortar bookstores - all subjects, all interests.  And I have over a decade of experience working in bookstores (used bookstores mostly, also Barnes &amp; Noble, Borders).  And I think used bookstores (or new bookstores for that matter) are awesome, and can be a great asset to a community.  Sunset Park, Brooklyn area could use a great bookstore with community events, special sections geared towards our diverse community, and special collections that would be of interest to people from all over NYC.  So I am launching this campaign to gauge interest in the project, meet potential collaborators, meet potential customers for the store, and to raise some of the money needed for a bookstore project.  In the days and weeks to come I'll add images and videos to this campaign to help flesh out my vision for this new, amazing Sunset Park bookstore.  Let's put on our visionary hats and think about what we can do for this project and start collaborating!</div>

</div></div>","The Short Story

I am an independent filmmaker (www.diyfilmmaker.blogspot.com), web designer/digital marketer, and a bookseller.  I've lived in Sunset Park, Brooklyn for about 5 years now and have always loved living here (specially due to the amazing view from the park). I've always been a big fan of used bookstores and have felt that the Sunset Park area would be better if it had a great used bookstore.   At present my book sales work includes selling used books wholesale to stores & also selling to on-line dealers.  While doing so I've discovered sources for a virtually unlimited supply of great used books for real world/brick & mortar bookstores - all subjects, all interests.  And I have over a decade of experience working in bookstores (used bookstores mostly, also Barnes & Noble, Borders).  And I think used bookstores (or new bookstores for that matter) are awesome, and can be a great asset to a community.  Sunset Park, Brooklyn area could use a great bookstore with community events, special sections geared towards our diverse community, and special collections that would be of interest to people from all over NYC.  So I am launching this campaign to gauge interest in the project, meet potential collaborators, meet potential customers for the store, and to raise some of the money needed for a bookstore project.  In the days and weeks to come I'll add images and videos to this campaign to help flesh out my vision for this new, amazing Sunset Park bookstore.  Let's put on our visionary hats and think about what we can do for this project and start collaborating!

That's me at the 59th St subway station in Sunset Park.  And someone's cup of coffee.

What I Need & What You Get

 I need your support - in all forms that you can offer - enthusiasm, words of support & encouragement, (when the time comes) donations of items I'll need to put the bookstore together (furniture, etc), money to cover expenses associated with running a bookstore, people to work at the bookstore, people to spread the word about the existence of the bookstore, etc.
In return I will give you books!  And hopefully a new bookstore in Sunset Park, Brooklyn in the near future.  At present I have a collection of 8,000 used books, & I can get thousands more at a short notice.  All who donate to this project will be able to choose books that they might want to get, from my collection.  I'll post up a list of available books & other details when the time comes to fulfill rewards.

One of the perks pictured below.  Hundreds of other great books & also fun & useful books will be given out as perks.

*Some of these books will be perks.
*Also all who donate will be considered Founding Members of the Bookstore Project, & will be added (if they wish) to an on-line list on the store's website, & to a Wall of Founders in the physical bookstore.  So, that would be a cool thing to tell people -  that you helped to create a bookstore in a town that did not have a bookstore.
The $24,000 being raised through this campaign and any money raised above that goal will go towards the first year's rent at the store and then towards any other essential expenses.  I'll provide updates on how the money gets used as the project progresses.  I want to build a self-sustaining store that covers all of its expenses through store sales, however, to get things started, the money raised here will go a very long way.


That's 870 books from a recent wholesale sale to a customer.  At the loading dock of one of my book storage places, in New Jersey.

    The Impact Having another real world/physical/brick & mortar bookstore in this world will be an overall positive thing in itself.
The Sunset Park, Brooklyn community will get a new space for performing art, a new meeting place, and overall an interesting new place to go to & explore new ideas & subjects & or to find some old familiar books & ideas once again.
Books, & information in general, are amazing & powerful things.  Who knows what the ultimate & long term impact of a bookstore in a community might be?  Perhaps writers & activists & business people of the future from Sunset Park will discover their passion because of a book they found in our store - entirely possible.

This sun drenched image of a pier at Sunset Park waterfront is a symbol for the positive effect that the bookstore may have on the community.

Risks & Challenges
 Creating a new bookstore is a lot of work.  However, it has been done countless times before by others & there is a lot of information available on how to do it well. So, I believe all of the following challenges can be overcome.  Here's a list of challenges or let's just call them 2 Do items: 1) raise the necessary money, 2) find a great space for the bookstore, 3) find great people to work at the store, 4) find great books (DONE), 5) find any other merchandise that the store wants to carry, 5) get the word out about the store, 6) run the store well, make it financially self-sustaining, & meet the goal of being useful to the community.  I don't think that there are any great risks.  I already have the books (or can get hundreds of thousands of books fast at a very low cost), & I believe that with my experience in the used bookstore business I will be able to successfully meet all challenges associated with this project with the help of friends & people in my community.

</div><p> </p><h3>Short Summary</h3>So I am stuck in my apartment in a scary new
 country. I just moved to Okinawa, Japan from Australia with what little
 money I could scrounge and there isn't much left.<br/><br/>So some 
friends suggested that they would be happy to support a crowd funding 
campaign to buy me a car. I am not big on begging but I am also really 
sick of being stuck in my apartment and not entirely sure how I will get
 to work on Monday. If you wanted to get me a farewell present but knew I
 was moving with limited baggage allowance then this might be for you.<br/><br/>There
 are no trains on Okinawa and the monorail is of little use to anyone 
outside of Naha (the biggest city in Okinawa). As we speak my colleagues
 are asking a random student who lives near me how to get to work until I
 can afford a car. They spent about an hour but were unable to find a 
route themselves via the internet and I have minimal Japanese reading 
ability so I was much less successful. Apparently the walk is around two
 hours in the hot, Okinawan sun. I suggested I could at least walk the 
journey home but my coordinator said it was so hot she wasn't sure it 
would be safe; I really hope it doesn't come to that. I need a car. <br/><br/>Edit:
 After much searching we found a couple busses for me to catch. It takes
 an hour even though its more like 15-20 minutes by car. But even so I 
still need a car because as it stands school is the ONLY place I can get
 to. <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Cars here are not too expensive. Compared to Australia at least, and I
 am only looking at crappy ones. I can get one for around 8-9man, maybe 
even less if I go really bodgy. A man is about AUD$110. The other 
expense is the insurance which could be up to 7man but will depend on 
the car. It will probably be less but its very hard to know. It seems 
really unfair to have to get insurance for almost the same price as the 
car itself, but I have been told it is compulsory. This fee is for two 
years though. Other than that there isn't really anything else I need. 
Of course money is tight and if by some miracle I did get more money I 
could buy a toaster. I miss toast already. I have been eating my 
Vegemite on plain bread, which in Japan is not that tasty unfortunately.
 But yeah I am not expecting to get that much money, I am just saying 
money is tight and ANYTHING I get will go to something really awesome 
and make me feel really grateful for awesome friends. (To be honest I 
mostly wanted to drop the Vegemite reference in there YAY Australia!)
</p>
<p>I am not going to lie, you don't get much out of this. Its mostly for
 me. If you visit me here in Okinawa I can probably drive you somewhere 
on the weekends when I don't have work but mostly you will probably have
 to content yourself with knowing that I am driving around being awesome
 in another country with your name written in my car. If that's your 
kinda thing then go for it!
</p> <p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Well I am not pretending this is some community service. Like I think
 I am cool and I like to think I will spread mostly good vibes once 
freed from the prison of my  transportation woes, but at the end of the 
day this is just a thing for people who want to do something nice for 
me. I have already been helped so much by strangers and friends alike, 
most of the strangers became friends and it has already been such an 
adventure. I was just really touched that my friend wanted to give me 
money for something so selfish. If anyone else is like her and wants to 
contribute, all I can say is I will remember you when I am driving my 
car and always cherish the feeling of driving a car bought with 
friendship. Also I will cherish that non cabin fever feeling. It's the 
little things you always take for granted.
</p> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Well, I have to buy a car 
either way. But I guess its risky because I don't know much about cars 
and I could buy a really crappy car. I can speak some Japanese but not 
really on the phone so if I break down that would be AWFUL. The main 
risk is just that I accidentally buy a bad car or one that needs a crazy
 amount for insurance. I do have people with native Japanese helping me 
though on this end so hopefully this wont happen.  <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Look, asking for money for 
stuff for me is pretty selfish. You don't have to contribute. But if you
 feel bad for me all alone, stuck in my apartment in such a scary place 
(actually its really nice just hard to communicate) you can always skype
 me. Especially if you are from Australia, cause I don't want to come 
back with an American accent. (I am the only Australian JET participant 
in Okinawa that I have met so far).<br/>Just keep in contact with me, sometimes I am too scared to initiate but I am almost always up for a chat if I am not busy.<br/><br/>Well thanks for reading the whole thing. I like thorough people! Good job, you will go far in life.</div>

Being in great demand, and money no object, the actress consulted leading skin doctors and apothecaries to access the best formulae that nature has to offer. The maid observed her actress mistress applying the products with amazing results, and would share this with Ma, who painstakingly wrote down in her diary the ingredients and the meticulous method of blending them together. Fast forward many years and just before her death, Ma bequeathed the diary to Roselink, the contents to be formulated and marketed to empower and support the welfare of women.The radiance and smoothness achieved instantly could only be termed 'Hello Glow' and thus the name. There is only copy of this diary, which lies safely in a vault.The magic of the diary
As per Ma's wishes, we want to use these products as a platform for disadvantaged women to become entrepreneurs. We are already supporting a victim of domestic violence, who is now in a safe situation. She can now support herself through being our appointed agent, and distributing our products to retailers. The next step is to further empower women by giving them the opportunity to run their own beauty salons providing safe and natural skincare solutions. Through this initiative we will provide them with their own salons under a lease agreement which they will manage and repay with an easy instalment scheme designed specifically for this project. The funds generated will be used to lease further sites. We will help in promoting their salons by advertising through businesses run by other female entrepreneurs. This will therefore generate further funds for their businesses too.
Be part of the magicYour contribution will facilitate the initial leasing of the premises and promote the women's businesses to consumers through advertising, branding and promotional materials. This will help ensure that their business thrives in a competitive market. With your funds, childcare will be provided to allow the women to work in a peaceful frame of mind. You will receive regular updates about how your help has changed lives of women who may otherwise have been in vulnerable and dangerous situations.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

'Get rid of the ballot boxes and pencils and save on the $100m it costs to run each federal election!' says Party Leader Francois Crespel.
With weeks to go until the election, the party is on a crowdfunding mission, without any major backing other than the people it vows to represent. 

Our party will make a difference to the Australian political system but we need your help.  At the moment we are a dedicated group of volunteers who work on building the capacity of the party using whatever spare time we have and the money from our own back pockets.  We truly are a party of the people.
To achieve our goal of giving people a say in parliament, we first need to get elected and our crowdfunding campaign intends to help achieve this by;



getting our name on the street
increasing our public profile

attracting candidates

assisting our candidates in meeting the costs associated with running as a candidate

We have estimated that it will cost at least $2,000 per candidate (House of Representatives) to run for the 2016 election.  With our current number of candidates at 10 and increasing weekly, we have set a modest target of $30,000 which will go towards Candidate AEC fees, how to vote cards and various other essential campaigning materials. 

We need as many people as possible talking about the potential of what we are doing.  We need likes on Facebook, we need people wearing our shirts, we need our stickers stuck on the back of peoples cars (please only stick them on your car :) ).  We need as many advocates, volunteers and candidates as possible registering on our website to help us bring life back to Australian democracy.
If the major political parties are funded by the interest groups that they serve, it really does make sense that Online Direct Democracy should seek its funding from the people that it serves.  Everyday Australians.  Hence, crowdfunding. 

    
If you can't contribute $$$ to the movement, that's okay, we know that times are tough and we appreciate any help you can give us.  Anyone can help by:





partaking in this crowdfunding campaign


donating to the party directly


becoming a registered member of the party


volunteering for us


becoming a candidate


'liking' and sharing our Facebook page and posts


letting everyone know about our Crowdfunding campaigns   





Above all, what Australia really needs is for people to sit up and get involved in the running of their country.  For too long we have trusted that the Government serves us in our best interests, we have been mislead.  Now it is time to put our complacency aside and get back in the game.  We can help you do that.  Get on board and we'll be standing with you at the finish line.

We also want to continue with research and pre-production for a taga10 television show to rival the dating shows airing currently and for the production of a documentary following our journey.  
Then there are the parties…. Our experienced events team have outdone themselves with their ideas for taga10 parties, all over the world. We would love to invite all of you to come to our parties and let your hair down. You may meet your 10 on the bus, but you could also meet them at one of our parties too, who knows? If you’re not there you’ll never know.                       Friends We'd Like To MeetAre you a celebrity in your country? Are you a blogger? Do you promote a club? Do you produce TV, film or radio? If you share our enthusiasm for this innovative idea and think you could help us move forward, please share our story and get in touch.  Would you like to resell our tags in your shops or clubs? We can give you great margin, so talk to us and tell us your thoughts.Have you got what it takes to produce, promote and sell taga10 under licence in your country or region? We can switch you on with production capacity in about 4 months and you could ride the adoption curve with us. We’d love to hear from you if you believe this is for you.  Would you like to talk to us about brand alignment? Do you promote a drink that would work well with our tags at live activations? Talk to us, we have lots of ideas here too.Are you an investor who is looking for the next big thing and want to discuss an equity stake? Please chat to us so that we may discuss mutually beneficial terms of business.

<p><b>Why Is Got Your Six Transport needed?</b></p>
<p>Imagine being offered
a good job but you have no transportation. This is the exact problem many of
our homeless veterans face when living in veterans shelters. A meaningful job
would be invaluable in helping our homeless vets, both emotionally and
financially, as they strive to transition. Got Your Six Transport will provide
the transportation to make this possibility a reality, and to help vets get
back to work.</p>
<p>Advocates of
homeless veterans agree that this is the exact type of program that is needed.
Alternative traditional transportation is much too costly, and it cannot
provide the consistency and reliability that the veterans and the prospective
employers need. Vets who want to work can’t.</p>
<p>This campaign
will support the establishment of the <b>Got
Your Six Transport</b> organization as a non-profit organization, and get us
started in our mission to help our vets get back to work. </p>
<p><b>What your support will mean to us:</b></p>
<p>A thorough and
comprehensive business plan has already been completed and now we need your
help.</p>
<p>All heartfelt
non-profit services must have a beginning. You are in at the exciting start.
Your donations will allow us to:</p>

<p><b>What your support will mean to vets:</b></p>
<p>The veterans and
their families that are now homeless have sacrificed so much for us and our
country. Now they need our support. They don’t want a handout – they want to be
able to get to work so they can rebuild their lives. Helping <b>Got Your Six Transport</b> means that you
will be helping vets re-enter the workforce. Vets have always had our backs – now

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Aloha, my name is Micah Alo. I am 19 years old and the founder of Alo[ha] Creations. Before starting my business, I graduated from Kamehameha Schools Maui Campus and continued my education at Dominican University of California . Due to financial difficulties, I was only able to attend school for one semester. After my time at Dominican, I chose to pursue one of my greatest passions, soccer. I did tryouts with the Portland Timbers u23 squad and was able to train with the team. I played in the team's stadium as well as training centers, it was an amazing experience that I will never forget. Shortly after my time with the Timbers, I returned home and pursued another one of my life-long goals, which was starting a business.</p>
<p>Alo[ha] Creations is a Christian family-run business. We were meant to give. We support local youth teams with our product for fundraising events. There are also two ways we share a portion of our profits; one locally and the other internationally. Locally we support Made In Hope which is a non-profit organization. <a href=""http://www.madeinhope.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MADE IN HOPE</a> empowers women and children who have been rescued from the global sex trade (sex trafficking) to break the cycle of exploitation and secure their freedom by providing education, sustainable livelihood opportunities, and care in the healing process. Internationally we give to a small village in Uganda called Bujjuuko Mbazi. Along with the help of Father Leonard Ssempijja, we are able to give the youth and people of Bujjuuko Mbazi the hope and help they need . </p>
<p>Aside from helping us take our facility to the required next step. The social impact Alo[ha] Creations will have on the lives of these people and children will be morally and spiritually life changing. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are in need of $40,000. The septic tank will cost around $8,000-$10,000. The specific tank we need will cost $2400. We have gotten quotes from two contractors who are willing to take on the project of installing the tank. Both quotes are in the ball park of $6,000-$7,000. The oven we are looking at is a double decker oven that will hold 20 racks of cookies. Currently our oven has 3 racks with a make-shift rack, and is only able to make five dozen cookies an hour. With this new oven we will be able to increase our production to 25 dozen cookies and hour. With great benefit comes great cost. This oven will cost $12,000. To complete the kitchen with all the necessary supplies and appliances we are looking at another $15,000-$20,000. These appliances will include: G-series Reach in Refrigerator, Fabricated Economy 3-compartment Stainless Steel Sink, Equipment Stainless Steel Stands, Stainless Steel Shelving, Stainless Steel professional mixer, and lastly a hand-washing sink. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>For me risk is something I view as a challenge rather than something that can discourage me. If there was no risk then there would be no sense of fulfillment or meaning. Everyday is a challenge and there is a risk in everything we do. Even something as simple as walking across the street. I realize that each of you are taking a risk in investing in my campaign. Rest assured it will not be in vain. Together we have the opportunity to face head on some of the big challenges that this world faces today. Namely, human/sex trafficking, and poverty. Thank you for taking the time to read my campaign, together we can make a real difference. Change is one click away. Thank you and God bless.</p>

</div></div>","Summary Hello, my name is John Zanettos and I'm the owner and operator of The Man Cave Cinema. 
I am here to ask for funding for my small business that has the potential to grow. Currently I am working on several items for my business.


My Blog themancavecinmea.com informing the public about cord cutting and the technology behind it.

Online Store that sells Antenna and Over the Air DVR's to help people get free TV and cancel their expensive cable bill.
Installing Antennas and DVR's for people in Toronto Canada and the greater Toronto area.
Hosting an ongoing Youtube series that talks about cord cutting and home theater. Very educational and entertaining. 
   What I Need & What You Get 
We are looking for $2000.00 to help the company grow. The funds will go to improve our presence on the internet and locally. 
During these tough financial times people are looking to cut costs and we can help them by selling and installing an antenna to get free TV and cancel cable. Our goal is to help! If we do not meet our goal we can always use what ever money we receive to continue our work. We will never give up on this venture. It is too important not to pursue it. People need to know that there is another option to pay TV.    The Impact The difference that your funding will make...  Offering people an alternative to expensive cable by selling inexpensive but excellent quality antennas. Saving them thousands of dollar each year.
Giving us the means to have happy and satisfied customers, who never have to worry about another cable bill again. We have had some successful installations, here are a few pictures of my work.










Also selling directly to our customers from our online store.



    Risks & Challenges  The major challenge for me is getting the word out to the public on how cord cutting will save you money, from high cable bills and that getting free TV from over the air is easy and worry free. Also people can catch 20-40 channels depending on the area they live.  The funding will go to advertising on social media and locally in the yellow pages. Again the Challenge is getting people to know The Man Cave Cinema. Once they become familiar with us, we offer free in home demos or videos on youtube on how easy cord cutting can be. Once customers see with their own eye whats available they become believers. (Best part of the Job)    Other Ways You Can Help Please help us get the word out to everyone! Please share this campaign on social media and word of mouth.

</p><p><i>We’ve
revoliutionized the existing advertising system to make ads really helpful! We
are building APM Chat to help local business to promote goods and services
fairly and provide customers with the unique chance to cooperate with local
businesses and understand that advertising is an essential tool to boost their
local economy. </i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>The result
– a truly high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty!</i></p><p>I’ve been running my own small businesses successfully for quite
a long time: I sell things that people need for their home. I love what I do
because I feel I do a meaningful job. Yet I’ve faced every pitfall local
entrepreneurs have to overcome to spread the word about their business. </p>
<p>Following marketing gurus’ advice, I was printing countless
flyers and paid solicitors to stuff letterboxes of my potential clients with
them. I was paying more and more money every day for social network advertising
and invading people’s private space. No wonder the more ads I sent, the more
ignorant my clients were. So I was struggling to find the answer why people get
irritated by other people telling them about handy, interesting and even
ingenious things. The answer came out of a sudden: people don’t mind ads – what
they don’t like is the way they are delivered.</p>
<p>It was hight time I had to find a different way to address my
customers. I understood I need to talk to them directly, without
intermediaries, so that people see that I respect them and they can trust me.
The result is <a href=""http://www.adpays.me"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.adpays.me</a> - an IT
startup, the fruit of my and my team labor. The website has been translated
into 10 languages and has been successfully launched, so it is available for
businesses around the world. </p>
<p>Yet a dynamic business world dictates the necessity for a mobile
version. That’s why we really need your support to create APM Chat. When it has
been created, it will transform the existing advertising system: customers will
love ads while ads will be friendly and respectful to their viewers. </p><p>We will
express our gratitude by offering our backers some really nice perks.  </p>

                                         Ukrainian version      Lithuanian version

We’ve
revoliutionized the existing advertising system to make ads really helpful! We
are building APM Chat to help local business to promote goods and services
fairly and provide customers with the unique chance to cooperate with local
businesses and understand that advertising is an essential tool to boost their
local economy. 

The result
– a truly high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty!I’ve been running my own small businesses successfully for quite
a long time: I sell things that people need for their home. I love what I do
because I feel I do a meaningful job. Yet I’ve faced every pitfall local
entrepreneurs have to overcome to spread the word about their business. 
Following marketing gurus’ advice, I was printing countless
flyers and paid solicitors to stuff letterboxes of my potential clients with
them. I was paying more and more money every day for social network advertising
and invading people’s private space. No wonder the more ads I sent, the more
ignorant my clients were. So I was struggling to find the answer why people get
irritated by other people telling them about handy, interesting and even
ingenious things. The answer came out of a sudden: people don’t mind ads – what
they don’t like is the way they are delivered.
It was hight time I had to find a different way to address my
customers. I understood I need to talk to them directly, without
intermediaries, so that people see that I respect them and they can trust me.
The result is www.adpays.me - an IT
startup, the fruit of my and my team labor. The website has been translated
into 10 languages and has been successfully launched, so it is available for
businesses around the world. 
Yet a dynamic business world dictates the necessity for a mobile
version. That’s why we really need your support to create APM Chat. When it has
been created, it will transform the existing advertising system: customers will
love ads while ads will be friendly and respectful to their viewers. We will
express our gratitude by offering our backers some really nice perks.  









- We are building this instrument to help local businesses to promote goods and services fairly 
- We want to support a high level of customers’ loyalty
- We work so that customers would understand that advertising is an important tool to boost their local economy
-  We believe that customers can easily cooperate with local business via advertising without being distracted and irritated by ads
- We’ve altered the current advertising model to make ads really helpful and friendly to people.






         How will APM Chat change advertising?














No more unsolicited advertising! Your time and attention spent
on own advertising board – APM Board – is always financially rewarding, because
you get 90% of the cost of one ad display. 










You select the categories of ads you are interested in, and you get the promotions available in close proximity first.









You see ads only when you want to!










Neither advertisers nor APM Agentuur (us) traces your activity
in the system. In other words, you are completely anonymous to advertisers –
they see only the information you provide them.














 Manipulation and influencing your choice aren't possible. 











Nothing annoys you and distracts from communicating with your
friends. You won’t receive any pop-ups, instead, you’ll see a polite
notification about how much advertising on your own ad board wants to pay you
for your time and attention. You decide when you want to see it.









Your email boxes will miraculously become spam-free. 















You become responsible for market economic sustainability in the
country you live. Since you are paid 90% of the cost of the ads you see, you
support local business – the backbone of your local economy.












The money you are paid can be used to pay for online services,
subscriptions, music, movies, bills and other stuff. You can also withdraw the
money to your bank account. If you wish, you can start your own advertising
campaign on www.adpays.me. In a nutshell, you do
with your money whatever you want!

















The best price for advertising: only 0,01-0,09 EURO for one
guaranteed display. 







A high Click through rate of 65-75%.










You have easy and full control of the advertising campaigns you are running.










You can terminate your
campaign at any time and withdraw the unspent money directly to your accounts. 







You can allocate funds as you wish. 









You choose yourself how many users and times your ad will be displayed so that you users remember it. The system prevent fake views, be sure your message will be gotten.










You needn’t spend your marketing money on social networks and
search engines. All the money stays in your region. It supports the locals and
increase their purchasing power. Users are happy with your ads!










You can be sure that some money will be returned by the users
who got interested in products and services you offer. Remember, you pay them
for their time and attention. This courtesy towards them makes your potential
customers want to see what you have to offer. 









What’s wrong with the advertising market and how APM Chat solves
it









Unlike “attention traps”, we give you 90% of the cost
of the ad you see on your APM Board. You rent your time only when you want to:
no single ad will intrude and steal your attention. 







1.  We control
and block fake accounts created by one user.
2.  We are
serviced by online payment system Paysera, which asks for an official document
everyone who creates an account for financial operations there. Our partner
guarantess that advertisers’ money is paid only to real people.







We don’t monitor users’ location,
instead, users set it themselves. The location can be easily changed: for
example, if you plan a trip and want to see what local businesses have to offer
you. Yet, even though we do not see users’ IP, if a user changes his or her
location too frequently, we consider it as dishonesty and take measures.








Advertisers themselves decide how
many times and how many users will see their ad, so you know the cost of the campaign
in advance and you won’t spend a cent more. Besides, the cost of ad is so low
that users will hardly make it their source of income. 










Chat
without ads






APM Chat is a mobile application
based on an online advertising platform www.adpays.me
There are no unwanted ads, only polite notifications informing you about how
much advertisers want to pay you for viewing their ads. 





Contacts

WE BELIEVE YOUR TIME IS VALUABLE
APM Chat will provide users with everything they need for
convenient and positive communication. Your contacts from iOS or Android
devices will be easily transferred to APM Chat, if the function is on. The
contacts you already have in the contact list in your desktop version will be imported
as well.


ADS PAY EVERYONE
No friend you want to chat with? Invite your pals using APM Chat!
As soon as your friends have joined us, we’ll give them their unique APM Board
accessible from both desktop and mobile versions. From this very moment they
receive all special offers and get paid for it!
GOOD ADVERTISING = GOOD USABILITY
APM Sync Feature will automatically save any data to any device
you use. You will never lose your personal data and will have access to it from
your devices – what you will need to do is just to log in.
Stickers



APM Chat offers several sets of
unique stickers to make your chatting even more expressive! Our partners, www.stickerium.com, kindly designed the
set “Fun and Love Production” especially for the users of APM Chat so that they
could use them for free. Want more? You can find sets for every taste and buy
the ones you liked on our partners’ website.  
















Download the app










A. For registered users: log in with your APM Board user name and password.
B. For newcomers: Create a new profile and get a new APM Board. From this very moment you'll receive targeted local ads. We advise you pick your Personal Interests in the ABOUT ME section so that you only see offers you are truly interested in.

The effective, fully-functioning web-version (www.adpays.me) built


Translated into 10 languages


A dedicated team works for you

Where does the money advertiser pay go?

90% of the money an advertiser pays for a display, goes directly to an APM Board owner's account.

We are a travel photography and blogging duo, and we are starting a project called PermacultureD.This project is focused on documenting permaculture as a sustainable way of feeding the community. We want to learn about this style of agriculture and share it with the world by self-publishing a photobook based around permaculture.</p><p>  Blake, 27, has been capturing moments through his lense for the past six years, and selling prints for the last two. He currently has prints displayed and for sale in Salida, Colorado. He also has recently co-founded a travel blog with Mindy. You can see his photography here: (<a href=""http://blakeruizphotography.communityofculture.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://blakeruizphotography.communityofculture.com/</a>).</p><p>Mindy, 23, has lived in Colorado her whole life, and has a strong passion for mother nature and the community. Normally armed with a camera and a notepad, she is finally spreading her wings to be the change she wishes to see. She started by writing and co-founding a blog with Blake about her travels across the Pacific Northwest, Canada, Montana, and Yellowstone National Park. You can see their blog at <a href=""http://yesplzkthnx.communityofculture.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YESPLZKTHNX.COM</a>.</p><p>We are teaming up with Bona Fide for eight weeks starting December 10th. Bona Fide is a 26 acre permaculture farm, located on Isla Ometepe (Island of Twin Volcanoes), which is located in Nicaragua. With a focus on agro-ecology, experienced based learning, and food sovereignty, it is a model for the possibilities of self-sustainable systems. Their vision is to provide people with the necessary knowledge and skills to empower them to produce their own food in a more sustainable manner, and live more intentionally in their own environments. You can check them out at <a href=""http://projectbonafide.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">projectbonafide.com</a>.</p><h3>The Why and The What</h3><p>We have accepted that there is a disconnect within our society and nature, with each other and resources needed to survive and thrive. We are looking to find a better way of living in relation to our planet, the food it produces, and one another. We accept that the earth will not be healed tomorrow, that agriculture, nutrition, and societal issues will not be changed the day after, but we are here to be a part of the change we wish to see in the world. </p><p>On December 10th, our learning experience will begin. For 8 weeks we are going to get our hands dirty, put our brains to work, and learn and share our experience with the world. We will learn about living sustainably, permaculture systems, farm life, growing our own food, and feeding the community. We are going to share the whole experience on our blog <a href=""http://yesplzkthnx.communityofculture.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YESPLZKTHNX</a>. Upon returning we are going to write and self-publish a photo book about the trip. The purpose of the book is to spread awareness of permaculture by telling an intimate story through the eyes of a firsthand experience. </p><p>Picture this...your friend sits down on your super comfy couch and out of the corner of their eye, a book catches their attention. BUT, not just any book. A beautifully bonded book, casted with one simple word, 'PermacultureD'. Upon opening this book, a story is told one page at a time. With lay-flat pages providing a seamless experience of panoramas of our adventure and the experience of a hands-on learning environment. Your friend will be swept into a world that they might not know anything about. This is where you come in! You followed the entire journey on the blog and learned the basics of permaculture and how it can be applied, so you share your tid-bit of knowledge. Then, you send them to <a href=""http://yesplzkthnx.communityofculture.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YESPLZKTHX.com</a> and<a href=""http://projectbonafide.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">projectbonafide.com</a>, and the cycle is complete. In a world where electronic devices rule the power, printed media could make a major difference in the ability to catch people's attention long enough to teach them something that could have a great impact on the world. </p><br/><h3>What We Need</h3><p>The time we spend volunteering, learning, and sharing is very valuable but the trip will not be free. There are travel expenses, living expenses, printing costs, and a donation for Bona Fide to come up with. We need your support to make this happen. We have already purchased our plane ticket and set up our stay with Bona Fide, but we are not fully prepared to take on the rest of the expenses. Expenses like our travel home, donation for Bona Fide, and printing costs for the book are still unaccounted for, but with your help, we will easily get there. Here's a little break-down to give you an idea of what our expenses look like.</p><p>----------------------------</p><p>Travel Expenses- $1,640<br/>Living Expenses- $2,860<br/>Crowdfunding Expenses- $4,133<br/>---------------------------------------<br/>Subtotal - $8,633 <br/>Donation - $1,000<br/>IndieGoGo (approx. 10%) - $963<br/>---------------------------------------<br/>TOTAL - $10,596</p><p>-Our travel expenses include plane tickets, other transportation, hostels, and food.<br/>-Living expenses include our room and board and well as food for 8 weeks.<br/>-Crowdfunding expenses include the perks YOU will receive upon making a donation. You can look to the right to see what these goodies are.<br/>-A donation to Bona Fide will be given to go towards any future or current projects that need little extra umph to make happen. <br/>-Annnddd, finally, in case ya didn't know, IndieGoGo isn't free to use. They have employees to pay and babies to feed. They take 5% and card processing is another 3-5%.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Don't have money to help us out? That's totally bueno, here are some other ways you can help. Share us on your Facebook, tell your friends, tell your neighbors, tell your grandma. You can not expect change in the world if you don't have a little conversation. Encourage others to do the same! We appreciate all the help because we can’t do it without you!

The purpose of the book is to spread awareness of permaculture by telling an intimate story through the eyes of a firsthand experience. Picture this...your friend sits down on your super comfy couch and out of the corner of their eye, a book catches their attention. BUT, not just any book. A beautifully bonded book, casted with one simple word, 'PermacultureD'. Upon opening this book, a story is told one page at a time. With lay-flat pages providing a seamless experience of panoramas of our adventure and the experience of a hands-on learning environment. Your friend will be swept into a world that they might not know anything about. This is where you come in! You followed the entire journey on the blog and learned the basics of permaculture and how it can be applied, so you share your tid-bit of knowledge. Then, you send them to YESPLZKTHX.com andprojectbonafide.com, and the cycle is complete. In a world where electronic devices rule the power, printed media could make a major difference in the ability to catch people's attention long enough to teach them something that could have a great impact on the world. What We NeedThe time we spend volunteering, learning, and sharing is very valuable but the trip will not be free. There are travel expenses, living expenses, printing costs, and a donation for Bona Fide to come up with. We need your support to make this happen. We have already purchased our plane ticket and set up our stay with Bona Fide, but we are not fully prepared to take on the rest of the expenses. Expenses like our travel home, donation for Bona Fide, and printing costs for the book are still unaccounted for, but with your help, we will easily get there. Here's a little break-down to give you an idea of what our expenses look like.----------------------------Travel Expenses- $1,640Living Expenses- $2,860Crowdfunding Expenses- $4,133---------------------------------------Subtotal - $8,633 Donation - $1,000IndieGoGo (approx. 10%) - $963---------------------------------------TOTAL - $10,596-Our travel expenses include plane tickets, other transportation, hostels, and food.-Living expenses include our room and board and well as food for 8 weeks.-Crowdfunding expenses include the perks YOU will receive upon making a donation. You can look to the right to see what these goodies are.-A donation to Bona Fide will be given to go towards any future or current projects that need little extra umph to make happen. -Annnddd, finally, in case ya didn't know, IndieGoGo isn't free to use. They have employees to pay and babies to feed. They take 5% and card processing is another 3-5%.Other Ways You Can HelpDon't have money to help us out? That's totally bueno, here are some other ways you can help. Share us on your Facebook, tell your friends, tell your neighbors, tell your grandma. You can not expect change in the world if you don't have a little conversation. Encourage others to do the same! We appreciate all the help because we can’t do it without you!

goal of providing accurate, flexible models for students of all ages in the

understanding of 'how nature works' .

EASY ASSEMBLY NO TOOLS. TRY THAT IN SPACE!
INCA STEM kits are designed to model nature from the atomic and molecular scale with flexible motions showing the patterns and relationships of energy movement before it becomes matter.

DNA LIKE CODE creating Self Assembling structures and NANO machines



NEXT GENERATION STEM INCA (inter nodal connector architecture) kits will ""Stimulate a child's creative inquiry, and unlock
the questions about a subject, leading the child to look for answers that can
solve problems, while also discovering new possibilities and paths to
explore.  This allows the child to ask 'WHY and WHY NOT' as they progress,
which starts their creative inquiry.  We need to be able to answer their
questions about NATURE, how it is all connected, how the energy at the nano-scale becomes mass that forms matter, with models that look like atoms, and
can model all elements of the periodic table as the get older.  Nature is
not square or rigid, therefore, these accurate flexible models will allow
students to see the patterns and relationships in nature with accuracy.



The STEM directorate wants students to pick a world problem and find a solution that involves science, technology, engineering, and math, without any specific content or facts.  It is no wonder teachers are confused.  Solving this dichotomy has required several re-writes of the first 'Nano in Nature k-5' series of interactive textbooks. 

 The author: Judith Light Feather, President of The Nano Technology Group is launching the latest edition of the series: 'The Magic of the Nano World' as a Perk with a PDF file download link.  
The newest version has added suggestions for Art projects to stimulate students creativity and deeper understanding of the interactive resources provided. The k-5 grades are the most creative years for learning and the art helps them express their creativity and how they relate to the world.

 These tools will lead the way for a New Generation, to not only Create a New Future, but in doing so, engineer entire NEW industries. 

 It will help teachers to challenge students to keep asking questions and to find the answers from the 'bottom up' instead of waiting for directions from the 'top down'.  This combination of resources is designed to 'respect our teachers' and help them to present creative content and introduce STEM as the study of Nature.  What We Need & What You Get

  Funding needs for manufacturing the STEM kits:$30,000 - 4- cavity Injection Mold Tooled for production. Design Shown here.


$80,000 - to manufacture 3000 retail STEM Science Education Model Kits.

Each kit will contain 60 nodes, in colors which replicate atoms, and 100 color connecting struts,  along with graphic directions for students.
 Step 1, The donations you give will be used to fund the molding, casting, production, Marketing, packaging and shipping of the product. The first $30,000 will fund the Injection mold in preparation for manufacturing the kits.  

Step 2, will be the design of the boxes and graphics for students, as we get ready for production.

Step 3, manufacturing stage, we will actively work with our factory to make sure
that everything is up to our standards.
 in addition a link will be provided to download PDF file of the latest 'Nano in Nature k-5' series of Interactive textbooks. possibly a CD or DVD in each kit.  
Parents and teachers can pre-order their kits for $40.00 donations which includes USA shipping. 
Schools can order multiple kits of 10 or more with a 35% discount.  
Any donations are also welcome for anyone who would like to help with this education project.
Any amount over the goal will be used for increasing the Marketing and manufacturing of the kits.  We will keep working towards larger production runs, to keep up with the orders.  



The Impact-  The ability for students, teachers, parents and/or schools to buy a STEM kit that actually mimics nature at the atomic level where energy forms matter - will stimulate the creativity in young students to develop an interest for deeper understanding of nature as they mature.  Science in all fields is the study of nature, leading to new technologies, and engineering structures for our future.  

Remember: Other Modeling Kits are Square and Rigid plastic, which do not mimic nature.  INCA STEM kits are designed to model nature from the atomic and molecular scale with flexible motions showing the patterns and relationships of energy movement before it becomes matter.

</div></div>","Our dream is to build apartment hotels with a social cause worldwide - all based on the same concept: offering an exceptional stay and earning a healthy profit to invest in childrens future.Social Hotels will offer great value, superb service and warm hospitality. We'll not be the first crowdsourced hotel, but our strategy is absolutely unique, with a focus on the triple bottom line, society, the environment, as well as financials:



Support
	of children's future: Every cent of our hotels net profit
	goes directly to charity projects for children worldwide. Every
	child has the right to be happy, healthy, protected and loved



Locally-Sourced
	Merchandise: We want to sell branded products in our hotel from
	the reception shop, however, strictly those that are produced and
	handmade by the locals; to create jobs and promote the community.


Staff
	Support: Our hotel will provide employment and social returns for the local community. 
Croatia
is a popular tourist destination and tourism ist fast growing. We
want to use this touristic potential to generate healthy cashflows in
order to invest in children charity organisation.  




Anyone
who had the opportunity to explore Croatia will sure tell you that it
is a traveller's paradise. With its many isles this is an
alluring place to be in. Stunning coast, breath-taking scenery,
fabulous architecture and of course - the amazing food and
wine! Being a traveler in Croatia does not mean you will not
feel like home. Quite opposite. Once you enter this exquisite
country, it will feel like a home-away-from-home. You will
become addicted to Croatia. And yes. You will fall in love with
this place. Do not say we didn't warn you. 

Read here more about
Croatia.





We
were looking at many different locations adequate for a 20 rooms aparthotel, wrote a 30 page business plan to ensure we had our strategy
and numbers just right, and prepared for all of the difficult and
complicated Croatian laws. And, we are almost ready to start, but,
there are still a few obstacles to overcome:



Finance: Our aparthotel will consist of approx. 20 rooms  in a relaxed and
	intimate setting. The total investment in land,
	buildings and other assets would be around $ 1'350,000. This
	sum will be sourced through crowdfunding, donations, private loans
	and investments.

Through
crowdfunding we want to raise at least 50% of the total investment
amount needed. We start here on Indiegogo with
amount of $
80'000 needed
for land and property purchase. If we collect more money
from the initial goal we'll use it for remodelling of the facilities
in order to create
comfortable and spacious rooms. To cut costs, one part of
renovations work and repairs will be done with our own labour as well
as friends. However, things like buying the furniture, the
mattresses, and new linens, require some seed capital.




Location: -
There are 2 possible locations - Dalmatia and Istria



Dalmatia-
	Our first target is to make this hotel in Dalmatia. Everybody say
	that nowhere in Croatia can boast beaches like those of Dalmatia.
	The region has the perfect combination of that distincitve Croatien
	light, unspoiled landscapes, colours and fragrances. And the
	glorious natural setting is complemented by the rich culinary fare
	of the region and the living religious traditions of its people,
	manifested in a host of feast days and other ceremonies and
	rituals. 


Istria - Our
	second target is to make this hotel by the beautiful beaches placed
	at the foot of Mountain Učka. It's a unique place combining from
	one hand climbing, mountain walks, biking and from the other hand
	sea sports, swimming and many relaxing sea bars or even vivid
	nightlife!f   




Hotel
	name: A
	list of 5 names will be announced as soon as we have purchased a
	property.  You're be able to vote the name of our hotel through
	our website www.socialhotels.org. 








Supporters
who become part of this project will be rewarded with awesome gifts
and travel vouchers over the invested sum to be used for a stay at
our Social Hotel in Croatia. You can use it for yourself or surprise
your loved ones with this unusual gifts. See perks for more details:















Please
find detailed information about travel voucher's terms and
conditions here.


We
are helping children suffering from poverty, exploitation or violence
worldwide. Along with our local project partners we seek
solutions when children live in the street, work under inhuman
conditions or have to prostitute themselves, and when a war has
destroyed their health or their homes. We support women, families and
communities in caring for their children and we help young people to
build a future beyond violence and poverty.



We
are a modern, networked organization of qualified experts and social
entrepreneurs. Our team is made up of 6 loyal and experienced
professionals who dedicate their spare time to Social Hotel. When we
had opened our first hotel, we intend to hire more employees to
manage, monitor and advise on a continuous  basis.



This
past season, we also ran a successful small business renting
apartments and homes within our network through our various online
sales travel platforms. We surprise ourselves with our own success,
because this last summer was extremely busy, the guests required a
lot from us, and at the end of it we left with a new appreciation of
what we loved to do, and what we can do even better for next year!

What started as me sharing my favorite chemical and cruelty-free products at the yoga studio has morphed into a full-scale business venture ran by a few trusted colleagues that help on small projects and me.</p>
<p>I manifested the idea shortly after I began teaching yoga. Spending more time than ever at the yoga studio, I found myself constantly sharing the products I used and loved. The interactions I had with my students and peers acted as the catalyst for BuddhiBox. </p>
<p>Once I formulated the idea, it did not take long for me to act. I stepped down from my role as Senior Supply Chain Manager at Red Envelope Gifts and I enrolled in San Diego’s Start Up Leadership program. BuddhiBox was founded in September 2014 on the core tenets of discovery, union and compassion.</p>
<p>I am launching this campaign to ensure our boxes can continue to ship through this period of expansion. The first BuddhiBoxes shipped in November of 2014. The growth and engagement we’ve experienced last year has required changes to the website, changes to our distribution model and a larger volume of units required from vendors. </p>
<p>BuddhiBox has grown to a size I can no longer manage on my own and I am seeking this funding the facilitate our growth. As an inventory business, I pay deposits to my partner vendors upfront. Ninety-five percent of my partners are small business, it is essential they receive funds to cover the overhead costs. Further, our growth has we required the need for our website capacity to expand. Recently, high traffic caused the website to crash. While I am grateful I have this problem to solve, user experience is suffering as we seek funding to evolve. </p>
<p>For me, the success of BuddhiBox spans far behind the service itself. Every time a box ships, we help a small business owner earn revenue and gain exposure and proceeds from the box are donated to a nonprofit or charity:</p>

<p><b>WHO WE ARE:</b></p>
<p>Megan Gibson founded PB&amp;Jams in 2013, after a taste of
savory Haitian peanut butter inspired her to start crafting some delicious
combinations using nut butter and innovative additions – from sweet maple syrup
to spicy cayenne pepper. Soon, her handcrafted, small-batch nut butters could
be found in some of Philadelphia’s premier independent markets and at community
events. </p>
<p>As the nut butters increased in popularity, Megan’s
long-term dream of making fun, delicious food for the community grew, and she
developed a plan to establish a food truck using her nut butters in unexpected (and
unforgettable!) ways. A custom food truck, unlike any other on the road, was
built by hand and hit local events in 2014. </p>
<p>PB&amp;Jams currently operates out of our headquarters –
Megan’s home – and a community commercial kitchen in West Philadelphia. The nut
butters are still handcrafted in small batches by Megan and her dedicated,
creative and wonderful part-time staffer, Mal.</p>
<p>PB&amp;Jams is grateful for our success – defined first and
foremost by the remarkable and lasting relationships it has with so many
members of the community.</p>

<p>·<span> 
</span>Streamlining the production process for our
small-batch, unique nut butters by repairing old equipment and securing some

without compromising attention to detail! By upgrading our equipment, we can make your food experience even better and meet increased demand.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Covering the costs of a massive repair to our

<p>Siamo un <b>gruppo Scout di 26 ragazzi e ragazze tra i 16 e i 21 anni di Castel Goffredo</b>, in provincia di Mantova.</p><p></p><h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">COSA VOGLIAMO</span><br/>
</h3><p></p><p>Vogliamo realizzare il nostro progetto di andare a Zumbahua, piccolo paesino sulle Ande dell’Ecuador, per <b>supportare la comunità locale nella costruzione di alcune case</b>.</p><h3>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/9kDZfJY.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>Il progetto nasce da mesi di discussioni all’interno del nostro Clan: cosa possiamo fare per <b>riuscire allo stesso tempo a metterci in gioco personalmente e capire più a fondo ciò che succede</b> intorno a noi? Come possiamo imparare, lungo il cammino, a <b>trasformare in realtà anche i sogni più audaci </b>e impensabili? Come possiamo <b>agire impegnando innanzitutto noi stessi fino ad avere un impatto nelle cose lontane</b>?</p><p>Cercavamo un sogno in grado di contenere tutto questo, e quindi abbiamo scelto un obiettivo che fosse grande e difficile da realizzare.</p><p>Trasformare questo sogno in realtà<b> ha significato imparare a progettare e iniziare un cammino di preparazione un anno prima della nostra partenza</b>. Ha significato anche affrontare tante difficoltà, impegnarsi a fondo per riuscire a rendere questo sogno un progetto concreto.</p><p>L’obiettivo è diventato quindi <b>effettuare un’esperienza di servizio dall’altra parte del mondo, in Ecuador</b>, accompagnando tutto il percorso con un approfondimento teorico sul diritto all’umanità.</p><p>L’Ecuador è considerato un paese in via di sviluppo, dove la <b>povertà diffusa raggiunge apici impensabili nelle comunità montane</b>. Proprio in una di queste comunità si concentrerà il nostro operato.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">COSA ABBIAMO GIÀ FATTO</span><br/></p><p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/whl2CwV.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>Questo viaggio non nasce oggi, ma molti mesi fa. Crediamo che l’unico modo per realizzare un obiettivo sia quello di impegnarsi in prima persona. Per questo motivo <b>negli ultimi 10 mesi siamo stati impegnati in diverse modalità di raccolta fondi</b>:</p><ul>
<li><p>attività di <b>autofinanziamento </b>(bancarelle di oggetti realizzati da noi, servizi a degli eventi, baby sitting, feste di compleanno, ecc..)</p></li>
<li><p><b>risparmio personale di 50€ mensili</b> (essendo quasi tutti studenti tale somma non poteva che essere ricavata da alcune rinunce nella propria vita) in modo da dare ancora maggior valore al servizio che faremo</p></li>
<li><p>donazioni individuali e <b>raccolta fondi</b> sul territorio</p></li>
<li><p>campagna di <b>crowdfunding </b>sul web</p></li>
</ul><p>Il risparmio personale e le attività di autofinanziamento hanno lo scopo di renderci i primi attori del progetto. <b>Il nostro impegno è fondamentale per chiedere alle altre persone di credere nel progetto e sostenerci</b>.</p><h3>IL PROGETTO</h3><p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Zumbahua_centro.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>Il progetto prende forma dopo l’incontro con <b>Don Claudio, missionario dell’operazione Mato Grosso</b>, il quale ci propone di aiutarli nella realizzazione di alcune case nel paesino di Zumbahua (Ecuador).</p><p><b>Uno dei problemi maggiori a Zumbahua è la mancanza di case dignitose e resistenti</b>. Quasi tutti vivono in capanne di mattoni di fango e paglia e lamiera, che vengono spesso distrutte e divelte dalla pioggia e dal forte vento estivo.</p><p>Il lavoro che possiamo svolgere è proprio<b> la costruzione di due case più resistenti</b>: le strade dissestate e i mancati collegamenti rendono questo lavoro molto lungo (i muratori locali sono solo due) e uno dei problemi principali è il trasporto dei materiali da cantiere.</p><p>Con la mano d’opera, giovane ed entusiasta, di 26 ragazzi sarebbe infatti possibile costruire due case durante la nostra permanenza (20 giorni); <b>il numero elevato permette infatti il veloce trasporto dei materiali (principalmente a piedi) e un aiuto sostanziale nelle più facili operazioni edilizie</b>.</p><p>Dunque il cuore del progetto sarà la realizzazione delle abitazioni, ma durante la nostra permanenza saremo<b> impegnati anche in altre attività formative</b>:</p><ul>
<li><p>Un gemellaggio con un gruppo scout di Quito</p></li>
<li><p>Attività ricreative con i bambini di Zumbahua</p></li>
<li><p>Piccole escursioni sulle Ande</p></li>

</div></div>","CHI SIAMO

Siamo un gruppo Scout di 26 ragazzi e ragazze tra i 16 e i 21 anni di Castel Goffredo, in provincia di Mantova.
COSA VOGLIAMO
Vogliamo realizzare il nostro progetto di andare a Zumbahua, piccolo paesino sulle Ande dell’Ecuador, per supportare la comunità locale nella costruzione di alcune case.
PERCHÈ


Il progetto nasce da mesi di discussioni all’interno del nostro Clan: cosa possiamo fare per riuscire allo stesso tempo a metterci in gioco personalmente e capire più a fondo ciò che succede intorno a noi? Come possiamo imparare, lungo il cammino, a trasformare in realtà anche i sogni più audaci e impensabili? Come possiamo agire impegnando innanzitutto noi stessi fino ad avere un impatto nelle cose lontane?Cercavamo un sogno in grado di contenere tutto questo, e quindi abbiamo scelto un obiettivo che fosse grande e difficile da realizzare.Trasformare questo sogno in realtà ha significato imparare a progettare e iniziare un cammino di preparazione un anno prima della nostra partenza. Ha significato anche affrontare tante difficoltà, impegnarsi a fondo per riuscire a rendere questo sogno un progetto concreto.L’obiettivo è diventato quindi effettuare un’esperienza di servizio dall’altra parte del mondo, in Ecuador, accompagnando tutto il percorso con un approfondimento teorico sul diritto all’umanità.L’Ecuador è considerato un paese in via di sviluppo, dove la povertà diffusa raggiunge apici impensabili nelle comunità montane. Proprio in una di queste comunità si concentrerà il nostro operato.COSA ABBIAMO GIÀ FATTO

Questo viaggio non nasce oggi, ma molti mesi fa. Crediamo che l’unico modo per realizzare un obiettivo sia quello di impegnarsi in prima persona. Per questo motivo negli ultimi 10 mesi siamo stati impegnati in diverse modalità di raccolta fondi:
attività di autofinanziamento (bancarelle di oggetti realizzati da noi, servizi a degli eventi, baby sitting, feste di compleanno, ecc..)
risparmio personale di 50€ mensili (essendo quasi tutti studenti tale somma non poteva che essere ricavata da alcune rinunce nella propria vita) in modo da dare ancora maggior valore al servizio che faremo
donazioni individuali e raccolta fondi sul territorio
campagna di crowdfunding sul web
Il risparmio personale e le attività di autofinanziamento hanno lo scopo di renderci i primi attori del progetto. Il nostro impegno è fondamentale per chiedere alle altre persone di credere nel progetto e sostenerci.IL PROGETTO

Il progetto prende forma dopo l’incontro con Don Claudio, missionario dell’operazione Mato Grosso, il quale ci propone di aiutarli nella realizzazione di alcune case nel paesino di Zumbahua (Ecuador).Uno dei problemi maggiori a Zumbahua è la mancanza di case dignitose e resistenti. Quasi tutti vivono in capanne di mattoni di fango e paglia e lamiera, che vengono spesso distrutte e divelte dalla pioggia e dal forte vento estivo.Il lavoro che possiamo svolgere è proprio la costruzione di due case più resistenti: le strade dissestate e i mancati collegamenti rendono questo lavoro molto lungo (i muratori locali sono solo due) e uno dei problemi principali è il trasporto dei materiali da cantiere.Con la mano d’opera, giovane ed entusiasta, di 26 ragazzi sarebbe infatti possibile costruire due case durante la nostra permanenza (20 giorni); il numero elevato permette infatti il veloce trasporto dei materiali (principalmente a piedi) e un aiuto sostanziale nelle più facili operazioni edilizie.Dunque il cuore del progetto sarà la realizzazione delle abitazioni, ma durante la nostra permanenza saremo impegnati anche in altre attività formative:
Un gemellaggio con un gruppo scout di Quito
Attività ricreative con i bambini di Zumbahua
Piccole escursioni sulle Ande

COME POTETE AIUTARCI
Qualsiasi  aiuto economico è benvenuto! Per raggiungere i soldi necessari dobbiamo arrivare a 3000 euro, e se decidi di donare anche solo 3 o 4 euro ci permetti di avvicinarci all'obiettivo.Se però puoi o vuoi dare un contributo più consistente, tanto meglio! Per chi decide di darci di più sono prevsite anche le ricompense che trovate a destra.Se la tua azienda ha intenzione di diventare sponsor ufficiale del nostro progetto, prendi contatto con noi a questa mail: clan.castelgoffredo1@gmail.com
IL BUDGET

Il budget necessario per realizzazione l’intero progetto è pari a circa 33.200€.
Raggiungeremo questa cifra attraverso 5 modalità di finanziamento:
i genitori dei 26 ragazzi hanno messo 250€ ciascuno per un totale di 6.500€
i ragazzi hanno deciso di attivarsi in un risparmio personale mensile di 50 € da Novembre 2015 fino a luglio 2016 per un totale di 11.700 €
L’attività di autofinanziamento ad oggi ha fruttato 5.000€ con l’obiettivo finale dopo le ultime attività estive di 7.000€
Sono fino ad ora arrivate donazioni pari a 5.000 €
Campagna di crowdfunding 3.000 €

COSA ABBIAMO IMPARATO FINO AD ORA

Qui un riassunto degli argomenti e degli obiettivi emersi durante gli incontri degli ultimi anni, che sono diventati parte del nostro progetto:

capacità di guardare al futuro con atteggiamento di fiducia, apertura e dialogo;
pensare in grande;
in una realtà “istantanea”, fatta  di gratificazioni immediate, occorre sviluppare la capacità di progettare a lungo termine;
prendersi la responsabilità di un impegno duraturo nel tempo;
pianificare obiettivi, azioni, risorse per compiere un progetto;
guardare le cose da un’altra prospettiva per essere più consapevoli;

disponibilità e apertura al cambiamento.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

 This property must meet the needs of the current participants, have 
long term sustainability (water, farming acres, etc) for our goals of 
becoming increasingly self-sufficient, allow plenty of living space for 
future community members to build dwellings, and potentially allow space
 for visitors, educational work trade, skillshare camp outs, and who 
knows what. <br/><br/> We currently have secured financing and are looking at 
properties. As most properties are not set up to accommodate pet goats 
or more than a “single family”, we anticipate initial financial burdens

for a larger community using the means of just a handful of current 
members, so to help alleviate some of the financial burden on the 
founding members, we are also pursuing crowdfunding.<br/> <br/> <b>2nd Objective:<br/> Live communally. </b><br/>
 Living communally reduces our need for manufacturing, transportation of
 goods and  dependence on capitalism, and replaces that with the mutual 
aid provided by friends who trust and support each other. The community 
we are creating will be non-hierarchical. All decisions will be made by 
consensus. <br/> <b><br/> 3rd Objective:<br/> Become increasingly self-sufficient. </b><br/>
 Over time we want to make the property able to sustain its inhabitants 
without the need of outside resources. We will have electricity, 
plumbing, and all those luxuries, but we want to work towards not needing
 them, or being able to go without them indefinitely if we wanted or 
needed to. The climate in our area is projected to have heavier rain in 
the winter and drier summers, so we will build rain catching systems to 
help reduce the draw from our water well in the summer. We will of 
course grow our own produce, forest farm in our wooded areas, then over 
time start taking on more projects and mastering new skills. Some 
examples include growing our own wheat for flour, herbs for medicine, 
making oils and vinegars, building a stove out of bricks made 
from our soil, and spinning fibers.<br/> <br/> <b>4th Objective:<br/> Share skills.</b><br/>
 Humans are basically something of a terrible plague on the earth. Humans who lived 
here before us lived (and in some places continue to live) harmoniously 
with nature. We're hoping, with some expected trial and error, that it is
 still possible for us to live sustainably, without the need to import goods 
and resources. That's where we're hoping to get at some point. With this property, we aim to foster each others' efforts to decivilize 
and relearn skills for living which do not contribute to the destruction
 of the earth.<br/><div>

<div>The Sleepy Snoogu hats are available in newborn, 1 year and 2 year sizes. Contact us if you would like a bigger size. </div>
<div><b>Q: How big are the Sleep Snoogus?</b></div>
<div>Each Snoogu is about 35cm tall, not counting the Bunny ears. Sophea the Sleep Bunny is the tallest if you count her ears :)</div>
<b>Q: How is the employment your offer sustainable? </b><div>
<p></p>
<p>A: We offer a way for those in poor communities
to make a living within their homes by providing paid training, supplying all
materials to producers so they don’t have to invest their own money in advance
and traveling to the communities regularly to collect finished products and
providing on-going training. By allowing producers to work from their own
homes, we ensure that they can continue to receive income regardless of
external factors such as transport costs or childcare needs. By focusing on
creating high quality products, we aim to ensure that this provides a viable
profession and source of income for the future.  </p>
<p><b>Q: Do you provide any other benefits to your
producers?</b></p>
<p>A: Although our producers work on a piece rate and
are home-based we provide additional benefits for them such as an emergency
medical fund, transportation for health emergencies, annual eye exams and free glasses,
performance bonuses and maternity leave. We also give first priority to our
home-based producers when full-time positions open at our headquarters and
offer training courses in relevant topics such as personal financial management
and health and hygiene. And from September, with your help, we will
provide scholarships for children of our producers.</p>
<p><b>Q: Where do you ship? </b></p>
<p>A: We ship worldwide! </p>
<p><b>Q: What if I want something different?</b></p>
<p>A: We hope that our new line offers something for
everyone. However, if you have any special requests – a product in a different
colour or a specific animal for a special person – please contact us and we will
see what we can do.</p>
<p><b>Q: Are your dolls child safe?</b></p>
<p>A: Safety is important in the making of our dolls,
ensuring they are safe for young children. We have made sure to pay close
attention to every step of the process, taking into careful consideration our
targeted age range. Each doll is handcrafted with 80% cotton/20% milk fiber
yarn, securely sewn together and stuffed with 100% new polyester fill</p>

<p>Do you enjoy a good book on a rainy day? Or sitting by the fire on a cold day with a good book? Or sitting on the beach with a good book? Basically, do you like books? We do too. That's why we want to start a bookstore downtown Grand Rapids.</p>
<p>Last April, I went to an independent bookstore out in Kalamazoo with some friends. What was supposed to take half an hour browsing for new books, turned into 2 hours. I miss being able to do that downtown Grand Rapids. Unlike the last downtown bookstore, Page Turners won't be just a 5-year experiment. Page Turners will be a staple in this ever growing city. Being surrounded by books makes me feel both excited and at home.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. Starting a bookstore from scratch costs a bit of money and we are not a millionaires, so we're going to need your help! The good news though is it'll only take roughly 3% of the Grand Rapids population contributing $5 to make this bookstore happen. </p>
<p>Page Turners will be a place where people are welcomed to come in and browse. Maybe discover something new or check out some of the local artist's work displayed for sale on the wall. Self-published authors will be encouraged to sell their books here. Page Turners will become part of Grand Rapids. A place where the local books nerds can call home.</p>
<p>Teachers, administrators, and librarians will enjoy a certain % off all orders. It is our goal to support local schools in Grand Rapids and the people that work for them. We're asking Grand Rapids to buy local, so we want to support local in any way we can. </p>

<p>My name is Tami C. I am the owner of IMENA Inc. We are a beauty company based in NYC. For the past 4 years we have built a salon business in Harlem, NY. We have a unique system of salon membership that our clients and stylists really enjoy. Clients pay one price and get all of their hair care needs taken care of. There are several things that make us different from other beauty salons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients are seen when they arrive. We have an excellent track record of honoring the time of our client members.</li>
<li>Clients get different types of styles with one membership. this allows them to be versatile without having to worry about price.</li>
<li>We work together with stylists to teach techniques on how to care for all types of hair from curly, coily to straight.</li>
<li>Stylists get paid on time and enjoy having control and flexibility over their schedules and the clients they accept.</li>
<li>Our client members can come to our location in Harlem or get service at one of our partner salon locations in New Jersey, Bronx and South Harlem.</li>
<li>Clients get discounts on products and events given by IMENA.</li>
<li>Stylists get ongoing education and training. We host most of these trainings at our salon location in Harlem.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a new and innovative way for clients to get hair and beauty services and for professionals to do business in this industry. And we are very happy to provide this service to the public through our IMENA membership.</p>
<p>From the beginning when we first opened our location, one of the things we have struggled with is marketing and promotion. In order to grow we need more people to learn about us, and join our IMENA membership. Paying rent on our salon space every month eats up a large portion of our income on a monthly basis.  In order for us to continue in our salon space in Harlem we are looking to raise enough money to pay off the rent for the time remaining on the lease (12 months) so we can focus our income on strategies (marketing and promotion) to grow the business. <i><strong>We are asking you to please make a donation in any amount to help use reach this goal so we can stay in our salon space in Harlem.</strong></i></p>
<p>Prior to owning this business I was a social worker. I have always had a large part of my heart and my purpose rooted in doing things that benefit community. I believe our salon space in Harlem does just that. It allows people (mostly women) to have a safe space to express their hair needs, to learn about the beauty of themselves, and to feel supported in their hair and beauty journeys. Also, a portion of the proceeds from our salon goes to support charitable organizations. So when you help us you help your community as well.</p>
<p><i><strong>I believe we are doing great work. But we need more people to know about us. </strong></i>We can only accomplish that through marketing. If we pay off our lease we will have the ability to expand and be successful. We will be able to advertise, vend and sponsor more events like CIRCLE OF SISTERS, CURL FEST and AFRO PUNK, which are some of the popular events in NYC. We will be able to market on popular websites and blogs like <a href=""http://www.IDONTDOCLUBS.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.IDONTDOCLUBS.com</a> to promote our membership.  So please support us in our campaign so we can continue to do the work in the community we love.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what we need</strong>: <i><strong>$35,000 </strong></i>to pay off the remaining balance of our lease.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Because we need to put the revenue earned back into the business to be successful in our current salon space without the burden of rent. <i><u>If we do not raise the money we will have to close our salon location in Harlem.</u></i> We want to keep this space so we can continue to serve the Harlem community. Any amount raised will go toward the next steps for the business including possibly finding a new space or continuing the work through virtual means.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>I want to sincerely thank you all for your help and contribution. I believe that together we can make a difference in our communities and it starts with us supporting one another. So please make your donation today. With your help, I know we can make it happen! </p>

I’ve learned how to garden, had years of practice, and received a lot of mentorship from other gardeners and nurserymen around the county. I also have almost ten years of experience in customer service, sales, marketing, and supervising. All this has given me the encouragement I need to exit the daily office grind and go to work for myself. I plan to join the thousands of other small plot intensive farmers around the world and feed MY community with produce grown down the road rather than a few thousand miles away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>About our market</h3><p>Almost Eden Gardens and Nursery is located right in the middle of Northwest Arkansas and, even more importantly, right in the middle of our city. Rather than being off out in the country, we have 4+ acres that occupies the middle of a city block. As a bonus, Almost Eden is less than five minutes from the main interstate that feeds the region. This location gives me the unique opportunity to sell the produce right off the farm rather than transporting it to a farmer’s market.  I also have close access to a bustling wholesale market of locally owned grocery stores and restaurants.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>About the competition</h3><p>Our region has exploded with small farms and a number of busy farmer’s markets. I am less than 15 minutes away from three Wal-Mart Super Centers, two Wal-Mart Neighborhood Markets, and three other locally owned grocery stores. All of that may sound like competition, but to me it sounds like there are plenty of people buying groceries. The locally owned grocery stores and various natural food stores are also a potential wholesale customer as they often have local produce available.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>The risks</h3><p>Weather, bugs, and diseases are the big three to worry about when dealing with plants. The primary reason I intend to keep growing nursery stock AND produce is to diversify where the income is coming from. Outlets for the market produce include Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), on farm sales, and wholesale sales to locally owned restaurants, hotels, and grocery stores.  The nursery stock will continue to be sold on the farm and shipped out through ecommerce.</p><p> </p><h3>
<br/>The rewards</h3><p>Who wouldn’t want a bag of fresh picked greens grown down the road instead of a bag of lettuce that was picked a week ago and shipped across the country? Carrots picked the day before instead of weeks before being sold? Potatoes dug a few days instead of months before being sold? Wouldn’t you want to see where your food came from, walk on the same dirt, see the plants, and meet the people that picked your tomatoes? </p><p>For me, as a grower, the rewards come in tangible and intangible means. I get to support myself and my family doing something I love.  I get to support my community with fresh and healthy produce and plants.  I get to support our local environment by reducing, just a little bit, the amount of food that must be trucked 100s and even 1,000s of miles.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>What have I put into the business?</h3><p>I left my full time job and put my entire retirement into this expansion. That money will  buy seeds, planting and harvesting equipment, a hoop house, and it will help support myself and my family while the business grows (pun intended).  I purchased a small tractor two years ago that I use for breaking ground and moving dirt, compost, mulch, etc. around the property.  Of course, there are also the four + acres that the nursery and farm sits on that would probably be worth way more as an office and a parking lot.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>The funds raised here will help me purchase…</h3><p>-A BCS walking tractor: One of the most labor saving devices on a small, intensive farm. A walking tractor like the BCS allows for the gentle cultivation of our soil rather than ground-pounding tillage. It can also be fitted with an array of attachments so, unlike a conventional tiller, it is a multitasker not a unitasker.

<h3>Hey Young World. The World Is Yours.</h3>
<p>The perfect line from Legendary MC Slick Rick. The ideal mantra for our brand, Little Nomad. We are dedicated to creating and sourcing engaging and meaningful goods for your little ones. Our brand, inspired by curiosity, exploration, and community, aims to be a modern alternative to typical retailers. Our name aims to express the wonders of life shown by our little ones. It also serves as our family's acronym - <strong>No</strong>ra, <strong>M</strong>yka, <strong>A</strong>nt, <strong>D</strong>evan. </p>

<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>Anthony has an extensive background in retail with roles on both the operational and visual side. He currently holds two jobs that directly speak to his passions. Working at the non-profit The Robinson Theater in North Church Hill VA, he is able to engage with and inspire his community on a daily basis. He also spends his mornings at Ledbury selling a top notch product and gaining even more retail insight. Nora is an Early Childhood Special Educator, graduating with her master's degree in Early Childhood Special Education from Virginia Commonwealth University. Recently, Nora became Adjunct Faculty in the School of Professional and Continuing Studies at The University of Richmond.</p>

<h3><strong>The Big Idea</strong></h3>
<p>The idea for Little Nomad came from an unexpected place. When we became parents in 2012,  we didn't anticipate such a supportive and welcoming community of families.  We didn’t expect to become friends with other adults simply because we both had children. We didn’t expect to be in a babysitting cooperative.</p>
<p>Out of conversations with other parents in our community grew an idea for a shop that we feel our city is missing - a modern children’s apparel shop. We want to provide a space where <strong>ALL </strong>feel comfortable and represented; a space that showcases high quality, independently produced items that are accessible in price; a space that highlights our local talent and makers.</p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Our City Needs This</strong></p>
<p>Richmond is slated to become home to numerous new businesses. More young professionals and families are flocking to the city in numbers we havent seen in decades. New homes, apartments, and hotels are being built within close proximity. City dwellers expect access to local shopping opportunities. With such a rich history, the Jackson Ward neighborhood and Broad Street corridor make the perfect location for Little Nomad. After many years of neglect, this corridor is once again becoming a destination for locals and out of towners. Little Nomad fills a void in the local shopping scene.  </p>
<p><b>Partnerships and Collaborations are Important</b> </p>
<p>One of the best parts of being a small business is helping other small businesses find success. Our goal is to facilitate this success through our shop by using, selling, promoting, and collaborating with other great local products and businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Brick and Mortar Retail Is Alive</strong> </p>
<p>We see this space not only for retail, but as a space created for community focused events, including conversations with local authors and artists, civic meetings, networking gatherings, and workshops focused on the health and wellness of families and our children.</p>
<p>We understand that  selling a shirt isn't going to change the world, but we strongly believe we can change the narrative of what a locally owned shop can do and be for<strong> ALL </strong>of the community.</p>

</p><p>When Zack was 6 years old he was playing in his room and got the idea to
stuff his old Pajamas with balls from his ball pit then added his stuffed animal dog. Just
like that Puppy Man was born. </p>
<p>After playing with the original Puppy, Man Zack and his dad went to the store
and bought some stuffing and created the first Puppy Man with stuffing. Zack
showed puppy man to his friends and many of them wanted their own. </p>
<p>Zack convinced his dad to make more Puppy Mans for his friends. After a lot of
work and searching Zack and his dad were able to find a factory that could
produce 18” and 36” stuffed animals. Launching this business has been a great
learning experience for Zack where he has been able to take his idea from concept
to production. </p>
<p>Puppy Man is the first stuffed animal in a line of stuffed animals called
Pajama Pals that Zack is launching. We have had a number of Puppy Mans produced and ready to ship. </p><p>Puppy Man is offered in 18"" &amp; 36"" sizes, and we are also offering a 18"" &amp; 36"" Limited Collectors edition. The limited collectors edition will be the first 100 of each size shipped. They will come with a collectors edition Pajama Pals tag that is numbered and signed by Zack.  </p>
<p>Zack has a dream to build a factory in the USA and transform his many ideas
into products. This is your opportunity to purchase his company’s first
product, and be a key contributor to a 9-year-old boy’s first business venture.
</p>

stuff his old Pajamas with balls from his ball pit then added his stuffed animal dog. Just
like that Puppy Man was born. 
After playing with the original Puppy, Man Zack and his dad went to the store
and bought some stuffing and created the first Puppy Man with stuffing. Zack
showed puppy man to his friends and many of them wanted their own. 
Zack convinced his dad to make more Puppy Mans for his friends. After a lot of
work and searching Zack and his dad were able to find a factory that could
produce 18” and 36” stuffed animals. Launching this business has been a great
learning experience for Zack where he has been able to take his idea from concept
to production. 
Puppy Man is the first stuffed animal in a line of stuffed animals called
Pajama Pals that Zack is launching. We have had a number of Puppy Mans produced and ready to ship. Puppy Man is offered in 18"" & 36"" sizes, and we are also offering a 18"" & 36"" Limited Collectors edition. The limited collectors edition will be the first 100 of each size shipped. They will come with a collectors edition Pajama Pals tag that is numbered and signed by Zack.  
Zack has a dream to build a factory in the USA and transform his many ideas
into products. This is your opportunity to purchase his company’s first
product, and be a key contributor to a 9-year-old boy’s first business venture.

We are aiming to raise $10k to help fund the initial launch of the
business and if we are able to exceed this amount we will look to use the
additional funds to launch up to 4 new Pajama Pals animals.

<h2><strong>Hello!</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SoundSpace </strong>is looking to become Asheville’s first full-fledged music practice space facility. We will be serving the critical needs of the music community, touring and local musicians alike. Soundspace will be created as a place of support for artists amidst the rapidly growing industry of music in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Soundspace </strong>believes it will serve as a powerful, creative hub that will help to enrich and grow Asheville’s vibrant music scene, strengthening the abilities of anyone who wishes to play an instrument, while providing workspace for our many music professionals.</p>
<p><strong>SoundSpace</strong> is managed and owned by musicians Claude Coleman Jr. and Brett Spivey, both Asheville residents with lifelong careers in music and studios domestically and abroad, in addition to having experience as builders and studio owners themselves.</p>
<p><strong>SoundSpace at </strong>Rabbit's will feature state-of-the-art music rehearsal spaces, hourly, and monthly rental spaces, and a dance/movement studio.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520907857/oxdspkflxhcgsp941xpq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>SoundSpace</strong> will also feature a soul-food café. The property we are trying to acquire is the famed Rabbit’s Café and Motel, in the Southside area of downtown. We are thrilled to honor the legacy and history of Rabbit’s Café and Motel and humbled to partner with Clarence Robinson (#FlavorKing) A-B Tech Culinary Graduate and local chef who grew up behind the Motel and is a relative of the original owner. The motel was used for the touring Negro baseball leagues, of which Asheville had a dominant team. We wish to feature murals on our building sides that will honor all of this history!</p>

</div><div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>What We Need!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>SoundSpace</strong> is seeking <strong>$70,000</strong> to cover purchasing the property and complete renovation of the property to provide four state-of-the-art rehearsal rooms in the motel, averaging 13'x17' each, a soul-food kitchen, a lounge and office space in the front.</p>
<p>Anything over this amount or even close to this amount will bring us closer to our goal of a project that we are not giving up on!</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>SoundSpace</strong> will be community based and created by musicians. There will be discounted time-periods, free rentals to music students, and workshops and clinics.

PLEASE VISIT OUR ROUND II FUNDRAISER!! 

Hello!
 
SoundSpace is looking to become Asheville’s first full-fledged music practice space facility. We will be serving the critical needs of the music community, touring and local musicians alike. Soundspace will be created as a place of support for artists amidst the rapidly growing industry of music in the area.
Soundspace believes it will serve as a powerful, creative hub that will help to enrich and grow Asheville’s vibrant music scene, strengthening the abilities of anyone who wishes to play an instrument, while providing workspace for our many music professionals.
SoundSpace is managed and owned by musicians Claude Coleman Jr. and Brett Spivey, both Asheville residents with lifelong careers in music and studios domestically and abroad, in addition to having experience as builders and studio owners themselves.
SoundSpace at Rabbit's will feature state-of-the-art music rehearsal spaces, hourly, and monthly rental spaces, and a dance/movement studio.

SoundSpace will also feature a soul-food café. The property we are trying to acquire is the famed Rabbit’s Café and Motel, in the Southside area of downtown. We are thrilled to honor the legacy and history of Rabbit’s Café and Motel and humbled to partner with Clarence Robinson (#FlavorKing) A-B Tech Culinary Graduate and local chef who grew up behind the Motel and is a relative of the original owner. The motel was used for the touring Negro baseball leagues, of which Asheville had a dominant team. We wish to feature murals on our building sides that will honor all of this history!


 
What We Need!
SoundSpace is seeking $70,000 to cover purchasing the property and complete renovation of the property to provide four state-of-the-art rehearsal rooms in the motel, averaging 13'x17' each, a soul-food kitchen, a lounge and office space in the front.
Anything over this amount or even close to this amount will bring us closer to our goal of a project that we are not giving up on!

My dad owned a restaurant when I was a kid and took us out picking nettles and gathering sloes; which sparked a passion... I later became a single mother to Steil, my eldest son, and was for most of his life. During that time I have worked in an Artisan Bakery with pastry, and in a Biodynamic butchers (I make a mean wild garlic sausage!). More recently have taught courses in foraging as Ashdown Forage and worked cooking as a private chef for families and businesses.</p><p>I had run Ashdown Forage for several years, teaching foraging and preserving and brewing courses on a small scale, including catering. But as a single mother and without funds, expanding it to encompass all that I love or could do seemed impossible. Then I met Josh. We fell pregnant fast and he was (and is) the most supportive partner and father, and was enthusiastic not only to support me in my dream, but to grow it to include his dream of a self-propelled future, of creating a community space that supports musical artists and nourishes through music. Of being able to support our family and ourselves by doing things that we love, and that benefit others. Because of him and as a team, anything feels possible. Including raising enough money to make this dream a reality. And that is where you come in!</p><p><strong>THE FOODIE FORAGER Ethical Festival and Events Caterer.</strong></p><p>We started The Foodie Forager because I love good, real, whole food, that doesn't feel austere. We love turning relatively lowly ingredients and foraged flourishes into food that nourishes not only the body, but also the soul. The feeling of community created by nurturing people, the difference it can make to the atmosphere, and the feeling of pride when everyone feels like they are being looked after and taken care of in this way, is palpable. I am passionate about reducing food waste within our own kitchens and as a nation, and I'm expanding into online courses that will incorporate this, as well as running in-person courses at events. I also believe great crew are an asset and should be valued as such. A good friend often says 'Do what you love, it's your gift to Universe'...

<p>Red Dragon Gaming is a community focused game store in New Ulm, Minnesota. Our open play area provides a place for gamers to find others who share their interersts, and our game demos and workshops make it easier than ever for new players to find games they love. For the more established players, we have tournaments and leagues where they can pit their skills against others and see who is top of the game.</p>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>Red Dragon Gaming is the fault of Allen ""AJ"" Juhnke, a lover of RPGs and table-top wargames. Moving to New Ulm from St. Cloud, AJ missed the joy of hanging out at a friendly local game store and realized that if he wanted to have that experience in his new home, he'd have to provide it himself. For AJ, the community is everything, and he's willing to sacrifice whatever it takes to support it.</p>
<p>AJ brought his friend and sometimes Dungeon Master Travis Theurer into the project as soon as he realized that opening a store was too much work for one person. Travis has been gaming for more than 20 years and he is looking forward to encouraging new players to pick up and try games for the first time. You can often find him standing at the demo tables encouraging people to check out the latest game.</p>
<p>Julie Lovell agreed to be a part of Red Dragon Gaming so that she could encourage more young girls and women to be a part of the gaming community. It is her fervent desire that the stereotype of gaming being a male pasttime be thoroughly smashed. She knows that there is much more to gaming beyond simple competition and one-upsmanship that most women never get a chance to experience.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Products - </strong>Half of the funds raised will be going directly into products to put on the shelves. These include Magic boosters, D&amp;D books, Warhammer miniatures, DiceMasters sets, and board and other games, as well as pop, chips, energy drinks, and candy bars.</p>
<p><strong>Tables &amp; Chairs - </strong>These will be heavy-duty tables and chairs for use in the gaming area. We're looking to start with 10 tables and 60 chairs. As the store grows, we will add additional tables and chairs.</p>
<p><strong>Cash Register - </strong>We have no idea why these things are so expensive, but they are. This covers the cost of the computer itself, the barcode scanner, the receipt printer and the cash drawer, everything needed to complete a transaction and let you take your new toys home.</p>
<p><strong>Misc. - </strong>You want the store to be clean and well lit; so do we. In addition to light bulbs to keep things bright and cleaning supplies to keep things shiny, this also covers printer paper (for those tournament pairings), poker chips (for our poker nights), and any other incidental item that we haven't yet realized we're going to need.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Supporting Red Dragon Gaming makes you special, and everyone needs to know just how special you are. To achieve this, every physical item that we are offering as part of this campaign will be branded with ""I Gave the Dragon Life"" a unique slogan that will never again be offered. Show it to your friends and family so that they can see just how special you are.</p>
<p><b>Store Credit - </b>A portion of your contribution will be made available to you as store credit after we open. The exact details are not yet finalized, but rest assured, we are looking for ways to give you back as much or your contribution as we can. Watch for updates discussing our thought processes, and provide any feedback you can.</p>
<p><strong>Coffee Mug - </strong>This coffee mug is stainless steel with a removable lid for easy cleaning. On one side will be the Red Dragon Gaming logo, and written across the other will be the campaign slogan, ""I Gave the Dragon Life""</p>
<p><strong>T-Shirt - </strong>Our t-shirts come in your choice of colors and a variety of sizes. Emblazoned upon the front will be the Red Dragon Gaming logo, and written across the back will be the campaign slogan, ""I Gave the Dragon Life""</p>
<p><strong>Shopping Bag - </strong>This canvas shopping bag is perfectly sized to carry all of your purchases out of the store, or carry all of your favorite games down to the open play area for some good times with friends. On each side of the bag you will find the Red Dragon Gaming Logo, beneath which will be the campaign slogan, ""I Gave the Dragon Life""</p>
<p><strong>Name Plaque - </strong>This plaque will be prominantly displayed upon the wall of Red Dragon Gaming, listing the names of the Friends of the Dragon. Each name will be engraved into an individual metal plate, and the plates will be mounted onto a beautiful wooden panel.</p>
<p><strong>Photo Plaque - </strong>Reserved for our most giving backers, each Blood of the Dragon backer will be featured on an individual plaque prominately displayed in the store. These commemorative plaques will feature a photograph of the backer, along with their name, personal quote, and other information engraved into a metal plate.</p>

<h3>What Your Contributions Mean</h3>
<p>Reaching our campaign goal will ensure that we can open Red Dragon Gaming debt free, setting us on a course to remain open for years to come. By removing the financial burdens normally associated with starting a business, you are allowing us to focus on what you want most, games, tournaments, leagues, and events. Never will we have to choose between holding an exciting event and paying the utility bill to keep the lights on.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In spite of all of the preparation that has gone into opening Red Dragon Gaming, no business venture is without risk. Unexpected costs always have a way of cropping up when a business can least afford it. The greatest risk that we face is that such a cost may be to much for us to bear, leaving us with no choice but to close our doors.</p>
<p>We are taking every precaution that we can think of to protect ourselves from this risk. We have insurance against theft, fire, liability, etc. All of our fixtures are checked to make sure they are of the highest quality. And, only professionals are performing the remodelling to ensure that all work is completed satisfactorily </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't support us financially, that doesn't mean that you can't help us. Tell your friends about our campaign. Share it on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms using the share tools right on the campaign page. And, most importantly, stop into the store once we've opened and play some games. This whole endeavor is for the community. You are more than welcome.</p>

</div></div>","Red Dragon Gaming is a community focused game store in New Ulm, Minnesota. Our open play area provides a place for gamers to find others who share their interersts, and our game demos and workshops make it easier than ever for new players to find games they love. For the more established players, we have tournaments and leagues where they can pit their skills against others and see who is top of the game.
Who We Are
Red Dragon Gaming is the fault of Allen ""AJ"" Juhnke, a lover of RPGs and table-top wargames. Moving to New Ulm from St. Cloud, AJ missed the joy of hanging out at a friendly local game store and realized that if he wanted to have that experience in his new home, he'd have to provide it himself. For AJ, the community is everything, and he's willing to sacrifice whatever it takes to support it.
AJ brought his friend and sometimes Dungeon Master Travis Theurer into the project as soon as he realized that opening a store was too much work for one person. Travis has been gaming for more than 20 years and he is looking forward to encouraging new players to pick up and try games for the first time. You can often find him standing at the demo tables encouraging people to check out the latest game.
Julie Lovell agreed to be a part of Red Dragon Gaming so that she could encourage more young girls and women to be a part of the gaming community. It is her fervent desire that the stereotype of gaming being a male pasttime be thoroughly smashed. She knows that there is much more to gaming beyond simple competition and one-upsmanship that most women never get a chance to experience.

<h3>Our GiG of a Lifetime</h3>
<p>For the past several months our biggest gig has been planning, research and development on an app that can simplify the way we do ordinary and extraordinary things. Because everyday tasks range from the boring and mundane to the surprising and unexpected, our planning and our end product will be similarly complex and flexible. Our goals, however, are very precise.</p>
<p>While our life might involve hundreds of different gigs a day we only have one and it’s called <strong>GiGaround</strong>. And we take it very seriously. But before we can provide the best crowd-sourced solutions we need to crowd-source some help from you. </p>
<h3>A GiG for Everyone</h3>
<p>The idea for GiGaround was born along with a renewed sense of community developing in Cyprus after years of austerity and under the influence of that growing revolution known as the Uberisation of industry. Our founders saw the power of crowd-sourcing, civic duty and neighborly actions but didn't have a problem of seeing the crowd for the people. We see that everyone has a unique gig they were born to rock! <strong>With our technology, efficiency and real-time precision we can empower you to find the perfect fit for what you need</strong>, <strong>or let you become the perfect fit for someone else’s job.</strong></p>
<h3>GiGaround's Goals</h3>
<p>With your help, the completed GiGaround mobile application will be an advanced real-time <strong>peer-to-peer hiring platform</strong> (known also as a <strong>service-based marketplace)</strong> placing emphasis on community relationships, user rewards and reviews.  </p>
<p>From the beginning, our investment, planning and focus has never strayed from GiGaround's three primary goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>To acquire a well built and secure mobile application with industry leading native architecture, Yii framework for web platforms and MVC backend capabilities as a foundation for GiGaround's marketplace.</li>
<li>To maintain sufficient marketing and business infrastructure so as to attract and retain an awesome community of GiGsters that will make our marketplace prolific and dependable.</li>
<li><p>To implement, enforce and monitor a rock solid rating system that guarantees the reputation and efficiency of GiGsters as well as the quality of task completion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong></p>
<p>1 .    <strong>SEARCH and REQUEST</strong></p>
<p>A user registers, provides basic details, fees range/budget and types of preset interests and activity tags. They can Search for GiGsters using these tags or Request a GiGster for a real-time task with pricing and timeline constraints.</p>
<p>2.   <strong>  MATCHING</strong></p>
<p>User contacts a GiGster who applies to the search tag or receives a real-time notification from an available GiGster who is interested in the terms. The user can analyze potential GiGsters according to reputation and reviews. Next, a basic communication client within the app is initiated between the two users. Within that client they further refine price, timeline or any other terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Chat in the beginning phase of a gig ensures maximum possible anonymity to each user's profile. Once further details have been refined and a preliminary contract is accepted from the chat moves to a second more visible and interactive state including image/file sharing and most importantly, GPS tracking. </p>
<p>3. <strong>    TRACKING</strong></p>
<p>The advanced communication client remains open to track the ETA of the GiGster and the progress of the contract. After the service is completed (whether remotely or in person), the GiGster will initiate a completion request with a proof input value (description, image/file) to be confirmed by the user in order to initiate payment phase.</p>
<p>If there is a rejection, complaint or any related dispute a flag will be raised and the issue will be forwarded to admins outside of the native app. The user will be immediately notified and moved to browse other nearby GiGsters providing similar services. Specific flags and repeat offenders can result in disciplinary action.</p>
<p>4.   <strong>  PAYMENT</strong></p>
<p>Pауmеnt іѕ fast аnd simple, оnсе the tаѕk has been completed. Whеn both thе сuѕtоmеr аnd user meet fасе to fасе and the task is executed, or if the terms have been fulfilled remotely, рауmеnt takes place аutоmаtісаllу according to user preference on registration.</p>
<p>It's a ѕесurе, “wіn-wіn” аrrаngеmеnt fоr bоth раrtіеѕ. The customer then moves to a rating screen to evaluate the GiGster's services. Rating іѕ enforced and essential tо GiGaround bесаuѕе it hеlрѕ a nеw сuѕtоmеr decide whether to approve a ѕеrvісе provider bеfоrе booking a tаѕk. It аlѕо hеlрѕ tо buіld trust in our community.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>App Completion Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Once funding is secured there will be three development milestones which will only require 17 weeks in total to complete. </p>
<p>1st Milestone (Foundation Phase) - 5 weeks </p>
<p>2nd Milestone (50% Development Completion) - 6 weeks</p>
<p>3rd Milestone (100% Development and Debugging Completion - 6 weeks</p>
<h3>Supporting GiGaround</h3>
<p>The distance between what we have and what we envision is not far off and this is why we are choosing Indiegogo and, particularly, its “keep it all model” of funding for this project. We have currently invested heavily in this project and are committed to the community that we’ve envisioned and you’ve been intrigued enough to research this far. And by the way, we appreciate it!</p>
<p>So what happens if you decide to go beyond curiosity and join the GiGaround community? <strong>Look into our perk offers or visit our website for more!</strong></p>

Once further details have been refined and a preliminary contract is accepted from the chat moves to a second more visible and interactive state including image/file sharing and most importantly, GPS tracking. 
3.     TRACKING
The advanced communication client remains open to track the ETA of the GiGster and the progress of the contract. After the service is completed (whether remotely or in person), the GiGster will initiate a completion request with a proof input value (description, image/file) to be confirmed by the user in order to initiate payment phase.
If there is a rejection, complaint or any related dispute a flag will be raised and the issue will be forwarded to admins outside of the native app. The user will be immediately notified and moved to browse other nearby GiGsters providing similar services. Specific flags and repeat offenders can result in disciplinary action.
4.     PAYMENT
Pауmеnt іѕ fast аnd simple, оnсе the tаѕk has been completed. Whеn both thе сuѕtоmеr аnd user meet fасе to fасе and the task is executed, or if the terms have been fulfilled remotely, рауmеnt takes place аutоmаtісаllу according to user preference on registration.
It's a ѕесurе, “wіn-wіn” аrrаngеmеnt fоr bоth раrtіеѕ. The customer then moves to a rating screen to evaluate the GiGster's services. Rating іѕ enforced and essential tо GiGaround bесаuѕе it hеlрѕ a nеw сuѕtоmеr decide whether to approve a ѕеrvісе provider bеfоrе booking a tаѕk. It аlѕо hеlрѕ tо buіld trust in our community.

App Completion Timeline
Once funding is secured there will be three development milestones which will only require 17 weeks in total to complete. 
1st Milestone (Foundation Phase) - 5 weeks 
2nd Milestone (50% Development Completion) - 6 weeks
3rd Milestone (100% Development and Debugging Completion - 6 weeks

<h3>Red's Story</h3>
<p>At Red’s Smokehouse, we are all committed to sharing our love of BBQ with as many people as we can. The best way we know how to spread happiness is by giving people food they love!</p>
<p>Our specialty is smokehouse style BBQ with a twist. Our full menu includes smoked, boldly flavored, seasonal dishes. We focus on using local products and partner with local and family owned businesses whenever possible. We believe that by creating a restaurant that offers the best ingredients, most delicious flavors, and the friendliest people, our customers will keep coming back for more.</p>
<p>Red has spent years cooking in a variety of kitchens - everywhere from the UP to Tennessee. She has worked her way up from fast food kitchens to fine dining! If you ask her, the most rewarding part of being a chef is seeing people thoroughly enjoy the recipes you have perfected!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Bring Red's Food to Her Favorite Community</h3>
<p>The Eastside community is where the business started and where it was meant to expand. This is the reason for this specific space and the needs for the funds. With the goal of opening our new restaurant in early 2017, we’ve got a lot of work to do. The new 1,200-square-foot space will include a state of the art kitchen, a small dining area, a deli, and a take-out counter. We are converting an old office space from the ground up!</p>
<p>Building a restaurant is serious business and seriously expensive! To make this a reality, we need your help!</p>
<p>The entire build-out will cost us at least $80,000. We are asking for $40,000. Yes, that’s some serious cash, but by getting this support, we will be able to keep our food prices down for the residents of our community!   </p>
<p>The funds we raise will be used for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Converting office space into fully-functional restaurant</li>
<li>Health Department permits and fees</li>
<li>Equipment: freezer, grill, fridge, stove</li>
<li>Contractor fees: plumbing, electrical</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>Sense of Community</h3>
<p>The Eastside community of Lansing has always supported us and we want to do our part in offering them great food at an affordable price. We want to help the community thrive and that means keeping our prices reasonable and hiring local employees. To support other local food startups, we plan to feature vendors in the kitchen on different nights of the week. We will also create a space for one of our favorites local bakers - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/glutenfreerox"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gluten Free Rox</a>! We truly believe we are all stronger together!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk is high to start a new restaurant business and we know that the key to success is to provide a quality product with great service. If we do not get all the funds needed, we will delay the deli for a few months. There is many challenges as you build out a space, planning is key and we have a solid plan in place.</p>

These years, called the<strong> «Roaring Twenties» or the 1920s,</strong> have produced incredible creativity accross the world in all fields: artistic, industrial, cinematographic ...</p><p>Fashion and design underline the tragedy of the First World War.</p><p>This page of History corresponds to me. This joyful and creative resilience resonates in me. So much so that I launched in March 2017 the Creations of the Unicorn to bring back this spirit.<br/>I chine and restore old objects: old lace, patinated furniture, tarnished mirrors, dented jewelry ... all have a soul and tell their little story in great history.</p><p>I create, sew and make. headbands, hats or dresses, feathers and pearls, lace and embroidery ... I rely on my creative talent and the technical and artistic legacy of <strong>my grandmother Louise. Clothing designer</strong>, she passed on her passion, her vision and her know-how.</p><p>Today, I come to share with you this universe and this joyful inspiration.</p><p><strong>And I need you is to continue this positive vision of history and the world, and to grow my business.</strong></p><p>Today, I sew my creations and restore old objects stuck on a corner table in my living room.<br/>I dream of opening my own shop to welcome my clients, to expose my original creations as well as the collection of furniture and objects that I have found.</p><p>My shop would also be my workshop where I could present the fabrics, beads and feathers with which I work. I could sew, embroider, advise and train at this time very present in my daily life.</p><p>To develop my business, I need two machines to make Cornely embroidery to enrich my embroidery creations. A profession that I have practiced previously and that my mother can always teach me because she was a Cornely embroiderer and realized the 1st models for the greatest fashion designers such as Christian Lacroix.</p><p>I also need a van rather than a car to be able to transport all my equipment in the various fairs and events in which I participate in France or accross the world. I also need them to transport the furniture I make to prepare them and then deliver them if necessary to my clients.</p><p>Little by little I built a clientele that buy my creations be it wedding dresses, evening dresses, headband and hats, but also the furniture that I restore in Shabby style. I also became a reference in that historical period. I also realize creative workshops with beginngers that I hope will be able to welcome in a better way in my workshop-boutique or in differents places, cities and countries.</p><p>Recently, a customer ordered me a dress for climbing the stairs in <strong>Cannes</strong>. A couple ordered furniture from me to decorate their bed and breakfast.</p><p>For example, I am invited to represent my creations at the International <strong>Convention Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries International Convention in June 2018 in the United States, in Portland, Oregon.</strong></p><p>I need this <strong>flexible crowdfunding</strong> to achieve my different <strong>goals step by step</strong>.</p><p>Creating is all my life. I like to create every day. My grandmother gave me all her know-how as a sewing designer, her inspiration that she drew from everyday life and a very good knowledge of <strong>the years 20 -30</strong>.</p><p>My creations are inspired by icons of the time such as <strong>Louise Brooks, Clara Bow</strong>, creators like <strong>Jeanne Lanvin and Coco Chanel</strong>, but more recently television series such as the<strong> Miss Fisher, Downton Abbey</strong>, ....</p><p>I will honor my counterparts since the fundraising campaign is flexible, but I should limit my starting goals and review my priorities so that my company does not stop.</p><p>Then all my dreams will come true. And I can do so much more! I really do not lack of ideas!</p><p>Such as employing someone to help me in sewing, creating a collection of clothes and accessories even more important, making photos of my creations to include on my e-shop, organize an event on Paris gathering fans of those crazy years and art deco ... and still many other ideas that only want to be realized.</p><p><strong>A huge thank you to:</strong></p><p>Gwendoline for being a model,  Julien from Art d’Clic for his great pictures, Solyne, Morgan and her great illustrations, a beautiful source of inspiration Lorraine, my daughter Pauline, Lylou a little princess who adores my creations and last but not least my husband who believe in me ... and to all those who will allow me to continue this Great Story!</p><p> </p><p><u><i><strong>Version Française</strong></i></u></p><p><i><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506669659/izp7gtfahmgegs39gcyg.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506669693/koye1kpkit9phckxwegj.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506669724/l1x55av9fjux5xenffzl.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506669754/zrb9wpk2wjnw7ttt71xl.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></i></p><p><i><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506669782/zh1poh2myf8rbub0d2df.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></i></p><p><i><strong>UNE BELLE HISTOIRE...</strong></i></p><p>Je suis <strong>Catherine</strong>, une <strong>femme passionnée par la vie et par la création, et surtout par l’époque 1900 à 1935.</strong></p><p>Dans l’entre-deux-guerres, une génération nouvelle rêve d’un monde nouveau et proclame <strong>« Plus jamais ça ! »</strong>. Ces années, appelées les <strong>« Années Folles »</strong> ou <strong>les années 20,</strong> font jaillir une incroyable créativité dans tous les domaines : artistique, industriel, cinématographique... La mode et le design subliment le tragique de la Première Guerre Mondiale.</p><p>Cette page de l’Histoire me correspond. Cette résilience joyeuse et créatrice résonne en moi. A tel point que j’ai lancé en mars 2017 Les Créations de la Licorne pour ressusciter cet esprit.</p><p>Je chine et restaure des objets anciens : vieilles dentelles, meubles patinés, miroirs ternis, bijoux cabossés… tous ont une âme et racontent leur petite histoire dans la grande Histoire. Je crée, couds et confectionne. Bandeaux, chapeaux ou robes, plumes et perles, dentelles et broderies… je m’appuie sur mon talent créatif et l’héritage technique et artistique de<strong> ma grand-mère Louise. Couturière</strong>, elle m’a transmis sa passion, sa vision et son savoir-faire.</p><p>Aujourd’hui, je viens partager avec vous cet univers et cette inspiration joyeuse. Et j’ai besoin de vous, pour faire perdurer cette vision positive de l’histoire et du monde, et pour faire grandir mon entreprise</p><p>Aujourd’hui, je couds mes créations et restaure de vieux objets chinés sur un coin de table dans mon salon.</p><p>Je rêve d’ouvrir ma propre boutique pour y accueillir au mieux mes clients, pour exposer mes créations originales ainsi que la collection de meubles et objets de que j’ai chinés.</p><p>Ma <strong>boutique</strong> serait aussi mon <strong>atelier </strong>où je pourrais présenter les tissus, perles et plumes avec lesquels je travaille. Je pourrais coudre, broder, conseiller et former à cette époque très présente dans mon quotidien. Je pourrais réaliser des <strong>ateliers créatifs</strong> pour favoriser le travail de matières.</p><p>Pour développer mon activité, j’ai besoin de <strong>deux machines pour réaliser de la broderie Cornely</strong> pour enrichir mes créations de broderies. Métier que j’ai précédemment pratiqué et que ma mère peut toujours m’enseigner car elle était brodeuse <strong>Cornely </strong>et réalisait les 1ers modèles pour les plus grands couturiers comme<strong> Christian Lacroix</strong>.</p><p>J’ai besoin également d’une <strong>camionnette </strong>plutôt qu’une voiture pour pouvoir transporter tout mon matériel dans les différents salons et évènements auxquels je participe. J’en ai besoin aussi pour transporter les meubles que je chine pour les préparer et ensuite les livrer si besoin chez mes clients.</p><p>Petit à petit j’ai construit une clientèle qui achètent mes créations que ce soit robes de mariée, de soirée, headband et chapeaux, mais aussi les meubles que je restaure et patine. Je suis également devenue une référence en conseil de l’époque. Je réalise également des ateliers créatifs que j’espère pouvoir recevoir d’une meilleure façon dans mon atelier-boutique où en déplacement.</p><p>Récemment, une cliente m’a commandé une robe pour la montée des marches à Cannes. Un couple m’a commandé des meubles chinés pour décorer leur chambre d’hôtes. J’ai été par exemple invitée à représenter mes créations à la <strong>Convention Internationale Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries en juin 2018 aux États-Unis, à Portland dans l’Oregon</strong>.</p><p>J’ai besoin de ce financement participatif flexible pour atteindre mes différents objectifs les uns après les autres.</p><p>Créer est toute ma vie. J’aime créer tous les jours.

These years, called the «Roaring Twenties» or the 1920s, have produced incredible creativity accross the world in all fields: artistic, industrial, cinematographic ...Fashion and design underline the tragedy of the First World War.This page of History corresponds to me. This joyful and creative resilience resonates in me. So much so that I launched in March 2017 the Creations of the Unicorn to bring back this spirit.I chine and restore old objects: old lace, patinated furniture, tarnished mirrors, dented jewelry ... all have a soul and tell their little story in great history.I create, sew and make. headbands, hats or dresses, feathers and pearls, lace and embroidery ... I rely on my creative talent and the technical and artistic legacy of my grandmother Louise. Clothing designer, she passed on her passion, her vision and her know-how.Today, I come to share with you this universe and this joyful inspiration.And I need you is to continue this positive vision of history and the world, and to grow my business.Today, I sew my creations and restore old objects stuck on a corner table in my living room.I dream of opening my own shop to welcome my clients, to expose my original creations as well as the collection of furniture and objects that I have found.My shop would also be my workshop where I could present the fabrics, beads and feathers with which I work. I could sew, embroider, advise and train at this time very present in my daily life.To develop my business, I need two machines to make Cornely embroidery to enrich my embroidery creations. A profession that I have practiced previously and that my mother can always teach me because she was a Cornely embroiderer and realized the 1st models for the greatest fashion designers such as Christian Lacroix.I also need a van rather than a car to be able to transport all my equipment in the various fairs and events in which I participate in France or accross the world. I also need them to transport the furniture I make to prepare them and then deliver them if necessary to my clients.Little by little I built a clientele that buy my creations be it wedding dresses, evening dresses, headband and hats, but also the furniture that I restore in Shabby style. I also became a reference in that historical period. I also realize creative workshops with beginngers that I hope will be able to welcome in a better way in my workshop-boutique or in differents places, cities and countries.Recently, a customer ordered me a dress for climbing the stairs in Cannes. A couple ordered furniture from me to decorate their bed and breakfast.For example, I am invited to represent my creations at the International Convention Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries International Convention in June 2018 in the United States, in Portland, Oregon.I need this flexible crowdfunding to achieve my different goals step by step.Creating is all my life. I like to create every day. My grandmother gave me all her know-how as a sewing designer, her inspiration that she drew from everyday life and a very good knowledge of the years 20 -30.My creations are inspired by icons of the time such as Louise Brooks, Clara Bow, creators like Jeanne Lanvin and Coco Chanel, but more recently television series such as the Miss Fisher, Downton Abbey, ....I will honor my counterparts since the fundraising campaign is flexible, but I should limit my starting goals and review my priorities so that my company does not stop.Then all my dreams will come true. And I can do so much more! I really do not lack of ideas!Such as employing someone to help me in sewing, creating a collection of clothes and accessories even more important, making photos of my creations to include on my e-shop, organize an event on Paris gathering fans of those crazy years and art deco ... and still many other ideas that only want to be realized.A huge thank you to:Gwendoline for being a model,  Julien from Art d’Clic for his great pictures, Solyne, Morgan and her great illustrations, a beautiful source of inspiration Lorraine, my daughter Pauline, Lylou a little princess who adores my creations and last but not least my husband who believe in me ... and to all those who will allow me to continue this Great Story! Version FrançaiseUNE BELLE HISTOIRE...Je suis Catherine, une femme passionnée par la vie et par la création, et surtout par l’époque 1900 à 1935.Dans l’entre-deux-guerres, une génération nouvelle rêve d’un monde nouveau et proclame « Plus jamais ça ! ». Ces années, appelées les « Années Folles » ou les années 20, font jaillir une incroyable créativité dans tous les domaines : artistique, industriel, cinématographique... La mode et le design subliment le tragique de la Première Guerre Mondiale.Cette page de l’Histoire me correspond. Cette résilience joyeuse et créatrice résonne en moi. A tel point que j’ai lancé en mars 2017 Les Créations de la Licorne pour ressusciter cet esprit.Je chine et restaure des objets anciens : vieilles dentelles, meubles patinés, miroirs ternis, bijoux cabossés… tous ont une âme et racontent leur petite histoire dans la grande Histoire. Je crée, couds et confectionne. Bandeaux, chapeaux ou robes, plumes et perles, dentelles et broderies… je m’appuie sur mon talent créatif et l’héritage technique et artistique de ma grand-mère Louise. Couturière, elle m’a transmis sa passion, sa vision et son savoir-faire.Aujourd’hui, je viens partager avec vous cet univers et cette inspiration joyeuse. Et j’ai besoin de vous, pour faire perdurer cette vision positive de l’histoire et du monde, et pour faire grandir mon entrepriseAujourd’hui, je couds mes créations et restaure de vieux objets chinés sur un coin de table dans mon salon.Je rêve d’ouvrir ma propre boutique pour y accueillir au mieux mes clients, pour exposer mes créations originales ainsi que la collection de meubles et objets de que j’ai chinés.Ma boutique serait aussi mon atelier où je pourrais présenter les tissus, perles et plumes avec lesquels je travaille. Je pourrais coudre, broder, conseiller et former à cette époque très présente dans mon quotidien. Je pourrais réaliser des ateliers créatifs pour favoriser le travail de matières.Pour développer mon activité, j’ai besoin de deux machines pour réaliser de la broderie Cornely pour enrichir mes créations de broderies. Métier que j’ai précédemment pratiqué et que ma mère peut toujours m’enseigner car elle était brodeuse Cornely et réalisait les 1ers modèles pour les plus grands couturiers comme Christian Lacroix.J’ai besoin également d’une camionnette plutôt qu’une voiture pour pouvoir transporter tout mon matériel dans les différents salons et évènements auxquels je participe. J’en ai besoin aussi pour transporter les meubles que je chine pour les préparer et ensuite les livrer si besoin chez mes clients.Petit à petit j’ai construit une clientèle qui achètent mes créations que ce soit robes de mariée, de soirée, headband et chapeaux, mais aussi les meubles que je restaure et patine. Je suis également devenue une référence en conseil de l’époque. Je réalise également des ateliers créatifs que j’espère pouvoir recevoir d’une meilleure façon dans mon atelier-boutique où en déplacement.Récemment, une cliente m’a commandé une robe pour la montée des marches à Cannes. Un couple m’a commandé des meubles chinés pour décorer leur chambre d’hôtes. J’ai été par exemple invitée à représenter mes créations à la Convention Internationale Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries en juin 2018 aux États-Unis, à Portland dans l’Oregon.J’ai besoin de ce financement participatif flexible pour atteindre mes différents objectifs les uns après les autres.Créer est toute ma vie. J’aime créer tous les jours. Ma grand-mère m’a transmis tout son savoir-faire de couturière, son inspiration qu’elle tirait du quotidien et une très bonne connaissance des années 20-années 30.Mes créations s’inspirent des icônes de l’époque comme Louise Brooks, Clara Bow, des créatrices comme Jeanne Lanvin et Coco Chanel, mais aussi plus récemment les séries télévisées comme les Enquêtes de Miss Fisher, Downton Abbey,.. .J’honorerai mes contreparties puisque la campagne de financement est flexible, mais je devrais limiter mes objectifs de départ et revoir mes priorités pour ne pas que ma société s’arrête.Alors tous mes rêves deviendront réalité. Et je pourrai faire tellement plus! Je ne manque vraiment pas d’idées !

</h3><div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We urgently need funds in the amount of $6,000 to ensure that the children have a roof over their head. The $300 is included to pay Indiegogo their 5% fee for using the platform.<br/></p>
<p>We are currently in the process of being evicted as no funds have been forthcoming from our fundraising initiatives. Securing funds for RENT and basic necessities, is an uphill battle. One that is slowly taking it's toll on both the children and their 
caregivers. <br/></p>
<p>This is the seventh time in the space of ten years, that we have to move. We do not have the funds to move and cannot afford a more expensive house to rent. This place we live in is the cheapest we could find. The children have not known the joy of a permanent home, as there's always been the ever nagging thought in the back of their minds: ""How long before we have to move again"".</p>
<p>By helping us raise $6,000 you will help us pay outstanding rent money which we owe the landlord from the beginning of this year till now, as well as ensure that our rent is paid for till the end of this year.</p>
<p>By helping us raise this money you will ensure that the children would not have to go through the traumatic experience of having to move yet again, leaving friends and familiar surroundings behind.</p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Ask &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here is a breakdown of what the money will be used for:</p>
<p>We currently pay N$8,000 a month for rent. <br/></p>
<p>This would amount to N$ 96,000 per year for rent. <br/></p>
<p>We've paid only N$ 18,000 for the year, <br/></p>
<p>Which leaves N$ 78,000 outstanding for the year.<br/></p>
<p>At the current exchange rate of roughly N$13 : 1USD we would be able to pay this amount and ensure that the children have a peaceful festive season.</p>
<p><b>This amounts to exactly $6,000</b><br/></p>
<p>Should we not reach our goal with this campaign, we will use all monies collected in the payment of the outstanding rent amount.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What we can offer you for your help <br/></b></p>
<p>For donations of $25 - We will send you a handwritten personalized letter from the children as well as a photo to thank you for your donation.</p>
<p>For donations of $100 - We will send you an engraved makalani nut keyholder. The makalani nut grows only in the northern parts of Namibia.</p>

<p>This home is not run by an organization but by two women who depend on the kindness of others.</p>
<p><b>Running the home costs about $16,000 a year</b>. This includes rent, food, water and electricity and other basic expenses, but excludes things like clothing, homeschooling necessities and fees for extracurricular activities for all 9 children.</p>
<p>Here is a basic layout:</p>

<p>Subtotal       USD  (exchange rate of 13 to the dollar)            $1,350 /month     <b><br/></b></p>
<p>an extra $400 /month would help cover for things like fuel, car maintenance, medicine, clothing, extracurricular activities like extra lessons, fun outings, school excursions, school necessities and cosmetics.  Which would bring the total monthly expenditures to:<b><br/></b></p>

A big chunk of the money goes towards rent, and we would like to eliminate that. Our immediate future goals include coming back to this platform as soon as possible to raise funds for the acquisition of a piece of land. <br/>We are currently looking at a smallholding outside of Swakopmund, as it is big enough to build a big house, as well as plant crops and keep animals.

Malaria is the number one killer of children in Africa. Over half a million children under the age of 5 die from Malaria every year; that’s one child dying every 60 seconds. 
Our End Malaria Now team will be going to Africa in February 2016 to hand deliver 10,000 mosquito bed nets to the villages in immediate need, educate them on the prevention of malaria and to demonstrate the proper use of these bed nets.



End Malaria Now has distributed over 50,000 bed nets since 2009, please help us distribute 10,000 MORE this February 2016!!! 


A race to save as many lives as we can is happening now and we must ACT FAST! A simple mosquito bed net has the ability to help prevent the transmission of malaria and thus SAVE LIVES!!! 




While the goal to get us closer to the malaria-free world we dream of is high, the price of inaction is even higher. 
Please support our cause and help make ending malaria deaths our generation’s greatest humanitarian triumph!

We at The Typewriter hope to address two main problems facing news
media and social media today.

First problem: Misrepresentation
Simply put, we ask these questions: 


In this day and age of the 24-hour international news cycle, what gives an
American, British or Australian journalist the expertise to report on what’s
actually happening on the ground in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, or vice
versa? 
What is the point of news media if their method of portrayal is solely
tailored to tell a story which fits the tastes, style and rhetoric of a home
audience thousands of miles away?


We notice that there is a substantive disconnect between what is happening
in certain countries, what is being said by those who live in these countries,
and what is being reported by international news media. 
Eventually,
misrepresentation will lead to a decline of confidence in the news at large. People
will stop reading and those who are being misrepresented will stop caring.
Second problem: Sensationalism
In recent years, as the internet is
being ‘democratised’, anonymity and the chase for high click engagements
have fuelled more articles, comments, posts or tweets which are catchy, trendy,
controversial or offensive. The internet nowadays lack a decorum of respect
and reserve. 
As a result, publishers try their best in being ‘trendy’ by
tailoring their articles to the lowest common denominator of humanity.
Eventually, many moderate readers become fed up with the media in
general, due to the presence of loud, tasteless and nonsensical content.

We are not trying to filter or censor content or opinion. We believe that everyone deserves a voice and everyone should be given a platform to express their concerns. However, we also believe that opinions will be better understood if the tone, manner, language and delivery of the ideas are less sensationalist in general.

Our mission: Reverse these trends

We believe that the best way to do so is to invite and empower those who
are on the ground to tell their own stories themselves. As such, The
Typewriter provides a media platform for anyone to write an article via our
website or our mirroring mobile app.

In order to publish quality content whilst empowering those who are not
confident in writing eloquently, we have an internal editing system which
connects writers and editors. 
They can track the changes made to an article
and they can work with each other so that the writers’ words will not be
misread or misunderstood. With the editorial support provided by our
dedicated team of editors, we reduce misrepresentation and sensationalism
in the media. Just like an actual typewriter, we become a tool to encourage
better communication between individuals and across cultures.  

Awards and Recognition
United Nations: 
We've been recognised as a youth organisation and we have been regularly invited to attend meetings on the Youth. 
Interviews:
Our brand and our principles have given us the credibility to reach out to public figures. Our most recent interviews include a former Foreign Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a former Australian Prime Minister, a former British Member of Parliament, a Partner of KPMG and award winning film directors. 


PITCH Competition:
At this year's RISE Conference (a tech x startup conference in Hong Kong), The Typewriter entered the PITCH competition and ended up a Semi-Finalist after competing with over 300 companies. 







E-Squared Competition:

At this year's Hong Kong IT Fest, The Typewriter entered the E-squared Competition and won the Most Popular Pitch Award for Social innovation x Tech Innovation. 

Mentions in the Press: 
Our efforts are mentioned in an array of independent media sites, noting our effort in reaching out to a smarter audience by providing articles which are only written by those who are on the ground. Latest interviews of The Typewriter are found in StartUp Daily and Periodismoncidadano (Spanish Citizen Journalism)

student, our readership and the number of our writers have grown steadily.
Currently, we have over 5 million unique visitors from all around the world, with a monthly average view rate of 800,000.
Most of them are university students, graduates or young professionals.
General feedback we have received so far from our readers are quite
positive, stressing the need for quality and genuine content in the world and
that not everyone wants to read easy click-bait oriented content. 
		
	
	
		





Moreover, our website is currently in four languages (English, Chinese,
French and German) and we will be branching out to Spanish and Arabic
later this year. We realised that in order to maximise our readership and to
foster a stronger community in global communications and media, we
simply cannot only pay attention to English speakers. From now on,
whenever a person writes an article in his/her mother tongue, it will be
cross-translated by our affiliate language teams.




Our Goals


Making the world a better place


A more civilised news media 


Encouraging REAL communication 


Promote REAL global citizenship 





It is common knowledge that it is often most difficult to start an independent news media channels. People would say that there is no way you can compete with the established media. 
So that is why we need your help. We believe that, considering our growing support and readership, we can survive and we will make the world more civilised. But we need your support as well. The funds raised will be used to look for aspiring young talents in all corners of the world and start reporting what's happening on the ground. We will use our funds wisely to fund our editors, artists and photographers who are working voluntarily. 
Our long-term plan is to have multiple languages on our site, an online channel, a quicker editing system and coverage everywhere. This will need substantial funds to find talents, fund equipments and work with local organisations.",7.0,3,"1 Campaign

cannot handle. We eat challenges for breakfast, lunch dinner. If
there is not a challenge in front of us, something is wrong and too quiet so it
is a time to pause and listen.  Every day is about jumping hurdles and
moving forward. We grow stronger because of our proven ability to run
through challenges day in and day out. We balance family, work, spirit,
and exercise to an Art. Everything is challenging, it just depends on how
you are mentally and physically prepared to face life's ups and downs.  </p>

jogs two to three times a week.  He also has two young boys who run more
than wild gazelles.</p>

I specialize in developing Internet websites, apps and businesses to support and serve the US Military veterans and their families of this great country. I am the CEO and I lead a tremendous force of co-founders, staff, contractors, family members, and partners from around the world. It is a privilege to serve veterans in their struggles to recover from the war’s wounds.This campaign is about putting a STOP to Veteran struggles by 
empowering them to network with each other better, to serve each other 
better, and to use the Military camaraderie that they love to find 
better paths as civilians in America.What is 'ServingVETS'?
ServingVETS gives
veterans a support platform based on peer recommendations of local resources.
The platform is currently deployed on the web as well as the Apple iTunes
market. Find us at www.servingvets.com.  @servingvets #veterans  ServingVETS 2.0:  The money raised will go to develop and market this platform.With the money raised
 through this campaign we will be able to build a new ServingVETS 2.0 
with new and improved features, get the platform out to the world, and
extend the reach to all Android, Windows 10, and Amazon devices (as well
 iOS and the web which we have already accomplished with the first 
version of the platform). SV 2.0 enables:1. View member reviews and their activity updates2. Add photos, videos, emojis and drawings3. Use on both tablets and mobile devices4. Advanced privacy controls and security settings5. Ability to see another veterans location if enabledWatch the below video to see Jonathon and his son encourage press and the media to contact us about ServingVETS and veteran support in general.What is 'ServingVETS' - Learn More....
ServingVETS
verifies, connects, and matches veterans together based on their unique profile
traits and their unique privacy settings. It is free for anyone to use to read
ratings/reviews from verified veterans, however only US Military veterans are
allowed to create an account and post ratings/reviews. Through veteran
verification we are creating a platform of trusted online resources supporting
US veterans and their families across the world.  
Veterans will be
able to set their privacy for a unique radar that only other Veterans could use.
All information and documentation will also be stored in a very secure way so
that Veterans in need can open up in a non-intimidating space. This would be an
online space only available to other veterans, making it a safe and supportive
platform to use.
Our vision is to let
the veteran closely control the privacy of their posts and enable them to send
posts to groups of veterans they create (in a similar way to Google circles). Then,
a veteran can organize their followers into categories based on trust and
privacy.Press Release and Press Mentions:ServingVETS has an official press release, the link is here - http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dc-area-internet-entrepreneur-launches-servingvets-an-exclusive-and-secure-social-network-for-veterans-300176730.html We were picked up in Tech.co, which is what Tech Cocktail used to be.Tech.co official link - http://tech.co/servingvets-launches-crowdfunding-campaign-expands-features-2015-11 Who Runs 'ServingVETS'?
The amazing team bringing you ServingVETS is run by seasoned
CEO and proven startup leader, Jonathon Lunardi. This campaign is critical because America's veterans
need help and they are all connected by their phones, tablets, and other devices. There are too many suicides each day, too many homeless, so many confused,
and waiting in long lines for far too long.  The ServingVETS team is made up of doers who use technology to empower a veteran grassroots movement to support veteran care of the future.

DC for 15 years. He grew up in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and went to the University of

or Facebook for Veterans, focused on connecting Veterans together to solve
their problems and recover faster from their wounds than ever before.
We are America, we are inventors, we are pioneers, we are
entrepreneurs who develop innovations to solve any problem, no matter how
daunting.  ServingVETS is aimed at doing that for the many diverse
problems and pain that is caused from being a part of the longest war in
history of America, Iraq and Afghanistan.  
America is one of the greatest nations on the planet because
of the US Military protecting its freedom, pursuit of liberty, and justice for
all people.  By backing this project or sharing the campaign with others,
you are Serving US Military Veterans.Be a part of the solution, help fund our project, and
support ServingVETS.com today!Overcoming ChallengesFirst off, there is no challenge that Jonathon and his team
cannot handle. We eat challenges for breakfast, lunch dinner. If
there is not a challenge in front of us, something is wrong and too quiet so it
is a time to pause and listen.  Every day is about jumping hurdles and
moving forward. We grow stronger because of our proven ability to run
through challenges day in and day out. We balance family, work, spirit,
and exercise to an Art. Everything is challenging, it just depends on how
you are mentally and physically prepared to face life's ups and downs.  
Jonathon plays Ultimate Frisbee at least once a week and
jogs two to three times a week.  He also has two young boys who run more
than wild gazelles.

<li>I am a current University of Illinois Masters student in the Recreation, Sport and Tourism department.

<ul>
<li>We started with the bare minimums. For those of you who visited our store in the first few weeks you will remember our 3 sleeves of Magic singles and one sleeve of YuGiOh singles.

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Golden Glow Games is a great community space, where all ages and experience levels have been able to interact, learn and have fun. We have taught many how to play games they had not heard of before, and have made many new friends. Tabletop gaming is my passion, from RPG's to trading card games, to board games, I love the personal interaction that these strategy games bring.  The goal is to reach more of the community and bring more of the gamers looking for a personal connection to our store.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I took a huge risk opening this store with minimal capital. With the support of a few wonderful people and a lot of hard work from myself and my family we got this business off and running. All businesses take time to grow and throw challenges at you. I am excited to face these. I can't wait to see what the next six months send our way. Hopefully more new friends and fun times.</p>

Hi!  We are Jreh & Christine Hurst, late-bloomer small business owners.  We are longtime residents of Park Slope, Brooklyn. We've been married 10 years and have a 6 year old son, Julian.
Born in Park Slope, Jreh became a Certified Personal Trainer at the age of 37 and Christine became a Certified Health Coach shortly thereafter.
We both arrived at our present passions due to personal experience with weight loss and are committed to helping others recognize their health potential within the community we know and love. You can say that we are, “all in”!
For our full background, here is a link to BKLYNER, a local blog that featured us on their site.
We've always wanted to own our own business and decided to pursue our dream in 2017 when we opened the physical location of, BK Fitness Center.
In 2016, Jreh secured a large, raw, industrial storefront at the intersection of three up-and-coming Brooklyn neighborhoods: South Slope, Greenwood and Gowanus. 
Jreh worked fast to design the gym layout, procure equipment and build out the space. Most of our cash was spent on equipment, tools and rent deposits.
Our first eight months have been a whirlwind of learning, growing, hard work and hustle. We work day and night at our gym. We both clean toilets, stock towels and check people in. No job is too small. Jreh does all the training/coaching as well as teaches classes while I work behind the scenes doing marketing and health coaching while maintaining a full time job that pays our house bills. 
We LOVE the business we have worked so hard to build and are blown away by the support we have received from the neighborhood. We are so thankful when someone chooses to spend their hard-earned money to join our gym. That reason alone is why we dedicate so much of ourselves in investing in our member's health and fitness. We WANT our members to come and get healthy and fit.  It also means the world to us to have the opportunity of running our business within the community we live.

Help the Temple Institute Raise a Red Heifer

Help the Temple Institute produce a kosher Red Heifer in the Land of Israel. Be part of restoring the state of purity that will enable the rebuilding of the Holy Temple.

After millennia of yearning, only one organization is paving the way for the rebuilding of the Holy Temple. The Temple Institute, (מכון המקדש) located in the Old City of Jerusalem, is a research organization dedicated to preparing for the construction of the Third Temple, including the recreation of over 60 sacred Temple vessels ready for use once the Temple is rebuilt. These include the High Priest's breastplate featuring the twelve precious stones of the tribes of Israel, the half-ton golden menorah, and the musical instruments of the Levitical choir. Last year, the Temple Institute's successful Indiegogo campaign raised over $100,000 used to develop architectural plans for the Holy Temple.August 2015: Last year's bold campaign to raise $100,000 for the preparations of architectural plans for the Third Temple was a great success, thanks to the hundreds of people who supported the effort. This past Tisha b'Av (July 26, 2015) we released a short video showing for the first time detailed architectural plans and 3D renditions of the Holy Temple Sanctuary.


The Holy Temple stands for the sanctity and dignity of human life and universal peace, and will be the center of an inspiring pilgrimage for all people (see Isaiah Ch. 2). 



The Temple Institute is now beginning one of its most ambitious projects to date: Restoring the Divine commandment of the Red Heifer, enabling the return of tahara, the state of Biblical purity to the world. This is an integral part of the prophesied promise of the elevation and unity of all humanity. 


What is a Red Heifer? Why Do We Need One? 


""And they shall take to you a perfect red heifer..."" - Numbers 19
The Red Heifer is a female cow, three years of age, with perfect consistency of a particular reddish hue, having not even two hairs of any other color. The heifer also may never be used for any type of labor, and must be totally blemish-free.  The ordinance of the para aduma, the Red Heifer, is found in the Torah, in the book of Numbers Chapter 19, and elucidated in the teachings of the Sages of Israel. The process of purification through the Red Heifer is the only antidote to the state of impurity caused by death, and thus, intrinsically imperative for the reestablishment of purity. 
What's the Difference Between an Ordinary Red Cow, and a Proper Red Heifer?
Red cattle can be found throughout the world, and are not uncommon. However, raising a perfect red heifer in accordance with Biblical requirements for the fulfillment of the Numbers Ch. 19 commandment is a daunting task requiring advance planning, exacting preparation and constant supervision. In order for a heifer to be considered kosher for the Biblical use, it must literally be raised from birth under specific circumstances and in a controlled environment. 
The Project Has Begun: A Change in Conception

In the past the people of Israel waited for the birth of a potential Red Heifer. But with Torah knowledge and advanced science, the Temple Institute has now begun to actively pursue this commandment.  For this unprecedented project, the Temple Institute has joined forces with experienced cattle ranchers here in Israel. These experts in the science of animal husbandry, under the halachic  supervision and guidance of the rabbis of the Temple Institute, will utilize the technique of implanting the frozen embryos of Red Angus cattle in Israeli domestic cattle.  The end result of this program will be the introduction of the Red Angus breed into Israel. This method, authorized and approved by Israel's Ministry of Agriculture, has already proven successful with the birth of a number of male Red Angus. The location and other details of the cattle ranch will remain undisclosed to the general public during the initial stages of the project. The Temple Institute will release periodic progress updates.

Our Immediate Goal is $125,000. Your contribution will go towards:



embryo implantation 


veterinary care, upkeep, and feed

special supervised arrangements for care in accordance with Biblical law

infrastructure for the controlled environment of the herd

identification and separate care of candidates for perfect Red Heifers

security arrangements including 24 hour video surveillance and monitoring 

the publication of original, ground-breaking halachic research and findings 

The successful introduction of perfect Red Heifers to Israel is the first project of a multi-level program that will span a number of years. Future stages of the purity restoration program will include:  



Expansion of the curriculum and faculty of the Temple Institute's acclaimed Nezer HaKodesh Academy for Priestly Studies to include the training of prospective priests-in-training in all aspects of the precept of the Red Heifer;


The identification and selection of kohanim (descendants of the priestly tribe of Aaron) whose state of purity enables them to attend to the preparation of the Red Heifer;


 the documentation and provision of the precise location on the Mount of Olives for the heifer's preparation 



Myths and Facts



Myths:

The appearance of a Red Heifer is miraculous
The Red Heifer will be prepared by  the Messiah
A Red Heifer cannot be prepared without first obtaining the ashes of the original Red Heifer 


Facts: 



There is nothing miraculous about the birth of a red cow; they exist in plenty. But raising and preparing a heifer to be a potential candidate for fulfilling the Biblical commandment requires know-how:  halachic, scientific and animal husbandry expertise,  The Temple Institute's partnership with expert Israeli cattlemen represents the perfect synthesis of Torah knowledge and scientific expertise... and faith. A true religious-Zionist enterprise! 


In the words of the great sage, Maimonides, there is no halachic connection between the arrival of the Messiah, and our obligation to fulfill any of G-d's commandments (Rambam, Iggeret HaShmad). All of the Torah's commandments are doable and waiting to be fulfilled; the Red Heifer is no different.
There is no halachic prerequisite that requires the original ashes

<p><b>The Deep South Biscuit Co</b>. is a new Food Truck business in the metropolitan Atlanta area.  The brainchild of Giovanna Rosenfeld and Kara Hornbuckle - We are hoping to fill a void in the Food Truck community of Atlanta by adding a new twist to the concept of comfort food and developed a delicious and exciting menu featuring our Gourmet from Scratch Buttermilk Biscuits. Our goal is To provide the Atlanta area with Gourmet Southern Biscuit Sandwiches, southern sides and of course some homemade sweet tea and lemonade. We have been working on a food truck for over three years and believe we know what it takes to make The Deep South Biscuit Company Truck - the best one in Atlanta!  If you like a delicious comforting biscuit with lots of down home ingredients, then this will satisfy your cravings for something out of the ordinary. </p>
<p><b>Our Plan: </b>is to use the funds that we hope to raise through a successful Kickstarter campaign to get our business operational... we have already borrowed some money from a friend to buy the truck (Thank you RF)- but really need a little extra help.  We want to raise at least $5,000 with this kickstarter to help ""beautify"" the truck - Wraps can be as much as $7500 - we have found an artist that will paint the truck for a fraction of that, in addition we need to install a new serving window which is about $2500. Then we need to get permitted - The entire process will be a minimum of $15,000.  As an added incentive to get the community to help exceed our goal, we plan to make one of our customers’ dreams come true if we exceed our goal by $10,000 and bring a ""pop up"" to one of our backers at work (they can treat their office by their own generosity)  We feel that our wishes are coming true and we would like to do the same for others and our community. Kickstarter can allow us to do that, and get our truck up and running sooner. We have used most of our personal money for the truck and equipment. We have signed a lease on a commercial prep kitchen space and have outfit it with all of the necessary kitchen equipment. We need to pay permit and license fees, and purchase three months of supplies. We will launch our weekday business working in the newly designated area set aside exclusively for food trucks in the heart of downtown Atlanta and hopefully the adjacent suburbs (From Swanee - to Kennesaw). On the weekends we will take advantage of our mobility and will be taking our truck to many of the community's festivals and special events. In addition, we are offering catering services - office parks, weddings, bat-mitzvahs!  We hope to begin serving in March of 2016,</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>If we have help, we can make this happen - make dreams come true and feed the streets - literally and figuratively.  We plan to use profits to help others in our industry.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The concept of food trucks has been around for a long time, but here is where we meet the challenge in the Atlanta marketplace.

<p>My name is Joel Isenberg, I am the Owner and Toy Reviewer at
Ryndur’d Reviews and I am opening my own Comic Book and Toy store called – From
Hobbies to Heroes.</p>
<p>From Hobbies to Heroes will focus on Comic Books from
Marvel, DC Comics, Image, IDW Publishing and more, as well as Action Figures
and Collectables from all genre. We want to celebrate all things Geek, and we
want to do it with YOU!  </p>
<p><b>How can you help From Hobbies to Heroes open their doors?</b><br/>
We are seeing contributions and funds to help open our doors.  Currently we are looking at about $20,000 to
fully realize this goal to ensure we get our best foot forward.  Every bit of the funds raised will go to the
growth and set up of From Hobbies to Heroes. 
The money raised will go to the purchase of the following;</p>
<p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>Inventory – The more inventory we can have on
hand when we open the better we can serve our customers with their collecting
needs. </p>
<p><span>a.<span> 
</span></span>By using Diamond Comics as our distributor we
can get the latest comics from all the major distributors.  The minimum monthly requirements for
purchasing from Diamond is approximately $500 per month.  We expect to pay a little more than this to
help increase or initial stock for the first year.</p>
<p><span>b.<span> 
</span></span>We also intend to purchase figures and
collectables from Entertainment Earth, Hobby Link Japan, Bluefin Distributions
and other stores to help provide a wide range of stock from Transformers, Star
Wars, Power Rangers, Kamen Rider, S.H. Figuarts and Figma.</p>
<p><span>c.<span> 
</span></span>Other Items we intend to stock include Trading
Card Games, like Pokemon, Magic the Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh! We also intend to
carry Wall Scrolls, Posters, Board Games and miniature figures.</p>
<p><span>2.<span> 
</span></span>Equipment – In order to prepare and hold the
inventory we will have on stock we will need the necessary equipment to process
the orders and make sure we keep items in the best possible shape for our
customer, as well as the most accurate inventory. Some of the items include;</p>
<p><span>a.<span> 
</span></span>Shelving – the shelves we are looking at for our
inventory are approximately $220.00, we are looking to help house or inventory
of Comics and items that will not be stored at Fulfilment by Amazon.</p>
<p><span>b.<span> 
</span></span>Workbench – 
$225.00</p>
<p><span>c.<span> 
</span></span>Heat Gun and Shrinkwrap Supplies – $150.00</p>
<p><span>d.<span> 
</span></span>Boxes and Shipping Supplies</p>
<p><span>e.<span> 
</span></span>Laser Printer - $150.00</p>
<p><span>f.<span> 
</span></span>Computer for the Store – necessary to keep
inventory, placing orders, business records, etc. </p>
<p><span>g.<span> 
</span></span>Hand Scanner - $60.00</p>
<p><span>3.<span> 
</span></span>Storage – A lot of items will be sent to Amazon
for order fulfilment, but we intend to keep items on hand as well for local
sales.  Currently to rent the appropriate
sized, climate controlled environment we are projecting a cost of $2,160.00 a
year.</p>
<p><span>4.<span> 
</span></span>Advertisement – Getting the word out will help
us attract more customers.  This includes
paid advertisement on Facebook, Twitter and media outlets. We also expect to have Business cards to hand
out to the general public, at Conventions and other gatherings.</p>
<p><span>5.<span> 
</span></span>Business related fees – While we are currently a
Sole Proprietorship business we intent to set up a Limited Liability
Corporation for our business.  </p>

reading was kindled by comic books.  Imagination
starts with a healthy love of playing, be it with legos, Transformers, Star Wars

skies of Gallifry? Stared down the Armies of Rita Repulsa or Lord Zedd? Have you ever wanted to know the secrets of
Protoculture, or become the Songstress of the Universe?  Have you ever wanted to make the Kessel run
in under 12 Parsecs?  Well, I have and it’s
awesome!
My name is Joel Isenberg, I am the Owner and Toy Reviewer at
Ryndur’d Reviews and I am opening my own Comic Book and Toy store called – From
Hobbies to Heroes.
From Hobbies to Heroes will focus on Comic Books from
Marvel, DC Comics, Image, IDW Publishing and more, as well as Action Figures
and Collectables from all genre. We want to celebrate all things Geek, and we
want to do it with YOU!  
How can you help From Hobbies to Heroes open their doors?
We are seeing contributions and funds to help open our doors.  Currently we are looking at about $20,000 to
fully realize this goal to ensure we get our best foot forward.  Every bit of the funds raised will go to the
growth and set up of From Hobbies to Heroes. 
The money raised will go to the purchase of the following;
1. 
Inventory – The more inventory we can have on
hand when we open the better we can serve our customers with their collecting
needs. 
a. 
By using Diamond Comics as our distributor we
can get the latest comics from all the major distributors.  The minimum monthly requirements for
purchasing from Diamond is approximately $500 per month.  We expect to pay a little more than this to
help increase or initial stock for the first year.
b. 
We also intend to purchase figures and
collectables from Entertainment Earth, Hobby Link Japan, Bluefin Distributions
and other stores to help provide a wide range of stock from Transformers, Star
Wars, Power Rangers, Kamen Rider, S.H. Figuarts and Figma.
c. 
Other Items we intend to stock include Trading
Card Games, like Pokemon, Magic the Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh! We also intend to
carry Wall Scrolls, Posters, Board Games and miniature figures.
2. 
Equipment – In order to prepare and hold the
inventory we will have on stock we will need the necessary equipment to process
the orders and make sure we keep items in the best possible shape for our
customer, as well as the most accurate inventory. Some of the items include;
a. 
Shelving – the shelves we are looking at for our
inventory are approximately $220.00, we are looking to help house or inventory
of Comics and items that will not be stored at Fulfilment by Amazon.
b. 
Workbench – 
$225.00
c. 
Heat Gun and Shrinkwrap Supplies – $150.00

inventory, placing orders, business records, etc. 
g.

3. 
Storage – A lot of items will be sent to Amazon
for order fulfilment, but we intend to keep items on hand as well for local
sales.  Currently to rent the appropriate
sized, climate controlled environment we are projecting a cost of $2,160.00 a
year.
4. 
Advertisement – Getting the word out will help
us attract more customers.  This includes
paid advertisement on Facebook, Twitter and media outlets. We also expect to have Business cards to hand
out to the general public, at Conventions and other gatherings.
5. 
Business related fees – While we are currently a
Sole Proprietorship business we intent to set up a Limited Liability
Corporation for our business.
