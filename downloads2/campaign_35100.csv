<p class=""Body1"">Since 1994, Vanguard Community Development Corporation is one of the many organizations affecting change in the city of Detroit. The organization was founded by Bishop Edgar Vann, II, to facilitate the revitalization of the physical, social, and economic fabric of The North End neighborhood. In the 19 years of dedicated service in the neighborhood, we have been able to serve nearly 100,000 families and their children and have invested over $60 million to build affordable housing. </p>
<p>Footprints to Prosperity is designed to service home-based providers and caregivers of children from birth to age 5 in our community who want to learn more about how children learn best. We offer these individuals, (who could be single mothers or fathers, grandparents, aunts or uncles, cousins, etc.) free resources as well as additional support and evaluation tools to ensure milestones are reached. Our goal with this program is to produce children who are Kindergarten ready!</p>
<p><strong>The Barriers We Face</strong></p>
<p>Many times, the work needed in Detroit can be accomplished with very little or even no money. But sometimes, in order to make a large impact, there is a cost. This is especially true when it comes to educating our children. We all know what happens when budgets are cut and programming is lost. But did you know that the most formative years of a child’s education begins before they are of kindergarten age? And that getting them started on the right path by age 3 will greatly reduce potential setbacks in the future? According to a 2012 report prepared by The Skillman Foundation and Data Driven Detroit, parents of Detroit children under the age of 5 years old, of which 62.7% live below the poverty line, have too few options available for high quality care for their children. The same report estimates there are only 301 childcare centers in Detroit to serve approximately 50,000 children under the age of 5 years old. The lack of options, coupled with affordability and transportation concerns, usually means most children are care for by family members or other providers in an unregulated home-based setting. Here are some additional statistics that demonstrate more barriers we are trying to overcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>While 90% of brain development occurs by age 3, children who are not in quality child care are not as likely to receive early learning experiences that foster brain development</li>
<li>Children that live in poverty are exposed to 40,000 less words that children that come from middle class backgrounds</li>
<li>80% of all births in Detroit are to single women</li>
<li>34% of all births in Detroit are to women without a high school diploma or GED</li>
<li>In 2011 45,000 children in the city of Detroit received child care subsidy assistance for early childhood needs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>The United Way of SE Michigan has committed $175,000 which needs to be matched EVERY YEAR. We have been able to secure a large portion the match for this year, but we are not quite there yet. This campaign is to raise $25k and we are choosing to opt for the flexible campaign because even if we don’t make the goal (or if exceed it), we will still be able to use the money to:</p>
<ul>
<li>set up early learning hubs with books, toys and create healthy play spaces</li>
<li>make resources and educational training materials available to home-based providers to improve professional development</li>
<li>provide incentives for parents and providers for participating in the program.</li>
<li>Control and develop and implement a rigorous evaluation tool to ensure the program is successful</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is YOUR chance to affect significant change in the life of a child in Detroit. </strong></p>
<p>By donating even just $3 to this campaign, you can help more children in our community meet important educational milestones. Did you know that by age 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>A baby's brain has reached almost 90 percent of its adult size.</li>
<li>A child have a vocabulary of over 1000 words.</li>
<li>A toddler stay engaged in one activity for 8-9 minutes.</li>

<p>The courteous Dunkin’ Donuts employee who endured the unhinged rantings of that crazy female customer is an 18-year-old who just graduated from a Florida high school and earns around $8 an hour serving Coolattas and Munchkins to patrons at the Fort Lauderdale eatery.</p>
<p>In a TSG interview, Abid Adar said that he and another employee were the only ones working at the North Federal Highway store Friday night when Taylor Chapman, 27, and her friends placed an order at the drive-thru window.</p>
<p>After Adar’s coworker was slow to provide Chapman with a receipt, she argued that her group’s food should be free, per a store policy that guarantees a customer’s order will be comped if they are not given a receipt.</p>
<p>Adar’s coworker Nithi--who was manning the drive-thru window--explained to Chapman that she would have to speak with a manager the next day about the refund request. Chapman returned to Dunkin’ Donuts the following morning ready to precipitate a confrontation, which she subsequently filmed with her iPhone.</p>
<p>As seen on the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLcg6fqcJhg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a>, Adar remains polite and composed in the face of Chapman’s unrelenting boorishness. “I’ll give you your order free. Whatever you ordered yesterday I can give it to you for free,” he tells Chapman. “Whatever you want, I’ll get it for you.”</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.cdn.turner.com/dr/teg/tsg/release/sites/default/files/assets/abid2.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px;""/></p>
<p>The teenager (pictured in the above screen grab) never responds in kind to Chapman’s vulgarities or provocations. “I’m very sorry about that,” he replied when she complained about her purported mistreatment at the Dunkin’ Donuts, which is about 2.5 miles from the Oakland Park apartment Chapman shares with her boyfriend. Asked about his cool demeanor, Adar said, “We were just trying to be nice.”</p>
<p>For her part, Chapman spewed a steady stream of insults and inanities. She called Nithi a “complete cunt sand nigger whore” while also remarking, “I just want my bacon crispy and my people to be nice.”</p>
<p>Adar told TSG that while he was aware of the video Chapman shot--and later posted online--he had not viewed it. He learned of the video’s existence when a former coworker of Chapman’s (who had seen the video on her Facebook page) called Dunkin’ Donuts and ""apologized for her behavior.”</p>
<p>The teenager, who said he had never encountered a customer as belligerent as Chapman, began frequenting Dunkin’ Donuts about three years ago, when he would help out his mother, who worked at the eatery. In the fall, Adar--who wants to be a doctor--begins attending Florida Atlantic University in Fort Lauderdale.</p>

<p>I Do not know Abid Adar personally, yet his courteous demeanor and polite attitute during the course of the situation that made him a ""viral sensation"" made an impact on the way I think about situations like this, and made me challenge myself to take action and not let it pass by or simply promt me to give a ""like"" on my facebook page.</p>
<p>As I watched the video for the 3rd time, and counting the grossly amount of bad words used by that woman in her rant, it only occur to me that no one, under no circumstance should be addressed in the way she did, to Abid and his co-worker. Her words filled with an unfounded hatred and misrepresented logic made me wonder if her retoric was the result of a momentary hate-the-world episode or simply the use of some illegal drug early in the morning.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, instead of focusing on the bad and perpetuating the silent violence, lack of tolerance and self-entitlement of some humans, like the counterpart in the video in question, it was time to do something different and act on it , and the best way to reward Abid's attitute and composture is trying to give him a hand to make his wish of becoming a doctor a reality, and give a lesson to those who think is right to treat others with disrespect, just for the color of their skin or their heritage.</p>
<p>After fighting with my own concience and schedule for over an hour, deciding if I wanted to take on the task of raising $ 25,000 dollars for a complete stranger to help him achieve his dream, I read the article one more time and the following paragraph - gave me the answer:</p>

<p>My name is Nicole Palomba and I am a storyteller. I graduated from Chapman University with a BFA in Theatre Performance in 2010. Since graduation I have been pursuing my passion for theatre and community outreach in various performance and volunteer endeavors culminating in my latest journey- an internship in Ghana. It has been a dream of mine to go to Africa since I began my studies at Chapman, and an even longer dream to use theatre to change the world. Theatre is more than a medium, it has the potential to be a tool for change and a springboard for people to grow into who they have always been to afraid or ill-equipped to become. This internship is a drama therapy training at an Autism Center in Accra, Ghana. The people at this center have by no fault of their own the tools to communicate their own stories and I cannot wait to provide them the opportunity. </p>
<p><strong>The Bottom Line...</strong></p>
<p>Getting down to business...I am looking to fundraise $5000 to help cover my own medical costs, airfare and program costs as well as school supplies I plan to bring with me. I have to get several rounds of shots as well as pills as well as visa application fees. Any extra money will be donated straight to the Autism Awareness and Care Center. </p>
<p>Program Costs IN EUROS $2000</p>
<p>Flights $2000</p>
<p>Misc. Medical and Visa $1500</p>
<p><strong>So what's in it for you?</strong></p>
<p>Great question. Although this campaign does not have a concrete product at the end of it, I can offer you some inspirational and hearwarming <strong>PERKS!</strong> once I arrive.</p>
<p>$25- A <em>MAILED</em> photo and thank you letter from Ghana with the students. </p>
<p>$100- Sponsor of the day shout-outs on the blog and a thank you letter from Ghana. </p>
<p>$200- Photo Album (once I return) and personalized thank you from the students and myself as well as a video shout out and thank you letter from Ghana. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>In Essence...</strong></p>
<p>The most important outcome of this trip is awareness for the autistic community in Accra and the emphasis and understanding of drama therapy as a tool for communication. Even if you cannot donate, please spread the word or pass on the links- the more people who understand and are interested, the stronger the chances are that we can make a louder difference in Accra. We all have a difficult time expressing ourselves and handling our lives, but most of us were blessed with the capacities to verbalize our struggle in some way. That is the gift I am trying to give to the people at AACT. Theatre has always had a healing power; we can use someone else's words to reveal our own struggle, which is a simple gift we can perpetuate together. </p></div>","So here we go!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kristin. I have been working as a Licensed Practical Nurse in British Columbia, Canada for the last 3 years and I am currently enrolled in the second year of a Bachelor of Nursing program. I am truly passionate about the health and wellness of individuals and communities not only here at home, but on a global level as well. That is why I was extremely excited to recently learn that I had been selected to volunteer in South Africa in August of 2013 with International Student Volunteers (ISV).</p>
<p>International Student Volunteers is a volunteer and travel organization based in the USA. ISV volunteers have contributed more than 2 million hours of volunteer work across six continents. ISV is a world leader in student volunteer initiatives. Many members of the U.S. Congress endorse ISV, and the U.S. Center for Citizen Diplomacy in conjunction with the U.S. State Department recently selected ISV as one of the top ten international voluntary service organizations. ISV also recently received the award for “Outstanding Volunteer Project” at the 2011 World Youth and Student Travel Conference. ISV believes in responsible travel, sustainable projects and making a difference while traveling abroad. For more information about ISV, please visit <a href=""http://www.isvolunteers.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.isvolunteers.org</a>.</p>
<p>While on my community development project, I’ll learn about the socio-economic challenges of people living in developing countries and communities, which will strengthen my understanding of the world at large and lead me on a path of humanitarian efforts to impact our world for years to come. Past ISV volunteers have worked with children in orphanages and rescue centers, and built schools, medical facilities and community gardens, among other assignments. With your help, I will be able to broaden my cultural and social awareness, as well as improve the quality of life for disadvantaged families and children.</p>
<p>The ISV program also has a strong educational component, and I am really looking forward to learning about the global issues facing other countries, and how I can help. In addition, I will be receiving academic credit for independant study through my University.</p>
<p> I am so grateful to have an opportunity to assist others in the world, but, as you may know, international travel can be somewhat costly. This is why I’m asking for your help. I would be grateful donations of any amount that you could provide. Your donation will go toward my program cost of 3795.00$ and airfare costs of 2215.00$. The program cost includes accommodations, most meals, project materials and support, ground transportation, and tour guidance.</p>
<p>Please know that any support you can offer will go a long way toward changing the lives of others, including mine. If you are unable to make a financial contribution, you can still help! Spread the word and make others aware of my cause by word of mouth, phone, email, and don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>I greatly appreciate your consideration.</p>

<p>On a dark January Morning, I was laying in bed, wishing I didn't have to go to work that day.  I rolled onto my side and happened to feel a little bump on the left side of my left breast... I had never felt this before.  I asked my boyfriend to feel it, and he stated he had never felt that before either.  Deep down I had this gut feeling that something was not right.</p>
<p>I had just put in my two week notice at work and was in the midst of starting up another business.  My insurance was going to drop and I was left with the option to have a breast exam at planned parenthood.  The doctor there referred me to have some imaging done, however she told me she didn't think it was cancer.  To have an ultra-sound and a diagnostic mammogram was around $1,000.....money I didn't have to spend at that time.  I began looking online and found the BCC program...a program funded by the Susan G Komen Foundation.  After obtaining all documentation required, I went in for a breast exam by an appointed doctor who could directly enroll me in this program if she felt my lump was suspicious. This was now early April.  She stated it was a solid mass and I should have a mammogram.  I was then enrolled in the program and scheduled for a mammogram on Thursday April 11th.  I will forever be thankful for Susan G Komen, they provided me the imaging that saved my life.</p>
<p>I was nervous and worried that morning.  I had never had a mammogram or ultra sound before and was terrified from stories I had heard.  Come to find, none of them were true.  It wasn't until I was called back for the ultra-sound that I was faced with reality of my situation.  The tech took many images and then the radiologist came in.  I remember her words, 'Well Tracie, looks like we found something'. After that, everything became fuzzy.  Your mind starts to race.  It’s like a cloth is pulled over your face and it becomes hard to focus, even on the simple things like reading a text message.  I remember asking her what were the chances it was cancer, and she said 'highly likely'.  I was told to come back the following day for a biopsy, which would confirm if it was cancer.</p>
<p>I left the hospital in complete shock that day, tears streaming from my face and utter confusion.  I immediately phoned my boyfriend.  He told me not to stress out, as we didn't know anything was certain.  I tried my best to do this, but you can't ignore the feelings you encounter.  The next day I returned for my biopsy.  I have always been afraid of needles, and I quickly realized I needed to conquer this fear, as this was not going to be the last time.  As I mentioned before, I had the gut feeling something was wrong. I gripped the nurses arm while the doctor took 3 samples from each suspicious spot, you would have thought I was giving birth by how tight I was holding onto her arm!  Before long, it was done.  Phew!  The rest of the day I was spoiled at home, as I wasn’t supposed to do anything but rest.</p>
<p>Our weekend was great and quick as always....then, it was Monday.</p>
<p>Monday afternoon my doctor called and left me a voicemail.  She said she wanted to discuss my results...right then, I knew it wasn't good news.  I was diagnosed that afternoon with two spots of invasive breast cancer in my left breast. I did not shed a tear, as I had been mentally preparing myself for this by assuming the worst.  I took the pro-active approach and asked, 'what's next'.  I wanted the cancer out of my body and I wanted to get back to my regular life as soon as possible.  However battling cancer is a process, there are many important steps you must take.  You must stay strong and trust the professionals to fix you.</p>
<p>The next few months were full of appointments.  Surgery consultations, Oncology appointments, Fertility appointments and etc.  Everyone was so nice, supportive and caring.  My fears were lessened and I kept my positive and carefree outlook throughout this entire process so far!  It makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE if you can stay positive :) </p>
<h3>I am now 4 weeks past my bilateral mastectomy.  When my oncologist told me I needed chemotherapy, so many thoughts ran through my head.  How would this effect my daily life?  Would this effect my ability to have children?  I was told chemo can make women sterile.  This made my heart drop.  I have always wanted children, my own children, and now this?!  I was then referred to Oregon Reproductive Medicine.  I went through with an extreme fast-track fertility program to freeze my eggs.  I had my egg retrieval on 6/13/13.  63 eggs were retrieved, with 49 being mature enough to freeze.  I feel so blessed that they were able to obtain so many and that my body reacted well to all the medication and hormones.</h3>
<p>Now , I have 8 rounds of chemo ahead of me.  I am nervous, anxious and all of the above.  My bill for Oregon Reproductive Medicine just arrived and I owe $3,000.  I am simply hoping that people will read my story and know that even a $5 donation helps! 100% of money donated will fund my bill with Oregon Reproductive Medicine.</p>
<p>I thank you for reading my story and for possibly donating towards my egg retrieval.  Feel free to reach out to me at anytime.</p>

Rafael Yashinsky, 15 years old.  Found close to $2,000 dollars walking 
home from the bus stop yesterday (Dec 13th).  From the moment he found 
it he only wanted to return it to the police (he does admit thinking about keeping it for about a millisecond).  The police will spend 30 days trying to 
find the owner, if not under Michigan law, he is entitled to keep it. 
 He is only interested in donating that money to charity in the unlikely
 case that the owner is not found.  I think the Internet

Short Summary:<br/><br/>
Troy High School Student – Rafael Yashinsky, age 15, was walking home 
after school and found an envelope sitting in the snow next to the 
sidewalk on the North end of Troy.<br/><br/>
The envelope contained a large sum of cash in large denominations. 
Rafael immediately took the envelope and cash home to advise his parents
 and then brought the money to the Troy Police Department.<br/><br/>
As Rafael's uncle I knew I wanted to find a way to reward Rafael for his
 honesty and integrity, and I thought you, the Internet, might want to 
join me.  This campaign is an effort to reward Rafael for his kindness and honesty, and also show him how special we think he is.  His efforts 
may result in saving someone's Christmas (Rafael's birthday) , and I for
 one think we should show him how much people appreciate his honesty.<br/><br/>
Rafael has said that he only did what he would want someone else to do 
if they found his money.  I believe that by kicking in even a buck or 
two that we can show him just how great we think his act was.<br/><br/>
Ideally we could raise the same amount of money that we Rafael turned 
in. ($2000.)  I believe it would be an amazing way to show that sometimes the 
universe works to reward you for your good deeds.  I cannot do it by 
myself, but if 1 out of every 100 people who liked his story on facebook
 gave 2 dollars, he could have as much money as would have gotten if he 
did the wrong thing, maybe more ;-).<br/><br/>
Your small act could show, demonstrate to Rafael and the world that 
humanity has not lost its way.  You can encourage other around you to do
 the right thing the next time they find something of great value.  If 
the people who could afford to donate just a dollar or two all did, 
together we could make a big statement heard all around the world.<br/><br/>
If you can't afford to donate, please consider sharing this campaign 
with your friends.  Indiegogo has tools to make it super easy.  This 
story is the perfect antidote to the materialism that is easy to get 
caught up in this time of year.  It will warm almost anyone's heart. Thank you for taking the time to read this.  Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a Happy Healthy New Year!!!!<br/></div>","Description:
Rafael Yashinsky, 15 years old.  Found close to $2,000 dollars walking 
home from the bus stop yesterday (Dec 13th).  From the moment he found 
it he only wanted to return it to the police (he does admit thinking about keeping it for about a millisecond).  The police will spend 30 days trying to 
find the owner, if not under Michigan law, he is entitled to keep it. 
 He is only interested in donating that money to charity in the unlikely
 case that the owner is not found.  I think the Internet
 should reward Rafael's generous heart and soul.  He is one of the 
nicest and most genuine people I know.  His birthday happens to be Dec 25th so let's work together an try to raise a nice reward for this amazing example for us all.  Maybe he can use this money for his college in a few years.

<p>In Cebu, Philippines on Mactan island there is a group of bikers who have been contributing to various activities helping children in the surrounding area and throughout other areas as far south as Mindanao. Such activities have included school materials(books, pencils, pens, paper, drawing materials, chairs, computers, etc...) and medical supplies focused soley on children.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>I became involved with this “gang” last year. After understanding what it is they do I decided to get involved by contributing a few laptops to a SOS School(<a href=""http://www.sos-schools.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sos-schools.org/</a>) in the area. Now they are turning to the internet to expand their reach for donations since the local community and expat community is limited to basically the same contributors.</p>
<p>We are looking for those of you who are passionate bikers that can donate whatever amount to a group of bikers helping impoverished children who need your assistance. We simply needs the donations and after that we can do the rest. And even if you are not a biker, please donate just the same!</p>
<h3 class=""western"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a total of <strong>$3,500</strong> that will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>School materials - books, pencils, pens, paper, drawing materials, chairs, computers, etc...</p>
</li>
<li>Medical kits and supplies for children</li>
<li>
<p>Fresh water supply system for a school in Bayawan(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayawan"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayawan</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>With the funds that are given the bikers will purchase the proper supplies and distribute them to the impoverished areas and most importantly spend time with the children. There is nothing better than a burly, tattoo laden biker riding on a grumbling motorcycle with help and care to these children in need.</strong> It really is a great way to make use of any extra money that you can spare.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal we will simply have less to give to the children. Of course we will try our best to make up for it by seeking more contributions from the locals and local expats in the community but we would love to reach our goal with our first campaign. We will post videos from this first campaing and hopefully have more campaigns to follow here on Indiegogo.</p>
<h3 class=""western"">The Impact</h3>
<p>Although the Philippines economy is one of the strongest in Asia, money is not trickling down to the poorest of the poor. They continue to need our assistance, and not only assistance but that helping hand and friendly smile that let's them know there are those who care about them and their well being. We feel that your contribution goes far with us due to the delivery of the supplies needed by the children and the care with which it is done.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, are many projects in the past that have been funded and completed. This group knows how to facilitate this type of operation. We will display a video of the happy children as they receive the gifts that are made possible by your donation. Our hope is that we can continue to use this same system of collecting online donations so that our reach and impact is even greater with large projects and contributions. Please help us start off on the right foot with your simple donation.</p>
<h3 class=""western"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p> Thank you for taking the time to check out my campaign!</p>
<p>I’m Angélica De Jesús, a recent grad, outreach worker, and nerdy yogini raising $2,300 to fund my journey to becoming a yoga instructor.</p>
<p>Interested in helping me get closer to implementing intersectionally inclusive, body positive, and economically accessible yoga&amp;meditation classes within community service programs here in RVA? Read on!</p>
<p><strong> Meet the Fundraiser</strong></p>
<p>I began practicing yoga in high school as a means to manage anxiety and stress. Since that first sunrise practice, around seven years ago, yoga has provided me with the inner strength to navigate through life’s challenges and personal obstacles. Even during very difficult times, my practice has given me the peace to continue working to achieve my dreams.</p>
<p>One of my <em>biggest</em> dreams has been to empower others in my community to have the option of beginning their own practice and experiencing the power of yoga in their own right.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Step One : Reaching Out </strong></p>
<p>Yoga is great. The word itself holds so much meaning. Yoga originates from the Sanskrit <em>yuj</em>, and is rooted in the idea of unity. <br/> Unity of body and mind. Unity of outer and inner self.<br/> Unity of the individual and their neighbors.</p>
<p>Comm<strong>unity. <br/></strong>Awesome right?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in my few years of practice i've recognized that yoga classes are often inaccessable to a signifcant numer of folks. Drawing on those principles of unity, I have begun a journey to closing some of the demographic gaps.  </p>
<p> I’ve recently partnered with the <a href=""http://www.dailyplanetva.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Daily Planet</a>, a clinic offering holistic healthcare services to the homeless, at-risk homeless and underserved community of Richmond City, to bring meditation classes to their patient population. Now I’d like to expand upon that project by offering free yoga classes. And thats just the first step!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong>Step Two: Get certified!</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.4025yoga.com/4025_Yoga/Home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">4025 Yoga</a>, the local studio where I’ll be getting my yoga teacher certification, or RYT225, has granted me a work-study position, greatly reducing my tuition, but I need your support to get the rest of the way.</p>
<ul>
<li>$<strong>1700</strong> will go towards paying off my tuition (<strong>originally $3500</strong>)</li>
<li>$<strong>450 </strong>will go towards required studio hours
<ul>
<li>30hrs @ 4025 yoga ($10/class)</li>
<li>30hrs @ various community classes (~ $5/class)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$<strong>150</strong> will go towards educational materials and supplies (i.e. books, DVD’s, lectures, etc)</li>
</ul><p>$2,300 is a lot of money, but with your help that goal can be met! And there are plenty of perks to pick from; every donation is reciprocated by a little something from me. I work hard (making/sending things) for the money! ^-^</p>
<p><strong>Step Three: Reaching Further </strong></p>
<p>Completing the training will enable me to bring a full yoga class to the Daily Planet patients and staff.  I will also be able to move forward with plans to bring classes to at-risk youth, mental health clinics, social service workers, and to a broader spectrum of the community here in Richmond. In addition, I plan on hosting a body positive yoga-workshop for young women, and classes in Spanish!</p>
<p>My main goal is to empower people in our community, people who often do not have access to many health resources, to take their health into their hands, and get what they need to fulfill their own goals and dreams.</p>

<p> <strong>Step Together: Support the cause</strong></p>
<p> Whether you make a donation or spread the word, any and all support is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for visiting my campaign and for becoming a part of the movement to empower our communities to become happier, healthier places.</p>
<p>Again, $2,300 is a lot, but with all ya'lls help, it is completely possible.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
On January 9, 2013, teachers at Garfield High School in Seattle unanimously announced their intention to boycott the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) test.  They also published a <a href=""http://scrapthemap.wordpress.com/2013/01/25/the-letter-from-the-teachers-at-garfield-high-school-regarding-the-map-test/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""The letter from the teachers at Garfield High School regarding the MAP test"">letter</a> describing their reasons for engaging in the boycott.  Since the initial announcement of a boycott by Garfield High School teachers, a number of other schools in Seattle have <a href=""http://scrapthemap.wordpress.com/participating-schools/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Participating Schools"">joined the boycott</a>, including Ballard High School, The Center School, Chief Sealth International High School, and Orca K-8 School.  Educators, professors, parents, and community members across the country have <a href=""http://scrapthemap.wordpress.com/solidarity-statements-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Solidarity Statements"">written in support</a> of the boycott.  Thousands of people have signed an <a href=""https://www.change.org/petitions/seattle-public-schools-support-seattle-teachers-refusing-to-administer-the-map"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">online petition</a> to the Superintendent of Seattle Public Schools.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
The Seattle School District originally threatened MAP test boycotting teachers with a 10 day suspension with out pay.  Since then they have backed off that threat verbally although nothing has been rescinded in writing.  What was made clear was that there would be ""consequences"" for our boycott.  We hope we won't have to raise money for suspended teachers, but we are waiting to find out what the consequences will be. For right now, our effort will be focused on raising funds to publicize the boycott and organize broader solidarity.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>Although we have set a minimum goal of $1000, we hope to raise as much as possible.  The more funds we have, the more we will be able to do to build this campaign and support the participating teachers.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>1. Call, email, and write to Seattle Public Schools Superintendent José L. Banda to let him know that you support the boycott and to demand that the participating teachers receive no disciplinary action.</p>
<p style=""padding-top: 14px; text-align: center;"">Superintendent José L. Banda<br/> (206) 252-0180<br/><a href=""mailto:superintendent@seattleschools.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">superintendent@seattleschools.org</a><br/> Office of the Superintendent<br/> MS: 32-150<br/> P.O.

</div></div>","Short Summary
On January 9, 2013, teachers at Garfield High School in Seattle unanimously announced their intention to boycott the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) test.  They also published a letter describing their reasons for engaging in the boycott.  Since the initial announcement of a boycott by Garfield High School teachers, a number of other schools in Seattle have joined the boycott, including Ballard High School, The Center School, Chief Sealth International High School, and Orca K-8 School.  Educators, professors, parents, and community members across the country have written in support of the boycott.  Thousands of people have signed an online petition to the Superintendent of Seattle Public Schools.

What We Need
The Seattle School District originally threatened MAP test boycotting teachers with a 10 day suspension with out pay.  Since then they have backed off that threat verbally although nothing has been rescinded in writing.  What was made clear was that there would be ""consequences"" for our boycott.  We hope we won't have to raise money for suspended teachers, but we are waiting to find out what the consequences will be. For right now, our effort will be focused on raising funds to publicize the boycott and organize broader solidarity.

Although we have set a minimum goal of $1000, we hope to raise as much as possible.  The more funds we have, the more we will be able to do to build this campaign and support the participating teachers.

Other Ways You Can Help
1. Call, email, and write to Seattle Public Schools Superintendent José L. Banda to let him know that you support the boycott and to demand that the participating teachers receive no disciplinary action.

<p>In the past we have worked with a small cooperative in the state of Veracruz (Mexico) helping the villagers to sell the local vanilla that they produce. We are really happy with our achievements to date and want to keep helping small communities and cooperatives within Mexico.</p>
<p>This time we want to help several low-income villages in the Valley of Perote (Mexico). We aim to work with them, showing them how to build and maintain Adobe Stoves which do not require the use of petrol or gas.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>These particular stoves also use less firewood and prevent several of the health issues associated with traditional firewood cooking that is common in the area. They prove extremely beneficial to the local villagers and not to mention the environment. Not only do they reduce the expenses and health issues among the local people, they also lessen the need for cutting down trees in the area, helping to contribute to a lowered carbon footprint.</p>
<p>So far we have built 80 stoves like these all over the country (Mexico) and we have been able to see the great impact they have for low income families. This time we want to take the next step and build at least 100 more of them in poor communities in preparation for this coming winter. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The estimated cost of each stove is $500 USD, which includes the building materials, labour costs, and the transportation of the materials and the people involved in this task within the local communities.</p>
<p>Each adobe stove can easily last up to 20 years with no maintenance at all and if they are routinely maintained they can even last longer and the benefits that these can cause in the families located in the Valley of Perote are priceless.</p>

It boasts incredible hidden villages and small towns incomparable to any other place.</p>
<p>Despite the extreme beauty and great richness of the country, some of its people suffer from extreme poverty; the Valley of Perote  is one of the poorest places in the state of Veracruz. The temperatures go below 0°C during winter and people who live in all the small communities in the region traditionally cook outside using firewood. Cooking with firewood can cause several health issues in the lungs and is directly related with many kinds of cancer. </p>

</p><p>The
conference represents a rare opportunity for people interested in Southland
Bohemia to engage in an exciting and revealing exchange of ideas. The result
will be the first overview of Southern California’s alternative creative worlds.
When published, it will be available to anyone wishing to
know more about what has been a well-kept secret. Southland Bohemia has, at
times, been overshadowed by Greenwich Village in New York and North Beach in
San Francisco. It is our intention to correct that oversight. The
amazing works of extraordinary people will be critically examined and the varied
ways in which a distinctive Bohemia was created will be revealed.
This is a first-ever event of its kind; it will alter forever how Bohemia is
understood. We need your support to achieve this singular goal.</p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> <br/></span></p><p></p><h3>The Program and Speakers </h3><p></p><p>Over a three day period, these speakers will present papers and enter into a discussion with each other and the audience.<br/></p><p>

<p></p></div>","A Conference on Bohemia in Southern California - A Much Needed Addition to The History of Those Who Followed The Beat of a Different Drummer
JAY RUBY, Conference Organizer   
                             
·        Let
me introduce myself. I am the organizer of the conference and art exhibit.  I am an emeritus professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. who has written over 12 books, 75 scholarly articles and organized various conferences since 1968. My recent research has concentrated on Southland Bohemia with a study of Coffee House Positano in Malibu and The Property - a community of creative people also in Malibu.
BEYOND BAROQUE, Host and SponsorBeyond Baroque, located in Venice, California, was founded in 1968, and is one of the United States' leading independent Literary |
Arts Centers and public spaces.Why This Conference is Important
The
conference represents a rare opportunity for people interested in Southland
Bohemia to engage in an exciting and revealing exchange of ideas. The result
will be the first overview of Southern California’s alternative creative worlds.
When published, it will be available to anyone wishing to
know more about what has been a well-kept secret. Southland Bohemia has, at
times, been overshadowed by Greenwich Village in New York and North Beach in
San Francisco. It is our intention to correct that oversight. The
amazing works of extraordinary people will be critically examined and the varied
ways in which a distinctive Bohemia was created will be revealed.
This is a first-ever event of its kind; it will alter forever how Bohemia is
understood. We need your support to achieve this singular goal. The Program and Speakers Over a three day period, these speakers will present papers and enter into a discussion with each other and the audience.

<p>Global Voice promotes youth leadership and development through cultural exchange and service-learning—a concept where learning takes place through volunteer service projects that benefit communities at home and abroad. The founders (the Griffin family) created the program in 2003 where they performed a cultural exchange with a group of Northern Ireland youth and youth from Lyon and Storey count<span>ies. Community projects were targeted around hunger and homelessness as well as religious divisions and beautification projects at two youth centers.</span></p>
<p><span>Global Voice has continued this model with yearly<br/>trips to locations in Costa Rica and Mexico including Ajijic, Teacapan and<br/>Loreto. We have worked with schools, orphanages and other organizations in<br/>practicing the cultural exchange through service model.<span>  Trips usually last 2 weeks in duration and involve fundraising, planning, post trip reflections and continued service projects at home.  </span><br/><br/>Global Voice programs are sponsored through Community Chest, Inc. This organization strives to promote community building, youth leadership and social justice programs in Northern Nevada. CCI’s methodology regarding its youth programs places service-learning at its core; using this methodology, youth learn about themselves, their communities and the world in which they live by working together.</span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This year our Global Voice team will be traveling to Galway, Ireland. Our high school students have been working hard to raise $25,000 to pay their expenses. They need to cover transportation, lodging, food and supplies for their service project. To date the kids have been able to secure $7,000 and are still working! We need your help to continue! </p>

</span></div>","What is Global Voice? 
Global Voice promotes youth leadership and development through cultural exchange and service-learning—a concept where learning takes place through volunteer service projects that benefit communities at home and abroad. The founders (the Griffin family) created the program in 2003 where they performed a cultural exchange with a group of Northern Ireland youth and youth from Lyon and Storey counties. Community projects were targeted around hunger and homelessness as well as religious divisions and beautification projects at two youth centers.
Global Voice has continued this model with yearlytrips to locations in Costa Rica and Mexico including Ajijic, Teacapan andLoreto. We have worked with schools, orphanages and other organizations inpracticing the cultural exchange through service model.  Trips usually last 2 weeks in duration and involve fundraising, planning, post trip reflections and continued service projects at home.  Global Voice programs are sponsored through Community Chest, Inc. This organization strives to promote community building, youth leadership and social justice programs in Northern Nevada. CCI’s methodology regarding its youth programs places service-learning at its core; using this methodology, youth learn about themselves, their communities and the world in which they live by working together.
 
What We Need & What You Get
This year our Global Voice team will be traveling to Galway, Ireland. Our high school students have been working hard to raise $25,000 to pay their expenses. They need to cover transportation, lodging, food and supplies for their service project. To date the kids have been able to secure $7,000 and are still working! We need your help to continue! 
                                         How can you help?
                 $30........One night of accommodations for one student
                 $100…..Will allow the group to experience some Irish culture
                 $288…..Full trip accommodations for one student
                 $500......Will help to pay for the supplies needed for the service project. 
                 $1,000…...A plane ticket for one student
                 $1,500….Meals for the group for the trip
                 $3,500...Lodging for the group for the tripWhat will you get in return? Well, apart from helping develop the leadership skills of youth and bettering communities in Ireland and Nevada...
1. For a donation of just $25 you will receive a handwritten thank you card including a picture of our completed service project! 
2. 15 lucky donors will receive a personal service project for only $100! Our group of 12 Global Voice participants will be made available. 
3. One of our Global Voice youth is a very talented artist. For only $200 she will create a one of a kind masterpiece just for you!

<h3>Riley's Kids</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Riley, a 17 year old girl, on a crazy mission lead by God to open a 60 bed orphanage in Kibwezi, Kenya in June 2014. I was blessed with the opportunity to fill ""Gail's House"" with 60 orphaned kids.  I am currently speaking at churches and doing other fundraisers but as you can see I have a lot to raise in a little time.  We are working towards shipping a container, finishing the kitchen, buying a car in Kenya, and many other necessities to make Riley's Kids feel safe and loved. </p>
<p>""Gails House"" is the only 100% solar powered orphanage in Kenya.  It also already has a  bore hole. The orphanage has yet to have sweet Kenyan kids in it.  The building has been complete for a couple of years. Hopefully with everyone's help we can get the doors open.  I am so excited for the opportunity to make a lasting impression on these kids lives.</p>
<p>I have been to Kibwezi the last four years where in June 2013 I opened my first school called Pamoja.  We built and are funding the school.  Pamoja has 50 students that attend primary school there.</p>
<p>As you can see my heart is definitely in Kibwezi as I plan to make this my home after college.  </p>

The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that by 2020, there will be more the 1.4 million job openings in the computing-related fields. With current graduation trends, only about 30% of those jobs will be filled by U.S. bachelor's degree. At approximately half of the population, girls are currently the most valuable talent pool.

If the technologies continue to be developed by only half of the population then we are all missing out on the creativity, innovation and possibilities that savvy technical women can bring. With your support we can increase the gender balance in computer science and STEM.Risks & ChallengesDelivering a quality program is a significant financial risk. Although we have a strong five year track record of support from industry partners, we need additional funding to scale this program and reach a wider audience.   We have the experience, passion and commitment to deliver a world-class program
 By leveraging technology, such as Live Streaming and Intelligent Mentor Matching, we can reach more students with fewer resources

<h3>Changing the Life of a Child</h3> <p></p>
<p>Women widowed
by the horribly violent riots in 2007 and 2008, were left destitute. They
needed help with their children’s immediate needs, and they worried about their
children’s future. With the nearest school a 6 hour drive away, the younger
children had to stay with their mothers who worked in the fields as daily wage
laborers. The older children, often left alone during the day, were open to
involvement in drugs and petty crime. The future of the children of Kandhamal
region, Odisha, was in jeopardy. Having a local school in the region became
imperative. </p>
<p>The school
will be accessible to children in remote areas as a beacon of hope for a bright
future to a large number of Odisha’s children––forgotten until now. Your gift
will make a tangible, lasting difference in lives of many people.</p>
Today
50 children, 4 to 6 years old, are enrolled. Our goal of $15,000 will cover
room and board, uniforms, books, and tuition for up to 50 children for one
school year. The cost to support one child is $300/year or $25/month.  </div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1062578/files/20141201165241-gifts.jpg?1417481561"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

<p>By donating you are directly sponsoring another seat for a child to join the musical event.</p>
<p>The children we work with are the most marginalized in their society. Because of their status, they must fight stigma and fear. This event, part of an ongoing project in Rwanda, will help them connect with each other, with their families, make them stronger, and bring them some joy and relief. Please donate today.</p>
<h2 style=""color: #0093d0; font-style: italic;"">Rwanda Youth Music / Musicians without Borders</h2>
<p><strong>In 2012 Musicians without Borders initiated a yearlong music project for 25 youth leaders in Kigali, Rwanda</strong>.</p>
<p>They were trained to use the power of music to bring joy and healing to hundreds of underprivileged children.</p>
<p>Now, a year later, on March 2nd, the youth leaders will receive a diploma for their training. There will be a ceremony with all of the children and families the youth leaders have worked with in the program. It will be a beautiful event that the youth leaders are organizing themselves.</p>
<p>For this music event we have invited Keren Rosenbaum, an interdisciplinary composer from New York. She will work with the youth leaders for one week, preparing and guiding them to produce and run the event. Your donation today will help us reach our goal so we can include 800 people.

By donating you are directly sponsoring another seat for a child to join the musical event.
The children we work with are the most marginalized in their society. Because of their status, they must fight stigma and fear. This event, part of an ongoing project in Rwanda, will help them connect with each other, with their families, make them stronger, and bring them some joy and relief. Please donate today.
Rwanda Youth Music / Musicians without Borders
In 2012 Musicians without Borders initiated a yearlong music project for 25 youth leaders in Kigali, Rwanda.
They were trained to use the power of music to bring joy and healing to hundreds of underprivileged children.
Now, a year later, on March 2nd, the youth leaders will receive a diploma for their training. There will be a ceremony with all of the children and families the youth leaders have worked with in the program. It will be a beautiful event that the youth leaders are organizing themselves.
For this music event we have invited Keren Rosenbaum, an interdisciplinary composer from New York. She will work with the youth leaders for one week, preparing and guiding them to produce and run the event. Your donation today will help us reach our goal so we can include 800 people. Youth leaders, children, parents, elders, even babies, will be actively engaged in a huge musical score/performance, creating music together, following a musical game that the youth leaders are designing and will guide themselves.
Communication practices are one of the key factors in maintaining a healthy, supportive community, which these children and their families need the most.

</p><p>You
have probably heard about STOP’s fight to save the mental health clinics. We’re
in this struggle for people like Diane Adams. After Diane lost her son to
violence in 1996, she sank into a deep depression. The only way she was able to
find the will to survive was through the free services at the Auburn Gresham
mental health clinic. That’s why, when the city threatened to close her clinic,
she knew she had to do everything she could to stop it.</p>
<p>STOP
was there to support Diane to become one of the leaders of the fight to save
the clinics. I’m asking you today if you can be there to support STOP.</p>
<p>For

poor. We have:</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Built the Mental Health Movement,</b> which saved 4 Southside mental health
clinics in 2008 and is fighting to reverse the recent closure of half of the
city’s mental health clinics.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Organized 7 tenants associations
in subsidized housing, </strong>one of these is Grove Parc, which in 2008 halted the displacement of over 500 families
and prevented
the
elimination of half of Woodlawn's subsidized housing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Preserved the Kimbark subsidized buildings </b>and won the hiring of residents to work on the rehab.</p>
<p><b>Developed Fearless Leading by the Youth</b>, which helped improve conditions
in the juvenile detention center, by ensuring
access to clean clothes and cleaner facilities. FLY also leads a campaign for a Southside
trauma center.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>STOP’s mission is to advance economic and social human rights
by organizing and developing leadership among people most affected by economic
and racial oppression. </b>Our base has grown from an initial
group of tenants from a single housing complex to include over 1,200 tenants
from 5 complexes and 800 homeowners, youth, mental health patients, homeless
and unemployed people, and community allies.</p>
<p>With
active campaigns around housing, mental health, trauma care, and juvenile
justice STOP is steady growing and deepening our roots. STOP is developing into
an organization that can engage in this work for the long haul. But we need
your support to help sustain STOP and build this movement. </p>

<p>Unlike the <em>universally</em> available public education available in the United States and other developed nations around the world, the public education system in Haiti is unable to serve the needs of the Haitian population.  Only 67 percent of eligible students are enrolled in primary and elementary schools and the vast majority of these students are enrolled in private schools funded by NGOs or paid for out-of-pocket by parents who are likely struggling to even put food on the table. Of these students, less than 1/3 successfully complete 6 years of primary school education.

<p><b>A Vision for Better Education in Haiti</b></p>
<p>Founded with a vision of empowering Haiti's young people to empower eachother, The St. Joseph Family was founded in 1985 to bring homeless boys off the streets of Port-au-Prince and provide them with a Christian home and family. From these humble beginnings, this Family has grown to include several mission centers, which care for and educate the disabled and disadvantaged children of Haiti.  Among these mission centers are the St. Joseph's Home for Boys in Port-au-Prince and Trinity House in Jacmel, which together provide a family life and education for 23 boys. </p>

For that reason all boys are enrolled in private schools near the home, receive tutoring on weekday evenings, and have access to a computer lab with controlled Internet access. These opportunities, combined with their hard work, give them an excellent chance to succeed in the classroom and be part of the small number of youth in Haiti that have access to secondary vocational education or matriculation to other university programs after completing their secondary schooling.  The programs of the St. Joseph's Home for Boys and Trinity House provide the kind of all-encompassing support that only a family can offer and, as a result, graduates have gone on to further education, careers, and have become responsible parents themselves.</p>

<p>Little Jazz Man
is a new book series for young children written by T. Lawrence Layton and
illustrated by Seno Muminovic.  It has
repeated lines, interactive characters and toys, and fun to read.  This is the first of a planned series of four
books about Little Jazz Man.  ELI and the
author will be donating 200 copies of Little Jazz Man free to families of
children with special needs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><b>The author: </b>T. Lawrence Layton Ph.D. has
worked in the area of literacy and language for over 40 years.  He has been a University professor,
researcher, author, and speech-language therapist serving children with autism,
Down syndrome, language impairment, and developmental disorders.  He uses literacy and reading for his
treatment.  Although he has published numerous
professional books, articles, and tests, this is his first children’s
book.  </p>
<p><b>The
illustrator: </b>Senad Muminovic is from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  He credits
his father, Mahmut, for passing his talent for drawing on to him as a child. As
young boy in school he would enter art competitions and win first place. During
and following the Bosnian War (1992-1995) that resulted in the breakup of
Yugoslavia, Senad did not have access to art supplies.  In 1997 he met
volunteer relief workers from North Carolina who donated supplies to him so he
could begin to paint again. In 1999 some of his friends organized an exhibition
of his work and he began to take his art more seriously. Senad says he is
grateful to his father for teaching him, and to his American friends for giving
him the motivation to resume painting.   He is an accomplished illustrator
and has illustrated two children's books for a Croatian author and one in the
US.  Besides painting, Senad composes music for the piano and enjoys
playing all styles, but particularly enjoys jazz, gospel, and classical music.</p>
<p>Senad says that music
gives him the motivation and inspiration for everything he does.  </p>

Pledge of $22,000 goal
Little Jazz Man
is a new book series for young children written by T. Lawrence Layton and
illustrated by Seno Muminovic.  It has
repeated lines, interactive characters and toys, and fun to read.  This is the first of a planned series of four
books about Little Jazz Man.  ELI and the
author will be donating 200 copies of Little Jazz Man free to families of
children with special needs.
The author: T. Lawrence Layton Ph.D. has
worked in the area of literacy and language for over 40 years.  He has been a University professor,
researcher, author, and speech-language therapist serving children with autism,
Down syndrome, language impairment, and developmental disorders.  He uses literacy and reading for his
treatment.  Although he has published numerous
professional books, articles, and tests, this is his first children’s
book.  
The
illustrator: Senad Muminovic is from Bosnia and Herzegovina.  He credits
his father, Mahmut, for passing his talent for drawing on to him as a child. As
young boy in school he would enter art competitions and win first place. During
and following the Bosnian War (1992-1995) that resulted in the breakup of
Yugoslavia, Senad did not have access to art supplies.  In 1997 he met
volunteer relief workers from North Carolina who donated supplies to him so he
could begin to paint again. In 1999 some of his friends organized an exhibition
of his work and he began to take his art more seriously. Senad says he is
grateful to his father for teaching him, and to his American friends for giving
him the motivation to resume painting.   He is an accomplished illustrator
and has illustrated two children's books for a Croatian author and one in the
US.  Besides painting, Senad composes music for the piano and enjoys
playing all styles, but particularly enjoys jazz, gospel, and classical music.
Senad says that music
gives him the motivation and inspiration for everything he does.

The keeper’s job is to defend the goal hoops. Beaters use bludgers (dodgeballs) to “knock out” opposing players; any player hit by a bludger is out of play until they touch their own hoops. The seeker tries to catch the snitch. The snitch is a ball attached to the waistband of the snitch runner, a neutral athlete in a yellow uniform who uses any means to avoid capture.

funds for completing our oven. In addition we are asking for funds to begin
more joint projects like this one to spread the word of natural building. <b>About

this began as a workshop and turned into a volunteer project, the total cost
will come to about $1000. This is for the clay, sand, straw, bricks, and
perlite we have already bought, and for the gas to get it all. </p>
<h2>Investing in our Shared Dream</h2><p>Finally we want to continue doing these projects together, and
there are many operating costs associated with keeping it all going. So we will

or a small shelter. All donations are warmly accepted no matter how small.</p>
<h2>Abundance</h2><p>Finally, for those who can’t give financially, your helping
hands, your food and snack contributions, your vehicles are so greatly
appreciated. This is not about asking people with limited finances to stretch
themselves even more. No. <b>That’s stressful. </b>We don’t want that. But if you
happen to be working out there in the world and you have a good job that pays
well, then feel free to donate more. <b>If you happen to have savings or

Investing in our Shared DreamFinally we want to continue doing these projects together, and
there are many operating costs associated with keeping it all going. So we will
need another $500 to cover overhead and be able to plan future oven and bench
building projects.
What we are really asking is that we surpass the minimum goal of
$1500. Please donate generously so that we may make this oven look beautiful
and so that we can begin another teaching project, either an oven, or a bench
or a small shelter. All donations are warmly accepted no matter how small.
AbundanceFinally, for those who can’t give financially, your helping
hands, your food and snack contributions, your vehicles are so greatly
appreciated. This is not about asking people with limited finances to stretch
themselves even more. No. That’s stressful. We don’t want that. But if you
happen to be working out there in the world and you have a good job that pays
well, then feel free to donate more. If you happen to have savings or
investments that give in abundance then please donate liberally. These
workshops and community projects are very important invests too.  We want to have strong positive and lasting
impact on the way we all think about building our future.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

been growing and I have been working hard to pursue a career as an 
anthropologist to work with and help communities.
Four years ago I was finishing the third year of my bachelor degree in 
anthropology in my home country, Colombia when the opportunity to come 
to the US for one year to learn English came across and I saw it as a 
great way to learn about another culture, another language, and expand 
my opportunities to continue my education going to grad school in 
another country. 
After five months being here in the US a petition made by my dad in 2001
 to make him and his family permanent residents came current and I had 
to take the unexpected and hard decision between giving up the 
opportunity to become a resident and live in the US with my family in 
order to go back to my country and finish my studies, or put my school 
aside for some time and wait to get the permanent residence in the US. 
I decided to follow the second option, and stayed in this country trying
 to start a new life in order to get a better future. The wait for the 
residence has stretched for more than three years now and all this time I
 have felt extremely frustrated for not being able to finish school.
I have been working full time as a nanny since I came to the US, and 
have taken some classes at a community college, but with all the 
expenses of paying rent and being responsible for my younger brother I 
have not been able to finish more than one course per year, as I have to
 pay international student fees.

to do that I have to take 52 more units at the community college to 
finish the general education courses and being able to transfer the

which I do stay off campus. All I am asking of those that are willing,
to generously give what is in your heart to give. I do not ask for a

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Short Summary</span><br/>
</h3><p>This spring, 10 talented students from Tulane University will travel to Washington DC to participate in the Model Organization of American States (OAS). The Model OAS is a 5-day simulation of the General Assembly meeting of the Organization of American States. At the simulation students master the art of diplomacy, as they present policies that they prepared during a semester-long course. Students from all over the Western Hemisphere travel to DC to participate in this prestigious opportunity. This is a great opportunity for Tulane students to meet, connect with, and learn from Latin American students. This year, Tulane will attend the Model OAS as the Delegation of Brazil. In order to attend the Model OAS, we aim to raise $4,500, of which $2,000 will come from this campaign.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>In order to allow as many students from Tulane's campus to participate in the course and simulation, we cover as much of the travel costs as possible. This year, due to an unexpected increase in hotel prices, as well as increased airfare, we are forced to raise an additional $4,500 to cover our expenses for our 10 students. We aim to raise $2,000 through this campaign. All schools who participate in the Model are required to stay in the same hotel, which is where the simulation also takes place. We feel strongly that every dollar counts and will add up towards us reaching our goal! Also, all donations are tax deductible.  </p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Model OAS is an important class for Tulane undergrads because its interdisciplinary nature allows students from any major/minor to participate and to put into action what they have learned in their classes. Students practice writing and researching policy as well as learn about the art of diplomacy. Contributing even the smallest amount towards this class will help these talented Tulane students to put what they have learned in the classroom into practice. This is an experience that students are not likely to forget! The quotes below show the students' excitement to participate in this course! </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">""Model OAS is a unique opportunity to not only learn about issues pertinent to the Western Hemisphere, such as human rights, sustainable development, and public health, but also apply that knowledge to a practical setting. I am looking forward to meeting other students from all over the Americas and working with them to solve some of the most challenging problems."" </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Jennifer Rosenthal</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">""As the Portuguese Department's Research Assistant on Transitional Justice in Brazil, it's been my job to research and report on how the nation has been recently confronting its military past. This opportunity to pass policy in the Model OAS—<i>as Brazil—</i>to further its Transitional Justice process, is the most exciting application of my research that I could have dreamed of."" Pat Duffy </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">""I see MOAS as an opportunity to engage with nine other highly motivated Tulane students in working to understand an international democratic organization and the history of Latin American diplomatic relations from the perspective of Brazil.

This spring, 10 talented students from Tulane University will travel to Washington DC to participate in the Model Organization of American States (OAS). The Model OAS is a 5-day simulation of the General Assembly meeting of the Organization of American States. At the simulation students master the art of diplomacy, as they present policies that they prepared during a semester-long course. Students from all over the Western Hemisphere travel to DC to participate in this prestigious opportunity. This is a great opportunity for Tulane students to meet, connect with, and learn from Latin American students. This year, Tulane will attend the Model OAS as the Delegation of Brazil. In order to attend the Model OAS, we aim to raise $4,500, of which $2,000 will come from this campaign.What We NeedIn order to allow as many students from Tulane's campus to participate in the course and simulation, we cover as much of the travel costs as possible. This year, due to an unexpected increase in hotel prices, as well as increased airfare, we are forced to raise an additional $4,500 to cover our expenses for our 10 students. We aim to raise $2,000 through this campaign. All schools who participate in the Model are required to stay in the same hotel, which is where the simulation also takes place. We feel strongly that every dollar counts and will add up towards us reaching our goal! Also, all donations are tax deductible.  The ImpactModel OAS is an important class for Tulane undergrads because its interdisciplinary nature allows students from any major/minor to participate and to put into action what they have learned in their classes. Students practice writing and researching policy as well as learn about the art of diplomacy. Contributing even the smallest amount towards this class will help these talented Tulane students to put what they have learned in the classroom into practice. This is an experience that students are not likely to forget! The quotes below show the students' excitement to participate in this course! ""Model OAS is a unique opportunity to not only learn about issues pertinent to the Western Hemisphere, such as human rights, sustainable development, and public health, but also apply that knowledge to a practical setting. I am looking forward to meeting other students from all over the Americas and working with them to solve some of the most challenging problems."" Jennifer Rosenthal""As the Portuguese Department's Research Assistant on Transitional Justice in Brazil, it's been my job to research and report on how the nation has been recently confronting its military past. This opportunity to pass policy in the Model OAS—as Brazil—to further its Transitional Justice process, is the most exciting application of my research that I could have dreamed of."" Pat Duffy ""I see MOAS as an opportunity to engage with nine other highly motivated Tulane students in working to understand an international democratic organization and the history of Latin American diplomatic relations from the perspective of Brazil. The opportunity to learn from and work with students and peers from all over the hemisphere at the conference in DC is surely a learning experience I will take with me forever, particularly as a student who will be studying abroad in Brazil within the next year."" Tano Trachtenberg ""Participating in Model OAS will give me the opportunity to learn an abundance about modern Brazil and international diplomacy than I would be able to learn in the classroom alone.

 a donation of fixed amount (see the perks on the right)  we offer to the donor an exceptional privilege to 
choose a priority of development.  So, we will spend next month working on the priority you defined.  Of course, we can't promise <i>any</i> thing, so please select from the list below:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Frame-by-frame bitmap animation support (continued, see <a href=""http://wiki.synfig.org/wiki/Dev:Roadmap/Frame-by-frame_animation_%28bitmap%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">current status</a>)</li>
<li>Rendering speed optimization</li>
<li>Sound support</li>
<li>Improve user interface<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>NOTE: We don't guarantee the feature from a selected priority to be <i>completely</i> <i>finished</i>
 within a month. Such promises are not compatible with development 
realities. What we promise is to dedicate no less than 85% of our 
working time to developing this priority for a full month. Though, one 
month is a  significant period and such dedication would lead to 
significant changes in selected direction. Many our users are aware that
 we used to publish <a href=""http://www.synfig.org/cms/en/download/development"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">development snapshots</a> regularly, so you will be able to benefit from development results as soon as possible.</p><p>EXAMPLE: As result of our earlier fundraising campaign, we got sold the ""Choose priority"" perk for October. The priority chosen by donor was ""Single-window UI"". You can see results in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLzkBuNSCVI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this video</a>.</p><h3>""Development OS"" perk</h3><p>By default we use Linux operation system (OS) for daily development (because we love Linux). As result, the Linux version of Synfig is the most polished, because it goes through daily proof.</p><p>But, for a fixed-amount donation (see the perks on the right) you can make us shift to other OS for next month. So, if we will use the OS of your choice in our daily development, then obviously  the Synfig version will be especially polished to work on it: daily proof =&gt; more testing =&gt; less bugs =&gt; better stability.</p><p>No worries, this perk doesn't mean we drop support for other operation systems. It's just a question of choosing the OS for daily development.<br/><br/>At the moment the only OS available for choice is <b>Windows</b>.</p>

I recently graduated with a B.A. in International Studies with the hopes of working with international nonprofits. Recently, I was invited to go to a conference in Washington D.C. and present a research project I worked on while I was in school alongside one of my professors. This campaign will help fund this amazing opportunity to meet people who are influential in the Political Science field and with whom I would love to work some day.</p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The conference I plan to attend is the APSA Annual Meeting &amp; Exhibition. The American Political Science Association is an international network that connects scholars from all over the world. It encourages the sharing of ideas and solutions about current issues. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Pamela. I recently graduated with a B.A. in International Studies with the hopes of working with international nonprofits. Recently, I was invited to go to a conference in Washington D.C. and present a research project I worked on while I was in school alongside one of my professors. This campaign will help fund this amazing opportunity to meet people who are influential in the Political Science field and with whom I would love to work some day.
  The Impact The conference I plan to attend is the APSA Annual Meeting & Exhibition. The American Political Science Association is an international network that connects scholars from all over the world. It encourages the sharing of ideas and solutions about current issues. 
For me, this is an incredible opportunity. I will be able to meet the experts and learn from them. I can ask questions and challenge opinions.

They are tech-savvy and have the skills and comfort with technology beyond most adults today.  For youth growing up in economically challenged areas, facing the high costs of college, the challenging job market, or youth dealing with mental health issues such as autism, ADHD and depression, the future can look bleak.  But the power of hope and opportunity has a tremendous impact on changing the dynamic, and while m</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ost businesses aren't setup to manage large groups of youth employees, <b><i>we are and exclusively hire 14-25 year olds!</i></b> </span></p>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>Supporting Youth Like Mom &amp; Dad Would</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>As a group of parents, aunts and uncles, we've built a technology services company that aims to change the dynamic facing today's youth, harness their untapped skills and revolutionize what business and youth employees can achieve.  If you think it, we can do it.</p>
<p>From the start, we've considered what, when, why and how to provide youth with best environment to succeed, earning us the moniker of being ""Office Mom &amp; Dad"".  Our patent pending model provides youth with the opportunity to work from home, gain work experience, learn life skills and help set aside funds for future higher learning regardless of where they are located.  Where youth come to us with autism or other challenges, we embrace the opportunity to integrate them into YP-IT and provide an environment that maximizes their skills and potential. </p>
<p>In our short existence, we've garnering tremendous interest from businesses wanting to make a difference, empower youth and get some of their needed work done.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Our Youth"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://yp-it.com/YPIT/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kids_collage.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Our Youth""/></p>
<h2>What Your Help Means</h2>
<p>For youth: </p>
<ul>
<li>Valuable work experience and insight into different careers</li>
<li>Paid salary and a contribution to a post-secondary education savings fund</li>
<li>An environment that supports their strengths to help gain confidence in their abilities and preparation for their future career </li>
<li>Teach life lessons in areas such as financial literacy and business acumen that are needed to succeed in today's world </li>
</ul>
<p>For businesses: </p>
<ul>
<li>High-quality technical services for work that needs to be completed but seems too burdensome to tackle </li>
<li>Access to digital content instead of warehouses of paper files that don't yield real information</li>
<li>Better prepared new recruits and access to a well-trained young workforce</li>
</ul>
<p>For society: </p>
<ul>
<li>YP-IT contributes to a school technology fund for every hour worked by a student, thus each student actually helps to support improving the technology within their school</li>
<li>Students are more aware of career options and come out of school with just that amount less debt</li>
<li>Youth are better stewards of their future by learning about budgeting, credit scores and how lives are impacted by a lack of financial literacy</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Help Us Get To 200!</h2>
<p>The initial interest from companies has been great and so we want to ramp up our systems to support more students and handle larger projects.  We are looking to raise $50,000.  Your help will allow us to add servers so that more youth can work simultaneously.  This will help expand the number of youth we can take on throughout the USA and Canada to 200 youth employees!!  </p>
<h3>Our Unique Perks</h3>
<p>We've come up with a number of unique perks that we believe give those interested in showing their support for the youth of today something that can really help them make their mark.  These include (subject to approval):</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the naming rights to the technology fund donation going to your son or daughter's school for two (2) or four (4) years</li>
<li>Become a Youth Ambassador or Champion and have your name and/or company logo displayed on our website </li>
<li>Join the YP-IT Founders Wall and have your name and/or company logo included in all our announcements for three (3) years</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>We understand no everyone can help financially, but there are plenty of other ways you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look around your office and identify documents to digitize, data to entry or other work that could be shared and make your company more productive</li>
<li>Share our campaign with everyone you know and get them to share the news</li>
<li>Like us on Facebook and share our news with your friends</li>

For society: 

YP-IT contributes to a school technology fund for every hour worked by a student, thus each student actually helps to support improving the technology within their school
Students are more aware of career options and come out of school with just that amount less debt
Youth are better stewards of their future by learning about budgeting, credit scores and how lives are impacted by a lack of financial literacy




Help Us Get To 200!
The initial interest from companies has been great and so we want to ramp up our systems to support more students and handle larger projects.  We are looking to raise $50,000.  Your help will allow us to add servers so that more youth can work simultaneously.  This will help expand the number of youth we can take on throughout the USA and Canada to 200 youth employees!!  
Our Unique Perks
We've come up with a number of unique perks that we believe give those interested in showing their support for the youth of today something that can really help them make their mark.  These include (subject to approval):

Get the naming rights to the technology fund donation going to your son or daughter's school for two (2) or four (4) years
Become a Youth Ambassador or Champion and have your name and/or company logo displayed on our website 
Join the YP-IT Founders Wall and have your name and/or company logo included in all our announcements for three (3) years

<li><p><b>For Students:</b> The most fun career exploration resource. To be used in conjunction with other career guidance tools. Ensures that you are able to make an informed decision about direction you wish to follow after leaving school . This keeps student debt down as there is less chance of direction changes at college or university, and allows you to get into the workforce sooner.</p></li>
<li><p><b>For Parents:</b> Ensures that your child doesn't change direction while at college or university, or even drop out AFTER you have invested half of your life savings in their studies.

means professes to have the magic bullet to fix all the challenges that our workforce is facing, but we do have the recipe to engage youth in the career
exploration process. Which is a crucial first step. After all, it is not possible for someone to follow a
career path they don’t know exists…. Did you know that if you were searching
for a career you could become an unexploded ordinance technician, a
geographic information system (GIS) practitioner, or a urine
farmer (seriously!). And that's only the tip of the iceberg!

Our career wiki, CareerCrate, when fully developed, will provide videos of expert insights into jobs ranging from the unknown to traditional careers that everyone has heard of. By leveraging the general public as well as our corporate partners and professional associations to upload videos about all sorts of careers, we will build a wiki with tens of thousands of videos. Using the existing site only as a structural template, we will RE-BRAND and EXPAND
We will draw students onto CareerCrate with crazy humor, contests, and things they find fun.
And once they are there, we will capture and keep their attention with informational career content that will be intriguing and presented in a way that they relate to.

As much as it has already achieved, we believe CareerCrate has the potential to go much, much further! We want to expand our wiki to hold tens of thousands of career videos. We want  to reach out to millions more students than we are currently doing, with much more content, loads of fun, and all sorts of things that will engage them so they keep on coming back for more. Currently, career exploration is seen to be boring. Believing as we do that career exploration can be exciting, our aim is to completely change this perception.Your contributions will be be used for:Staffing: Engaging the staff needed to run CareerCrate at its full potential
Content Development: Produce more of our own movies.
And mostly, more Marketing and Advertising:


To increase our visibility in order to achieve more video submissions for the wiki from the public, businesses and professional associations. We want CareerCrate to be bursting at the seams with videos about every career imaginable. 




To raise awareness about our site among people engaged in career exploration, as well as their parents, teachers and guidance counsellors.

For Students: The most fun career exploration resource. To be used in conjunction with other career guidance tools. Ensures that you are able to make an informed decision about direction you wish to follow after leaving school . This keeps student debt down as there is less chance of direction changes at college or university, and allows you to get into the workforce sooner.
For Parents: Ensures that your child doesn't change direction while at college or university, or even drop out AFTER you have invested half of your life savings in their studies. Also ensures that you don’t have to endure your child lazing around the house for a year after finishing school, groaning that they don’t know what to do with their life.
For Teachers, Guidance Councellors, Librarians and Career Professionals: A formidable tool to add to your array of career resources.
For Professional Associations and Unions: A very focused platform to advocate for the career types that you represent, and to advertise what you can offer members.
For Schools, Colleges and Universities: A highly targeted website to promote your institution and highlight courses and programs you offer.
For Businesses: A highly targeted website to promote yourself as an employer of choice, detail your company culture and the incentives you offer to employees. To promote those careers where you are currently experiencing or expect to experience workforce shortages. Also to employ people who KNOW what their career path is, thereby increasing workforce retention.
For the General Public: Cut down on how much of your hard earned Tax dollars are being wasted on education that is not being completed, and cut down on prices being passed down to you as a consumer from businesses having to re-employ and retrain workers after their predecessors change careers.

<h3>About Me/About <i>BAM</i><br/>
</h3>
<p>I'm Stacey Rippner. Last spring I started thinking about how I might help kids without many books in their homes build their home libraries. I came up with a free book a month idea which I am calling <i>BAM</i>. <i>BAM</i> stands for Book a Month.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After much consideration I decided to try this program with a group of first graders, to test it out. My hope is to turn this idea into something bigger in the future, involving many more children ages 5-10. Money raised through this <i>Indiegogo</i> campaign will enable all 77 of the first graders at <i>Citizens Academy</i> <a href=""http://www.citizensacademy.org/campuses/citizens-academy-10118-hampden-road-cleveland-oh-44108/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.citizensacademy.org/campuses/citizen...</a> to receive a new picture book in the mail every month for six months.<i> Citizens Academy</i> is an urban school in Cleveland where I tutor part time. Jen Taylor, <i>Citizens Academy's</i> principal, is excited about this project and so am I.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have been a teacher for the past twenty years in Chicago, Burlington, Vermont and Cleveland. I've worked in schools and as a private tutor. Last year I shared a hilarious picture book called <i>No David</i> (by David Shannon) with a first grader I was tutoring. He loved the book so much and asked to read it each time we met. I realized it was a book he should own. That thought led me to the idea of starting <i>BAM</i>. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/82368/files/20130918132136-BAM-color.jpg?1379535696"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How Much I Need to Raise </h3>
<p>I need to raise $10,080.00 on Indiegogo to cover the cost of books, mailing supplies, postage and Indiegogo campaign costs. My son (Ruben), my husband (Dan) and my dad (Paul) will be my volunteer <i>BAM</i> helpers. Each month a new title will be selected and mailed to the homes of the<i> Citizens Academy</i> first graders.<br/></p>
<p>Any donation will help. The Indiegogo donation process is easy with a credit card. Please donate and be part of great books entering the homes of first graders in Cleveland, Ohio. <br/></p>
<p>If the idea of helping kids build their home libraries is not enough to make you want to give, consider this. A twenty year study from The University of Nevada illustrates that children raised in a home with lots of books have more of a chance of academic success later in life, regardless of the family's income. Click on the following link to read about that study <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100520213116.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100520213116.htm</a> . <br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>For those of you interested in special perks, I have a few.<br/></p>
<h4>$150.00 Donation -- Signed Copy of <i>The Lonely Phone Booth</i>  </h4>
<p></p>
<ul><li>My talented writer friend Peter Ackerman, donated 20 signed copies of his fun and funny picture book, <i>The Lonely Phone Booth</i>, about one of the last phone booths in NYC. A signed copy can be your for a $150.00 donation. This will be one of the six books students receive.<br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<h4>$75.00 Donation -- <i>Grab a Book Bot </i>(Original Art on a Domino)</h4>
<p></p>
<ul><li>And... another dear, talented artist friend, Gary Hirsch, who grew up in Cleveland, but now lives in Portland, Oregon, has generously designed and donated his one of a kind domino ""Grab a Book"" Bots. Bots is short for robots. Contributors of $75.00 will receive one of Gary's original Bots. Each of these small treasures is hand drawn on a domino. These unique pieces of artwork are sold on Etsy, but the “Grab a Book"" Bot is brand new, designed with <i>BAM</i> in mind.<br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<h4><b>$50.00 Donation -- BAM Book/Shopping Bag</b></h4>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<i>BAM </i>book/shopping bags will be sent to people who donate $50.00. The fun <i>BAM </i>logo, a robot taking a book out of a mailbox is featured at the top of my <i>Indiegogo </i>page and was also designed by Gary Hirsch.<br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Don't Want a Perk?</h4>
<p>I realize that some of you do not care about receiving a perk. Once you click on the amount you want to donate you will be asked whether you want to change the perk. If you don't want the perk, simply click on “Change the Perk"". </p>

I'm Stacey Rippner. Last spring I started thinking about how I might help kids without many books in their homes build their home libraries. I came up with a free book a month idea which I am calling BAM. BAM stands for Book a Month.

After much consideration I decided to try this program with a group of first graders, to test it out. My hope is to turn this idea into something bigger in the future, involving many more children ages 5-10. Money raised through this Indiegogo campaign will enable all 77 of the first graders at Citizens Academy http://www.citizensacademy.org/campuses/citizen... to receive a new picture book in the mail every month for six months. Citizens Academy is an urban school in Cleveland where I tutor part time. Jen Taylor, Citizens Academy's principal, is excited about this project and so am I.

I have been a teacher for the past twenty years in Chicago, Burlington, Vermont and Cleveland. I've worked in schools and as a private tutor. Last year I shared a hilarious picture book called No David (by David Shannon) with a first grader I was tutoring. He loved the book so much and asked to read it each time we met. I realized it was a book he should own. That thought led me to the idea of starting BAM. 





How Much I Need to Raise 
I need to raise $10,080.00 on Indiegogo to cover the cost of books, mailing supplies, postage and Indiegogo campaign costs. My son (Ruben), my husband (Dan) and my dad (Paul) will be my volunteer BAM helpers. Each month a new title will be selected and mailed to the homes of the Citizens Academy first graders.
Any donation will help. The Indiegogo donation process is easy with a credit card. Please donate and be part of great books entering the homes of first graders in Cleveland, Ohio. 
If the idea of helping kids build their home libraries is not enough to make you want to give, consider this. A twenty year study from The University of Nevada illustrates that children raised in a home with lots of books have more of a chance of academic success later in life, regardless of the family's income. Click on the following link to read about that study http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100520213116.htm . 
Perks
To learn about perks you can receive for donating, watch the following video and read the info. below.


For those of you interested in special perks, I have a few.
$150.00 Donation -- Signed Copy of The Lonely Phone Booth  

My talented writer friend Peter Ackerman, donated 20 signed copies of his fun and funny picture book, The Lonely Phone Booth, about one of the last phone booths in NYC. A signed copy can be your for a $150.00 donation. This will be one of the six books students receive.


$75.00 Donation -- Grab a Book Bot (Original Art on a Domino)

And... another dear, talented artist friend, Gary Hirsch, who grew up in Cleveland, but now lives in Portland, Oregon, has generously designed and donated his one of a kind domino ""Grab a Book"" Bots. Bots is short for robots. Contributors of $75.00 will receive one of Gary's original Bots. Each of these small treasures is hand drawn on a domino. These unique pieces of artwork are sold on Etsy, but the “Grab a Book"" Bot is brand new, designed with BAM in mind.


$50.00 Donation -- BAM Book/Shopping Bag


BAM book/shopping bags will be sent to people who donate $50.00. The fun BAM logo, a robot taking a book out of a mailbox is featured at the top of my Indiegogo page and was also designed by Gary Hirsch.



Don't Want a Perk?
I realize that some of you do not care about receiving a perk. Once you click on the amount you want to donate you will be asked whether you want to change the perk. If you don't want the perk, simply click on “Change the Perk"". 
Another Way You Can Help
If you are live in the Cleveland area and are interested in volunteering for BAM, please contact me.

<p>My name is Bethany Evans and I am in 7th grade at Evergreen Community Charter School.  I have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to go on a service learning trip with a group of students and teachers from my middle school. I don't usually get a chance to travel ANYWHERE.  This is a <em>huge </em>opportunity for me. I will go and learn about the culture and meet people and do service.  I really want to go because I've always wanted to travel to interesting places.  Ghana, Africa is one of the most interesting places I can think of.</p>
<p>Here is our group's web site and it tells a lot about the trip: <a href=""http://www.goingtoghana.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.goingtoghana.org</a></p>
<h3>What We Are Raising</h3>
<p>Our whole trip will cost about $4,000 (including airline tickets, lodging, medicine for malaria, and everything else).  My parents and I have already helped raise about 75% of the total through individual and group fundraising (with the other students' families)!  There is still some group fundraising planned, but I need to raise another $750 to be able to go.</p>
<p>(Originally, we thought the group fundraising would be a little higher, but the group had some problems, like having to cancel our biggest fundraiser due to an insurance issue.  But we HAVE raised a lot by having a school dance, raking a lot of leaves all over town, throwing an African Arts night, and getting some nice donations.)</p>
<p>If you can contribute to the $750 I still need, it would be so awesome!  The final payment is due at the end of February and the trip starts on March 23.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is from the Going to Ghana website.  It tells why this trip is so important to me: <a href=""http://www.goingtoghana.org/bethany.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.goingtoghana.org/bethany.html</a></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are two more fundraisers for the whole group.  Once is a local music concert on February 17 at White Horse Black Mountain, called Malcolm Holcombe and Friends: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/203925919750291/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/events/203925919750291/?fref=ts</a></p>
<p>The second is that we are raffling off this amazing quilt made by one of the students' grandmothers.  It's even more beautiful in real life.  Tickets are only $5.  <a href=""http://www.goingtoghana.org/amazing-quilt-raffle.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.goingtoghana.org/amazing-quilt-raffle.html</a></p>

<p>
</p>
<p>In 2010, we were asked by Amchi Namgyal Rinpoche, current president of
the Himalayan Amchi Association (HAA), to assist him and the communities in
Dolpo, Nepal, to start a school for Tibetan medicine in the Tarap Valley, high
in the Himalaya.</p>
<p>The people in this region

training in Tibetan medicine to local community members in the region.</p>

<div><br/></div>
<p>My name is Hanitra and I am an artist from Madagascar.  I have been working as a musician and toured around the world for almost 22 years playing music from my country. I have made 12 albums and my music is used in more than 10 films.</p>
<p>Time Magazine pronounced my band to be one of the ten best bands on the planet<br/>Promoting, preserving traditional music, arts and culture is my main focus to empower people.</p>
<p><span><span>In May 2011, I got myself involved in an environmental project to preserve Madagascar's unique fauna and flora and launched a platform called Artists &amp; Environment to encourage artists  of all different backgrounds and disciplines to take part in motivating people to act against the degradation of the environment.</span></span></p>
<p>Last April 2014, Warner Brothers released a documentary film called <i>Island of lemurs</i> - a beautiful film that portrays the life of lemurs, which my music has been used in. The film was made by IMAX production and it features Mr. Morgan Freeman as the narrator of the documentary. I encourage you to go out and see it.<br/></p>

<p><span>Inspired by Arts Centres in Great Britain, I built the first ever Malagasy Arts Centre <i>Antshow Madagascar</i> in the capital of Antananarivo and am now embarking on building a one-stop Eco Mud House to be used as a cultural, environmental and social meeting place in a rural area called: Fenoarivo, Soavinandriana district, in the region of Itasy. The house will be built entirely with locally sourced materials with no machinery involved. Environmentally friendly, the house is to be a model home for the local countryside people to copy from.</span></p>

<p><span>This is very important to me because in our country, tradition, arts and cultural heritage are disappearing and our environment is degrading. People of rural areas are the guardians of tradition and building the Eco Mud House will be able to bring the community together. Re-learning old building techniques, there will be a transfer of knowledge from old to young. The house will be used for so many purposes focusing on educational, social and environmental issues. It will encourage the exchange from urban to rural living, local to international and vice versa.</span></p>

Our main aim is to develop rural tourism in this area for which the Eco Mud House will also be used.</span></div>

The two-storey mud-house will follow exactly the traditional Malagasy way of building in the highlands of Madagascar.

Make malagasy country men proud to show off their traditional house building skills.

  Risks & Challenges  
Destruction of the environment like cutting down the forests, erosion, water problems, lack of schools, sanitary and basic infrastructure and simply being so remote are some of the risks and challenges we are facing while building this one-stop Eco Mud House. 
Having started with nothing myself and now ending up being a great ambassador of Madagascar's music, culture and environmental projects, I want to challenge this. 
The community of Fenoarivo is a very hard working community who are eager to learn and meet new people. Their land is fertile and the landscape is beautiful. Everything is there for them to thrive, except that they need a leader and a role model to guide their path to life improvement and success. We can use the Eco Mud House as the heart of their village, which normally no one would want to visit for longer than 2 hours - even myself!

</ul><div><b><br/></b></div><h3><b>What We Need</b></h3>

The Impact
Agog is just one educational tool of many, but it is an important missing piece! We believe the ripple effect of a mobile app like Agog can have a far reaching impact.
Consider how Agog can impact:

Traditional Classrooms
Experimental Classrooms
Online Classrooms
Hybrid Classrooms
Montessori Classes
Cloud based Schools
Home School
Incarcerated Students
Student Teachers
Teaching Assistants
Tutors
Parents
Remedial Reference for Students
Test Preparation
and many more

We believe Agog has application in nearly every imaginable classroom setting.

What People are Saying About Agog



Risks & Challenges
We have tried to keep Agog a low-risk, high-reward for teachers kind of project, but there are always risks and challenges.

Development can take longer than expected.
Development can be more expensive than expected.
Software updates can cause setbacks.
Agog is fast-growing and now has thousands of lesson plans causing general maintenance and tracking of potential spam to be more and more challenging.
We have been told we are ""over-secure"" but that is because we take security risks seriously and we will continue to do so.

We are currently working on launching this application as a  web/mobile software platform with free tools dedicated to the BIO (organic) farmers that will actively manage the rotation plan of the crops in BIO system( just like ""playing organic FarmVille"" but with real data :), and develop premium features with integration of  big data analysis from their geospatial location with the help of a smart sensors kit (all depending on the nature of the crops and the size of the plots and the number of their farm’s animals and type) !(* Note: this is a real screenshot from the prototype you will be able to use if you contribute by donating and/or sharing  (to)the campaign that is actually a custom excel file)The tools will enable the BIO(organic) farmer to:

What the organic farmers say about the product?Alexandru DUMBRAVA:      www.biodumbrava.ro
” Being able to run multiple scalable income/productivity scenarios with real data and compare their output is probably the greatest unfair advantage a small business can have in order to achieve  product market fit based on their own resources, I found the BIO FARMING  MANAGER to be a great and useful tool for my business! ”


What We Need & What You Get Basically we need a min. budget of 15.000$ seed money to get us started with the infrastructure of the platform for the tools developed so far (that reflect a 2 years sum of countless hours of R&D-(Research and Development)) and ensure enough budget for running the platform and finance the R&D for the premium features in order for the project to selfsustain itself. 


You get to use in advance our existing desktop prototype that gives you a competitive advantage and will accelerate your knowledge and understanding of organic farming and its business potential !

Back-end preview of the prototype ...

The future platform will enable the users to get access to the  tools online, and  will give a step by step guidance by helping the organic farmers achieve product-market fit related to their own resources and enable them through its specific structure to create their own database in order for the tools to be more accurate by  establishing  a build/measure/learn practical routine that is essential to any     start-up.



  The Impact This project has 3 main objectives:

 increasing the social impact of organic farmers and helping them achieve sustainable growth by providing them online tools that will help them manage their own small business and increase productivity and profits(by creating a win/win situation : the more money they make -the more money we make ... :)
decreasing the high unemployment percentage (%) rate in the rural communities by encouraging people to start their own small agriculture business farms 

educate people about the benefits of agroecology (in terms of humans health with benefits on cancer prevention, social health in terms of the economy-generating self employed people or small business owners, and planet health in terms of reducing the carbon footprint with sustainable agricultural practices).



  Risks & Challenges  As we all know no business plan/income projection survives first contact with customers/market, but that doesn't mean we can't keep an open mind about iterating our model until the suitable solution replaces our initial estimation and generates an acceptable percentage (%) of error in our plan. So our future struggle will focus on:

educating the organic farmers about the benefits of proper planning (plan A/B/C+contingency-crop insurance and/or mutual funds) and taking ""educated guesses"" with the help of our tools rather than using a magic crystall ball and blame the results on the economy ensuring product market fit for the premium features (so that their added value to the free tools will generate 10+ times  the value and then some :) for the investment of the organic farmers).

</div></div>","Families in Somalia Need Homes and Clean Water
Since 1981, Somalia has been wracked with constant and ongoing civil war and unrest. Today, thousands of women and children are living in transient camps - sleeping in tents.
Imagine for a moment a rail thin young boy walking to his tent with a gallon bucket filled with water. When he arrives at his tent, he gives the water to his mother and siblings who are clinging to life - as they lack food, clean drinking water and medical care they need.
Unfortunately for this young boy and his family, this is daily life in Somalia. They don't know a different, safer and more fulfilling life. For them, there is no way out. When basic human needs go unmet, all other thoughts cease to exist. 
Havoyoco was founded in 1992 to address the basic needs of women and children in Somalia. Our mission is to provide basic human needs so the people of Somalia can develop the education, skills and ambition needed to help themselves out of poverty.
Our goal is to build homes for 120 families, dig two deep water wells to provide clean drinking water for these families, and to build a medical center and school. Our focus is to transform the lives of families, so they can enjoy basic human dignity and begin to think about opportunities to create a better future for themselves.

Funding Goal

 We need funds to build a community for 120 families.  
Each home will cost $7,000 to build ($7,000 x 120 homes = $840,000) Construction on the homes will begin in January 2015 and be finished in Decemeber 2015.
The medical clinic, school and deep water wells will cost $600,000.
The construction of the clinic, school and wells will begin in July 2016 and be complete by January 2018.
In January 2016, we will begin interviewing qualified families to begin filling the community and providing families with immediate access to permanent living accommodations. 
Contributions to HAVOYOCO are deemed charitable under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3). U.S. Federal Tax ID 46-0745266. Please consult your accountant for any clarications.

I'm a tech evangelist with many years experience working at a local cyber cafe. More than anything, I'm passionate about open source computing and the doors it can open for my community in Bamenda.</p><p>The cyber cafe is being sold and I have a great opportunity to ensure that the space is best utilized to empower the local community. With your help, I can purchase the facility and make it an open source cyber learning center to provide skills training to many people in the community, including many people who have few opportunities to get high quality training.</p><p></p><p><b>Update: With days remaining for this campaign, the initial goal is likely out
 of reach but that doesn't mean we can't use additional support from 
your networks as we have a few exciting developments to mention.<br/></b></p><p><b>In fact, Stephan has strengthened his relationship with the current owner 
of the cyber café who is willing to sell the space for less than anticipated - 1.75 million 
CFA (roughly US $3,700). In other words, the owner has agreed to sell the business and 
building under an installment plan that is $2,500 less than initially thought.</b></p><ul>
<li><b>The 1<sup>st</sup> 500 000 CFA (US $1,050) was paid on 18 Mar 2014 (last week) signifying the transfer of responsibility of the business. This is a great step forward!<br/></b></li>

</blockquote>Empowerment is about having the ability to use knowledge, to make decisions on your own behalf, and to improve the society. In today's world, computing skills are crucial. We are making Cameroon into an information society and a regional leader in ICT business and tech incubation. Training centers in the area currently act as ""train and go"" rather than ""train and grow."" Many people are reluctant to come in.

</blockquote><p></p>Our vision is that community empowerment can happen through the use low-cost computers and free software. Specifically, we are proposing an innovative, community-based and community-driven information and communication center that emphasizes the importance of using a wide range of technologies for critical thinking. It will make a significant contribution to building a more inclusive society. The center will cater to all groups, including people who are poor, disabled, or marginalized for other reasons. In short, it will address the diverse needs of the majority of the people in the Bamenda region.<br/><br/><p><b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Here's why we need it:</span></b><br/></p><p></p><p>In developing countries, most workers earn a living through agriculture or domestic service. A living wage is hard to come by. Poor infrastructure makes it difficult to create new jobs. Fortunately, the Internet is changing the cycle of poverty as people are able to develop skills that allow them to create new forms of business that tie-in with the global economy.<br/></p><p></p><p>Mobile phones are common in the North West region of Cameroon but few young people have an environment whether they can learn useful computer skills. Schools lack an ICT curriculum and most cyber cafes do not provide training. Few Cameroonians know how to use a computer to find a job, launch their own business, or learn about the world. </p><p>There are several groups of people who could benefit from a more socially oriented model of computer based learning and employment. People who are poor and vulnerable are particularly affected, but also have strengths and opportunities.

I'm a tech evangelist with many years experience working at a local cyber cafe. More than anything, I'm passionate about open source computing and the doors it can open for my community in Bamenda.The cyber cafe is being sold and I have a great opportunity to ensure that the space is best utilized to empower the local community. With your help, I can purchase the facility and make it an open source cyber learning center to provide skills training to many people in the community, including many people who have few opportunities to get high quality training.Update: With days remaining for this campaign, the initial goal is likely out
 of reach but that doesn't mean we can't use additional support from 
your networks as we have a few exciting developments to mention.In fact, Stephan has strengthened his relationship with the current owner 
of the cyber café who is willing to sell the space for less than anticipated - 1.75 million 
CFA (roughly US $3,700). In other words, the owner has agreed to sell the business and 
building under an installment plan that is $2,500 less than initially thought.
The 1st 500 000 CFA (US $1,050) was paid on 18 Mar 2014 (last week) signifying the transfer of responsibility of the business. This is a great step forward!
The 2nd 750 000 CFA (US $1,600) will be paid by 18 June
2014 (3 months from now).
The 3rd 500 000 CFA (US $1,050) will be paid by 18 Sept
2014 (6 months from now) upon which will result the transfer of the property through deed of
sale.
We are not sure how the next couple of months will proceed, but all funds raised from here out will go toward the June 18th payment for the cyber café. An offline campaign is also in progress to raise awareness for the need to fund Marc Stephan's dream to empower the community of Bamenda.Introduction""The child destined to invent the next version of the internet could be without a computer right now. We need to change that."" - Ken Starks, Reglue.org
Empowerment is about having the ability to use knowledge, to make decisions on your own behalf, and to improve the society. In today's world, computing skills are crucial. We are making Cameroon into an information society and a regional leader in ICT business and tech incubation. Training centers in the area currently act as ""train and go"" rather than ""train and grow."" Many people are reluctant to come in. Users may learn to surf the Internet or use social media but they do not stay to learn lifelong knowledge. Better access to information means developing abilities to solve problems facing society. Computer education builds self-esteem and can be a great outlet for creativity and teamwork.Youth using computers at the cafeBackground""What the whole world wants is a good job."" - Jim Clifton, Gallup CEO
Our vision is that community empowerment can happen through the use low-cost computers and free software. Specifically, we are proposing an innovative, community-based and community-driven information and communication center that emphasizes the importance of using a wide range of technologies for critical thinking. It will make a significant contribution to building a more inclusive society. The center will cater to all groups, including people who are poor, disabled, or marginalized for other reasons. In short, it will address the diverse needs of the majority of the people in the Bamenda region.Here's why we need it:In developing countries, most workers earn a living through agriculture or domestic service. A living wage is hard to come by. Poor infrastructure makes it difficult to create new jobs. Fortunately, the Internet is changing the cycle of poverty as people are able to develop skills that allow them to create new forms of business that tie-in with the global economy.Mobile phones are common in the North West region of Cameroon but few young people have an environment whether they can learn useful computer skills. Schools lack an ICT curriculum and most cyber cafes do not provide training. Few Cameroonians know how to use a computer to find a job, launch their own business, or learn about the world. There are several groups of people who could benefit from a more socially oriented model of computer based learning and employment. People who are poor and vulnerable are particularly affected, but also have strengths and opportunities. In developing nations like Cameroon, youth (those under 30), women, people living with disabilities and chronic illnesses are often seeking employment but face discrimination and disproportionately high unemployment rates.Women are welcomed with open arms to use the cafeSome people have never had the opportunity to use a computer, and now don’t have the courage to enter an internet cafe. Many others, who do have the courage to come to a cybercafe, don't even have basic understandings of computers and the internet. Those who do come and do research on a topic (usually related to what they do offline) are expecting the internet, through a search engine, to give them the answer. Unfortunately, when they don't find the kind of answer they were hoping for, they feel reluctant to come next time.From these observations, we have seen the need to create a safe and inclusive space for people to admit they don’t know about computers so they can learn more.In an ideal educational system, these people would have acquired the skills they need to be comfortable with the internet and computers at school and at home as they grow up. Unfortunately, the education system in developing countries such as Cameroon’s is not adequate. There are many youth who went to professional training centers but who fail to translate their learning into jobs. This group could also be useful mentors and trainers to those who are just learning about ICT.In addition, there is a group of people who have learned extensive ICT skills on their own in informal environments but who cannot leverage their knowledge, because they don't have any certificate to demonstrate what they know. This lack of credential precludes them from obtaining better jobs. There is a need for a competency-based certificate program that would assist this group to move into jobs in the ICT and related sectors. This new community based/social business will address these needs and opportunities.What's neededOnce the physical space is purchased under an installment plan (1 750 000 CFA, or US $3,700), the need will be to fill it with the right tools to train the local community. Though the current HP desktop computers in the cyber cafe will be sold with the business, they are aging fast and are not energy-efficient by today's standards. The furniture will remain, as it is still suitable to a computer learning center.Current computers at the cafe will be upgradedThe primary cost of equipment will be versatile single-board computers. To save money, they will connect to the current hardware in the cyber cafe and will run Linux. A list of the current cyber cafe's inventory can be found on Google Drive.All supplies and equipment to be purchased include:
10 Arduino or Kano computer board starter kits as they are among the cheapest computers in the world (in terms of both immediate and long-term cost) and come with accessories. They will be purchased in the U.S. and shipped to Cameroon. $75-100 each. ($750-$1000 + $150 estimated shipping = $900-$1150)

games. We intend to keep access to the

to grow into a place where someone can come to play games, create games either

<h2><b>Learn to Code by Playing a Game</b></h2>
<p>The best way to learn
a new computer language or technology is to look at what others have done.
BotWorkshop is designed from the ground up for sharing and collaboration. Work your way through guides and challenges, ask questions in the forums and share your own ideas. All site resources, aside from tutoring, are available for free.</p>
<p>We recognize that not
everyone, especially kids, can fully benefit from self-directed learning. We
are creating an e-learning platform that enables students to take classes
within the BotWorkshop environment.  Teachers will help students complete guides and challenges covering topics ranging from
coding to computer science, math to artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Looking for a fun way to introduce your child to the joys and challenges of coding?  BotWorkshop classes are a great way to keep kids interested and engaged as they solve problems and build their own bots.</p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We anticipate that our classes will cost $15/session with multi-session discounts.</b><br/></p>

Tutor students one-on-one or teach small classes.  Monitor students’ progress and give them feedback in class or via your own private class forum.</p><p>You can use teaching guides created by community members, or create your own guides.  Topics are only limited by your imagination.</p><p>The BotWorkshop platform provides a straightforward object model that can be used “out of the box” for a variety of challenges (for example, handling events, solving mazes, herding ducks, etc.).  If you need something more extensive (soccer anyone?), the open source platform is completely extensible.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/284280/files/20131230125542-create_guides.png?1388436942"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>Make a Difference</h2><p></p><p>We think the BotWorkshop platform is pretty cool and are excited about the prospect of connecting students and teachers. However, we recognize that not every eager student can afford to pay for a class. To help remedy this, we plan on devoting a percentage of our revenue (we're aiming for 5%) to make tutoring and classes freely available to underserved kids.</p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We plan on incorporating BotWorkshop as a California Flexible Purpose Corporation. In a nutshell, a Flexible Purpose Corporation can state a ""special purpose"" in its charter that is different from making money for its shareholders.  Our purpose will be to provide educational resources to underserved kids.</span><br/></p><p></p><p>Although not every kid is interested in learning to code, we want to help educate as many kids as possible, regardless of economic resources.</p><h2>The BotWorkshop Team</h2><p>Dave Klein has been coding since the late 70's.  He cut his teeth writing BASIC programs for the Apple II and was a professional software developer for over 14 years. Dave co-founded AbilityWare, a Web 1.0 personalization company. Although AbilityWare did not set the web world on fire, Dave is quite proud that he was able to make his investors whole at a time when many folks lost a bundle. More recently, Dave has worked as a financial strategist and won the 2013 Wagner Award for Advances in Active Investment Management. Additionally, he co-teaches a C++ course at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. Dave still codes every day, mainly for fun, and wants to share the joy and creativity of coding with folks looking to get started. </p><p>Brian Villmoare also programmed his first games in Apple II BASIC, although Satellite War never did become the hit he had hoped. It was through programming that he found a love of math and statistics that stood him in good stead through graduate school.  Today he is a research paleontologist and university educator and continues to program, most often to model biological systems and quantitative genetics. His experiences teaching programming and statistics, and his desire to get younger students to learn to program, has been one of the influences that led to the creation of BotWorkshop.</p><p>In part, BotWorkshop is the answer to the question of how Dave &amp; Brian would introduce the world of programming to their kids: Jack, Sophia, Margo &amp; Ava.<br/></p><h2>Where We are Now</h2><p>We've completed the web-based development environment and the first cut of our open source game engine.  <strike>We should unleash the platform on beta testers some time in January 2014.</strike>  <b>UPDATE: Our beta is now open at <a href=""http://botworkshop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://botworkshop.com</a>, head on over to kick the tires! </b>We still need to finish up the e-learning platform to allow students and teachers to collaborate on coding sessions. We also need to beef up our server infrastructure and web site to ensure everything scales well.</p><p>If we are funded, we plan on launching in early May (hopefully earlier).</p><h2>Where the Money Goes</h2>
<p></p><p>BotWorkshop started as a labor of love. We were looking for a compelling way to teach our kids about coding and math. As we continued to work on the idea, we realized that other folks would derive value from it is well.  In order to reach full potential, we need to give the project the professional attention it deserves.</p><p>We're raising money to fund:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Continued development of the BotWorkshop game platform</span><br/>

BotWorkshop is designed from the ground up for sharing and collaboration. Work your way through guides and challenges, ask questions in the forums and share your own ideas. All site resources, aside from tutoring, are available for free.
We recognize that not
everyone, especially kids, can fully benefit from self-directed learning. We
are creating an e-learning platform that enables students to take classes
within the BotWorkshop environment.  Teachers will help students complete guides and challenges covering topics ranging from
coding to computer science, math to artificial intelligence.
Looking for a fun way to introduce your child to the joys and challenges of coding?  BotWorkshop classes are a great way to keep kids interested and engaged as they solve problems and build their own bots.We anticipate that our classes will cost $15/session with multi-session discounts.
Teach Others to CodeAre you an experienced coder?  Want to earn money by tutoring others and teaching online classes?  BotWorkshop’s e-learning platform is designed to connect students and teachers. Tutor students one-on-one or teach small classes.  Monitor students’ progress and give them feedback in class or via your own private class forum.You can use teaching guides created by community members, or create your own guides.  Topics are only limited by your imagination.The BotWorkshop platform provides a straightforward object model that can be used “out of the box” for a variety of challenges (for example, handling events, solving mazes, herding ducks, etc.).  If you need something more extensive (soccer anyone?), the open source platform is completely extensible.Make a DifferenceWe think the BotWorkshop platform is pretty cool and are excited about the prospect of connecting students and teachers. However, we recognize that not every eager student can afford to pay for a class. To help remedy this, we plan on devoting a percentage of our revenue (we're aiming for 5%) to make tutoring and classes freely available to underserved kids.We plan on incorporating BotWorkshop as a California Flexible Purpose Corporation. In a nutshell, a Flexible Purpose Corporation can state a ""special purpose"" in its charter that is different from making money for its shareholders.  Our purpose will be to provide educational resources to underserved kids.Although not every kid is interested in learning to code, we want to help educate as many kids as possible, regardless of economic resources.The BotWorkshop TeamDave Klein has been coding since the late 70's.  He cut his teeth writing BASIC programs for the Apple II and was a professional software developer for over 14 years. Dave co-founded AbilityWare, a Web 1.0 personalization company. Although AbilityWare did not set the web world on fire, Dave is quite proud that he was able to make his investors whole at a time when many folks lost a bundle. More recently, Dave has worked as a financial strategist and won the 2013 Wagner Award for Advances in Active Investment Management. Additionally, he co-teaches a C++ course at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business. Dave still codes every day, mainly for fun, and wants to share the joy and creativity of coding with folks looking to get started. Brian Villmoare also programmed his first games in Apple II BASIC, although Satellite War never did become the hit he had hoped. It was through programming that he found a love of math and statistics that stood him in good stead through graduate school.  Today he is a research paleontologist and university educator and continues to program, most often to model biological systems and quantitative genetics. His experiences teaching programming and statistics, and his desire to get younger students to learn to program, has been one of the influences that led to the creation of BotWorkshop.In part, BotWorkshop is the answer to the question of how Dave & Brian would introduce the world of programming to their kids: Jack, Sophia, Margo & Ava.Where We are NowWe've completed the web-based development environment and the first cut of our open source game engine.  We should unleash the platform on beta testers some time in January 2014.  UPDATE: Our beta is now open at http://botworkshop.com, head on over to kick the tires! We still need to finish up the e-learning platform to allow students and teachers to collaborate on coding sessions. We also need to beef up our server infrastructure and web site to ensure everything scales well.If we are funded, we plan on launching in early May (hopefully earlier).Where the Money Goes
BotWorkshop started as a labor of love. We were looking for a compelling way to teach our kids about coding and math. As we continued to work on the idea, we realized that other folks would derive value from it is well.  In order to reach full potential, we need to give the project the professional attention it deserves.We're raising money to fund:

Continued development of the BotWorkshop game platform

Enhancements to the BotWorkshop web site
Beefed up cloud infrastructure 
Legal & accounting fees to ensure we launch properly
Stretch goals include professionally-produced how-to videos, support for more computer languages and creation of a BotWorkshop mobile app.Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you cannot contribute to the campaign, you can still help us out if you believe in our mission.1.

You see,  we think that we have a lot of stressed kids out there and we need to give them the simple tools to help them feel peaceful in this demanding world.  Kids are overstimulated by their environment (food, noise, pollution) whilst become less and less attached to the world through technology of games, phones, computers... It's just about having some balance - living in the world we have created but still able to find a moment of peace to help us and our kids deal with the big stuff life throws at us.  Kids need some peace more than ever.We've been doing this for about 10 years but it is time to step it up a gear and here's where we need your help.What We Need We need funding to help us launch our 2nd book - Connected Kids. It's going to show how we can teach this to kids experiencing Autism, ADHD or who have special needs.  (We've worked with individual families worldwide who are featured in the book, telling their story and showing other parents and educators what they can do).We need funding for...

<p></p>
<p>I am here to be Real with Everyone taking the time to read this: *I* desire to make other's happy because: It Makes My Life Easier. <br/><br/>
We all want our Lives to be Easier and we all Deserve It. <br/><br/>
I got Lucky: I am a naturally very happy person. The video shows this. (Im a little silly too ;))</p>
<p>I had a beautiful childhood and teenage adolescence. I made straight As and knew I was bound for college and long term success at an ""important"" career. <br/><br/>
Then at 17 I developed chronic migraines and that is when I began my Struggle in America. </p>
<p>Once a debilitating medical condition enters one's life, there is not much great parents can do, good grades do not make the pain go away, jobs start avoiding your employment and nothing you plan ever goes according to plan. <br/><br/>
Once one experiences physical pain every day.....one starts to realize what is most important in life:<br/><br/>
After 13 years of struggle, pain, injustice and personal growth I know what is most important to me &amp; I believe I know what is most important to most people:<br/><br/>
Love. Receiving Love. Giving Love. <br/><br/>
The Most Important, Rewarding and Fulfilling Activity in my life and for the last 3 years is spreading a message of Unconditional Love. It makes me Feel Better about My Struggle. It helps me to Accept and Be Strong in the face of Other's Struggle, of the Struggles of the Entire Planet. <br/><br/>
Have you ever wanted to feel less overwhlemed by the negativity of worldly affairs? Do you ever wish you had more control over your fear and anxiety?</p>
<p>I have taken control of my anxiety, my past, my trauma, my disappointments and expectations by passing out this sticker. When I give it a stranger and their face lights up, they smile, they squeal, they jump up and down, they hug me, they high five me, they start to share their strongest emotions, their secrets their fears and anxiety<br/><br/>
I Feel Great. I feel fulfilled. Best of all: I feel ready for Life's Challenges. <br/><br/>
I want to relate to each and every person. I apologize if you cannot relate to the people in our video. I want to ask each of you, FOR FUN, to ignore any judgements and instead keep reading, keep researching our philosophies and pictures and Give it a Try!<br/><br/>
Buy some stickers and see for yourself what happens if you tag them or pass them out. </p>
<p>Don't rely on just my words: take action and prove to yourself if passing out this message makes you feel good. =)<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>

Hello Free Spirits, Non Conformists, Pioneers, Visionaries, Dubious Strangers and Fellow Wayseers! Welcome Professionals, Students, Mothers, Fathers, Leaders and Preachers!
I Don't Know You, But I Love You!
It is true, I mean it, it is tattooed on my arm & I am determined for every human to hear it at least once. Would you like that as well? If so: 
I am super excited to present to You the Opportunity to Spread the Love to those that need it most: 
  <3  Orphans  <3 
Please allow me to introduce myself by my nick name, Charlizzle Blizzle. 
There is much I could say about myself, but I would rather you watch The Video: Because what is most important is not who I am but how I make you feel: my energy, how my smile makes you feel, if there is sincerity in my voice, if I get you EXCITED.
I am here to give you confidence in donating to a simple and complex, abstract idea: I believe passing out a sticker that says, ""I Don't Know You, But I Love You"" is a method for Ending Racism. 
If racism was not largely present in society’s judgments & governments’ decision making, surely The People would be able to quickly unite together as One. This sticker is a method for Uniting as One in an Extremely Exhilarating and Electrifying way!So Start S.W.W.Sing Everyday People! 
S.W.W.S = Saving the World With Stickers! I can prove how this is so but I like Fun A LOT and what is more Fun at this moment is to now talk about how the sticker makes people feel. Even if you do not believe or understand how the sticker Ends Racism, it most certainly Makes People Very Happy. It Changes Lives. That is what I care most about: 
Making Others Feel As Good As I Do on a Daily Basis.
Reactions to Receiving the Sticker:
*Speechlessness *Huge Smile *Involuntary Squeal *Jumping *High-Fiving *Hugging *Cheering *Demand for More Stickers *Tears of Joy * Looks of Love
If this sounds like your type of activity Buy Some Stickers!
Experience these reactions from your gifting or tagging AND!Feel the Love & Appreciation from across the world as young children and teenagers receive this message, perhaps some for the first time. Imagine what that reaction is like, imagine how it will feel.

<p>The town needed to do something to honor them, console their families, and reach out and pay tribute to the countless veterans who have served our great country. </p>
<p>Smithville, TX (population 3,817), decided to build a park. A place to pay tribute... A place to pray for peace...</p>
<p>The centerpiece is a 15-foot tall angel sculpted by world-renowned and local resident Bill McGlaun, which is dedicated to seven brave service members in all who made the ultimate sacrifice between 2006 and 2011, and to their family and friends who remain.</p>
<p>Other areas in the park are dedicated to the veterans from every era since the Texas Revolution in 1836. Plaques are up for over 1,000 veterans already, with more planned for about another 4,000.</p>
<p>We have been able to fund almost all of the park with the resources we have – time, labor, materials, some money… what’s left is the cost of the foundry for the angel. We need to raise about $60,000 to get the angel off the ground. Please help us!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact of your Gift</strong></p>
<p>This park will be a place for the grieving to find solace, a place for children to learn about our history, and a place that pays an important tribute to the men and women who have sacrificed their time, their limbs, and sometimes their lives to protect and ensure our freedoms.</p>
<p>With the angel lifting the dog tags of the seven fallen heroes as she rises, the park will help to lift the spirits of the people who come to visit this place to pay homage to our many veterans.</p>
<p>Donations of cash, labor, materials, and other in-kind contributions have already amounted to about $650,000. People from this small town have done a lot to make it happen in Smithville. This is the final piece to completing the park. The angel needs your help.</p>
<p><strong>What you get</strong></p>
<p>With donations of any size, you get our heartfelt thanks and a tour of the park if you are able to visit Smithville (a great place to be!).</p>
<p>With any donation over $25, we will include the name of a service member on the memorial plaques posted in the park. </p>
<p>With donations over $100, in addition to the name on the plaques, a paver that can be dedicated to that service member will be placed in the park.</p>
<p>To claim these perks, you will need to provide Jill Strube with the name, rank, branch of service, and conflict or years of service of the veteran--click on Jill's icon at the top of this page to send her a message with the details.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Please help us make this go viral! Forward this to as many people as possible to help us reach our goal. ""Like"" us with the Facebook icon!</p>
<p>If you can’t contribute at this time but live in Bastrop County, we are currently seeking people who can help post the plaques on the wall as they come in, as well as for more help in researching the Bastrop County Veterans and developing the archive. </p>
<p>And if you are ever in Central Texas, come on out to visit us! We’d love to meet y’all and show you our beautiful park and the rest of this magical area!</p>

<h3>So Who Is This Girl? </h3>
<div>Despite being a writer, trying to decide what to say in the first few lines of something to “catch someone’s attention” is never easy for me--especially when those first few lines are supposed to be about myself. I suppose that’s something I need to work on, so if you are still reading I’ll simply start off this introduction the way I start off every introduction to anyone I’ve ever met--Hi, I’m Kimmee.<br class=""kix-line-break""/><br class=""kix-line-break""/> If you want to know about my story and why I’m here on Indiegogo asking you to help me go to my dream school I’m not sure how to concisely tell you that, so bear with me if you will. Ever since I was a little girl growing up in my little rural community in southern Michigan, I have been captivated by stories. I feel this sense of connection to the world around me that is hard to describe. When I look at a person I see more than just a face. I see this complicated, beautiful messof possibilities, possibilities to share and create together something incredibly powerful, a story.<br/><br/>I believe storytelling is one of the most powerful tools humanity has. It’s how we connect. It’s how we share. It’s how we understand the people and the world in which we live. This world is a complicated one; everything is always changing. Throughout all the changes in the centuries of this world, however, one thing has not changed. Everyone loves a good story.<br/><br/>The love of a story is something deep within us that connects us all. It’s in our blood. I know it’s in mine because I feel it pulsing through me every day. I live, breathe, and dream stories because I believe with everything in me everyone has a story to tell. True, all stories may not be life changing, Pulitzer Prize winning, stories that impact a whole country, but everyone does have a story to share. Even if that story may only affect a person or two isn’t it worth it to try to share it? That’s why I want to dedicate my life to being a documentary photographer/writer.<br/><br/>This summer, after I finished up my undergraduate studies at Spring Arbor University in Spring Arbor, Michigan I was accepted into my dream school, The Salt Institute for Documentary Studies in Portland, Maine to begin my graduate studies in documentary photography. I had everything fairly well figured out at the start of the summer when I was accepted. I was given a very generous scholarship from Salt, and I thought by working full time at my summer job and using my savings I would be able to take out a small loan and be okay. However, in the beginning of July, I injured my arm, and I’ve been unable to work since. I still thought I might be okay with the scholarship, using all my savings, and taking out a larger loan, but I’m short the money I need.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I am short around $2,000 to pay for the rest of my housing and tuition and to get the books and equipment I need not only for school this fall, but to set me up for what I need to further my studies and career when I’m done at Salt. Whatever funds I raise first will be going directly toward my housing and tuition, and then I’ll use the rest for books and equipment.<br/><br/>What I can offer as far as perks go are listed in the sidebar; I realize they are small, but hopefully there will be something there that sounds good to you if you’re able to help me.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Most writers want to create something that will have an impact, that will be remembered, but I suppose you could say I’m not looking for the “greatness.” If it happens to come my way, then that’s fine, but I’m not trying to seek it out. My goal in life has always aligned with a poem written by one of my favorite poets, Emily Dickenson, “If I can stop one heart from breaking/I shall not live in vain/If I can ease one life the aching, or cool one pain/Or help one fainting robin/Unto his nest again/I shall not live in vain.” The impact I hope to have with the knowledge and experience I’ll gain from Salt is simply to help the people I meet along the way. I’m hoping by getting to share their stories, no matter what they may be, I’ll be able to make even a small difference.</div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Colleen Hudson, and I am a teacher in the small rural town of Thorp, Washington.  We are so small that the whole school district sits in two buildings besides each other.  The high school and middle school boasts a grand total of fifty-four students.  Two years ago I started a History Club call P.A.S.T.-People Actively Seeking the future Through history.  I work with kids grades 6-12 in this club. </p>
<p>My goal is to teach the importance of the history of this small community and the impact it has had on our state, country, and the world.  One may say, how can such a small town have an affect on the world?  Actually Lt. Col. Claude Thorp originally led the guerilla movement in the Philippines during WWII before being captured and executed. We can also boast about having a four star general graduate from this small school.  You see, this little town has produced men and women that helped change history.</p>
<p><br/> Okay, I bet that you can tell that I live and breathe history.  My goal is to pass at least a bit of my enthusiasm on to the next generation.  This is why I would like to take my kids to Washington D.C. and Williamsburg, Virginia.  We will spend five days touring these two historic cities.  It will be such an exciting time and for most of these kids, this will be a trip of a lifetime.   You see, about 60% of my kids are at poverty level, and one student lost her home to the forest fires that swept through our state last summer.  With your support, these students will travel beyond this little valley and experience events that will remain with them their entire lifetime.  You will also help expose fifteen future voters to the civic duty represented in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>We are going through the Smithsonian’s Education First Student Travel tours.  Everything is included in the package, air flight, tours, meals, and lodging.  This program also offers kids the opportunity to earn one semester credit of history.  My students-especially the middle school kids-are excited to earn an extra credit for high school. The cost for this is 1,829.00 per student and at this time fifteen students want to go.</p>
<p>At the present time, the club has raised approximately $1,400.00 through bake sales.  These kids are amazing and willing to bake our way there.  That is why I've decided to use their skills as perks for your donations.  If you donate, we will bake goodies and send post cards to you from our trip.  We will even make sure that our club sends generous sponsors specially made t-shirt designed for the trip.  You will share the excitement and see the sights that we will see.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute, please help us find other ways in which we can work toward this trip or share our campaign with your friends.  We are grateful for your participation!</p>

<p><strong>The Sibanye Story</strong></p>
<p>Sibanye is the result of two people from South Africa dreaming together.  Randy could neither read nor write but dreamed of becoming a chef.  His friend Nathan had always wanted a place for people from the country’s divided communities to come together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-H3w_uYLXrUw/UAWGVbUMO0I/AAAAAAAAAPI/pa-eB-g0PCQ/s720/IMG_3814.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Rands and Me""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/> Together, in 2008, Randy (then 19) and Nathan (then 21) built Sibanye, which means “together we are one”.  From a humble base in a shack of corrugated iron and ceiling boards in a township near Cape Town a team was built to create and serve delicious traditional South African food. </p>

The Sibanye Story
Sibanye is the result of two people from South Africa dreaming together.  Randy could neither read nor write but dreamed of becoming a chef.  His friend Nathan had always wanted a place for people from the country’s divided communities to come together.
 

 
 Together, in 2008, Randy (then 19) and Nathan (then 21) built Sibanye, which means “together we are one”.  From a humble base in a shack of corrugated iron and ceiling boards in a township near Cape Town a team was built to create and serve delicious traditional South African food. 
 
 

 

 
Since its beginning Sibanye has served over 15,000 meals to local and international guests who come to visit this most unique restaurant: people who can’t afford it eat for free (subsidised instead by willing international guests). 

 

 
Tragically, at the age of 22, Randy passed away in June 2011, leaving an unfillable gap in the Sibanye Team. 
 

 
Faced with the decision of whether to stop or carry on Nathan, Terra and Nosamkelo decided they would relentlessly push on. Together the team wants to take Sibanye to a whole new level, making it a lasting and fitting legacy to Randy’s dream.
 

 
What difference will your help make to Sibanye? From the Sibanye Team: We need your help to establish Sibanye as a unifying force that will create the much needed change for this community.  Our expansion from a 25 seater restaurant to a 60 seater restaurant will provide employment to 3 additional community members.  The upgrade of our restaurant will coincide with the launch of Sibanye’s first trailer franchise in Cape Town:

We will invest in a mobile unit (a trailer) so that we can serve MORE MEALS to MORE PEOPLE
We will RE-FIT and UPGRADE the original restaurant
We will RE-VAMP our brand and our marketing
When we’re ready we will RE-LAUNCH our revitalised venture 
 What’s in it for you?  By investing in us you will be helping to keep our dream alive.  Most importantly you will be making a direct difference to the lives of people living in South Africa.  Also, look to the right to understand how the level of your contribution is incentivised!  Become a part of our Sibanye family – become an official Legend! The Impact You will be able to monitor the progress of the project as it unfolds through blog postings that you can follow via the Sibanye website and facebook page, to see the impact for yourself.

<h3>Who We Are </h3>
<p>         Hello! Our names are Daniel Warren Bartlett and Antonio Luke Thompson. We are from Santa Maria, California, where we are both actively involved in our church and our youth group. We are both college students who have a passion for people. We both love our Savior, Jesus Christ, and we both want to live our lives proclaiming the good news of Jesus to the world. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where We Are Going</h3>
<p>           We have been accepted to Joshua Wilderness Institute, a Christian mentorship program in the Sequoia National Forest at Hume Lake Christian Camps, for the 2012-2013 school year. Joshua is difficult to get into, and we feel very fortunate to have been selected. It is designed to help students grow and change. Every year, more than 250 young people apply from all over the world, and only 56 people are accepted each year; 28 guys and 28 girls. JWI's mission statement is: ""Transforming the life effectiveness of God's people,"" and we want this to be evident in our own lives. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why We Want To Go</h3>
<p>          We want to go to JWI because we know people who have gone through the program, and how their lives have been changed and the passion to serve God has been lit in their hearts. We want to go to Joshua because we know that the lessons we learn and the experiences we share will be life changing. We want to learn what it takes to be a modern-day disciple of Jesus Christ, and how we can live for Christ every day. We want to learn the path set out for us and to trust God to lead us there. We want to go to Joshua because we know that it will be something that we will never forget, and that we will learn lessons, have experiences, and make friends that we will never forget. We want to learn what it means to be a Christ-follower, and not just a Christian. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Will Do At Joshua</h3>
<p>          While at Joshua, we spend much time devouring and studying God's word. we have many different guest speakers form all over the country come and teach us. we have assignments due and work to be done. We take classes on Elements of Bible, the Pauline Epistles, Major Prophets, Christian Life and Ethics, and many more. We will be taking accredited classes through Moody Bible College, and the classes that we take are transferrable to Moody Bible and San Diego Christian.</p>
<p>          During the year, we will take a total of 6 mission trips; 3 domestic and 3 international. We travel to inner city LA to spread God's word and love to those who are less fortunate. We go to Heartland, a nearby camp, and help with whatever service projects they need which can range from cleaning toilets to raking pine needles, and we go twice in one year. Internationally, we go to Mexico, The Dominican Republic, and finally, Israel. In Mexico, we work at Rancho Sordo Mudo, which is a school for the deaf. We assist with work projects, and learn about the Mexican culture. In the Dominican Republic, we help to teach participants about how to understand God's will for their lives, and how they can pursue it. While there, we also do various work projects to help out the local people. Finally, at the end of the year, we travel to Israel, where we will learn to bring all of our Old Testament learning that we did throughout the year and relate it all. We spend 2 weeks hiking all over Israel, and experience the very rich religious history that the country has to offer. We walk where Jesus walked, and experience the place where our Savior lived and breathed.</p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>           While we are working our hardest and pinching every penny to save for tuition, we only so far have about $4,000 each. Antonio is working this summer at Hume Lake to help pay part of his tuition. Daniel has also worked to pay part of his tuition. We need to raise about  $13,000 more to be able to pay the whole tuition. Our desire to go is huge and our desire to learn is even larger. JWI is not cheap, but it is worth every penny spent. </p>

<p>All money raised will be applied towards tuition. Any surplus funds raised will go towards helping other students who cannot pay all their tuition.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Without your help, Peralta's art program will all but disappear this fall.</span>
<p>For many years, our two artists-in-residence, Ellen Oppenheimer and Trena Noval, have secured grants from a broad patchwork of public and private sources. Sadly, despite their hard work and the sweat equity of our parents and caregivers, many of Peralta's funding sources have dried up. Public arts funding—from the city, the county, and the state—has been cut way back, and many of our foundation grants have run dry as well.</p>
<p>Like every other California public school, we are also facing severe overall budget cuts, which means the loss of a classroom teacher and much larger class sizes. In this difficult environment, the arts are more critical than ever to keep students engaged in school.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$15,000 in online donations, plus an additional $30,000</span> from events and a large-donor gift campaign. This money will close our funding gap, allowing us to keep our two longstanding artists-in-residence and maintain the art programming that has influenced the lives of so many Oakland children. Recognizing that there are many schools in need, we also plan to donate $1,000 to another Oakland public school art program if we reach our goal.</p>
<p>Please join us in supporting arts education for Oakland kids, and helping others to see how art can be a powerful teaching and learning tool! All donations will be administered by the Peralta Parent Teacher Group, and are tax deductible (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">EIN # is 94-2831259</span>).</p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;"">When you make your donation, consider rounding it up by a few dollars to cover the processing fees for the online campaign</span> (click ""other amount,"" round $100 to $106; $50 to $53). You can also save us credit card processing fees if you have a PayPal account linked your bank account. Please make sure to include your name and address so we can thank you and send you your perk!</p>

We are a small, economically and racially diverse school that defies the the stereotypes of an urban public school. Peralta is a place where: 

Fourth-graders worked with a UC Berkeley mycologist to create a hand-drawn animated video that will teach Spanish-speaking communities how to use fungus to clean up oil spills.
Fifth-graders worked with students and teachers in Bangalore, India on a multifaceted exploration of the meaning of shelter, building a conceptual art installation that makes a statement about slums and the unequal distribution of wealth globally (visit website).
Second- and third-graders take regular walks to a community senior center to collaborate with elders on art projects.

 

 

First-graders told the cultural history of their neighborhood, the Temescal, through a cut-paper stop-motion animated video (watch it).
Every child makes regular visits San Francisco's de Young museum, and begins to think of it as their museum. 
Student films recently won recognition from Disney Planet Challenge, Stopwaste.org, and prominent directors who judged the Albany Film Festival.
Every student works on Peralta's famous quilts, which have been shown internationally, including at the embassy in Moscow.
Murals created with artist Jamie Morgan cover every surface of our buildings, organic gardens fill every corner of our cramped schoolyard, and student self-portraits beautify busy Telegraph Avenue.

We have also been honored as a California Distinguished School and a Title I Achievement School, which recognizes the success of our students from all socioeconomic backgrounds.
""These projects have spurred some of the deepest thinking that takes place in my classroom,"" says 1st-grade teacher Pam Lucker.
 

The Impact


Without your help, Peralta's art program will all but disappear this fall.
For many years, our two artists-in-residence, Ellen Oppenheimer and Trena Noval, have secured grants from a broad patchwork of public and private sources. Sadly, despite their hard work and the sweat equity of our parents and caregivers, many of Peralta's funding sources have dried up. Public arts funding—from the city, the county, and the state—has been cut way back, and many of our foundation grants have run dry as well.
Like every other California public school, we are also facing severe overall budget cuts, which means the loss of a classroom teacher and much larger class sizes. In this difficult environment, the arts are more critical than ever to keep students engaged in school.
 

 


What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $15,000 in online donations, plus an additional $30,000 from events and a large-donor gift campaign. This money will close our funding gap, allowing us to keep our two longstanding artists-in-residence and maintain the art programming that has influenced the lives of so many Oakland children. Recognizing that there are many schools in need, we also plan to donate $1,000 to another Oakland public school art program if we reach our goal.
Please join us in supporting arts education for Oakland kids, and helping others to see how art can be a powerful teaching and learning tool! All donations will be administered by the Peralta Parent Teacher Group, and are tax deductible (EIN # is 94-2831259).
When you make your donation, consider rounding it up by a few dollars to cover the processing fees for the online campaign (click ""other amount,"" round $100 to $106; $50 to $53). You can also save us credit card processing fees if you have a PayPal account linked your bank account. Please make sure to include your name and address so we can thank you and send you your perk!
Also take a moment to share a story about Peralta's arts program, or about why art education is important to you.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Project Icarus is an International Interstellar Spacecraft Design Team. Our project started in September 2009, as a volunteer project conceived as the successor to British Interplanetary Society's influential 1978 Project Daedalus. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As such, Project Icarus - Son of Daedalus is a modern engineering design challenge for a fusion propelled based robotic spacecraft capable of exploring a solar system within 15 light-years from Earth.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You can donate and read more about us at <a href=""http://www.icarusinterstellar.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">http://www.icarusinterstellar.org</a>.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What started as a scientific question has now become an engineering challenge for Project Icarus. Project Daedalus proved that Interstellar Flight was FEASIBLE. Project Icarus is now focused on proving Interstellar travel is REALIZABLE within our lifetimes. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have set strict limitations for our design. The Icarus spacecraft would need to reach a its target star within 100 years - ideally much less. For example, we would need to achieve speeds of approximately 10% of the speed of light to decelerate at Alpha Centauri within 75 years. Contrast with the Voyager-1 spacecraft will approach another star in 24,000 years.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have 35 researchers - all dedicating thousands of hours of their time to understand the scientific constraints and spread the world to people like you - ""The technology is within our grasp. All we need is focus and a good plan!"" </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Project Icarus has an active Student Designer program - the only interstellar spacecraft design program in the world! We intend on training current and future generations in interstellar spacecraft design. By doing so, we believe we can also drive current solar system and planetary space exploration. A starship capable of going to Alpha Centauri in 50 years can make it to Mars in 3 weeks!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Project Icarus has now founded ""Icarus Interstellar"" - a non-profit research organization with aim to foster research into those necessary technologies which can make interstellar research a reality: </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>- Fusion, </p>
<p>- Advanced Ultra-light, ultra-strong materials, </p>
<p>- Nanotechnology</p>
<p>- Advanced power sources</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Project Icarus is an International Interstellar Spacecraft Design Team. Our project started in September 2009, as a volunteer project conceived as the successor to British Interplanetary Society's influential 1978 Project Daedalus. 

As such, Project Icarus - Son of Daedalus is a modern engineering design challenge for a fusion propelled based robotic spacecraft capable of exploring a solar system within 15 light-years from Earth.

You can donate and read more about us at http://www.icarusinterstellar.org.

The Impact
What started as a scientific question has now become an engineering challenge for Project Icarus. Project Daedalus proved that Interstellar Flight was FEASIBLE. Project Icarus is now focused on proving Interstellar travel is REALIZABLE within our lifetimes. 

We have set strict limitations for our design. The Icarus spacecraft would need to reach a its target star within 100 years - ideally much less. For example, we would need to achieve speeds of approximately 10% of the speed of light to decelerate at Alpha Centauri within 75 years. Contrast with the Voyager-1 spacecraft will approach another star in 24,000 years.

We have 35 researchers - all dedicating thousands of hours of their time to understand the scientific constraints and spread the world to people like you - ""The technology is within our grasp. All we need is focus and a good plan!"" 

Project Icarus has an active Student Designer program - the only interstellar spacecraft design program in the world! We intend on training current and future generations in interstellar spacecraft design. By doing so, we believe we can also drive current solar system and planetary space exploration. A starship capable of going to Alpha Centauri in 50 years can make it to Mars in 3 weeks!

Project Icarus has now founded ""Icarus Interstellar"" - a non-profit research organization with aim to foster research into those necessary technologies which can make interstellar research a reality: 

- Fusion, 
- Advanced Ultra-light, ultra-strong materials, 
- Nanotechnology
- Advanced power sources
- Artificial or Machine Intelligence for space exploration
- ... and many more

A complete breakdown of our (20) research modules can be found at http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/currentresearch.php


What We Need
Project Icarus is made up of volunteers around the world. We work remotely and only a small fraction of us have ever been in the same room together. Our main purpose for this fund-raising effort is to allow out students and researchers present the DARPA / NASA 100 Year Starship Symposium (http://www.100yss.org).

Many of our designers are highly motivated students without the financial capability to travel across the world to present at this conference. 

** The funds raised here will be used exclusively for travel and board to the 100 Year Starship Symposium (100YSS).**

Priority will be given to our student designers * we believe in investing in the future!

<h2><strong>There's only one place to find 600 Mr. Miyagis in the United States</strong></h2>
<p>And that's at the Higher Educational Web Professionals Conference. This year, that conference will be in Milwaukee, October 10-12.</p>
<p>It's like the Tri-Valley tournament of higher ed web conferences. Experts in content strategy, programming, social media, information architecture, marketing, brand development, and audience engagement come together for three days of learning, sharing, collaborating, and bonding.</p>
<p>But there's no leg-sweeping going on here. This is the greatest group of professionals you can join. The relationships you make here will be invaluable - a resource to turn to for advice, tips, instruction, collaboration, and just plain old shoulder-to-cry on support when all else fails.</p>
<h3><strong>We're looking for Daniel Carusos to bring to the Tournament</strong></h3>
<p>As great as this group is, it hasn't reached everyone. And that's where you come in.</p>
<p>We're looking to fund the registration fees for three attendees to come to the conference. Up and coming underdogs who've got the chops and the know-how, but just don't have the resources to come.<span><br/><br/></span>Here's the deal. Donate what you can to help us meet our goal. Along the way, we've got some excellent corporate sponsors willing to chip and do their part as a way to show their appreciation to the community. In return, they've provided us with a few perks which you can see listed.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>We're looking for $1854 from individuals and corporate sponsors to fund three registrations</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain how much funding you need and where it’s going. Be transparent and specific—people need to trust you to want to fund you.</li>
<li>Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!</li>
<li>Describe where the funds go if you don’t reach your entire goal.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Where does the money go?</strong></h3>
<p>If we reach our funding goal of $1800, the money will go directly to three chosen winners from our applicant pool to purchase conference passes. We'll coordinate those funds going on to heweb. The remaining $54.00 will go towards the processing fee for the fundraiser to Indiegogo.</p>
<p>If the funding amount is not reached, we will still retain the funds that have been collected, minus a 9% fee for indiegogo. The amount will be used to purchase conference passes from our winners, up to the number we can.  Any remaining balance will be donated to that winner to cover the costs of airfare or for hotel.</p>
<h2><strong>Hey, Daniel-Sans!</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Want to come to heweb?</strong></h3>
<p>Here are the ground rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must never have attended an HighEdWeb national conference before</li>
<li>You must <a href=""http://uniondesignphoto.com/hewebway/submit-an-application/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fill out this essay</a> on why you want to attend</li>
<li>You must agree to write a blog post on your greatest takeaways from the conference (publication site to be determined)</li>
<li>You must wax all the cars and paint all our fences, after doing 3,000 push ups over lit candles (just kidding)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can only guarantee that your scholarship will cover the costs of your ticket to heweb (unless we don't reach our goal - see above). It won't cover getting here or staying in a hotel so take note! (the hotel runs about $149 a night).</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.</li>
<li>Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).</li>
<li>Make it real for people and build trust.</li>

<p>My name is Dan Oh and when I’m not working as a copywriter in NYC, I am involved in the annual IYF World Camp.</p>
<p>IYF World Camp provides quality development programs that teach and inspire young people to become agents of change throughout the world. During its infancy in 1995, IYF World Camp first inspired me to serve others and sacrifice myself for the greater good. I have been giving back to it ever since.</p>
<p>Your generous contributions will help offset the costs of executing our array of programming throughout a typical World Camp day. The better quality the programs, the greater chance our attendees emerge having gained the motivation to change themselves and the lives of others.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Look to your right and you'll see what you get at different levels of donation amounts.</p>
<p>We’ll also draw names out of a hat every 2 or 3 days and feature that person on our website leading up to the start of the IYF World Camp. We’ll notify you once your name, picture, and contribution amount go live on our website. What you will definitely get is a Thank-You letter you can use for tax purposes and a post-Camp report about what we did and how we used your contributions.</p>

</ul><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>IYF World Camp currently serves over 35 countries in 41 separate camps per year. Almost 1 million people have already attended World Camps. Through it, we've sent over 5000 volunteers to foreign countries, 560 medical volunteers who have treated a total of 60,000 patients in developing countries, and 1000 volunteer ESL instructors having taught English in places like Russia, Mexico, and Haiti.</p>

While it is delicate to enter into a rural community, we have had good reception by having a strong philosophy of humility and respect. We meet parents, many times at their home, to discuss our program, their expectations, safety and our collective goals. Likewise, we integrate respectfully with teachers and schools. </p>
<p>ConCiencia Summer Nature Camp is a travelling program, working for two years in each location. Permanent change is important to us.

Do we make a difference? -In 2013, we discovered our 90% of 2nd year students increased understanding of almost 75% of the ecological concepts we explored. -1 in 2 students increased the amount of time they spent in Nature. -1 in 3 families incorporated nature in the leisure time-1 in 5 children picked up trash on family outings to the beach
-80% of parents observed a positive change in their child's attitude towards the environment.   Risks & Challenges ConCiencia has a proven track record working with underserved coastal communities. While it is delicate to enter into a rural community, we have had good reception by having a strong philosophy of humility and respect. We meet parents, many times at their home, to discuss our program, their expectations, safety and our collective goals. Likewise, we integrate respectfully with teachers and schools. 
ConCiencia Summer Nature Camp is a travelling program, working for two years in each location. Permanent change is important to us. During the second year we invite outstanding students from the 1st year to be team leaders. Our goal is to empower them to form nature clubs the following year through a small grant program.
