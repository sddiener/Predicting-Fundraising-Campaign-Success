<p>This went on for weeks. Then we moved in.</p>
<p>And my wife, who had made so much fun of me…this big fat man
being scared of a little house, came to me and said “man this house is creepy.

I put it out there on the web.  First
through a message board with the remnants of Movie Poet: “hey, I have this idea
about a dude that opens a hide-a-key thingy and instead of a key finds a memory
stick with a bunch of videos on it that show an unknown intruder seriously

<br/><p><i>Here's what the movie's about:</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>A dude comes home from work. It’s late…raining. He’s in a
terrible mood.  He rushes to get the
groceries out and locks his keys in the car. He’s f***ed. His wife and the kids
are at her parents’.  What to do? What to
do?  SALVATION…he remembers that he’d
bought one of those little hide-a-key thingy that looks like a rock and you
stick your key in it and put it in the garden or something for just such an
emergency.  So he looks for the faux
rock—not an easy thing to do in the middle of the night with no flashlight. He
finds it. Sighs of relief.  He opens the
rock to find…</i></p>
<p><i>No key.</i></p>
<p><i>In its place, a small flash drive.</i></p>
<p><i>He breaks a window. Gets in his house. Fires up the computer
and inserts the drive.</i></p>
<p><i>There are a series of media files. As he plays each one, to
his horror, he realizes that they are of him and his family, and they are shot
inside his house (using the hide-a-key for access one would presume) by an
unknown intruder.  Some are during the
day, some are at night, some while they are sleeping. As the video clips
progress, he realizes that the intruder has begun to ACTIVELY participate in
his life.</i></p>So these scripts...and I am a horror FAN. I grew up...let me tell you...my MOTHER took me to see Friday the 13th Part 3 while we were on vacation at a place called Crystal Lake (this is 100% true...as much as anything in a 10 year old's memory can be)...I saw TX Chainsaw at a Drive-In that same summer.  I grew up in the age of the VHS...and pre-Blockbuster Video and every weekend my allowance was spent on renting horror movies.  Pieces, The Dorm that Dripped Blood, Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, et al.... I tell you that to make you understand that I am not a newbie and/or easily shocked.  I saw Halloween before I saw The Apple Dumpling Gang.  I know  horror.<div>
<br/><p>The scripts. They started coming in.  And I started reading and quickly realized that I may have gotten myself into something that I can't get out of. Because these scripts are the most f***ed up things I've ever read (pardon my francais).  And now I have to make them.  I have to cast people and do the things to them that are in these scripts.</p>
<p>I have to figure out ways to do the things to these poor people that these sickos want me to do...</p>
<p>and that costs money.  The amount is negotiable but I always felt that Bowfinger was onto something when he said that all movies, cash in, cost $2,184.  So that's what I'm asking for...if it's good enough for Chubby Rain, it's good enough for Hide-A-Key.</p>

<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>Four ex couples. One goal. To find <i>The Value of Ex</i>. What happens when a relationship ends, but your heart refuses to let go?<i> The Value of Ex</i> is a romantic comedy series following the misadventures of a
group of college friends as they struggle to navigate the murky waters between breaking
up and moving on. When the curve balls of life cause them to cross paths with men from their past, they must determine whether to give love a second chance or close the door forever.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At its core, <i>The Value of Ex</i> is about determining  who to add, who to keep, and who to subtract from the equation of your life.  In season 2, the ladies must come to terms with the past and decide if these men can add any value to their future. Through their sisterhood, laughter, and Angela’s unique brand of therapy, the ladies discover that <i>The Value of Ex</i> is not only about determining the value of past love, but ultimately about the value of the love they have for each other and themselves. </p>

My name is Bridgett Michele Lawrence and I'm an aspiring television writer who is working hard to turn my Hollywood dreams into a reality.  I am originally from New York, where I earned my Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Film &TV Production and Dramatic Writing at New York University's prestigious Tisch School of the Arts.  My original pilot, The Value of Ex, won first place in the Organization of Black Screenwriters’ Original Script Competition and garnered the attention of executives at the CW as well as Overbrook Entertainment.  In 2012, rather than waiting for Hollywood to greenlight my project, I decided to greenlight myself and produce the show on my own as a web series.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Konyak is one of the 16 major tribes living in Nagaland,
Northeast India. But the people there don't look like Indians, they are golden
skinned with more Asiatic eye features. 
These tribes probably came from China and
Mongolia long ago. The Konyak
land is situated in the northeastern part of Nagaland. Their land is a
mountainous region with rich products of natural forest. Most of the Konyak villages are
situated on hilltops.</span><br/></p>
<div>
<p>The Konyaks were animists, worshipping elements of nature,
until Christian missionaries arrived in the late 19th century. By the late 20th
Century, more than 90% of the population of the state had accepted Christianity
as their religion. Today, in every village of Nagaland there is a Christian
church. The common and most used language in Nagaland is Nagamese. The present
generation, however, has an inclination towards English, which is the medium of
instruction in school and college.</p>
<p>Konyak tribe is known as the last headhunters and it is famous
for the facial tattoos of its warriors. The custom of killing
an enemy and bringing the head was indicative of courage and pride in the past.
The belief among Konyak forefathers was that there is a magical power in the
human skull. A heroic reception was accorded to a warrior who entered the
village with a captured head of an enemy. The village folk, men and women used
to offer ceremonial reception to the hero. Killing an enemy and severing his
head was considered a rite of passage for young boys, and success was rewarded
with a facial tattoo. This practice was banned in the 1940s, but since the last
headhunting case in Nagaland was reported in 1969, older tribesmen belong to
the last generation with facial tattoos.</p>
<p>The skin of the body was perforated and different designs were
drawn on different parts of the body such as face, chin, bosom and knees. The
tattooing was painful but the men and women in the past accepted it as a status
symbol. Men got their tattoos when someone of their age group had brought an
enemy’s head. But nowadays such practice is no longer observed.</p>
<p>Today only the old people of Nagaland preserve their genuine
habits, old stories and pass on the ancient marks of the tribal times. Youth
lives somewhere in-between the new world they believe in and the roots they
belong to. Everywhere you can see tall transmitter masts, because today nearly
every middle-aged and young Naga possess a mobile phone that they extensively use.
Globalization has reached at least the young Naga.</p>
<p>Modernization and globalization cause a cultural gap between
generations. This happens mostly to people who live in remote and isolated areas and our project is inspired by this
phenomenon and its subject are the Konyak people. We have divided it in two parts
and the first one, that you see here describes the elders of Konyak. With the passing of the
old generation any trace of their ancient tribal practices such as tattooing, body
piercing and collecting war trophies are bound to disappear. This first part puts
focus on all these tribal signs painted on their bodies and documenting their
tribal identity. In the second part we want to present the young members of the tribe. They wear
trendy clothes and even girls wear high heels on rough roads. Many of them have
moved in towns to work and only go to their home villages for festivals. Living
a modern life, influenced by Western culture or modern Asian lifestyle is now
what they do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately financial circumstances forced us to significantly
reduce our stay in Nagaland. We have only finished the first part. Now we are
eager to continue working on the theme and complete the second part of the
project. The portraits of the young generation of the tribe will be presented in
a modern, fashionable and cinematic style expressing their own desirable way of
living. Both parts together are a visual reflection of this cultural gap. We
believe by raising awareness with this project we will help to improve tourism
in Nagaland and make it more sustainable as well as people’s national identity.
Doing this project we can not only bring their unique culture onto the world
stage but we can help to understand better people living in remote and isolated
areas, who are recently exposed to the modern world. </p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Nagaland is known as the state with the worst road infrastructure in the world. Transportation there is difficult. A 50 km trip could take up to 3 hours. Local transport is very limited and only between major villages and towns. We will need to hire a private SUV and a driver. It is also essential to hire a guide because of the language barrier. We will be responsible for the accommodation and food expenses of our driver and guide. In some villages people speak their own dialect, so in this case we will need to hire a local person to help us communicate. To fulfil our goals and complete the second of the project we've estimated that we need to stay and work in Nagaland for 2 months. The campaign is calculated for this period of time.</span></p>

</div></div>","Konyak is one of the 16 major tribes living in Nagaland,
Northeast India. But the people there don't look like Indians, they are golden
skinned with more Asiatic eye features. 
These tribes probably came from China and
Mongolia long ago. The Konyak
land is situated in the northeastern part of Nagaland. Their land is a
mountainous region with rich products of natural forest. Most of the Konyak villages are
situated on hilltops.

The Konyaks were animists, worshipping elements of nature,
until Christian missionaries arrived in the late 19th century. By the late 20th
Century, more than 90% of the population of the state had accepted Christianity
as their religion. Today, in every village of Nagaland there is a Christian
church. The common and most used language in Nagaland is Nagamese. The present
generation, however, has an inclination towards English, which is the medium of
instruction in school and college.
Konyak tribe is known as the last headhunters and it is famous
for the facial tattoos of its warriors. The custom of killing
an enemy and bringing the head was indicative of courage and pride in the past.
The belief among Konyak forefathers was that there is a magical power in the
human skull. A heroic reception was accorded to a warrior who entered the
village with a captured head of an enemy. The village folk, men and women used
to offer ceremonial reception to the hero. Killing an enemy and severing his
head was considered a rite of passage for young boys, and success was rewarded
with a facial tattoo. This practice was banned in the 1940s, but since the last
headhunting case in Nagaland was reported in 1969, older tribesmen belong to
the last generation with facial tattoos.
The skin of the body was perforated and different designs were
drawn on different parts of the body such as face, chin, bosom and knees. The
tattooing was painful but the men and women in the past accepted it as a status
symbol. Men got their tattoos when someone of their age group had brought an
enemy’s head. But nowadays such practice is no longer observed.
Today only the old people of Nagaland preserve their genuine
habits, old stories and pass on the ancient marks of the tribal times. Youth
lives somewhere in-between the new world they believe in and the roots they
belong to. Everywhere you can see tall transmitter masts, because today nearly
every middle-aged and young Naga possess a mobile phone that they extensively use.
Globalization has reached at least the young Naga.
Modernization and globalization cause a cultural gap between
generations. This happens mostly to people who live in remote and isolated areas and our project is inspired by this
phenomenon and its subject are the Konyak people. We have divided it in two parts
and the first one, that you see here describes the elders of Konyak. With the passing of the
old generation any trace of their ancient tribal practices such as tattooing, body
piercing and collecting war trophies are bound to disappear. This first part puts
focus on all these tribal signs painted on their bodies and documenting their
tribal identity. In the second part we want to present the young members of the tribe. They wear
trendy clothes and even girls wear high heels on rough roads. Many of them have
moved in towns to work and only go to their home villages for festivals. Living
a modern life, influenced by Western culture or modern Asian lifestyle is now
what they do.
Unfortunately financial circumstances forced us to significantly
reduce our stay in Nagaland. We have only finished the first part. Now we are
eager to continue working on the theme and complete the second part of the
project. The portraits of the young generation of the tribe will be presented in
a modern, fashionable and cinematic style expressing their own desirable way of
living. Both parts together are a visual reflection of this cultural gap. We
believe by raising awareness with this project we will help to improve tourism
in Nagaland and make it more sustainable as well as people’s national identity.
Doing this project we can not only bring their unique culture onto the world
stage but we can help to understand better people living in remote and isolated
areas, who are recently exposed to the modern world. 



Stretch Goals




Photographing    -    Making a Book    -    Exhibition






What We Need & What You Get

Nagaland is known as the state with the worst road infrastructure in the world. Transportation there is difficult. A 50 km trip could take up to 3 hours. Local transport is very limited and only between major villages and towns. We will need to hire a private SUV and a driver. It is also essential to hire a guide because of the language barrier. We will be responsible for the accommodation and food expenses of our driver and guide. In some villages people speak their own dialect, so in this case we will need to hire a local person to help us communicate. To fulfil our goals and complete the second of the project we've estimated that we need to stay and work in Nagaland for 2 months. The campaign is calculated for this period of time.

<p>The story
enfolds on the banks of an imaginary river on a full moon night, when
Siddhartha crosses the river in a boat, leaving Yasodhara alone on the banks.
Yasodhara unable to find her beloved, Siddhartha, confronts deep pangs of separation.
Her suffering makes her vulnerable to life's many moods and thus she embarks on
a journey of contemplation on the various shades of life.</p><p></p><p>  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439012413/ghgzp9amv4rqf4nlq4zm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                      <p> <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Her quest for
truth takes her away from the river, to return back to the same river, each
time wearing a new skin. In every journey away from the river she sheds her old
skin to put on a new garb different from her last- A sad, scared
Yasodhara transforming into a seeker of truth, the seeker of truth returning as
a murderer, the murderer transforming into an enlightened being – all these
latent personalities of Yasodhara unfold around the river. Her journey to
understand the cause of her suffering and her eventual enlightenment is what
the film 'YASODHARASUTRA' is all about.</span></p><div>
<p>The film is the
director's personal exploration of the character Yasodhara, Gautam Buddha's wife and her possible
journey in understanding life. The film projects Yasodhara as a woman who lives
a passionate and dangerous life after being abandoned by Siddhartha.  She
questions and probes the contradictions of life and in the process becomes free
of all entanglements and fears born out of years of conditioning. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<br/>
<p>Yasodhara in the
film is a rebel whose inquisitive mind refuses to accept life as it comes.
Drawing from the life of Yasodhara, the film tries to understand the cycle of
joy and pain, union and separation, death and birth, suffering and redemption
that a human being is subjected to. </p>
<p>Around the river
lives an old lady who weaves a quilt of memories. Unaware of the present, her
world is stitched with the memories of the past. </p>
<p>A fool, who is
visible only to Yasodhara and the old lady, is a being from the other world. He
has been banished from his world of moments, because he committed the blasphemy
of holding on to one moment. He is sent to the world of memories, to understand
the beauty of each moment and yet not hold any. While the old lady lives in the
world of memories, the fool's world is made of the present moment. He has no
memories and enjoys moment like a Haiku.</p>
<p>One by one all
die. The fool becomes
invisible to Yasodhara who has now been corrupted by the ways of the world. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>She finally
returns to the river, with the understanding that all the human suffering is a
result of societal conditioning. It's the ideas of right and wrong, moral and
immoral, love and romance, ownership and possession which create an illusion of
pain. Seeing reality devoid of these veils of conventions makes one free. She
leads a life of meditation around the river, befriending an old ferryman, who
teaches her the art of rowing the boat and awakens her to the many moods of the
river, symbolic of life.</p>
<p>It's at this
moment that she meets Siddhartha, who has now become enlightened. In the span
that Siddhartha attains enlightenment Yasodhara too has become enlightened.
Both meet at the river, where Yasodhara now rows a boat ferrying people across
the river. Siddhartha bows to the Buddha that had awakened in Yasodhara as
Yasodhara acknowledges the Buddha that had awakened within Siddhartha. </p>

<h4>THE KEY VALUE PROPOSITION</h4>
<p>The film reinterprets the life of Yasodhara, Gautam Buddha's wife, projecting her as a woman as enlightened as Gautam Buddha himself. The film proposes that Yasodhara in the span of six years, during which Siddhartha attained enlightenment, also went through a deep  intellectual churning, quite different from that of Siddhartha, attaining  enlightenment in the same span, pitching both Siddhartha and Yasodhara as equals.</p>
<p> It's not a period film.  It is a story which tries to break all perceptions of time and space, making it a lyrical and  magical rendition of life in its most poetic form. The  subtle humor created through interactions between characters, with deep philosophical meaning, makes it an enthralling piece of work. The element of celebration, of both - life and death, memories and moments, passion and meditation makes the story a compelling  and enriching piece of art.</p>

 It never was ours and it never will be ours. It belongs to all and all own it. 
WRITER'S NOTE 


""Yasodhara is my personal exploration into the realm of memories. It is my personal confrontations with life which finds space in this story, emphasizing the 'return'. 



Unable to understand the origins of sorrow, which had suddenly creeped into my life,I struggled to overcome the pain.  For eight long years I suffered chronic depression.
My research on Tibetan refugees took me to remote parts of Ladakh where I lived with the Tibetan shepherds for months, leading a nomadic life. I traveled with them as they moved from one place to another in search of greener pastures. They carried what they needed, accumulating nothing. Traveling with them I felt the weight of my own memories cluttered inside my mind. These memories created feelings of hate and love. I wanted to get rid of them but at the same time could not imagine my existence devoid of the same. After all, it was the memories which linked my past with the present creating the sense of who I was. 
I was confused, disturbed and angry about my state of being. Death seemed the only way to end the suffering. It was while suffering with  high fever when this story and all it's characters magically reveled themselves to me. I wrote the first draft of the script  in the state of absolute infirmity...and as I wrote, I discovered yet another way of dying - moving from moment to moment; leaving the known and embracing the unknown, is what I realized dying was all all about. 
As I wrote 'YASODHARASUTRA' my own mind found answers to many of my own questions. This story is a lotus which bloomed after years of deep sorrow within me and it is this lotus which I wish to offer the world, in absolute gratitude"".                                                                                                            Jyoti Patil 

   
ABOUT THE DIRECTOR 
Jyoti Patil is a passionate story teller. Life for her is a way of gathering stories. A filmmaker by profession she has numerous documentaries and short films to her credit. Survival strategies adopted by communities in extreme circumstances and situations is what fascinates her. It’s the spirit of survival which she has tried to capture through her very humble film projects. 

After completing a master’s
programme in mass communications, in the year 2000, Jyoti has been directing
documentary and short films on various social and environmental issues. From
her experience as a national reporter with a national news channel she soon realized
that the main stream media had little space for issues of the marginalized.
Having quit her job as a reporter she began working with NGOs in the rural
Maharashtra getting a grip of issues confronting rural areas. With this
exhaustive field experience she went ahead to develop communication strategies for
grassroots NGOs, such that it becomes an effective intervention for change.
Without fussing about high end
communication tools she worked along with the community to form their own tools
of communications. This involved making small films, audio magazines, posters
and performing street theatre. She initiated rural film clubs showcasing best
of cinema to the rural audience especially to the youth, as an initiative of
NGOs she worked with. These film clubs run weekly with at least 15 to 20
community members watching films on various issues followed by discussions. 
She has directed and produced
documentaries on livelihood issues of bootleggers, environmental movements in rural
Maharashtra, changing agricultural practices in the region of Ladakh, metal
crafts of Uttar Pradesh. Her films have been screened at various national and
international film festivals. Subjects of her films have ranged from criminal
and denotified tribes to women’s empowerment, local self governance,
environment and ecology. She has also directed promotional films for NGOs
working in the social sector. 

She is currently based in a small village, Satola, in the central Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India, from where she pursues her passion for writing, film making and photography.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We have come out of our pockets for the travel and pre-production of this film. International licensing, lodging, travel, security, location scouting, equipment rentals. Although we have lots of equipment already, but some items are vital for shots and could not be imported such as cranes, generators, safety equipment and harnesses, weather proofing from crazy monsoon rains. </p>
<p>It was expensive getting out here, but it has been well worth the journey. We are approximately 75% through the film portion of this project. In order to stay at a steady pace and finish this aspect of the film, we have to keep the crew happy and fed. Cameramen, security, stuntmen, choreographers, martial artists, actors, lighting crew, set dressers and make-up artists.</p>

""Everyday is one step closer to the future. Enjoy the ride… its going to be an exciting and crazy one."" - IQ (Lead scientist: iRUKANDJi Faction)

We have come out of our pockets for the travel and pre-production of this film. International licensing, lodging, travel, security, location scouting, equipment rentals. Although we have lots of equipment already, but some items are vital for shots and could not be imported such as cranes, generators, safety equipment and harnesses, weather proofing from crazy monsoon rains. 
It was expensive getting out here, but it has been well worth the journey. We are approximately 75% through the film portion of this project. In order to stay at a steady pace and finish this aspect of the film, we have to keep the crew happy and fed. Cameramen, security, stuntmen, choreographers, martial artists, actors, lighting crew, set dressers and make-up artists.
ENFORCER - Genetically enhanced strong-arm for the Shadow Clans.KENJIRO - Genetically enhanced Enforcer of the iRUKANDJi Faction

The modern myths of our time. </p><p>Since kids, we've been fascinated by their flashy costumes, powers, but most all the human element. <i>What do they tell us about ourselves?  </i>Why the superhero genre continues to appeal and fascinate the public is because it not only shows us what we are capable of; willing to do the impossible for our friends, family or complete strangers, but also it makes us look at our world and society in a different light and provokes us to ask the question, ""How can I make it a better place?""</p><p>Power, of any kind, can be used for good or evil depending on the person and situation. In <i>Legendary</i>, we explore that to the fullest with our main protagonist (Zane Bolton/Legendary) and antagonist (Arnold Trust, CEO of Trust Global). What are the great lengths we are willing to go to keep that power or take it away? If given such miraculous gifts would we, as individuals, use them for justice and the betterment of mankind or would we use them for destructive purposes? The choices that we make in but also the characters in our series have infinite effects and possibilities. </p><p>What the director, producers, writer, cast and crew hope to achieve with the audience is first to entertain you but most of all we want you to look at these characters and their decisions closely. </p><p><i>Is Arnold Trust really a bad man or is he doing bad things because of the grave situation he is in?</i><span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/></span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/></span><i>Could Zane have done more to prevent his father's death?</i><span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/></span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/></span><i>What is it that makes a hero? Are people born with heroic traits, are they given to them by accident or chance, or do they develop these on their own free will? </i><br/></p><p>It's these questions that we want to arouse within our audience. </p> <p></p><h3>Crew:</h3><p>Justin Berrisford: Director </p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668601/files/20140623063501-10314503_10202109110030804_5572038347364796074_n.jpg?1403530501"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p><span><span>Born and raised in White Bear Lake, Justin has always aspired to be a part of something.

</h3></span></h3> <p>If you're a fan of the Marvel and D.C. cinematic universes, <i>Heroes </i>or comics in general, we feel this web series will be for you. It's got action, comedy, romance but also most of all we wanted to tell character-driven stories. While, yes, Pierce can fly like Superman, Zane can heal himself like Wolverine and both have the power of super-strength, our main objective when creating this was not only put our spin on the superhero genre and give people a reason to come back each week and watch the next episode, but to present a show to the public, that in itself, feels like it exists within our own world. <span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>Zane, as stated above, starts out as the quarterback of the his football team. He's got a great girl, life couldn't be better, but then that all changes in an instant. Everything ordinary must be put aside and he must embrace the extraordinary in himself. Like all great heroes, he must answer the call, protect the ones he loves, fight evil wherever it lurks and be the stuff legends are made of. <span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>Our goal is to finish the first season with a new season and episodes to follow. Episodes will run a length of 15-20 minutes. Six episodes total for each season. When all episodes are complete and transferred to DVD, viewers will have a chance to decide whether or not they want to watch the episodes separately or altogether as one complete 2-hour movie. We plan to finish all the episodes before October and have the finished product ready to view by or about January 2015. <span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></span></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>With your help and support, your donations will be used to pay our talented cast and crew, location fees, costumes, makeup, props, craft services and transportation fees. Your generous donations will also go towards post-production. This ranges from mixing sound, doing ADR if needed, adding visual effects and editing the episodes. <span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>We are looking to raise an estimated $5, 000 for this project. With all we have planned and to meet the wages and costs, we will need every dollar to do so.  We are creating an original universe that can next to Marvel's, D.C.'s or other comic brand names' universes.

<p></p></div>","Summary:Superheroes. The modern myths of our time. Since kids, we've been fascinated by their flashy costumes, powers, but most all the human element. What do they tell us about ourselves?  Why the superhero genre continues to appeal and fascinate the public is because it not only shows us what we are capable of; willing to do the impossible for our friends, family or complete strangers, but also it makes us look at our world and society in a different light and provokes us to ask the question, ""How can I make it a better place?""Power, of any kind, can be used for good or evil depending on the person and situation. In Legendary, we explore that to the fullest with our main protagonist (Zane Bolton/Legendary) and antagonist (Arnold Trust, CEO of Trust Global). What are the great lengths we are willing to go to keep that power or take it away? If given such miraculous gifts would we, as individuals, use them for justice and the betterment of mankind or would we use them for destructive purposes? The choices that we make in but also the characters in our series have infinite effects and possibilities. What the director, producers, writer, cast and crew hope to achieve with the audience is first to entertain you but most of all we want you to look at these characters and their decisions closely. Is Arnold Trust really a bad man or is he doing bad things because of the grave situation he is in?Could Zane have done more to prevent his father's death?What is it that makes a hero? Are people born with heroic traits, are they given to them by accident or chance, or do they develop these on their own free will? It's these questions that we want to arouse within our audience.  Crew:Justin Berrisford: Director Born and raised in White Bear Lake, Justin has always aspired to be a part of something. In his directorial debut he will see his dream come true. Just says, ""It is a joy and honor to be accompanied on this journey with a wonderful cast, crew, contributors and fans to see this succeed. Here's to all the dreamers of the world. I'm making my dream come true and you can too. Never give up.""Cole Meyer: Screenwriter/ProducerSince a young age, Cole wanted to get into the film business. After graduating from Century Community & Technical College with an A.S. Degree in Digital Video Production in 2008 and going onto Metropolitan State University to receive a B.A. in Screenwriting in 2010, Cole has made several short films under his production company Big Bang Productions and has even received several awards. ""Legendary"" is not his first foray into the superhero genre. ""Love Unmasked"", a parody of the Golden Age of comics and the Adam West ""Batman"" TV series, was his first time diving into the world of capes and gaudy costumes. See here:""Legendary"", however, is a more serious, down to earth and dramatic take, and he couldn't be more thrilled writing the episodes and producing this project. Tucker Kloetzke: Actor/Assistant DirectorTucker was born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota and began creating movies when he was only seven years old. Tucker Kloetzke has written, directed, edited and starred in every video and movie that Pendle Productions LLC has produced. He created Pendle Productions LLC as an independent film production company dedicated to producing high-quality entertainment, covering all types of genres, including comedy, horror, action and adventure, romance, and mystery. His film ""The Dead Body"" won the Award of Merit for Short Film at the The Accolades Worldwide Film Festival in 2011.Currently, Pendle Productions only creates shorts but an opportunity to be a part of something this big and expansive, and working alongside and reuniting with friends after a four year break, feels like returning home. Steve Kohler: Lead Designer/ActorSteve has a communications, video, and graphic design background. Also, a graduate of Century College. He has worked with Tucker and Cole in the past on various shorts. After a four year hiatus, the three are excited to be working alongside each other again to make this project the best it can be. Edward Linder: DP/ActorEdward is the founder and owner of TMJ Productions (Too Much Joy). The entertainment company was founded in 1999 and has been involved in everything from film, video, theatre and graphic art. Edward has received awards and accolades as well with his career. Check him out at: http://www.tmjproductions.comChristian Gayle: Visual F/XChristian is a talented freelance visual f/x artist, video editor, camera-operator and filmmaker. His short film ""Trapped"" was entered into the 2011 9th annual Lightsaber Choreography Competition (LCCIX). The competition's panel of judges noted the film for its gritty and realistic style. See here:In April 2013, he founded Creative Gateway Productions. James Paulson: Sound-Operator/Script-SupervisorJames is a screenwriter, filmmaker and an overall swell guy.Cast:

Why You Should Donate To This Project:
 If you're a fan of the Marvel and D.C. cinematic universes, Heroes or comics in general, we feel this web series will be for you. It's got action, comedy, romance but also most of all we wanted to tell character-driven stories. While, yes, Pierce can fly like Superman, Zane can heal himself like Wolverine and both have the power of super-strength, our main objective when creating this was not only put our spin on the superhero genre and give people a reason to come back each week and watch the next episode, but to present a show to the public, that in itself, feels like it exists within our own world. Zane, as stated above, starts out as the quarterback of the his football team. He's got a great girl, life couldn't be better, but then that all changes in an instant. Everything ordinary must be put aside and he must embrace the extraordinary in himself. Like all great heroes, he must answer the call, protect the ones he loves, fight evil wherever it lurks and be the stuff legends are made of. Our goal is to finish the first season with a new season and episodes to follow. Episodes will run a length of 15-20 minutes. Six episodes total for each season. When all episodes are complete and transferred to DVD, viewers will have a chance to decide whether or not they want to watch the episodes separately or altogether as one complete 2-hour movie. We plan to finish all the episodes before October and have the finished product ready to view by or about January 2015. What We Need & What You Get:With your help and support, your donations will be used to pay our talented cast and crew, location fees, costumes, makeup, props, craft services and transportation fees. Your generous donations will also go towards post-production. This ranges from mixing sound, doing ADR if needed, adding visual effects and editing the episodes. We are looking to raise an estimated $5, 000 for this project. With all we have planned and to meet the wages and costs, we will need every dollar to do so.  We are creating an original universe that can next to Marvel's, D.C.'s or other comic brand names' universes. To make this happen--- to achieve our vision--- none of it can be possible without passionate and committed individuals who want to see this through from pre to post-production like us.We have many different incentives for people to give money towards. As each incentive goes up in amount, the prizes get bigger. One of these is the opportunity to have an extra role in the series (must live in Minnesota or Wisconsin however). Other incentives include posters, buttons, T-shirts, DVD copies and more.   Risks & Challenges: As stated, Legendary depends on your help and support. Every dollar counts. We want this to go far beyond a pilot episode or even a teaser or concept trailer. If we do not raise the $5, 000 proposed, many of the things we want to do and have planned will sadly have to stay in the concept stage and the end product will not be as what we intended it to be. Halfway ($2, 500), however, would allow us to do many things we want to do but the $5, 000 or more raised, we feel, will meet all the demands, costs and help out in the long run if any problems arise. As ambitious as we are, we also know technical issues could ensue along with scheduling conflicts, weather changes or various other reasons.

We are all anxious to get started on this and are committed to seeing this project from concept (scripts and storyboards) to the final product but again... it all depends on you to get us there. The Impact:

Each character is forced to make tough choices and decisions; each character goes down paths that lead to interesting twists and turns. And when season one ends, season two really heats up and the consequences for those actions and choices come out to the front. With that in mind, again, the life of Legendary and where it goes from the early stages to final production, depends solely on you.If you want to see an exciting new take on the superhero genre with compelling characters that you can latch onto and care about, Legendary is that and more.

<h3>What's The New Film?<br/>
</h3> <br/><b>It might be called A PROBIOTIC LIFE</b> <b>(working title) but it isn't about probiotics! <br/><br/>It's about what we can do from birth to protect our microbiome for the best possible health.<br/><br/></b><p>The film is a celebration of new discoveries in the human microbiome. The message is simple - to improve our health as a species, perhaps it's time for us to re-learn who we are as human beings. To become aware that we're not just human; we're actually part human, part microbe. If we want better health, maybe it's time for us all to start making choices from birth that benefit the whole human super-organism!
</p>
<p>This is an urgent message right now as many aspects of our modern way of life seems to be impacting our microbiome; from eating processed foods to using anti-bacterial products, from life-saving practices like antibiotic therapies to C-Sections combined with the loss of our close connection with nature.<br/></p>
<p>Many modern-day health problems have been linked in some way to an
imbalance of our human microbiome - everything from allergies,
asthma, diabetes, obesity, bowel disorders, some cancers and because
of a gut-brain connection, even conditions like Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's and autism.</p>
<p>So what will it take to make ourselves and in particular, our kids, stronger, more robust and ultimately resistant to disease? With your support, we hope to find out!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436886798/vyzrhoaqjqdkibrhqmqk.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 430px; height: 430px;""/></p>
<p>As the film
reveals, the most critical time period for the human microbiome is
from birth to infancy as the microbiome stabilizes sometime between
2-3 years of age. This means that how we give birth and feed our
babies plus their microbial exposures during these early years could
play a major part in determining their lifelong health. <br/></p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434448985/vzusxy7rehyx855wbrb6.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 497.199px; height: 335px;""/></p>
<i>(Photo above: Jarrad Marcel, Research Laboratory Coordinator, Argonne National Laboratory, collecting a swab sample from his nephew. Copyright Alto Films Ltd 2015).</i><br/><br/>The film explores what can new parents do to protect a child's developing microbiome and to give that child the strongest possible immune system.<br/><br/><p>After the age of 3, the microbiome
shifts a little over the course of our lives and so there are still
things we could all do to help restore our microbiome. <br/></p>
<p>The film explores the latest science on the impact of diet on the microbiome, including finding out which type of diet might be best for your microbiome, for example, which is more microbe-friendly, paleo, vegetarian or high fibre diets? The film looks at whether or not to take
prebiotics, probiotics or antibiotics, the simple changes we could
make to how we live and why we all perhaps should get more down and
dirty with nature. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436888263/waypl7vdjbsnhx2vjrxz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>(Photo above: Grant Fisher (the little boy on the right) and his family, one of the youngest ever recipients of a fecal transplant that ""cured"" recurrent C-Difficile)<br/><br/>
<p>The film tells emotionally-engaging personal stories; from an Amish
family living in northern Indiana (a community with remarkably low
rates of asthma and allergies) to a family whose infant son was
""cured"" of the debilitating disease C-Difficile after a
fecal transplant (yes, a poo transplant!). The film also looks at the
potential for microbiome-related treatment further down the road for
allergies, asthma and obesity plus conditions such as Parkinson's and autism. <br/></p>
<p>The film also looks at the latest
advances in the medical and scientific worlds like ""gauze-seeding"" of the
microbiome for C-Section babies, probiotic replacement body parts and
fecal transplants plus exciting things that lie around the corner in
terms of designing buildings that are actually good for your
microbes.</p>

<h3>Will It Change The World?</h3>
<p>Anything is possible! We would love the film to become a kind of self-help guide for the species. <br/></p>
<p>We certainly hope it inspires people to make positive changes to their lives. As the film reveals, simple small changes to diet and lifestyle could go a long way to protect, restore and rebalance the human microbiome - these changes could benefit ourselves and our families but also, potentially impact future generations.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We want this to be more than a film, we want to inspire a movement uniting forward-thinkers from around the world. We want these forward-thinkers to tell
their friends in real-life and across social media, so one
simple idea spreads wider and wider - the benefits of starting to live ""a probiotic life"".</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We
need your support to make this happen. Yes, we need money to complete
the film - but more importantly, we need good word of mouth, to spread
the idea across the world. </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Why Are We Doing This?</h3>
<p>Why are spending two years of our lives making a documentary about bacteria? <br/></p>
<p>Honestly, we want to help shape the future. We want to play a small part in ensuring that the next generation
 of children is more robust and more resilient to disease. That way, future generations will be best equipped to deal with whatever health challenges lie ahead. <br/></p>
<p>Isn't that ultimately what everybody wants - for ourselves, our families and our friends and even wider, for whole populations and for future generations to be the healthiest they can possibly be? </p>

<p>
</p>
<p>We are
professional filmmakers. We met at the London Film School where we
trained twenty years ago and since then we've been making films
together.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We
have a strong track record. Over the past six years, we have made
four feature-length films that have been distributed internationally
including <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0854670/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CREDO</a> a psychological thriller (2008, 90 mins - released as<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0854670/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> THE DEVIL's CURSE</a> by Lionsgate in the US), <a href=""http://doulafilm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DOULA! </a>a documentary about
doulas (2010, 60 mins), <a href=""http://freedomforbirth.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FREEDOM FOR BIRTH</a> a documentary about human

<h3>Why Should You Trust Us?</h3>
<p>We
will finish the film no matter what. <br/></p>
<p>If we
raise more than our target - terrific! We'll set some stretch goals.
Every dollar raised will go towards the direct costs of making this project the best it can be. So if we raise more than our
target, we'll spend more money on marketing and promotional materials
to spread the word as far and wide as possible.</p>
<p>And you can trust us with the perks.
We delivered all our perks for our <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/one-world-birth-freedom-for-birth/x/240319#/story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FREEDOM FOR BIRTH </a>and <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/microbirth/x/240319#/story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MICROBIRTH</a>
Indiegogo campaigns to all our contributors on time and on schedule!<br/></p>
<p>And we
really do care about this. We have spent the past year and spent all of our own money to get to this
stage, now we need one big boost and your support to get us over the finish line for maximum global impact! <br/></p>

<h3>Please join us for an amazing adventure into the microbiome. </h3>

</div></div>","NEW VIDEO: Please watch the new pitch video ABOVE featuring world-leading experts talking about the science behind this film!
Who Are We?



We are Toni Harman and Alex Wakeford. We are parents to a 7 year old girl
and we're also award-winning documentary filmmakers. Corny as it might sound, we genuinely want to make films that change the
world.


(Photo Above: Alex Wakeford and Toni Harman  accepting the top prize, the Grand Prix Award for their previous documentary ""Microbirth"" at the Life Sciences Film Festival  in Prague in October 2014. Copyright LSFF 2014)
Our
next project is a feature-length
documentary for worldwide cinema release that we hope could become a kind of self-help plan for the species!



What's The New Film?
 It might be called A PROBIOTIC LIFE (working title) but it isn't about probiotics! It's about what we can do from birth to protect our microbiome for the best possible health.The film is a celebration of new discoveries in the human microbiome. The message is simple - to improve our health as a species, perhaps it's time for us to re-learn who we are as human beings. To become aware that we're not just human; we're actually part human, part microbe. If we want better health, maybe it's time for us all to start making choices from birth that benefit the whole human super-organism!

This is an urgent message right now as many aspects of our modern way of life seems to be impacting our microbiome; from eating processed foods to using anti-bacterial products, from life-saving practices like antibiotic therapies to C-Sections combined with the loss of our close connection with nature.
Many modern-day health problems have been linked in some way to an
imbalance of our human microbiome - everything from allergies,
asthma, diabetes, obesity, bowel disorders, some cancers and because
of a gut-brain connection, even conditions like Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's and autism.
So what will it take to make ourselves and in particular, our kids, stronger, more robust and ultimately resistant to disease? With your support, we hope to find out!


As the film
reveals, the most critical time period for the human microbiome is
from birth to infancy as the microbiome stabilizes sometime between
2-3 years of age. This means that how we give birth and feed our
babies plus their microbial exposures during these early years could
play a major part in determining their lifelong health. 

(Photo above: Jarrad Marcel, Research Laboratory Coordinator, Argonne National Laboratory, collecting a swab sample from his nephew. Copyright Alto Films Ltd 2015).The film explores what can new parents do to protect a child's developing microbiome and to give that child the strongest possible immune system.After the age of 3, the microbiome
shifts a little over the course of our lives and so there are still
things we could all do to help restore our microbiome. 
The film explores the latest science on the impact of diet on the microbiome, including finding out which type of diet might be best for your microbiome, for example, which is more microbe-friendly, paleo, vegetarian or high fibre diets? The film looks at whether or not to take
prebiotics, probiotics or antibiotics, the simple changes we could
make to how we live and why we all perhaps should get more down and
dirty with nature. 

(Photo above: Grant Fisher (the little boy on the right) and his family, one of the youngest ever recipients of a fecal transplant that ""cured"" recurrent C-Difficile)
The film tells emotionally-engaging personal stories; from an Amish
family living in northern Indiana (a community with remarkably low
rates of asthma and allergies) to a family whose infant son was
""cured"" of the debilitating disease C-Difficile after a
fecal transplant (yes, a poo transplant!). The film also looks at the
potential for microbiome-related treatment further down the road for
allergies, asthma and obesity plus conditions such as Parkinson's and autism. 
The film also looks at the latest
advances in the medical and scientific worlds like ""gauze-seeding"" of the
microbiome for C-Section babies, probiotic replacement body parts and
fecal transplants plus exciting things that lie around the corner in
terms of designing buildings that are actually good for your
microbes.

Scientists we have already filmed for this project include professors from Cornell University, New York University, Chicago University, Northwestern University and Kings College London with more scientists lined up to be filmed this summer!

lab at Argonne National Laboratory. Copyright Alto Films Ltd 2015).




Will It Change The World?
Anything is possible! We would love the film to become a kind of self-help guide for the species. 
We certainly hope it inspires people to make positive changes to their lives. As the film reveals, simple small changes to diet and lifestyle could go a long way to protect, restore and rebalance the human microbiome - these changes could benefit ourselves and our families but also, potentially impact future generations.






We want this to be more than a film, we want to inspire a movement uniting forward-thinkers from around the world. We want these forward-thinkers to tell
their friends in real-life and across social media, so one
simple idea spreads wider and wider - the benefits of starting to live ""a probiotic life"".


We
need your support to make this happen. Yes, we need money to complete
the film - but more importantly, we need good word of mouth, to spread
the idea across the world.

Why Are We Doing This?
Why are spending two years of our lives making a documentary about bacteria? 
Honestly, we want to help shape the future. We want to play a small part in ensuring that the next generation
 of children is more robust and more resilient to disease. That way, future generations will be best equipped to deal with whatever health challenges lie ahead. 
Isn't that ultimately what everybody wants - for ourselves, our families and our friends and even wider, for whole populations and for future generations to be the healthiest they can possibly be?

Who Are We To Do This?



We are
professional filmmakers. We met at the London Film School where we
trained twenty years ago and since then we've been making films
together.


We
have a strong track record. Over the past six years, we have made
four feature-length films that have been distributed internationally
including CREDO a psychological thriller (2008, 90 mins - released as THE DEVIL's CURSE by Lionsgate in the US), DOULA! a documentary about
doulas (2010, 60 mins), FREEDOM FOR BIRTH a documentary about human
rights  in childbirth (2012, 60 mins).

Our
last film MICROBIRTH (60 mins, 2014) about how the way we give
birth impacts a baby's lifelong health - won the top prize, the Grand Prix Award, at the Life Sciences Film Festival in Prague. It's
had over 1,000 public screenings all around the world and is now
being distributed internationally. It's sparked massive international
media interest and more importantly, it's changed people's lives. 





Why Should You Trust Us?
We
will finish the film no matter what. 
If we
raise more than our target - terrific! We'll set some stretch goals.
Every dollar raised will go towards the direct costs of making this project the best it can be. So if we raise more than our
target, we'll spend more money on marketing and promotional materials
to spread the word as far and wide as possible.
And you can trust us with the perks.
We delivered all our perks for our FREEDOM FOR BIRTH and MICROBIRTH
Indiegogo campaigns to all our contributors on time and on schedule!
And we
really do care about this. We have spent the past year and spent all of our own money to get to this
stage, now we need one big boost and your support to get us over the finish line for maximum global impact! 





What Do We Need The Money For?





Our
journey so far has taken us from an Amish farm in Indiana to a US
Government Research Lab, from inside homes to operating theatres and
into influential architectural firms. This summer we plan to continue our journey by doing more filming
in Europe and North America. We want to film projects that are unraveling the impact of the gut microbiome on
autism, Parkinson's, allergies and obesity.








We are aiming to premiere A PROBIOTIC LIFE in the Spring of 2016 at a big festival followed by a theatrical release in cinemas!
After what we hope will be a very successful cinema and VOD release, then we'll be opening the film up to you to hold your own public screening (if you choose this perk) in order to spread the message even wider.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>We have already finished actual filming, but the post-production requires some extra funding.

Afterwards, since the project is purely non-commercial, there will be a free release on YouTube.</span></p>
<p>In order to achieve all that we need the minimum of 2,000 $. That sum would allow us to pay our film crew for spending extra time on editing and visual effects, to hire voice actors for English, Polish and Russian voicing and to rent a studio, where voice actors and musicians will be recorded.</p>
<p>Filmed in Lviv, Ukraine, this short is not just a single fruit of our efforts, but it also may the beginning of something much more, if your support exceeds the initial goal. We’re not just talking about traditional extras, exclusive photosets and posters.In case we collect twice the required sum, we will start working on the next Witcher Story — better, longer and even more fascinating.</p>
<p>And even if the funds don’t reach the goal, all the collected money will be used to deliver at least the English version of the film.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>

<p><span>Lost and Found is not an ordinary fan-made film. Our team of dedicated writers, actors, filmmakers and costume designers decided to tell you one more story about Geralt of Rivia and Ciri.  A story about love, doubt and danger.</span></p>
<p>Despite it’s our first project of such kind, the director and cameramen have a decent experience in Ukrainian cinematography. The rest of the team share an equal amount of talent, experience, hard work and love for the Witcher world.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Vaccines are safe, we’re told. 
We hear it from the mainstream news media and from the government we
wish we could trust.  The warnings
are becoming more strident.  They
are telling us there is absolutely no scientific doubt. They are implying that
parents who hesitate to have their children vaccinated or who even question the
safety of vaccines are committing an immoral act. </span><br/></p>
<p>But vaccines aren’t safe.  In
spite of the denials, evidence from honest scientists is showing that vaccines
are dangerous and that the science telling us otherwise has been
corrupted.  For the future of our
children, the true story must be told.</p>
<p>I’m Richard P. Milner. My
background is in network news documentaries for ABC, NBC and PBS. I co-produced
“Fooling with Nature,” a PBS Frontline documentary on endocrine disruptors, a
class of synthetic chemicals that can interfere with many critical processes in
our bodies including fertility. Some of the better known ones are the Dioxins,
PCBs, BPA, and DES.</p>
<p>The program was aired, but that information was
censored because network officials didn’t want to “alarm anyone.”  Still
the program introduced a large audience to the dangers of a class of these chemicals. 
That program took five years from concept to broadcast. 
Since then media censorship has gotten worse.  </p>
<p>Several years ago, I began looking into the possible link
between vaccines and autism. I’m the son of a doctor, so I expected to
find overwhelming proof that there is no link.  Instead, I found the
opposite.  There is a large body of scientific evidence against
vaccination that goes back decades. 
Not only are vaccines not as effective as advertised, they have injured
a very large number of people.  The mainstream media will not touch this
story -- much less give it the comprehensive reporting it calls for.</p>
<p>So I am asking you to help me produce <i>Sick Nation: The Medical Mercury
Health Crisis, </i>a documentary film on the suppressed science of vaccine
dangers.  It will present the evidence and the stories of vaccine
victims.  Your donation will help ensure we can produce this
groundbreaking film.</p>
<p><i>Sick Nation: The Medical Mercury Health Crisis</i> begins with mercury
and aluminum as chief culprits in our pandemic of chronic diseases and
disorders and extends to the many serious poisons in vaccines.  As proposed, the program will use a set
of virtual debates between proponents and critics of vaccines as the method of
telling the vaccine injury story.</p>
<p>I invite you to watch our video, <i>Haley vs. Offit, Do Vaccines Cause
Autism? A Virtual Debate About The Greatest Medical Controversy Of Our Time</i>. 
This video is a small sample of the document we hope to produce.
 It features a discussion between
scientist Boyd Haley, PhD, and vaccine inventor/ pitchman, Paul Offit, MD. 
It offers important insights on what can happen when industry profits, rather
than human health, drive government vaccine recommendations and mandates.</p>
<p>Dr. Offit appears often on national television as an expert on vaccines, but
refuses to debate. By not inviting any of his many critics, the mainstream
media give the impression that he has none. This false impression leaves the
public uninformed on the very real threats posed to children’s health through
an overly aggressive vaccine program that now recommends children receive an
astounding 48 vaccines by the age of six!</p>
<p>Dr. Offit and other forced vaccine proponents claim that the science is
settled, that it overwhelmingly supports the idea that vaccines are very
effective and very safe.  But the reality is different. In spite of
massive industry influence and propaganda, the science directly counters that claim. 
Vaccine proponents and the media simply ignore or suppress the studies, and the
CDC refuses to record new cases of autism linked to vaccination.  (No.
They have two vaccine injury reporting systems, which most doctors don’t
use.  So only one to ten percent of
injuries ever get reported.)</p>
<p>The mainstream media no longer report as they once did. There used to be a
firewall between advertising and news, but that has been gone for some time.
 Pharmaceutical corporations spend $4 billion per year on ads.  Where
a major advertiser or program donor like big Pharma is concerned, media sides
with the money, not with the injured.  </p>
<p>That’s why we need your help to produce the film and sidestep the mainstream
media by promoting and distributing theatrically and over the Internet. Will
you join us?</p>
<p>Vaccines have been controversial since the beginning. And the pharmaceutical
industry has repeatedly lied to us about them.  There is evidence that many vaccines actually cause diseases
and disorders they are meant to prevent, such as polio and measles, or cause
other problems, such as chronic seizures and allergies.  Moreover, vaccines
may make infectious diseases worse by delaying their onset and increasing their
virulence.  </p>
<p>Big pharmaceutical corporations have not only suppressed the vaccine-autism
link, they have also suppressed evidence that vaccines may be a major
contributing factor or principal cause of other neurological problems, Alzheimer’s,
Anaphylactic Shock, Asthma, Autoimmune and Cardiovascular Diseases, Cancer,
Diabetes, Obesity, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Sudden Cardiac
Arrest.  </p>
<p>Since 1986, the US Federal Court of Claims has awarded more than $2.3 billion
compensation for vaccine injuries.  Originally meant as a simple no-fault
procedure, cases today are hotly contested. Parents with limited funds go up
against the US Department of Justice playing every legalistic trick with deep
pockets of taxpayer money.  Leading pharmaceutical companies have paid
billions of dollars to settle fraud accusations.  Yet fines and
settlements appear to be merely a cost of doing business.  These stories
are not reported in depth. </p>
<p>The top five pharmaceutical corporations have net profits exceeding the
remaining 495 Fortune 500 companies combined!  To maintain their
profitability, they’ve made slight variations to drug formulations, all-in-one
vaccines, and delivery systems as patents are about to run out, illegally
promoted off-label uses, paid doctors to sign their names to articles
custom-written by drug marketing departments, and hid information on drug
dangers from the FDA and the public.  Today few new drugs with
billion-dollar profit potential are in the development pipeline. But more than
200 new vaccines are.  Moreover, ever since ratification of The National
Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, corporations have no liability.  </p>
<p>Since 1986, the CDC has been charged with promoting vaccines.  They
have been able to put into place a nationwide Mandatory Childhood Vaccine
Schedule that calls for 69 doses of 16 different vaccines before age 18,
beginning on day of birth. </p>
<p>Pregnant women are being advised to vaccinate, which means mercury and
aluminum exposure during the most vulnerable points of fetal development. 
In most states parents can claim vaccine exemptions.  But with Dr. Offit
leading the charge, national and state legislatures are moving or have moved to
close exemptions, leaving parents no choice but to vaccinate if they want their
child to attend school or daycare.</p>
<p>The myth of vaccine effectiveness is powerful.  Time after time
vaccines have been shown to be not as effective as advertised.  But most
people still believe in them because they only hear the pro-vaccine message. </p>
<p>When vaccines do work, they lose their effect within 2-10 years, making
so-called “herd immunity” impossible.  The term “herd immunity” was
co-opted by the vaccine industry.  Actual herd immunity doesn’t come from
vaccines, but is a status attained by a population after a sufficient number
have been infected naturally and develop immunity naturally--not an immunity of
a few years, but lifetime immunity.</p>
<p>Another myth is that vaccines are free or that the vaccine industry makes
very little money on them.  Taking as an example all children born in
2010, if the vaccine industry can attain a vaccination rate of 90%, they stand
to make $5.273 billion on that group. For the same group, the government stands
to receive $129.023 million in vaccine taxes.  Doctors will make $3,033
per child or $14.615 billion for the group. The pharmaceutical
corporations then make additional billions selling drugs to treat the resulting
sicknesses and disorders to the half of our children who now have a chronic medical
condition.</p>
<p>Why would these corporations put the health of children above profits? 
They’ve captured the CDC, which promotes their product at no cost to them, and
they can’t be sued.  One way to stop them is with education, the same as
it was with exposing the link between smoking and cancer.  We need to
disseminate the facts as widely and forcefully and often as possible.  </p>

<p></p></div>","Vaccines are safe, we’re told. 
We hear it from the mainstream news media and from the government we
wish we could trust.  The warnings
are becoming more strident.  They
are telling us there is absolutely no scientific doubt. They are implying that
parents who hesitate to have their children vaccinated or who even question the
safety of vaccines are committing an immoral act. 
But vaccines aren’t safe.  In
spite of the denials, evidence from honest scientists is showing that vaccines
are dangerous and that the science telling us otherwise has been
corrupted.  For the future of our
children, the true story must be told.
I’m Richard P. Milner. My
background is in network news documentaries for ABC, NBC and PBS. I co-produced
“Fooling with Nature,” a PBS Frontline documentary on endocrine disruptors, a
class of synthetic chemicals that can interfere with many critical processes in
our bodies including fertility. Some of the better known ones are the Dioxins,
PCBs, BPA, and DES.
The program was aired, but that information was
censored because network officials didn’t want to “alarm anyone.”  Still
the program introduced a large audience to the dangers of a class of these chemicals. 
That program took five years from concept to broadcast. 
Since then media censorship has gotten worse.  
Several years ago, I began looking into the possible link
between vaccines and autism. I’m the son of a doctor, so I expected to
find overwhelming proof that there is no link.  Instead, I found the
opposite.  There is a large body of scientific evidence against
vaccination that goes back decades. 
Not only are vaccines not as effective as advertised, they have injured
a very large number of people.  The mainstream media will not touch this
story -- much less give it the comprehensive reporting it calls for.
So I am asking you to help me produce Sick Nation: The Medical Mercury
Health Crisis, a documentary film on the suppressed science of vaccine
dangers.  It will present the evidence and the stories of vaccine
victims.  Your donation will help ensure we can produce this
groundbreaking film.
Sick Nation: The Medical Mercury Health Crisis begins with mercury
and aluminum as chief culprits in our pandemic of chronic diseases and
disorders and extends to the many serious poisons in vaccines.  As proposed, the program will use a set
of virtual debates between proponents and critics of vaccines as the method of
telling the vaccine injury story.
I invite you to watch our video, Haley vs. Offit, Do Vaccines Cause
Autism? A Virtual Debate About The Greatest Medical Controversy Of Our Time. 
This video is a small sample of the document we hope to produce.
 It features a discussion between
scientist Boyd Haley, PhD, and vaccine inventor/ pitchman, Paul Offit, MD. 
It offers important insights on what can happen when industry profits, rather
than human health, drive government vaccine recommendations and mandates.
Dr. Offit appears often on national television as an expert on vaccines, but
refuses to debate. By not inviting any of his many critics, the mainstream
media give the impression that he has none. This false impression leaves the
public uninformed on the very real threats posed to children’s health through
an overly aggressive vaccine program that now recommends children receive an
astounding 48 vaccines by the age of six!
Dr. Offit and other forced vaccine proponents claim that the science is
settled, that it overwhelmingly supports the idea that vaccines are very
effective and very safe.  But the reality is different. In spite of
massive industry influence and propaganda, the science directly counters that claim. 
Vaccine proponents and the media simply ignore or suppress the studies, and the
CDC refuses to record new cases of autism linked to vaccination.  (No.
They have two vaccine injury reporting systems, which most doctors don’t
use.  So only one to ten percent of
injuries ever get reported.)
The mainstream media no longer report as they once did. There used to be a
firewall between advertising and news, but that has been gone for some time.
 Pharmaceutical corporations spend $4 billion per year on ads.  Where
a major advertiser or program donor like big Pharma is concerned, media sides
with the money, not with the injured.  
That’s why we need your help to produce the film and sidestep the mainstream
media by promoting and distributing theatrically and over the Internet. Will
you join us?
Vaccines have been controversial since the beginning. And the pharmaceutical
industry has repeatedly lied to us about them.  There is evidence that many vaccines actually cause diseases
and disorders they are meant to prevent, such as polio and measles, or cause
other problems, such as chronic seizures and allergies.  Moreover, vaccines
may make infectious diseases worse by delaying their onset and increasing their
virulence.  
Big pharmaceutical corporations have not only suppressed the vaccine-autism
link, they have also suppressed evidence that vaccines may be a major
contributing factor or principal cause of other neurological problems, Alzheimer’s,
Anaphylactic Shock, Asthma, Autoimmune and Cardiovascular Diseases, Cancer,
Diabetes, Obesity, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Sudden Cardiac
Arrest.  
Since 1986, the US Federal Court of Claims has awarded more than $2.3 billion
compensation for vaccine injuries.  Originally meant as a simple no-fault
procedure, cases today are hotly contested. Parents with limited funds go up
against the US Department of Justice playing every legalistic trick with deep
pockets of taxpayer money.  Leading pharmaceutical companies have paid
billions of dollars to settle fraud accusations.  Yet fines and
settlements appear to be merely a cost of doing business.  These stories

<h3>the opportunity</h3>We suddenly have 
an opportunity to apply for a ""Good to Great"" grant from the state of 
Connecticut. This special grant, offered for the first time, will 
provide historic sites with up-to $125,000 for a <i>transformative </i>change 
-- in our case, this change would be to restore the historic New London Harbor 'Pequot' Lighthouse 
dock so that we, visitors, and the US Coast Guard can get to Harbor Light by boat! <br/><br/>The 
dock is estimated to cost about $175,000. The grant would pay up-to 
$125,000 but requires a 25% match at the time of the application. If we apply for the full amount, that
 match would be $31,250. This total would get us pretty close to being 
able to complete the entire dock project.<br/><br/>This offer also means that every one dollar contributed to this campaign is matched x 4  by the grant to equal $5!<br/><br/>The grant was 
announced on June 11. The
 matching funds must be in-hand at the time of the application: July 11, 2015. But whatever the grant outcome, we will go ahead with the dock!<br/><br/>New London Harbor 'Pequot' Light is the oldest and tallest lighthouse on Long Island Sound.
 According to the US Coast Guard, from the lantern at Pequot Light, one 
can see more lighthouse than from any other place on earth! Don't you want to see that?!<br/><br/><h3>the offer</h3>Every contribution is appreciated and we thank you for considering this effort to keep a beloved icon open to the public. <br/>We have a number of Perks available (see right), but it's your support that matters most. There is strength in numbers. If we each contribute just a small amount, we will get there.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>the issue</h3>Yes, there is a serious issue we now have to discuss.<br/>If it were not for a temporary injunction issued on June 19, 2015, we could not get to our own lighthouse! The new neighbors on both sides of the lighthouse are preventing our access and costing us a great deal of money in legal fees.<br/><br/>New London Maritime Society believes that you--the American public-- built the lighthouses. You own the lighthouses (through us -- a non-profit 501(c) 3 charitable organization, which is steward of three lighthouses, and which is overseen by the National Park Service). And you deserve to have access to the lighthouses. Lighthouses are our history. As one European visitor put it, they are America’s castles.<br/><br/><b>This is the 15th anniversary of the National Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000.</b> In the history of the Act, no single organization has 
even been awarded ownership of three lighthouses -- and may I add, three
 such <i>spectacular </i>lighthouses: New London Harbor 'Pequot', Race Rock, and New London Ledge Lights. New London Maritime Society, with its 
educational 'Lighthouse Kids' programs, boat tours, partnerships in the 
community, and special events, is the poster child for Lighthouse 
Preservation.<br/><br/>In fact,<b> New London Harbor Light was among the first group of six 
lighthouses offered for disposal by the GSA in 2002 </b>-- 
The New London Maritime Society applied for the lighthouse in 2002 and Harbor 
Light was awarded to the Society soon thereafter. The actual 
conveyance ceremony took place eight years later in October 2010.  <b>This Lighthouse Matters!<br/><div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Currently NLMS is defending the rights of the public to have access to their
lighthouses in court! In a lawsuit filed by a neighbor to Harbor Light, our
lawyers have filed a 'Motion to Dismiss' which argues in favor of federal primacy in
all zoning disputes with these historic American beacons. If this
motion is granted, we will have won a battle for all civic groups working to
preserve their local lighthouses.<br/>
<br/>
Across five years of programming, New London Maritime Society has successfully established New London, Connecticut, as a true 'Lighthouse Hub. People now recognize the city has a wealth of diverse lighthouses just off shore. Businesses promote the idea, our director was awarded Elk's 2015 'Citizen of the Year' and the Society received formal recognition from New London's Economic Development Commission for it's work to turn New London into a 'Lighthouse Hub'. We are supported by a terrific board of trustees<b>, </b>who are workers and givers to this campaign. At our board meeting on Thursday, June 25, trustees pledged cash &amp; check donations for 12 planks not recorded on this on-line tally!<br/></p>
<h3></h3>

Like the City of New London itself, the New London Maritime Society is small, poor, and understaffed. But we are
trying to make things a little better in the world. Preserving these historic
shared community icons, maintaining the public's right to access these landmarks, and working to support the US Coast Guard -- which still maintains the lanterns to keep our mariners
safe -- is something we feel we can do.<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NewLondonHarborLight?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
</div></b><h3></h3>
<h3>the other issue</h3>We have been successful at establishing New London as the region's 'Lighthouse Hub'. One way we did this was with a successful program of lighthouse boat tours. These trips are our single most-successful fund-raising activity. <br/>But this summer we are facing competition in the lighthouse tour category. This is not a bad thing because at our core we believe in and advocate for lighthouse and history education. However, to continue to earn the donations necessary to restore and maintain our lighthouses, we need to keep our tours successful. One good way to do that is to differentiate what we offer. Already our Sunset and Full-Moon tours are unique. By adding some tours that can land at the dock at Harbor Lighthouse to visit inside the lighthouse <i>by boat </i>we will be able to offer another unique experience. <br/>The dock also will bypass the problems we currently are having with both our neighbors, who are preventing our access by land to the lighthouse.<br/>We really need that dock!<br/><br/><h3>the challenges</h3>
</div><div>Restoring the historic dock at the lighthouse and exercising our riparian rights will allow us access to the lighthouse during reasonable weather and when we can afford to hire one of our local captains to ferry us over. But we still have a long haul ahead of us with the legal issues with our neighbors to establish a path by land. We fear that the neighbor bringing the lawsuit can tie up this little non-profit for quite some time -- and this appears to be the plan.<br/><br/>We do believe that our rights will be upheld in court, and with that battle won, we'll have struck a blow for all lighthouse friends groups. We also will have made the option of adopting a lighthouse a bit less daunting for other groups like us, who fear this kind of treatment from NIMBY neighbors on the waterfront!<br/><br/><h3>want to help?<br/>
</h3>There are ways to help other than to contribute:</div><div> <ul> <li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.</li> <li>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li> </ul> </div> <p>Thank you!<br/></p></div>","the opportunityWe suddenly have

$125,000 but requires a 25% match at the time of the application. If we apply for the full amount, that
 match would be $31,250. This total would get us pretty close to being 
able to complete the entire dock project.This offer also means that every one dollar contributed to this campaign is matched x 4  by the grant to equal $5!The grant was 
announced on June 11. The
 matching funds must be in-hand at the time of the application: July 11, 2015. But whatever the grant outcome, we will go ahead with the dock!New London Harbor 'Pequot' Light is the oldest and tallest lighthouse on Long Island Sound.
 According to the US Coast Guard, from the lantern at Pequot Light, one 
can see more lighthouse than from any other place on earth! Don't you want to see that?!the offerEvery contribution is appreciated and we thank you for considering this effort to keep a beloved icon open to the public. We have a number of Perks available (see right), but it's your support that matters most. There is strength in numbers. If we each contribute just a small amount, we will get there.
  the issueYes, there is a serious issue we now have to discuss.If it were not for a temporary injunction issued on June 19, 2015, we could not get to our own lighthouse! The new neighbors on both sides of the lighthouse are preventing our access and costing us a great deal of money in legal fees.New London Maritime Society believes that you--the American public-- built the lighthouses. You own the lighthouses (through us -- a non-profit 501(c) 3 charitable organization, which is steward of three lighthouses, and which is overseen by the National Park Service). And you deserve to have access to the lighthouses. Lighthouses are our history. As one European visitor put it, they are America’s castles.This is the 15th anniversary of the National Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000. In the history of the Act, no single organization has 
even been awarded ownership of three lighthouses -- and may I add, three
 such spectacular lighthouses: New London Harbor 'Pequot', Race Rock, and New London Ledge Lights. New London Maritime Society, with its 
educational 'Lighthouse Kids' programs, boat tours, partnerships in the 
community, and special events, is the poster child for Lighthouse 
Preservation.In fact, New London Harbor Light was among the first group of six 
lighthouses offered for disposal by the GSA in 2002 -- 
The New London Maritime Society applied for the lighthouse in 2002 and Harbor 
Light was awarded to the Society soon thereafter. The actual 
conveyance ceremony took place eight years later in October 2010.  This Lighthouse Matters!

Currently NLMS is defending the rights of the public to have access to their
lighthouses in court! In a lawsuit filed by a neighbor to Harbor Light, our
lawyers have filed a 'Motion to Dismiss' which argues in favor of federal primacy in
all zoning disputes with these historic American beacons. If this
motion is granted, we will have won a battle for all civic groups working to
preserve their local lighthouses.

Across five years of programming, New London Maritime Society has successfully established New London, Connecticut, as a true 'Lighthouse Hub. People now recognize the city has a wealth of diverse lighthouses just off shore. Businesses promote the idea, our director was awarded Elk's 2015 'Citizen of the Year' and the Society received formal recognition from New London's Economic Development Commission for it's work to turn New London into a 'Lighthouse Hub'. We are supported by a terrific board of trustees, who are workers and givers to this campaign. At our board meeting on Thursday, June 25, trustees pledged cash & check donations for 12 planks not recorded on this on-line tally!


Like the City of New London itself, the New London Maritime Society is small, poor, and understaffed. But we are
trying to make things a little better in the world. Preserving these historic
shared community icons, maintaining the public's right to access these landmarks, and working to support the US Coast Guard -- which still maintains the lanterns to keep our mariners
safe -- is something we feel we can do.

the other issueWe have been successful at establishing New London as the region's 'Lighthouse Hub'. One way we did this was with a successful program of lighthouse boat tours. These trips are our single most-successful fund-raising activity. But this summer we are facing competition in the lighthouse tour category. This is not a bad thing because at our core we believe in and advocate for lighthouse and history education. However, to continue to earn the donations necessary to restore and maintain our lighthouses, we need to keep our tours successful. One good way to do that is to differentiate what we offer. Already our Sunset and Full-Moon tours are unique. By adding some tours that can land at the dock at Harbor Lighthouse to visit inside the lighthouse by boat we will be able to offer another unique experience. The dock also will bypass the problems we currently are having with both our neighbors, who are preventing our access by land to the lighthouse.We really need that dock!the challenges
Restoring the historic dock at the lighthouse and exercising our riparian rights will allow us access to the lighthouse during reasonable weather and when we can afford to hire one of our local captains to ferry us over. But we still have a long haul ahead of us with the legal issues with our neighbors to establish a path by land. We fear that the neighbor bringing the lawsuit can tie up this little non-profit for quite some time -- and this appears to be the plan.We do believe that our rights will be upheld in court, and with that battle won, we'll have struck a blow for all lighthouse friends groups. We also will have made the option of adopting a lighthouse a bit less daunting for other groups like us, who fear this kind of treatment from NIMBY neighbors on the waterfront!want to help?

Colonel, Stanislav Petrov saved the world on September 26th, 1983.
Few people know him, but every person on the planet was affected by his actions that September night: The Soviet Nuclear Early Warning Center reported that the United States launched five nuclear missiles, and in 40 minutes they would hit their targets in Russia. Petrov was on duty that night and in the moments that followed, he overruled the system's warning, personally declaring that it was a false alarm. He went against military protocol and refused to retaliate, until he could confirmn the moments that followed, he overruled the system's warning, personally see eclaring that it was a false alarm. He went against military protocol and refused to retaliate, until he could  the missiles in the sky with his own eyes. They never came and because of his decision we are all alive today.
This false nuclear attack warning is cited by CIA analyst Peter Pry as ""the single most dangerous incident of the early 1980s.""
The film also tells the story of how the man who saved us all –  a man broken by the system, a man who for decades were unable to overcome his own downfall – learns to face his personal demons and ultimately finds redemption.



""All in all, this might just be one of the most important films of our time! Maybe even of all time!""  5 Stars –The Fancarpet.com.



The events of September 26, 1983 remain a stark example of the precarious situation we still find ourselves in. There are over 3000 nuclear missiles on hair trigger alert today; close calls and mistakes happen – more often than you think...With tension building around the nuclear agreement in Iran, threats from North Korea, nuclear tension between India and Pakistan it is important that we all join the conversation and voice our opinion.
Stanislav Petrov's courageous decision deserves recognition and you can help shine a light on the issue. By bringing the film to a wide audience, you can participate in the prevailing, global discussion on nuclear weapons and help make a difference. We have partnered with numerous organizations to help further the current debate on nuclear weapons, to engage public opinion, and to facilitate international policy change.

<p>The team

doctors  and phds in science...  we are more romantic and rebelious bunch and
we are happy with that,  because only
romantics have done, are doing and always will do  breakthoughs findings for civilization. In truth, we don’t even have experience in making documentaries. But we have a lot of energy and a great will to do it !</p>
<p>Always be
open-minded to new revolutionary bits of information and knowledge in general.
Do not be afraid to explore, talk and discuss something new, unusual, sometimes
mind boggling.  Then and only then
nothing and no-one would be able to stop the progress on our planet !  </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>OUR GOAL</h3>
<div>
<p>We want to conduct a large, independent study of the
history of the planet Earth and human civilization (how it actually happened).
As a result shoot a great documentary film, which will depict the most
interesting and controversial mysteries of Earth's civilization. Everything in
the film will be greatly supported with facts which in turn will not leave the
audience wondering if its  another
fiction. </p>
<p>Humanity must know the truth about its’ past and the
past of the planet. We can not stick our heads in the sand when another fact
emerges, thus causing one to doubt generally accepted ""historical theory""
of the origin of modern civilization (and ancient: the Sumerians, Maya, ancient
Egypt, and the like).</p>
<p>The past. What do we know about it?</p>
<p>How real is the historical theory, which we are taught
in schools?</p>
<p>Is  ""Darwin’s"" generally accepted theory
 true? </p>
<p>How long does humanity exists on our planet?</p>
<p>And many other questions in doubt.</p>
<p>Perhaps each of us asked at least on one of the above
questions, or heard about them. Why are there so many artifacts (which
conveniently are considered fake), historical chronicles (so called myths) that
do not correspond to what is written in the books.</p>
<p>Below is a selection of the most ""harmless""
films about controversy in  official
science:</p>

<div>
<p>Many of you probably have a question - why such a
strange figure on the project budget, $ 1,981,600, it has arisen from our
calculation and this figure is accurate. With this money we plan to conduct the
expedition and research in 15 countries + Antarctica Expedition which will be
the most expensive. In each of the countries we are planning to spend <b>AT LEAST 14
days</b>, in which we will visit all the most famous and mysterious places, conduct
research of artifacts and megalithic structures, shoot interviews with
prominent scientists in these countries, going to send  all  found artifacts for the examination . At the end of our trip
(which will end at least in 12 months), expeditionary activities and the filmed
materials we will transgress to the structuring of knowledge and mount
documentary. It will take us about 6 months. Total minimum term of the project :
18 months, the minimum budget of $ 1,981,600. </p>
<p>That is the minimum because in
the process there are going to appear a lot of additional facts that we might
want to study, some deeper than others. It is like ""Disney Worldwee""
you always plan to spend some money, but often go beyond what is permitted,
because of the large number of temptations :))</p>

Hi guys!
My name is
Mikhail Yusupov. Nice to meet you all !
WE ARE NOT
GOING TO TELL YOU A LONG STORY ABOUT US - ENTHUSIASTS, NOT SILLY GUYS, A LITTLE
REBELLIOUS. IN GENERAL, ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE YOU :)
The team
that we have doesn’t  solely consists of
doctors  and phds in science...  we are more romantic and rebelious bunch and
we are happy with that,  because only
romantics have done, are doing and always will do  breakthoughs findings for civilization. In truth, we don’t even have experience in making documentaries. But we have a lot of energy and a great will to do it !
Always be
open-minded to new revolutionary bits of information and knowledge in general.
Do not be afraid to explore, talk and discuss something new, unusual, sometimes
mind boggling.  Then and only then
nothing and no-one would be able to stop the progress on our planet !  


ALL GREAT
DISCOVERIES HAVE BEEN MADE BY 
“ROMANTIC REVOLUTIONARIES” FROM SCIENCE!

   OUR GOAL

We want to conduct a large, independent study of the
history of the planet Earth and human civilization (how it actually happened).
As a result shoot a great documentary film, which will depict the most
interesting and controversial mysteries of Earth's civilization. Everything in
the film will be greatly supported with facts which in turn will not leave the
audience wondering if its  another
fiction. 
Humanity must know the truth about its’ past and the
past of the planet. We can not stick our heads in the sand when another fact
emerges, thus causing one to doubt generally accepted ""historical theory""
of the origin of modern civilization (and ancient: the Sumerians, Maya, ancient
Egypt, and the like).
The past. What do we know about it?
How real is the historical theory, which we are taught
in schools?
Is  ""Darwin’s"" generally accepted theory
 true? 
How long does humanity exists on our planet?
And many other questions in doubt.
Perhaps each of us asked at least on one of the above
questions, or heard about them. Why are there so many artifacts (which
conveniently are considered fake), historical chronicles (so called myths) that
do not correspond to what is written in the books.
Below is a selection of the most ""harmless""
films about controversy in  official
science:
 «The Young Age of the Earth»

«The Mysterious Origins of Man»

  
«Ica Stones» 

Believe me, there are a lot of films like those, and
even more facts. For example - what do you know about the pyramids? That they
exist only in Egypt and South America? But they are both in China and Europe,
and according to some reports, in the heart of the Bermuda Triangle, as well as
Antarctica.

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>F.P.S. Fred: Genesis</h3>
<div>Hello again, it's your writer and director Grey. Now, F.P.S. Fred comes from a dark place... literally not figuratively- as in I was in a dark room when I wrote it. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Going off to college meant getting a new laptop and my goal was to make sure my parents got me one powerful enough to game. We'd never had a family computer powerful enough for gaming, so up to this point I was strictly on consoles and handhelds (and look I didn't turn out so bad *twitches*) neither of which I could take to my dorm with me. Of course, it didn't take long for the internet to oh so formally introduce me to Steam. I literally had to call Andrew Chenault (our camera operator) at 1 AM IN THE MORNING to let him know- no more like to enlighten- no more like to save his life by alerting him that there was an online store practically giving games away. He sleepily groaned, said he'd known about it, and hung up. So that night I made my first Steam purchase, one of 2012's biggest hits, Borderlands 2 and its predecessor with all the DLC included. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div> The Borderlands franchise holds a ton of my freshman year hours. Great style, great writing, and pinpoint in knowing what kind of game it is. On the flip side, my Winter quarter schedule consisted of an Intro to Screenwriting class. I figured this class would be easy- the reason I got into filmmaking (a whole other long story) was because of writing and by this time I'd already written three feature length screenplays and a web series. But that was a problem- three FEATURE LENGTHS and a SERIES. This class wanted me to produce a SHORT (20 pages or less). The first draft of my first screenplay ever ran about 170 pages. Like many of us writers I have issues with condensing vivid ideas as well as cutting my baby to shreds once it's written. Not only that but my Professor (shoutout to Jon Beaupre!) challenged us to explore territory we hadn't set foot in, to dabble into something or someone weird to us. To say the least, this class was hard for me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So the day comes when I have to submit a draft. I have one class in the afternoon and then the screenwriting class in the evening. On the night before with still no 20 page ideas or anything written I do what any responsible escapist would do- I binge game  Borderlands 2 through the night/morning until my afternoon class. But something strange happened when I got up out of my seat to leave. I could still see the health bar from Borderlands 2- I could still see the whole Heads Up Display- like the image was burned into my head, an eye spot unwilling to fade away. So I... accepted it. I even began to swivel my head smoothly as if I were someone else camera. I got dressed that way, ate that way, and went to class that way. Of course, this imaginary HUD faded eventually but it made me think.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>What if someone could subject themselves to that? What if someone was so displeased with life, so disillusioned with monotony, so caught up in the thought that ""hey, of all the universes we got the most boring one"" they implement a self-inficted psychosis? And, most importantly, how do they find their way back- if they ever do or ever can? Those questions are the bedrock of Freddie Fresno's existence- he's here to answer them- I wrote him to answer them. This is a story for those not just looking for <b>something</b> out of life but something much, much, <b>greater</b> out it. With the seasoning of a few personal plights to round out and deepen my characters it only took about an hour to finish the script- ridden with typos- but a script nonetheless. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I knew immediately I wanted to make it.</div>

<p>Seasoned is an understatement when referring to the film's Assistant Director Jacob Gray. As a writer and director as well, Jacob charged boldly into the world of filmmaking in 2014 with his first short film- self-produced and self-financed he succeeded in creating something from nothing. Shortly afterward, his music video directorial debut ""Judas/Aurora"" with Long Beach collective The Natives has received broad unanimous acclaim- especially from the locals of Long Beach for his visually stunning portrayal of the city. </p>

Wide eyes. Endless questions. Nothing to lose. Tabula rasa.


A kid. 

The ruggedness of talent can lead to stumbling of the heart, the rawness of potential can fog the mind, and blind ambition can yield disruptive relentlessness. 

And it is difficult to stop a kid once resolute with an idea. It becomes exponentially more difficult once you've taught that kid to write. It becomes impossible to stop that kid once they've rallied the others.But, oh, how easy it is to help that kid. How they will ride the inertia from the smallest push. How simple it is to spark ambition within them. The only nourishment they require is criticism and words of wisdom. The only space they need to create is the width and length of a desk. They can build from nothing. They can discover in darkness. Success moves them forward. Failure moves them forward. Only forward.


   F.P.S. Fred: Genesis
Hello again, it's your writer and director Grey. Now, F.P.S. Fred comes from a dark place... literally not figuratively- as in I was in a dark room when I wrote it. 

Going off to college meant getting a new laptop and my goal was to make sure my parents got me one powerful enough to game. We'd never had a family computer powerful enough for gaming, so up to this point I was strictly on consoles and handhelds (and look I didn't turn out so bad *twitches*) neither of which I could take to my dorm with me. Of course, it didn't take long for the internet to oh so formally introduce me to Steam. I literally had to call Andrew Chenault (our camera operator) at 1 AM IN THE MORNING to let him know- no more like to enlighten- no more like to save his life by alerting him that there was an online store practically giving games away. He sleepily groaned, said he'd known about it, and hung up. So that night I made my first Steam purchase, one of 2012's biggest hits, Borderlands 2 and its predecessor with all the DLC included. 

 The Borderlands franchise holds a ton of my freshman year hours. Great style, great writing, and pinpoint in knowing what kind of game it is. On the flip side, my Winter quarter schedule consisted of an Intro to Screenwriting class. I figured this class would be easy- the reason I got into filmmaking (a whole other long story) was because of writing and by this time I'd already written three feature length screenplays and a web series. But that was a problem- three FEATURE LENGTHS and a SERIES. This class wanted me to produce a SHORT (20 pages or less). The first draft of my first screenplay ever ran about 170 pages. Like many of us writers I have issues with condensing vivid ideas as well as cutting my baby to shreds once it's written. Not only that but my Professor (shoutout to Jon Beaupre!) challenged us to explore territory we hadn't set foot in, to dabble into something or someone weird to us. To say the least, this class was hard for me.

So the day comes when I have to submit a draft. I have one class in the afternoon and then the screenwriting class in the evening. On the night before with still no 20 page ideas or anything written I do what any responsible escapist would do- I binge game  Borderlands 2 through the night/morning until my afternoon class. But something strange happened when I got up out of my seat to leave. I could still see the health bar from Borderlands 2- I could still see the whole Heads Up Display- like the image was burned into my head, an eye spot unwilling to fade away. So I... accepted it. I even began to swivel my head smoothly as if I were someone else camera. I got dressed that way, ate that way, and went to class that way. Of course, this imaginary HUD faded eventually but it made me think.

What if someone could subject themselves to that? What if someone was so displeased with life, so disillusioned with monotony, so caught up in the thought that ""hey, of all the universes we got the most boring one"" they implement a self-inficted psychosis? And, most importantly, how do they find their way back- if they ever do or ever can? Those questions are the bedrock of Freddie Fresno's existence- he's here to answer them- I wrote him to answer them. This is a story for those not just looking for something out of life but something much, much, greater out it. With the seasoning of a few personal plights to round out and deepen my characters it only took about an hour to finish the script- ridden with typos- but a script nonetheless. 

I knew immediately I wanted to make it.

Inside Look at Incentives



    Some more of the Cast/Crew 


 
Seasoned is an understatement when referring to the film's Assistant Director Jacob Gray. As a writer and director as well, Jacob charged boldly into the world of filmmaking in 2014 with his first short film- self-produced and self-financed he succeeded in creating something from nothing. Shortly afterward, his music video directorial debut ""Judas/Aurora"" with Long Beach collective The Natives has received broad unanimous acclaim- especially from the locals of Long Beach for his visually stunning portrayal of the city. 


Our 2nd Assistant Director, Linda Huynh is a Film major and Art minor who will... get you to vote? Linda's extensive work with Advancing Justice keeps her involved in community building, fundraising, and campaigning.  Believe it or not, her worlds overlap. Her skills in organizing events and making sure that all things run effectively and on time are what makes her a successful 2nd AD. But don't let her political awareness fool you, Linda is an avid photographer and budding cinematographer with a director's brag sheet chalk full of Public Service Announcements.

 
  Star Garrett Vanderwielen is a man who channels hilarious antics through many a forms. As a personality, editor, and award-winning animator he's best known for his YouTube channel ""AngryGingersnApps"" and his work on the hit web series ""The Most Popular Girls in School""
The multi-talented Zeno Robinson makes no secret of his interesting pursuits- acting, making music, and writing.  With Grey needing to fill the relatively small role of Dexter as soon as possible for Phase 1, Zeno was referred. However, after only a few conversations between the two new friends revealing him to be an avid gamer, his relatability to the script, and incredible performance he was swiftly given a lead role for the production of Phase 2.

Tiffany Chu's photogenicity is no secret. Her pursuit of acting has followed her through the three short years it took for her to complete her BA at UCI. So why is she serving as script supervisor for F.P.S. Fred? Because Tiffany is just as interested in what goes on behind the camera. Seeing the significance of every cog and gear that goes into making proper moving picture when she's not in front of the camera Tiffany is learning something new about the art of filmmaking.

Andrew Chenault initially began his college trek majoring in video game design but soon realized the versatility of the creative outlet that is film- and his eye for it. Being a long time gamer and now student of cinema made him the ideal candidate for camera operation- point- all of Freddie's Point of View sequences were shot by him. Now, other than his writing, he's currently apart of the largest feature length film ever to be produced solely by UCI students and is a videographer for the university's Anteater TV. 


Lucas Benitez is another victim to the high school film bug. His combined passion for literature, poetry, prose, and all writing of excellence and the unparalleled ""wow"" factor of movie magic (one of his favorites being Jurassic Park) really meant there was only one path for him- the cinema. Lucas is able to separate these worlds as he pleases being one of the chief editors of Statement Magazine, CSULA’s journal for literature and art, while at the same time being Treasurer of Cinematic Visions, CSULA's film club. But of course, he always inevitably brings them together, writing and directing his own works- his most current being a documentary on the late Sal Castro and the Chicano Youth Leadership Conference.


Alan Chung is well known for his cinematography through his projects with PaperSketch Media and Wong Fu Productions. He's currently the Director of Photography of the largest feature length film produced by UCI students.Want to know where we got our equipment?

<div>Thank you so much for taking the time to read about this cause and the very personal and passionate meaning behind The August Project. </div>
<div>My name is Chelsea. I am a full time single mother of a beautiful, 3 year old little girl. I am a certified School Counselor, licensed Professional Counselor Intern, and carry a Masters Degree in Counseling and Higher Education. I am intelligent, educated and was a successful school counselor when my life was turned upside down. You never know who life decides to take a hit at. And, you never know when. In the span of one year, my marriage and my family had fallen apart; I was in a very dangerous environment; I was planning an escape; was diagnosed with 3 autoimmune diseases and was facing some of the most stressful and emotionally torturing times of my life. Within the next year- both of my parents had become terminally ill and the ""unknown"" was more colorful than I had ever seen. </div>
<div>On March 13th, 2010, I was wearing a gorgeous white dress and in front of all of our family and friends, I walked down the aisle and vowed my life to a man I had known nearly 4 years.  I became pregnant that fall and what should have been a beautiful and innately safe experience and one that every mother- to -be should experience, became my own living nightmare. My world was slowly turning upside down and being twisted in ways that I never knew it could be.  By the grace of God and the undying love I have for my daughter, I escaped that nightmare and never went back. </div>
<div>I am a proud and ambitious survivor of domestic abuse and a proud and ambitious survivor as a single mother. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">The journey into becoming a single mother brought more heartache, hopelessness and disappointment than I would have ever imagined.  There is a significant lack of resources available to EFFECTIVELY HELP a single mother during crisis and after. Yes, there are organizations out there that will purchase school supplies, clothing and direct you to the local food pantries. These services and organizations are a God send. I went to every food pantry that I could and received clothing for my daughter and I am grateful for those resources. </span>
</div>
<div>I found myself feeling more hopeless as time went on.  There were and are resources and services that I needed and these were things that I would ALWAYS need help with. It wasn't a one time thing. It wasn't a 3 month thing. It was a 3 year thing.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>I found the name of The August Project as I lived through many experiences, trials, challenges and successes along the journey of becoming a single mom. As we all know, the month of August is the 8th month of the year. Over a span of time, I came to learn that the number 8 means ""new beginnings"" in the Bible. The number 8, the month of August, and new beginnings have been a significant part of the journey. In fact, one of the shelters and counseling centers that my daughter and I escaped to was called ""New Beginnings"". It all just fit. And it fit naturally. </div>
<div> These are services and resources that are custom to being a single mother. I needed continued help. And I needed a lot of it. Unfortunately, the resources are not available for the custom type of services that single mothers truly need from the point of crisis and in moving forward. Your donation and belief in this Non-Profit Organization will provide services and resources that are vital to single mothers everywhere and will help us to raise empowered, confident, successful and healthy children. </div>
<div>The services and resources that The August Project will be providing to single mothers and children include Virtual Counseling, Legal Advocacy, Care for Pets (T.A.P. for Pets), Financial assistance; fully furnished temporary housing; temporary cars/vans/trucks with insurance coverage included; discounts on hotel stays for the ""escapes"" that many women have to endure if they are in an abusive relationship; a 24/7 mentoring program; daily/weekly/monthly blogs and newsletters providing extensive support and updated resources available in the community and surrounding areas; and continued education and on-call support during the different stages of the separation and divorce-including post-divorce care. We will be implementing an on-call service with doorstep delivery of any medicine, formula, diapers, milk, food or any other essentials that a mother has run out of; be it the middle of the night or middle of the afternoon. There were many nights that I ran out of these items and many more. Instead of having the option to wake up to a significant other lying next to me; I began to endure the trek into the  middle of the night- with my baby in tow. Alot of these times, it was freezing cold or over 100 degrees. My car that was repossessed by the ex husband had left me with borrowing a van from a friend. While incredibly grateful to have a moving vehicle; over the year the car began to break down.  At this time, that van had no heater or air conditioner. Braving Dallas traffic with an infant in the middle of the afternoon in middle of summer by myself, with no air conditioner, posed life threatening health concerns and resulted in a very, very stressful situation for my infant/toddler daughter with no way to explain that she could possibly understand. </div>
<div>Your donations to this cause; to this need in the single mother community, will provide the ability for <b>T</b>he <b>A</b>ugust <b>P</b>roject to <b>T</b>AP into the above resources;  to <b>A</b>CCESS them day or night on a case by case basis; and to <b>P</b>ROVIDE opportunities that these families have longed for.

<br/></span>Today, at 23 years she has become a household name on the professional windsurfing circuit and has accumulated 9 back to back world titles. In the meantime she has also moved to Holland and obtained a bachelor's degree in science. Mostly known for her freestyle prowess as - she hasn't lost a single freestyle heat nor competition since 2008- she has now set her sights on competing in all disciplines -Slalom, freestyle and waves-  of the Professional Windsurfing Association's tour. This is no easy feat as most windsurfers only focus on one discipline.<br/>

Plot Summary This documentary features Sarah-Quita Offringa.A 23 year old apparently happy-go-lucky windsurfer who hails from Aruba. She started windsurfing when she was nine. 
Today, at 23 years she has become a household name on the professional windsurfing circuit and has accumulated 9 back to back world titles. In the meantime she has also moved to Holland and obtained a bachelor's degree in science. Mostly known for her freestyle prowess as - she hasn't lost a single freestyle heat nor competition since 2008- she has now set her sights on competing in all disciplines -Slalom, freestyle and waves-  of the Professional Windsurfing Association's tour. This is no easy feat as most windsurfers only focus on one discipline.

This will be a first to have a female protagonist in a windsurfing movie. Furthermore in this documentary instead of focusing on pure windsurfing action. We rather shed light on the lifestyle of a professional windsurfer. Which typically involves travelling the world, training, finding new spots and coming in contact with new cultures.In this documentary we follow Sarah-Quita on her travels in 2015. We'll follow her as she ventures out into the world exploring new destinations and meeting new people. We'll also see how she prepares for the upcoming competition season as well as how she is coming along competing in all three disciplines on tour.
Filming locations
In Australia we see her face extreme heat and see how she handles the outdoors as she drives and camps up and down the West coast with friends in search of waves.Having been brought up in the Caribbean, Sarah-Quita is used to sunshine and wearing bikini's. We challenged her by taking her to the Nordic cold of Iceland.Explore the breathtaking landscape of Iceland with her and see whether she's able to get in her wetsuit and defy the cold water.



Aruba is where Sarah-Quita grew up and developed her windsurfing skills. This island is blessed with trade winds, turquoise water and makes for a world class location to practice. 

On our trip to her home she explains why she loves the island so much and needs to go back to her family every now and then. Finally we'll follow her on her yearly tour in the Canary Islands and Turkey as she competes in freestyle, wave and slalom events.

What We Need  We've filmed the biggest part of the movie thanks to the financial support received from the Aruban Tourism Authority and Guardian Group Fatum. However we are still looking for funds to cover the last stage of our project.
The last phase of our project is filming Sarah-Quita's competitions in the Canary islands and Turkey from July through August. After this it's time to edit the movie. Our goal is to premiere the movie at the PWA world cup in Germany, Sylt on the 2nd of October 2015.
In order to get it done by then we're going to need some extra help from our editing friends. This is where  your help comes in! With your contribution we'll be able to finish this project on time. 
Your Reward
By supporting us here we offer you:
-The exclusive download of the final movie at a discounted price. -You'll be able to view the movie before it is available to the general public.-We'll have a limited edition travel story book in print available with exclusive pictures & stories of the movie which also includes  the movie on a USB key.
Check out the contribution options on the right for more information.
We've worked hard on this project and the process of it all has been an experience of a lifetime. We're really excited to share the windsurfing and travelling excitement with you. And with you're help we can make it happen very soon.

Handy has never been told on film and the mission of this project is to preserve his legacy for generations to come.  For some viewers this will be the first time they learn about the game-changing contributions that Handy made in the world of Blues music and Jazz.  His life began seven years after the Civil War and ended at the dawn of the Space Age. From a very young age Mr. Handy was a trailblazer, a pioneer whose heroic journey took him from tent shows in the Deep South to the heart of Broadway in New York City; from Clarksdale, Mississippi to a concert at Carnegie Hall.  Handy's life was full of family drama, racial tensions, hard times and redemption.  Overcoming incredible odds he became a world renown composer and opened his own music publishing company, which still stands over 100 years later. He is revered as an American Treasure and a seminal figure in the history of the Blues, but his memory is fading away with time.   I want to bring his story back to life using interviews with  musical luminaries, {Taj Mahal, Bobby Rush, Vince Giordano to name a few}, performances of his timeless songs by current artists, and his own words. Mr. Handy is affectionately known as The Father of the Blues, and his family tree spreads far and wide.  He persevered and thrived during a period in American History that was extremely difficult for African Americans to have their voices heard.  He was a man ahead of his time and he paved the way for thousands of others to succeed.   </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437019210/meuzeak27iof2ixtifez.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p><br/></p><div>
</div><p>
</p><div>
</div><p>W.C. Handy wrote <strong>St. Louis Blues</strong> in
1914 and it became a worldwide sensation.<span> 
It was the most recorded song of the first half of the 20th Century and
lives on through the music of countless performers today.  {And a hockey team named after it in St. Louis!</span>} </p><div>
</div><p>Your contributions mean everything
to the success of the film.<span>  I spent the first five
years researching Handy</span>’s
life, and finding interviewees who could give us perspective on the magnitude
of his contributions to the Blues, and early Jazz.<span>  Under the umbrella of our non-profit
fiscal sponsor, <strong>Cinema South</strong>, I have written more than ten grant proposals to
foundations both private and public, and received monies from both sectors. My family and friends have been exceedingly generous from the beginning, helping me get started on Principal Photography and supporting me in many ways over this period.  </span><span>I paid all my own travel and lodging expenses during the research and production phase so that all funds would be used for the actual filming. </span></p><div>
</div><p><span>I've spent the past two years on the road with a
camera crew chronicling Handy</span>’s journey. We’ve recorded over 30 interviews and captured even more
current artists performing his classic Blues.<span> 
{Beale Street Blues, Memphis Blues, Yellow Dog Blues, St. Louis Blues, and
 Loveless Love, etc.} </span></p><div>
</div><p>Now it’s
time to put it all together into a cinematic experience that will enlighten,
educate and most of all entertain.<span>  The
contributions to this campaign will be used for editing, and for the
purchase of archival footage and photos to support Mr. Handy</span>’s story.<span>  </span></p><div>
</div><p>I will keep updating the campaign
with progress reports, and new perks.<span>  I
personally thank everyone who wants to be a part of preserving the legacy of this American Musical Icon. 
My hope is that it will inspire kids today to pursue their dreams
against all odds. </span></p><div>

</p>
<h2>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>Our goal of $22,000 for this
campaign will be primarily used for the editing of the film.<span>  I</span>’ve
gotten estimates from several post-production houses and the costs range
between $15,000 to $18,000.<span>  This covers
the editing, color correction, sound mixing and DVD authoring.  <br/>
<br/>
The rest of the monies will be used to license archival footage and photos that are essential
to the film. These include a film of Mr. Handy</span>’s
funeral procession in New York City, clips from his appearance on the Ed
Sullivan Show, footage of Harlem and the Cotton Club during the Harlem
Renaissance and the Ethiopian Army marching to battle with Italy.<span>  {Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie used
the St. Louis Blues as the Battle Hymn for his troops during the 1936 Italian Invasion}. Licensing these film clips
is expensive as this is extremely rare footage. 
</span></p>
<p><span>We have some great items to thank you for your contribution.  An original poster for the film, designed by Patrice McPeak will be mailed to you signed by the Director {Joanne Fish}.  We have limited edition prints of a painting of Mr. Handy by Marianthe Boyagis Snyder, and original paintings by Marianthe and Outsider Artist Walter Power Pruett.  We also have CD’s from many of the fantastic Blues artists who appear in the film.  And we will offer DVD's and digital downloads of the film and other exclusive extras for private viewing.  </span></p>
<p><span>A portion of the monies raised will be donated to <strong>The Blues Foundation’s HART Fund {Handy Artists Relief Trust}</strong> an organization that is dedicated to helping Blues artists in need of medical care and/or funeral expenses.  {See the $150 Perk for more information.} </span></p>
<p><span>Please click on the <strong>GALLERY</strong> for photos and more information about our perks, and some pictures of Mr. Handy and others from the film.<br/><br/></span></p>
<h3>Stretch Goal</h3>
<p><i><em>If we can raise $40,000 we will be able to not only fully complete and promote the film, but we can produce the companion soundtrack to go with it. Anyone who donates at the $25.00+ level will automatically receive a copy of the soundtrack if we meet our stretch goal. </em></i></p>
<p><i><em>We will also be able to continue developing the educational component that will repurpose some of our material for use in schools at all levels. </em></i></p>
<p>Most of the music in ""Mr. Handy’s Blues"" is in the public domain.<span>  But certain key performances, like excerpts
from <strong>Louis Armstrong Plays W.C. Handy</strong>, and Bessie Smith</span>’s 1924 recording of <strong>St. Louis Blues</strong> will have to be legally licensed as
well.<span>  We have many live performances of
his songs, but there are some recordings that are crucial to the authentic
telling of Mr. Handy</span>’s story. </p>
<p>The film will be approximately 90
minutes in length.<span>  This is a format that
will be attractive to television broadcasters like Smithsonian Channel, PBS and
The Sundance Channel.  We also plan to
distribute the film through DVD sales and other streaming platforms.  <br/>
<br/>
</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>The film not only tells the riveting
story of W.C. Handy’s life, it also illustrates the evolution of the Blues as we
know it.<span>  Handy took an art form that was
regional, and fairly unknown and revolutionized it. He was an educated man who
was dedicated to bringing the music of his people to the world.  Through his compositions and recordings he
introduced the folk music of the Mississippi Delta to a mainstream audience,
and published sheet music arrangements that could be played in every home around
the country.  As <strong>Mick Kolassa</strong>, Blues artist
and one of our interviewees states :<em>""He took the Blues to
school.""</em>  Handy</span>’s talent, business savvy and consummate showmanship shined a
light on a crude form of music that was relegated to street corners and saloons. To
understand the music scene of the 21st Century we have to appreciate the work
of William Christopher Handy. He was
 a true American composer, and a visionary who rose above the social
limitations of his race to achieve his goals and change the world of music
forever. </p>

<p><b>About the Producer: </b></p>
<p>I'm an Emmy winning Producer who has
worked in the documentary film and television world for almost thirty
years. {History Channel, A&amp;E, Lifetime, CBS, NBC, ABC Travel, CMT, etc.} My last independent documentary ""The Sweet Lady with the
Nasty Voice"" told the story of Wanda Jackson, the Queen Of
Rockabilly.  That film won several awards at film festivals, and was
picked up for broadcast by the Smithsonian Channel for their premiere launch.
As a student of roots music and history, I was drawn to Wanda's story in the
same way I am passionate about W.C. Handy. They both forged their own
paths with dignity, talent and grace. I am excited to bring his story to the
screen and showcase the many artists who are honoring the Father of the Blues
through their modern interpretations of his music.<br/>
<br/></p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p><strong>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Cinema South</strong> is a verified 501 C-3
non-profit corporation, so all contributions are tax deductible.<span>  All of our perks, except for the dvd and
digital downloads will be fulfilled soon after the end of the campaign. </span></strong></p>
<strong>

If our stated goal is not obtained,
we will still be able to start the editing process, taking us further down the
road to completion</strong>.  Networks and distributors require a completed work
before purchase, so the more we put together, the better our chances of
attracting potential buyers in a timely fashion. <p></p>
<p>We have already been contacted by several Film Festivals around the world, including Israel and Finland. Many theaters across the country have inquired about hosting screenings so we're excited to get the film ready for those opportunities. The Blues community has been extremely supportive and we plan to present the film at some of the many Blues Festivals that are held each year. </p>
<p>I believe that the biggest risk thus
far was starting the project eight years ago. Since then we have put together a
wonderful group of creative folks who have helped to navigate the way through
to this point.<span>  So many people have
hopped on the Handy Bandwagon because they believe in the importance of Mr.
Handy</span>’s story, and the impact it can have on so many.<span>  It</span>’s
been a fantastic journey and I am sure it’s
just going to get better as we enter this final phase. <br/>
<br/>
The challenge at hand is to raise enough funds to keep the positive momentum
going to the end. {We don’t want to take another eight years to bring this film to
you!} </p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you
like what you see in this campaign please help us spread the word through your
social circles.  Sharing is the key
component in securing our success. 
Indiegogo has tools that are very easy to use, and we appreciate
everyone who takes the time to look at what we’re trying to accomplish.  <br/>
<br/>
We’d like to thank some of the people who were committed to the film from
the very beginning, and have stayed with us through thick and thin:<br/>
<br/>
Gary Ahrens, Barbara Broach, Mark and Cathy Caldwell, the Fichtl Family, Wayne Godwin, everyone at
the Handy Home and Museum in Florence, Alabama, and the Handy Home in Memphis, TN, Dr. and Mrs. Carlos Handy, the Memphis Blues
Society, John Fuller, David Leonard, Dennis
McDougall, Patrice McPeak, Mary Nicely,  Bruce Ricker, Jonathan Saad, Cinema South, Marcia
Salter and Dr. Elliott Hurwitt for sharing his knowledge and research about

</div></div>","Summary from Producer/Director Joanne FishHi, This campaign has ended, but the fundraising continues at Cinema South.  You can still make a tax-deductible contribution, and we'll still send you the 'perks'.  Just go to this link, and click on ""SUPPORT"".  Cinema South is a 501 C-3 organization based in Nashville, Tennessee.  http://cinemasouth.org/portfolio/mr-handys-blues/Thanks to everyone who has contributed so far!! ""Mr. Handy's Blues: A Musical Documentary"" is a true labor of love for me.  It's been eight years in the making, and I am committed to completing the film by the end of 2015.  The story of W.C. Handy has never been told on film and the mission of this project is to preserve his legacy for generations to come.  For some viewers this will be the first time they learn about the game-changing contributions that Handy made in the world of Blues music and Jazz.  His life began seven years after the Civil War and ended at the dawn of the Space Age. From a very young age Mr. Handy was a trailblazer, a pioneer whose heroic journey took him from tent shows in the Deep South to the heart of Broadway in New York City; from Clarksdale, Mississippi to a concert at Carnegie Hall.  Handy's life was full of family drama, racial tensions, hard times and redemption.  Overcoming incredible odds he became a world renown composer and opened his own music publishing company, which still stands over 100 years later. He is revered as an American Treasure and a seminal figure in the history of the Blues, but his memory is fading away with time.   I want to bring his story back to life using interviews with  musical luminaries, {Taj Mahal, Bobby Rush, Vince Giordano to name a few}, performances of his timeless songs by current artists, and his own words. Mr. Handy is affectionately known as The Father of the Blues, and his family tree spreads far and wide.  He persevered and thrived during a period in American History that was extremely difficult for African Americans to have their voices heard.  He was a man ahead of his time and he paved the way for thousands of others to succeed.   


W.C. Handy wrote St. Louis Blues in
1914 and it became a worldwide sensation. 
It was the most recorded song of the first half of the 20th Century and
lives on through the music of countless performers today.  {And a hockey team named after it in St. Louis!} 
Your contributions mean everything
to the success of the film.  I spent the first five
years researching Handy’s
life, and finding interviewees who could give us perspective on the magnitude
of his contributions to the Blues, and early Jazz.  Under the umbrella of our non-profit
fiscal sponsor, Cinema South, I have written more than ten grant proposals to
foundations both private and public, and received monies from both sectors. My family and friends have been exceedingly generous from the beginning, helping me get started on Principal Photography and supporting me in many ways over this period.  I paid all my own travel and lodging expenses during the research and production phase so that all funds would be used for the actual filming. 
I've spent the past two years on the road with a
camera crew chronicling Handy’s journey. We’ve recorded over 30 interviews and captured even more
current artists performing his classic Blues. 
{Beale Street Blues, Memphis Blues, Yellow Dog Blues, St. Louis Blues, and
 Loveless Love, etc.} 
Now it’s
time to put it all together into a cinematic experience that will enlighten,
educate and most of all entertain.  The
contributions to this campaign will be used for editing, and for the
purchase of archival footage and photos to support Mr. Handy’s story.  
I will keep updating the campaign
with progress reports, and new perks.  I
personally thank everyone who wants to be a part of preserving the legacy of this American Musical Icon. 
My hope is that it will inspire kids today to pursue their dreams
against all odds. 
Please click here for a very short video with me
at the Handy Home and Museum in Florence, AL. 


What
We Need & What You Get
Our goal of $22,000 for this
campaign will be primarily used for the editing of the film.  I’ve
gotten estimates from several post-production houses and the costs range
between $15,000 to $18,000.  This covers
the editing, color correction, sound mixing and DVD authoring.  

The rest of the monies will be used to license archival footage and photos that are essential
to the film. These include a film of Mr. Handy’s
funeral procession in New York City, clips from his appearance on the Ed
Sullivan Show, footage of Harlem and the Cotton Club during the Harlem
Renaissance and the Ethiopian Army marching to battle with Italy.  {Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie used
the St. Louis Blues as the Battle Hymn for his troops during the 1936 Italian Invasion}. Licensing these film clips
is expensive as this is extremely rare footage. 

We have some great items to thank you for your contribution.  An original poster for the film, designed by Patrice McPeak will be mailed to you signed by the Director {Joanne Fish}.  We have limited edition prints of a painting of Mr. Handy by Marianthe Boyagis Snyder, and original paintings by Marianthe and Outsider Artist Walter Power Pruett.  We also have CD’s from many of the fantastic Blues artists who appear in the film.  And we will offer DVD's and digital downloads of the film and other exclusive extras for private viewing.  
A portion of the monies raised will be donated to The Blues Foundation’s HART Fund {Handy Artists Relief Trust} an organization that is dedicated to helping Blues artists in need of medical care and/or funeral expenses.  {See the $150 Perk for more information.} 
Please click on the GALLERY for photos and more information about our perks, and some pictures of Mr. Handy and others from the film.
Stretch Goal
If we can raise $40,000 we will be able to not only fully complete and promote the film, but we can produce the companion soundtrack to go with it. Anyone who donates at the $25.00+ level will automatically receive a copy of the soundtrack if we meet our stretch goal. 
We will also be able to continue developing the educational component that will repurpose some of our material for use in schools at all levels. 
Most of the music in ""Mr. Handy’s Blues"" is in the public domain.  But certain key performances, like excerpts
from Louis Armstrong Plays W.C. Handy, and Bessie Smith’s 1924 recording of St. Louis Blues will have to be legally licensed as
well.  We have many live performances of
his songs, but there are some recordings that are crucial to the authentic
telling of Mr. Handy’s story. 
The film will be approximately 90
minutes in length.  This is a format that
will be attractive to television broadcasters like Smithsonian Channel, PBS and
The Sundance Channel.  We also plan to
distribute the film through DVD sales and other streaming platforms.  


 
The
Impact
The film not only tells the riveting
story of W.C. Handy’s life, it also illustrates the evolution of the Blues as we
know it.  Handy took an art form that was
regional, and fairly unknown and revolutionized it. He was an educated man who
was dedicated to bringing the music of his people to the world.  Through his compositions and recordings he
introduced the folk music of the Mississippi Delta to a mainstream audience,
and published sheet music arrangements that could be played in every home around
the country.  As Mick Kolassa, Blues artist
and one of our interviewees states :""He took the Blues to
school.""  Handy’s talent, business savvy and consummate showmanship shined a
light on a crude form of music that was relegated to street corners and saloons. To
understand the music scene of the 21st Century we have to appreciate the work
of William Christopher Handy. He was
 a true American composer, and a visionary who rose above the social
limitations of his race to achieve his goals and change the world of music
forever. 


About the Producer: 
I'm an Emmy winning Producer who has
worked in the documentary film and television world for almost thirty
years. {History Channel, A&E, Lifetime, CBS, NBC, ABC Travel, CMT, etc.} My last independent documentary ""The Sweet Lady with the
Nasty Voice"" told the story of Wanda Jackson, the Queen Of
Rockabilly.  That film won several awards at film festivals, and was
picked up for broadcast by the Smithsonian Channel for their premiere launch.
As a student of roots music and history, I was drawn to Wanda's story in the
same way I am passionate about W.C. Handy. They both forged their own
paths with dignity, talent and grace. I am excited to bring his story to the
screen and showcase the many artists who are honoring the Father of the Blues
through their modern interpretations of his music.

Risks
& Challenges


Cinema South is a verified 501 C-3
non-profit corporation, so all contributions are tax deductible.  All of our perks, except for the dvd and
digital downloads will be fulfilled soon after the end of the campaign. 


If our stated goal is not obtained,
we will still be able to start the editing process, taking us further down the
road to completion.  Networks and distributors require a completed work
before purchase, so the more we put together, the better our chances of
attracting potential buyers in a timely fashion. 
We have already been contacted by several Film Festivals around the world, including Israel and Finland. Many theaters across the country have inquired about hosting screenings so we're excited to get the film ready for those opportunities. The Blues community has been extremely supportive and we plan to present the film at some of the many Blues Festivals that are held each year. 
I believe that the biggest risk thus
far was starting the project eight years ago. Since then we have put together a
wonderful group of creative folks who have helped to navigate the way through
to this point.  So many people have
hopped on the Handy Bandwagon because they believe in the importance of Mr.
Handy’s story, and the impact it can have on so many.  It’s
been a fantastic journey and I am sure it’s
just going to get better as we enter this final phase. 

The challenge at hand is to raise enough funds to keep the positive momentum
going to the end. {We don’t want to take another eight years to bring this film to
you!} 
Other
Ways You Can Help
If you
like what you see in this campaign please help us spread the word through your
social circles.  Sharing is the key
component in securing our success. 
Indiegogo has tools that are very easy to use, and we appreciate
everyone who takes the time to look at what we’re trying to accomplish.  

We’d like to thank some of the people who were committed to the film from
the very beginning, and have stayed with us through thick and thin:

Gary Ahrens, Barbara Broach, Mark and Cathy Caldwell, the Fichtl Family, Wayne Godwin, everyone at
the Handy Home and Museum in Florence, Alabama, and the Handy Home in Memphis, TN, Dr. and Mrs. Carlos Handy, the Memphis Blues
Society, John Fuller, David Leonard, Dennis
McDougall, Patrice McPeak, Mary Nicely,  Bruce Ricker, Jonathan Saad, Cinema South, Marcia
Salter and Dr. Elliott Hurwitt for sharing his knowledge and research about
Handy’s life with us.  And last but not
least, our mascot and chief safety officer, Jackson! {pictured below}",4.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><b>The Game Plan</b></p>
<p>Imagine living without hearing. You'd miss the sounds of the world - music, laughter, traffic noises as you try to cross the road, a friend shouting out in the street behind you, the roar of a crowd at a hockey game. Even the whistle of the referee or call of your teammates as you tried to play. Would you even try to play?</p>
<p>But what if there was a way you could despite this? What if deaf hockey was a thing?... Oh wait, it is. And it's got an exciting story we want to share with the world.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.OntarioDeafHockey.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ontario Deaf Hockey Association</a> was founded in 2011 to bring deaf and hearing individuals and athletes together and provide pathways in sport and hockey for deaf athletes in the province.  As our  athletes prepare for the Deaflympics (yeah, that's also a thing), we're putting together a documentary about deaf hockey to help build awareness of the sport and garner support for the love of the game.</p>
<p>And also just because it a fascinating topic, right?</p>
<p>As part of the documentary, we've partnered with many different organizations including the Hockey Hall of Fame, Glide,Karbon Sports, CrossIceHockey, Epic Toronto and Kobe Sportswear.</p>
<p>It's going to be an intriguing and arousing short documentary with game footage along with some fan interviews. But before we can put it all together, we need your help <b><i>Raising CA$3,000 to cover things like equipment, location and interpreter costs. The remaining amount will be put back into the Ontario Deaf Hockey Association to ensure that the program's success to help athletes accomplish their dreams of playing hockey and representing their province and later, Team Canada at the Deaflympics.</i></b></p>
<p>So if you love hockey, are curious about a different version of the game or just want to be involved in an exciting documentary that will score goals at film festivals, here's your chance to get involved. We've got some great perks for all your generous support and because we're still in production there's even opportunity to be interviewed on screen!</p>
<p><b>What Winning Looks Like (what we need &amp; what you get)</b></p>
<p>We're not asking for a lot, but every little bit you can contribute will make a significant difference. Your generosity will not only bring this documentary to life, but also give a voice to the voiceless and enable deaf kids and adults around Canada to dare to dream.</p>
<p><b><i>We're aiming to raise CA$3,000 for the short documentary and additional funds for the Ontario Deaf Hockey Association and the athletes involved.</i></b></p>
<p>As a thank you for your support, we've got some fantastic perks including social media shout outs, a download of the documentary and even an opportunity to be interviewed on the documentary during a game or have an acknowledgement in the credits.</p>
<p>So get involved today and give a voice to deaf hockey players across Ontario and Canada.</p>
<p><b>The SIGN-ificance of the Impact</b></p>
<p>Everyone of us is born with a dream of greatness. For many, that dream is in sport - a universal language which brings diverse groups of people together. But sadly, access to sport isn't always as easy as it should be.</p>
<p>According to the Canadian Association of the Deaf there are currently 350,000 culturally deaf Canadians and 3.15 million Canadians who identify as hard of hearing. Like with the hearing population, many love their hockey!</p>
<p>Deaf hockey breaks down the barriers for these fans and athletes and the <a href=""http://www.deaflympics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Deaflympics</a> provides a world class stage for our top athletes to represent their country.  It's an exciting sport with only a few small changes to the way it's played alongside everything you love our about our nation's game.</p>
<p>The documentary will raise awareness of this version of the game and help our stars as they work hard to represent themselves and their country. It will also show those who have a disability and those hockey-loving kids that they're not alone.

<p><b>The Opposition (risks &amp; challenges)</b></p>

I aspire to impact American culture through filmmaking, especially  at  a time like this in our history, at a moment when our country is at a cross roads once again. There is a problem with wealth distribution in the United States that is causing our middle class to disappear, making college more and more difficult to afford in the process. This has caused a decrease in our standard of living and has dramatically compromised American prosperity and the American Dream.</li> <li>""Sketch"" is a call to action - a revolution of cultural Ideals. It is a satire drama about an average college student named Dusty Kid, who is told by his father he can't follow his dreams in becoming a filmmaker. Rebelling against his father's economic power over his education, Dusty meets a group of outcast artists who seek to revolutionize their culture. However, in a rigged economy, they will be forced to use unorthodox methods to accomplish their dreams. We will educate and empower both younger and older generations about the destructive effects of college loan debt and tuition hikes and how they have been affecting our lives. In order to reach the largest audience, ""Sketch"" will be a web-series, created for and accessible to all those who are ready for the economic and educational revolution.</li>
</ul>
<div><h3>The Budget</h3></div>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>As a young filmmaker, I know the tremendous difficulties that arise in creating a film. Without money and only a camera and dedicated casts, I have overcome these challenges and learned how to make a film without a budget. Although I have already acquired the equipment, actors, editing software, computers and lights needed to create ""Sketch,"" we still need your help. In order to make this a reality, we need $3,500.  This budget will cover locations, transportation, costume, emergency costs and catering for cast and crew. Without funds to cover these expenses, it is not only difficult but impossible to finish a project longer than 15 minutes.<br/>
</li>
<li>One thousand dollars will go to costumes, makeup and catering. Another thousand dollars will cover locations such as a cafe, lecture halls and classrooms, ect. The rest will go to transportation, greenscreens and any emergency equipment. </li>
<li>If Our Goal is not met all the funds go to producing the perks and the production of the Project. </li>

I aspire to impact American culture through filmmaking, especially  at  a time like this in our history, at a moment when our country is at a cross roads once again. There is a problem with wealth distribution in the United States that is causing our middle class to disappear, making college more and more difficult to afford in the process. This has caused a decrease in our standard of living and has dramatically compromised American prosperity and the American Dream. ""Sketch"" is a call to action - a revolution of cultural Ideals. It is a satire drama about an average college student named Dusty Kid, who is told by his father he can't follow his dreams in becoming a filmmaker. Rebelling against his father's economic power over his education, Dusty meets a group of outcast artists who seek to revolutionize their culture. However, in a rigged economy, they will be forced to use unorthodox methods to accomplish their dreams. We will educate and empower both younger and older generations about the destructive effects of college loan debt and tuition hikes and how they have been affecting our lives. In order to reach the largest audience, ""Sketch"" will be a web-series, created for and accessible to all those who are ready for the economic and educational revolution.

The Budget


As a young filmmaker, I know the tremendous difficulties that arise in creating a film. Without money and only a camera and dedicated casts, I have overcome these challenges and learned how to make a film without a budget. Although I have already acquired the equipment, actors, editing software, computers and lights needed to create ""Sketch,"" we still need your help. In order to make this a reality, we need $3,500.  This budget will cover locations, transportation, costume, emergency costs and catering for cast and crew. Without funds to cover these expenses, it is not only difficult but impossible to finish a project longer than 15 minutes.

One thousand dollars will go to costumes, makeup and catering. Another thousand dollars will cover locations such as a cafe, lecture halls and classrooms, ect. The rest will go to transportation, greenscreens and any emergency equipment. 
If Our Goal is not met all the funds go to producing the perks and the production of the Project.

That was when I opened up to her and tried to get her to see my transition through my eyes. That’s what the title refers to; walking side by side in the same direction, towards the same goal - I shared my decision with her so that she’d go on this journey with me. </p><p>I dreamed big that day, but then again, it’s what I’ve always done. As a kid growing up in a small provincial village in Romania, I wouldn’t be where I am now if I hadn't chased my dreams. And the wilder they were, the more I held on to them. I am now living in the capital city, with 10 years’ worth of experience in the film industry under my belt. During that time, I’ve been a director, a script consultant, a story editor and a personal assistant to English directors working on Romanian projects. I’ve produced / directed / wrote over 100 hours of TV, all aired. </p><p>I’m also the executive director of the first Romanian association that fights exclusively for the rights of trans people, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Asociatia.TRANSform/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TRANSform</a>. Just a few months after we founded TRANSform, we had already formed a community of over 100 trans Romanians, living both here and abroad. </p><p>We did it all on next to nothing, powered by the love and support of those who understand or live the fight of being a trans person in a transphobic country. In May 2014, I was given a full scholarship to attend the 5th Transgender European Council in Budapest, Hungary, with over 200 other participants coming from 50 countries. Then, in June 2014, I had the honor of producing and holding an<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMz5sUQmfyQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> interview</a> with writer and lecturer <b><a href=""http://andrewsolomon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Solomon</a></b>, winner of the National Book Award, LGBT activist and a powerful voice in support of the arts.</p><p>Among my biggest achievements to date, organizing the first feminist and queer international film festival in Romania was a feat that the TRANSform team and I managed to make happen in November 2015. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FAQiff.ro/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FAQiff</a> was a labor of love, for which I was honored to put together the short film selection, out of over 1000 submissions.The first edition of FAQiff was held in one of Bucharest’s biggest arthouse cinemas, to a full house every night.</p><h3><b>Why Abreast Matters to the Trans Community </b></h3><p>That <i>Abreast</i> sees the light of day is important not just to me as its creator but to the community as a whole. Most of us have lived through some version of this moment I’m describing in my short, and we know first-hand how loved ones reacting badly when we’re at our most vulnerable can hurt us, derail our dreams, even crush us beyond repair.</p><p>The trans community in Romania finds itself on the wrong end of so much misconception and narrow-mindedness every single day - which is why this film has to happen. It has to happen in full view, to spark a conversation that is long overdue in this country, and it has to ultimately foster acceptance and respect. </p><p>So it’s paramount that <i>Abreast</i> be made with your help, through IndieGoGo, in order to gain the support of the worldwide community, a cachet of approval that will go a long way toward shifting public opinion on trans matters in Romania. </p><p>Aside from gaining these credit points at home through the support of the international community, the campaign will also help us financially. The money raised will put <i>Abreast</i> through post-production as well as go towards paying festival submission fees. I will not stop until I’ve put <i>Abreast</i> in the hands of every selector of every major film festival out there.</p><h3><b>This Is Bigger Than Me: You Are Effecting Real Change</b></h3><p>This film is not just about my story. As one of the few visible activists in my country, I have learned that, in an overly regulated and closed society such as ours, it is important that the stories of the ones who cannot yet speak up be made known to the world. These stories alone can help build a community that will eventually prevail. What I mean by that is I hope this film will give people courage to take the first step, as hard as I know that is. That’s why, with <i>Abreast</i>, I’m trying to reach as many people as possible, both those in need of acceptance from their families, and also those struggling to come to terms with a loved one going through a transition to become their true selves.</p><h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3><p>We want to create a community around <i>Abreast</i>, and that’s where you come in - not just as financial contributors to our cause, but also by helping us get the word out and create some buzz around the film and its purpose.</p><p>The bulk of the 7,000 dollars we’re asking for - as much as 90% of it - will go into post-producing<i> Abreast</i>, and I’ll be putting whatever money remains into festival submissions fees and attendant costs. Even if the campaign ends up raising a fraction of our goal, it will all still go toward making <i>Abreast </i>happen - it’s a story so personal and yet so resoundingly ours, the community’s as a whole, that I’ll sell everything I’ve got before I let it die.</p><p>Moving on to a lighter subject, I really hope you’ll like the perks we’ve prepared for you, our IGG family: pins, personal live streaming sessions from the set, posters, DVDs with the final-cut of the film, making of and bloopers, portraits made by the same artist who signs the <i>Abreast</i> poster and in the same style, and even credits as associate producer.  </p><h3><b>The Impact </b></h3><p>If you are a trans person, or you have trans friends or simply a humane interest in our struggle, you know how hard it is. Contributing to this will make you an ally to one of the most unfairly and illegally treated minorities in Romania. If you ever visit Romania, you will find a family here, a network of support made up of open-hearted people you will have in your corner no matter what!</p><p>I have been in the film industry for over a decade. I have been thinking about and shaping this project for a while now, getting the best possible professionals on board. And so I can say without any false modesty, as an artist, director and production manager, that I know this project will meet the highest quality standards. I already have the support of senior film professionals such as <b><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0605164/?ref_=nmmd_md_nm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maia Morgenstern</a></b>, best known internationally for her role in <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>, as well as other highly regarded Romanian film pros. I also know that this film will be a turning point in the life of my community and it will not pass unnoticed in international film festivals.</p><p>My film will be ready in 2 months, if we come up with the minimum amount of 7,000 dollars, and, with the help of my network of filmmakers and promoters, I will disseminate it across all possible channels. Your name will be in the credits, and so a LOT of people will find out about your invaluable help in making <i>Abreast </i>happen!</p><h3><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h3><p>Right now the primary obstacle in making Abreast a reality is represented by production costs. Once these are taken care of I am confident that I will be able to promote my work via a great diversity of channels, including submitting it to festivals such as Cannes, Berlin and others.</p><p>I am currently pursuing other possible avenues, like trying to get sponsorships from local businesses. Having said that and considering the transphobic climate in Romania, it’s really this IndieGoGo campaign and you guys that I genuinely think will help overcome the challenge of meeting production costs.</p><h3><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></h3><p>Please use all social sharing tools at your disposal to promote my project to other trans people and/or friends and supporters of the trans people’s fight for recognition! It is essential that as many people as possible learn about my initiative to make Romanian trans people’s voice heard. This is the first project of its kind, and we need all the support we can get from outside our country, so that, little by little, we can make Romanian society acknowledge the harm it’s inflicting on us by letting hate and misinformation run rampant.</p><br/></div>","A Word about My BackgroundHi!

I will not stop until I’ve put Abreast in the hands of every selector of every major film festival out there.This Is Bigger Than Me: You Are Effecting Real ChangeThis film is not just about my story. As one of the few visible activists in my country, I have learned that, in an overly regulated and closed society such as ours, it is important that the stories of the ones who cannot yet speak up be made known to the world. These stories alone can help build a community that will eventually prevail. What I mean by that is I hope this film will give people courage to take the first step, as hard as I know that is. That’s why, with Abreast, I’m trying to reach as many people as possible, both those in need of acceptance from their families, and also those struggling to come to terms with a loved one going through a transition to become their true selves.What We Need & What You GetWe want to create a community around Abreast, and that’s where you come in - not just as financial contributors to our cause, but also by helping us get the word out and create some buzz around the film and its purpose.The bulk of the 7,000 dollars we’re asking for - as much as 90% of it - will go into post-producing Abreast, and I’ll be putting whatever money remains into festival submissions fees and attendant costs. Even if the campaign ends up raising a fraction of our goal, it will all still go toward making Abreast happen - it’s a story so personal and yet so resoundingly ours, the community’s as a whole, that I’ll sell everything I’ve got before I let it die.Moving on to a lighter subject, I really hope you’ll like the perks we’ve prepared for you, our IGG family: pins, personal live streaming sessions from the set, posters, DVDs with the final-cut of the film, making of and bloopers, portraits made by the same artist who signs the Abreast poster and in the same style, and even credits as associate producer.  The Impact If you are a trans person, or you have trans friends or simply a humane interest in our struggle, you know how hard it is. Contributing to this will make you an ally to one of the most unfairly and illegally treated minorities in Romania. If you ever visit Romania, you will find a family here, a network of support made up of open-hearted people you will have in your corner no matter what!I have been in the film industry for over a decade. I have been thinking about and shaping this project for a while now, getting the best possible professionals on board. And so I can say without any false modesty, as an artist, director and production manager, that I know this project will meet the highest quality standards. I already have the support of senior film professionals such as Maia Morgenstern, best known internationally for her role in The Passion of the Christ, as well as other highly regarded Romanian film pros. I also know that this film will be a turning point in the life of my community and it will not pass unnoticed in international film festivals.My film will be ready in 2 months, if we come up with the minimum amount of 7,000 dollars, and, with the help of my network of filmmakers and promoters, I will disseminate it across all possible channels. Your name will be in the credits, and so a LOT of people will find out about your invaluable help in making Abreast happen!Risks & ChallengesRight now the primary obstacle in making Abreast a reality is represented by production costs. Once these are taken care of I am confident that I will be able to promote my work via a great diversity of channels, including submitting it to festivals such as Cannes, Berlin and others.I am currently pursuing other possible avenues, like trying to get sponsorships from local businesses. Having said that and considering the transphobic climate in Romania, it’s really this IndieGoGo campaign and you guys that I genuinely think will help overcome the challenge of meeting production costs.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease use all social sharing tools at your disposal to promote my project to other trans people and/or friends and supporters of the trans people’s fight for recognition! It is essential that as many people as possible learn about my initiative to make Romanian trans people’s voice heard. This is the first project of its kind, and we need all the support we can get from outside our country, so that, little by little, we can make Romanian society acknowledge the harm it’s inflicting on us by letting hate and misinformation run rampant.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p align=""center"">a Yugoslav Love Story</p>
<p>She was seventeen and he twenty years old, when they met at a poetry read in a city in Macedonia, then part of country known as the jewel of the Balkans.</p>
<p>He was more of a poet than she was, always brooding and sad even when he was happy. She was a bubbly tomboy who liked his attention and was tickled by the nickname he gave her, Paola.  Salvatore Adamo’s <i>Paola Dulce Paola</i> played on every radio station in Europe and the thought that he could compare her to the real princess amused her. He claimed his Paola was just as pretty and as personable as the real Paola Margherita Giuseppina Maria Antonia Consiglia.</p>
<p>They had three days together and he left the Festival convinced that he he had found his half.  She was molded by the sun, he said, and she was the one.  They promised to write until they meet again at another poetry read, in August.  </p>
<p>For the next 3 months they wrote and made plans, and he would revisit those letters and the events of that distant 1969 now and then, as if to punish himself. </p>
<p>In the city of Struga where every August poets gather to read their dreams, he searches for Paola but cannot find her.  Heartbroken, he is reluctant to leave but under pressure from his fellow travel companions, he abides.  Paola arrives two hours later.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next 49 years he would create his own myth and wallow in the guilt of not having waited for her.   Trapped into two marriages, both empty of any emotional connections, he would carry Paola’s absence in his heart and through the haunting imagery of his poetic verses.  The handsome youth turns into a dark and a somber man who lives with Paola’s absence and a cry that emanates from his heart…. Why are you not here?</p>
<p>Young hearts wound easily and Paola would take his absence as a clear sign that he did not care. She locks away the memory of the promise he held and moves on.  Shortly after Struga 69 she leaves her native land, curious to understand the word.  Off first to Paris, she would eventually settle in New York City. She doesn’t just walk through live, she dives.</p>
<p>In 1984, she would arrive at the Sarajevo Airport, to work on covering the Winter Olympics the same day he would fly to yet another festival in Struga, the town in which they missed one another.</p>

<p>They would miss one another at the Nikola Tesla airport, when she leaves for the United States and he flies back to his hometown in Montenegro.</p>
<p>In the early 90s, Paola watches from afar as her native land dives into the abyss of hatred, but she fears for no one, he is absent from the hallways of her memories.</p>
<p>In the midst of the horror he writes his last poem:  My Father’s rifle.</p>
<p>He would be reminded of her every time the name Paola  comes up-- when the real princess’s husband, the Belgian King to be visits Yugoslavia for talks with Marshal Tito, when the Princess, now Sua Altessa Royale, vacations on the Adriatic Coast, when the scandal of her husband illegitimate daughter is strewn over the European yellow press, when Salvatore Adamo explains on an Italian talk show what inspired him to write <i>Paola Dulce Paola. </i></p>
<p>An old man at 70, much too old for his age, he has turned to God for answers, and every Sunday he asks the same question - Why did I leave?  Why didn’t I wait?  Is it because I did not have faith in my own capacity to love?  I did know she was the one, yet I bend under pressure to marry and raise a daughter that was not mine.

I look pretty good for my age, I know. I was sent to this year by some voodoo magic put on me in a lousy deli while I was workin' on a case. With your help, I can find Julie West's prized possession, solve the case, and make it home all before my brother gets back from his sabbatical. I need to solve this. If I don't- I don't know if I'll ever make it home. 
All the answers lie with the Totem and the elusive Ms. West. 

Case Specifics
 Here's a little more detail for ya baby-faces out there:
  Crackpot team

I'm still adjusting to this new life so I had to hire a few yuppies to help out. But they ain't cheap.

Food
To keep the new kids quiet I gotta feed them everyday we're working and boy oh boy can they eat. Especially one- you know who you are. But I'm happy to do it. A little food ain't nothing if it means I can get home. 

Equipment
I gotta say- this modern technology is tempting me to stay. All I needed before was some dust, a brush, keen eyes, and a sharp wit. Now I gotta get myself a computer, some fancy cameras, and a whole lot more dodads. My team knows how to work them all though so I just gotta make sure we have enough batteries for it all. 

Travel
Do I need to explain any further than gas? How do people nowadays go anywhere?

Bribes
This is my favorite part of the PI game. Seeing who will crack for a little bit of money. Flash a little green and see who opens the doors to let you in. The team has found some confidants but only if the price is right. Don't let the leads go cold, people, don't do it. These young ones worked hard for it.

Misc
You never know who you're gonna have to bail out from the slammer. I've spent a few nights there myself. Being a Private Eye isn't always easy or glamorous. Sometimes you're sleeping next to a guy who had a little bit too much at the bars. 
If we don't hit the whole amount needed we'll still keep plowing ahead in this case. Justice will prevail or my name isn't Max Martin.

    Earning Your Stripes There are a lot of ways to be a part of this case. Just look at the ways you can move up the ranks in the force! But if you for some reason aren't able to put some gas in our tank then feel free to let your friends know about our mission. Share my case with the world! Who knows?

will be a critical research of the living conditions of people in this region.
It will reveal the real truth about Kosovo, one that is unknown and repressed
by corruption, crime and ethnic hatred. Many relevant layers of the history
will be presented and main contemporary issues dealt with in overt and
unembellished manner: in the first place the question of whether there is any
possible way out of poverty, ethnically motivated murders and accompanying
destruction. By delving into these issues, this documentary will also uncover
the role of international factors in general, in the war zones such as Kosovo. It will examine to what extent the international
missions such as EULEX and UNMIK, as well as NATO troops within KFOR (Kosovo
Force), manage to provide decent life and sufficient livelihood for all ethnic
groups living in Kosovo. Did they succeed to eradicate or at least reduce
ethnic cleansing, corruption and crime during their presence, or their
involvement in Kosovo crisis had some other effects? Finally, we would like to
emphasize that this film will be based only on our research on the field,
dealing with reliable/credible sources and verifiable facts, without any biases
favoring ethnic hatred or interests of different controversial (xenophobic,
chauvinistic) groups. The movie will be subtitled in English in order to be
available to the world wide audience.<br/><br/><p>By
the means of this documentary we will be able to investigate and present the reality of everyday life in Kosovo to the
international audience from the anti-imperialistic social perspective. The
daily torments and misery of a great number of people, who seems to be
neglected not just by the international public and media, but also by the
diplomacy and politicians, will reach the light of the day. We will use many
channels to spread this ugly truth as wide as possible, in the hope that
institutions and organizations in charge of monitoring and rectifying this kind
of situations – massive-scale violations of human rights – will reexamine their
role in the escalation of internal conflicts and deterioration of inter-ethnic
relations in Kosovo, and thus allow for more appropriate solution to be reached.
At this point, we are not in the position to indicate what this solution should
be, but we are confident that it cannot be found without taking into account
the voice and the will of the people – of all ethnic origins – whose experience
and opinions are one of the main subjects of our movie. To this end, our
documentary will be aired on TV networks, international documentary festivals
and, finally, made available to watch in the internet. Our systematic
presentation of the real state of affairs in Kosovo, and refutation of current
blatant propaganda, should convince the officials from both local and global
camps that they cannot continue to turn the blind eye to this blind spot of
South-East Europe, ignoring the fate of the hundreds of thousands, treated as
for them the most basic human laws and regulations do not apply.</p>
<p><span>The money raised from contributors should help us to cover all necessary costs of travel, food, accommodation and equipment during the shooting of the documentary, as well as to allow us to buy copyrights of the video material from the archives we need.</span> According to our estimations, the final
amount needed for successful completion of our project will be around 7.400$. These resources will also be used to hire
professional cameraman and editor, pay unexpected contingencies and, if necessary, to procure the
services of local officials. All payments
will be duly recorded, with tickets, receipts or signed descriptive notes, and
records will be properly kept for auditing.</p>
<p>Our project’s primary value is in giving voice to the
oppressed social groups, denied of democratic representatives, or represented
in such a way which could not possibly protect or advance their basic rights
and interests. We also hope to raise general awareness about criminal
injustice, ongoing segregation, political and police oppression, economic
difficulties and double standards taking place on the part of European soil
itself. According to our sources, media fabricated stories about Kosovo have
been used to cover up a much more important question – relating not just to
Kosovo, but to all countries and provinces forced to meet a similar fate, be
they in Europe, or Africa, or Middle East etc. – and that is what is the real
purpose and tangible achievement of international missions? Are they capable to
protect all ethnic groups from the violent attacks, post-war retaliations and
ethnically motivated executions, and to establish legal and administrative
system free of corruption, as they do not hesitate to guarantee? At the moment,
we cannot deal with this problem in other countries. But, with regard to
Kosovo, our film will break through the facade of media whitewashing and empty
political slang concealing the simple and dreadful facts, investigate how
things are really going on under the bell jar, show the real people’s suffering
and destitution, deliver their own words, thoughts, fears and desires and
spread their yet unheard message to the world.</p>

</div>","Documentary about socio-political situation in Kosovo by Serbian journalist Milenko SreckovicDocumentary about Kosovo
will be a critical research of the living conditions of people in this region.
It will reveal the real truth about Kosovo, one that is unknown and repressed
by corruption, crime and ethnic hatred. Many relevant layers of the history
will be presented and main contemporary issues dealt with in overt and
unembellished manner: in the first place the question of whether there is any
possible way out of poverty, ethnically motivated murders and accompanying
destruction. By delving into these issues, this documentary will also uncover
the role of international factors in general, in the war zones such as Kosovo. It will examine to what extent the international
missions such as EULEX and UNMIK, as well as NATO troops within KFOR (Kosovo
Force), manage to provide decent life and sufficient livelihood for all ethnic
groups living in Kosovo. Did they succeed to eradicate or at least reduce
ethnic cleansing, corruption and crime during their presence, or their
involvement in Kosovo crisis had some other effects? Finally, we would like to
emphasize that this film will be based only on our research on the field,
dealing with reliable/credible sources and verifiable facts, without any biases
favoring ethnic hatred or interests of different controversial (xenophobic,
chauvinistic) groups. The movie will be subtitled in English in order to be
available to the world wide audience.By
the means of this documentary we will be able to investigate and present the reality of everyday life in Kosovo to the
international audience from the anti-imperialistic social perspective. The
daily torments and misery of a great number of people, who seems to be
neglected not just by the international public and media, but also by the
diplomacy and politicians, will reach the light of the day. We will use many
channels to spread this ugly truth as wide as possible, in the hope that
institutions and organizations in charge of monitoring and rectifying this kind
of situations – massive-scale violations of human rights – will reexamine their
role in the escalation of internal conflicts and deterioration of inter-ethnic
relations in Kosovo, and thus allow for more appropriate solution to be reached.
At this point, we are not in the position to indicate what this solution should
be, but we are confident that it cannot be found without taking into account
the voice and the will of the people – of all ethnic origins – whose experience
and opinions are one of the main subjects of our movie. To this end, our
documentary will be aired on TV networks, international documentary festivals
and, finally, made available to watch in the internet. Our systematic
presentation of the real state of affairs in Kosovo, and refutation of current
blatant propaganda, should convince the officials from both local and global
camps that they cannot continue to turn the blind eye to this blind spot of
South-East Europe, ignoring the fate of the hundreds of thousands, treated as
for them the most basic human laws and regulations do not apply.
The money raised from contributors should help us to cover all necessary costs of travel, food, accommodation and equipment during the shooting of the documentary, as well as to allow us to buy copyrights of the video material from the archives we need. According to our estimations, the final
amount needed for successful completion of our project will be around 7.400$. These resources will also be used to hire
professional cameraman and editor, pay unexpected contingencies and, if necessary, to procure the
services of local officials. All payments
will be duly recorded, with tickets, receipts or signed descriptive notes, and
records will be properly kept for auditing.
Our project’s primary value is in giving voice to the
oppressed social groups, denied of democratic representatives, or represented
in such a way which could not possibly protect or advance their basic rights
and interests. We also hope to raise general awareness about criminal
injustice, ongoing segregation, political and police oppression, economic
difficulties and double standards taking place on the part of European soil
itself. According to our sources, media fabricated stories about Kosovo have
been used to cover up a much more important question – relating not just to
Kosovo, but to all countries and provinces forced to meet a similar fate, be
they in Europe, or Africa, or Middle East etc. – and that is what is the real
purpose and tangible achievement of international missions? Are they capable to
protect all ethnic groups from the violent attacks, post-war retaliations and
ethnically motivated executions, and to establish legal and administrative
system free of corruption, as they do not hesitate to guarantee? At the moment,
we cannot deal with this problem in other countries. But, with regard to
Kosovo, our film will break through the facade of media whitewashing and empty
political slang concealing the simple and dreadful facts, investigate how
things are really going on under the bell jar, show the real people’s suffering
and destitution, deliver their own words, thoughts, fears and desires and
spread their yet unheard message to the world.

We are well underway with our SAG-AFTRA New Media Web Series entitled ""Memoirs of a Godfather"". Please watch the video to learn more about the project and also to catch some sneak peeks from our episode one. Memoirs of a Godfather is a dark comedy which starts off during 1932 (The Great depression era). The story is an all original,  registered and copyrighted film project. It centers around a Godfather and his small time gang of organized crime and the antics and comical interactions between the town folk and the local criminal element. The story is not fashioned after the typical Chicago or big city crime boss style, rather when I (Stephen Dean-Producer/Director/Writer) created this story the Godfather's ""operations"" ideally take place in a much smaller town in the more rural areas of the southeast outside of Atlanta. Instead of fixating on the stereotypically violent aspects of organized crime, this series is focused more upon the inadequacies of the Godfather and his henchmen. The series contains varying levels of comedy such as slap stick, farcical/screwball, sophomoric, and situational humor. It is light hearted fun and entertainment with limited violence or gore but an unlimited amount of silly, goofy.... fun! </p><p>My production outfit (Dean Film Works) is based out of northeast Georgia. Our film project is based out of Flowery Branch and Winder, Georgia (approximately 30 minutes northeast of Atlanta) and we film at multiple location outside of the city. </p><p>We could really use your help to keep the production running in not only a functional, but also enjoyably smooth manner! We just completed production for episode one on December 27th, 2015. We are approximately 85% through post production (film/video editing, etc.) for episode one now. We will be beginning production on episode two as soon as we receive funding. Episode one was sadly an unfunded project through kickstarter and only $7 from Indiegogo so with that said the production company (me) personally financed all related production cost which was relatively lofty. Our food bill alone for cast and crew for day one (snacks and food) was approximately $400. With so many people being involved with this project and more actors being introduced as the series progresses, your support and contributions are more important than ever. These contributions are needed for the most basic things such as food, MUAH (makeup and hair supplies/cost), props, wardrobe, travel stipends for actors traveling from afar. We truly appreciate your time and your consideration to support our project. We are all team players and we would love to have you be a part of our team.

<b>Film Synopsis</b><br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It starts with an extensively drug resistant strain of TB in Western Australia, and total extinction of all human, animal, plant, and bacterial life on the planet. Only the birds remain. The birds, and a few bedraggled and starving survivors. Some are the lucky ones who survived their infection. Others are the resourceful ones who managed to avoid the airborne Red11 infection altogether.</p>
<p>Aoife and Niamh are two of the latter, sisters who live on in post-apocalyptic Ireland, having avoided the disease altogether through reclusiveness, caution, and luck. They spend their days trawling the Irish countryside for anything that will help keep them alive, staying one foot ahead of starvation and infection, not daring to approach the lawless anarchy of the big towns and cities that are left. At night they retreat to their base, a small house deep in the wilderness, where they read, play board games, and remember the past.</p>
<p>Their routine is turned upside down when they encounter an intruder, a desperate loner trying to outrun a group he calls ‘The Lost Boys’. Knowing the danger he poses them as the only other person who knows the location of their house, the girls cannot let him go. They consider what they should do with him in grim conversation, and end up holding him as a prisoner.  He speaks of a rumored town out west near Galway, the town of New Hope, where people have come together and civilisation has started again. When The Lost Boys catch up with them the girls are forced to flee their last refuge and take off on a desperate and deadly journey across the barren country in the pursuit of New Hope...</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><i><b>""A young scheming pastor who believes that the ends justifies the means
and an aging cowboy who won't be backed down square off against each other as
the cowboy refuses to sell his desert ranch at a loss to the pastor's church;
however when tragedy strikes it’s up to his trophy wife from another country
and his violent daughter to keep the land.""</b></i></p>
<p>I love writing and putting together a film. So far I've had success with a short film called <a href=""http://offworldnetwork.thirdscribe.com/2015/03/04/on-the-border-produced-and-written-by-forbes-west/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""On The Border""</a> which you can watch by clicking the link. It's been in over 13 different film festivals across the world.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
</div><div> <p>We need about <b>24k</b> to get the project off of the ground.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With <b>24-25k</b>, we can film the first part of the script at the very least (to start a <b>television series</b>, which has been proposed, or a <b>limited web-series </b>at the least). In other words, we could film the first 31 minutes and have a full story within those 31 minutes. With <b>45k</b>, we should be able to film the entire <b>90 minute film</b>, and if we managed to hit <b>100k</b>, we should have a very decent product to disclose with nothing to be cut down.</p>
<p>Again, we should emphasize that this is a small production with everyone having worked together before. Everyone is invested, everyone knows what to do. Money is the only true obstacle, which is some ways is a blessing. From the cinematographer to every actor, we've bonded outside the film world and know we can pull this off.</p>
<p>We should be able to conclude post-production by December 2016.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>If we can do this, we can really have an interesting and well done film that talks about the dark side of America right now. The film discusses terrorism, greed, religious corruption and mental illness- topics that are at the forefront of what's happening right now in the USA. This isn't a film with heavy social commentary though- it's a film meant as entertainment without any heavy handed ""message"".  It's a film that is supposed to be entertaining but at the same time full of deeper themes.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>The real obstacle we have to overcome is our budget. Locations have been scouted, 3 out of 4 of the main characters have been cast, the crew has been set. To be perfectly honest, all of us know each other and are friends and family who have worked together on other projects before so there should be little difficulty in getting along. The entire script is setup to be shot in chiefly two locations, neither which are dependent on the weather and neither of which has any problems with getting a film permit. To be very honest, there could be an issue with locking in one of these two settings (if for some unforeseen reason something else is scheduled to be filmed). But that seems very unlikely from what we can ascertain. </div><div>Again, we should emphasize that this is a small production with everyone having worked together before.

and an aging cowboy who won't be backed down square off against each other as
the cowboy refuses to sell his desert ranch at a loss to the pastor's church;
however when tragedy strikes it’s up to his trophy wife from another country
and his violent daughter to keep the land.""
I love writing and putting together a film. So far I've had success with a short film called ""On The Border"" which you can watch by clicking the link. It's been in over 13 different film festivals across the world.
What We Need & What You Get
 We need about 24k to get the project off of the ground.

With 24-25k, we can film the first part of the script at the very least (to start a television series, which has been proposed, or a limited web-series at the least). In other words, we could film the first 31 minutes and have a full story within those 31 minutes. With 45k, we should be able to film the entire 90 minute film, and if we managed to hit 100k, we should have a very decent product to disclose with nothing to be cut down.
Again, we should emphasize that this is a small production with everyone having worked together before. Everyone is invested, everyone knows what to do. Money is the only true obstacle, which is some ways is a blessing. From the cinematographer to every actor, we've bonded outside the film world and know we can pull this off.
We should be able to conclude post-production by December 2016.
The Impact
 If we can do this, we can really have an interesting and well done film that talks about the dark side of America right now. The film discusses terrorism, greed, religious corruption and mental illness- topics that are at the forefront of what's happening right now in the USA. This isn't a film with heavy social commentary though- it's a film meant as entertainment without any heavy handed ""message"".  It's a film that is supposed to be entertaining but at the same time full of deeper themes.
    Risks & Challenges  The real obstacle we have to overcome is our budget. Locations have been scouted, 3 out of 4 of the main characters have been cast, the crew has been set. To be perfectly honest, all of us know each other and are friends and family who have worked together on other projects before so there should be little difficulty in getting along. The entire script is setup to be shot in chiefly two locations, neither which are dependent on the weather and neither of which has any problems with getting a film permit. To be very honest, there could be an issue with locking in one of these two settings (if for some unforeseen reason something else is scheduled to be filmed). But that seems very unlikely from what we can ascertain. Again, we should emphasize that this is a small production with everyone having worked together before. Everyone is invested, everyone knows what to do. Money is the only true obstacle, which is some ways is a blessing. From the cinematographer to every actor, we've bonded outside the film world and know we can pull this off.

It could be problematic to assert a trans identity onto Alessandra because they do not identify as transgender within the narrative. Alessandra’s gender fluidity and gender-nonconformity is similar to some forms of transgender subjectivity and children must be given space and freedom to explore their gender or genders in order to self-identify.</p><p>This isn’t to say that all gender-fluid children eventually identify with a trans identity, but we hope that Limina will encourage parents and families NOT to police children’s genders.</p><p><b>WHY MAKE A MOVIE THAT FEATURES A GENDER-FLUID CHILD AS THE PROTAGONIST? </b></p><p>""Call Me Tree"" is a recent children’s book that doesn’t contain any gender specific pronouns. Maya Christina Gonzalez (the author), states that “gender conformity is one of the leading causes of bullying and can have long lasting, even tragic consequences.” Gonzalez wrote the book because by “beginning early and sharing age appropriate books that help kids see through gender assumptions, gender creative kids can relax and trust that they are perfectly natural and valuable. And kids who are cisgender (where sex and gender align according to normative expectations) can know that they are part of a larger picture of natural diversity. This sets the stage for more learning about diversity and inclusion as they develop and helps dismantle gender based bullying before it begins.”</p><p>So, similar to Gonzalez, the goal for <i>Limina</i> is to make a cultural intervention by adding a positive cinematic example to the emerging discussion about gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kids and parenting. Both gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kids and cisgender kids will watch this film and learn about tolerance and acceptance. It will also help gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kids to feel appreciated and less alone!</p><p><b>IS THIS TOPIC REALLY THAT IMPORTANT? WHY HAVEN’T I HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE NOW?</b></p><p>Recent examples of gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming in popular culture:</p><p>""Chasing Rainbows: Exploring Gender Fluid Parenting"" is an anthology of edited papers by scholars and parents of gender-nonconforming/gender-creative/gender-fluid kids inspired by:</p><p>A high-profile example of gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kids is the family in Toronto sparked a media frenzy after being featured in a May 2011 article in the Toronto Star because they decided to raise their children genderless. The Toronto Star story became the most read online article in its history (80k hits on the first day of publication). Kathy Witterick and David Stocker enabled their children, Storm, to be gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming rather than attempting to police their genders. The Toronto couple wants their children to share their genders when the time is right. </p><p>David Burtka and Neil Patrick Harris recently wrote a foreword to a book about the importance of gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming parenting entitled <i>Raising My Rainbow</i> by Lori Duron. </p><p>The Telegraph in the UK recently wrote an article by Radhika Sanghani about Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s child, Shiloh that eventually made headlines around the world. Shiloh prefers to be called ‘John’ and is an example of the type of gender-fluidity that occurs during childhood that may or may not develop into a trans identity.</p><p>An article in the New York Times in 2012 by Ruth Padawer explored the “trend” of gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kids and parenting (note: this article is problematic due to a lack of comprehensive research, but it still raised significant discussion about this topic).</p><p><b>OK, BUT WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN? WHAT IS GENDER, THEN?</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1377137/files/20150412130926-Binary.jpg?1428869366"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Gender is not a binary (oppositional poles of identification as the only option). </p><p>Gender is more of a spectrum and children often realize this organically at a young age. </p><p>An article written by Carrie Kilman entitled “The Gender Spectrum” in the <i>Teaching Tolerance</i> encapsulates this best in relation to the topic of gender-fluid/gender-noncomforming/gender-creative kids.</p><p>Kilman notes the two <b>myths</b> about gender:</p><p><b>1) Gender is binary, offering only two options</b></p><p><b>2) Gender and sex are conflated and the same thing</b></p><p>So, the majority of people believe that “every person is either male or female, and the distinction is based on that person’s anatomy.” However, gender is more of a spectrum rather than the narrow notion of man/male/masculine and woman/female/feminine.</p><p><b>BUT, WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT? HOW WILL LIMINA MAKE A DIFFERENCE BY FEATURING A GENDER-FLUID CHILD CHARACTER?</b></p><p>Kilman discusses a gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kid in their article named Alex who is a fourth-grader in Madison, Wisconsin. “Alex feels most comfortable chucking pronouns altogether. Alex’s preferred gender descriptor is gender fluid.” </p><p>The author notes important statistics related to the experiences that gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming face: “a plethora of binary gender expectations in school,” which results in serious and sometimes violent ramifications. Compared to cisgender children (where their sex and gender line up according to societal normativity), gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kids face: increased rates of bullying, assault depression, school drop-out, drug abuse, self-harm, and suicide (see image below).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1376941/files/20150412115457-Stats.jpg?1428864897"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Contribute to this film and help us share this important cultural intervention.</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1375352/files/20150411170155-TARainbow.jpg?1428796915"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The primary target audience for <i>Limina</i> will be children, young adults and adults interested in and entertained by the wisdom and maturity found, sometimes surprisingly, in young children. </p><p>There are two specific niche markets that <i>Limina</i> will fall into:</p><p><b>CHILDREN’S FILMS </b></p><p>Children’s films are often animated and forego live-action. <i>Limina</i> will be a high-quality HD live-action film that connects with the niche market of children’s films, family films and youth films.

Join us on this exciting journey!*The main character of Limina, Alessandra, will be referred to using the gender-neutral pronouns: they/them/their throughout this description.A magical gender-fluid child named Alessandra who, led by innocence and intuition, is so curious about the lives of the inhabitants of a small picturesque town that they decide to play an active part in an unknown woman’s mourning process.Limina (plural form of ‘Limen’ – Latin for ‘threshold’) is a dramatic fiction short film that represents the colorful and magical portrayal of a gender-fluid child (around 8 years old) at the center of a story that inspires compassion, kindness and the understanding that children, too, have voices that deserve to be heard.BACKGROUND:In North America and other areas of the world, transgender has become an umbrella term for a diverse array of trans identities that relate to one’s gender identity and gender expression. It could be problematic to assert a trans identity onto Alessandra because they do not identify as transgender within the narrative. Alessandra’s gender fluidity and gender-nonconformity is similar to some forms of transgender subjectivity and children must be given space and freedom to explore their gender or genders in order to self-identify.This isn’t to say that all gender-fluid children eventually identify with a trans identity, but we hope that Limina will encourage parents and families NOT to police children’s genders.WHY MAKE A MOVIE THAT FEATURES A GENDER-FLUID CHILD AS THE PROTAGONIST? ""Call Me Tree"" is a recent children’s book that doesn’t contain any gender specific pronouns. Maya Christina Gonzalez (the author), states that “gender conformity is one of the leading causes of bullying and can have long lasting, even tragic consequences.” Gonzalez wrote the book because by “beginning early and sharing age appropriate books that help kids see through gender assumptions, gender creative kids can relax and trust that they are perfectly natural and valuable. And kids who are cisgender (where sex and gender align according to normative expectations) can know that they are part of a larger picture of natural diversity. This sets the stage for more learning about diversity and inclusion as they develop and helps dismantle gender based bullying before it begins.”So, similar to Gonzalez, the goal for Limina is to make a cultural intervention by adding a positive cinematic example to the emerging discussion about gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kids and parenting. Both gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kids and cisgender kids will watch this film and learn about tolerance and acceptance. It will also help gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kids to feel appreciated and less alone!IS THIS TOPIC REALLY THAT IMPORTANT? WHY HAVEN’T I HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE NOW?Recent examples of gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming in popular culture:""Chasing Rainbows: Exploring Gender Fluid Parenting"" is an anthology of edited papers by scholars and parents of gender-nonconforming/gender-creative/gender-fluid kids inspired by:A high-profile example of gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kids is the family in Toronto sparked a media frenzy after being featured in a May 2011 article in the Toronto Star because they decided to raise their children genderless. The Toronto Star story became the most read online article in its history (80k hits on the first day of publication). Kathy Witterick and David Stocker enabled their children, Storm, to be gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming rather than attempting to police their genders. The Toronto couple wants their children to share their genders when the time is right. David Burtka and Neil Patrick Harris recently wrote a foreword to a book about the importance of gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming parenting entitled Raising My Rainbow by Lori Duron. The Telegraph in the UK recently wrote an article by Radhika Sanghani about Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s child, Shiloh that eventually made headlines around the world. Shiloh prefers to be called ‘John’ and is an example of the type of gender-fluidity that occurs during childhood that may or may not develop into a trans identity.An article in the New York Times in 2012 by Ruth Padawer explored the “trend” of gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kids and parenting (note: this article is problematic due to a lack of comprehensive research, but it still raised significant discussion about this topic).OK, BUT WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN? WHAT IS GENDER, THEN?Gender is not a binary (oppositional poles of identification as the only option). Gender is more of a spectrum and children often realize this organically at a young age. An article written by Carrie Kilman entitled “The Gender Spectrum” in the Teaching Tolerance encapsulates this best in relation to the topic of gender-fluid/gender-noncomforming/gender-creative kids.Kilman notes the two myths about gender:1) Gender is binary, offering only two options2) Gender and sex are conflated and the same thingSo, the majority of people believe that “every person is either male or female, and the distinction is based on that person’s anatomy.” However, gender is more of a spectrum rather than the narrow notion of man/male/masculine and woman/female/feminine.BUT, WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT? HOW WILL LIMINA MAKE A DIFFERENCE BY FEATURING A GENDER-FLUID CHILD CHARACTER?Kilman discusses a gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kid in their article named Alex who is a fourth-grader in Madison, Wisconsin. “Alex feels most comfortable chucking pronouns altogether. Alex’s preferred gender descriptor is gender fluid.” The author notes important statistics related to the experiences that gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming face: “a plethora of binary gender expectations in school,” which results in serious and sometimes violent ramifications. Compared to cisgender children (where their sex and gender line up according to societal normativity), gender-fluid/gender-creative/gender-nonconforming kids face: increased rates of bullying, assault depression, school drop-out, drug abuse, self-harm, and suicide (see image below).Contribute to this film and help us share this important cultural intervention.The primary target audience for Limina will be children, young adults and adults interested in and entertained by the wisdom and maturity found, sometimes surprisingly, in young children. There are two specific niche markets that Limina will fall into:CHILDREN’S FILMS Children’s films are often animated and forego live-action. Limina will be a high-quality HD live-action film that connects with the niche market of children’s films, family films and youth films. Children’s and family film festivals are increasing and educational distributors are seeking high-quality content for children and young adults. Independent filmmakers rarely work in this genre, so there is a market in need for good content. LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans*) FILMSLGBT audiences will also find interest in Limina because the main character is gender-fluid. Gender-fluid kids are rarely represented in cinema, so this will connect with a niche market in gay, lesbian and trans film festivals.Your donations will help us cover these general pre-production, production and post-production costs:Pre-Production (Preparation)
production insurance (location, cast, crew and equipment)

Production (Shooting of the Film)

<div>The majority of our budget will head to the production of this film. In order to be able to pull off this project, we need to rent a camera with the ability to capture the scenes as fantastically as they should be. We also need radios in order to save time by easily communicating between each other no matter where we are, a truck to protect and transport our equipment, location fees, and additional camera supplies so that we can enhance and capture the images that we originally pictured.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h4></h4>
<h4>-FOOD</h4>
<p>What's important for a happy and efficient production? Good food! I have never worked on a set where the crew was happier and more efficient than when they were fed something other than pizza. By feeding our crew well, we will keep the morale high and the workflow fast.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>-PROPS AND MAKEUP</h4>
<div>Props and makeup bring films to life since they are what distinguishes a decorative ring from a ring of power, or a teenager from a werewolf. While the use of props and makeup will be on the lower end in <i>Status Quo</i>, we will still need a fair number of props to pull off the scenes that we have planned.</div>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>-POST-PRODUCTION</h4>
The rest of the money will be used for arguably the most vital of reasons: the storage, backup, and editing of the film. Post-production is where films finally come together so we need to make sure that we save what we have and that we are able to shape it into the masterpiece that we foresee!</div>

</div></div>","Our Story: 
Adam, a freshman, joins a fraternity in order to fit in at college. After completing most of his pledge process, he is kidnapped and forced to complete one final task in order to join the fraternity. In the process of completing this task, his brother gets injured and is still forced to complete the task, putting his life in danger. Seeing this, Adam stands up to the Pledge master in the name of brotherhood, discovering what true brotherhood is.





Our Goal:
To show the audience the manner in which hazing is viewed by both pledges and actives in order to cast light on a subject that few can relate to, but that many experience or witness from afar. We want to show that it is possible to attain brotherhood without the use of hazing and that true brotherhood does not come from hazing.

<p><span></span></p>
</div><p><span>In a city often overwhelmed with commercialism, trendiness and youth, once a month you can step into the past at The Noble Maritime Collection at Snug Harbor in Staten Island and experience a slice of authentic New York City history. A multi-generational group of musicians has been throwing “hootenannies” there, singing traditional sea shanties and maritime folk music that tell epic and personal stories of the sailors so integral to the creation of this hi-tech city. This passionate group of big-hearted sailing enthusiasts are preserving a rich history that can’t be found in any textbook, so we’re making them the subject of a short documentary to help spread the word.</span></p><p>What captivated us about the William Main Doerflinger Memorial Sea Shanty Sessions group is the genuine joy they bring to the songs they sing. Comprised of folk musicians and retired sailors ranging in age from 22 to 82, the group generously share their vibrant energy with audiences, encouraging active engagement through the shanties’ call and response format. In these informal but lively “community sings” co-sponsored by The Folk Music Society of New York, Inc., one can witness the power of art and community to bring historical stories alive and rejuvenate all who participate.</p><p>After playing together in various settings for twenty years, the group currently meets at The Noble Maritime Collection housed in a historic building at Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden, a Staten Island institution which formerly housed ""aged, decrepit and worn-out"" seamen. Now beautifully restored, the building is considered the “crown jewel of Staten Island” and is a most fitting venue for carrying on these important traditions.</p><p>Harmonies, guitars, banjos, and concertinas breathe life into dusty tunes, just as the group’s energy blows wind into the sails of this almost forgotten New York City history.</p>On September 20th, 2015, the group is celebrating their 20th Anniversary, and we want to be there to film it. <br/><br/><div><div>
<b>Your contributions will help us hire the additional crew necessary to capture the event on film, and will ultimately allow us to spread the word about the beautifully supportive group who are keeping this rare history and music alive.

With foreign investors gobbling up real estate for sterile condos and austere high rises, national chain stores obliterating authentic mom-and-pop local businesses, and skyrocketing rents pushing out artists and long-time locals, there is a real danger of New York City completely losing touch with its unique identity. This group of Sea Shanty singers is a rare and beautiful gem of authenticity, artfully and honestly keeping alive this important oral tradition so integral to the very creation of New York City.
Our hope is that by capturing the personal story of the singing group, we can help magnify the group’s efforts to share this slice of authentic New York with the people who love and live in this great city.
Incidentally, the project will also shine a positive light on the creative ventures happening on Staten Island and within New York City’s older adult population, both of which are often stereotypically maligned. We believe that recognizing and honoring our elders brings strength and love to their final years, and concurrently infuses our communities with the benefits of their wisdom and experience.   Risks & Challenges 
At this point, our biggest challenge is getting a proper crew together that can align with the schedule of our story subjects and the 20th Anniversary Event on September 20th, 2015. Without these contributions, we will not be able to hire additional crew members (sound recordist, a second camera operator, editor) and therefore the quality and likelihood of a finished product would decline tremendously.

<span><br/></span>Amber is a short film by performer, writer and director Andi Osho, which focuses on one twisted night where obsessed teenager, Amber Gorman terrorises Charlie Love, <b><div style=""display: inline !important;"">heartthrob and member of boyband <i>One Summer</i>. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Inspired by a documentary about One Direction fans, <i>Amber</i> is a smart, tense thriller which explores obsession, teen desire and celebrity culture.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">From<i> Fatal Attraction</i> to <i>Play Misty For Me</i>, movie fans have always enjoyed the thrill ride of the obsessed character.

AMBER - THE SHORT FILM


Amber is a short film by performer, writer and director Andi Osho, which focuses on one twisted night where obsessed teenager, Amber Gorman terrorises Charlie Love, heartthrob and member of boyband One Summer. 


A devastated Amber breaks into his home after learning he is to leave the band, imploring him to change his mind. At first he dismisses her but when she reveals their shared history, events take a dark turn.

Inspired by a documentary about One Direction fans, Amber is a smart, tense thriller which explores obsession, teen desire and celebrity culture. In Charlie Love, we have a jaded, cynical and exhausted pop star pursued by Amber, a devoted but ultimately disturbed teenager who struggles to stay grounded in reality. 



From Fatal Attraction to Play Misty For Me, movie fans have always enjoyed the thrill ride of the obsessed character. Here Amber offers an exciting twist on the genre, telling the story from her point of view and delving deeper into her psyche.
 ""You cannot intellectualize yourself out of obsession. You cannot cure yourself of it"". Nicolas Roeg

From a germ of an idea, Amber has begun to take shape. The  script is written, our team is coming together and most excitingly, we've found two amazing actors to play Amber and Charlie.  

We're really excited about sharing this story which is not just about infatuation but also a commentary on celebrity culture and how this form of obsession is all but encouraged by record companies. 
Successfully funding this project will help bring this fun, thrilling and dark film into being. 



Andi Osho (Writer/ Director) is an award-winning performer, writer and film maker who has featured on several UK and US comedy shows (Mock The Week, Live At The Apollo, The Late, Late Show) and guest-starred in dramas (Eastenders, Waking The Dead, Finding Carter) as well as features, Swinging With The Finkels (opposite Martin Freeman) and Lights Out (opposite Teresa Palmer). 

Andi has written for FOX and the BBC and her first film, Brit.i.am, which she wrote and produced, was selected for eleven international film festivals, winning awards at three. Her directorial debut, The Grid premiered at the Wasteland International Film Festival in 2015.




Zoe Waller (Producer) Zoë Waller is a London-based producer with a ten year television and commercial production career which has seen her work with broadcasters such as Channel 4, The Food Network and The Extreme Channel and corporate entities such as British Airways, Estée Lauder and Marks & Spencer. She has experience across several media forms including short film, long-form documentaries, digital content and TVCs.   

Adam Recht (Editor/ Executive Producer) has been editing for film and television since 1989. Starting out in documentaries, for over a decade, Adam has specialised in high-end drama and independent film and has built up a diverse portfolio from Ballet Shoes starring Emma Watson to the BAFTA and Academy Award nominated My Week With Marilyn starring Michelle Williams for which Adam received an ACE Eddie award nomination.
Other TV work includes the acclaimed BBC drama A Short Stay in Switzerland starring Julie Walters, Twenty Thousand Streets Under The Sky, action thriller Fallen, romantic drama NY-LON and Channel 4 cop showThe Ghost Squad.
Justin Evans (Cinematographer) has over 15 years of experience across documentary, factual entertainment, music videos as well as short and long form narrative programming, with his work broadcast on all major UK TV channels. His comedy work includes The Inbetweeners and The Mighty Boosh and Ricky Gervais's Fame DVD and music video clients Moby and Badly Drawn Boy. And of course our fabulous lead cast, Cat Van Dort and Will Finlason.


Cat Van Dort took a starring role in 'Right To Choose' a Government campaign about forced marriage; she played an endearing A.I. in 'Mistaken', voted top ten in a national competition judged by Benedict Cumberbatch and Guillermo del Toro; and in 'Peaches and Cream', which won best short film at the Dakshina film festival.As well as being an accomplished actor, Cat has also presented training videos for ""The Body Shop"" and Oxford University Press's first ever interactive English Language tool ""Mosaic"".Will Finlason 
Will trained at the Manchester School of Theatre and played Prior Walter in Tony Kushner's much acclaimed ‘Angels in America’ and the title role in Stephen Sondheim's ‘Sweeney Todd’ in his final year. 
Will made his professional debut as ‘This Boy’ in West End hit 'Epstein', starring opposite Andrew Lancel (The Bill, Coronation Street) and made his TV debut in award-winning BBC series, Casualty.

Now the business part. The budget for the entire project is £20,000. It's a lot of cash but about right for a short film of this scale. We've raised some from personal finances but the rest, we're looking to generate through crowdfunding. 
So far we've had some very generous in-kind gifts, such as use of camera kit and access to a professional editing system - as well as, of course, the geniuses who operate them. 
Having said that however, we do want to ensure that people are paid. It may not be to full industry standards, but at least it's a token to acknowledge the expertise, time and energy they're putting into this project. 
So where specifically does the money go - 
Our biggest expenses, after cast and crew fees are:
Location fees - most of the film takes place in one location but it needs to be a house believable as the home of a pop star. 
Stunt co-ordinator - We have a cool fight sequence and need a professional stun co-ordinator so it looks great but no one actually gets hurt!
Make up/ props/ wardrobe - We want our film to look authentic and these departments make that happen. For example, during the fight sequence Amber scratches, punches and bites. All of that requires a top quality make up artist to create these effects. 
Clearance fees - The opening sequence of the film includes archive news footage which, even for a little non-profit short like ours, has to be paid for. PIE CHART

 



We've got some GREAT perks as you can see from the list - mugs with Amber's face at the bottom, script downloads, thank you videos, dinner with the cast, even a walk-on role. We want you to feel like you're part of our team, because you are. This won't happen without you. So it's our way of saying, thank you.

Sometimes people want to support the project but can't give money, we get it. So, here's some other ways you can help. 

We need leads on a house that looks like the home of a pop star. We also need a space that could be in a police station. And, of course, sharing this campaign on social media is invaluable!Send us a video of you talking about your teen crush!*

Thank you so much for reading all the way down to here! Seeing as you've got this far, how's about going one last step and contributing? 

We, the film makers are, forever indebted to you. If you do make a contribution to the film, we really hope you enjoy your perks, but also that, when you get to see the finished product, you'll see, it was all worth it in the end.

</div></div>","Hi! Our names are Amy and Angie and we are Producers, Writers and 
Directors from Gold Coast Australia. We are joining together for the 
first time, to make an incredibly inspiring Australian horror/thriller 
short film.
The Red 
Ochre Man tells the story of a group of friends who set out on a road 
trip to unravel the urban legend of a man who is believed to be 
possessed by demons. A number of unexplained disappearances are 
occurring around the Nation and they are determined to find out if The 
Red Ochre Man is to blame.We

 are asking for $3500. This is our entire production budget in hope of 
raising as much as we can through crowd funding. Let's be 
frank... we will be personally financing the majority, but we could 
really
 use some help getting there, which is where you come in! When you contribute to the 
making of The RED Ochre Man, you help make a dream happen, and in 5 years 
when we're in Hollywood, you can totally tell everyone you helped get us there!All
 funds raised from this campaign will go directly into the movie, no 
matter how much we raise, so if you see that we've reached our goal and 
you still want to contribute, please do. Every dollar counts!








We have established a very talented and prestigious cast who have all 
had many years experience in acting in film and theatre. We are proud to
 be working with such an incredibly gifted group of actors.

 with our incredibly talented cast we welcome our supporting cast who

<p>Horror and sci-fi movies have a special place in the history of American cinema. They each play a substantial and therapeutic role in the collective expression of the  American psyche.  Ever since the Cold War of the 1950’s the sci-fi and horror genres in film have expressed the bucolic American social landscape pitted against our deepest and darkest existential fears by questioning the viability of American society and what it means to accept the anesthetizing effect of the American Dream as the best possible outcome for our lives.</p>
<p>Living life in a relatively safe society but knowing that at any time one of many dangers might threaten our well being may leave us feeling we have no control in protecting ourselves against potential threats: hunger, sickness, war, political catastrophe, poverty, epidemics, crime, alien invasion, serial killers or the upheaval of natural disasters.  This psychologically stressful mental state requires an occasional release preferably a method that can be implemented in a safe and controlled environment: in a movie theater of one’s living room.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of a horror film when viewed in comparison to our own real life drama provides us with an experience that is deeply impactful. Through the horror film experience we clarify our many fears in a rational manner. Some psychological and emotional solutions are best left to cinematic fantasy.  The result is something directly parallel to a resurgence of hope!  The cinematic experience provides a temporary ability to move forward in our routine lives regardless of the frightful magnitude of our imagined or possibly real fears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The horror of vampires living as a subspecies among us, although fantastical by today's modern understanding of our existence, is not as far-fetched and out of the realm of possibility as you might think. It is quite easy to sense some truth to the possibility of their existence. Much anecdotal evidence exists to indicate parallel yet divergent evolutionary development. </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FkrUyE2DvL1U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DkrUyE2DvL1U&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FkrUyE2DvL1U%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p> <ul> <li>There is an undercurrent of discontent among the majority of society who feel that the elite of our population are only in it for themselves, democratically out of control. Our film resonates with this current mood of societal oppression. Characters in our film provide a metaphor for those groups in our society that are overlooked and disenfranchised. </li> <li>Keith Payson has produced 12 feature films and negotiated multi-film contracts for independent film producers, we want this to happen for Ascent of Evil. For this project to be a success we need your help, we need the strength of a fan base, those who appreciate horror film and want to see the genre progress.</li> <li>We currently have letters of intent from investors committed to providing 50% of the film production funds required (12.5 million dollars).  Our total film production budget for the filming of Ascent of Evil is $25 million dollars. A condition to receiving the 12.5 million already committed is that we find additional investors to put in the first of the production funds already required. With your support and donations we will create a polished business plan, which is the proper and professional way to make a presentation to potential investors. And with your support we are all but guaranteed to lift ourselves to the next phase of operation. The amount we have requested will provide the tools required to approach major studios, directors, bankers, venture capitalists, and of course major star-talent!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The risks and challenges are minor at this stage, other than our time and your donations.  Keith has produced numerous films in his career and has stellar reputation for being able to manage the fiscal integrity of our film project. He, and our other team members can clearly and succinctly communicate our vision to anyone who is a lover of science fiction and horror. And now we introduce a brand new paradigm to the vampire film genre. We reveal a thrilling new biological reality of these once - mythical predators! </p>

<p>The challenge we have accepted is the telling of an iconic and fascinating story but in a brand new and mesmerising way.<br/></p>
<p>Clearly there are risks in any investment, but we have carefully evaluated a multitude of financial factors related to this project's return on investment. We have chosen to move forward slowly, carefully, and prudently to arrive at reasonable and rational investment strategies. The challenge of our next phase of production is to use the tools that your donations are providing us to present the viability of this business venture and this collective artistic expression as one that investors will prosper from. In order to do that we must gain the confidence of our investors by convincing them that we will complete the project on or under budget and within the scheduled timeframe, in other words we must convince you that this creative team has the ability to meet and possibly even exceed these responsibilities.</p>

   What We Need & What You Get 
All of the members of our creative team have put a lot of sweat equity into the project. (i.e., Lots of work; No pay).  We have come as far as we can without some modest funding. Reasonable compensation is required for the tools described above, primarily budgets, schedule, business plan and a retainer for a quality entertainment attorney. In addition, if procedes allow we will develop a more complete set of storyboards and include them in the business plan. And we may also include photographs with a variety of filming locations.
The budget for the Ascent of Evil film project is $25 million. The funds needed to meet development costs, by comparison, are minimal: $25,000. 
These funds will allow us to put forward a professional business plan which is guaranteed to draw the necessary interest and respect from potential investors required to achieve a fully funded status. 
Very Unusual and Fun Perks!

We have some unique perks for you, which include; Prints of our original storyboard artwork, a limited number of autographed copies of the first edition award winning trade paperback, autographed copies of the script, ebook copies of the trilogy novels,  signed museum quality prints of the movie poster. You won't go away empty handed, regardless of your donation, you will have something in hand that we believe you'll value as a project supporter. Even if we don't reach our goal, any funds obtained will get us closer toward the presentation of our business plan to prospective investors.
As special bonus perks we have nicely bound scripts, and for those who are interested and able a private consultation regarding your script with either Michael or Keith, which will include the creation of a budget and a schedule for your movie. We also have unusual but very fun donation level perk that will appeal to your deepest part of your movie fan personality. We will include your likeness in a storyboard. You will be cast as one of the characters in Ascent of Evil. Juliana our Medical illustrator will create original artwork worthy of framing as a panel of storyboards depicting a scene from Ascent of Evil with one of the characters in your likeness. If you want us to, we will even depict your wife and kids!
 
   The Impact 
Horror and sci-fi movies have a special place in the history of American cinema. They each play a substantial and therapeutic role in the collective expression of the  American psyche.  Ever since the Cold War of the 1950’s the sci-fi and horror genres in film have expressed the bucolic American social landscape pitted against our deepest and darkest existential fears by questioning the viability of American society and what it means to accept the anesthetizing effect of the American Dream as the best possible outcome for our lives.
Living life in a relatively safe society but knowing that at any time one of many dangers might threaten our well being may leave us feeling we have no control in protecting ourselves against potential threats: hunger, sickness, war, political catastrophe, poverty, epidemics, crime, alien invasion, serial killers or the upheaval of natural disasters.  This psychologically stressful mental state requires an occasional release preferably a method that can be implemented in a safe and controlled environment: in a movie theater of one’s living room.
The juxtaposition of a horror film when viewed in comparison to our own real life drama provides us with an experience that is deeply impactful. Through the horror film experience we clarify our many fears in a rational manner. Some psychological and emotional solutions are best left to cinematic fantasy.  The result is something directly parallel to a resurgence of hope!  The cinematic experience provides a temporary ability to move forward in our routine lives regardless of the frightful magnitude of our imagined or possibly real fears.

The horror of vampires living as a subspecies among us, although fantastical by today's modern understanding of our existence, is not as far-fetched and out of the realm of possibility as you might think. It is quite easy to sense some truth to the possibility of their existence. Much anecdotal evidence exists to indicate parallel yet divergent evolutionary development. 
  There is an undercurrent of discontent among the majority of society who feel that the elite of our population are only in it for themselves, democratically out of control. Our film resonates with this current mood of societal oppression. Characters in our film provide a metaphor for those groups in our society that are overlooked and disenfranchised.  Keith Payson has produced 12 feature films and negotiated multi-film contracts for independent film producers, we want this to happen for Ascent of Evil. For this project to be a success we need your help, we need the strength of a fan base, those who appreciate horror film and want to see the genre progress. We currently have letters of intent from investors committed to providing 50% of the film production funds required (12.5 million dollars).  Our total film production budget for the filming of Ascent of Evil is $25 million dollars. A condition to receiving the 12.5 million already committed is that we find additional investors to put in the first of the production funds already required. With your support and donations we will create a polished business plan, which is the proper and professional way to make a presentation to potential investors. And with your support we are all but guaranteed to lift ourselves to the next phase of operation. The amount we have requested will provide the tools required to approach major studios, directors, bankers, venture capitalists, and of course major star-talent!    Risks & Challenges  The risks and challenges are minor at this stage, other than our time and your donations.  Keith has produced numerous films in his career and has stellar reputation for being able to manage the fiscal integrity of our film project. He, and our other team members can clearly and succinctly communicate our vision to anyone who is a lover of science fiction and horror. And now we introduce a brand new paradigm to the vampire film genre. We reveal a thrilling new biological reality of these once - mythical predators! 

The challenge we have accepted is the telling of an iconic and fascinating story but in a brand new and mesmerising way.
Clearly there are risks in any investment, but we have carefully evaluated a multitude of financial factors related to this project's return on investment. We have chosen to move forward slowly, carefully, and prudently to arrive at reasonable and rational investment strategies. The challenge of our next phase of production is to use the tools that your donations are providing us to present the viability of this business venture and this collective artistic expression as one that investors will prosper from. In order to do that we must gain the confidence of our investors by convincing them that we will complete the project on or under budget and within the scheduled timeframe, in other words we must convince you that this creative team has the ability to meet and possibly even exceed these responsibilities.

<p><b><i>Expecting
Sunshine the Documentary</i></b> tells the story of writer
and artist Alexis Marie Chute, as she sets out to rediscover her identity as a
mother - and as a woman - after one of the most primal types of losses; the death of her newborn at birth. The story is framed within the three trimesters of her
pregnancy that followed. Through artistic visuals, profound interviews,
“luminous prose and with such clear-eyed insight,” Chute reveals the turbulent 40-week experience of having a baby after loss. Poignant, touching, tender and inspiring, <b><i>Expecting Sunshine</i></b> “makes
death a starting point for the continuation of life.”</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446929053/snbutarckh3fot7asgix.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h2><b>Why this Project is Meaningful and Needs your Support:</b></h2>
<p>In 2010, Alexis Marie Chute’s son Zachary died at birth. He had a random genetic condition and a large tumor around his heart. Doctors predicted that Zachary would be stillborn, but he was born alive. He never made a sound or opened his eyes. Alexis Marie and her husband Aaron rocked and sang to Zachary. They only had a moment with their son before he died – and that was the moment that changed their lives forever.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446909477/bavweweq39btyxc0iuqe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When Alexis Marie got pregnant again with her next child, at first she was thrilled. Soon, though, that excitement turned to worry and a debilitating fear for her next baby's life and safety. Would this child suffer the same fate? </p>
<p>In the 40 weeks that followed, she realized she needed to address her grief for Zachary, which she had tried to bury, before the birth of the child that followed. That is when <b>Expecting Sunshine the Memoir</b> was born; it became a creative narrative of survival. <b>Expecting Sunshine the Documentary</b> is the visual and literary manifestation of that experience.</p>
<p>The topic of <b>Expecting Sunshine the Documentary</b> is often taboo and uncomfortable for people who have not experienced this type of loss – which is exactly why there is a need for this film. Many do not know what to say or how to empathize with the bereaved parents, despite wishing to help. What this means is that families can feel isolated and suffer in silence, especially when they struggle with subsequent pregnancies.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446908545/wxz2gfpdsmfsypelbuhf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This film will encourage discussion, community and healing for so many people. It will start a dialogue. It will shed light on a secret pain. It will be an education on healthy (and not-so-healthy) approaches to grief and healing. It will also show how creativity can be a balm to the wounded spirit. In this way, <b>Expecting Sunshine</b> will speak to viewers on many levels.</p>

<h2><b>Pregnancy After Loss:</b></h2>
<p>What many do not realize is that pregnancy after loss is actually an incredibly difficult time. Some believe conceiving after loss is a natural state of moving-on or a helpful distraction. On the contrary, it often brings to the surface many unaddressed issues, relational strains and fears.</p>

<p><b><i>Expecting Sunshine the Documentary</i></b> chronicles Alexis Marie Chute’s experience of surviving pregnancy following Zachary's death and navigating the delicate balance of anticipation and anxiety.</p>
<p>As an artist and writer, the perspective Alexis Marie brings to this project is a surreal and intimate one. She invites viewers into her creative perceptions of grief and healing, presenting her darkest days and also her moments of hard-earned resiliency and triumph. Anyone who has lost a person will connect with her reflections and be inspired by her stubborn determination to find the sunshine, the hope in times of personal trials.  </p>

Expecting
Sunshine the Documentary tells the story of writer

“luminous prose and with such clear-eyed insight,” Chute reveals the turbulent 40-week experience of having a baby after loss. Poignant, touching, tender and inspiring, Expecting Sunshine “makes
death a starting point for the continuation of life.”


Why this Project is Meaningful and Needs your Support:
In 2010, Alexis Marie Chute’s son Zachary died at birth. He had a random genetic condition and a large tumor around his heart. Doctors predicted that Zachary would be stillborn, but he was born alive. He never made a sound or opened his eyes. Alexis Marie and her husband Aaron rocked and sang to Zachary. They only had a moment with their son before he died – and that was the moment that changed their lives forever.



When Alexis Marie got pregnant again with her next child, at first she was thrilled. Soon, though, that excitement turned to worry and a debilitating fear for her next baby's life and safety. Would this child suffer the same fate? 
In the 40 weeks that followed, she realized she needed to address her grief for Zachary, which she had tried to bury, before the birth of the child that followed. That is when Expecting Sunshine the Memoir was born; it became a creative narrative of survival. Expecting Sunshine the Documentary is the visual and literary manifestation of that experience.
The topic of Expecting Sunshine the Documentary is often taboo and uncomfortable for people who have not experienced this type of loss – which is exactly why there is a need for this film. Many do not know what to say or how to empathize with the bereaved parents, despite wishing to help. What this means is that families can feel isolated and suffer in silence, especially when they struggle with subsequent pregnancies.



This film will encourage discussion, community and healing for so many people. It will start a dialogue. It will shed light on a secret pain. It will be an education on healthy (and not-so-healthy) approaches to grief and healing. It will also show how creativity can be a balm to the wounded spirit. In this way, Expecting Sunshine will speak to viewers on many levels.


Pregnancy After Loss:
What many do not realize is that pregnancy after loss is actually an incredibly difficult time. Some believe conceiving after loss is a natural state of moving-on or a helpful distraction. On the contrary, it often brings to the surface many unaddressed issues, relational strains and fears.




Expecting Sunshine the Documentary chronicles Alexis Marie Chute’s experience of surviving pregnancy following Zachary's death and navigating the delicate balance of anticipation and anxiety.
As an artist and writer, the perspective Alexis Marie brings to this project is a surreal and intimate one. She invites viewers into her creative perceptions of grief and healing, presenting her darkest days and also her moments of hard-earned resiliency and triumph. Anyone who has lost a person will connect with her reflections and be inspired by her stubborn determination to find the sunshine, the hope in times of personal trials.

</h3><div>
<b>Victor H. Green was a Harlem  letter carrier with a 7th 
grade education</b> who used his pre-internet post office network to help make 
difficult and even dangerous travel situations safe and enjoyable for 
African-Americans, both in the US and abroad. Starting in 1936 and for the rest of his 
life, he published guidebooks to connect travelers with motels, restaurants, gas stations, and other black and white-owned businesses who would 
welcome African-Americans.  During this time of the Great Migration, many Southern black families attempted to escape Jim Crow laws by moving North, needing information and guidance from the Green Books about how to safely visit family and friends who remained back home. As cars became more affordable through the middle of the 20th century, African-Americans found they needed safe havens in order to travel anywhere in the country, not just in the South.<br/><br/><b>In this film, we want to honor and 
celebrate Victor Green and others who have been incredibly resourceful 
and determined to help others on the road during the Jim Crow era.<br/><br/></b><i><b>Below: </b>Victor H. Green (c. 1955) flanked by Green Books from 1940 and 1949</i><br/>

</h3>
Through his award-winning children's book, ""Ruth and the Green Book"" (2010), <b>Calvin Alexander Ramsey </b>(Co-Producer) has helped rescue Victor H. Green's 30 year series of travel guides for African Americans from obscurity. For the last decade, Ramsey has emerged as one of the foremost experts on the Green Books, also producing a play for adults and currently developing a musical. Born in Baltimore, growing up Ramsey's family relocated to South Carolina as part of the ""reverse migration."" Calvin lectures extensively about the Green Book in the New York area and beyond as well as on radio. <br/><br/>You can hear Calvin speaking about the Green Book with interview clips from the film on the WUNC North Carolina public radio show, ""The State of Things"" here:   <a href=""http://wunc.org/post/green-book-chronicles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://wunc.org/post/green-book-chronicles</a><a href=""http://wunc.org/post/green-book-chronicles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://wunc.org/post/green-book-chronicles</a><i><br/><br/></i>

The Team

Through his award-winning children's book, ""Ruth and the Green Book"" (2010), Calvin Alexander Ramsey (Co-Producer) has helped rescue Victor H. Green's 30 year series of travel guides for African Americans from obscurity. For the last decade, Ramsey has emerged as one of the foremost experts on the Green Books, also producing a play for adults and currently developing a musical. Born in Baltimore, growing up Ramsey's family relocated to South Carolina as part of the ""reverse migration."" Calvin lectures extensively about the Green Book in the New York area and beyond as well as on radio. You can hear Calvin speaking about the Green Book with interview clips from the film on the WUNC North Carolina public radio show, ""The State of Things"" here:   http://wunc.org/post/green-book-chronicleshttp://wunc.org/post/green-book-chronicles
For 14 years, Becky Wible Searles (Director/Co-Producer) owned her own award-winning animation production company in New York City, creating short form mixed-media animation with live action for clients including Nickelodeon, National Geographic, AT&T, Showtime, and Kool-Aid, appearing on-camera in two episodes of the PBS series, ""Reading Rainbow"". She has been on the animation faculty of Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) Atlanta since 2009,  with previous positions at SCAD's Savannah campus as well as NYC's School of Visual Arts and Pratt Institute. Originally from Ohio, Becky's distant family ancestors owned a tavern on Lake Erie that was rumored to be a stop on the Underground Railway.



From Becky and Calvin:

Sharing a love for untold stories, we joined forces in 2012 to explore combining live action documentary interviews about the Green Book, and related travel stories during Jim Crow, with vintage travel imagery and animation inspired by the Green Books themselves. What started out as a short film with a student, faculty, and volunteer professional crew at SCAD Atlanta has blossomed into a much more extensive one hour film project with broadcast potential, demanding that we take it to another level.
After producing the initial short film material, we regrouped and moved forward in summer 2015 with a professional crew (including some SCAD graduates) to film additional interviews and footage in a number of NYC locations, including the Jacob Lawrence ""Migration Series"" at the Museum of Modern Art and the extensive Green Book collection at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, as well as various locations in Harlem, including the legendary jazz club, Minton's.  
Simultaneously we've been connecting with and gathering material from many other individuals and organizations nationwide who have Green Book and Jim Crow-era travel stories to tell, such as the Hotel Dumas in Roanoke, Va (a sort of Minton's for the Southeast) and the National Association of Letter Carriers in Washington, DC of which Victor Green was a member, to name just a few. A number of additional animation segments are also underway and the first piece of music has been commissioned and completed for the ""Mapping Jim Crow"" section of the film by Hank Roberts and Tenzin from Lyra Music, an excerpt of which can be heard in the trailer.
And we are very excited to recently welcome Dr. Michael R. Ragan and Dr. 
Deborah V. Payton George from Miami as Associate Producers for ""The Green Book 
Chronicles""! (pictured below).


TREMENDOUS THANKS to the many students, crew, interviewees, and friends who have helped us get this far! YOUR SUPPORT can help us get to the finish line with a one hour, high quality film, suitable for film festivals, television, and DVD release!

<p><i>Shared Rooms</i> is a feel-good romantic comedy that explores the meaning of home and family through three interrelated stories of gay men finding connections during the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day:</p>
<ul>
<li>A married couple who take in a teenage relative who was kicked out of his home after his parents discovered he was gay.</li>

<p>We completed principal photography in November 2015, and now we're deep into post production - and that's where we need your help.

understand the power of his music and the spirit it carries. He came to the United States in 1978 at the age of 24 without speaking much English and to follow his music passion. Soon after his arrival in 1979, Neto auditioned for the legendary <a href=""http://singyoursongthemovie.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Harry Belafonte</a>  who then invited Neto to join his band. For thirty years Neto toured and performed with Belafonte and then became his music director as well for ten years. <br/></p>
<p>José is a founding member of the band <a href=""http://www.melt.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=265:fourth-world&amp;catid=24:melt-artist-catalogue&amp;Itemid=74"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fourth World</a>  with the  legendary master percussionist <a href=""http://www.airto.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Airto Moreira</a> and Brazil's Queen of Jazz <a href=""http://www.florapurim.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Flora Purim </a>who
 started José's journey at Ronnie's Scotts Jazz Club in 1990. Neto is 
still composing and recording with Airto Moreira today. <br/></p>
<p>In 1995, Jim Capaldi, the great drummer and songwriter of Traffic, came to Ronnie Scotts Jazz Club in London in the afternoon and jammed with José Neto and Airto Moreira. After Capaldi saw the their band Fourth World perform that night, he brought master musician <a href=""http://www.stevewinwood.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steve Winwood</a> the very 
next day to hear the band and Neto's ""apocalyptic sounds"" as his music has been 
described in <i>The</i> <i>London Times</i>. That introduction to Steve led
them to a musical friendship with multiple jams with Neto's own band, The Netoband. A few years later Winwood asked Neto to join him in an Organ Trio, Winwood's new project (more Traffic style) and they recorded About Time. Neto has been Winwood's guitarist for the last 14 years and has collaborated with Winwood on several songs for the CDs About Time and Nine Lives. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Neto has been leading his own band The Netoband for over 25 years. Those members are Gary Brown, Frank Martin, Celso Alberti and Café. They've toured internationally and each member is a highly respected musician in his own right. <br/></p>
<p>Neto also plays, performs and records with producer and master drummer <a href=""http://www.nmwproductions.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Narada Michael Walden</a> and Kirtan master <a href=""http://jaiuttal.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jai Utall</a>. <br/></p>
<p>Despite all of Neto's contributions to international world music, Director Barbara McVeigh was incredibly surprised to learn how little the mainstream knows about Neto.  He didn't even have a Wikipedia entry up until last year.  Yet, she discovered there was a select group of international fans who were highly devoted to Neto's music and how well he was respected by legendary musicians and producers.<br/></p>
<p>As Barbara got to know Neto, she began to understand him. He's very soft spoken and self effacing. There is no ego involved and he always looks to shine the spotlight on someone else. As music journalist Paul Liberatore says about Neto, ""He is in service to music and not to fame.""  <br/></p>
<p>This film will cast the light on this man behind the white guitar as we 
follow him to Brazil, New York,  England and California to learn about 
his past and those who have taught and inspired him to be the man and 
musician he is today. Neto's diverse musical journey and deep life 
challenges have taught him 
the values of loyalty, devotion and positive vision that speak through 
his sounds and performing spirit. He has touched the lives of the most 
unsuspecting fans worldwide. <br/></p>

The inspiration and comfort this medium gives to so many is a story that hasn’t yet received the attention it deserves.</p><p>In 2009 things went crazy for me and my family. We were living in Virginia when I was downsized, leaving us with a mortgage and a feeling of What now?  Times were tough. No one was hiring. This downward spiral lasted for a few years, forcing us to return home to New Jersey to live with relatives.</p><p>I was in a deep, dark depression.

Podcasting is a new digital communications medium thatis not only changing the way people consume media, it is changing peoples lives.Through my journey, I have met fellow podcasters, and listeners, whom I nowcall friends. The inspiration and comfort this medium gives to so many is a story that hasn’t yet received the attention it deserves.In 2009 things went crazy for me and my family. We were living in Virginia when I was downsized, leaving us with a mortgage and a feeling of What now?  Times were tough. No one was hiring. This downward spiral lasted for a few years, forcing us to return home to New Jersey to live with relatives.I was in a deep, dark depression. At my lowest, I picked up a book from thefamous movie director and podcast pioneer, Kevin Smith. The book gave me permission to do something crazy, if not desperate. Do itStart a podcastGo talk on the internet with your friends.And so I did, starting my own highly successful podcast: ThatMan on Fatman.But this film is not just about my journey. Its the journey of the manypodcasters, and listeners, friends and family, and how this medium is changing, helping, and even saving peoples lives, let alone building communities. The world is now at everyone's fingertips and podcasters are the pioneers of a new digital age and medium.Please join me in this insider look of a world heading for tomorrow.To Accomplish This VisionBased on researching other projects in the same range and scope of the documentary we will be shooting, and discussions with other experienced filmmakers, we are looking to keep the production budget to 15k (U.S. Dollars) and anticipate the costs to fall into the following cost centers.
Research, Archival Photographs, Stock Footage & Film Clips -8%
Production Expenses - Costs associated camera, sound, lighting and grip equipment, the facilities and the services required to shoot the documentary. - 21%
Travel Expenses - There will be filming in multiple locations. - 19%
Editorial - Editing Fee - 20%
Music - Film Scoring & Music Rights - 8%
Administrative Costs/Professional Fees - 8%
Insurance - 8%
Promotional  - 8%
 Please note, our initial IGG campaign took in about $2200. And between that and our own personal investments, this project has gotten further than we ever anticipated. At this time we could really use your help to offset the costs of wrapping up shooting.
Social ImpactAs an avid and active podcaster, I have experienced and witnessed how this new communications medium has enriched peoples lives. Yet podcasting is still a mystery to many. This film hopes to shed a real light on the people who have pioneered, embraced, and are even redefining the potential of this new communications tool. It's an amazing story about technology and about people that just needs to be told.Risks & Challenges

</div></div>","Sublime Visions engages the leading chemists, doctors, therapists and visionaries who are actively working with psychedelics as contemporary therapeutic medicines to inspire and facilitate deep healing processes. The mission of this multi­platform project is to unveil the personal side of psychedelic medicines, and to be an approachable and identifiable source of information that builds greater awareness of advances in the reputable use of psychedelics in medicine, art and education.In its final form, this project will be a book, an exhibition, a film, a web, and social media presence all aimed at a general audience.  As an artistic creation, it will resonate emotionally with the audience, while carrying the weight of credible, up to date information.  The photography will be a finely crafted collection of environmental portraits and detail oriented ethnographic photographs of each participant.  By visiting the living and working environments of the participants, thus sharing their personal story, we gain a greater understanding of who they are, what their values and morals are and what motivates them.  We will see with our own eyes how each person has integrated their work in their lives.  Once we are able to see and understand a person, it becomes easier to trust the work that they are doing.  The photographs, stories and inverviews will allow each viewer to personally discover the people working with the medicines, and will show a glimpse into the essence that makes each individual unique and principled.The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is serving as non-profit fiscal sponsor for Sublime Visions, and helping liaison with Sublime Visions participants and project promotion.  MAPS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit research and educational organization that develops medical, legal, and cultural contexts for people to benefit from the careful uses of psychedelics and marijuana. Their fiscal sponsorship gives Sublime Visions availability for grants as well as making all donations to Sublime Visions tax-deductible in the U.S. MAPS is not directly funding the project.    www.maps.orgAlready, we have had the honor to visit with a few extraordinary, kind, open and accomplished people who have been gracious in inviting us into their homes and hearts; and have promised agreements for future visits with more.*Alexandar's 'Sasha' Shulgin's home laboratoryAlexandar ‘Sasha’ Shulgin, Ph.D. ~ an American Medicinal Chemist, Biochemist, Pharmacologist, Psychopharmacologist and Author. 
Sasha began studying organic chemistry as a Harvard university student at the age of 16, and went on to earn his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of California Berkeley in 1954.  He has a vast lifetime of accomplishments, studies and publications, including receiving several awards from the DEA.  Sasha and his wife Ann Shulgin authored the books PIHKAL and TIHKAL, which have become guides of psychoactive drugs for an entire generation.  Sasha is credited with introducing MDMA (Ecstasy) to psychologists in the late 1970’s for psychopharmaceutical use, and due in part to his extensive work in the field of psychedelic research and the rational drug design of psychedelic drugs, he is considered the ‘Godfather of Psychedelics’.

<p>In March of 2015, SkEye Studios traveled from our home in Portland, Oregon, to Spokane, Washington, where we interviewed Scotty and his wife Tiffany for the first time.</p>
<p>When we first heard Scotty's story, we wanted to drop everything and tell it. As a very young production company with only 3 employees, this seemed impossible to do on our own. We reached out and were met with a wealth of support from those who responded to our call for help. Our previous campaign met and exceeded our financial goal in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>While the support we received from that first campaign was enough to fund the development and principal photography of <i>Beat Feet</i>, we knew it would take more resources to give Scotty's story the recognition it deserves.</p>

</div></div>","Overcoming Adversity
Life is full of challenges. This is especially true for Scotty Smiley, a retired US Army veteran from Spokane, Washington.  On April 6, 2005, during his deployment in Mosul, Iraq, Scotty was hit by a suicide car bomb, leaving him permanently blind.






Scotty has spent the last ten years attempting feats deemed extremely difficult for those with sight, and nearly impossible without it. Scotty has climbed mountains, gone skydiving, surfed, and written a book, all without the use of his eyes. On June 28, 2015, Scotty competed in the Coeur d'Alene Ironman triathlon, accompanied by his racing guide and brother-in-law, Andy Cooper.





Beat Feet: a documentary by SkEye Studios


In March of 2015, SkEye Studios traveled from our home in Portland, Oregon, to Spokane, Washington, where we interviewed Scotty and his wife Tiffany for the first time.
When we first heard Scotty's story, we wanted to drop everything and tell it. As a very young production company with only 3 employees, this seemed impossible to do on our own. We reached out and were met with a wealth of support from those who responded to our call for help. Our previous campaign met and exceeded our financial goal in just a few weeks.
While the support we received from that first campaign was enough to fund the development and principal photography of Beat Feet, we knew it would take more resources to give Scotty's story the recognition it deserves.






Since we traveled to Coeur d'Alene in June to film Scotty's Ironman race, we have spent hundreds of hours assembling and refining the footage we shot, spending long nights and weekends putting the finishing touches on the film. It is now about 90 percent complete, but we need your help to tell this story to the world. 
Narrated by Coach Mike Krzyzewski
We are very excited to welcome head coach of Duke basketball Mike Krzyzewski as part of the documentary team as narrator.  Coach K is long time friend and supporter of Scott Smiley.

many, coming from beneath the ground to the sky and beyond the stars.Click here to read some of the Unwanted Publicity Guy's Blog [ http://www.projectcamelotvnetwork.org/blogs/unw... ]Referenceshttp://www.projectcamelotvnetwork.org/blogs/unw...- -SOURCE: Project Camelot ProductionsDisclosure 1: Financial Insecurity - Part A - Investigationby, The Unwanted Publicity Intelligence Guy ( Paul Collin )December 23, 2014""...Unwanted Publicity Intelligence files are quite extensive displaying a plethora of assets, precious metal bullion ( platinum and gold bar international legacy heritance keys, certificates, transactional documentations, passports, agreements, U.S. government contract consultancies involving the principals of the SUMMA CORPORORATION Knights Of Malta ( O.S.J. ), Conrad Hilton international financial records, United States Bank and China, legacy Japan Treasuries, Switzerland - Germany Treasuries, legacy Philippine Treasuries, legacy Indonesia Treasuries, and other national treasury assets previously held in a Howard Hughes vault in Nevada.The information is extremely voluminous and awaiting funding through The Unwanted Publicity Guy so everything 'without fear of duplication' can be properly displayed publicly for everyone to be able to discover more than they will ever be able to read non-stop in 3-years;

It was the perfect opportunity to learn everything about production and story and to do so under the wing of some of the world's greatest. I also discovered a passion for interviewing people when I met my Oregon native husband, Pippin, who has been a videographer for 20 years.

<p>When Pippin and I met Bing, what was supposed to be a 30-minute interview turned into something so much more. Three hours later, and on the second floor at his modest desk at SERA Architects, our camera was still rolling as the 81-year old Portland icon poured over details about what this ""village"" of Portland was like when he arrived from Copenhagen in the 1960's. Towards the end of this interview was when we discovered that our City was sitting on a gold mine; a wealth of stories that described how we got to be so awesome--and that it has never been eloquently told as a feature on this platform.</p>

<p>Everyone knows what a hot topic our city is today and that frequent comparisons are running up and down the West Coast.

The Time is Now: Portland will shine on the Big Screen!

 Hello, My name is Kristen Kingsbury. 
I moved to Portland from NY in 2006 to work on the Academy Award Nominated Feature,""Coraline"". It was the perfect opportunity to learn everything about production and story and to do so under the wing of some of the world's greatest. I also discovered a passion for interviewing people when I met my Oregon native husband, Pippin, who has been a videographer for 20 years. This type of storytelling never existed in me anywhere else and the reason is simple: The people in Portland are fascinating to talk to and learn from. Their personalities and what they're talking about, when combined, is pure art.
Enough About Me, just who is this BING SHELDON ?


When Pippin and I met Bing, what was supposed to be a 30-minute interview turned into something so much more. Three hours later, and on the second floor at his modest desk at SERA Architects, our camera was still rolling as the 81-year old Portland icon poured over details about what this ""village"" of Portland was like when he arrived from Copenhagen in the 1960's. Towards the end of this interview was when we discovered that our City was sitting on a gold mine; a wealth of stories that described how we got to be so awesome--and that it has never been eloquently told as a feature on this platform.
Fast Forward to Now.
Everyone knows what a hot topic our city is today and that frequent comparisons are running up and down the West Coast. The changes to the Portland we know feels more like sand slipping through our fingers and at this rate, we're afraid we'll all be staring at our empty hands after it's run it's course. We described this feeling to Bing and asked him what could be done about it. His answer: ""This city was actively run by the people before. Now is the time to get back to it.""
But We Don't Want to Live in the Past, This is About the Future!
While our film promises to deliver those beautiful stories in the voices that are still around to tell them, we also feel it's responsible to respond to the recent high-impact emotional twist that has lodged itself into this story: What about the now? What about the future? Is what's being designed for us even good enough? How do we have more say in what our city becomes?
Portland Was Once a Guinea Pig, Nourished with a (grass-fed) Radical Sense of Self.
Your contribution will turn national and international attention to the problems that cities are facing everywhere, but with Portland as the winning example. Half a century ago, our city went left when everyone else turned right. This social impact film will remind us to put our values to the test again, and put an end to the threat of Portland's well-being.   What We Need & What You Get
Lights, Camera, Action!

We're ready to get started. The script is developed and we want to assemble our production team. Our funding will determine how cinematic our story can become and the higher the quality, the bigger the stage. While our target for production is $250,000, we're after obtaining $15,000 to start so we can add more fuel to the fire of this production. Simply put, we need to market this smartly to ensure the rest of funds raised will not go towards hindsight.  The most successful films are the ones that have used every opportunity possible for pre-production planning and that includes leading with image. Other funds will go towards employing a highly talented Oregon production crew (pictured above is Portlandia Producer, David Cress who has donated SO MUCH of his time to this already), for graphics and music scoring, as well as renting camera equipment and purchasing things such as hardware for adequate storage. We also need to pay for the perks we promise, pay taxes on what we raise and allow IndieGoGo their piece of the pie for providing their platform. If we can double the $250k production goal, we'll be able to open this film with the most captivating intro ever known to documentary film. 
That's a promise! 

Sounds Fun, What Do I Get for Helping?

I'm so glad you asked. We'll offer limited run Portland Inc T-Shirts and Hoodies, DVDs, invites to private screenings and premiere parties--after all--This is Portland, we want to meet you, hear from you and toast with you!
What else can you do to offer MORE OF PORTLAND as a gift for my support?

Thoughtfully designed themed necklaces, block printed canvas bags, and other items will be available as our way of saying thanks while supporting our local artists.
A Contest?
We're working on putting out a contest call for cover art appropriate to the theme of the film. We'll offer posters of the winner, voted by you! There's room for runners up as well. Stay tuned for details.
Strength in numbers.
If we don't reach the ceiling, we're prepared to make this film on a shoestring. However, we feel that our city and it's accompanying challenges deserve our very best --which includes surrounding this project with Oregon based talent so it can stand confidently on a platform for the world to see. Your support will strengthen it's success for high quality immensely.
   The Impact Why Feature Film?
We've toyed with the idea of creating a small-scale series. But we think that because of Portland, we can do better and would like to offer more than a tripod-based-90-minute-video of talking heads. I'm not sure I could even make it through that type of film. So let's get creative and make something we'd LOVE to see up on the big screen!

Risks & Challenges
 Swimming in Shark Infested Waters...Come on in, The Water's Fine!
Filmmaking is always risky. It is impossible to give 100% of your audience a warm fuzzy feeling. Our sole objective is to tell the story of Portland in the best way possible; which will definitely excite, anger and entertain. There is a possibility that we will barely reach our goal and will tell this story from the confines of our tiny equipment. There is a possibility that we won't be able to tell the Portland that you know to be true, that segments you think are important will not be included but we promise not to mishandle information. We also promise to adequately represent all sides as best as we can. This is why your support in the process of making this film is so critical. We'll post behind-the-scenes segments, regular updates and expect to hear from you along the way.
We've put this campaign off for awhile. Mostly because we were fearful of being the recipient of cutting comments and of course, failing to raise the kind of funds that we feel are important. Putting ourselves out there like this is a little distressing, but as I've said in the video, it's far less cumbersome than the feeling of regret.
Best case vs. worst case scenario.
The worst possible outcome is a micro-budget documentary made with our meek Canon 60D, some lights and crafty paper animation. The best case scenario includes an out-of-this-world intro and a high quality piece of art surrounded by Oregon talent (read: we love supporting other creatives and what better way to do so than to give them a job, some credit and more experience that they needn't travel to Hollywood for?) plus a Portland-centric premiere.

Other Ways You Can Help
 If you can't contribute, that is OK!  The Portland way is also about donating time instead of funds. We place high value on your participation in spreading the word through your own network. Please utilize the Share tools from IndieGoGo to create the biggest splash.

</div></div>","Dark Spirit Films needs your help to make the feature 80's style dark fantasy/horror film, Beyond Hell. The film is in post production and your support will determine the quality of the final film.We still have a lot of work to do, but here is your first look at what's coming for Beyond Hell.

Maryssa seemingly has the perfect life, however her ""Leave it to Beaver"" lifestyle is a prison she wants to escape. After trying a new version of the drug changa with friends, Maryssa finds herself transported to a hell dimension where the demon, Belial, latches on to her. Using Maryssa as a tether to our world, Belial begins killing her friends one by one in horrific hallucinations. Maryssa and her surviving friends must find a way to stop him before he is freed and brings hell to earth.





Alan Murray, the Director/Creator of Beyond Hell has always had a passion for horror. Inspired by his favorite horror films, including Nightmare on Elm street and Hellraiser, his vision was to bring some of these forgotten stylistic elements back into the horror genre. He has seen this project come full circle through much hard work and determination and will likely be involved in most of the post production as well due to his background in digital animation.

Gavin Downes, the Co-producer and Actor playing Belial in Beyond Hell, was first cast as the creature before the film had been fully written. Gavin has been with this project since day one . Alongside Alan he has ensured that it captured the 80's style horror ambiance that the two had envisioned since the beginning.

Kat Murray, Production Manager and Author of the Beyond Hell novel has been alongside for the entire Beyond Hell ride. Multi-tasking everything from Craft and Wardrobe to Production Management and the conversion of the original script into a novel. Kat is known for her Chronicles of Hart series and she brings a love of plots and literature to the project, ensuring that the novel and movie captured the same stylistic elements.We have some fantastic perks to offer for your support, take a look at them on the side bar right there.

Bathory (1560-1614) started on november 2008 and ended on october 2009. 
We had just finished this trailer when some rushes, hundreds of hours of
 footage, were stolen 3 months later. They were never recovered and the 
producer gave up the project. Today, after a few years of 
hesitation, we decided to give it a second chance and complete the 
documentary for a release in dvd/bluray. What we need and whyDespite some remaining footage, we don't have any more producer so we 
need a minimum of funds to create a film production society, buy equipment and go on 
location in Slovakia for more film stock to compensate the stolen 
footages. Though we should be able to manage all right with 20.000 
euros, every extra contribution past our goal would help us even more to
 buy more and better equipment for our new Prod. However, in the
 worst case scenario, the funds we will get will help us create our film
 production society and we will not give up our project. One day or 
another, ELIZABETH BATHORY, A PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION will be fully completed and released !About the directorBorn in France in 1964, Philippe R. Welté is a writer and paranormal investigator. He has always been fascinated by the unknown and unexplained phenomenas.In
 1985, he decided to visit Whitechapel, once Jack the Ripper's hunting
grounds and felt the spectral presence of a young woman. Intrigued
by the mystery of this strange encounter, he decided to focus on the
Whitechapel killer and his preys. A best-seller in France in 2006, his book ""JACK THE RIPPER, the secret
of Mary Jane K."" is
 the result of 20 years of investigations. Why produce Elizabeth BATHORY, A PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION ?""Many rumors have spread about her for centuries. She was a

<h3><b>What is our story?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1968 Dr Richard Alpert returned from India as Ram Dass and through his commitment to sharing his path turned on a new generation to the spiritual wisdom of the East. From that point forward a revolution in consciousness brought together a vast and diverse spiritual community of fellow searchers on the path to inner fulfillment.
</p>
<p>Some of the travelers on the path met very early in those days in India and became a very close family made up of both Buddhists and Bhakti’s. It was this diversity yet singularity of purpose that led me to contemplate bringing these teachers together under one umbrella of conscious inner social action. And it was Duncan Trussell who provided the clue- podcasts!</p>
<p>With the birth of Mindrolling and my partnership with David Silver, that idea grew to include our India family- Ram Dass, Sharon Salzberg, Jack Kornfield, Krishna Das and Lama Surya Das. It was that mix of devotional heart practice and the wisdom of the Buddha that is now the foundation of the Mindpod Network: a destination on multiple platforms for Heart Mind Wisdom and the practical and easy application of that wisdom for anyone at any level to connect with and utilize in their lives. </p>
<p>It is that unique blending that attracted me from the very beginning when I followed Ram Dass back to India where I first met Neem Karoli Baba and felt I had been given the tools to follow a life path of inspiration, balance and connection. And so we really have gone full circle and followed Ram Dass' example to share and carry forward our experience. It’s so very gratifying to see how quickly such a substantial community has been created in such a short time. </p>
<p>May we be blessed to have this network reach out to whomever wants to share this collective spiritual heart.</p>

“As far as I’m concerned the only thing we
need to renounce is our self-hatred and judgment of ourselves, and our sense of
unworthiness, and our sense that we are not worthy of love. This is where we
should start. If we could just work with that place a little bit the whole
quality of our lives would change.”
—  Krishna Das



What is our story?


In 1968 Dr Richard Alpert returned from India as Ram Dass and through his commitment to sharing his path turned on a new generation to the spiritual wisdom of the East. From that point forward a revolution in consciousness brought together a vast and diverse spiritual community of fellow searchers on the path to inner fulfillment.

Some of the travelers on the path met very early in those days in India and became a very close family made up of both Buddhists and Bhakti’s. It was this diversity yet singularity of purpose that led me to contemplate bringing these teachers together under one umbrella of conscious inner social action. And it was Duncan Trussell who provided the clue- podcasts!
With the birth of Mindrolling and my partnership with David Silver, that idea grew to include our India family- Ram Dass, Sharon Salzberg, Jack Kornfield, Krishna Das and Lama Surya Das. It was that mix of devotional heart practice and the wisdom of the Buddha that is now the foundation of the Mindpod Network: a destination on multiple platforms for Heart Mind Wisdom and the practical and easy application of that wisdom for anyone at any level to connect with and utilize in their lives. 
It is that unique blending that attracted me from the very beginning when I followed Ram Dass back to India where I first met Neem Karoli Baba and felt I had been given the tools to follow a life path of inspiration, balance and connection. And so we really have gone full circle and followed Ram Dass' example to share and carry forward our experience. It’s so very gratifying to see how quickly such a substantial community has been created in such a short time. 
May we be blessed to have this network reach out to whomever wants to share this collective spiritual heart.
- Raghu Markus

“Learning how to love is the goal and the purpose of spiritual life - not learning how to develop psychic powers, not learning how to bow, chant, do yoga, or even meditate, but learning to love. Love is the truth. Love is the light.”- Lama Surya Das

<p>We have celebrated hundreds
of birthdays and created thousands of smiles, but there are some that really
show the BIG IMPACT we can make in a child’s life.  Recently, we
celebrated a young man's birthday who had never celebrated his birthday. 
This young man enjoyed the games and was excited to see the birthday cake with lighted
candles. As the lights were dimmed, David* began to cry. For the first time he
felt love; for the first time he felt compassion; for the first time he was
able to make a birthday wish! As the cake was being cut, David quickly began
washing off the decorations from the cake to save as keepsakes. He said that he
wanted to treasure every minute of the best birthday ever. David was 20 years
old that day. To many, birthdays are expected; to some a birthday is just another
day. Sweet Celebrations is more than a party; it is understanding; it
is love, and it is joy. We provide Little Celebrations with a Big Impact.<span>  With your help, we can create many more
smiles and literally change more lives.</span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Todd Ryznar has taken adversity and bad luck and turned it on it’s head. When you’re at the bottom, the only place left to go is up. But bottom has it’s own timetable -- days become weeks, and summer soon turns to fall.  ""Living The Dream, Asshole"" is Todd’s story about kicking reality up it’s butt!  Take that!   Burdened with a cast on his foot and down to his last few smokes, he’s knows there’s something special in the telling of this story.  It’s not a normal situation, nor is this going to be a normal film.<br/>This campaign will take us to the next step. There are time and costs to write the script, to work with actors, travel, to network with production companies to bring this idea to the people that can help get it made, and showcase it to the world. The dedication and commitment shows in what is done already, and any support will relieve some of our own personal costs to keep going. Indie means we want to control the creative content at this early stage…</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is $12,000 which will cover equipment rental, any  additional shooting, posters, graphic design, a story editor to help with the script and some overhead costs.  The key to a good movie is a good script -- the story has to be on the page and it has to be told well.  Writing is the most fundamental element of any movie regardless of the genre, and your support will contribute to a very unique first draft of a feature length script.</p>
<p>We will take every person’s name and have a draw for 3 people.  When the script is being written we will include these names, and they will appear in the movie in an inventive manner: perhaps your name will be stenciled on the beach ball Todd bonks Braydon on the head with!  Or Todd will sign your name on his cast…. Or it will be spelled out with whipping cream on the pumpkin pie… It will be a treasure hunt for your sweet enjoyment.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Kiara Simmons, and I am a filmmaker currently in high school. I have been around film my entire life and started trying to create my own when I was around 10 years old. I began first with creating my own short films, then I started formulating ideas for feature films and series. This will be my first time bringing one of those ideas to life.</p>
<p>I am starting this campaign because although I have some actors, locations, and a few crew members, I still need more, and will have to pay for them, as well as feed and transport everyone. I would also like to have a showing of my movie at a local theater, if possible. This is extremely important to me, as it will help further my knowledge and experience in film, as well as further the knowledge and experience of the cast and crew.</p>
<p>Contributing to this campaign would not only further drive the careers, portfolios, and knowledge of a group of students but will also share a funny, relatable story with the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $20,000 to cover the costs of the production. This includes paying the cast and crew, feeding the cast and crew, locations, transportation, distribution, marketing, and the showing.</p>
<p>15% will go to locations<br/>15% will go to food<br/>5% will go to transportation<br/>20% will go to distribution<br/>15% will go to the actors<br/>15% will go to the crew<br/>10% will go to marketing<br/>5% will go to the showing</p>
<p>Perks are available for donations as low as $15. The perks get better the more you donate, and range from an electronic copy of the movie to an invitation to the showing and executive producer credits!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal of $20,000, we will still create the best movie possible with the money we have, but we may not be able to have the showing (sad, I know)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributing to this project will not only help a group of students further their knowledge, portfolios, and current or future careers, but it will also inspire and share happiness with others.</p>
<p>""Caught Up"" is a comedy, as I wanted to share a story that would leave people happy and have them laughing after they watch it. I always want to spread happiness, and this is a platform in which I can do so.</p>
<p>Your contribution will also inspire other young filmmakers such as myself. Many teen filmmakers shy away from any kind of big project because the people in this industry do not take us seriously. If other young filmmakers can see the success of this project, they will take on their own, and the industry will begin to see more of the creativity, drive, and hard work of more teenage filmmakers.</p>.</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Because I am such a young filmmaker, as I mentioned earlier, I am not taken very seriously. I realized this and have made sure that I have a dedicated cast and crew who are just as excited for this project and are willing to put in just as much effort and time as I am. I also have a dedicated team behind me to make sure that everything runs smoothly.</p>
<p>As with any project, there are risks involved. One of those risks for us is if we don't raise much money at all. If this does happen, filming will have to be temporarily postponed, but we do have some backup fundraising methods and will use whatever money we can raise or use out-of-pocket to fund it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute right now, don't worry. There are other ways you can help, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>sharing this campaign with others and encouraging them to donate</li>
<li>talking about the project with others and spreading the word on social media</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This crowd-funding campaign is over now but we are still very grateful for any direct contributions you feel moved to offer.  We can offer the same perks of downloads of therapeutic Nature films as a thank you for contributions between £25-£100.   Please send any contributions by PayPal to bryonytree@googlemail.com.</p>
<p>We are two film-makers with over thirty years combined experience of filming and engaging deeply with Nature.  We have each felt Nature's healing power in significant ways, and we want to explore and share this phenomenon.  The film will engage with innovative people, projects and perspectives.  We will interview Health professionals, researchers, patients, traditional elders and creative artists from different cultures, exploring their experience, wisdom and understanding of Nature's role in the healing process.</p>
<p>We are exploring the scientific ground for creative, spiritual and everyday ways of connecting with Nature for healing benefits.  We will interweave interviews with scientists and artists with the voices of indigenous elders, to explore the points at which these worlds touch, and are similar.  We aim to inspire wider understanding, learning and to promote discussion about our connections, health and well-being. We want to inspire positive change in the educational and health related systems that support us. This film will provide a valuable resource of simple, cost-effective strategies and innovations for Health and Education, and more widely in society, for supporting people's healing.</p>
<p>Our skills, experiences and knowledge uniquely equip us to engage deeply with this topic.   The relationships we have already formed with some of the health and Nature specialists, and indigenous elders, we hope to interview, give the project a strong start.  We are drawing on Mark Minard' s seventeen years working with powerful Nature imagery and Bryony Roger's twelve years work in community documentary film-making.</p>

<p>Mark Minard (Director and Camera)</p>
<p>Mark has been creating and bringing specialist nature films into hospitals, prisons and school environments for seventeen years, with great positive effect.  These films are available on <a href=""http://www.vimeo.com/markcameronminard"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.vimeo.com/markcameronminard</a> and <a href=""http://www.movingessence.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.movingessence.net</a>.  This work was nominated for  Nursing Times award in 2014.  He films in cinematic quality.</p>
<p>Mark also has extensive skill and experience in therapeutic arts and health including movement, sound and imagery and sensory awareness.  He has worked with community groups of diverse ages and abilities. He has worked and trained with many experienced practitioners and researchers in these fields in UK, New Zealand and USA.</p>
<p>Mark is also trained and has worked as a scientist, design engineer and teacher.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bryony Rogers (Director and Producer)</p>
<p>Bryony trained at UCL and London Film-makers Co-op and worked in television research and production for several years.  She successfully ran Light Productions, a community and art film-making business, for six years, in Lancaster, UK.  This company produced twenty eight short documentary, fiction and dance films, and was awarded Film Council funding on three occasions.  Two of Bryony's personal films have been awarded prizes and commendation, at the VIVA Film Festival in London and the Vendome Film Festival.  She had to stop working because of ill health in 2006, but has started film-making again in recent years.  A couple of short documentaries she made recently are available on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/brightoceanstar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/user/brightoceanstar</a></p>Bryony is also a singer, poet and song-writer and leader of song ceremonies, and some of this work is available on <a href=""http://www.songofawakening.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.songofawakening.org.uk</a>.  She has twenty years experience of healing practice and is trained to Reiki 2.  Her training combined with her recent years of health experiences have brought a depth of knowledge, insight and skill in the holistic approach.<p> </p>
<p>These more holistic skills work together with our film skills to support our sensitivity in interviewing and filming people.  We are open to the subtleties of relationship between people and with Nature.  We can see this in the video in the filming of Maori Elder Eila Paul as she sings to the trees in the woods.  Eila is given space and time with which to express her experience of Nature responding to her, energetically, symbiotically, as she responds to it.  This enables the presence of this relationship and the power of Nature to be more readily experienced by the viewer.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>"" I am what you forced me to become!"" snarls Mordred.</p>
<p>King Arthur has ruled Dumnonia, the south-west peninsula of Britain, after being chosen as the Pendragon. His rise to prominence is remarkable, having defeated the Saxon sea-wolves at the Battle of Badon Hill at the age of sixteen. His elder sister, Morgan, once the Arch-Druidess of Dumnonia, is consumed with jealousy and plots against the throne. Following the deaths of Arthur's first wife, Anna, and his baby son, she is banished from Dumnonia.</p>
<p>Many years later, a young nobleman is found, poisoned, on the moors. Brought to the fort town Isca by Arthur's warriors, he is revealed to be Mordred, illegitimate son of King Arthur. He too has fallen victim of Morgan's plots. As father and son slowly gain each other's trust, Mordred, who is well liked by most of Arthur's followers, is eventually chosen as Regent of Dumnonia. This is a timely appointment of power as Arthur once more engages in battle, defending his kingdom against the Saxon invasion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all of Arthur's enemies are on the battlefield...</p>

<p>HOW YOUR HELP AFFECTS THE FILM &amp; THOSE INVOLVED </p>
<p>*""Mordred"" is mainly filmed, but requires some extra scenes that could not be completed at the time due to budget, and weather conditions. These scenes are critical to the narrative of the film, and without which the film cannot be completed. </p>
<p>* Your contributions allow us to gain access to a needed venue, cover costs of travel and food for cast and crew, without which the final scenes cannot be completed, and to assist with post production, editing costs - again if we cannot get the film edited then we cannot release the film that everyone has worked so hard on, and which so many lovely people have supported. </p>
<p>FUNDS ARE BEING RAISED FOR</p>
<p>* Additional scene location hire : £1,000</p>
<p>* Travel / food/ sundries for cast and crew for additional scenes: £1,600</p>
<p>* Post production general prices (editing, CG) £1,200</p>
<p>So far we have raised £150 towards this budget, so now, need to work hard for the rest.</p>
<p>We have a variety of exciting perks lined up for our lovely supporters. Among them there should be perks available for all budgets and tastes, and for those who can visit locally, as well as those further afield - you can view the full list in the list to your right. </p>
<p>In addition, all contributors will receive frequent news, images, and updates as to the progress of the project: before, during and after production. Contributors will also be invited to an exclusive team film premiere in South Devon when the film is complete. </p>
<p>With regards to any equipment or props purchased, these are obviously for the film, but will be retained after the project finishes, and used to create future projects, showcases, and training-in-use for local people, so that donations will have long term positive help as well.  </p>

<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>Some people have already asked us some valid questions about 'Mordred'. The Arthurian legend has been dramatised on screen many times before – how are we different?</p>
<p>Yes, the Arthurian legend has been dramatised many times, in many versions. However, we feel that what we have is unique in our source material and in our angle on the story. Whilst other films have explored the legends from the point of view of Morgan La Fay, Merlin, and Lancelot, no films have ever been produced - to our knowledge - that centre on Mordred. We have found some novels which explore the legends from Mordred's point of view, but even these are very different to what we are doing.</p>
<p>Most dramatisations of Arthurian legend depict Mordred (or a Mordred-like character) as a malevolent, evil character. In these treatments, he appears already evil, clearly insane or simply power-crazed. We prefer to trust some of the earliest known legends which actually speak well of Mordred's character, and pose the question 'What if Arthur and Mordred, fallible human beings, were pitted against one another by circumstance?'</p>
<p>The actual challenges are much more mundane.</p>
<p>Time constraints</p>
<p>We are of course making this film around our own day-jobs, so we have to liaise together to find windows of opportunity, when we can all take the time off to make this film. Luckily the ethic of teamwork and unity of purpose is high in our team, and we work hard to make these arrangements happen. </p>
<p>Equipment failure</p>
<p>Cameras, editing systems and external hard drives can all fail and cause serious issues. Once footage is filmed, it will be backed up to to two individual external drives</p>

<h3>My name is James H. Stevens. I am 58.   -AKA.420JIM</h3>
<p>In 2013 in Farmington NM I was set up, and charged with two counts of Marijuana.</p>
<p>I wanted to take it all the way to a jury trail. The State needed to prove what narcotic is in marijuana.  Instead of facing me in a trail the State found me Incompetent</p>
<p> to  stand trail and dropped the case. This to me is like calling me crazy!</p>
<p>So on March 1st of 2014 I ventured with my RV, and my dog and hit the road to show them just how crazy I was.</p>
<p>Over the last three years have traveled to 30 States.  Educating and also learning about the Cannabis/Hemp {AKA Marijuana plant} I held the first cannabis event ever done at Mount Rushmore in 2015. I held a pro--cannabis march in DC in 2016.</p>
<p>Also in 2016 I was invited to the 34th Vietnam veterans reunion near Kokomo IN. A whole lot of the vets asked for me to fight for them here in 2017 as well. I have two events to attend this year for the vets. in June, and one in Sept.</p>

<p>In the 1930s a lie was started by W.R.Herst he named the Cannabis /Hemp plant Marijuana to scare the U.S.A. for self gain.</p>
<p>I can not stand the fact that states sell a medical card for a class 1 narcotic.</p>
<p>I cant stand ripping off people making them buy a card! We do not sell a card for any kind of drug!  </p>

<p>Some might say what gives you the right to ask for help (what have you done }  In 2014 I sold everything I had but the dog and RV. I made up $5,000 and hit the road.

There I made $3,000 and put that in also. I have talked to tens of thousands of people, while doing petitions, and so on for over three years.

In 2013 in Farmington NM I was set up, and charged with two counts of Marijuana.
I wanted to take it all the way to a jury trail. The State needed to prove what narcotic is in marijuana.  Instead of facing me in a trail the State found me Incompetent
 to  stand trail and dropped the case. This to me is like calling me crazy!
So on March 1st of 2014 I ventured with my RV, and my dog and hit the road to show them just how crazy I was.
Over the last three years have traveled to 30 States.  Educating and also learning about the Cannabis/Hemp {AKA Marijuana plant} I held the first cannabis event ever done at Mount Rushmore in 2015. I held a pro--cannabis march in DC in 2016.
