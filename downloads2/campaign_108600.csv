Here's what we've done so far during the three weeks of the first leg of the tour out on the west coast!</p><p>We had the opportunity to <strong>connect and inspire over 8,000 students</strong>, <strong>ran a worldwide event</strong> to kickoff World Kindness week in over <strong>120 cities worldwide,</strong> distributed over <strong>2,500 Catching Kindness cards</strong>, engaged in <strong>hundreds of random acts of kindness</strong>, <strong>provided meals for the homeless</strong>, <strong>visited children’s hospitals</strong>: Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland and the Orthopaedic Institute for Children in LA, bringing gifts and love to the children there.</p><p>We need YOU to help fuel us forward! So my question to you is, has the work that I've done and Life Vest Inside has done inspired, touched or impacted you in any tiny way? If your answer is YES, then consider making a contribution - not because you have to, but because you WANT to! Because you WANT to know that you are part of all the change we are creating. At the end of the day, I can't force anyone to click the button, but I encourage you to realize that clicking that button is what keeps us afloat, keeps us creating the impact that inspired YOU! Kindness, like a boomerang always returns. So I ask you what can we do together in these next few hours to hit the goal?! Can we all make a commitment to give what we can?</p><p>For those just learning about Life Vest Inside, the proof is in the pudding! We have an amazing track record of success and want you to be a part of our continued success! </p><p><strong>Hope to add you to the list of Kindness Backers!</strong></p><p>______________________________________________</p><h3>To some the world is filled with war, hatred, violence and hopelessness. But together we have the power to fill this world with kindness, trust, hope and love. And so I’ll be heading out on a six week cross country kindness tour addressing the rift happening within our country. I’ll be leading talks, performing random acts of kindness and engaging everyday people and thought leaders around the importance of DIALOGUE; connecting with one another in spite of our differing beliefs. After all education is the greatest key to tolerance.</h3><h3> </h3><h3>If we want to truly change the culture of our country we need to begin having meaningful conversations. And so the theme of this tour is focused on listening and sharing. It’s not about everyone believing the same thing, but rather everyone respecting the beliefs of the other. “For all the violence to cease we must agree to disagree.”</h3><p> </p><h2><strong>Please consider contributing what you can to help us reach our $50,000 goal!</strong></h2><h3>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504131506/tkm5m5vxbyee2qvuul7y.jpg"" src=""""/>

SO WHAT DID WE DO?Why contribute? Here's what we've done so far during the three weeks of the first leg of the tour out on the west coast!We had the opportunity to connect and inspire over 8,000 students, ran a worldwide event to kickoff World Kindness week in over 120 cities worldwide, distributed over 2,500 Catching Kindness cards, engaged in hundreds of random acts of kindness, provided meals for the homeless, visited children’s hospitals: Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland and the Orthopaedic Institute for Children in LA, bringing gifts and love to the children there.We need YOU to help fuel us forward! So my question to you is, has the work that I've done and Life Vest Inside has done inspired, touched or impacted you in any tiny way? If your answer is YES, then consider making a contribution - not because you have to, but because you WANT to! Because you WANT to know that you are part of all the change we are creating. At the end of the day, I can't force anyone to click the button, but I encourage you to realize that clicking that button is what keeps us afloat, keeps us creating the impact that inspired YOU! Kindness, like a boomerang always returns. So I ask you what can we do together in these next few hours to hit the goal?! Can we all make a commitment to give what we can?For those just learning about Life Vest Inside, the proof is in the pudding! We have an amazing track record of success and want you to be a part of our continued success! Hope to add you to the list of Kindness Backers!______________________________________________To some the world is filled with war, hatred, violence and hopelessness. But together we have the power to fill this world with kindness, trust, hope and love. And so I’ll be heading out on a six week cross country kindness tour addressing the rift happening within our country. I’ll be leading talks, performing random acts of kindness and engaging everyday people and thought leaders around the importance of DIALOGUE; connecting with one another in spite of our differing beliefs. After all education is the greatest key to tolerance. If we want to truly change the culture of our country we need to begin having meaningful conversations. And so the theme of this tour is focused on listening and sharing. It’s not about everyone believing the same thing, but rather everyone respecting the beliefs of the other. “For all the violence to cease we must agree to disagree.” Please consider contributing what you can to help us reach our $50,000 goal!   
There’s one thing you need to know about me - I LOVE people with all my heart! Ever since childhood, I had a deep passion to unite people in a way like never before; to truly change the world. To help people see beyond the labels and connect with the heart of one another; recognizing that each person is in fact a piece of the same puzzle.I was a middle school teacher for 7 amazing years, the most transformative of my life! I left my job teaching back in September 2011 to start Life Vest Inside and pursue the dream of my four year old self who believed in her heart of hearts that she was destined to change the world. Life Vest Inside is a 501c3 non-profit organization with a mission to inspire, empower and educate people of all backgrounds to lead a life of kindness.Life Vest Inside gained international acclaim when our short film, Kindness Boomerang went viral, landing me a spot to speak at TED. I’m super touched and honored to have beenfeatured on: 
                                                       

 

This next journey is bound to be just as impactful but I need each of you to make it happen! Help me as I head out with my Kindness Caravan on a six week cross country tour around the USA, to spread the message of kindness and spur positive dialogue centered around increasing kindness perception within the US.
 

The more we connect and create a positive atmosphere to share varying ideas, the greater difference we can make in the world. In an effort to create greater, long lasting impact we will be producing a documentary chronicling the journey and sharing the stories of those we meet along the way.
 Traveling across the US is no simple thing and can be costly, especially when you’re traveling with 4! Contribute what you can to make this amazing Kindness Boomerang journey take flight!I know there is loads still ahead of me but I’m excited to see where my path will lead and I’m grateful to all those who have joined me for this extraordinary journey! Who knows, maybe the next goal is a Worldwide Tour! An extension of my initial journey into the wonderful world of kindness, this listening and sharing tour will not only serve to continue spreading awareness about the power of kindness, but it will also bring to light ways in which we aim to increase kindness perception within the US over the course of the next ten years. My goal is to use this tour as a means to spark conversation and positive dialogue with people of all backgrounds around the importance of kindness and how together we can make the US a kinder place to live and from there the world at large. I’ll be using my new book, Kindness Boomerang, to inspire, empower and equip those I meet along the journey with tools to make a change in their own life and within their community. So what will I be doing on the tour? Kind Talks: With a focus on schools and Universities, I will be giving talks in each city and distributing copies of Kindness Boomerang, as a practical guide to begin creating a lasting impact. In addition, Kindness Curriculum (K-5) will be distributed at each school. Goal: 4 talks in each city (Universities, Middle School, High School, Elementary School).Volunteer activities: Community members will be invited and encouraged to join me in local community based volunteer activities showing the importance of giving back within our own community. Goal: 1-2 volunteer activities/city. Activities can range from:
Providing (and serving!) special meals at shelters and soup kitchens
Dressing up and giving out loads of gifts and cheer to children at local children’s hospitals or orphanages
Cleaning up a local park
Visiting old age homes and hosting games of bingo
            Community activities: Meet up with me in your city and join in on some of my favorite hobbies - I have LOADS of them and I always love picking up new ones! From playing sports (basketball, softball, tennis, ping pong, ice skating, rollerblading), to starting a jam session (yes, I am a drummer!), to yoga, to movies or plays, to amusement parks, laser tag, soul-cycle, karaoke, etc... Let’s have some fun!
Community basketball game or any sport for that matter
Community Yoga Session
Community Jam Session
Community Bike Ride
Community Board Game Night
Soul-Cycle Charity Ride
  Random Acts of Kindness: Organized kindness is great but random kindness can have an extraordinary effect! Follow us on our journey as we complete our scavenger hunt list of acts of kindness to spread joy in loads of innovative ways to unsuspecting strangers throughout the journey! In each city I’ll be inviting community members to take part in fun kindness themed activities with me. In each city I’ll be inviting community members to take part in fun kindness themed activities with me. From Kindness Scavenger Hunts, to volunteering at soup kitchens, to playing bingo in nursing homes, to getting decked out in fun costumes and giving out free gifts and toys in hospitals, to giving out free hugs on the streets, to giving out free cups of coffee, to creating awesome chalk walks in your neighborhood, to giving meals to the homeless, to serenading strangers with some inspirational tunes, to throwing puppet shows for kids in local parks, to breaking out into flashmobs on your city streets, the list is endless!Have an idea?

Dance for Kindness serves as a means of building awareness for World Kindness Day (Nov 13th). Since DFK will take place during the tour, we will coordinating with groups in each city to create an event or take part in an existing event in their city! As for me, I’ll be in San Fran during Dance for Kindness dancing with our head choreographer, Justin Cole!Kindness Documentary and all things video: Follow the Kindness Caravan across the USA. In an effort to create greater, long lasting impact we will be producing a documentary chronicling the journey and sharing the stories of those we meet along the way.In addition to tracking me as I travel across the US through our interactive Map where you can see photo’s and videos, I’m going to be holding YouTubeLIVE, Facebook LIVE, and InstaLIVE streams every week!

<h2><strong>The Magick Ensues</strong></h2>
<p>Growing up in the Bronx has taught me one thing above many others: if you need something done, do it yourself and the rest will follow. This is expressed through our culture of survival, grit-based fashion, and the fact that we support each other from an unspoken bond of symbiosis. As a multidimensional creative and healer from the X, I've noticed copious patterns in how we relate to where we live. Very often our people are burdened with a feeling of lack because we see slums, poverty and political corruption before we see the rich magnitude of our native lands. When I created Crystals and Candy in 2015, it was a response to ""woke"" culture and constantly being told we would never have spaces for ourselves or access to healing because ""they"" didn't want us to. A year and 12 beautiful, bright events after, I'd helped build a community of amazing people who were interested in using astrology and meditation as tools to rebuild and heal themselves. I've had attendees cry in my arms and tell me a workshop helped them resolve internal turmoil, or that a crystal they received in my space protected them from harm. I met so many brilliant people, many who later became friends or clients. But something wasn't quite there yet.</p>
<p>My tarot patrons are mostly womyn of color. Most of them are artists, healers, and all of them are creators. The vast majority of them suffer from stagnation or blockage of the sacral chakra. As a patternfinder, training herbalist and shaman, I have no problem noting that these issues are rampant in womyn because of a lack of affirming, respect, and safety in expressing feminine energy.  This is also a strong symptom of disconnection from nature and the medicines that are available to transmute these pains. These blockages are the result of timeless suppression of the divine intuition and emotion within us, and when gone unacknowledged and neglected, can wreak havoc on mind body and soul.</p>
<p>Where does that end up? In the same place it can be solved: Community.</p>
<p>The Sweetness Circle was born of a need to create a space for womyn and gender non-conforming folks uptown, in places that are underfunded, underexposed, and underloved. It is a testament to the bright power of the divine feminine, and the need to give people access to that in a place that breeds it but rarely profits from it positively. The Bronx is the music capitol of the world, yet most of the healers and artists I know from here convene in spaces in Brooklyn and Manhattan for events. My borough is being blasted as a place of death or gentrification, but where does that leave the young people who are discovering their spiritual gifts in a space rife with pain? Where do kids who don't have the language to understand their identity or ancestral connection go? What space is there for the teens of the seas and the womyn of the waters to convene, decompress, co-create, and build resources for expansion?</p>
<p>There is a widespread need in the Bronx for physical space that is safe, accessible, and offers emotional and spiritual nourishment. We need access to spaces that offer us the deep, visceral healing our people have been denied for centuries and we need it now: we deserve it. We need spaces that allow us to do so without the constant chatter of lack, of political burnout, and anger-based building. We need spaces that allow us to rewrite narratives for ourselves and future generations. We deserve to use the instruments of joy and personal power to thrive.</p>
<p>It is here. And you can help.</p>
<p>These monthly events will include healing and informational workshops, features from incredible artists, musicians and crafters, and music to groove to: all by womyn of color and GNC folks. The workshops will mostly be womyn/GNC exclusive, with specific workshops open to non-womyn. Many workshops will focus on creating connections with our spiritual roots as POC, connecting with nature, and building deep bonds that can last lifetimes. Overall this space is tailored to help people of color build connections, resources, and develop their own medicine in their backyard. The Sweetness Circle is an anchor of love, creativity, and awareness based in the Uptown NYC area, but is open to folks from all boroughs.</p>
<p>Because I am a healer, I acknowledge the need for people to be compensated for their work. Your donations will provide stipends for facilitators, materials for workshops and artists, and spaces for the magick to happen in. These donations will go to things like journals, crystals and herbs, and various goodies for take-home magick. They will go to providing decorations for vendors who want to deck out their displays, nails and tape for artists who share their hearts with you on walls and in action. They will go into the pockets of the dope ass folks who DJ the tunes that play when you meet your new best friend. They will go into the minds of all of this generation's newest powerboxes, and inevitably, into healing their bloodlines and descendants. Your support of these beautiful beings will go into buying trash bags that will be filled with garbage from rivers as we walk and learn about the magick that is Oshun. It will go into the plants that will surround us as we learn of the medicine of the divine feminine, and how powerful it can be to be kind.</p>
<p>Play a role in the ending of a narrative of disempowerment. Play a role in someone learning about the musicbox inside themselves after a workshop blows out cobwebs. Come out and break some barriers.</p>
<p>De-colonize self. Re-engage joy.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Elizabeth Stewart, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in San Jose, CA and Founder/President of Kingdom Family Resources, a Community based Mental Health Service. From 1990 to 2012 I worked within Silicon Valley's  Santa Clara County as well as in Tulsa Ok, providing Mental Health support and facilitating in home services to kids and families involved in the Juvenile Justice System, Department of Children and Family Services, County Mental Health Services, Drug Rehabilitation services, and Psychiatric Hospital Services. What I found to be most effective is helping families in the environment they are struggling in vs. a child coming to the office for therapy and then returning home back to the same way of family functioning. How can a child work at changing his behavior if the environment has no change? This is why doing therapy with the <strong>Family </strong>in the environment is more effective and sustainable than a child coming to the office for therapy.  Often the child would be identified as the problem vs. the problem being the problem, thus pushing the child and family further into a hole that seemed to have no hope. In 2012 Kingdom Family Resources was incorporated with our vision of<strong> <u>""Restore a heart, Restore a family, Transform lives for a lifetime"". </u></strong> We are here to help families look at the problem that is infecting the family and focus on treating the infection instead of labeling the person. This campaign is vital to helping families receive this level of support together in a safe environment that will provide education, skill building, resources, and fun. Most families that are in crisis or striving to have a sense of wellness often are not able to experience healing and peace because their approach to addressing the problem is not working.  We need to help families learn how to address the ""infection"" in a way that decreases stress, brings relief, and allows the family to hope again. Your support will provide opportunities for families to come  away from this camp with a renewed strength and hope, and we need your support to make this happen!  This is a rare occasion where a family can receive this level of support together for a weekend -<strong>guaranteed to change the life of a family.</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Carlstad Crusaders is an American Football Club in Karlstad, Sweden. We are one of the top American Football Clubs in Europe and the top team in Sweden. We have eight teams in different leagues from PeeWee to adult, men and women teams. </p>
<p>We have produced players to top Div I college teams in USA as well as NFL and NFL Europe when it was played. </p>
<p>Carlstad Crusaders were founded in 1991 and are currently planning to take the next step for our organization. We will create an American Football Sport Center dedicated to American Football to be a base for the sports development in the northern Europe.</p>
<p>Today the teams in our club practices at different facilities making transportation of equipment problematic. Where our youth and ladies teams practice we lack dressing rooms and showers. We have no light at the field so we can not practice late in the spring and the fall. There are no rooms for our coaches and staff to work, break down film and have meetings. </p>
<p>These facilities will help us build an American Football program where the youth and elite players can grow and be better, and our club can excel in all areas.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently we have secured 2/3 of the fundings to build our new Sports Center and we are now reaching out to help us finalize the cost for this project. Our goal is to raise the last 1.000.000 USD that is needed to start the project. Even if we don´t reach our goal, all contributions are welcome and we will create the best Sport Center as we can with our available fundings. </p>
<p>The fundings that are secured so far are from the municipal of Karlstad, foundations in Sweden and sponsors. </p>
<p>In Karlstad a new sports area, Sannafältet, will be built with enough space for three sport arenas. Carlstad Crusaders have the opportunity to create a complete top class Sports Center dedicated to American football with modern training and meeting facilities as well as an heated artificial turf field with lights and stands.</p>
<p>The facility will be 16.000 square feet large, with areas to pursue all club activities, all year around and will have: <br/>- Social areas with a cafe. A natural meeting place to discuss American football over a cup of coffee, dine, have football nights etc.<br/>- Office space where the clubs’ administrative staff and coaches can work during the day and evenings.<br/>- A large area will be dedicated for physical exercise, with a gym and tracks where all the members of the club can conduct training in a professional environment.<br/>- Classrooms for meetings of up to 80 people, board meetings, tactical reviews and lectures.<br/>- Four large locker rooms with space for 45 players in each locker room.<br/><br/>The facility is within walking distance of Karlstad city centre in an attractive natural setting where it is easy to get to and from. A facility with the best conditions for the club to pursue continued success even in the future.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Carlstad Crusaders is an American Football Club in Karlstad, Sweden. We are one of the top American Football Clubs in Europe and the top team in Sweden. We have eight teams in different leagues from PeeWee to adult, men and women teams. 
We have produced players to top Div I college teams in USA as well as NFL and NFL Europe when it was played. 
Carlstad Crusaders were founded in 1991 and are currently planning to take the next step for our organization. We will create an American Football Sport Center dedicated to American Football to be a base for the sports development in the northern Europe.
Today the teams in our club practices at different facilities making transportation of equipment problematic. Where our youth and ladies teams practice we lack dressing rooms and showers. We have no light at the field so we can not practice late in the spring and the fall. There are no rooms for our coaches and staff to work, break down film and have meetings. 
These facilities will help us build an American Football program where the youth and elite players can grow and be better, and our club can excel in all areas.

What We Need & What You Get
Currently we have secured 2/3 of the fundings to build our new Sports Center and we are now reaching out to help us finalize the cost for this project. Our goal is to raise the last 1.000.000 USD that is needed to start the project. Even if we don´t reach our goal, all contributions are welcome and we will create the best Sport Center as we can with our available fundings. 
The fundings that are secured so far are from the municipal of Karlstad, foundations in Sweden and sponsors. 
In Karlstad a new sports area, Sannafältet, will be built with enough space for three sport arenas. Carlstad Crusaders have the opportunity to create a complete top class Sports Center dedicated to American football with modern training and meeting facilities as well as an heated artificial turf field with lights and stands.
The facility will be 16.000 square feet large, with areas to pursue all club activities, all year around and will have: - Social areas with a cafe. A natural meeting place to discuss American football over a cup of coffee, dine, have football nights etc.- Office space where the clubs’ administrative staff and coaches can work during the day and evenings.- A large area will be dedicated for physical exercise, with a gym and tracks where all the members of the club can conduct training in a professional environment.- Classrooms for meetings of up to 80 people, board meetings, tactical reviews and lectures.- Four large locker rooms with space for 45 players in each locker room.The facility is within walking distance of Karlstad city centre in an attractive natural setting where it is easy to get to and from. A facility with the best conditions for the club to pursue continued success even in the future.

The Impact
One of the things that distinguishes Carlstad Crusaders is the focus on our core values. Joy and fellowship, democracy and participation, the right of everyone to be involved and, most importantly, fair play. These core values permeate the entire club, from the PeeWee teams all the way to the women and men's teams.
What makes Carlstad Crusaders special is that we will take care of everyone who comes here, we not only work with those who are skilled. We take care of everyone, regardless of experience, and teach them American football so that the individual can reach the full potential and have the best and most positive experience they can get.
When you become part of this club, you become not just part of a team or an age group. You become part of something bigger. You become part of a family, you become part of something big, not just one part.
Now, almost thirty years after the first crusade, Carlstad Crusaders prepare for new achievements. In order for this Sports Center to become a reality, we need your help.

Risks & Challenges
We have been working with this project for three years and we know that there are several problems that may occur on the journey before this Sport Center is a reality. We have staffed our project team with competent and experienced persons to help us achieve our goal. 
There are risks and challenges that lays ahead, but with secure funding we believe that we are well suited for what ever may cross our path of creating the platform for our club to take the next step toward greatness. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can´t contribute financially, help us spread the word by sharing your knowledge about this project. Or help us get in contact with persons, foundations or others that can help us.
We are also looking for sponsors that can help us with furniture, equipment or other helpful things for our club to grow and give youth and adult players the opportunity to try American Football.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

needs of women who suffer from breast-related health issues.  These beautiful garments are important whether the patient is recovering from <b>ANY BREAST SURGERY</b>, including <b>breast augmentation, breast enhancement, breast reconstruction or mastectomy</b>. We create innovative contouring and supportive

<p align=""left""></p>
<p align=""left"">The company was started in 2013 by Janice
Trane Jones. After having personally experienced
the challenges of post-operative breast care, both with her own surgery and with that of her mother and her mother-in-law, Janice found
surprisingly few options for women’s garments enabling recovery. <br/></p>
<p align=""left"">She found that the available solutions amounted to nothing more than sports bras that were woefully inadequate to meet the special needs a woman has as she struggles with the discomfort and emotional trauma of post-surgical healing.  She found that virtually every woman who had undergone breast surgery was extremely unhappy and dissatisfied with the bras the hospitals had sent them home with.  <br/></p>
<p align=""left"">Deeply committed to finding a solution, she decided to apply her some 25 years management experience, creativity and sewing
skills and try and create a prototype bra that could be adjusted to conform as
a woman would need it to be and the first product was born. That first prototype evolved over 20 months to the amazing comfort and support bra now ready to go out to the women of the world.  It features a
completely new and innovative way of addressing breast healing and contouring
in a bra which allows multiple adjustments to fit exactly to an individual woman's needs.  Additionally, the adjustments can be changed as healing progresses and needs change.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<h4 style=""color:#2e9582;""><strong>Origin story</strong></h4>
<p>Lunch Break started taking shape after a particularly stressful morning at my day job. You know, the kind of morning with back-to-back meetings and dozens of e-mails each with their own manufactured emergency. By the time lunch rolled around, I was exhausted and dreaming of a siesta — <a href=""https://www.tripsavvy.com/why-do-you-sleep-during-siesta-1644327"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sadly, a fading tradition</a> — or a great mid-day meal <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/bbcmoney/videos/754730661372376/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">like they enjoy in France</a>. Instead, I ate chips out of a vending machine and spent 30 minutes scrolling through Instagram. I knew I was eating garbage and wasting my time, but I just didn't have the energy to come up with anything better. So, there I sat. <br/><br/>Later that night, I found myself down a rabbit hole reading about <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/how-successful-people-spend-their-lunch-break-2016-9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">how successful people spend their lunch breaks</a> connecting, moving, reading, and eating well. I hated that I was often doing the exact opposite. Quickly, though, I realized that a year's worth of lunch breaks amounted to about 250 hours worth of time that could be spent living intentionally and actively working toward self-improvement. I just had to take advantage of the opportunity.<br/><br/>I decided to make a change, but I was missing the community and inspiration I knew I'd need to achieve results. So, I created Lunch Break to help myself and help others make lunch time more meaningful.

<p>We live in a society that is <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/social-media-anxiety-disorder"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">over stimulated</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity_in_the_United_States"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">over weight</a>, and <a href=""https://20somethingfinance.com/american-hours-worked-productivity-vacation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">over worked</a>. We're not so good at taking care of ourselves, and when we do talk about self-care it's usually in the context of a glass of wine and a face mask after work.

<p>As an Adaptive Physical Educator, and Director of Easter Seals
Community Based Programs for 18+ years, Cameron attuned her skills and her
passion for seeing the potential of clients being in warm water.  Spanning from mild Arthritis, minor surgeries
to major special needs such as Cerebral Palsy, amputation, Stroke and
Parkinson’s.  </p>
<p>“Seeing the postures and pain of clients that come in with
intense pain and movement issues, then their faces and even smiles as they
leave, has been my biggest teacher and inspiration.“<br/></p>
<h4>Special Needs</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/766396/files/20140804160131-lift.webp?1407193291"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This
campaign is to raise money for an Aquatic Lift so we who work at the AquaZen
Center can service our Special Needs client’s in safety and with ease of entry and exit from our pool
environment. </p>
<p>At
this time our 13 X 17 foot above ground pool is located in an area where there
is some degree of difficulty walking down to the pool, from where a car is parked.  Once on the deck entry into the pool is steep
for anyone suffering from any problems with knees, hips or back.</p>
<p>The Aquazen Center, besides the day to day services we provide clients,  are committed to a once a month Free Clinic, that services any one who has financial or physical needs. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another one
of our projects here at the Aquatic Integration Institute is to work with the
Wounded Warrior’s, men and woman returning from the war with Post Tramatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD).  The lift will enable
those who have difficulty in walking a safe way to enter and exit the pool.</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Our goal in
purchasing the lift will be to provide safety and have a broader ability to
service a larger population of clients needing Aquatic Therapy</b>.</blockquote>
<p><b>Your
contribution</b> will help us to achieve this goal, and be a service to the many
who will now be able to receive aquatic therapy.  </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h4>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h4> <p></p>
<p>The Aquatic
Integration Institute is a privately funded and owned entity.  It’s daily costs and pool maintenance are
privately paid for, its revenue earned is minimal.</p>
<p><b>So that we can purchase the
Aquatic Lift we are asking for help. </b></p>
<p>We need
$5,000 to purchase and install an aquatic lift.  Our goal is simple in that all the $ raised
will go directly for the lift, if the $5,000 is not raised whatever $ is still
needed to complete the purchase the Institute will cover the balance.  </p>
<p>All monies
that are gifted are tax deductible and so a receipt will be sent to everyone
participating in the fundraiser. </p>
</div> <div> <h4>The Impact</h4> <p></p>
<p>The impact
that this lift will give to our Central Coast Community (especially North
County) will be both large and significantly small.  </p>
<p>The Institutes
purpose is to provide Aquatic Therapy to all peoples.  Those that can afford the therapy and to
those who cannot..  So your contribution
will be felt on the larger scale by the population of people who cannot get
services either because of finances and or because of physical restrictions.</p>
<p>And on a
smaller scale to those who can afford treatment but need a safe and easier
access getting into the pool.  </p>
<p>Please think
about all the people you know, friends and family members that you would like
to invite to a pool, and know that your contribution will make this easier for
those that may have not been able to attend due to safe access. </p>
</div> <div> <h4>Risks &amp; Challenges</h4> <p> </p>
<p>The risk to
this fundraiser is non- existent.  This
is not a money-making proposal, this is a service oriented project.  The only challenges and risks so far have
been that clients who come to the pool have had to walk down quite a ways from
their car to the pool over terrain that compromises someone who has balance and
coordination issues.  This fundraisers
goal is to create a better risk, challenge free environment for access. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div><p>We so
appreciate every one of you that has gotten this far in reading our
proposal.  Please know that you can help
as well even if money is not what your able to give now.  If you can send on this invitation to anyone
you know or can think of that may know someone that may know someone.  Please spread the word.  The more the word spreads, the more likely we
will be able to install a lift to service those with special needs. </p>
<p>You can go
to the indiegogo share tools and easily send our invite out to as many people
as you wish.  </p>

Wounded Warrior’s, men and woman returning from the war with Post Tramatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD).  The lift will enable
those who have difficulty in walking a safe way to enter and exit the pool.

Our goal in
purchasing the lift will be to provide safety and have a broader ability to
service a larger population of clients needing Aquatic Therapy.
Your
contribution will help us to achieve this goal, and be a service to the many
who will now be able to receive aquatic therapy.  

  What We Need & What You Get 
The Aquatic
Integration Institute is a privately funded and owned entity.  It’s daily costs and pool maintenance are
privately paid for, its revenue earned is minimal.
So that we can purchase the
Aquatic Lift we are asking for help. 
We need
$5,000 to purchase and install an aquatic lift.  Our goal is simple in that all the $ raised
will go directly for the lift, if the $5,000 is not raised whatever $ is still
needed to complete the purchase the Institute will cover the balance.  
All monies
that are gifted are tax deductible and so a receipt will be sent to everyone
participating in the fundraiser. 
  The Impact 
The impact
that this lift will give to our Central Coast Community (especially North
County) will be both large and significantly small.  
The Institutes
purpose is to provide Aquatic Therapy to all peoples.  Those that can afford the therapy and to
those who cannot..  So your contribution
will be felt on the larger scale by the population of people who cannot get
services either because of finances and or because of physical restrictions.
And on a
smaller scale to those who can afford treatment but need a safe and easier
access getting into the pool.  
Please think
about all the people you know, friends and family members that you would like
to invite to a pool, and know that your contribution will make this easier for
those that may have not been able to attend due to safe access. 
  Risks & Challenges  
The risk to
this fundraiser is non- existent.  This
is not a money-making proposal, this is a service oriented project.  The only challenges and risks so far have
been that clients who come to the pool have had to walk down quite a ways from
their car to the pool over terrain that compromises someone who has balance and
coordination issues.  This fundraisers
goal is to create a better risk, challenge free environment for access. 
  Other Ways You Can Help 
We so
appreciate every one of you that has gotten this far in reading our
proposal.  Please know that you can help
as well even if money is not what your able to give now.  If you can send on this invitation to anyone
you know or can think of that may know someone that may know someone.  Please spread the word.  The more the word spreads, the more likely we
will be able to install a lift to service those with special needs. 
You can go
to the indiegogo share tools and easily send our invite out to as many people
as you wish.

Leigh's creative campaigns through <a href=""https://www.feelyourboobies.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Feel Your Boobies®</a> have saved countless lives, but now she's taken her mission one step further--to help women navigate the steps that come after a diagnosis. </p>
<p> For the first time ever, in her debut book <a href=""https://leighhurst.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SAY SOMETHING BIG</a>, Leigh walks through her own breast cancer journey with advice and stories from five other survivors she met directly through Feel Your Boobies®. From processing the moment of diagnoses to celebrating cancer-versaries, Leigh provides insight and tips on what newly diagnosed women of any age can expect along the way and how these five women made big changes and decided to Say Something Big after finding their little lumps.</p>
<p>Sprinkled with inspiration and a bit of humor, Say Something Big is a Breast Cancer Support Group in a book: small enough to carry with you to those important appointments yet packed with encouragement to help make your voice louder than it ever was.</p>

<p>We women struggle  with the issue of no pockets in our clothing.   So we all use our bras as a pocket because, we
wear one with every outfit and, we need to carry things discreetly.  This was a problem of convenience only, until
we all started needing our phones on us at all times.  Carrying a cell phone in a bra only creates
another problem, which is the potential danger of having an electronic device
close to our bodies.  Both the Radio
Frequencies and the heat from a phone are major concerns.  </p>
<p><i><b>Does a cell phone in a
bra cause breast cancer?  Does it
not?  </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>We worry the answer may

<p>Sadly,
research has NEVER been done to provide evidence, but, it is a huge debate in
the media and medical worlds right now. 
In the meantime, The Bra-ket solves both the problem of convenience AND
safety.</p>
<p>Your first
reaction to “The Bra-ket” may be to laugh a little bit.  We are NOT offended!  In fact, the idea of The Bra-ket started from
friends making fun of me for always carrying my phone in my bra and calling it
my bra-ket.   </p>
<p>Behind all
the jokes though, I was secretly terrified that using my bra as a pocket for my
phone was dangerous!  Like many of you, my life has been personally affected by breast cancer as my mom is a survivor.   Actually, I don’t know a woman who isn’t
scared of this disease and, I see women every day who have their phones in their
bras.  Even at my last mammogram, the
nurse praised The Bra-ket because she sees women using their bras to carry phones
all the time.</p>
<p>I was inspired by the EMF protection devices used by the military and I thought  “There must be a way to provide safety while
allowing a phone signal”.   Now,

Global advertising and distribution


Mass production to bring manufacturing costs down


Continued research and development to gain traction and stay ahead of competition

Offer a wider variety of colors and design options in a timely manner
Packaging for efficient display and shipping
Risks and challenges:If we don't meet our goal, we will continue to manufacture and distribute The Bra-kets to the best of our financial ability.  We feel  committed to The Bra-ket movement and believe it is important there be availability of The Bra-ket  for all women who ""tuck and stash""  in their bra.Can't contribute now?Even if you can't contribute now, please use the Indiegogo sharebuttons and help us spread our Bra-ket movement message.  Imagine the peace of mind you can share.  Thank you sincerely, Your Breast Friends at The Bra-ket!",12.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Luz Adriana Cobos, Colombian and Swiss citizen. I studied Computer science engineering in Colombia and a MBA (specialized in Entrepreneurship and Business development) in Switzerland. I lived in Geneva, Switzerland where I worked with the United Nations System.</p>
<p>For the longest time I felt I was not living  my life of purpose and in 2010 I decided to start a new chapter in my life. Then I became a yoga teacher, studied nutrition and alternative therapies. In 2017 I packed everything and came back to Colombia for good (after living 21 years in Europe) with the project of building a Center for yoga and human development: Akashaja. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533334058/pc7cryjnghum5pzjmld7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>*View of the project when finished</i></p>
<p>The campaign <strong><i>""Help opening doors with Akashaja""</i></strong> it is a project from the heart. I feel many people in Colombia (as it is around the world) want to go back to their roots and  to the important and  simple things of life.  Akashaja wants to offer courses and workshops with subjects related to human development having as a main axe Yoga, meditation, vegan food and nature. I believe the center has the potential to show undiscovered doors (talents, intentions, possibilities) and to help people to INvolve and re-connect to their true self, convictions, dreams, ideas and life purpose.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533334995/urffupeexkmbneoujfjm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>*Main Building (400 sqm)</i></p>
<p>Akashaja won´t be a hotel and will be opened for courses and workshops according to a specific calendar. In order to be able to create a financial stability we need to have ready the occupancy for 30 people. </p>
<p>Although I collected all my savings and my pension fund to build this dream, these resources will cover only 2/3 of the project.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533336675/zoaaupofnwoyikanzoic.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The crowdfunding will provide  1/3 of the total financial resources we need to cover the construction of  lodges for part of the guests,  the main yoga practice room and two pedestrian paths to go uphill. This will  allow us to be operational from the beginning. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your contribution we will build everything in guadua (bamboo´s big thicker sister), green roofs, wood walls, solar electricity, dry toilettes, bamboo opened sky showers. In our compromise to be socially responsible we will keep using Colombian Guadua, national materials as much as possible; employing independent specialized Colombian Guadua constructors and wood artisans, local workers and  respecting Mother nature in the whole process. Your contribution can help us to maintain the Spirit of sustainability and ecology that guides this project from its very start point. </p>
<p>You can see a breakdown table of the fees covered with the crowdfunding: </p>

<h3><strong>Perks</strong></h3>
<p>Akashaja is about experiences, learning, sharing, having fun, meeting new people and so are our perks.</p>
<p><u><i><strong>Our perks  are about  percentage of discounts that you can claim for one of our courses.</strong></i></u>  Perks can be claimed when we start functionning (we expect to open 60% of the occupancy by January 2019).</p>
<p>We are a services organisation and we are looking forward to having you in one of our courses and thank you for your support.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533329207/dtsn016i022gqtvnr9jz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>*</strong><u> Courses subjects</u>: yoga, massage, bioconstruction, permaculture, taichi yan, taichi zhen, qigong, selfdefense, herbs, essential oils, handcraft, astrology, pendulums, energy therapies, amerindian tradicional culture and more.</p>
<p>Once we open the center you will have a variety of theme courses and you will have the possibility to<i><strong> claim the perk (discount) on ""the one course "" that catch your eye and your heart</strong></i>. It is not only about the discounts but the possibility to visit the beautiful region we are located. </p>
<p><strong>If we don't reach the goal</strong></p>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, we will use the collected funds to build as much as we can with them. Banks interest in  Colombia are extremely high and we will prefer to go as far as we can with the collected funds rather than contracting an expensive credit. We will wait until we have more money to finish the construction in the scenario of being short on financial resources</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Akashaja can contribute to the Colombian dreamed peace after decades and generations of internal conflict. How come? Yes, because many of us understood that peace can' t be signed and declared, we understood that it solely relies as an individual choice, conviction, intention and willingness to be discovered and lived.</p>
<p>In our 30.000 sqm we produce only organic fruits (different kind of mangos, oranges, lemons, mandarines, cacao, avocado, guanabana, banana, lulo and more) and we will have our own organic vegetables and herbs. In the near future we will produce organic essential oils and we will teach people how to use them. We have many other native trees that are used for medicine and health purposes, and others that silently mantain the ecological equilibrium, and we want to bring this knowledge back to people's life. </p>
<p>Akashaja's vision is to help people to regain their power and retake responsibility over their health and life. We want to accompany them in their process, show them possibilities and teach them tools to balance their physical, spiritual and intellectual life: we are spiritual beings having a human experience and we are here for a purpose.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since 2/3 of the project are financially covered, we don't have debts and we have already constructed the main building, I will say there are more challenges than risks. Yet, risks are related to not making enough money to keep the place running in the long term, bad weather that will force us to cancel courses or workshops.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533334499/ugjnvcargos18pp0wedk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our main challenges will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>To accommodate a minimum of participants to reach an even point and be able to pay our staff, services, logistics and bills. </li>
<li>Create workshops, courses, music concerts and expositions that will fulfill people' s expectations.</li>
</ol>
<p>To overcome the challenges, a connected team with good deep intentions, ideas and harmonized energies will materialized this spirit. We are working with yoga teachers, taichi instructors, vegan chefs, local farmers, crafts(wo)men, traditional healers to create coherent and fun programs to be offered. We are ready to listen to people's ideas and suggestions.</p>

<h3>Thanks for your help! </h3>
</div></div>","Short Summary
I am Luz Adriana Cobos, Colombian and Swiss citizen. I studied Computer science engineering in Colombia and a MBA (specialized in Entrepreneurship and Business development) in Switzerland. I lived in Geneva, Switzerland where I worked with the United Nations System.
For the longest time I felt I was not living  my life of purpose and in 2010 I decided to start a new chapter in my life. Then I became a yoga teacher, studied nutrition and alternative therapies. In 2017 I packed everything and came back to Colombia for good (after living 21 years in Europe) with the project of building a Center for yoga and human development: Akashaja. 

*View of the project when finished
The campaign ""Help opening doors with Akashaja"" it is a project from the heart. I feel many people in Colombia (as it is around the world) want to go back to their roots and  to the important and  simple things of life.  Akashaja wants to offer courses and workshops with subjects related to human development having as a main axe Yoga, meditation, vegan food and nature. I believe the center has the potential to show undiscovered doors (talents, intentions, possibilities) and to help people to INvolve and re-connect to their true self, convictions, dreams, ideas and life purpose.

*Main Building (400 sqm)
Akashaja won´t be a hotel and will be opened for courses and workshops according to a specific calendar. In order to be able to create a financial stability we need to have ready the occupancy for 30 people. 
Although I collected all my savings and my pension fund to build this dream, these resources will cover only 2/3 of the project.

The crowdfunding will provide  1/3 of the total financial resources we need to cover the construction of  lodges for part of the guests,  the main yoga practice room and two pedestrian paths to go uphill. This will  allow us to be operational from the beginning.

What We Need & What You Get
With your contribution we will build everything in guadua (bamboo´s big thicker sister), green roofs, wood walls, solar electricity, dry toilettes, bamboo opened sky showers. In our compromise to be socially responsible we will keep using Colombian Guadua, national materials as much as possible; employing independent specialized Colombian Guadua constructors and wood artisans, local workers and  respecting Mother nature in the whole process. Your contribution can help us to maintain the Spirit of sustainability and ecology that guides this project from its very start point. 
You can see a breakdown table of the fees covered with the crowdfunding: 

Perks
Akashaja is about experiences, learning, sharing, having fun, meeting new people and so are our perks.
Our perks  are about  percentage of discounts that you can claim for one of our courses.  Perks can be claimed when we start functionning (we expect to open 60% of the occupancy by January 2019).
We are a services organisation and we are looking forward to having you in one of our courses and thank you for your support.

* Courses subjects: yoga, massage, bioconstruction, permaculture, taichi yan, taichi zhen, qigong, selfdefense, herbs, essential oils, handcraft, astrology, pendulums, energy therapies, amerindian tradicional culture and more.
Once we open the center you will have a variety of theme courses and you will have the possibility to claim the perk (discount) on ""the one course "" that catch your eye and your heart. It is not only about the discounts but the possibility to visit the beautiful region we are located. 
If we don't reach the goal
If we don't reach the goal, we will use the collected funds to build as much as we can with them. Banks interest in  Colombia are extremely high and we will prefer to go as far as we can with the collected funds rather than contracting an expensive credit. We will wait until we have more money to finish the construction in the scenario of being short on financial resources

The Impact
Akashaja can contribute to the Colombian dreamed peace after decades and generations of internal conflict. How come? Yes, because many of us understood that peace can' t be signed and declared, we understood that it solely relies as an individual choice, conviction, intention and willingness to be discovered and lived.
In our 30.000 sqm we produce only organic fruits (different kind of mangos, oranges, lemons, mandarines, cacao, avocado, guanabana, banana, lulo and more) and we will have our own organic vegetables and herbs. In the near future we will produce organic essential oils and we will teach people how to use them. We have many other native trees that are used for medicine and health purposes, and others that silently mantain the ecological equilibrium, and we want to bring this knowledge back to people's life. 
Akashaja's vision is to help people to regain their power and retake responsibility over their health and life. We want to accompany them in their process, show them possibilities and teach them tools to balance their physical, spiritual and intellectual life: we are spiritual beings having a human experience and we are here for a purpose.

Risks & Challenges
Since 2/3 of the project are financially covered, we don't have debts and we have already constructed the main building, I will say there are more challenges than risks. Yet, risks are related to not making enough money to keep the place running in the long term, bad weather that will force us to cancel courses or workshops.

Our main challenges will be:

To accommodate a minimum of participants to reach an even point and be able to pay our staff, services, logistics and bills. 
Create workshops, courses, music concerts and expositions that will fulfill people' s expectations.

To overcome the challenges, a connected team with good deep intentions, ideas and harmonized energies will materialized this spirit. We are working with yoga teachers, taichi instructors, vegan chefs, local farmers, crafts(wo)men, traditional healers to create coherent and fun programs to be offered. We are ready to listen to people's ideas and suggestions.

<p>Greetings Community!</p>
<p>This story began 5 years ago when I completed my 3-year training in Herbal Medicine.</p>
<p>Living in Oakland, I was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed about attending my first herbal symposium, then in existence for 23 years, just 3 plus hours north of where I lived.</p>
<p>I’ll admit- it had its merits. However, I was disappointed. Disappointed to be one of only two African American women in attendance out of some 300 participants. Not to mention, very few other faces of color, including the teaching staff, graced my presence-- from what my naked eyes could see and fine-tuned ears could hear.</p>
<p>Disappointment was an understatement. Not because containers such as those are unfamiliar, but rather, the under-representation of cultures with people of color in this vast world of ancient plant medicine and healing ways was so prevalent. Where were we?</p>
<p>My name is Tanya Henderson and I’ve been working as a practitioner in the field of Holistic Health &amp; Natural Healing since 2006.</p>
<p>I founded the <strong><i>Women of Color Herbal &amp; Healing Retreat (WOCHHR)</i> </strong>nearly a year ago in efforts to inspire a healing environment that centers women of color seeking to reclaim the ancient ways of our ancestors and bathe in self-care practices connected to plant medicine and healing rituals. Prior to this, in 2015, I co-founded the late <i>California Women of Color Herbal Symposium</i>- a prime example of these needed spaces for Women of Color. However, the more sustainable they are- the better we fare!</p>
<p>This October is our 1st <i>WOCHH</i> <i>Retreat </i>, welcoming women of color from all lineages and ages to gather in celebration and healing. It is a place for grandmothers, mothers, daughters and granddaughters to have an inter-generational experience rooted in ancient wisdom. This precious and necessary space invites a deep awakening, embodiment, connection and inspiration through plant medicine teachings, indigenous life skills, womb wellness, nourishing meals and sisterhood. It is a homecoming and opportunity to teach, learn, rest, rejuvenate and commune with and on sacred land.</p>
<p><strong>The <i>WOCHH Retreat</i> hopes to inspire:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A deeper connection to the plants &amp; their medicines</li>
<li>An awakening and reclaiming of ancestral lineage and ancient medicine ways</li>
<li>Embodiment of self-care practices and healing from the inside out</li>
<li>Self &amp; community empowerment</li>
<li>Cultivation of a strong sisterhood and healing community</li>

<p><strong>We really need your help!</strong></p>
<p>We are looking to raise $15,000 and believe that it IS possible with the help of community!</p>
<p>We recognize that we are holding something truly sacred in the palm of our hands- a radical healing movement ready to be born. We are working as diligently as possible in the deep alchemy stages of creating something from nothing. This is part of the magic and medicine we carry as peoples of color, and yet, we are trying hard to break the cycle of giving to the point of depletion and debt, as many of our ancestors were either not paid fair wages or at all for their labor.</p>
<p>As we bloom from survival mode into a thriving space of existence with your help, our intention is to bring this healing work forward into our community and beyond in a way that is sustainable from the inside out. We intend for this abundance to ripple forward to future generations who will, in turn, carry forth this sacred work.  All of this, however, requires a strong financial foundation.</p>
<p>We anticipate anywhere from 60 to 80 women and girls to be in attendance at the <i>Retreat</i>. And while the desire is high, the funds are low and intimidating for some potential participants who live paycheck to paycheck. We would like that no one be turned away for lack of funds.</p>
<p>While registration fees will cover much of the venue cost, there are external expenses that cannot be met without this funding.</p>
<p><strong>Your donation will help us to cover:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Educational &amp; printing costs</li>
<li>Teacher compensation</li>
<li>Scholarships</li>
<li>Class supplies</li>
<li>Administration costs</li>
<li>Seed funding to reserve next year's venue</li>
</ul>
<p>Your contribution will also help us build a legacy of hope, healing and resiliency across the spectrum of communities of color and beyond. With these funds, we look forward to deeply exploring and embracing our her-stories from the ground up. Our stories will be retold through the eyes of ancient wisdom.</p>
<p>Please know that we are grateful for whatever you can contribute, as no gift is too small!</p>
<p>Your support makes a difference to every woman and child able to attend our <i>Retreat </i>as well as to those who love us and benefit directly or indirectly from our work in the world!</p>

Prior to this, in 2015, I co-founded the late California Women of Color Herbal Symposium- a prime example of these needed spaces for Women of Color. However, the more sustainable they are- the better we fare!
This October is our 1st WOCHH Retreat , welcoming women of color from all lineages and ages to gather in celebration and healing. It is a place for grandmothers, mothers, daughters and granddaughters to have an inter-generational experience rooted in ancient wisdom. This precious and necessary space invites a deep awakening, embodiment, connection and inspiration through plant medicine teachings, indigenous life skills, womb wellness, nourishing meals and sisterhood. It is a homecoming and opportunity to teach, learn, rest, rejuvenate and commune with and on sacred land.
The WOCHH Retreat hopes to inspire:

A deeper connection to the plants & their medicines
An awakening and reclaiming of ancestral lineage and ancient medicine ways
Embodiment of self-care practices and healing from the inside out
Self & community empowerment
Cultivation of a strong sisterhood and healing community


Class Offerings:

Dreaming w/Plants
Distillation and the Art of Self Care w/Essential Oils & Hydrosols
Flower Medicine for the Heart & Spirit
Healing the Womb through Reproductive Justice & Traditional Medicine
Connecting w/Spirit Guides
Herbal Skin Care
Natural Plant Dying
Ma Yoni 'aT Womb Yoga

Ceremonial Offerings:

Rites of the Womb
Embodiment Healing
Fire Circle
Indigenous Dance & Drumming

 
We really need your help!
We are looking to raise $15,000 and believe that it IS possible with the help of community!
We recognize that we are holding something truly sacred in the palm of our hands- a radical healing movement ready to be born. We are working as diligently as possible in the deep alchemy stages of creating something from nothing. This is part of the magic and medicine we carry as peoples of color, and yet, we are trying hard to break the cycle of giving to the point of depletion and debt, as many of our ancestors were either not paid fair wages or at all for their labor.
As we bloom from survival mode into a thriving space of existence with your help, our intention is to bring this healing work forward into our community and beyond in a way that is sustainable from the inside out. We intend for this abundance to ripple forward to future generations who will, in turn, carry forth this sacred work.  All of this, however, requires a strong financial foundation.
We anticipate anywhere from 60 to 80 women and girls to be in attendance at the Retreat. And while the desire is high, the funds are low and intimidating for some potential participants who live paycheck to paycheck. We would like that no one be turned away for lack of funds.
While registration fees will cover much of the venue cost, there are external expenses that cannot be met without this funding.
Your donation will help us to cover:

Educational & printing costs
Teacher compensation
Scholarships
Class supplies
Administration costs
Seed funding to reserve next year's venue

Your contribution will also help us build a legacy of hope, healing and resiliency across the spectrum of communities of color and beyond. With these funds, we look forward to deeply exploring and embracing our her-stories from the ground up. Our stories will be retold through the eyes of ancient wisdom.
Please know that we are grateful for whatever you can contribute, as no gift is too small!
Your support makes a difference to every woman and child able to attend our Retreat as well as to those who love us and benefit directly or indirectly from our work in the world!

<h3>Vital Beat, Perth's Hip Hop Yoga studio, is coming to the north!</h3>
<p>After 18 months delivering Hip Hop Yoga to the 6056 'hood, we're now bringing our signature style of beats &amp; flows, to a space the City of Joondalup - and YOU can help us create the location you've been dreaming of.</p>
<p>We're a small family business with a dedication to building a <strong>powerful community around a love of yoga,</strong> and we want to show north-side how we pair our signature yoga with the kind of tunes that bring a smile to your face, and a wiggle to your hips. </p>
<h2><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong></h2>
<p>At the heart of true joy, we can always find <strong>music</strong> - music elevates our moods, warms our soul, enhances our performance, and stimulates our creative energy. It has the power to heal our hearts and enrich our lives.</p>
<p>The merging of music and yoga is not a new concept, but the music we choose at Vital Beat is a <strong>special kind of fun.</strong> It makes you smile, laugh, and wiggle your hips in downward dog. It makes you tap your fingers on the mat, hum your favourite tune, and get lost in the beauty of the beat. Yoga is the pursuit of bliss, the union of our mind, spirit, and body, through movement and breath. At Vital Beat we simply add a layer of rad music to help carry you out of your daily grind and bring you to a state of being present on your mat.</p>
<p>Hip hop yoga blends a dynamic flow yoga class with hip hop, RnB, funk, and soul, to create a fun, non-judgemental, and vibrant atmosphere. Our teachers are <strong>talented, warm, engaged, and supportive.</strong> Our Classes are <strong>energising, interesting, and both laughter &amp; booty shaking are encouraged.</strong> Hip hop yoga embraces the therapeutic and joy-inducing benefits of music, and a sweet bass line, to take students through their practice. We sweat, we stretch, then we savasana!</p>
<p>Do we have just one class style? Nope! We offer Hip Hop Vinyasa, Slow Jamz Flow, Slow Jamz Yin/Yang, Soul Train Yin, Yogasculpt, Pregnancy Yoga, Mums n Bubs Yoga, Family Yoga, Kids Yoga, Meditation Classes, Charity Events &amp; Retreats.</p>
<p>Want to know more about the class styles we offer? <strong>Pay us a visit at our Midland studio!</strong> Or check out our <a href=""http://www.vitalbeat.com.au/classes"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>class descriptions here</strong></a></p>
<h2><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</strong></h2>
<p>Opening a new premises is no mean feat, and we're going to need a few things to get us off the ground!</p>
<p><strong>1. Flooring </strong>-  warm, smooth, hygienic, and kind on your body</p>
<p><strong>2. A sound system</strong> - because yoga + beats calls for a kickass stereo &amp; subwoofer (fully sick)</p>
<p><strong>3. Yoga props</strong> - bolsters, mats, blocks, and straps for a comfortable, supported practice, and</p>
<p><strong>4. Furniture</strong> for a beautiful, calming, reception area that just makes you want to hang out!</p>
<p><strong>5. Insurance</strong>, to protect both our premises, and our amazing teachers &amp; students</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And here's the thing though... we would never ask for something for nothing!! Unless of course you're utterly altruistic and thats cool too!</p>
<p>For your contribution to <strong>making our dreams a reality</strong>, you get amazing gifts, like discounts and access to our classes. Dont live near Joondalup? Thats fine! You can choose to use your class passes at our Midland studio!*</p>

I was starting to despair when this opportunity kept presenting itself in many unexpected ways over a couple of weeks, a dream, several people whom Id never met telling me about it, a relations new business same title.

I and a reflexologist, by using the feet according to ancient chinese medicine it is possible to stimulate or soothe all of the body internal and external, opening the meridians to help the healing process. I am also qualified in Indianhead massage which is great for headaches and neck tension from office work and driving. Hopi ear candles which are helpful for migraines, sinus problems and are very calming for people or children who have ADHD, and lastly I am also qualified in Crystal Reiki.

Her presence, speech, and instructions were charged with clarity on a level I had never encountered previously. I attended her classes as much as possible and then in 2008, decided to stop my life in New York City, give away all my belongings, and purchased a one way ticket to India. Shortly thereafter, I was working in a school in South India, for children with autism, and incorporating yoga and meditation, into their curriculum. After 3 months in this school, the way became clear to travel to the north of India, to Dehradun, and study yoga with Swati and Rajiv Chanchani who implemented a national program of Yoga In Schools across India. I took the train for several days and arrived in Dehradun where I got into a white taxi, who drove me into town, and as I exited the taxi, a nun was standing there, and told me to go and get a blessing from His Holiness Sakya Trizin who lived just up the road, in his home monastery. This interaction was again full of intense clarity and also love. After several days in my little home at the Yoga Centre, I woke up one morning, and knew it was time to go down the hill and meet His Holiness Sakya Trizin. I skipped yoga class, and literally ran several kilometres down the hill to the temple. On the way down the hill a, Tibetan woman, Drolma, smiled and handed me a white kata, which I had no idea, what to do with, but I accepted this fortuitous offering. Then, I reached the temple, climbed the steps, and felt time and space literally stop, as I saw His Holiness Sakya Trizin sitting on his throne. Somehow I already knew what to do, to prostrate, to offer the kata, kneel for a blessing. I experienced the greatest peace - within - during this encounter. After this blessing, I sat down, as close to His Holiness, as possible, for about 6 hours, until the temple closed. Since this moment, in 2008, I have been listening to my teacher, His Holiness Sakya Trizin, speak of matters that have become increasingly important to me, and dearer to my heart, than I can express in words. I am indescribably grateful to HH Sakya Trizin and Khenpo Appey Rinpoche for their profound Root Teachings. <span><br/></span><span><span>Now, 6 years later, I have the incredible opportunity to make an 8 month, traditional, approximation, retreat with my teacher. This is the first time, such a precious gem, is even being offered in the western world. I am absolutely ripe and ready for this retreat, and the causes and conditions are arising in a positive way to support this aim of practicing and accomplishing the retreat. This is the step I have wished and aspired to take for 2 years, and now it's arrived. May this benefit all.</span></span><p><span><span></span></span></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/485453/files/20140405054039-DSC01582.JPG?1396701639"" src="""" style=""width: 232.9819277108434px; height: 425px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I am asking for and offering</h3><div>I am asking for the external support of 2,400 Euros and I will match this support from my own funds. The funding is going to the centre where I will make my retreat, as they will be providing my daily needs for the duration of retreat. <p></p>
<p>The Impact:<br/></p>
<p></p>The concept of retreat crosses many disciplines. Basically, it's an impeccable opportunity to practice without distractions, and in this way is a pure gift. I know that my perception of the world is deeply linked with my internal attitude. The process of transforming the inner self begins with the practices of meditation, recitations of sutras, and visualisations, among other things. By opening the mind of my heart - step by step - I can be free from illusions, expectations, ignorance, hope, and fear. <span><br/></span><p><span><br/></span><span>I have successfully completed two retreats before, one in India, and another in Nepal though not of this length. I am so inspired by other practitioners who have completed longer retreats and integrated these realisations into their daily life. I also know I am so fortunate to encounter this opportunity so young. In the words of the great master His Eminence Chogye Trichen Rinpoche, ""may the wealth which matures into the quintessence of dual benefit, be received, practiced, and transmitted on the fingertips of the fortunate, for time and space without beginning or ending.""<br/></span><span></span><br/></p>

I skipped yoga class, and literally ran several kilometres down the hill to the temple. On the way down the hill a, Tibetan woman, Drolma, smiled and handed me a white kata, which I had no idea, what to do with, but I accepted this fortuitous offering. Then, I reached the temple, climbed the steps, and felt time and space literally stop, as I saw His Holiness Sakya Trizin sitting on his throne. Somehow I already knew what to do, to prostrate, to offer the kata, kneel for a blessing. I experienced the greatest peace - within - during this encounter. After this blessing, I sat down, as close to His Holiness, as possible, for about 6 hours, until the temple closed. Since this moment, in 2008, I have been listening to my teacher, His Holiness Sakya Trizin, speak of matters that have become increasingly important to me, and dearer to my heart, than I can express in words. I am indescribably grateful to HH Sakya Trizin and Khenpo Appey Rinpoche for their profound Root Teachings. Now, 6 years later, I have the incredible opportunity to make an 8 month, traditional, approximation, retreat with my teacher. This is the first time, such a precious gem, is even being offered in the western world. I am absolutely ripe and ready for this retreat, and the causes and conditions are arising in a positive way to support this aim of practicing and accomplishing the retreat. This is the step I have wished and aspired to take for 2 years, and now it's arrived. May this benefit all.What I am asking for and offeringI am asking for the external support of 2,400 Euros and I will match this support from my own funds. The funding is going to the centre where I will make my retreat, as they will be providing my daily needs for the duration of retreat. 
The Impact:
The concept of retreat crosses many disciplines. Basically, it's an impeccable opportunity to practice without distractions, and in this way is a pure gift. I know that my perception of the world is deeply linked with my internal attitude. The process of transforming the inner self begins with the practices of meditation, recitations of sutras, and visualisations, among other things. By opening the mind of my heart - step by step - I can be free from illusions, expectations, ignorance, hope, and fear. I have successfully completed two retreats before, one in India, and another in Nepal though not of this length. I am so inspired by other practitioners who have completed longer retreats and integrated these realisations into their daily life. I also know I am so fortunate to encounter this opportunity so young. In the words of the great master His Eminence Chogye Trichen Rinpoche, ""may the wealth which matures into the quintessence of dual benefit, be received, practiced, and transmitted on the fingertips of the fortunate, for time and space without beginning or ending.""

<p>Let me tell you about my dog Osiris, she saved my life on more than one occasion, it may sound dramatic and maybe it is but without her I would have lost all hope in living. Osiris is an amazing, powerful spirit who came into my life at just the right time. She is playful, determined, and just doesn't give up and now she needs my help. </p>
<p>Like many dog breeds, Osiris is prone to torn ACL's and desperately needs surgery to return her to a life of adventure, play and outdoor living. It's not been easy to ask you for help, as her owner I've worked really hard to save the money for her surgery. I'm an Uber driver and work at a pet hotel but every time I saved money life came up. Osiris is in pain, I don't want to let my pride get in the way of her being happy, healthy and pain free. </p>
<p>So here is the deal, I've met a lot of other people who have dogs that suffer from the same problem, I want to earn enough to get Osiris surgery and then work with my vet to help other families get the same treatment for their dogs. Of course your donation comes with swag, check out our perks. </p>

<p>Remember, all the moneys past our goal will help other dogs get the same surgery. </p>
</div></div>","Let me tell you about my dog Osiris, she saved my life on more than one occasion, it may sound dramatic and maybe it is but without her I would have lost all hope in living. Osiris is an amazing, powerful spirit who came into my life at just the right time. She is playful, determined, and just doesn't give up and now she needs my help. 
Like many dog breeds, Osiris is prone to torn ACL's and desperately needs surgery to return her to a life of adventure, play and outdoor living. It's not been easy to ask you for help, as her owner I've worked really hard to save the money for her surgery. I'm an Uber driver and work at a pet hotel but every time I saved money life came up. Osiris is in pain, I don't want to let my pride get in the way of her being happy, healthy and pain free. 
So here is the deal, I've met a lot of other people who have dogs that suffer from the same problem, I want to earn enough to get Osiris surgery and then work with my vet to help other families get the same treatment for their dogs. Of course your donation comes with swag, check out our perks. 
And please don't forget to share this with your friends and other dog lovers. 
Remember, all the moneys past our goal will help other dogs get the same surgery.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Take a moment and think...</p>
<p>Think about washing your hands; think about getting a glass of water, flushing the toilet, wash your hands with hands soaps... These are all things that most of us consider pretty essential to maintaining good personal hygiene to prevent water communicable diseases, right?</p>
<p>Now imagine that you were born into different circumstances. This is what life is like for millions of people in India’s most marginalised communities every single day. But with your help, we can change this.</p>
<p>In India, diarrhoea alone causes more than 1,600 deaths every 24 hours. At the root of this, more often than not, are unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices and facilities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our solution to this unfortunate situation is our HandWashing project, a small-scale, grassroots program with that will have a big impact. We plan to start a fundraising campaign which seeks to collect HAND SOAPS (50 gr size) to reach out to remote localities and help educate children in rural communities in north India.</p>
<p>We will provide 3000 hand soaps and 2 informative posters to each school (one in English and one in Hindi) for 6780 children of 24 schools and one orphanage in western Uttar Pradesh, eastern Haryana and New Delhi. The collection of funds will start the 8th of October until the 31st of October 2018.<br/><br/>Once we collect the funds for our project, we will prepare the distribution of the hand soaps to the children in the selected schools, as well as schedule the workshops during the provision of hand soaps (which will begin around the 1st of November until the 15th of November 2018). Then we will gather feedbacks forms from the schools teachers and principals to elaborate the final report of the project and its results.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact that HEEALS wants to foster in children is to change behaviors on handwashing and WASH practices. This approach through handwashing training, adaptation and integration, will prevent children to suffer water communicable diseases and others infections, focusing their growth just in academic goals.</p>
<p>HEEALS seeks to improve access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by spreading the message on the importance of WASH practices to families in remote communities, creating networks between other communities improving the life conditions of the society. Using proper hand hygiene to keep hands clean is critical to reducing the risk of health care-associated infections in people. To reach the objective, it is crucial to support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management as well as stop open defecation practices, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The largest democracy in the world carries with it the world's hungriest country; Around 220 million Indians struggle to get the 2100 calories a day recommended by the WHO. Currently, India is the tenth richest country in the world and the first in number of undernourished. Child malnutrition rates in India are almost five times higher than in China and twice as high as in Sub-Saharan countries. Nearly half of all children - approximately 60 million - are underweight, 45% have excessive growth retardation for their age, 20% are stunted in growth (too thin for height, indicating acute malnutrition), 75% have anemia, and 57% lack a vitamin A.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We also have several reports that highlight the need for WASH intervention in marginalized communities. The reports are available for viewing on our website: (<a href=""http://heeals.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://heeals.org</a>). As any NGO working towards a cause, the only obstacle to our endeavors is the lack of funding.</p>
<p><br/>We look forward for your assistance to increase our financial resources to help materialize this campaign into a movement it is capable of being. We would be extremely glad and indebted with gratitude if your collaboration could help us achieve our dream.</p>

<h3>Make my hair make a difference.</h3>
<p>Hi there! I'm Gabriel Creek. About 6 years ago my dad was diagnosed with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. It a progressive disease of the lungs where the tiny air sacs in the lungs (bronchioles) lose their elasticity. That's the ""Pulmonary Fibrosis"" part. Doctors often don't know the cause. That's what makes it ""Idiopathic."" My dad was one of the lucky ones.  He was able to qualify for a lung transplant. Without that surgery he was not going to be with us much longer. My dad's outcome only happens in about 6% of cases.</p>
<p>In March of 2020 I got a haircut. (I know, I know - which hair did I cut? Har har.) Little did I know, shortly after that, the Covid crisis would hit and the bottom of the world dropped out. I've not been to a barber since. My hair is now quite long, and I want to make a bald..er...bold choice with it. So I'm holding a contest for my next hairdo. </p>
<p>Here's the deal: My hair is long enough that I can donate it to Children with Hair Loss. They create wigs for kids with medical conditions where hair loss is common (Chemotherapy, Alopecia, etc.). And my hair is soft and luxurious if I do say so myself. So I thought I'd donate my hair to them. Simple enough, right?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>But what about the hair you'll have left?</h3>
<p>That's where you come in. I've decided to create a contest for my next hairdo. You'll vote with your donations for the next 30 days. At the end of the 30 days, if I have reached at least $1000, I will drive myself right to the barber shop and cut my hair in the style that received the most dollars. </p>
<p>Here's the catch: If I don't make $1000 in donations I get to choose my own style. But if we meet or exceed $1000, then I will not only get the style that received the most votes, but I must wear that style for a complete month before I can do anything about it.</p>
<p>Either way, all hair will go to Children with Hair Loss, and whatever donations I receive will go to the IPF Foundation. So even if we don't hit our goal, we'll still be able to make at least a small difference.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My plan is to take whatever funds this campaign raises, and split the donations between two organizations: The IFP Foundation, and Children with Hair Loss. I'll send 75% of the donations to the IPF Foundation, and Children with Hair Loss will get 25% and my gorgeous locks.</p>
<p>The IPF Foundation is an independent, nonprofit organization founded with the mission to accelerate cures for IPF. We are here with a singular purpose — to support medical research to discover treatments and cures for pulmonary fibrosis. </p>
<p>IPF incidence has doubled over the last decade. As a disease, IPF kills an estimated 50,000 people annually, with roughly half of all cases going undiagnosed. Despite the large number of lives impacted by IPF, it continues to be under recognized, and under studied. (<a href=""https://ipffoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://ipffoundation.org/</a>)</p>
<p>Children With Hair Loss is a 501 (c) 3 non-profit organization that provides human hair replacements at no cost to children and young adults facing medically-related hair loss.  When a child's hair is lost due to Cancer treatments, Alopecia, Trichotillomania, Burns, etc., the painful effects are far deeper than just cosmetic.  Each year, the number of children requesting our hair replacements increases and with your support, we can continue to increase the number of children we are able to help in the future!

<p>East Tennessee Children’s Hospital is a non-profit that provides top medical care in the region for those who cannot afford it. They have an open door policy that doesn’t discriminate against race, religion, gender, or economic status.  They are committed to helping families and their children who do not have sufficient means to pay for health insurance or medical resources.</p>
<br/><p>Where are your funds going? A LiteGait. What’s a LiteGait?

I am a 500 hour certified yoga instructor, Reiki Master, EFT Certified Practitioner, and Artist.</strong></p><p>It has always been my mission to give to my community and the world. I am happy that the mantra ""Think Global. Act Local."" is now used so commonly. The best way to give to the world—my sphere of concern—and make it thrive for us all is by doing what I can within my sphere of influence.</p><p>I have lived in Long Beach, my sphere of influence, for 32 years, having grown up in the Bixby Knolls neighborhood where I have been a student, desk receptionist, and teacher at FreeSpirit Yoga for the past 9 years. I went to high school at Long Beach Polytechnic, and college and graduate school at Cal State Long Beach. I currently reside in Downtown Long Beach.</p><p>My life has very much been about giving to my Long Beach community<strong>. </strong>Aside from running my own healing business for the past 7 years as a sole-proprietor, I have taught free yoga to low-income seniors, people in addiction recovery programs, homeless in shelters; and given away countless teaching hours to people who simply cannot afford it.  I am a founding member of The Friendship Neighborhood, a neighborhood non-profit organization in Downtown Long Beach serving a polarized urban residential area. In the past two years I have personally raised over $1500 for non-profit organizations that work with the homeless in Los Angeles, and advised on projects that raised nearly $40,000 for homeless youth shelters.</p><p>All my work in the yoga community and with the less-fortunate has prepared me to become the owner of FreeSpirit Yoga, for which I am now seeking your help.</p><p>The previous owners of FreeSpirit Yoga have done a fantastic job creating a heart-centered business. This yoga studio is already the perfect space and has the perfect foundation for what I intend to evolve into a broader community space for the up-and-coming neighborhood of Bixby Knolls, supporting a model for how a community can develop without losing its traditions, diversity, or soul.</p><p>The self-care and holistic wellness industry has for too long treated self-care as a means to an end. And, there is nothing wrong with that! It's important for people to feel good in their mind, body, and spirit. Having a safe space to recharge and connect to our inner worlds is paramount to our wellness as human beings. FreeSpirit Yoga is already this space, doing an amazing job of getting people feeling comfortable in their own skin and learning how to relax and recharge.</p><p>I will honor all current students and reach out to the wider demographics of the neighborhood, bringing people together to learn and practice yoga and many other holistic wellness techniques such as Reiki, journaling, meditation, and EFT.</p><p>It is now merely the time to take the next step in self-healing, which is to take those good feelings and that charged up inspiration out into the world, with the intention of giving. As the new owner of FreeSpirit Yoga my mission is to bring all of our peace, tranquility, self actualization, strength, and flexibility into the world, to give and demonstrate how strong community multiplies the benefits of our personal self-care practice. In fact, this is why the self-care movement has been so positive. Many people are prepared, for the first time in their lives, to give with the highest intention of serving all.</p><p>I intend to add a community outreach program to FreeSpirit Yoga where students will have the opportunity to give to their community by participating in enriching activities such as neighborhood trash clean-ups, food drives, furnishing homes for low-income families—the possibilities are endless. The ways in which the students at FreeSpirit Yoga will be able to give to their community through organized service will evolve, just as their self-care evolves. I want the world to see that Yogis do more than just sit up straight, breathe, and be serene. We can give our good energy to our community and our world! </p><p>Contributors will not only have the opportunity to become members and even VIP members of FreeSpirit Yoga, which means they will get to come to our space and do yoga, they will also be contributing to the wellness of the entire neighborhood of Bixby Knolls as well as the City of Long Beach. Contributors will be investing in a new model of self-care that goes beyond the individual empowerment, and sees that energy turning back outwards. Contributors will be supporting a new emphasis on self-care with the intention of serving all, not just feeling good for the sake of feeling good, which, again, was a necessary step!</p><p>I was born and raised in Long Beach. I will always give my skills, service, and love to the city that has given so much to me. By keeping the studio in the hands of a dedicated community member, we ensure that the human beings in the space and the values of the space are honored and can be allowed to evolve.

We are offering smaller class packages as well. </p><p>Along with yoga other perks include: prints of Cassandra's own macro-flower photography, Reiki packages, EFT (tapping) packages, and Tarot Card readings. Fabian Bouthillette has offered one-on-one self-study counseling through his Intuitive Integrity Journaling program.</p><p>If I don't reach my entire goal, [EDIT: I've reached my goal and will buy the studio. Raising funds to buy the studio out-right and cover start-up costs, now.] I will invest in my current business, which is already expanding and growing in the ways I've described to you. Specifically, I already have collaborations with Michael Tardiff, a former army paratrooper in the 82<sup>nd</sup> airborne, and Fabian Bouthillette, a former navy officer and graduate of the United States Naval Academy. These two veterans are well established in southern California as peace activists and as healers. Both Michael and Fabian are active with Vets Journey Home, a community healing program among veterans, and with The Wilderness Institute in Ventura County. They share the same mission of expanding self-care into community healing, and support the creation of a space in Long Beach to do this. Collaboration with other “global thinkers, local actors” is already in motion. In my mind and heart (and theirs) not making the goal on this campaign is not an option. The power and benefit of continuing and building on FreeSpirit Yoga’s location, space, and reputation is too great to give up, especially with immediate opportunity for greater collaboration.</p><p>The main challenges I foresee after creating the funding is filling the big shoes that our amazing previous owners are leaving behind. I know that to be the owner of a space like FreeSpirit will challenge me to grow as a leader, a professional, a business woman, and as a spiritual guide. I am confident that I have a huge support system of loving people who will be there for me throughout this entire endeavor. As a woman who has dedicated her life to the practice of yoga and other healing arts, I have many tools, healers, and coaches at my disposal to support me as I grow into the owner and leader of the space. As of right now the studio is in a great place and I intend to keep it great, and increase its greatness in all ways possible.  </p><p>Lastly, if one wants to contribute to the campaign in other ways that do not involve money, you can always share and promote the campaign on your social media, let people know by telling them in person, and check in with Cassandra to see what else is needed.

</div></div>","Summary
Sylvia House will be a bridge between drug/alcohol treatment and long-term sobriety, a transitional home where women can practice healthy habits and address underlying psychological barriers to recovery.
 
The Need
Addiction touches everyone. If you yourself have not struggled, you know or love someone who has. 
The US opiate epidemic has reached devastating proportions: over 60,000 overdose deaths in 2016, and 1 in 7 Americans facing a substance use disorder. Addiction is progressive, chronic, and relapsing. Among people who receive treatment, the relapse rate is 40-60%. 
But there is hope-- addiction is treatable.
Longer periods of support and treatment increase the likelihood of long-term sobriety. Sylvia House will build the safe environment and structured program women in recovery need and deserve. 
 
A Women-Only Space
Women are more powerfully impacted by the social and physiological consequences of addiction, and 80% of women who seek treatment are trauma survivors. Sylvia House will be a safe, secure, and nurturing home, and our program will address the unique challenges and needs of women in early recovery. 
 
Better Than Other Sober Homes 
The current marketplace consists primarily of three types of sober living homes:

Non-profit shelter-like environments that are a needed alternative to homelessness and sex work
For-profit houses that engage in patient brokering, exploitation of insurance benefits, and predatory advertising.  
Luxury West Coast homes that focus on spa-like accommodations instead of life skill development and relapse prevention

Sylvia House will 1.) be more comfortable and safer than the nonprofits, 2.) operate with rigorous integrity and a Board of Advisors, and 3.) implement an action-based therapeutic program. 
 
What We Need
We need help with startup costs: acquisition of a rental home and purchasing household items. We also need help with all the typical expenses of opening a business: legal, accounting, etc. For a detailed breakdown of fund use, visit the Use of Crowdfunded Money page on our website.

<p>Hello! We are students at the University of Tennessee, and we are working together to raise money for The Restoration House in order to help them continue building new housing for single-mothers and their families. Thank you so much for giving us your time!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Restoration House is a nonprofit organization that walks alongside single-mothers, assisting them develop career readiness and to become more financially responsible. One of the biggest ways The Restoration House assists single-mothers is through providing transitional housing to the families in need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently The Restoration House is working on ‘building Phase II’ of their own transitional housing complex, known as The Village. The Village currently has six living units as well as a community center. Plans for ‘building Phase II’ will add an additional eighteen living units, bringing the total up to twenty-four.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With this addition The Village would have the potential to help up to 160 single mothers and up to 320 children over the next ten years. Along with being able to help more families in need, the expansion would decrease the cost per family by 59%.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With 18 new families moving in to The Village there is an increasing need for more laptops in the community center for parents and children to use. The donations we receive will go toward purchasing more laptops, as well as a locking cabinet and a charging station for the laptops.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is where we need your help. As of now The Restoration House is in the fundraising part of building Phase II and we need your help to reach our goal and help them to provide housing for a single-mother and their family in need.</p>

We're confident we can sell 5,000 sticks of BasicallYours quickly, but we need funding to bridge the gap.<br/><br/>So, we decided to have our first round of fundraising via crowdfunding to prove just how passionate people get about a natural deodorant that actually works.</p>

<p>We are providing products that are very thoughtfully crafted in a way that preserves the integrity of the natural world and the conscientious consumer. It is our mission to make sure that everything we do is beneficial, not only to the people who use our products, but also those involved in the sourcing of the materials we use at every level. We live in a critical time, where caring about the environment is more important than ever. We are not about following a ""green"" trend, but rather about making a meaningful impact on our environment, both in our immediate surroundings and the larger world. We wish to promote a respectful and sustainable connectivity, recognizing that our actions do not just affect us, but all of those involved, from our customers to our purveyors to those who grow, forage, and make the ingredients we use. </p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We have been very diligent about educating ourselves not only when is comes to aspects of this particular industry, but also practical principles of ethics, particularly when it comes to making holistic and natural products in this global economy. </p>
<p>In the US, men and women use about 10 personal care products a day - things like body wash, shampoo, face lotion, deodorant, fragrance, sunscreen, etc.</p>
<p>On average, each of these products contain 10-15 different synthetic chemicals, exposing us a wide array synthetic chemicals every day, even before we’ve left the house.</p>
<p>While some of these chemicals are proven to be safe, many are known or suspected toxins and the vast majority (80%) have not been adequately tested for safe use on humans.</p>
<p>Research now shows that these toxins can penetrate the skin (or are otherwise ingested), potentially causing serious health issues over time (cancer, reproductive issues, neurological issues, etc).</p>
<p>How can this be? Turns out the US personal care industry is completely unregulated. Companies have free rein to choose from over 10,000 synthetic chemicals to formulate cheap - and often unhealthy - products.</p>
<p>In fact in the US there’s been no new regulation governing the use of chemicals for personal care since 1938! While the FDA has only banned 11 ingredients since then, the more cautious European Union has banned over 1,300. </p>
<p>But there’s hope! With recent advances in ‘green chemistry’, today it’s possible to formulate all-natural products that perform as well as - or even better than - conventional products.</p>

</div></div>","Hi! My name is Cameron Stack and I am the President and CEO of BasicallYours. Currently, I am a full-time student at Utah Valley University with an entrepreneurial mindset, aimed at making a difference in the world. I have two passions, one is traveling and exploring the wonderful earth, we live on and the other is to continually innovate while giving back to the world.  I would like to pursue my passion for innovation and would love to continually take strides in coming up with new ideas and creating products that would make a difference in our society and our world.
With that in mind, we are asking for your help in launching our first line of product for our all natural handcrafted skin and body company BasicallYours. 
Quality Ingredients. I'm working with crazy good vendors and using top notch product and still not overcharging, I think it's important to be economical and still not sacrifice on the quality of a good product.

We are hoping to raise $25,000 to help pay for: 

Ethical, organic, natural, ingredients including essential oils, natural base oils, soaps, and herbs.
Sustainable packaging, including UV-blocking glass bottles, steel tins made in the USA, and biodegradable, recyclable, and reusable natural paper products.
Production costs, including space and the tools, needed to make our products.
Pay all of are hard-working Interns and team members.
Legal licensing for wholesale and trademarking.
Marketing, travel, and outreach to help build our brand.
Website maintenance

The backbreaking manual labor of creating the product ourselves didn't bother us back, But now that we're growing and we're struggling to keep up with demand. We're confident we can sell 5,000 sticks of BasicallYours quickly, but we need funding to bridge the gap.So, we decided to have our first round of fundraising via crowdfunding to prove just how passionate people get about a natural deodorant that actually works.

If we raise 25K


What you get out of it! 

With your support, we will be able to do many great things for our business and brand. You will be helping us work towards being an impactful presence in the skin care community, so we want to give you something back. 
Long Term Goals:
Education and empower consumers about their health
Launch other non-toxic products
Expand into retail and get athlete sponsorship

For our largest contributors, we will meet with you and  customize a complete aromatherapeutic experience for your body and your home.What your Money helps do. Your contributions are so greatly appreciated and will go towards the labels, packaging, product, marketing efforts, and cost of other product development. Thank you so so much!!If we do not reach our goal... 
While our goal is to raise the entire $25,000, we understand that this goal may not be reached. Regardless of the level of funds we raise, all proceeds will go towards the development and continued creation of ethically produced sustainable skin care in line with our mission. 
We are providing products that are very thoughtfully crafted in a way that preserves the integrity of the natural world and the conscientious consumer. It is our mission to make sure that everything we do is beneficial, not only to the people who use our products, but also those involved in the sourcing of the materials we use at every level. We live in a critical time, where caring about the environment is more important than ever. We are not about following a ""green"" trend, but rather about making a meaningful impact on our environment, both in our immediate surroundings and the larger world. We wish to promote a respectful and sustainable connectivity, recognizing that our actions do not just affect us, but all of those involved, from our customers to our purveyors to those who grow, forage, and make the ingredients we use. 


We have been very diligent about educating ourselves not only when is comes to aspects of this particular industry, but also practical principles of ethics, particularly when it comes to making holistic and natural products in this global economy. 
In the US, men and women use about 10 personal care products a day - things like body wash, shampoo, face lotion, deodorant, fragrance, sunscreen, etc.
On average, each of these products contain 10-15 different synthetic chemicals, exposing us a wide array synthetic chemicals every day, even before we’ve left the house.
While some of these chemicals are proven to be safe, many are known or suspected toxins and the vast majority (80%) have not been adequately tested for safe use on humans.
Research now shows that these toxins can penetrate the skin (or are otherwise ingested), potentially causing serious health issues over time (cancer, reproductive issues, neurological issues, etc).
How can this be? Turns out the US personal care industry is completely unregulated. Companies have free rein to choose from over 10,000 synthetic chemicals to formulate cheap - and often unhealthy - products.
In fact in the US there’s been no new regulation governing the use of chemicals for personal care since 1938! While the FDA has only banned 11 ingredients since then, the more cautious European Union has banned over 1,300. 
But there’s hope! With recent advances in ‘green chemistry’, today it’s possible to formulate all-natural products that perform as well as - or even better than - conventional products.

How BasicallYours Gives Back
for every $100 dollars we make will plant a tree in the forest of California and grow back what was killed in wildfires or such and help the planet one tree at a time.
What We Need & What You Get 
Not only do you get products you want at discounted prices, plus your able help us create more amazing products!

Where are your products made? BasicallYours LLC is based in Provo, UT and all of the products are proudly manufactured in the USA.
When will you ship out the products?
Shortly after the campaign ends, we’ll take a couple of weeks to process orders, fulfill, and send them out, approximately late December. Everyone is guaranteed to get their products!

<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>There are an estimated 567,715 people in the United States experiencing homelessness on a given night, according to the most recent national point-in-time estimate (January 2019). This represents a rate of approximately 17 people experiencing homelessness per every 10,000 people in the general population.</p>
<p>While this number had been steadily decreasing since 2007, in the last two years it has started to increase, the pandemic has pushed more families under the poverty line many of which have become homeless in the last couple of months.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617429361/t7exadkrawcotggkb5if.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>As more and more people are living and sleeping on the streets. All of them, are struggling with hygiene. there are fewer than 20 shower stalls and toilets for thousands of homeless individuals, in any given city or town, at some places people must wait their turn for weeks or even months to just get a shower.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>At Organization Of Hope, we believe that with hygiene comes dignity and with dignity and opportunity.</strong></p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617429421/rxmngvyhlxi20mqweclk.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>Every night, there are 3,500 homeless men, women and children in Baltimore City and 11,623 homeless people within the greater Washington DC region. Due to the lack of access to existing shelters.</p>
<p><strong><i>The Organization of Hope will provide Mobile Hygiene services to the homeless to increase their access.</i></strong></p>
<p>There are only 13 emergency shelters in Baltimore City and only 7 places in the Washington DC area.</p>
<p>Both venues face this challenge daily, with the number of people to be served and limited capacities to accommodate them The Organization of Hope team will be coming out to deliver the hygiene service.</p>

Ancillary motion picture equipment will make this possible.Production                                                                                                      We are so pleased to inform you that we have in place a top shelf graphic design team, social media analyst as well as digital platform developers.  This team has the absolute capability of bringing the Rest programs into the digital world, thereby allowing people across the globe access to this most important and necessary calming resource.Fees / Perks / Overheads                                                                        We are so thankful for the support offered by all those involved with our campaign.  This rewards your valuable time and contribution. We would be sincerely grateful to hear directly from anyone who would be interested in either supporting Rest in a continual sponsorship capacity (such as ongoing travel costs), or by providing means of assistance other than financial support, or even by means of significant donation.  Please contact us directly at info@btmv.rest  We are a husband and wife team, blessed and supported by our 6 wonderful children. We are thankful to call the Sunshine Coast in Queensland Australia, home. We are Craig and Nicole.  Our combined family is the BTMV team!  With combined experience in music, lifestyle and wellness coaching, photography and cinematography we are well equipped to put these programs together. We have received the greatest satisfaction from our time spent so far in developing the Rest program.  We are about to complete our first DVD/BluRay/Ultra High Definition compilation for public distribution.  Through broadcast, our programs have already been viewed multiple times in many countries over the world. We are so looking forward to you joining with us as we continue to further develop ultra high quality Rest programs that we know will bring peace, calm, hope and rest into the lives of so many people We sincerely believe in the power of Rest. Our collective risk is that we do not have the necessary funds to take these programs to the next required level, and therefore risk not bringing Rest to those so desperately in need.  BTMV is committed to bringing the power of natures book of creation into the lives of a broken world. Thank you for your earnest support to this powerful campaign, allowing us to play our part in providing Rest for our turbulent world.​To view more about who we are, log onto www.btmv.rest We are thankful for all the support we receive.  The least we can do is to offer our heart felt appreciation and to try and say thank you through some small gift.  Please take a look at each reward level and see what fits you best.  Please know that every reward listed is not an anticipated retail value, just a small gift in recognition of your support. If you would like to just make a contribution and are not taken by any reward please just select 'Back It'.  We will still value your contribution greatly.***Please note for those interested in the Flash Drive Reward ($250), it is essential that you make all necessary checks regarding compatibility so as to avoid disappointment.  The flash drive we provide will be formatted in NFTS.  This should allow problem free viewing on all UHD devices that allow for file playing from a flash drive.  We are well aware of the mountain we are beginning to climb in endeavouring to reach our target. Even so, we have faith that you will see the incredible importance and benefit this program can bring.  With your support, we believe we can achieve this ambitious target. Together we will share Rest with the world. Our request of you is to assist us additionally by sharing our campaign with family, friends and colleagues.  We would be so grateful if you would take the time to pass your support of our campaign through Facebook, Instagram, email and any other means you can, encouraging as many as possible to join with us as we bring Rest to the world.  Please remember, wherever possible use the Indiegogo tools to share as these contribute to additional exposure for our campaign.  Our world has many opportunities for us to rest.  The very least we can do is to bring as much of natures beauty into the lives of those who through circumstance and need, may not be able to enjoy the great outdoors as freely as others.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Elliot and I am female-to-male transgender and part of my medical transition is getting top surgery. In basic terms top surgery is when you get your chest reconstructed to look more masculine. For some people top surgery is covered by their insurance. Unfortunately, my insurance does not. *Booo*</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; How You Can Help</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise $8000 before December so I can get surgery before Christmas. Asking for help can be hard so I thought I could at least make it fun for those who can help me. There are <i><strong>three</strong></i> ways you can help me reach my goal.</p>
<p><u><strong>Donate</strong></u></p>
<p>The first way is by clicking the Back It button to the side of the video. With this you can donate any amount of money you can to my surgery fund.</p>
<p><u><strong>Perks</strong></u></p>
<p>The second way is by picking one of the perks. Each perk has a different dollar amount donation. So for example, if you pick the $10 perk, you donate $10 to my surgery fund and in return I send you a picture of my cat, signed by my cat!</p>
<p><u><strong>Spread the Word</strong></u></p>
<p>I understand that not everyone can donate but that’s ok. So the third way you can help me out is by spreading the word and sharing my video. Every little bit helps!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This surgery is something I have wanted for so long and it would be a life-changing procedure. With the ability to be more comfortable in my body I will able to be a visible trans role model for those around me.</p>
<h3>Finally, Thank You!</h3>

<h3>My journey with Yoga Asana...</h3>
<p>In 2014, I took a Yoga Asana class that transformed my relationship with the practice. Surrounded by African artwork and Adinkra symbols, as I rolled out my mat, I knew this class had something special to offer.</p>
<p>Thorough yet brief descriptions of how each asana was healing us from the inside out, long-held asana poses and then guided into a transformative meditation.</p>
<p>That is the day I gained a deep love and appreciation for the practice of yoga asana. Yoga Sundays at Shades of Afrika in Long Beach, CA allowed me to access more wisdom and a deeper sense of healing. </p>
<p>The deep love and appreciation that I found for yoga is now a fabric of my life. Everywhere I go, every time I practice, I remember Yoga Sundays, holding on to the knowing. </p>
<p>Last year, I was led to leave my career in the tech industry. </p>
<p>This year, I have been called to walk in my sacred duty on Earth, as a Reiki Master &amp; Yogini. I have always known that I walk this earth to heal myself and to support others on their healing journey. As a Shamanic Reiki Practitioner, the next step in the divine plan is to earn my credentials as a Registered Yoga Teacher.</p>
<p>After yoga teacher training, I will host a healing experience infusing Yin Yoga and Shamanic Reiki. The healing experience will honor and incorporate aspects from the Yoga Sunday practice and is designed for anyone who desires to feel renewed body, mind, and soul. </p>
<p>I am amazed and thankful that I am chosen and cherished to share the healing powers of Yin Yoga &amp; Shamanic Reiki with the world.</p>

<p><strong>Shamanic Reiki Energy Healing Session: </strong>Reiki is an ancient healing art that brings balance to our spiritual, physical, mental, and emotional selves through the ""laying of hands"". During the session, healing energy is channeled to the client to clear internal blockages and activate the flow of healing. We will journey to a place of deep healing through conscious breathing while being guided by Spirit. Reiki addresses physical illness, emotional and mental disorders and allows us to return to oneness with ourselves. </p>

In 2014, I took a Yoga Asana class that transformed my relationship with the practice. Surrounded by African artwork and Adinkra symbols, as I rolled out my mat, I knew this class had something special to offer.
Thorough yet brief descriptions of how each asana was healing us from the inside out, long-held asana poses and then guided into a transformative meditation.
That is the day I gained a deep love and appreciation for the practice of yoga asana. Yoga Sundays at Shades of Afrika in Long Beach, CA allowed me to access more wisdom and a deeper sense of healing. 
The deep love and appreciation that I found for yoga is now a fabric of my life. Everywhere I go, every time I practice, I remember Yoga Sundays, holding on to the knowing. 
Last year, I was led to leave my career in the tech industry. 
This year, I have been called to walk in my sacred duty on Earth, as a Reiki Master & Yogini. I have always known that I walk this earth to heal myself and to support others on their healing journey. As a Shamanic Reiki Practitioner, the next step in the divine plan is to earn my credentials as a Registered Yoga Teacher.
After yoga teacher training, I will host a healing experience infusing Yin Yoga and Shamanic Reiki. The healing experience will honor and incorporate aspects from the Yoga Sunday practice and is designed for anyone who desires to feel renewed body, mind, and soul. 
I am amazed and thankful that I am chosen and cherished to share the healing powers of Yin Yoga & Shamanic Reiki with the world.
“Yoga is the uniting of consciousness in the heart.""
Nischala Joy Devi told by Yogi, Mila Marshall

Shamanic Reiki Energy Healing Session: Reiki is an ancient healing art that brings balance to our spiritual, physical, mental, and emotional selves through the ""laying of hands"". During the session, healing energy is channeled to the client to clear internal blockages and activate the flow of healing. We will journey to a place of deep healing through conscious breathing while being guided by Spirit. Reiki addresses physical illness, emotional and mental disorders and allows us to return to oneness with ourselves. 
The session will take place at my Sacred Space or we can meet virtually. Before the session, we will review how you can best prepare. I am looking forward to sharing this beautiful healing practice with you! 

And I say Ashé
Ashé is derived from the Yoruba word àse and is a Praise word used to Give Thanks. Ashé is the power behind all things in the universe. 
I am eternally grateful for your support. 
And so it is!

<p>The Scarlet Sage Herb Co. is transforming into a Wellness Venue, and we need you to be part of it! </p>

<p>We will be able to offer more transformative experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional Healing Arts and Divination intensives and workshops</li>
<li>Certifications in Western Herbal Medicine, Aromatherapy, and Indigenous Healing </li>

<p>After 18-plus years of working as a<br/>professional model for QVC and other outlets, my life and my health as I knew it ended. My last day there as a model, I fell to the ground while waiting to take before and after shots for a beauty show. I had what could only be described as a seizure. <br/>I felt poisoned, and in fact, I was poisoned. I had a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_injury"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">toxic injury</a> due to<br/>environmental chemicals that ravaged my body and struck down my immune system.</p>
<p>I was horrifically introduced to a new world and generation of 21st century diseases that modern medicine hasn't yet had the pleasure to meet. A world where toxic chemicals, unsafe pharmaceuticals, and the lack of air regulation in our schools and work environments are now giving birth to health issues that are unrecognizeable to traditional medicine. Welcome to my life. I hope you never come for a visit.</p>

<span style=""font-size: 16px;font-style: italic;line-height: 26px;font-weight: normal;""> I became intolerant to everything one would typically take for granted. The ability to drive by elecrical wires, power plants, being able to eat without having to subject myself to daily allergy shots and expensive supplements, and even wearing the clothing I wanted, because of synthetic materials, dyes and fire retardants.<p>                                            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1026486/files/20141118105705-l.jpg?1416337025"" src="""" style=""width: 191px;height: 257px;""/></p>Yes, I reacted to clothing because of chemicals, dyes and fire retardants they're made with. My immune system was so shattered that I couldn’t even put a cell phone up to my ear without feeling sharp stabbing pains from the radiation it emitted.

<p>My goal with this funding campaign is to<br/>finance help for my patient care at the Chung Institute of Integrative Medicine in<br/>Moorestown, New Jersey. There I will work with doctors that have successfully<br/>treated people with my injury. I will use funds to form a treatment plan to better my health. If I raise enough, I will move into a healthier and more controlled living environment that will help my health thrive. Secondly, I will continue to build and support <a href=""http://bodybyearth.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bodybyearth.com</a>, and bring <a href=""I%20was%20suffering%20from%20a%20loss%20of%20tolerance.%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">awareness</a> to all. </p>

<p> Bodybyearth, a much needed  business and career that will give me an opportunity to work in a safe  and controlled environment and keep me from relapses and setbacks. I purchased this domain years back after I personally experienced the negative impact  toxic chemicals in  beauty and skin care ingredients  had on my health. Bodybyearth.com is a shopping destination and educational website for<br/>safer but effective product options, and provide you and consumers around the<br/>world with real-life stories through video, photography, media and social<br/>platforms, beginning with my own story of how I became injured and disabled. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>While most people were beginning to run away from me because of my injury and illness, one person actually ran towards me. It was the president and CEO of <u></u><a href=""http://www.mindseyeconcepts.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mindseye Concepts,</a> Matt Mondzelewski. He recognized my need to work in a safe environment and generously built <a href=""http://bodybyearth.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>bodybyearth.com</u></a> and <a href=""http://unscented.me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>unscented.me</u></a> in<br/>support of my dream for a safe shopping destination. Most of all, he gave me hope at a time when I had none. He understood and believed in my dream of creating an online space where people can shop for safer products and learn all about the environmental injuries, illnesses and health impacts many consumer products, workplace and home environments are associated with and how they are impacting the health of many people not just in our country, but around the world.</p>
<br/>I fought to be normal and perhaps was in denial about being able to do things outside of my present circumstances. I relapsed many times and had even more setbacks. Now, I am ready to embrace my restrictions and pursue my dream. I hope I am cured someday, but now it's time for me to get help and to focus and plan for a future to work safely from home. I believe this is my lifes calling: <a href=""http://bodybyearth.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>bodybyearth.com</u></a> and <a href=""http://unscented.me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>unscented.me</u></a>. <br/>
<br/>Getting where I need to be health-wise may<br/><p>take a village, and with your help, I believe I will reach my goal and<br/>eventually live a healthier, happier life. My real job is to regain my health,<br/>my true spirit and my energy, but my passion is for all of you. To share<br/>everything that I have experienced and learned through my journey. I want you<br/>and your children to have the knowledge that grew from a place of suffering and<br/>ignorance. Most women, including myself, have blindly trusted many products<br/>that we as consumers use every day without knowing what is truly in them.</p>
<p>My past daily ritual included many products and ingredients that can be harmful to one’s health. As I look for safer, effective product options for myself, know that I am also searching for all of your daughters, sons and the entire family. Know that what I find for myself, I also find for you.</p>
My long-term goal is to help more people like myself and even more people like you to become aware. To help sensitive people that don’t even know they’re sensitive. People with chronic health conditions, autoimmune issues, cancer, and anyone really that may have no idea how their personal care, beauty and skincare could be impacting their present health situation. Help me live – help me to help you. Thank you for reading my story, and please share if you feel inspired to.<br/>

After 18-plus years of working as aprofessional model for QVC and other outlets, my life and my health as I knew it ended. My last day there as a model, I fell to the ground while waiting to take before and after shots for a beauty show. I had what could only be described as a seizure. I felt poisoned, and in fact, I was poisoned. I had a toxic injury due toenvironmental chemicals that ravaged my body and struck down my immune system.
I was horrifically introduced to a new world and generation of 21st century diseases that modern medicine hasn't yet had the pleasure to meet. A world where toxic chemicals, unsafe pharmaceuticals, and the lack of air regulation in our schools and work environments are now giving birth to health issues that are unrecognizeable to traditional medicine. Welcome to my life. I hope you never come for a visit.



An unbelievable journey of what it's like to live without an innate immune system.




 I became intolerant to everything one would typically take for granted. The ability to drive by elecrical wires, power plants, being able to eat without having to subject myself to daily allergy shots and expensive supplements, and even wearing the clothing I wanted, because of synthetic materials, dyes and fire retardants.                                            Yes, I reacted to clothing because of chemicals, dyes and fire retardants they're made with. My immune system was so shattered that I couldn’t even put a cell phone up to my ear without feeling sharp stabbing pains from the radiation it emitted. My body had lost its ability to protect me from environmental stimuli and irritants: A loss of tolerance. 



My goal with this funding campaign is tofinance help for my patient care at the Chung Institute of Integrative Medicine inMoorestown, New Jersey. There I will work with doctors that have successfullytreated people with my injury. I will use funds to form a treatment plan to better my health. If I raise enough, I will move into a healthier and more controlled living environment that will help my health thrive. Secondly, I will continue to build and support bodybyearth.com, and bring awareness to all. 

 Bodybyearth, a much needed  business and career that will give me an opportunity to work in a safe  and controlled environment and keep me from relapses and setbacks. I purchased this domain years back after I personally experienced the negative impact  toxic chemicals in  beauty and skin care ingredients  had on my health. Bodybyearth.com is a shopping destination and educational website forsafer but effective product options, and provide you and consumers around theworld with real-life stories through video, photography, media and socialplatforms, beginning with my own story of how I became injured and disabled. 

While most people were beginning to run away from me because of my injury and illness, one person actually ran towards me. It was the president and CEO of Mindseye Concepts, Matt Mondzelewski. He recognized my need to work in a safe environment and generously built bodybyearth.com and unscented.me insupport of my dream for a safe shopping destination. Most of all, he gave me hope at a time when I had none. He understood and believed in my dream of creating an online space where people can shop for safer products and learn all about the environmental injuries, illnesses and health impacts many consumer products, workplace and home environments are associated with and how they are impacting the health of many people not just in our country, but around the world.
I fought to be normal and perhaps was in denial about being able to do things outside of my present circumstances. I relapsed many times and had even more setbacks. Now, I am ready to embrace my restrictions and pursue my dream. I hope I am cured someday, but now it's time for me to get help and to focus and plan for a future to work safely from home. I believe this is my lifes calling: bodybyearth.com and unscented.me. 
Getting where I need to be health-wise maytake a village, and with your help, I believe I will reach my goal andeventually live a healthier, happier life. My real job is to regain my health,my true spirit and my energy, but my passion is for all of you. To shareeverything that I have experienced and learned through my journey. I want youand your children to have the knowledge that grew from a place of suffering andignorance. Most women, including myself, have blindly trusted many productsthat we as consumers use every day without knowing what is truly in them.
My past daily ritual included many products and ingredients that can be harmful to one’s health. As I look for safer, effective product options for myself, know that I am also searching for all of your daughters, sons and the entire family. Know that what I find for myself, I also find for you.
My long-term goal is to help more people like myself and even more people like you to become aware. To help sensitive people that don’t even know they’re sensitive. People with chronic health conditions, autoimmune issues, cancer, and anyone really that may have no idea how their personal care, beauty and skincare could be impacting their present health situation. Help me live – help me to help you. Thank you for reading my story, and please share if you feel inspired to.

<h3>My Project</h3>
<p>My name is Danielle Benjamin and I am a Black herbalist living and working in Northern California's Bay Area. I have been researching and creating medicine with plants, supporting the physiological and spiritual health of my two-year-old and our community for the past four years. It was through the experience of supporting my sister as her doula at my nephew's birth that I fully understood this was the right pivot for my work. I applied to Ancestral Apothecary's herbal medicine training program and was accepted!</p>
<p>In this 400 hour training, I will study with <a href=""https://ancestralapothecaryschool.com/teachers-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">frontline herbal masters</a> who are experts at the cutting edge of herbal medicine, and POC whose foundations as herbalists come from their own indigenous lineages with the plants. This is an incredible opportunity to train in the art, science &amp; spirituality of herbal medicine from a decolonized lens.</p>
<p>I will initially be developing my personal body of work by adding to my line of herbal offerings for my family &amp; community, and ultimately training to launch my own healing practice.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why support my project?</h3>
<p>While I've been awarded a partial scholarship for Cecemmana, this Indiegogo campaign will raise funds for the remaining cost of the program — including the instructional training and ancillary fees from the school. My goal is to raise $3,000 with your help.</p>
<p>$30 in support of this project will receive ETERNAL REWARDS FROM THE HEAVENS! and your choice of the following:</p>
<p><font>*A sweet, blissful h</font>erbal tea blend! You can brew it as a tea, sit back and sip sip, or add it to your bath and soak in the magic and medicine — both equally lovely experiences (created by me!)</p>
<p>*A beautiful aromatherapeutic bundle of herbs for smudging and sweetening the energy in your space! Made for the angels! (created by me!)</p>
<p>*A tarot or oracle reading with me! fun fun! (a $60-80 value, and something I'd quite honestly do for free — but we're fundraising here!)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
<p>The main goal for this project is to develop my personal body of work as an herbalist and to lay the groundwork to launch my own clinical healing practice. My vision is a storefront apothecary and sliding scale clinic.</p>
<p>I intend to offer affordable support for nourishing physical, mental and spiritual vibrancy in the Bay Area and beyond, all the more considering the cruelty and violence of our country's healthcare choices. As a Black woman, I am especially called to work with women of color and those at the intersections of the systemic diseases of racism and patriarchy.</p>
<p>I intend to:</p>
<ul>
<li>make holistic wellness accessible to low income communities</li>
<li>engage ancestral medicine and ancient ways</li>
<li>facilitate optimal well-being using functional nutrition, herbal therapies and vibrational healing modalities</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Unable to support monetarily? No problem!</h3>
<p>If you are unable to support with a pledge, your voice is an even greater help! Liking and/or sharing my campaign will be an enormous aid in making my project come to fruition. Even sending a message of encouragement means more than you know :) </p>

This helps to reduce cortisol levels associated with stress, and in turn increase dopamine and serotonin, our ""happy chemicals"". Kocoono™ is a natural self-soothing tool that helps users to have improved quality sleep, mood and relaxation, which in turn can have other overall health benefits.Other blankets have a set weight and cannot be changed.

<h3>Keep the Scottish brand!</h3>
<p>The big supermarkets in the UK (notably Tescos) have recently been replacing the Saltire on Scottish produce with a standard British (union) flag. With Brexit under way, this is perhaps understandable.</p>
<p><strong>BUT...</strong></p>
<p>Scottish produce has a global and growing reputation for quality and environmental standards. The Scottish Government has banned GM crops and fracking, further enhancing Scotland's reputation for quality and purity.</p>
<p><strong>Replacing the Scottish branding with a British flag is likely to <i>undermine </i>sales of Scottish produce rather than enhancing them!</strong></p>
<p>It's important that Scottish produce is clearly labelled with its origins to maintain its market-leading reputation.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.ayemail.scot"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ayeMail </a>is a not-for-profit organisation that promotes Scotland and the case for Scottish independence (although the latter is not part of this campaign). We exist to help other organisations campaign in Scotland's interests.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We want to print and distribute 100,000+ leaflets/flyers raising awareness of the quality and reputation of Scottish food. This is about maintaining the sales of our fish, beef, lamb, strawberries, potatoes, haggis, black pudding, whisky, gin, oatcakes, teacakes... and every other food &amp; drink product made or grown in Scotland.</p>
<p>The leaflets will be professionally designed and explain why it is so critically important to support our farmers and other businesses by keeping the Scottish Brand on our produce. The call to action on the leaflets will be to contact the supermarkets and ask them to reinstate (or in some cases keep) the Scottish branding on Scottish produce.</p>
<p>Distributing these leaflets in the last couple of weeks before Christmas will have the biggest impact as people are shopping for festive food and drink.</p>
<p>To be absolutely clear, we are <strong>NOT </strong>asking people to ""boycott"" produce with the British flag or produce originated elsewhere in the UK - and nor should we. This is purely about getting the supermarkets to keep the Scottish Brand on <i>Scottish </i>produce.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Is this about independence?</h3>
<p><strong>No. </strong>This issue transcends the constitutional question. This is about defending and supporting our food and drink industry at a time when it is already threatened by Brexit. It is crucial to protect Scotland's reputation for food and drink excellence if we are to protect jobs and exports.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://business.bankofscotland.co.uk/business-resource-centre/economic-and-market-insight/food-and-drink-report/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent Bank of Scotland survey </a>revealed that 67% of Scottish food and drink companies had changed their recruitment plans as a result of Brexit.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Delivery</h3>
<p>The National Yes Registry has established a network of Yes groups across Scotland, so we can use that to spread word, and we'll use the usual social media channels to raise broader public awareness.</p>
<p>The cartons of printed leaflets will be available for anybody to ""purchase"" (shipping costs only) through the ayeMail.scot store.</p>
<p>We're crowdfunding for the <i>printing </i>of the leaflets only. To actually deliver them, we'll have to ask groups and individuals to pay for the postage/courier fees (these will be nominal amounts compared to the value of leaflets shipped).</p>
<p>We'd like to distribute everything for free, but we don't think that it's right to crowdfund payments to couriers and/or the Post Office. We prefer every penny of donations to go to actual leaflet production. Since they get the leaflets for free, we think it's only fair to ask recipients to cover the postage.</p>
<p>Our time and effort is already covered. We're in this to help Scotland, not to make a profit, so you are funding the leaflet printing <u>only</u>. There are no staff costs and no profit margins to cover.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>There is one perk level where we'll send you 100 leaflets via post. After the ~10% crowdfunding fees, the bulk of the £15 goes to getting the leaflets mass-printed, with £2 covering the physical postage. Obviously, if you can spare a few quid more, that will help us towards our target!</p>
<p>Once the leaflets are printed, they will be available to <u>everybody</u>.</p>

Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you live a happier life as well.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn there are myths about what makes us happy, and there are simple ways to work on your wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li><p>identifying areas where you can improve the way you think</p></li>
<li><p>positively changing the structure of your brain through certain activities</p></li>
<li><p>learning advice from psychologists who specialize in working with challenges young LDS members face</p></li>
</ul><p>Every young person will benefit from this book, whether you are content but trying to live an even happier life, or if you are struggling with challenges and trying to get on solid ground.<br/><br/>With Firmness of Mind is a nonfiction book that speaks to young members of the church who are looking at improving their mental wellbeing from the perspective of the science of positive psychology.</p><p> </p><h3>The Book - With Firmness of Mind</h3><p><br/>The book is written in 3 parts:<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and a guide on how to use the book. You will learn that many people follow myths about happiness, and that science shows you can improve your happiness by focusing less on changing your circumstances and focusing more on changing your thinking. You will learn about how to change the structure of your brain using the science of neuroplasticity, and create a plan on how to implement specific activities in your life.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 2-5, which provide activities to improve your happiness and mental wellbeing in four different spheres of influence in your life. The first sphere is changing your brain through healthily managing your thoughts. The second sphere is supporting mental wellbeing through working on your body to maximize production of mood-boosting chemicals. The third sphere relates to your immediate relationships, which benefit both the happiness of yourself and your loved ones. The fourth sphere covers the community sphere, which discusses how you can overcome challenges that your community (church, school, group, etc.) presents you and use your community to both improve your mental wellbeing and help others in your community.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains the conclusion, which will help you tie all you learned together into a regular routine, and further sources to consult for more expert advice.</p><p> </p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p> </p><p>As I mentioned earlier, 100% of the book's profits will be donated to nonprofit organizations including The National Alliance on Mental Illness, The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, and Latter-day Saint Charities.</p><p><br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>

<p>Thank you for all support and help so far. Thank you for following us at our journey to the real home.</p>
<p>We have to focus first to settle down at the Park or at close friendly space, as we lost the beautiful farm we use to lease last three years. </p>
<p>We hope that you will choose to be part of SPIRIT’s miracle and to make this happen. With your donation, you are supporting a great cause and will provide a future for a life-changing program in our community.</p>
<p>Our crowdfunding project now is dedicated to the expenses related to moving into the Park - purchasing new barns, tractor, truck, trailer.<br/>Please share our story with your friends and family and continue to create a future for the SPIRIT Mission.</p>

</ul></div>","Dear Friends,
Thank you for all support and help so far. Thank you for following us at our journey to the real home.
We have to focus first to settle down at the Park or at close friendly space, as we lost the beautiful farm we use to lease last three years. 
We hope that you will choose to be part of SPIRIT’s miracle and to make this happen. With your donation, you are supporting a great cause and will provide a future for a life-changing program in our community.
Our crowdfunding project now is dedicated to the expenses related to moving into the Park - purchasing new barns, tractor, truck, trailer.Please share our story with your friends and family and continue to create a future for the SPIRIT Mission.
Thank you to everyone who has supported SPIRIT and our Home for SPIRIT Campaign.  Together, we can continue to provide healing and growth in our community! 
 
Spirit Open Equestrian Program, Inc.  
  
About SPIRIT
 
 
SPIRIT provides therapy, learning and improvement of life skills healing of the body, mind and spirit - using Equine-Assisted Activities.
 



SPIRIT has the power to change and improve the community by serving those with special needs as a much-needed source of therapeutic activities. The longer-term impact of SPIRIT is that it can help to improve basic life skills for youth populations and young adults. Horses used in therapy provide healing processes. Human interaction with them, as created by a well-trained and skilled instructor or therapist, can change the quality of life of the participant and his/her family. Raising generations of young people with a strong sense of respect, compassion, self-esteem, responsibility and good leadership skills are just a few of the benefits derived from the therapeutic service of horses.Our vision is to create a unique model for Equine Assisted Activities - therapies and education in urban areas such as the one we serve currently.



  
SPIRIT is a young but strong organization.  All our horses have been adopted from auctions or were generously and kindly donated to the program. 

We serve our community with over 3,000 lesson-hours a year. Our program has been supported by many volunteers who have given over 10,000 yearly volunteer hours to the program. 
 


In case we are unable to raise enough funds to cover a down payment for the purchase of the farm the funds can and will  be used to help SPIRIT to cover any future renting fees and relocation costs that might be incurred should we lose the lease on the farm land we currently occupy.

<h3>Help make SoCal's first cat lounge a wonderful place!</h3>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you not only help LA/OC's homeless cats but yourself too. ZenCat Lounge is about personal connections - the kind you build with feline companions and the kind you build with yourself. We give cats a better place to live while awaiting their forever home and give you an opportunity to relax, escape from the stress of your life for an hour, and get in touch with what really matters. At ZenCat Lounge you can take some time for yourself to listen to music, participate in guided or solo meditation, play with a cat or two, and give love to animals in need. Anyone who's ever held a purring kitty or watched a cat pounce on an unsuspecting toy mouse knows the unique joy cats bring to our lives. We want to give our community an opportunity to share that joy. Contribute today to support a space strongly needed by homeless cats and those of you with love to give.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why we need YOU</h3>
<p>The more money we raise, the better environment we can build and the sooner we can bring it to life! Your contributions will allow us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn blank walls into catification masterpieces with shelves, ramps, and mini gardens</li>
<li>Upgrade from Ikea furniture to much more comfortable pieces for you</li>
<li>Build luxurious cat towers so our cats can get plenty of exercise</li>
<li>Provide the best toys to stimulate our cats' minds</li>
<li>Rent the perfect space with enough room to house our goal of 20 cats plus cozy nooks for reading and meditating</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>How we benefit our community</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Shelter cat population</strong>: We will be a foster home for cats from a local shelter, which allows the shelter to save more cats and gives the cats we house a healthier environment to live in while waiting to be adopted, along with a better chance to find their forever home. The more humans they get to interact with, the friendlier they become, which makes them more likely to be adopted. And if you're looking to add a feline friend to your family, we provide a relaxed, no-pressure environment to get to know available cats and see their personalities in action so you can find the one that's the ""purrfect"" fit for you! </li>
<li>
<b>Cat lovers unable to have their own cat</b>: Get your kitty fix by spending time with ours.</li>
<li>
<strong>Everyone</strong>: Several studies have shown the health benefits that spending time and building relationships with animals has on <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22518240/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blood pressure</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11641292/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stress</a>, and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27931210"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mental health</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The health and well-being of our foster cats is our primary concern. Our cats will be allowed to roam the lounge freely and will always have access to food, water, and litter boxes. To avoid overwhelming them with crowds, we'll use an online reservation system and walk-ins will only be accepted if there are open reservations. Not being a cafe means we must charge a cover fee to enter the lounge. This will be our primary source of funding to pay for the cats' needs and keeping the doors open, but we anticipate additional income from special events and classes as well as offering a small, curated selection of cat products for sale.</p>

<h2><u>About the Shamiri Program</u></h2>
<p>The Shamiri Wellness Program is a <strong>low-cost, evidence-based intervention </strong>for adolescent depression and anxiety. To <strong><i>overcome stigma</i></strong>, it uses positive psychological principles. To <i><strong>overcome resource limitations</strong></i>, it uses lay-providers (local high-school graduates) and is held in schools. </p>
<h3>What’s the evidence that the Shamiri Program works?</h3>
<p>Last year, we tested the Shamiri Wellness Program with students in Kibera, the largest slum in Africa. When compared to a study-skills control group, the Shamiri Wellness Program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly<strong> reduced depression and anxiety symptoms</strong>.</li>
<li>Significantly <strong>improved academic performance</strong>.</li>
<li>Significantly <strong>improved social support from friendships</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Why give to Shamiri?</h3>
<p>Adolescent depression and anxiety are globally <strong>prevalent and harmful</strong>. In Kenya, young people face <strong>limited treatment options</strong> (there are fewer than 30 psychiatrists in Kenya) and <strong>significant social stigma</strong>. Most psychological disorders begin during adolescence and <strong>influence future life outcomes including income and physical health</strong>. </p>
<h3>Why are we raising money?</h3>
<p>This summer, we are testing an <strong>enhanced</strong> Shamiri Program with about 450 students in Kenya. This trial will allow us to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate the efficacy of a low-cost, easily accessible depression and anxiety treatment for kids who really need it.</li>
<li>Figure out for whom and under what circumstances the treatment works best.</li>
<li>Develop strong local relationships with schools, educators, students, and clinicians in Kenya.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><i>More about the program:</i></p>
<p><i>The main concepts of Shamiri are:</i></p>
<p><i>Growth: We target theories about the ability to improve over time, teaching students that personality traits, skills, and situations can be improved through effort and strategies.</i></p>
<p><i>Gratitude : Grateful people exhibit more positive experiences and outcomes. Students in the Shamiri program learn about gratitude and practice gratitude exercises.</i></p>
<p><i>Values and virtues : We work with students to identify and reflect on specific values that are most important to them. Such a self-reflection can improve individual coping skills by reestablishing an awareness of personal worth, goals, and integrity. </i></p>
<p><i>Students participating in the program meet every week for four-weeks. The one-hour group sessions are led by trained peers who act as lay-providers. </i></p>
<p><u><i>About the Shamiri Institute</i></u></p>
<p><i>The mission of the Shamiri Institute is to develop and deploy evidence-based interventions that improve the health, wellness, social, and academic outcomes of children and adolescents in East Africa. We envision extending our mission to Sub-Saharan Africa and similar regions around the world in the coming years. We seek to support research on, development of, and implementation of projects that can improve life outcomes for the economically disadvantaged. For more, visit: <a href=""http://shamiri.institute/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://shamiri.institute/</a></i></p>

<h3><strong>For years many of us have struggled with the idea that spirituality had to be ‘free’ and called out to the spiritual teachers of the world to either live a life of scarcity; live off their families; or get a job! </strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>“Many years ago, a man who came to my free classes came up to me and stretched out a bill. I said, no thank you. My classes are free. (I had a job).  He looked at me in dismay and sadness and said: ‘You have given me so much and I want to give you back.  I only have money. You have no right to deprive me of the happiness of giving what I have.’  I still didn´t take his money. I had doubts, fear, guilt.  It took years for me to learn this lesson. TO GIVE IS TO RECEIVE.  Thanks to all of you who have allowed me to give and to received. God blesses you all. </strong><strong><em>(ACIM Teacher)</em></strong>

<h3 align=""right"">Durante años, muchos de nosotros luchamos con la idea de que la espiritualidad tenía que ser ‘gratis’ y le pedíamos a los maestros espirituales del mundo que vivieran en escasez; vivieran de sus familias; o se buscaran un empleo!</h3>
<h3 align=""right"">“Hace años, un hombre que venía a mis clases gratuitas se me acercó y me alargó un billete- Le dije, no gracias. Mis clases son gratis. (Yo tenía un empleo). Me miró con sorpresa y tristeza y me dijo: ‘Me has dado tanto y quiero darte yo. Sólo tengo dinero. No tienes el derecho de privarme de la felicidad de dar lo que tengo.’ Aún así no tomé su dinero. Tenía dudas, miedo, culpa.  Me llevó años aprender esta lección.  DAR ES RECIBIR.  Gracias a todos los que me han permitido dar y recibir.  Dios bendice a todos. <em>(Maestro de UCDM)</em> </h3>

ASKING MAKES US VULNERABLE

For years many of us have struggled with the idea that spirituality had to be ‘free’ and called out to the spiritual teachers of the world to either live a life of scarcity; live off their families; or get a job! 

“Many years ago, a man who came to my free classes came up to me and stretched out a bill. I said, no thank you. My classes are free. (I had a job).  He looked at me in dismay and sadness and said: ‘You have given me so much and I want to give you back.  I only have money. You have no right to deprive me of the happiness of giving what I have.’  I still didn´t take his money. I had doubts, fear, guilt.  It took years for me to learn this lesson. TO GIVE IS TO RECEIVE.  Thanks to all of you who have allowed me to give and to received. God blesses you all. (ACIM Teacher)

Today, more than asking  …. We are inviting you to participate in our campaign:  
“BRINGING THE TEACHERS”. 
Please watch the inspiring video below and Keep on Reading for the ‘HOW’ you can help.


 


* Esta campaña ha concluido, pero si quiere DONAR, por favor escríbenos a indiegogo@ibizaenlightfestival.com
PEDIR NOS HACE VULNERABLES
Durante años, muchos de nosotros luchamos con la idea de que la espiritualidad tenía que ser ‘gratis’ y le pedíamos a los maestros espirituales del mundo que vivieran en escasez; vivieran de sus familias; o se buscaran un empleo!
“Hace años, un hombre que venía a mis clases gratuitas se me acercó y me alargó un billete- Le dije, no gracias. Mis clases son gratis. (Yo tenía un empleo). Me miró con sorpresa y tristeza y me dijo: ‘Me has dado tanto y quiero darte yo. Sólo tengo dinero. No tienes el derecho de privarme de la felicidad de dar lo que tengo.’ Aún así no tomé su dinero. Tenía dudas, miedo, culpa.  Me llevó años aprender esta lección.  DAR ES RECIBIR.  Gracias a todos los que me han permitido dar y recibir.  Dios bendice a todos. (Maestro de UCDM) 
Hoy, más que pedirte …. Queremos invitarte a participar de nuestro proyecto: 
“TRAYENDO LOS MAESTROS”

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Re-Generation has evolved to become the main mission of Re-Green while working with nature since 2012. We walk in a Permaculture way, eat Real Food, build Nature friendly Structures and trust Holistic Healing  Re-Green is our home and farm together with an Experiential -Educational Retreat Center. Every year we host more and more guests from all over the globe to find information, interaction, time to retreat and re-discover how healing and important it is to care for the Earth and ourselves. The need of more food increases dramatically!</p>
<p>Our intention is to offer all visitors home grown organic food, that they can see, touch, smell and taste, Understanding the nourishment and growth from the 'earth to belly.' This versatile Keder greenhouse that we are crowd funding for, with its “Twin Skinned” UV resistant covering, is guaranteed for 20 years and has many benefits that fit with our strategy of being self-supportive in our vegetable food production.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this dream possible we have managed to get a special discounted price for a Keder Greenhouse of 6950 euros ( 8500 USD) that we are trying to raise and assure you that we will greatly value all donations.</p>
<p>We ask for your collaboration so that all who visit Re-Green can experience the power of growing and eating home grown organic healthy nutritional tasty food and to give the gift of empowering yourself and others to care for the earth and organic nourishment.</p>
<p>Yet as permaculture tells us to 'creatively use and respond to change', should we not meet the target set, we can find a smaller solution. Still we reach out to you to help with our ideal goal and offer gratitude in the form of perks that you can find here on the side.</p>
<p>Mill Millichap our Permaculture teacher has agreed to use his  tree<br/>nursery's Triodos Bank (ethical bank) account for our international<br/>fundraising . </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why a greenhouse?</p>
<p>It is nowadays becoming more well known and all different nutritional approaches agree that “every meal that we eat should consist of at least 2/3 of vegetables”. The importance of this fact has been incorporated in our kitchen in order to provide our guests and residents the best possible nutrition. This fact however, creates the necessity for re-green to grow “7 tons of vegetables a year” a number that could not be achieved until today due to the small spring-summer season. In order to achieve our veggie growth quantities, the cultivation of greens during the cold season must be increased and the only way that this can be achieved is by a good size green house. Having carefully done our research we have concluded that amongst the greenhouses in the market the “Keder” suits our situation and needs better than any other.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.kedergreenhouse.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kedergreenhouse.co.uk</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is our first crowndfunding project, as we don't tend to be so commercial, reusing, repairing, refusing in the first place. Yet some carefully selected, sustainable and long life expenses are necessary to be brought into our lives. We assure you that we will greatly value and honour all donations. </p>

<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to view my campaign! </p>
<p>My name is Samantha Okumura and I am a yoga teacher in Las Vegas, NV. Shortly after graduating college, I accepted an internship working for a nonprofit organization that offered adaptive exercise therapy to individuals who have suffered a spinal cord injury. From that moment I knew that I would pursue a career working with neurological injuries. I didn't know at the time how underserved this community was or how difficult it was to find affordable, long-term, post-acute therapy that is so critical to maintaining overall health in the body post-injury. This studio is my humble attempt to provide an affordable recreational therapy, a healing atmosphere and a space to build community. </p>
<p>Many individuals who suffer from paralysis, multiple sclerosis, or other neurological disorders/injuries experience high tone and spasticity in the muscles, decreased bone mineral density, chronic nerve pain, weak diaphragms (weak breath), poor circulation/ability to regulate blood pressure, overall disconnectedness to the body, depression and anxiety, as well as the negative consequences of spending a lot of time in a seated position. Yoga therapy (modified asana (postures), pranayama (breath work), and meditation) is a beautiful complement or addition to other physical therapy. We work one on one to maintain mobility and flexibility in the joints and spine, build posture and core strength, improve breath control, and calm the mind and spirit while building better awareness and connectedness to the body. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I truly believe that the benefits of yoga should be accessible to everyone and are not only life-changing but critical to physical, mental and spiritual well being. This campaign is a small drop in the bucket to empowering this community but has the potential to provide a much needed space for healing. The SCI community is terribly underserved. Not only is it difficult to get the bare minimum of what they need for daily living (which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and up to a million dollars the first year post-injury) but the majority of post-acute rehabilitation and therapy is not covered by medical insurance even though it is absolutely critical and irreplaceable in maintaining  health.  </p>
<p>I'm am setting my goal at $10,000 but I would be beyond grateful for any amount. This money will go directly to the cost to open and appropriately furnish a healing yoga space in Las Vegas, NV and more specifically to:</p>
<p>- flooring and paint </p>
<p>- wall mirrors </p>
<p>- specialized adaptive equipment for grip strength </p>
<p>- therapy tables for those that can't transfer to and from the floor </p>
<p>- stall bars </p>
<p>- pulley system and resistance band systems </p>
<p>- yoga blocks, mats, bolsters, straps, and wedges</p>
<p>- other adaptive tools</p>
<p>- organic cleaning supplies</p>
<p>Anything that is left over will go directly to free sessions to a fixed income individual with a cervical level injury resulting in paralysis from the shoulders down. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am beyond grateful for any donation but that's not all you can do to help. Simply spreading the word by sharing this campaign on your social media accounts may allow this campaign to reach an individual who truly needs this service and feels that there are no resources available to them. </p>

I am a therapist and an educator. I want to increase awareness about what we can do about stress in Managua, Nicaragua. Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere. People suffer from poverty, physical and emotional violence, gender inequality and lack of affection and quality time in the family. This results in high stress, anxiety, and physical problems. I want to do all I can and add to the growing network of healers and teachers working on this important social issue.What is this about? Why do I need money?Interest in the healing arts is growing globally. People are looking to understand stress and how to overcome anxiety. Power Brain Wellness Education is an integral health program involving action to combat the roots of stress coupled with physical fitness which promotes creative intellectual activity. Power Brain Wellness Education blends current neuroscience concepts with exercises and activities that awaken the body and brain. It provides a wealth of positive messages and focuses on interpersonal relationships; helping students awaken their natural intelligences. The program targets the vital role of teachers' positive frame of mind and pushes for a collaborative teaching atmosphere.  I am asking for your help to fund my training as a Power Brain Wellness Educator and provide books and materials for students.Who do work with?I use massage therapy and yoga classes with leaders of community service organizations who are stressed and need more self care. I also work as a yoga teacher for children and teens, introducing movement and mindfulness in after-school programming. Participants, including parents, report finding enhanced clarity, focus, inner peace and self-awareness through the classes they receive. This program will certify me to further my scope to help others as a Power Brain Educator. I will begin interweaving Power Brain Education and Wellness into my current services as well as new courses, workshops and retreats. Currently my services include:> Massage therapy > After school yoga classes and healing instruction for students ages 6-16> Community group yoga classes> Stress relief workshops for businesses leaders and empoyeesTo learn more details about Power Brain Wellness Education, I recommend reading about it here: http://www.powerbraineducation.comWhile mindfulness and wellness practices are being assimilated with enthusiasm in the U.S., they are just up-and-coming in Nicaragua. Expenses are high and money is tight.

will help so many more people receive the amazing benefits of warm water

<p>As an Adaptive Physical Educator, and Director of Easter Seals Community Based Programs for 18+ years, Cameron attuned her skills and her passion for seeing the potential of clients being in warm water.  Spanning from mild Arthritis, minor surgeries to major special needs such as Cerebral Palsy, amputation, Stroke and Parkinson’s. </p>
<p>“Seeing the postures and pain of clients that come in with intense pain and movement issues, then their faces and even smiles as they leave, has been my biggest teacher and inspiration.“</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
</div><p>This campaign is to raise money for an Aquatic Lift so we who work at the AquaZen Center can service our Special Needs client’s in safety and with ease of entry and exit from our pool environment. </p><p>At this time our 13 X 17 foot above ground pool is located in an area where there is some degree of difficulty walking down to the pool, from where a car is parked.  Once on the deck entry into the pool is steep for anyone suffering from any problems with knees, hips or back.</p><p>The Aquazen Center, besides the day to day services we provide clients,  are committed to a once a month Free Clinic, that services any one who has financial or physical needs. </p><p>Another one of our projects here at the Aquatic Integration Institute is to work with the Wounded Warrior’s, men and woman returning from the war with Post Tramatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  The lift will enable those who have difficulty in walking a safe way to enter and exit the pool.</p><p></p><p></p><blockquote> <b>Our goal in purchasing the lift will be to provide safety and have a broader ability to service a larger population of clients needing Aquatic Therapy</b>.</blockquote><p><b>Your contribution</b> will help us to achieve this goal, and be a service to the many who will now be able to receive aquatic therapy.  </p><div>
<h4>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h4>
<p>The Aquatic Integration Institute is a privately funded and owned entity.  It’s daily costs and pool maintenance are privately paid for, its revenue earned is minimal.</p>
<p><b>So that we can purchase the Aquatic Lift we are asking for help.</b></p>
<p>We need $5,000 to purchase and install an aquatic lift.  Our goal is simple in that all the $ raised will go directly for the lift, if the $5,000 is not raised whatever $ is still needed to complete the purchase the Institute will cover the balance. </p>
<p>All monies that are gifted are tax deductible and so a receipt will be sent to everyone participating in the fundraiser. </p>
<p></p>
<h4>The Impact</h4>
<p>The impact that this lift will give to our Central Coast Community (especially North County) will be both large and significantly small. </p>
<p>The Institutes purpose is to provide Aquatic Therapy to all peoples.  Those that can afford the therapy and to those who cannot..  So your contribution will be felt on the larger scale by the population of people who cannot get services either because of finances and or because of physical restrictions.</p>
<p>And on a smaller scale to those who can afford treatment but need a safe and easier access getting into the pool. </p>
<p>Please think about all the people you know, friends and family members that you would like to invite to a pool, and know that your contribution will make this easier for those that may have not been able to attend due to safe access. </p>
<p></p>
<h4>Risks &amp; Challenges</h4>
<p>The risk to this fundraiser is non- existent.  This is not a money-making proposal, this is a service oriented project.  The only challenges and risks so far have been that clients who come to the pool have had to walk down quite a ways from their car to the pool over terrain that compromises someone who has balance and coordination issues.  This fundraisers goal is to create a better risk, challenge free environment for access. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We so appreciate every one of you that has gotten this far in reading our proposal.  Please know that you can help as well even if money is not what your able to give now.  If you can send on this invitation to anyone you know or can think of that may know someone that may know someone.  Please spread the word.  The more the word spreads, the more likely we will be able to install a lift to service those with special needs.</p>
<p>You can go to the indiegogo share tools and easily send our invite out to as many people as you wish. </p>
<p>Again our Warmest Thanks for your support ~~~ Cameron West, Aquatic Integration Institute</p>

The risk to this fundraiser is non- existent.  This is not a money-making proposal, this is a service oriented project.  The only challenges and risks so far have been that clients who come to the pool have had to walk down quite a ways from their car to the pool over terrain that compromises someone who has balance and coordination issues.  This fundraisers goal is to create a better risk, challenge free environment for access. 

Other Ways You Can Help

We so appreciate every one of you that has gotten this far in reading our proposal.  Please know that you can help as well even if money is not what your able to give now.  If you can send on this invitation to anyone you know or can think of that may know someone that may know someone.  Please spread the word.  The more the word spreads, the more likely we will be able to install a lift to service those with special needs.
You can go to the indiegogo share tools and easily send our invite out to as many people as you wish.

<p>With Lisa-marie's business acumen and Marco's unique application of art and science, collectively they are anxious to usher in a new ""brand of wellness.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Round One!!</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>This <i>1st<sup>  </sup>Fundraising Campaign</i> is essential to the growth of <i>Critical One's</i> overall project and facility expansion.  Over the past several years <i>Critical One Laboratory</i> has been funded by the liquidation of personal assets which has provided them with the capital to develop this very important research and proprietary extraction processes and clinical Nutraceutical protocols.   Now, The <i>Arsenceic Foundation</i>, in keeping with its mission statement, has repositioned it's efforts to assist in the funding of this eminent work. It is with your generous donations that The <i>Arsenceic Foundation</i> will be able to continue to assist <i>Critical One</i> with future funding of clinical trials and additional equipment purchases.</p>
<p> </p>
</li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">So check this out....we can make this super simple for you AND improve YOUR health at the same time.    If you were to give up 3 Venti Pumpkin Spice Latte's a week for 2 months you could save yourself 11,280 calories, 1,488 grams of sugar and 360 grams of fat AND you could hand over $126.00 to us so that we can put it to use saving lives.  So...not only are you taking care of your health, but you are helping to purchase equipment that could literally save a life and perhaps...many!   </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">(And make sure to look very closely at this photo....it will seriously freak you out!)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508532029/czp0oyduhjg4knd3flqm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The Critical One</i> <i>Laboratory</i> has already seen tremendous results with its proprietary hybridized adiabatic extraction process and clinical Nutraceutical protocols.  The full spectrum biomatrix extracts have shown increased biovailability and intercellular residency by enhancing secondary and tertiary metabolites unique to this groundbreaking extraction process. <i>Along with Vita Cucina Nutraceutical Kitchen and Production Facility</i>, they're ready to take this to the next level. They desperately need your support to purchase the additional analytical equipment, production equipment, expanded Ultra-Organic Grow facilities and additional personnel. </p>
<p>This funding is vitally important for all of those who have been dropped by the mainstream medical community and who are struggling with a health issue.  We all deserve to have access to “healthy alternatives to wellness”.  Help us, help you and others!!  Good health isn’t a corporately granted privilege … it’s a birthright!</p>
<p>So what do you say?  Many hands make for light work and <i>The Critical One</i> <i>Laboratory </i>needs your contribution so that they can continue their formal Nutraceutical research into processes, procedures and protocols to determine efficacy, potency and assurance.  With the Holidays upon us there is no better way to show your love for others than making a donation in their name.  Please donate to the <i>Arsenceic Foundation</i> generously. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If the <i>Arsenceic Foundation</i> is able to raise all of the badly needed funding<i>, </i><i>The Critical One Laboratory </i>has an ultimate “wish list”.    However,  in the event that only some of the money is raised, there is a multi-phase plan that will enable <i>Critical One</i> to move forward with the “most pressing items”, putting out the proverbial “fires” in order of importance.</p>
<p>There are some initial ""must haves"" for the laboratory that are very expensive, but will help with further research and enable the scientists to be more time efficient.  Testing equipment and additional extraction equipment along with scalable production equipment are just a small part of the requisite aparatus required for expansion.</p>
<p>For the <i>Vita Cucina</i> Industrial kitchen and production facility, much of the equipment has already been purchased but as the product line grows, there is a need to increase the scope of the facility.  Additional refrigeration, warmers, blenders and juicers are among some of the additional items required. </p> <p style=""text-align: center;"">In order for the <i>Critical One</i> Laboratory to take the next step forward, acquiring a High Powered Liquid Chromatography or HPLC is mandatory.....this particular piece of equipment is essential when challenging the pharmaceutical industry and showing the nutracokinetic efficacy of this important work. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Along with additional part time administrative personnel, a full time analytical chemist is a necessary addition to our existing research staff. A fully functioning proprietary website, full of helpful information, articles, recipes and protocols, easily accessed in a library format is also key to truly helping people with life threatening and chronic health conditions.  There is a wonderful Facebook community, numbering in the thousands, that has already been created, however, a freelance web designer is needed to help with website development and maintenance. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">And finally, the <i>""really big dream""</i> is a <strong>Full Functioning</strong> <strong>Wellness Center</strong>.  Yes!  A place where an individual can come and learn how to change up their lifestyle to support a healthier way of living by awakening and supporting a full, mind, body, spirit, wellness approach.  The <i>Vita Cucina Nutraceutical Kitchen </i> would be <i>expanded into </i>a teaching facility helping people learn how to cook nourishing foods, easily.  This wellness center would have individual healing ""yurts"" where one can come, stay and be surrounded by the beauty of nature, take walks, meditate....heal.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The question that is frequently asked is, “What do I get for my donation”? Well, currently we don’t have the significant financial resources to create a ton of “Give-Away” items. These items are expensive to create. The <i>Arsenceic Foundation</i> wants all of the money to go into research, no perks or frills.   That being said...we have decided that for larger donations we are going to offer a T-shirt that reflects the theme of the campaign and will be featured in the ""perks"" section here.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">But the <strong>BIGGEST</strong> gift is the knowledge that you are helping a small group of fanatically passionate visionaries who can imagine a world where all <i>wellness is achieved with food!</i> “That” is what you get for your donation. Like Thomas Edison once said, “The Doctors of the future will give no medicine but instead care for the human frame with diet and in the cause and prevention of disease”.

<p> … Besides, do you really need another cheap pen or t-shirt that will serve as your next car towel?  Ummmm … we didn’t think so!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So to wrap it all up.  Every single one of us has a vested interest in healthcare.  None of us is immune to dis-ease, chronic health conditions or an overall lack of wellness.  We are surrounded by some very humbling statistics that seem to worsen every ... single ... day. </p>
<p>This year alone, 15,270 children will be diagnosed with cancer and 1,790 will die.</p>

In order to do so, this organisation operates a fitness center three days a week in a room of Verdun’s Marcel-Giroux community center. Members of our gym are welcome to workout at any time of the day, and are greeted by a kinesiologist, who offers them a training plan. Having a kinesiologist, an expert in physical activity, is part of Bouger et Vivre’s mandate to provide safe and high quality services to its members. The kinesiologist thus demonstrates proper movements, encourages those coming to workout, and teaches members how to move despite congenital or acquired physical limitations.Since accessibility is at the core of Bouger et Vivre’s mandate, it is impossible for us to require members to buy expensive memberships. Therefore, we are asking for your help so we can stay open in 2018 and pay our kinesiologist on staff for the next year. Your donations are of the utmost importance to us, and we hope to have your support. Be sure to check out the rewards to our donors!For more information, you can check out our website at http://bougervivre.weebly.com (french only so far) or come visit our Facebook page @BougerEtVivre.Thank you for your consideration,Monique TrudelFounder and president of the boardBouger et Vivre",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
