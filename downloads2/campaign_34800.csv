<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>Some of you may have read Chris's  <a href=""http://growmovement.blogspot.co.uk/?view=sidebar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog </a>about us serving as European Union election monitors in Sierra Leone last month and the extraordinary story of our teammate Issac, which you can read below.</p>
<p>Issac has gone from suffering unimaginably in the civil war to being half way through law school to serve his country as a human rights lawyer. Issac needs to raise $2,000 to fund this years fees by 17th December, and has already raised $300 from supporters in his local community.</p>
<p>We have committed to Issac that we will fundraise a scholarship of the remaining $1,700 from ourselves and our friends because we believe his example of perservance, positivity and public service in the face of extreme persecution is truly remarkable.</p>
<p>Issac has answered the John F Kennedy challenge of ""Ask not what your country will do for you, ask what you can do for your country"" under the most trying of circumstances and is quite simply the most inspirational person we have ever met.</p>
<p>We can think of no worthier receipient of educational scholarship.</p>
<p>So if you would like to give to something uniquely special this Christmas please join us in funding Issac's scholarship to enable him to realise his dream of serving the cause of justice and peace in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p><br/>We would also be very grateful if you shared this on your facebook page.</p>

<p>The tribal chief said “we pray for peaceful elections because we have seen it all.” They had. 11 years of war, 50,000 dead, amputations, rape, forced cannibalism. Waged by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) until 2001 on the people of Sierra Leone using child soldiers and conflict diamonds.</p>
<p>It was my first day in the field as a European Union election observer monitoring the 2012 Presidential elections. As the third elections since the end of the war, many commentators considered peaceful elections would mark Sierra Leone’s transition from a post conflict to more normal developing country, albeit the second poorest in the world. Elections have a raw emotional significance for Sierra Leonians: the RUF cut off people’s arms as punishment for voting. We met some of these amputees while investigating electoral access for vulnerable groups. There was something unbelievably shocking about it: That these people were missing arms not from injuries sustained in battle, but a deliberate act of torture from one human being to another. It is almost impossible to imagine the horror they went through, but I believe one should make the attempt so to understand that people face this injustice and it must be stopped.</p>
<p>Few people bought up the subject of the war but our assistant Issac did. He told us about running through a field with his father aged twelve. RUF bullets were thumping the soil around them. He shouted at his father to get down but Issac was injured, breaking his hip. Eventually they escaped into hiding but were unable to find enough food. His father starved to death.</p>
<p>Issac’s hip never healed correctly and he is unlikely to ever be able to afford the surgery to reset it. His mother died when he was much younger and as an only child it is easy to imagine him succumbing or becoming one more brutalised child soldier.</p>
<p>Instead, his father’s best friend took care of him and he went to secondary school. Issac’s father was a subsistence farmer and the family had no history of education but somehow Issac dreamt of becoming a human rights lawyer.  He passed the exam to get into university and started cold calling senior members of his community, telling them his story, his dream and asking for donations for his fees. A year later he had enough money for his first year.</p>
<p>Today Issac is a 24 year old top student with a linguistics degree and is half way through law school. He still depends on his community for support and is currently fundraising the $4,000 he needs for the final two years. He told me he wants to be a human rights lawyer to ensure no one suffers as he did and stand up against injustice in Sierra Leone. Perhaps he seeks release from his own anger in healing the hurt of others.</p>
<p>Thankfully the elections did pass peacefully and as international monitors our team was proud to play a role in enhancing Sierra Leonian’s confidence in the election process.</p>
<p>But if there is one reason why I’m optimistic about least developed countries escaping poverty it’s because I know their communities have extraordinary people like Issac who do not accept their situation, expand their sense of the possible, and lead.</p>

<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>Sports have always been a passion of mine. I have participated in many sports since I could walk, including cross-country running, soccer, swimming, basket-ball, badminton, volley-ball, track and field, and hockey. When I tried out Nordic skiing in grade 9, I thought that this was the hardest sport I had ever tried because it relied on the athlete being physically fit in not only a cardiovascular way, but in physical strength, endurance, balance as well as being mentally tough. I was instantly drawn to cross country skiing and joined the Arrowhead Nordic team the next year.</p>
<p>          By grade 11, I started really wondering what I was going to do with my future. It was then that I decided to become a professional athlete. The following year I got compartment syndrome in both legs, which left me unable to use them properly for skiing. I persevered none the less and came 16<sup>th</sup> at the Ontario High school championships, using mostly my upper body. This gave me the confidence I needed to believe that I had what it takes to compete on an international level and to one day represent Canada in the Olympics.</p>
<p>          I had a successful surgery in the spring of 2011, and since then I have been training to become the best I can be as a cross country skier. This year I have joined the Southern Ontario Training Centre (SOTC), with the strict guidance of a great coach. This is no longer High School racing and the cost is one that my family and I cannot afford. Travelling around the country, combined with equipment costs, racing fees, the SOTC program and tuition for university, all add up quickly, which is why I am in need of support.</p>
<p>I appreciate the time you have taken to consider my goal,</p>

<p>What is the Southern Ontario Training Centre?</p>
<p>SOTC is a high performance cross country ski training centre located near Barrie, ON, where, under the guidance of a full-time professional coach, athletes from across Ontario pursue excellence in competitive cross country skiing. Our mission is to help Ontario athletes achieve their dreams of representing Canada at the international level of the sport, while pursuing post-secondary education if they choose. SOTC athletes train together on a year round basis while representing their home clubs at provincial, national and continental competitions.

We focus on designing low cost buildings within the migrant community on the border between Thailand and Myanmar. </p> <p>
</p>
<p>In early 2012 we designed and constructed five student dormitories to house Burmese students at the Mae
Tao Clinic training campus. Sadly on the 25th of February 2015 a fire from a neighbouring famers land spiralled out of control and destroyed all five buildings.</p>
<p>
Fortunately of the 63 students living at the dormitories, no one was
seriously hurt and only two boys suffered minor injuries, which were quickly
treated at the Mae Tao Clinic. However the students now have nowhere to live
and many of them lost all of their belongings.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Every baht counts</h3> <p>The dormitories were designed so that they could be easily dismantled and reconstructed at a very low cost, without wasting materials. In the coming months they were due to be relocated on a neighbouring site as part of the new Mae Tao Clinic project, which itself is funded by charitable donations. </p>
<p>However following the fire none of the materials remain therefore the dormitories will need to be constructed completely from scratch and there just aren't the funds available to do this. </p>
<p>Our initial goal is to raise enough money to rebuild at least one of the dormitory buildings. For the future Mae Tao Clinic is aiming to build a permanent dormitory building which we will support with the rest of the donations. If we aren't able to achieve this, any money we do raise could be used toward renting accommodation for the students or helping to replace belongings. </p>
<p>Obviously it would be great to raise more than the target amount, as any additional funds could be used toward the construction and materials for the rest of the dormitories. But for now we are just taking it one step at a time. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Please be patient with us</h3>
<div>If and/or when we have the funds, we will start construction work as quickly as possible but as anyone who has been involved with a construction project knows, a lot preparation needs to be done before the actual building starts.</div>

way: they are all undocumented. Banned from the top five public universities in
their anti-immigrant home state of Georgia, Smith seems to them a breath of
fresh air. However, their chances of admission to Smith are much lower than for
documented American students with otherwise similar applications. <b>When applying
to Smith, undocumented students are currently considered part of the
international applicant pool, which is twice as competitive as the domestic
pool. </b>This process is explicitly need-conscious, which means that an
applicant’s ability to pay plays a role in the admission decision. Undocumented
applicants, many of whom have grown up in under-resourced U.S. communities,
must compete with wealthy international students who have often had access to
elite schools and extensive resume building opportunities. Additionally, while
domestic students are not required to submit SAT/ACT scores (the results of
which have been shown to correlate with income), international students are not
exempt, resulting in another hurdle for prospective students who lack legal
status. Smith's domestic admission rate is about 40%, but as international
students with high financial need, undocumented applicants face an admit rate
of approximately 10%. At the same time, undocumented students are not eligible for
federal grants or student loans. <b>In other words, undocumented students with few financial
resources face patently unfair barriers to attending Smith.</b></p>
<p>Top schools like Harvard, Dartmouth, Stanford, Duke, Notre
Dame, Oberlin, and the University of Chicago now recognize that undocumented
access to college is a pressing ethical and civil rights issue, and have
changed their policies and funding priorities. Many of these institutions
explicitly welcome applications from undocumented students and are committed to
using institutional funds to meet the financial need of those admitted. Other
schools, like Harvard, have pledged not to use citizenship status as a factor
in admissions decisions. While regressive legislation in states like Georgia
and Arizona tell undocumented youth that they are only fit for low-wage jobs,
these leading schools send the message that these young people deserve access
to institutions of higher learning. <b>As alumnae, we believe it's time for Smith

<p>The organizers of this campaign invite fellow alumnae, as

Smith. Our current goal is $10,000 <i>(the extra $400 is to cover Indiegogo's 4% fee.) </i> While we know this is a long way from what
it would cost to fund a Smith education for even one year, we want to show the

qualified undocumented student who otherwise would not be granted admission.</p>

<p>We are Northern Clay Center, a fabulous not-for-profit ceramic art
center in south Minneapolis, Minnesota. Since 1999, our original <i>ClayMobile </i>has reached offsite audiences across the state, transported 100,000+ clay art pieces to and from our outreach partners, and it has toured dozens of NCC exhibitions across the state and the country. The vehicle is nearing retirement age and a new, more environmentally friendly cargo van will allow us to increase offsite programming and satellite exhibitions. </p>

<h3>About Northern Clay Center and <i>ClayToGo</i>
</h3>
<p>Northern Clay Center is entering our 26<sup>th</sup> year of operations, and, since our start, we’ve become an established part of the local arts community and we have garnered national recognition for the quality and scope of our programs. The Clay Center is the only comprehensive ceramic arts organization in the region and is one of the largest, if not the largest, such
organization in the country. We have become a model for other medium-based
education and artist service organizations.</p>
<p>NCC’s <b><i>ClayToGo</i></b> programs (for schools and community groups) are produced in partnership with Twin Cities schools and other arts organizations. ART@HAND is a subsidiary program of <i><b>ClayToGo</b></i>, which serves adults 55+ in a variety of settings (at NCC, in nursing homes and care centers, at independent living centers, etc.) We provide short visits and extended artist residencies through these programs using our original <i>ClayMobile</i>; we host tours and artist demonstrations for groups (corporate employees, students, civic groups, birthday parties, etc.); and we lead hands-on, public programs during neighborhood festivals and other arts conferences. </p>

<p>Since 1999, the original <i>ClayMobile</i>—a retrofitted cube truck originally purchased and outfitted to move the heavy and cumbersome equipment required to work with clay—has reached offsite audiences across the state, and transported over <b>100,000 clay art pieces</b> to and from our outreach partners.

<p>We’ve toured the original <i>ClayMobile</i> throughout the state of Minnesota for traveling exhibitions and offsite ceramic sales, some of which are in collaboration with other art centers or museums.

Handheld places an emphasis on working with underrepresented, marginalized communities where planning a secure and stable future is compromised by political, social or economic circumstances.</p>
<p>Handheld Stories provides the equipment, the volunteers, and the curriculum for a wholesale video training experience. At the culmination of these workshops, Handheld trainees have acquired the skills necessary for semi-professional video production and broadcast.</p>
<p>Dharavi Slum, located in the heart of Mumbai, is home to nearly 1 million people living in an area roughly 1 square mile in size. That’s about 18,000 people per acre, and many exist with no running water, electricity health care or educational opportunities. By contributing to this project you are accomplishing 2 important goals, you will be providing a unique educational opportunity out of the reach of many of these children as well as bringing to light the situation in Dharavi as told by the kids who live there.</p>

<p> Do you see now, after watching it, how it is possible to care for communities and orphans without government money or ongoing donations? </p>
<p>The <strong><em>Sustainable Communities of Families Adopting Children</em></strong> are designed to do just that. <strong>Helping people to help themselves</strong>.</p>
<p>This project started after adopting two older children (10 and 12) from a traditional orphanage in Mexico, then over the next five years, taking them to visit the friends they had grown up with (who were still without families), <strong>I saw, with my own eyes, an amazing  development gap begin to form.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>I saw the difference adoption, parents and a home can make in the lives of orphans.</strong></h3>
<h3>That development gap and knowing the terrible conditions in which many orphans live, caused me to ask,</h3>
<h3><em>""How can we get more orphans adopted into real families?""</em></h3>
<p><em>A new nonprofit was formed and since then, over 600 volunteers from 18 different countries have contributed ideas for the design of <strong>Sustainable Adoption Communities</strong>!</em></p>

<p>and many more organizations and individuals helping to create this opportunity for the children.</p>
<p><strong>We have the design, now we need the land on which to build it</strong>.</p>
<p>As you saw in the video, this project will create a self-sustaining community of families adopting children.  It will not need any government money or ongoing donations!  The ""economic engine"" businesses in the community will make this possible. All the profits from the businesses stay in the project mission to keep the community operating.  Some of the funds will also be used to help start more sustainable communities around the world. The businesses create over 100 jobs, skills training for adolescents, food and the profits. This is not a charity project. The parents will earn their wages to rent a home, buy the food and things needed for their families. As a benefit of working for the businesses, costs of adoptions will be paid by the businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine if we could have done this for the children you saw in the video.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>How many of these self-sustaining communities can we use around our world?</strong></p>
<h3>We need your help now,</h3>
<p>   to be able to get the land. We are anticipating that it will take about $200,000 in total to get the land we need for the project. We are asking our Indiegogo supporters to help with $5,000 of that as the goal. </p>
<p>We are also discussing this project with sponsors and foundations in both the USA and Mexico for the rest of the funds needed for the land and the construction.  Once the businesses are built, it is self-sustaining economically and will finish building itself out from then on.</p>
<p>100% of the funds received go to implementation of this project. Our staff and board of directors are passionate and dedicated volunteers who are here to help the children and who take no money for doing it.</p>
<h3> Think about the impact of this ""solution"" to helping communities and orphans.</h3>
<p>You probably know that children on the street or in traditional orphanages have poor health, little education, few if any job skills, poor social skills, have no idea what a family is or does, and are not prepared for their, or their country's future. They become liabilities for their society.</p>
<p> This project, will get orphans into financially stable families and communities, where they will receive the love, care, education and preparation to be productive citizens, assets for their society.</p>

<p></p>This campaign is to raise funds to <b>build families and communities. We do this by getting foster children </b><b>out of foster care
and into a real, forever home</b> with caring family members instead of being <b>forced out into the streets at 18 years old</b>, alone and with no family support. <b>We build communities</b> because we save foster care agencies millions of dollars that can now be redirected to community<b> infrastructure improvements such as streetlights, sidewalks and fire stations</b>.<br/>
<h2>
<br/>
</h2><h2>Update<br/>
</h2><p><b>We have passed our goal of $3,000.</b> Now we're looking to help <b>build twice as many families</b> and give more foster children a brighter future. <b>Help us reach our new goal of $6,000.</b></p><p><b>We also have two very unique perks by Robert Aragon as well as an original commissioned sketch by Victor Olazaba of Spider-Man. </b><br/></p><h2>
<br/><b>A Foster Child's Story</b><br/>
</h2><p>Let me share one of our cases.<b> Veronica is 15 years old.</b> She’s
your typical teenager. She was <b>living with her
father </b>and thinking about her senior year, dating and going out with her friends. Boom! <b>Her
whole world just changed because her dad was sent to prison for 10 years</b>. Veronica was moved out of her
house and placed into foster care. She was moved to a new school and away from her friends. At <b>15 years old, there is almost no chance that Veronica will be
adopted</b>. On her 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, Veronica will be essentially <b>put out
on the street, alone</b> and with no support and no family. </p>
<p>Once on the street, she had a <b>90% chance of becoming homeless,
turning to drugs or prostitution, getting raped</b>, becoming pregnant or ending up
in prison all <b>before her 20<sup>th</sup> birthday</b> unless something happened to
change her future right away! </p>
<p><b>Foster children are resilient, smart and adaptable.</b> They just want a chance to have the same life as other kids. There are <b>84,000 more foster youths just like Veronica</b> who
need someone to help give them that chance at a better future.</p><p><br/></p><h2>
<b>A Proven Solution</b><br/>
</h2>
<p>The great news is that <b>there is a solution and it’s been around
for more than 20 years</b>. It’s called Find Families In Mexico.  <b>Foster care agencies across the U.S. bring us their foster children cases </b>when case workers have been unable to locate relatives in the U.S. but there might be family members living in Mexico. </p><p><b>We have a <b>95% success rate</b> in locating relatives. </b>Our success almost always results in other relatives being located in the U.S. so that ultimately foster children are placed with family members or adoptive parents.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Average cost per foster child case is $500. The service we provide to foster care agencies is pro bono (free). </b>The number of cases we can take on is limited by the donations we receive. The activity of finding families in Mexico includes:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Documentation and government report fees </li>
<li>Research materials and database costs </li>
<li>International calls</li>
<li>Bilingual support staff, translators<br/>
</li>
<li>On the ground investigators in Mexico<br/>
</li>
</ul><b>There are hard expenses that must be covered on a per-case basis to support our work including:</b><ul>
<li>Overhead and office supplies, printing expenses</li>
<li>Accounting, government filings<br/>
</li>
<li>Fundraising costs</li>
<li>Indiegogo campaign fee.<br/>
</li>
</ul><br/><h2>
<b>Why We Need Your Help!</b><br/>
</h2>
<p>This campaign will provide the funding so our organization can take on six to eight new foster children cases meaning that at least eight foster youths just like Veronica won’t have to spend years in the foster care
system. Instead <b>these kids will be living in a permanent home with loving,
caring relatives or adoptive parents</b>. They’ll do better in school, make friends, graduate and go on
to college. And <b>when they graduate, these former foster kids will be in the 10%
who will be able to get a job and hold onto it</b> and have the confidence and

</ul><br/><p></p></div>","This campaign is to raise funds to build families and communities. We do this by getting foster children out of foster care
and into a real, forever home with caring family members instead of being forced out into the streets at 18 years old, alone and with no family support. We build communities because we save foster care agencies millions of dollars that can now be redirected to community infrastructure improvements such as streetlights, sidewalks and fire stations.


Update
We have passed our goal of $3,000. Now we're looking to help build twice as many families and give more foster children a brighter future. Help us reach our new goal of $6,000.We also have two very unique perks by Robert Aragon as well as an original commissioned sketch by Victor Olazaba of Spider-Man. 
A Foster Child's Story
Let me share one of our cases. Veronica is 15 years old. She’s
your typical teenager. She was living with her
father and thinking about her senior year, dating and going out with her friends. Boom! Her
whole world just changed because her dad was sent to prison for 10 years. Veronica was moved out of her
house and placed into foster care. She was moved to a new school and away from her friends. At 15 years old, there is almost no chance that Veronica will be
adopted. On her 18th birthday, Veronica will be essentially put out
on the street, alone and with no support and no family. 
Once on the street, she had a 90% chance of becoming homeless,
turning to drugs or prostitution, getting raped, becoming pregnant or ending up
in prison all before her 20th birthday unless something happened to
change her future right away! 
Foster children are resilient, smart and adaptable. They just want a chance to have the same life as other kids. There are 84,000 more foster youths just like Veronica who
need someone to help give them that chance at a better future.
A Proven Solution

The great news is that there is a solution and it’s been around
for more than 20 years. It’s called Find Families In Mexico.  Foster care agencies across the U.S. bring us their foster children cases when case workers have been unable to locate relatives in the U.S. but there might be family members living in Mexico. We have a 95% success rate in locating relatives. Our success almost always results in other relatives being located in the U.S. so that ultimately foster children are placed with family members or adoptive parents.Average cost per foster child case is $500. The service we provide to foster care agencies is pro bono (free). The number of cases we can take on is limited by the donations we receive. The activity of finding families in Mexico includes:
Documentation and government report fees 
Research materials and database costs 
International calls
Bilingual support staff, translators

On the ground investigators in Mexico

There are hard expenses that must be covered on a per-case basis to support our work including:
Overhead and office supplies, printing expenses
Accounting, government filings

Fundraising costs
Indiegogo campaign fee.


Why We Need Your Help!

This campaign will provide the funding so our organization can take on six to eight new foster children cases meaning that at least eight foster youths just like Veronica won’t have to spend years in the foster care
system. Instead these kids will be living in a permanent home with loving,
caring relatives or adoptive parents. They’ll do better in school, make friends, graduate and go on
to college. And when they graduate, these former foster kids will be in the 10%
who will be able to get a job and hold onto it and have the confidence and
support to go out on their own and succeed. 

We reached our $3,000 milestone!
Thank you to everyone, especially Tom Antion and all of the people who took advantage of his very generous offer. In case you didn't get the news, Tom is giving triple value for his perk (See $500 - Consultation with Tom Antion), Now when you get the perk, you will receive three 30 minute consults with Tom. If you want to position you and your business for success in 2015, your time with Tom will be invaluable. 
Our Stretch Goal $6,000
So now that we have passed $3,000, it's time to look to our stretch goal of $6,000. This will allow our organization can take on 12-15 new foster children cases. 
Here Is How the Money Will Be Spent
$6,000 will allow our organization to take on 12-15 new foster children cases. We average 1.5 foster children per case. Some cases involve one child while others include several siblings. We project being able to help 18-23 foster children.This $6,000 will help reduce foster care spending by about $4,370,000 (based on 23 foster children with an average support cost of $190,000 per child).Or all of us including businesses can pay up to $300,000 per foster child forced out of the foster care system to fend for themselves on the street. Our goal of $6,000 will give 23 foster children a much brighter future and save taxpayers roughly $6.9 million. How Our Work Builds CommunitiesThe $6.9 million we can save in taxpayer dollars can be used to improve or expand community services such as streetlights, sidewalks and fire stations. For instance, $6.9 million is the amount that Jersey City needed to retain or hire 49 firefighters.    The majority of the funds goes directly into the work of researching and locating a foster child's family members living in Mexico. It can be very challenging to locate people there because Mexico lacks national databases. Don't think that a Google search will work.Our founder, Richard Villasana, is one of the leading international experts on Mexico genealogy. People from around the world contact him to help them find their relatives and ancestors after they've tried everything including Google, Facebook and Twitter. He has reunited families from more than 10 countries, such as Australia, Germany and Ireland with their Mexican relatives.In most every case we handle, the family members in Mexico will have contact information on other relatives living in the U.S. resulting in foster children being placed with them.
Your contribution will help make a positive, lasting change for every foster child we serve.

</p>
<p>With this campaign we are fundraising for children in the community
of Thakarwadi in Maharashtra state, India. Money raised will enable us 
to buy solar lamps for the children to study during evenings as many 
homes have only a limited availability of electricity.</p>
<p>Nektarina Non Profit, a UK-based
organisation dedicated to educating, connecting and inspiring people to 
care
about their communities and their environment is coordinating this 
project with a local staff member based in Maharashtra who 
has visited the community and through whom we will organise 
the purchase of items in India.</p>

is a small village in the Pune district of Maharashtra, in central-western India. Financially, its inhabitants are very poor and they get food only if they work everyday and earn something. Consequently education<span> is often not considered as a priority,
as parents can’t afford the cost of education and keep the children at home to
help them. Even though, children in the village have told us they believe education will
help them to </span><span></span>break the cycle of living day-by-day and many wish to
become teachers or social workers and go on to help others.<span>
<br/></span><p></p>
<p></p>

Through
our first crowdfunding campaign, students from the same community were provided with bicycles (as some of them had to walk around 6km a day to attend school) and with
other school supplies. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1425103/files/20150429042031-event_1.jpg?1430306431"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div> <div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3></h3>
<p>In all we provided
bicycles to 12 children from Thakarwadi village studying in Janseva Vidyakay

With this campaign we are fundraising for children in the community
of Thakarwadi in Maharashtra state, India. Money raised will enable us 
to buy solar lamps for the children to study during evenings as many 
homes have only a limited availability of electricity.
Nektarina Non Profit, a UK-based
organisation dedicated to educating, connecting and inspiring people to 
care
about their communities and their environment is coordinating this 
project with a local staff member based in Maharashtra who 
has visited the community and through whom we will organise 
the purchase of items in India.

Thakarwadi
is a small village in the Pune district of Maharashtra, in central-western India. Financially, its inhabitants are very poor and they get food only if they work everyday and earn something. Consequently education is often not considered as a priority,
as parents can’t afford the cost of education and keep the children at home to
help them. Even though, children in the village have told us they believe education will
help them to break the cycle of living day-by-day and many wish to
become teachers or social workers and go on to help others.



Through
our first crowdfunding campaign, students from the same community were provided with bicycles (as some of them had to walk around 6km a day to attend school) and with
other school supplies. 
  
In all we provided
bicycles to 12 children from Thakarwadi village studying in Janseva Vidyakay
Vadzire secondary school - 7 girls and 5 boys. They also received a collection
of 8 books each. A special ceremony was organized at Janseva Vidyakay Vadzire
secondary school to present the children with these items. Vice Chancellor of
Nagpur University Dr. S. N. Pathan was chief guest at the function, and
students, parents, people from local communities, Sarpanch (Village Head), and
school committee members were also present.
The event was
broadcasted on a local TV News Channel.

What We Need & What You GetAll money raised will go towards solar lamps no matter what our total is.
If we raise below our target of £1000, we will simply buy fewer solar lamps. In the event that we
exceed our target, we will buy additional solar lamps. 
The Impact 
35 children from the village currently attend schools. They don´t have electricity in their homes to study in the  evening/night so
they use lamps that run on kerosene. 
If we provide them with solar lamps they
can study during the evenings. These lamps will also bring huge health
benefits as students and others, particularly women, are currently inhaling
large amounts of toxic smoke and fumes from these kerosene lamps. Replacing
them with solar powered lamps will greatly cut down on these harmful gases.
They also do not require fuel, thus saving money. These lamps are an
appropriate and sustainable solution to this endemic problem.

<p>Vegetable Circus is a program of the Allied Wellness Education Network, a 501(c)3 non-profit. It is our mission to use circus arts to teach children creative and exciting ways to grow up healthy. Interactive assembly shows, structured multi-week enrichment programs, and hands-on workshops educate kids about living healthy in engaging and confidence-raising ways that support their development.  Since 2005, Vegetable Circus has expanded to offer services to schools and community organizations across America.  Our most active regions are in New England, North Carolina, and California. Between 2012 and 2014, Vegetable Circus performed over 100 assembly shows and provided over 1,000 hours of after school enrichment programming in Elementary schools across the country, delivering our wellness message to over 40,000 children! </p>
<p>With a growing demand for Vegetable Circus services across America, it is necessary to maintain our national liability insurance policy. In years past we have been able to maintain our insurance policy with revenue from our services, but with the growing costs of expansion and as a non-profit, we cannot afford it without you! Please help us leave a lasting impression and a greater impact of our wellness message on children, families, and schools across america!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p></p>
<p>Our funding goal is $1,500 and 100% of your donations will go straight to renewing our national liability insurance policy. This is vital to ongoing Vegetable Circus services at many elementary schools and also to the expansion of Vegetable Circus services into new communities. If we exceed our goal, additional money we raise will go to enhancing our assembly shows and enrichment programs. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>In addition to the satisfaction you will have knowing that you contributed to enriching young student lives, you will receive a receipt from Firstgiving.com which authenticates your donation as tax deductible. You will also receive one of many unique perks with your donation. Our perks offer a large variety of items and services that also make spectacular gifts!  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>

Vegetable Circus is a program of the Allied Wellness Education Network, a 501(c)3 non-profit. It is our mission to use circus arts to teach children creative and exciting ways to grow up healthy. Interactive assembly shows, structured multi-week enrichment programs, and hands-on workshops educate kids about living healthy in engaging and confidence-raising ways that support their development.  Since 2005, Vegetable Circus has expanded to offer services to schools and community organizations across America.  Our most active regions are in New England, North Carolina, and California. Between 2012 and 2014, Vegetable Circus performed over 100 assembly shows and provided over 1,000 hours of after school enrichment programming in Elementary schools across the country, delivering our wellness message to over 40,000 children! 
With a growing demand for Vegetable Circus services across America, it is necessary to maintain our national liability insurance policy. In years past we have been able to maintain our insurance policy with revenue from our services, but with the growing costs of expansion and as a non-profit, we cannot afford it without you! Please help us leave a lasting impression and a greater impact of our wellness message on children, families, and schools across america!

   What We Need 
Our funding goal is $1,500 and 100% of your donations will go straight to renewing our national liability insurance policy. This is vital to ongoing Vegetable Circus services at many elementary schools and also to the expansion of Vegetable Circus services into new communities. If we exceed our goal, additional money we raise will go to enhancing our assembly shows and enrichment programs. 


What You Get
In addition to the satisfaction you will have knowing that you contributed to enriching young student lives, you will receive a receipt from Firstgiving.com which authenticates your donation as tax deductible. You will also receive one of many unique perks with your donation. Our perks offer a large variety of items and services that also make spectacular gifts!  


  The Impact Vegetable Circus inspires children to make healthy decisions and take care of their growing bodies.  Vegetable Circus services teach children the three ingredients to healthy living which are healthy eating, healthy moving, and healthy relaxation.
With a growing epidemic of child obesity, it is imperative to bring this message of wellness to schools and communities across the nation.  We have received feedback from children, parents, school faculty, and community event organizers that Vegetable Circus services get children excited about living and eating healthy.

</h3> <p>What our youth are saying (excerpts of their Personal Commitment) after living the TOB ENCOUNTER (Two Days Retreat):<br/>• “After encountering Jesus through TOB and the love He has for us, I realized that Love needs to be enacted out. What touched me was that through one’s BODY we can connect ourselves to God. TOB is not just about relationship with people, about our desires, but it is about selfless giving of ourselves. TOB made me realize we have hope in Jesus!”- Ajay Bilung<br/></p>
<p>• “I loved the talks and sessions. I discovered I am awesome. I am precious child of my Father! This Encounter has bought me closer to God. Now I am not hiding my sins.”- Patrick Rosario<br/></p>
<p>• “I realized that it is never too late to turn from the darkness to the light of God. I am eager and pray for wisdom to God and St. John Paul 2 to know more about Theology of the Body and to Encounter Jesus Christ”. - Daniel Gomes<br/></p>
<p>• “All the testimonies shared by the JTM members really touched me. It made me realize that I’m not the only one who is hurt. I realized I need to spend more time with God and build a strong relationship with Him.” – Sophia Rosario<br/></p>
<p>• “The talks were awesome the videos and the films were terrific. I am proud to be a Catholic” – Sonu Minj<br/></p>
<p>• “I have inner peace. This ECOUNTER brought me closer to Jesus I had never experienced such a peaceful and enriching retreat. This ECOUNTER gave a proper meaning to my life. I am a changed person now.” – Sourav Ekka<br/></p>
<p>• “I was blessed by the testimonies of the team, by their joy in the Lord, by the reminder that God has created my heart for Love and to Love, that only he can fully satisfy my heart. The time of Adoration was a beautiful Encounter with the the Love of Jesus.” – Susanna de Almeida<br/></p>

Throughout my life I have studied Rudolf Steiner's philosophy of Biodynamic Agriculture (BDA). When I became a full-time farmer following the birth of my son, Uriel, nearly three years ago, embracing BDA was foremost on my list. Over the past few years, as I implemented what I have learned from Steiner's <i>Agriculture</i> book, I realize that I would benefit greatly from studying directly with a master. This opportunity has arisen for me with the imminent arrival in the US of the Italian BDA practitioner and lecturer, Enzo Nastati. I have been awarded a partial scholarship to attend the historic seminar Sir. Nastati is giving in October 2013 in Kentucky. However, I am still in need of assistance with covering the tuition costs for the seminar and my travel costs. It is my goal to assist in the founding of a Biodynamic education facility in western NC and the seeds of this project are beginning to germinate. To this end, I hope to receive as much guidance from gifted teachers as possible, so that I may share what I learn with other farmers. I am considering myself as an ambassador-of-sorts from western NC to the KY gathering. I hope that you will assist me in this lofty goal!</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">To Give is To Receive</span></p><p>The cost of the seminar is $600.00 and covers everything. This is a break-even cost I am sure, as lodging and classes for 5 days are included in this cost.</p><p>The partial scholarship I have received through the Biodynamic Farm &amp; Gardening Association is for $225.00.</p><p>I am still in need of $375 for tuition for the seminar and $400 for travel. My plan is to rent a car and drive to Louisville, so the $400 is for a rental car and gas only. Lodging is being provided by the host farm and I plan on bringing lots of my own BD farm-grown veggies to nourish my body and spirit during this amazing learning experience! If I do not reach my goal through this Indiegogo avenue, I will find the remaining funds somewhere! I truly believe I need to be present for this historic event. I believe it will happen somehow.</p><p>Throughout my adult life I have found myself educating and teaching others. It is something that runs in my blood (my mother and grandmother were teachers) and I thoroughly enjoy it! I am also an enthusiastic student. I graduated with a B.S. (cum laude) in 2008 from UNC-A and I have chosen to learn as much as possible from every unique work and life experience I have been blessed to receive. Learning and teaching is my gig!</p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Why is this so important?</span><br/></p><p>If you believe that stewarding the earth is important; if you believe that farms should be truly sustainable; and if you believe that this needs to happen on a large scale immediately, then you understand that this is important. BDA offers a truly sustainable method of farming, where costs are not externalized. In my opinion, the externalization of costs is one of the main problems affecting our collective social, environmental, and financial wellbeing. At the very heart of BDA is the concept of a farm operating as an individual organism, taking and giving what it needs from itself. Even certified organic practices do not embrace this concept as fully as BDA (my farm is certified organic). Further, to bring BDA into modern times, to address our myriad modern problems, is essential to remaining relevant. Enzo Nastati has done this very thing - addressing nuclear radiation, water scarcity and quality issues, climate change (which could have potentially disastrous effects on agriculture and thus our food supply. This cannot be overstated). </p><p>My goal in life is to operate out of hope and love, not fear and despair. I do not want to appeal to your despair, but rather your hope. I believe that it is possible to renew our ravaged Earth. I believe that it is possible to renew the connections that nourish us - connections with the blessed Earth who feeds us; connections with each other which inspire us; connections with the Divine/God/Great Spirit which bring out the very best Light within us. ""This little light of mine, I'm going to let it Shine"". For myself, the way that I have chosen to address the myriad problems facing the culture and society I am in is to grow food and medicine in a sustainable way.

And thank you so much.</p></div>","Send a Farmer to a Biodynamic Conference My name is Amy Hamilton. I am a farmer in western NC. Throughout my life I have studied Rudolf Steiner's philosophy of Biodynamic Agriculture (BDA). When I became a full-time farmer following the birth of my son, Uriel, nearly three years ago, embracing BDA was foremost on my list. Over the past few years, as I implemented what I have learned from Steiner's Agriculture book, I realize that I would benefit greatly from studying directly with a master. This opportunity has arisen for me with the imminent arrival in the US of the Italian BDA practitioner and lecturer, Enzo Nastati. I have been awarded a partial scholarship to attend the historic seminar Sir. Nastati is giving in October 2013 in Kentucky. However, I am still in need of assistance with covering the tuition costs for the seminar and my travel costs. It is my goal to assist in the founding of a Biodynamic education facility in western NC and the seeds of this project are beginning to germinate. To this end, I hope to receive as much guidance from gifted teachers as possible, so that I may share what I learn with other farmers. I am considering myself as an ambassador-of-sorts from western NC to the KY gathering. I hope that you will assist me in this lofty goal!To Give is To ReceiveThe cost of the seminar is $600.00 and covers everything. This is a break-even cost I am sure, as lodging and classes for 5 days are included in this cost.The partial scholarship I have received through the Biodynamic Farm & Gardening Association is for $225.00.I am still in need of $375 for tuition for the seminar and $400 for travel. My plan is to rent a car and drive to Louisville, so the $400 is for a rental car and gas only. Lodging is being provided by the host farm and I plan on bringing lots of my own BD farm-grown veggies to nourish my body and spirit during this amazing learning experience! If I do not reach my goal through this Indiegogo avenue, I will find the remaining funds somewhere! I truly believe I need to be present for this historic event. I believe it will happen somehow.Throughout my adult life I have found myself educating and teaching others. It is something that runs in my blood (my mother and grandmother were teachers) and I thoroughly enjoy it! I am also an enthusiastic student. I graduated with a B.S. (cum laude) in 2008 from UNC-A and I have chosen to learn as much as possible from every unique work and life experience I have been blessed to receive. Learning and teaching is my gig!Why is this so important?If you believe that stewarding the earth is important; if you believe that farms should be truly sustainable; and if you believe that this needs to happen on a large scale immediately, then you understand that this is important. BDA offers a truly sustainable method of farming, where costs are not externalized. In my opinion, the externalization of costs is one of the main problems affecting our collective social, environmental, and financial wellbeing. At the very heart of BDA is the concept of a farm operating as an individual organism, taking and giving what it needs from itself. Even certified organic practices do not embrace this concept as fully as BDA (my farm is certified organic). Further, to bring BDA into modern times, to address our myriad modern problems, is essential to remaining relevant. Enzo Nastati has done this very thing - addressing nuclear radiation, water scarcity and quality issues, climate change (which could have potentially disastrous effects on agriculture and thus our food supply. This cannot be overstated). My goal in life is to operate out of hope and love, not fear and despair. I do not want to appeal to your despair, but rather your hope. I believe that it is possible to renew our ravaged Earth. I believe that it is possible to renew the connections that nourish us - connections with the blessed Earth who feeds us; connections with each other which inspire us; connections with the Divine/God/Great Spirit which bring out the very best Light within us. ""This little light of mine, I'm going to let it Shine"". For myself, the way that I have chosen to address the myriad problems facing the culture and society I am in is to grow food and medicine in a sustainable way. BDA offers me the opportunity to pursue a spiritual path in a practical way. Thank you for taking the time to read this and if you are moved to  contribute to this noble endeavor, I will be so grateful to you - for your belief in a renewed Earth, truly sustainable farming, and one little 5'3"" farming woman in the blessed Appalachian mountains.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are not able to contribute financially, I would appreciate your support by sharing this project with others; you can participate in our BDA education in western NC; come out to help on the farm!

<p>Most people experience struggle sometime in their life.  However, in just a few short months, single parent Matt Schwartz and his children, have experienced an unbelievable turn of events that would make most people crumble.</p>
<p><strong>What Would You Do If...</strong>  </p>
<p><em>You suddenly had a child with a life threatening illness?      </em></p>

<p>November 17th<strong>, </strong>2011 started as a joyous day for Matt Schwartz and his three children, all under 7 years old. They welcomed Matt's fourth child and new baby brother, Houston, into the world.</p>
<p>On that day, <strong>Matt was told that his newborn son, Houston, had a life threatening illness and within a few short weeks Matt lost his job, his home, his car and he sold most of the family belongings to pay family daily living expenses.</strong>  Matt did keep sentimental belongings, the kid’s beds and some of their toys, which are currently in storage. Thankfully, two local car dealerships got together and gave Matt a reliable car.  He would be completely lost without it.</p>
<p>Being a single Dad, it is virtually impossible for Matt to look for work right now.  His time is divided between his son, Houston, at Penn State Milton Hershey Medical Center and his three other young children staying at the Ronald McDonald House.  When not at the Ronald McDonald House, Matt and his children live in his mother's basement in York, Pennsylvania.   </p>
<p>After hearing about Matt's plight, Facebook friends and complete strangers came together to become Houston's Angels.  Our main goal is to reach out and help Matt and his family in any way possible.</p>
<p>Like most of us, it is difficult for Matt to ask for help, but that is what Angels are for, right?  We want to help get Matt back on his feet as he helps Houston fight for his life, while caring for his other three children. This family needs stability, which they have not had since November 2011.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Matt Can NOT Do This On His Own</strong></h2>
<p>Since Matt lost his job and is the full-time caregiver for his 4 kids, including critically ill Houston, he needs our help.  <strong>It will be a while until Matt is able to make an income and provide for his family on his own.</strong>  We would love to take away his stress of having to worry about how to feed and house his children.</p>
<p>Ideally, Matt would like to rent an apartment close to Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, so he can get Houston there quickly if there is an emergency, yet still be near his other children.</p>
<p>Houston's Angels want to make certain that Matt has money for ""everyday"" living expenses and all the extra daily things necessary that mount quickly when you're not working... and that WE ALL tend to take for granted.</p>
<h2><strong>How Can We Help Matt?</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you are lucky enough to know Matt Schwartz and his family personally, or whether they are strangers to you, please give what you can to help Matt and his children through this very difficult and trying time in their lives.</p>
<p><strong><em>Approximate</em></strong><strong> Living Expenses for Matt and his children for at least 12 months...</strong></p>
<p>* Apartment Rental ($9,600)</p>
<p>* Utilities ($4,200)</p>
<p>* Car Insurance ($960)</p>
<p>* Gas ($720)</p>
<p>* Cell Phone ($720)</p>
<p>* Child Care ($10,000+)</p>
<p>* Diapers ($1,000)</p>
<p>* Storage and Moving Expenses ($300)</p>
<p>* Eating only One Meal at Hospital Every day ($3,650)</p>
<p>* Food/Groceries for the Family ($9,600)</p>
<p>* School Supplies and Clothing ($600)</p>
<p>* Daily living expenses that we all take for granted ($3,000)</p>
<h3><strong>This all adds up to over $43,000!  </strong></h3>
<p><em>Ultimately, we would love to set the goal higher for Matt.  To be honest, the website takes a higher percentage if you don't reach the goal, so we decided to set it lower.  Matt and his family are so appreciative for any and all help, but please keep in mind that the goal is just a fraction of what Matt will need to care for his family for the months and years to come.<strong> </strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help Matt</strong></h2>
<p><strong>* In-Kind Donations:   </strong>Anyone in the Hershey/Palmyra, Pennsylvania area  could offer free rent to Matt and his kids.  Matt is a handy guy and could trade rent for handy work.  When Matt does find a home, he will need to replace all of the furniture and household goods.

<p><strong>Houston's Story</strong></p>
<p>Houston was born November 17th, 2011. Shortly after his birth, his Daddy realized he looked blue. When Houston was checked it was found there was a problem with his heart. He was flown to Penn State Milton Hershey Medical Center and given the diagnosis of TAPVR. That stands for total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Blood that would normally be oxygenated was being short circuited and Houston's little body was being deprived of that oxygen rich blood.</p>
<p>Within months of being born, <strong>this little fighter has had 3 open heart surgeries, 2 balloon caths and another surgery to place a feeding tube. </strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, with this condition, the body over heals itself causing narrowing in the crucial veins in the heart.  The balloon cath surgeries placed a tiny balloon with blades on the end that went into all four veins and cleared scarring.</p>
<p>The feeding tube surgery placed a Mik-Key button into his tummy for feeding and a NJ for medications.  The NJ is a continual drip for formula purposes.  Having both tubes is wonderful, since Houston can get both food and medication at the same time and not have to wait for one or the other. </p>
<p>Houston has multiple heart medications, extra nutrition in his formula, and a chemotherapy drug called Gleevec. The heart medications are given by syringe through a cap in his feeding tube. Each one has to be slowly given as not to overwhelm his tiny body.</p>
<p>The Gleevec is given twice a day and takes over an hour to administer. During that time he is also given medication to combat the nausea that is a side effect. Each dose has to be exact and is timed for depressing the syringe and the time between each dose.</p>
<p>This little guy is a fighter and has already beaten the odds thanks to the care and research by Matt.  Houston has a ready smile and is very alert. He has spent a good deal of his life in the hospital and anesthetized. Houston has not been bottle fed since his last trip to the hospital March 5th 2012. The family is able to hold him now, but must be very careful.</p>
<p><strong>About Pulmonary Vein Stenosis</strong></p>
<p><em>Houston Schwartz has a rare condition called Pulmonary Vein Stenosis, which causes an obstruction in the blood vessels that bring oxygen-rich blood from the lungs back to the heart.</em></p>
<p><em>The stenosis occurs because of abnormal cell growth, making the veins' walls thicken and narrow.</em></p>
<p><em>The condition frequently gets worse. As a result, the person can lose partial or total flow to vessels.</em></p>
<p><em>Many children with the most severe form of pulmonary vein stenosis do not survive past early childhood.</em></p>
<p><em>To treat the disease, doctors can widen the veins in an open-heart surgery, attempt to stretch the vessels by cardiac catheterization with balloon dilation or do a transplant to replace the lungs and the pulmonary veins. But response to surgery or catheterization is usually short-lived, and transplants come with risks including rejection of the transplanted lung and serious infection.</em></p>

Houston has multiple heart medications, extra nutrition in his formula, and a chemotherapy drug called Gleevec. The heart medications are given by syringe through a cap in his feeding tube. Each one has to be slowly given as not to overwhelm his tiny body.
The Gleevec is given twice a day and takes over an hour to administer. During that time he is also given medication to combat the nausea that is a side effect. Each dose has to be exact and is timed for depressing the syringe and the time between each dose.
This little guy is a fighter and has already beaten the odds thanks to the care and research by Matt.  Houston has a ready smile and is very alert. He has spent a good deal of his life in the hospital and anesthetized. Houston has not been bottle fed since his last trip to the hospital March 5th 2012. The family is able to hold him now, but must be very careful.
About Pulmonary Vein Stenosis
Houston Schwartz has a rare condition called Pulmonary Vein Stenosis, which causes an obstruction in the blood vessels that bring oxygen-rich blood from the lungs back to the heart.
The stenosis occurs because of abnormal cell growth, making the veins' walls thicken and narrow.
The condition frequently gets worse. As a result, the person can lose partial or total flow to vessels.
Many children with the most severe form of pulmonary vein stenosis do not survive past early childhood.
To treat the disease, doctors can widen the veins in an open-heart surgery, attempt to stretch the vessels by cardiac catheterization with balloon dilation or do a transplant to replace the lungs and the pulmonary veins. But response to surgery or catheterization is usually short-lived, and transplants come with risks including rejection of the transplanted lung and serious infection.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p><a href=""http://http://studiosankofa.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">RYISE - Realize Youth Infinitely Self Empowered</span></a> Arts and Leadership Project (Camp), is made up of incredible youth artist leaders and their adult artist and social entrepreneur mentors.  Over the years we have witnessed a common challenge; infinite potential in the youth and limited resources in many of the families to support their youth.  We offer cutting edge support to  all youth in arts, youth social entrepreneurial, and leadership development.   We provide youth with the mentors, tools and resources needed to cultivate success academically, socially, and professionally.  Our youth are given a voice and the power to shape their own arts and leadership programs.  Youth come together as leadership committees and create programs and projects for other youth and for their communities.  Even though we offer these services at a much lower cost than most other youth services, many families still are not able to send their youth to enrichment programs in the summers and after school during the fiscal school year.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>The change the world is looking for is right in front of us.  Our youth have a different way of viewing the world future's great potential.  Their ideas and visions are ground shakingly phenomenal at times, yet often go either unheard or unseen.  The youth need people who will take a stand for change and help them to build a platform to be heard and seen for the great visionaries and creative geniuses that they are.  RYISE is the platform that allows youth to realize their greatness and be empowered to manifest their amazing visions for the world in this new era.  <br/><br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We have a long waiting list of youth desiring to get into the RYISE Arts and Leadership Camp happening July 11, 2011 and they need your support.  The camp's tuition is $800 per youth.  The tuition allows youth from low income households to have access to the high quality of enrichment activities, tools, resources, and professional mentors/facilitators that youth from affluent communities often are accustomed to.  <br/></p>
<p>We have been meeting with our junior and senior youth leadership committees and they have voiced exactly what they want from their camp this year.  In order for us to support their vision and voice, we need your help.  We are helping the youth raise $30,000 for their idea camp program.  In the spirit of The 2008 Obama Presidential Campaign, we are calling on every one and every level of contribution.  Every penny counts as this is a mass movement effort.  Your small or large contribution will combine to make a great impact on these youth's lives through this empowering arts and leadership project.  </p>

Our Story 
WE are three teenegers from Morocco, Congo and Venezuela living in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Our intention, or
""Kuhamasisha"" in Swahili, is to raise our Consciousness by learning
about ourselves and how to communicate peacefully to make a better World.
 
Methusela Bwiseze 
I'm 17years old and I'm from
Congo, Africa.  I have been here (in the U.S.) for one year.  I 'm so
ecxited to learn more about peace because some countries in Africa they
lose peace.  This opportunity is good to know more about bringing peace in
the world, but i need your help so I can reach this opportunity and maybe
I will be helpful to my community and countries.
Salah El Hachimi
I'm 16 years old and I'm form Morocco,
North Africa.  I really want to go to this camp to learn more about peace
all over the world and meet with people from other countries.  I came here
to U.S.A. to have a better education and to go to better schools.  I want to share what I learn with the people in my community.
Brigith Bautista
I am from Venezuela and I am 15
years old.  I am a girl that really
cares about nature and the environment, peace and love.  I always try to make my dreams happen,
and one of my dreams is to change this world and to make it better.  The way I want to do this is by
studying in depth about it, I think Play in the Wild! is my opportunity. 
The Impact











Our purpose is to educate ourselves on how to establish peace,
love, harmony and patience in our lives and share this with those around us to
create a new world in which each one of us is the change.  We are
youth, we are the future of our world.  By contributing to our cause
you are nourishing thirsty hearts of Peace without war. (Translated from Spanish, original text below.)



Nuestro propósito es educarnos acerca establecer paz, amor,
tranquilidad, paciencia en nuestras vidas para así poder enseñar a las personas
que nos rodean que podemos crear un Nuevo mundo en el que cada uno de
nosotros sea el protagonista. Tenga en cuenta de que somos jovenes, y que somos
el futuro de nuestra tierra. Si usted contribuye a esta causa estaría
alimentando a corazones con sed de Paz sin guerra.  
-Brigith Bautista

<p style=""color: #000000; font-size: 16px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;"">The goal of our <a href=""http://www.biomatsa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Biomat S.A."">company</a> is to apply our disruptive water-based technology to create sustainable food and energy by growing low-cost and very high-scale microalgae spirulina<span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span> As part of our social-capitalist corporate goal, in addition to sales of product,<strong> we will distribute FREE spirulina to end child malnutrition in the world.</strong> </p>
<p style=""color: #000000; font-size: 16px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;"">We are at the point where we need to rent a warehouse, hire labour and buy industrial-scale equipment to harvest, package, store and ship very large quantities of spirulina as part of our business plan expansion. </p>
<p style=""color: #000000; font-size: 16px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;"">We are reaching out to all of you to accelerate this project, and to give everyone in the world the opportunity to claim that <strong>""I helped end child malnutrition and global hunger""</strong>.  Our technology allows us to grow large quantities of protein-rich spirulina at very low cost, and in this way we can sell product to our customers at market prices, while in parallel we will have enough quantities of spirulina to distribute free to those in need, on a global basis.  This is our vision of ""social-capitalism"" at work!</p>

<p style=""color: #000000; font-size: 16px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;"">However, the total ANNUAL amount of spirulina produced in all countries using the existing technologies is estimated at around just over 10,000 metric tons.  Spirulina`s retail price ranges from 50 to 150 dollars per kilo, as it is a scarce, yet valued product.  Therefore, if it was possible for companies to produce such large amounts of spirulina, the average market value of those 600 metric tons of spirulina would be about <strong>60M US dollars</strong> (<em><strong>per day</strong></em>).</p>

Summary
""It always seems impossible until it is done."" - Nelson Mandela
There are over 200 million undernourished children around the world, with millions unnecessarily dying every year.  A few daily grams of spirulina, a marine organism declared by the UN as the most complete food to fight malnutrition at a global scale, will put an end to this tragedy.
The goal of our company is to apply our disruptive water-based technology to create sustainable food and energy by growing low-cost and very high-scale microalgae spirulina.  As part of our social-capitalist corporate goal, in addition to sales of product, we will distribute FREE spirulina to end child malnutrition in the world. 
We are at the point where we need to rent a warehouse, hire labour and buy industrial-scale equipment to harvest, package, store and ship very large quantities of spirulina as part of our business plan expansion. 
We are reaching out to all of you to accelerate this project, and to give everyone in the world the opportunity to claim that ""I helped end child malnutrition and global hunger"".  Our technology allows us to grow large quantities of protein-rich spirulina at very low cost, and in this way we can sell product to our customers at market prices, while in parallel we will have enough quantities of spirulina to distribute free to those in need, on a global basis.  This is our vision of ""social-capitalism"" at work!
About us
My name is Miguel Cizin.  I am 50 years old.  I am an ex-AT&T Bell Labs aerospace engineer, with an MBA in international business.  About 14 years ago, while I was the General Manager of the subsidiary of Canadian company Nortel Networks based in Israel, I met a very unique individual, an Israeli inventor, an autodidact mathematician and physicist, and a water expert: Eran Gabbai.
Eran`s father was one of the pioneers and inventors of the dripping irrigation technology for which Israel is now famous world-wide.
With such an inventive father as his mentor, Eran grew up surrounded and intrigued by water and agriculture.
Back in 1998, Eran shared with me during a boat ride his main invention and concept related to water. He described how by changing the structure of water one could use it as a technology platform similar to what nature and our own bodies do every day (think for example how ice and vapour are different arrangements of the same water molecules, in structures so unique that one has allowed us to refrigerate our foods, and the other to power a turbine to generate electricity.)  I was fascinated by it (and I still am, to this day).
I then asked Eran one simple and straightforward question: ""Why did the universe gave you such a gift?"", to which Eran responded: ""To help the world and to make peace amongst the nations. The Arab world was given oil and paradoxically, also living in the desert, the Jews were given water as a hidden gift to the world. Water is indeed life, and if you can harness its power, you can help the entire world.""
I told Eran that for some reason that I could not understand then, I, a Uruguay-born engineer, and also a citizen of the USA and Israel, would help him make that dream come true, whatever it took.  I have always seen myself as a citizen of the world, a cosmopolitan that has lived in many cities and worked within many cultures, and today I know that this is my main mission in life.
Two years ago Eran visited me in Buenos Aires, Argentina  - where I work today as the General Manager of the subsidiary of an Israeli company.  I offered him, and Eran accepted, to start a new business with me, owned 50-50 and without outside investors, since ours would become a new ""social-capitalist"" company. This term meant that our company would operate as a regular company in a capitalist environment, but its profits would be re-invested exclusively to do social good, and to foster peace and wealth balance, globally. The goal of our company is to apply Eran`s invention to create sustainable food and energy by growing low-cost and very high-scale microalgae spirulina, a marine organism declared by the UN as the most complete food to fight malnutrition at a global scale.   At a second stage, we will grow oil-rich spirulina and convert this oily biomass to truly renewable fuels.  Our plan is to put our technology to work by collaborating with governments in developing countries to create jobs, and in this way help address basic unmet social issues such as rural poverty and hunger, while exporting our products to the richer countries.  We want to help balance the wealth of nations on a global scale, while trading like any other capitalistic company. Our first social project is to end child malnutrition globally. And we want to do it today, immediately, not in the future. With your help, we will start it now.
The challenge of ending child malnutrition
To help you quantify the magnitude of this challenge, please consider that in order to provide at least 3 grams of free spirulina on a daily basis for 200M children, which is just enough to fulfill their daily fortification needs, it will require 600 metric tons of spirulina per day, i.e. over 200,000 metric tons per year.

With Eran`s technology and our company`s goals, and with your help, we are ready and eager to face and win this challenge.

<p>The trip you would be funding is a seven-week program in Prague, Czech Republic and Krakow, Poland. My time in Prague will be spent learning about the historical conservation as well as history of the city and surrounding areas, enhancing my knowledge of Central Europe. I will then move to Krakow, Poland where <strong>I will be working at a premier Jewish museum, given direct access to behind-the-scenes understanding of how the Holocaust is represented to the public. I will also be visiting camps, such as Auschwitz, during my free time, as well as engaging with Holocaust academics in the area. This will be direct research for my Division III and a life-changing experience. </strong></p>
<p>I am a third-year college student and cannot really afford this program, so fundraising is crucial to my ability to continue my research and further my education. I hope to work in Holocaust museums following my graduation, so this will also get me direct experience in the field I want to pursue!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>My program will be through the Dartmore Institue for Central European Studies based in Prague, Czech Republic. The lump sum, then, is a payment to them which covers housing, utilities, occasional group meals, tuition, and their assistance in facilitating my internship.</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel to/from Prague, Czech Republic: $1,500</li>
<li>Food and Personal Expenses: $530</li>
<li>Program itself: $5,750</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You might see I'm asking for less than that. I wanted to set an attainable goal that would make a dent, albeit small, in my overall monetary needs so that the trip is more feasible than it currently is. I need approximately $8,000 for this trip, and if I cannot raise that much, I will most likely need to attempt to borrow money.<br/>My project is currently already supported by <a href=""http://www.hampshire.edu/cs/22715.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Sander Thoenes Division III Research Award.</a></strong></p>
<p>Gifts upon donation will be thank you letters and postcards detailing what you've helped me achieve in my time abroad. I'm also a film photography student, so the more you donate, the higher the ""perks"" - most likely being photographic prints from my time abroad!</p>

<h2>How This Will Make a Difference</h2>
<p>Holocaust education is fundamental in the postwar period. It is vital to attempt to understand what happened in Europe in the 1930s-40s, not only out of respect for those who passed, but to harbor cultures where these kinds of acts are unacceptable. <strong>The more people work to comprehend genocide methods of persecution, the more unlikely we make the continuation of these oppressive actions.</strong></p>

<p>That's okay! It'd be great if you'd spread the word to family and friends who might have an interest in supporting this; and either way, thanks for reading!</p>

What I'm doing
My name is Irissa and I am a student at Hampshire College in Massachusetts. Next school year I embark on my ""Division III,"" which is a self-directed year-long project on the subject which I have been most interested in studying throughout my time at this school. My Division III will be a study of the ways the Holocaust has been represented and taught through museums.

<p><strong>Campagne de soutien à Amina </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Le 17 mars 2013, Amina, la première Femen Tunisienne a été kidnappée et séquestrée par sa famille. Alors qu’elle était majeure.</p>
<p>Après une importante campagne de mobilisation internationale, la famille l'a laissée parler à des journalistes. Nous avons alors eu la confirmation, qu'elle était retenue contre son gré, battue par un cousin,  et qu'elle était dramatiquement soumise à un traitement chimique forcé.</p>
<p>Le 12 avril, Amina a réussi à s'enfuir.  Elle a pu récupérer ses papiers. Mais ils sont périmés, et elle est en train de refaire ses papiers. Elle est maintenant en sécurité grâce à tous.</p>
<p>Mais malgré l'élan de solidarité, ce qui a été déployé n'est qu'une solution d'urgence transitoire. Il faut maintenant qu'elle puisse envisager l'avenir. En toute sécurité et en toute sérénité.</p>
<p>Pour qu’elle continue à vivre de manière indépendante et qu'elle puisse décider de ses choix de vie, nous, ses soutiens, avons décidé de lancer cette campagne par crowdfunding. </p>
<p>Des demandes de bourses d’études ont été faites, et seront en place à la rentrée. Et nous sommes sur des pistes pour un hébergement.</p>
<p>Dans l'immédiat, nous avons besoin de 4000 euros (5200 $).</p>
<p>L'argent récolté servira à payer ses déplacements et son hébergement d'ici septembre.</p>

<h2>Lifting Hope for Haiti's Orphans </h2>
<p>Ladies and Gentleman, thank you for viewing our page.  The video above shows the harsh truth of what it is like growing up poor in Haiti.  Something as simple as a red wagon that you and I may view as a toy, they viewed as a way to transport dead children to the crematorium.  These harsh realities lead us to believe that we must do something to offer opportunites that would be unimaginal otherwise.</p>
<p>This August four of us will be traveling to Haiti to establish a relationship and foundation for continuous humanitarian efforts with the end goal of building a charitable organization.  Haiti is only the starting point; we plan to extend our efforts to impoverished areas at home and abroad.  Our vision is to affect change by providing health, fitness, and education to youth, as well as the volunteers working in Haiti.    </p>
<p>Below is more information about the organizations your donations will be benefiting.  Below that, you can learn more about who we are, and our personal motivations.  </p>
<h3><strong>How will we LIFT HOPE?</strong></h3>
<p>What better way to lift hope and raise money than a Fundraising WOD (Workout of the Day)?  Whether you are competing, or donating to someone that is competing, you will make a difference!   </p>
<p>On August 17th, we will sweat and suffer together in order to raise money for this cause and give back to a community in need.  We will have two events: one for teams and one for individuals.  For more information on the event, please view the following link on Facebook: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/haitisorphans"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/haitisorphans</a></p>
<h3>Organizations Benefiting</h3>
<p><strong>Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos™ International:  </strong>A Christian mission that strives to provide a permanent family and home for orphaned, abandoned and other at-risk children who live in conditions of extreme poverty. Our programs provide quality education, health care and spiritual formation with the goal of raising good Christians and productive members of their respective societies.</p>
<p><strong>St. Damien's Children's Hospital: </strong> The healthcare programs of Nos Petits Freres et Soeurs are motivated by the gospel command to care for the sick and strive to offset the injustices of poverty and unemployment which make healthcare inaccessible for many poor people. Poverty imposes a tremendous burden of sickness and suffering on many children. In an effort to help precisely these children, St Damien Hospital offers both children of poverty, and children of any social level in emergent distress, quality and dignified healthcare. St. Damien always seeks to include the parent participation in this care through ongoing dialogue, on-site opportunities for education, and encouraging any level of material support they can offer for the care of their children.</p>
<p><strong>Artists for Peace and Justice: </strong> We are committed to long-term, sustainable development in direct partnership with the Haitian people. Our model is simple: we believe in empowering local communities, fostering economic growth, and the power of education to change a nation.</p>
<p><strong>Angels of Light:  </strong>Under the NPH umbrella, the Father Wasson Angels of Light (FWAL) program founded the St. Anne Baby House and St. Louis Child Protection Camp. These homes have been a safe haven for the displaced and vulnerable children from Haiti’s devastating earthquake in 2010. Today, over 180 children underage 14 receive care, education and spiritual formation in the loving tradition of “St. Helene,” our flagship facility in Kenscoff, Haiti. Many of the grown children of St. Helene now serve as caregivers and teachers to this new generation of NPH children.</p>
<p><strong>The organization Pwoteje Lavi Timoun yo (PLAT):  </strong>In Haiti, the children are growing up themselves in a harsh environment where the social, economic, and cultural conditions represent a shortfall for many of these children preventing them which are, inter alia: the right to housing, the right to health, the right to proper nutrition, the right to education.  Those most affected are: the orphans, the handicaps, the street children, the children in domestic situations, the abused children who are victims of ill treatments, the exploitation, violence and negligencing taking into account the mentality of the country or the medium in which they are in.</p>
<p>This alarming situation pushes them with the creation of the aforementioned organization to contribute their shares in order to mitigate these problems through their activities... Our goal is to help them with this as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><strong>Brendan Ridings:  </strong>Brendan first traveled to Haiti in 2010. He was first hand witness to the conditions there. What cannot be imagined here is a living reality for children there. Brendan's aim is to empower the youth of Haiti so they have the tools to create the change they need. Brendan believes that by reaching across boarders and helping, this world economy can be affected and conditions here can be improved. Brendan has been involved with many charity organizations and fundraisers benefiting local, national, and international efforts. He is a nutritionist, NASM personal trainer, Corrective exercise specialist, CrossFit Level-1 trainer, and has done private practice counseling. This cause is also an effort to engage young people here to improve themselves, their community, and nation. Haiti is just the beginning. </p>
<p><strong>Eric Hargarten:  </strong>Eric joined the U.S. Air Force at age 17 and did six years active duty.  During that time some of his work included humanitarian and force protection work in Iraq and social work in Germany.  He was also a key physical training leader for the physical fitness development of Airmen.  He is a CrossFit Level-1 Trainer and ISSA Certified Fitness Trainer.  Eric has committed himself to a life of Service Before Self, and wishes to share his knowledge and compassion with the less fortunate.  He has seen firsthand the unfortunate disease and mis-education that is the result of living under an oppressive dictatorship.  He is a strong believer that in order to really affect positive change on a society, it starts with the education of young minds.  He just got out of the Air Force in May, and after much reading and education he knew that Haiti was his next project.  </p>
<p>Eric has previously done successful fundraising and volunteering for MS, prostate and testicular cancer, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Ronald McDonald House Charities, and the Special Olympics.</p>
<p><strong>Eric Ridings:  </strong>Eric is involved with Chicago Cares charity. Eric works within the community he lives and also wants to reach abroad. He works as a NASM personal trainer, Corrective exercise specialst, CSCS, and physique competitor. Eric believes in inspiring the individual and bringing change through individual transformation. ""One child at a time, and the entire world can change"". He hopes to inspire the youth he works with in Chicago by working in one of the poorest nations on this planet. </p>

Artists for Peace and Justice:  We are committed to long-term, sustainable development in direct partnership with the Haitian people. Our model is simple: we believe in empowering local communities, fostering economic growth, and the power of education to change a nation.
Angels of Light:  Under the NPH umbrella, the Father Wasson Angels of Light (FWAL) program founded the St. Anne Baby House and St. Louis Child Protection Camp. These homes have been a safe haven for the displaced and vulnerable children from Haiti’s devastating earthquake in 2010. Today, over 180 children underage 14 receive care, education and spiritual formation in the loving tradition of “St. Helene,” our flagship facility in Kenscoff, Haiti. Many of the grown children of St. Helene now serve as caregivers and teachers to this new generation of NPH children.
The organization Pwoteje Lavi Timoun yo (PLAT):  In Haiti, the children are growing up themselves in a harsh environment where the social, economic, and cultural conditions represent a shortfall for many of these children preventing them which are, inter alia: the right to housing, the right to health, the right to proper nutrition, the right to education.  Those most affected are: the orphans, the handicaps, the street children, the children in domestic situations, the abused children who are victims of ill treatments, the exploitation, violence and negligencing taking into account the mentality of the country or the medium in which they are in.
This alarming situation pushes them with the creation of the aforementioned organization to contribute their shares in order to mitigate these problems through their activities... Our goal is to help them with this as much as possible.
Who We Are
Brendan Ridings:  Brendan first traveled to Haiti in 2010. He was first hand witness to the conditions there. What cannot be imagined here is a living reality for children there. Brendan's aim is to empower the youth of Haiti so they have the tools to create the change they need. Brendan believes that by reaching across boarders and helping, this world economy can be affected and conditions here can be improved. Brendan has been involved with many charity organizations and fundraisers benefiting local, national, and international efforts. He is a nutritionist, NASM personal trainer, Corrective exercise specialist, CrossFit Level-1 trainer, and has done private practice counseling. This cause is also an effort to engage young people here to improve themselves, their community, and nation. Haiti is just the beginning. 
Eric Hargarten:  Eric joined the U.S. Air Force at age 17 and did six years active duty.  During that time some of his work included humanitarian and force protection work in Iraq and social work in Germany.  He was also a key physical training leader for the physical fitness development of Airmen.  He is a CrossFit Level-1 Trainer and ISSA Certified Fitness Trainer.  Eric has committed himself to a life of Service Before Self, and wishes to share his knowledge and compassion with the less fortunate.  He has seen firsthand the unfortunate disease and mis-education that is the result of living under an oppressive dictatorship.  He is a strong believer that in order to really affect positive change on a society, it starts with the education of young minds.  He just got out of the Air Force in May, and after much reading and education he knew that Haiti was his next project.  
Eric has previously done successful fundraising and volunteering for MS, prostate and testicular cancer, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Ronald McDonald House Charities, and the Special Olympics.
Eric Ridings:  Eric is involved with Chicago Cares charity. Eric works within the community he lives and also wants to reach abroad. He works as a NASM personal trainer, Corrective exercise specialst, CSCS, and physique competitor. Eric believes in inspiring the individual and bringing change through individual transformation. ""One child at a time, and the entire world can change"". He hopes to inspire the youth he works with in Chicago by working in one of the poorest nations on this planet.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is Yes To The Arts?</h3>
<p>Before I tell you what we are, let me explain how we came to be. I've been working in education for the past 15 years and a classroom teacher for 3 of those years. Over the years, I've noticed a disturbing trend: the arts were slowly being phased out the schools I worked in. The reason for this? Mainly budget cuts and growing focus on standardized testing. As schools re-shaped their schedules to add more hours of academics, time for the arts was either shortened or eliminated.<strong> I thought, what can I do?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>I stumbled upon a book called ""Start Something that Matters."" It was written by the guy who started TOMS shoes. Long story short, this book gave me the inspiration to start Yes To The Arts. What if I could start a business that could actually<strong> give the arts to schools</strong>? And, what could I sell to fund the program? It was very important to me to keep the program free, <strong>I strongly believe that the arts should always be a part of every child's public education.</strong> Our program follows a basic format. We bring in highly qualified dancers, actors, visual artists and musicians, and they teach mini-workshops in an after school setting.</p>
<p>So, I decided that a t-shirt would be the best and most appealing item to sell. Everyone wears them and it's the easiest way to spread our message. I didn't want to create a basic t-shirt, though. The t-shirt we created is a vintage-style light-weight cotton shirt; this way it fits into anyone's wardrobe. I want our customer to feel good when they buy it <em>and</em> when they wear it. <strong>Every shirt sold = one opportunity for a child to particpate in the program. 1 shirt, 1 opportunity. </strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p><strong>We need at least $5,000 to start. Here's where it will go:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing campaign: we need to get the word out. Your contribution will help us launch an aggressive campaign to attract schools who need our program and customers buy our shirts.</li>
<li>Supplies: In order to give our students a high quality program, we need supplies. Paints, recorders, sheet music, scripts etc. </li>
<li>T-shirts: We want to expand our brand. Right now we have 4 designs, we need more. We are currently working with a designer to create more choices for you.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<h3 class=""_mce_tagged_br"">The Impact</h3>
<p>There has never been a better time for a program like Yes to the Arts. Currently 20% of Arizona schools are without arts programming. And, that's just Arizona. Imagine what other states are dealing with. <strong>It's time to make positive change in our schools, and you can start by supporting a program like Yes to the Arts.  </strong>Here's how the arts have positive impact on students:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arts instruction provides an incentive to attend school. And, once the students are there they are more likely to be successful in other areas.</li>
<li>Arts instruction teaches logic, problem solving skills and teamwork.</li>
<li>Arts instruction helps students understand the world around them.</li>

<p>Hi!  My name is Kayla Johnson.  I'm a 13 year old, seventh grader, from Cordova (Memphis), TN.  I'm pretty normal, I guess.  I like to dance, listen to music, and hang out with friends at the mall.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, last summer, I got a letter from Duke University, inviting me to take the ACT ( a college entrance test).  My Mom and Dad were so excited, but all I could think of was, ""oh boy something else to study for"".  Well, I didn't study, but I did go to an ACT prep program that my Mom's sorority offered.  (My Mom is a Delta).  That program taught me <em>how</em> to take the test.  It must have worked because I did really well on the ACT. Actually, I rocked it!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last week I got a few letters, inviting me to go to a summer program for ""gifted students"".  I'm a good student, but I never thought of myself as ""gifted."" Pretty cool stuff, huh?  It sounds like a great opportunity and I <em>really</em> want to go.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope you will help.  Even if you cannot give anything, please forward my information to other people who may be able to help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My Mom always says, ""It takes a village to raise a child.""  <em><strong>Thanks for being a part of my village!</strong></em></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So, what happens if you give?  You will help me explore education from a different perspective.  I will be on a college campus, taking classes from a college professor, living in a dorm.  What more could a girl ask for?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need money.  About $5000.  I know it sounds like a lot, it is! The money will pay for the summer program and travel expenses (hopefully I get to fly).  If I don't raise all of the money, I hope my parents will be able to make up the difference.  I don't want to ask them yet, that's why I'm asking you.  I don't have much to give in return except a big <strong>Thank You</strong>, but I'm sure I will think of something.<br/></p>

To date, the Foundation has awarded an incredible 333 scholarships to academically gifted, highly motivated students whose dreams of higher education would have been in jeopardy without our scholarship program.  This program has existed through the generosity of individuals like you who understand that an education is the single most powerful weapon against ignorance, poverty, and crime—it can bridge social, economic, racial, and geographic divides like no other force on Earth.  
Many of our students are first-generation college students who greatly desire to change the course of their lives by way of higher education.  Most have overcome extreme challenges and  major hardships in their personal lives.  All of them are extraordinary individuals who have worked hard, fought against the odds, and proven themselves Scholars in the truest sense of the word.
The Project: Simon Saves
For many years, we at The Simon Estes Educational Foundation, Inc. have been told by our supporters that the stories of our Simon Estes Scholars confirm the positive impact that our program has had on their lives. We heard them! Unfortunately, the staggering cost of creating such a collection of touching narratives has been prohibitive.
Until now.
Thanks to an extraordinary offer of a reduced fee, we are in the process of producing a first-rate documentary chronicling the sometimes harrowing, sometimes heartbreaking, always inspiring stories of our beloved scholars. However, we have yet to raise the funds needed for promotion and circulation.
That’s where we need YOU!
With your help, we can share these poignant tales of hope with the world.

Millions of ancient manuscripts from Timbuktu and the Great Empires of West Africa radically changed the image and legacy of Africans and African Americans in world history.
Dismissed for centuries as simple and illiterate by the West, a flood of recently resurfaced documents in Africa clearly prove the existence of highly literate and complex societies that valued education more than their vast reserves of gold.
The most significant benefit of the exhibit is the documented knowledge that African Americans will learn, particularly the youth, of the literacy of their ancestors and the positive contributions that Africans made to the world community. 
Return proof of great accomplishments of direct relatives from the past to engage kids and adults with the confidence and sense of self to do great things in the future. We all benefit.

I am a 22-year-old living in Yuma (AZ) who has decided (with a lot of God's nudging's, and kicks and pushes, haha) to launch in an indefinite journey as a missionary. <br/>If you do not know what a missionary does, here's a brief explanation: anything and everything. <br/>To be honest, for now, all I know is that the following six months will include some strong teachings, but a whole lot of something else. You see, I will become the hands and feet for things many others require payments for doing, and do it for free. Whether it is building houses, or teaching, or just having a conversation over a cup of coffee with someone who's hurting. I will go to the places where I'm called to do whatever is needed. <br/>Missionary work is different for everyone, and for me, the case stands. <br/>For me, missionary work is a piece of cake, that is, if it revolves around people who are in immediate need (like Hatians, living in tiny cottages in the DR). I find it easy to sit on the floor in a house with no windows, and play with half-naked children even if they look like they haven't showered for days. Don't get me wrong, there are still plenty challenges to that type of missionary work, but for me, it is the one in which I am most comfortable. <br/>That is why, when I felt called to go to England of all places, I sort of panicked. This means I don't just get to knock on someone's door or give a dollar to a kid I'll never again see in my life. It means I create a relationship and keep it going. It means I come into a person's life and not leave it, and act on what I preach, not just say it. <br/>Thus, I am highly excited about this opportunity to attend DTS in London. I will be in a place far away from home where I will be left with nothing but to learn and start acting, instead of just sitting in my bubble of comfort. I am actually going out into the world and using what I learn to hopefully change people's lives for the better, and to be honest, it's about time. It's about time I become one less person who talks and talks but doesn't do. I am really excited about going out there and doing, even if I don't know what it is until I'm there. I am ready, and I hope you are ready to come with me, because whether it is only in spirit, through your support, you will be there with me every step of the way. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>All funding received will be put towards paying for the school phase as well as an outreach phase all through YWAM. Anything else will be saved for any future trip opportunities. <br/>Funding for this is, in a way, a one way street. You will not get any money or such in return. It is my hope, though, that my visit there will be enough to make the difference in at least one person's life, and if that is the case, that difference will have been made not only by me, but by you through your funding. Because without you, I might have not been there. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Personally, this will be a great opportunity for me to grow. I will be learning how to communicate and work with people better, as well as create a form of discipline in my life. <br/>Not only that, but I get to interact with new people and establish a (hopefully) lasting relationship, regardless of their religious affiliation. <br/>I hope to create an impact and learn how to use my gifts and talents to help those around me. </p><p>With this training, I can launch in an indefinite journey of travel to places in need of my help.

<h3>Hi everyone!  Thanks for taking the time to check out our campaign.</h3>
<p><strong>This summer Statement Arts is teaming up with the legendary Malcolm X &amp; Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center to provide a</strong> <strong>free summer music and theater program for 50 underserved New York City kids!</strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Need:</strong></h2>
<p>Many public school students in New York Cities' underserved communities have little or no access to the Arts. There is a real need to empower underserved, minority and low-income youth through arts education that goes beyond the classroom. Often times when budgets are tight, music and arts programs are the very first things to get cut and sadly, there are many kids in New York City with no music or arts classes at all!</p>
<h2>We Can Help...</h2>
<p>At <a href=""http://www.statementarts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Statement Arts,</a> a 501(c)(3) located in New York City, we recognize the importance of a well-rounded liberal arts education and we hope that our new Summer Program, <em>Empower Youth Through Performance</em>, will introduce kids to musical theater, igniting their creative fire. Partnering with the Malcolm X &amp; Dr. Betty Shabazz Cultural Center<strong>,</strong> <em>Empower Youth Through Performance</em> will work with 40–50 students, grades 3-6 and 7-9, over the course of two weeks.</p>
<p>We also plan to launch a <strong>college prep program</strong> for 10 kids!</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>Putting on a summer program for 50 kids in NYC is a challenge! All funding obtained for this project will go towards the renting the space, a piano/keyboard, lights, chairs for the final performance for our audience, food for the reception, paying the teaching artists, insurance and if we raise the whole amount, tickets for the kids to see a show on Broadway!</p>
<p>Any additional money raised, will got towards other Statement Arts programs. Whatever you are able to give- $10, $50, or $200, we promise it will make an impact.</p>
<p><em><a href=""http://www.statementarts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Statement Arts</a> would like to offer every student an equal chance to participate at no cost to them.</em>                                                                         </p>
<h3><strong> As a 501(c)(3), all money donated to Statement Arts is tax-deductible!</strong></h3>
<div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Students who have participated in our programs have had many successes, such as a Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Millennium Scholarship recipient, Honor Roll and National Honors Society members, a Sundance Film Festival participant, and most have gone onto higher learning institutions. </p>
<p>Funding for this and upcoming projects will enable Statement Arts to open a larger umbrella securing more young artists’ education projects, underwriting the cost of mentoring activities, and ensuring a plan that will sustain new projects in 2012 and years to come.</p>

<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.statementarts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Statement Arts</a> is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose mission is to build self confidence and enrich underserved youth with creative experiences through arts education: Music, acting, dance, photography, visual art, filmmaking and writing. We believe that these arts education channels enhance young people's intellectual performance and self esteem, enabling them to become ambassadors in their communities.</p>
<p>For the past ten years, our core focus has been the <em>Urban Arts Project</em>, which filled the immediate needs of the art and music programs at the High School of Environmental Studies (HSES), an underserved public school in New York City’s Hell’s Kitchen.</p>

All funding obtained for this project will go towards the renting the space, a piano/keyboard, lights, chairs for the final performance for our audience, food for the reception, paying the teaching artists, insurance and if we raise the whole amount, tickets for the kids to see a show on Broadway!
Any additional money raised, will got towards other Statement Arts programs. Whatever you are able to give- $10, $50, or $200, we promise it will make an impact.
Statement Arts would like to offer every student an equal chance to participate at no cost to them.                                                                         
 As a 501(c)(3), all money donated to Statement Arts is tax-deductible!

The Impact
Students who have participated in our programs have had many successes, such as a Bill & Melinda Gates Millennium Scholarship recipient, Honor Roll and National Honors Society members, a Sundance Film Festival participant, and most have gone onto higher learning institutions. 
Funding for this and upcoming projects will enable Statement Arts to open a larger umbrella securing more young artists’ education projects, underwriting the cost of mentoring activities, and ensuring a plan that will sustain new projects in 2012 and years to come.

Other Ways You Can Help
Sharing this campaign with your friends can really make a difference. Please help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.  Like us on facebook, tweet about us, forward our campaign on to all of your friends.

We'd like to thank everyone who helps us with this program and we look forward to empowering many more kids in the future.

About Us
Statement Arts is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose mission is to build self confidence and enrich underserved youth with creative experiences through arts education: Music, acting, dance, photography, visual art, filmmaking and writing. We believe that these arts education channels enhance young people's intellectual performance and self esteem, enabling them to become ambassadors in their communities.
For the past ten years, our core focus has been the Urban Arts Project, which filled the immediate needs of the art and music programs at the High School of Environmental Studies (HSES), an underserved public school in New York City’s Hell’s Kitchen.

<p>Hi, My name is Felicia. The pic you see above is my son Quincy. Quin is attending Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) for photography.  I am his mom and I am funding his education alone with the help of financial aid and loans which still do not cover all the costs. SCAD is $52,000 per year and has posed a financial hardship on me but I believe in my son and feel that he should have the opportunity to follow his dream. I managed to get him through two of the three quarters by using my 401k and any other money I had. We lowered his course load to be able to pay his tuition but this last quarter I was unable to pay the last $5000.00 that he owed. I am asking for an additional $1000.00 just to send with him to obtain a place to live, food and books for the upcoming year. As it stands now Quin cannot return to school until I clear this debt. I am working to provide a place for us to live and pay the household bills. Quin has a part-time job and he is saving to get a place to live because we cannot afford the on campus housing. This campaign is my last hope to send him back to school. It is my hope that you will read this and be moved to help us. Quincy will not be going to school anywhere if we cannot come up with the funds to at least satisfy the debt he owes. I cannot express the hope that I am putting into this plea for assistance. I don't have any other resource to turn to. I think if 6000 people read this and everyone gives just a dollar we will make our goal. I'm hoping that 6000 people and $1.00 can change my son's life. He doesn't know that I am doing this but if I could tell him that 6000 people cared enough about his future to give, I think that would change him profoundly.  Anything we raise will go to clearing his school debt. If you cannot give, please pass the word about this campaign. You will be giving to us still. Thank you for reading this and thank you for giving.</p>

The WI- Kerala Connection 

Growing Networks is an international collaborative that seeks to bring the wealth of  aquaponic farming - system of growing fish and plants in a re-circulating water system- to communities world-wide- starting in Kerala, India.  By creating glocal networks in which, information, ideas, and resources around aquaponics can be exchanged, Growing Networks will aid in the re-imagination of the world food system to encourage local production and consumption of highly nutritious food that promotes the values of the triple bottom line, and emphasizes the need for multi-diciplnary education that integrates environmental stewardship, nutrition, and food production.

 
The Growing Networks pilot project “Empowerment through Aquaponics- The Wisconsin- Kerala Aquaponics Connection” will progress in the summer of 2012, through collaboration between Sweet Water Foundation, Mahattil, LLC, the University of WI- Madison, and St. Albert’s College of Kochi, India.  
 
The program will introduce a group of UW-Madison student interns to the sustainable development of aquaponics in India, through a service-learning project.  The students will

Build the first aquaponics system at an aquaculture institute in Kochi, India.  
Transform the wet lab at the University featured below into an aquaponics learning center.  





Build a scalable system, that is adapted to local markets and can be used to educate the community on the promise of aquaponic farming.


 

Engage in Interdiciplinary learning via the Sweet Water AQUAPONS curriculum (diagramed below) 

We need your support!  We have recieved an award from UW-Madison to make this project possible, but need more funding to make this project sustainable and scalable.  Our project is
Locally Rooted



We are working with students, and a local university to construct a system that is adaptable to the culture and environment of Kerala


Environmentally concious



Aquaponics has the unique ability to produce large amounts of highly nutritious fish and produce while addressing problems such as drought, overfishing, and environmental stress caused by traditional agricultural methods


Education Based



Aquaponics is an ideal tool by which to teach the STEM (Science Technology, Engineering, and Math) diciplines.  


Your donation will help us teach local communities about a practical technology that they can take command of and adapt to thier environment and culture.  
 
Why Aquaponics? 

holds promise in creating sustainable food systems that yield large amounts of quality produce, and fish (which can begin to address overfishing), 
does not produce significant amounts of waste product that not only harms the environment but the health of populations.  
is adaptable and can be made in any size and shape aquaponics makes it plausible to grow food locally-from small areas in classrooms and houses to large factory cultivation.  
We deeply believe that the introduction of Aquaponic farming will transform communities in that itis minimally water intensive compared to traditional agriculture, thus addressing major issues of drought and erratic monsoon, while allowing communities to be innovative with the system, growing both cash crops, and nutritious produce to feed their families. Additionally, Aquaponics can be used within the classroom as an educational tool to teach students about Science, Engineering, Math, and Technology and Art. Our partner, Sweet Water Foundation, is now creating a full curriculum platform that we will be using to bring aquaponics to schools in India as well called AQUAPONS funded by the MacArthur foundation and HASTAC.  
 
Why Growing Networks?
Growing Networks is a collaborative.  We operate on the core belief that in order to create sustaianble change we have to engage various groups, organizations, communities, and people in the movement.  Growing Networks seeks to connect people who are interested in the fledgling aquaponics industry to those who have already established themselves as key players.  Our key collaborators include:
Sweet Water Foundation
Sweet Water Organics
Mahattil LLC
St. Alberts College
UW-Madison
Kottapuram Integrated Development Society (KIDS)

Our Team aditionally has experience working in India to promote aquaponics.  James Godsil, president of Sweet Water Foundation, and co-founder of Sweet Water Organics, was sponsored by the State Department to speak on Aquaponics in India.  Chaya Nayak, the co-organizer of Growing Networks, spent a year in India studying the feasibility of Aquaponics in 2010.  

 
We are constantly bringing in new contributors both at the local and global level and seek to create networks of networks because it is with these networks that we can truly provide resources to communities so that they can adapt aquaponics.  By contributing to our project you will become a part of the NETWORK.  
 
In the News! 
Aquaponics and the Sweet Water Foundation/ Sweet Water Organics model have been heralded by the UN World Cities Program, IBM, and the Economist, as an emerging method of food production that has the potential to impact not only food security, but also education, jobs, and the general health of communities. Sweet Water Foundation has additionally recieved grants from the USDA and HASTAC's digital media learning competition.

We Need YOUR help:
This campaign will help us raise funds to help us the first aquaponics test system in Kochi, India.  
We hope to surpass our goal of $8000 and reach our goal of $12000 to allow for aquaponics experts to accompany the students to Cochin, and oversee the project, as well as additional funds to allow for maintenance of and research around the system the students create, and the purchase of a locally produced solar panel to offset the barrier of electricity to power the system.   

Your contribution will help us begin to develop a model to train communities to take command of the technology and promote a local movement to create a healthy food system, while also impacting their educational system.  By supporting us in our first endeavor, you will be forming the base of the initiative, and allow us to conduct thorough research that will be used to create a sustainable social enterprise that can be replicated not only in other Indian cities, but in other countries as well.

<p>Currently, the students that I have in my <strong><em>Inner-City Program </em></strong>in East Harlem<strong><em>,</em></strong> in which I teach 4 days a week of two groups of ten students, will have their Blue Belt Promotion Test this coming March. However, the student’s parents whom are low-income I will not ask to cover their kid’s Promotion Test, because I do not wish to burden them with an expense that they cannot afford. Moreover, I cannot afford to cover the belts myself since my Org. is only 2 years old; i.e., newly formed.  Nevertheless, one day in the future, I will be able to finance my deshis (disciples) Karate is all aspects, that is my aspiration, but for now, I or more aptly stated, <strong>THEY</strong> need assistance.</p>
<p><br/>Subsequently, I humbly request funding for my deshis’ test. This benevolence is greatly appreciated by me and will be on behalf of my deshis and it will cover the cost of the belts (obis) with embroidery (the names of the students) on them.</p>
<p><br/>So far, this program is going well (again) and it has been received very well by the aforesaid students as well as the school. Not to mention, I have the largest group(s) of kids too! Additionally, I am hoping that over this summer that the school implements summer programming.</p>
<h2>Benevolence</h2>
<p>Again, I beseech your help and I hope that you can be so kind as to assist them in their Karated<span class=""notranslate"">ō</span> experience, so I can give them a true test and reward them with their deserved ranks, because I teach them at a low hourly rate, which is fine and agreed to do. Furthermore, I assure you that they will be thrilled as they are already excited about potentially testing as they inquired about already, and in which,  I expressed that I am trying to get the funding to manifest this: their test.</p>
<p><br/>Thankfully, this is my Organization’s 4th school program and second Inner-City one, but the first one covered the fees for the discounted Promotion Test fees as I had 30 middle and high school students!</p>

I have worked in non-profits serving pre-teens, teens, and transitional age youth (youth age 18-24), for over 10 years. Here in the East Bay of California, which includes Oakland and Richmond, many of our youth are being left to deal with violence, racism, poverty, and abuse, on their own. I hope to fill that gap.

<p>Your founding will help my pay for the first few months of office space in a location accessible by public transportation. It will pay for art supplies, journals, and games. I have found that most youth respond best to creative based therapies. And it will pay for basic office supplies such as lockable file cabinets, a lockable brief case and other basic essentials. Any funds will help. If I don't make my goal it will still get me farther along the way. I am committed to this goal. If I don't get funds it will mean I cannot immediatley provide the breadth of services I would like to provide.</p>
<p>Children in this area, as well as the surrounding areas are regularly exposed to violence, drugs, abuse, racism, and sexual exploitation. If they don't come across a non profit agency they are left to deal with these issues on their own.

<div>Huntridge lovers, wondering what's the latest with the Theatre?  What did the crowdfunding money go to?  And what about that million bucks from the City, is that still there?
<p></p>
<p>Well, we all know nothing good comes easy, and if anything this project is confirmation of just how GREAT the Huntridge is!  It's been quite a rollercoaster, but rest assured Huntridge Revival and a dedicated team of supporters are still working hard to put the puzzle pieces together and bring our beloved Huntridge back to life. 
</p>
<p>The good news is we've found a new investment group that's very capable, wants to move quickly, and has aligned interests in the historical significance and future use.  We are working through the financials and due diligence with them and hope to have some good news soon!
</p>
</div>
<p>The crowdfunding money raised was used for ongoing deposits on the property, legal work, administration costs, and for basic exterior improvements (paint and lighting) to help alleviate the blight.  Thanks again to everyone who contributed, as this seed capital was the thing that made this project possible!
</p>
<p>The $1 million grant from the City of Las Vegas via the Centennial Commission is still earmarked for the project.  Special thanks to the efforts of Councilman Bob Coffin who has been spearheading it.  Additional thanks are due to the rest of the City Council, and the Centennial Commission including Councilman Ricki Barlow, Historical Preservationist Bob Stodal, Mayor Carolyn Goodman, and the other members who have all been very supportive of the cause.  We also want to thank the Huntridge Foundation for all of their ongoing efforts to document and preserve the historical significance of the Huntridge.  This is truly a community-wide project and it takes the support of so many to keep it alive.
</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates, and good news, coming soon!
</p>
</div><p>-Huntridge Revival</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">____________________________________________</p><p><br/></p><p>The Huntridge Theater may be the most beloved historic landmark in Las Vegas. But over the last decade, the community that loves it has watched it helplessly fall into a seeming final state of disrepair.  </p>
<p>El Teatro Huntridge es el sitio histórico más querido de Las Vegas. Pero en la última década, la comunidad que lo aprecia lo ha visto caer en un total estado de abandono. Queremos traerlo a su gloria  de nuevo y que se convierta una vez más en el sitio preferido en Las Vegas para las artes y programas comunitarios.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>We want to end this madness, and bring The Huntridge back for the people that love it. </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We plan to bring this Theatre back to all its glory and more, and make it once again Las Vegas' favorite venue for performing arts and community programming.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The downtown entrepreneurs who undertook to kick off this effort recognize that many attempts to do this have failed despite concerted efforts and massive, long-term community support, and this might be the last shot to save it (covenants on the property expire in 2017). But the tools for organizing community engagement and support have evolved so much, so quickly -- we can do this.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Even if we raise this campaign’s full amount and end up with $150,000 or more, that’s obviously not even close to enough to lovingly renovate, and reopen, or even buy the Huntridge.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><em>But!</em> It will prove that community support exists to justify much larger private investment in a project that is motivated more by passion than just profits.<br/><br/>It will give us a great shot at getting the $4M in the door to secure the property that the current owners are asking for before the end of the year. Once the Mizrachis no longer own it, the process of working with the community to renovate it together can begin, without particular time pressure. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Renovating the Huntridge could cost up to $10 million more (based on initial engineers' walkthrough of the guttend building), so if we can show interested investors how much the community still cares about the Huntridge by raising the <em>first ~1% of the to cost from its fans</em>, and in doing so pass smaller initial financial hurdles that are beyond our personal means, we are confident that this show of community support will preface a beautiful revival of the greatest music and arts venue Vegas has ever known.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Nostalgic Huntridge-lovers of all stripes, this is where you come in</span><span>: <em>Help us prove that community support is there, by funding the important pre-work of this iconic revival project!!!</em></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong><strong><strong>Queremos acabar con esta locura y devolver el Huntridge a la gente que lo aprecia.</strong></strong> </strong></p>
<p>Los miembros de la Comunidad de Negocios del Centro de Las Vegas que están detrás de esta iniciativa, reconocen que muchos intentos para lograrlo han fracasado a pesar de esfuerzos conjuntos y un enorme apoyo de la comunidad, y esta es quizás la última oportunidad de salvarlo (el contrato de la propiedad se vence en el 2017). La capacidad para organizar el apoyo de la comunidad ha evolucionado rápidamente y sabemos que podemos lograrlo!</p>
<p>Si aumentamos el monto de la campaña a $150.000 o más, no es ni siquiera suficiente para comprar, renovar y abrir de nuevo el Huntridge.</p>
<p>Pero! Comprobará que el apoyo de la comunidad existe, y así justificar una gran inversión privada en este proyecto que está motivado más por pasión que por ganancias.<br/>Comprar y renovar el Huntridge puede costar unos $15 millones de dólares, y si podemos demostrar a los inversionistas que están interesados, lo mucho que la comunidad quiere salvar al Huntridge al recolectar el 1% del dinero por los miembros de la comunidad, y de esta manera cubrir la inversión inicial que está por encima de lo que nosotros podemos cubrir.<br/>Tenemos la plena confianza que esta muestra de apoyo de la comunidad será el comienzo de la bella recuperación del mejor escenario para la música y las artes que Vegas ha tenido hasta ahora.</p>
<p>Para todos los nostálgicos amantes del Huntridge esto es donde necesitamos de su ayuda:<br/>Ayúdenos a comprobar que el apoyo de la comunidad existe, contribuyendo a la recuperación de este gran icono.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>What do we need the money for?</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We extended all our personal financial resources to come up with the first $60k for the non-refundable deposit and appraisals to make this process possible. The next chunk of deposit ($50k) is due immediately after this campaign ends, and we have an estimated $100k of required costs before we can start bringing in (already very interested) private investors for the project. These costs include remediation due diligence, environmental certifications, appraisals, legal work, renovation design work and marketing materials, etc, all by the end of the summer. These start-up costs would normally be much more for a project of this magnitude, but we expect that we'll be able to get it all done very efficiently thanks to many tentative offers we've received to volunteer professional services.  Estimated costs are as follows:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>$20k - Due Diligence / Feasibility Studies  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>$15k - Marketing / Web Development / Admin</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">$50k - Architectural / Design / Engineering</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">$15k - Inspections / Appraisals / admin</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">$50k - Second Deposit</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>$150k Total Start-up Capital Required</strong></p>
<p><strong>Para que necesitamos el dinero?</strong></p>
<p>Nuestro grupo ha reunido todos nuestros recursos disponibles y contamos con los primeros $60.000 para el depósito y estudio de valorización no reembolsable para poder iniciar este proyecto.<br/>Los próximos $50.000 deben pagarse inmediatamente al finalizar esta campaña, y hay costos estimados de $100.000 antes de poder presentar el proyecto a inversionistas privados que ya están muy interesados. Estos costos incluyen: certificados de ambiente, valorización, documentos legales, diseño del proyecto de renovación y materiales de mercadeo, todo esto debe hacerse al finalizar el verano.<br/>Estos costos iniciales suelen ser mucho más altos para un proyecto de esta magnitud, pero esperamos hacerlo de la manera más eficiente gracias a las ofertas tentativas que hemos recibido de profesionales que donaran ciertos servicios.<br/>Estos son los costos estimados:</p>
<p>$20.000 – Auditoría externa / Estudios de factibilidad</p>
<p>$15.000 – Mercadeo / Desarrollo página web / Administración</p>
<p>$50.000 – Arquitectura / Diseño / Ingeniería</p>
<p>$15.000 – Inspecciones / Valorización / Administración</p>
<p>$50.000 – Segundo depósito</p>
<p><strong>$150.000 Total del capital Inicial requerido</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">No, Huntridge Revival is an LLC because this campaign is only a necessary first step towards raising up to $15MM in total investment and it needs to also attract private investors and be able to show returns.  Because it is not a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization contributions are not tax-deductible.  To avoid ever rehashing its current fate if we do nothing, the Huntridge does need to sustain itself financially once reopened (while keeping ticket and food and beverage costs affordable). </p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""> </h2></div>","UPDATE
Huntridge lovers, wondering what's the latest with the Theatre?  What did the crowdfunding money go to?  And what about that million bucks from the City, is that still there?

Well, we all know nothing good comes easy, and if anything this project is confirmation of just how GREAT the Huntridge is!  It's been quite a rollercoaster, but rest assured Huntridge Revival and a dedicated team of supporters are still working hard to put the puzzle pieces together and bring our beloved Huntridge back to life. 

The good news is we've found a new investment group that's very capable, wants to move quickly, and has aligned interests in the historical significance and future use.  We are working through the financials and due diligence with them and hope to have some good news soon!


The crowdfunding money raised was used for ongoing deposits on the property, legal work, administration costs, and for basic exterior improvements (paint and lighting) to help alleviate the blight.  Thanks again to everyone who contributed, as this seed capital was the thing that made this project possible!

The $1 million grant from the City of Las Vegas via the Centennial Commission is still earmarked for the project.  Special thanks to the efforts of Councilman Bob Coffin who has been spearheading it.  Additional thanks are due to the rest of the City Council, and the Centennial Commission including Councilman Ricki Barlow, Historical Preservationist Bob Stodal, Mayor Carolyn Goodman, and the other members who have all been very supportive of the cause.  We also want to thank the Huntridge Foundation for all of their ongoing efforts to document and preserve the historical significance of the Huntridge.  This is truly a community-wide project and it takes the support of so many to keep it alive.

Stay tuned for more updates, and good news, coming soon!

-Huntridge Revival____________________________________________The Huntridge Theater may be the most beloved historic landmark in Las Vegas. But over the last decade, the community that loves it has watched it helplessly fall into a seeming final state of disrepair.  
El Teatro Huntridge es el sitio histórico más querido de Las Vegas. Pero en la última década, la comunidad que lo aprecia lo ha visto caer en un total estado de abandono. Queremos traerlo a su gloria  de nuevo y que se convierta una vez más en el sitio preferido en Las Vegas para las artes y programas comunitarios.
We want to end this madness, and bring The Huntridge back for the people that love it. 
We plan to bring this Theatre back to all its glory and more, and make it once again Las Vegas' favorite venue for performing arts and community programming.
The downtown entrepreneurs who undertook to kick off this effort recognize that many attempts to do this have failed despite concerted efforts and massive, long-term community support, and this might be the last shot to save it (covenants on the property expire in 2017). But the tools for organizing community engagement and support have evolved so much, so quickly -- we can do this.
Even if we raise this campaign’s full amount and end up with $150,000 or more, that’s obviously not even close to enough to lovingly renovate, and reopen, or even buy the Huntridge.
But! It will prove that community support exists to justify much larger private investment in a project that is motivated more by passion than just profits.It will give us a great shot at getting the $4M in the door to secure the property that the current owners are asking for before the end of the year. Once the Mizrachis no longer own it, the process of working with the community to renovate it together can begin, without particular time pressure. 
Renovating the Huntridge could cost up to $10 million more (based on initial engineers' walkthrough of the guttend building), so if we can show interested investors how much the community still cares about the Huntridge by raising the first ~1% of the to cost from its fans, and in doing so pass smaller initial financial hurdles that are beyond our personal means, we are confident that this show of community support will preface a beautiful revival of the greatest music and arts venue Vegas has ever known.
Nostalgic Huntridge-lovers of all stripes, this is where you come in: Help us prove that community support is there, by funding the important pre-work of this iconic revival project!!!
Queremos acabar con esta locura y devolver el Huntridge a la gente que lo aprecia. 
Los miembros de la Comunidad de Negocios del Centro de Las Vegas que están detrás de esta iniciativa, reconocen que muchos intentos para lograrlo han fracasado a pesar de esfuerzos conjuntos y un enorme apoyo de la comunidad, y esta es quizás la última oportunidad de salvarlo (el contrato de la propiedad se vence en el 2017). La capacidad para organizar el apoyo de la comunidad ha evolucionado rápidamente y sabemos que podemos lograrlo!
Si aumentamos el monto de la campaña a $150.000 o más, no es ni siquiera suficiente para comprar, renovar y abrir de nuevo el Huntridge.
Pero! Comprobará que el apoyo de la comunidad existe, y así justificar una gran inversión privada en este proyecto que está motivado más por pasión que por ganancias.Comprar y renovar el Huntridge puede costar unos $15 millones de dólares, y si podemos demostrar a los inversionistas que están interesados, lo mucho que la comunidad quiere salvar al Huntridge al recolectar el 1% del dinero por los miembros de la comunidad, y de esta manera cubrir la inversión inicial que está por encima de lo que nosotros podemos cubrir.Tenemos la plena confianza que esta muestra de apoyo de la comunidad será el comienzo de la bella recuperación del mejor escenario para la música y las artes que Vegas ha tenido hasta ahora.
Para todos los nostálgicos amantes del Huntridge esto es donde necesitamos de su ayuda:Ayúdenos a comprobar que el apoyo de la comunidad existe, contribuyendo a la recuperación de este gran icono.
 
What do we need the money for?
We extended all our personal financial resources to come up with the first $60k for the non-refundable deposit and appraisals to make this process possible. The next chunk of deposit ($50k) is due immediately after this campaign ends, and we have an estimated $100k of required costs before we can start bringing in (already very interested) private investors for the project. These costs include remediation due diligence, environmental certifications, appraisals, legal work, renovation design work and marketing materials, etc, all by the end of the summer. These start-up costs would normally be much more for a project of this magnitude, but we expect that we'll be able to get it all done very efficiently thanks to many tentative offers we've received to volunteer professional services.  Estimated costs are as follows:
$20k - Due Diligence / Feasibility Studies  
$15k - Marketing / Web Development / Admin
$50k - Architectural / Design / Engineering
$15k - Inspections / Appraisals / admin
$50k - Second Deposit
$150k Total Start-up Capital Required
Para que necesitamos el dinero?
Nuestro grupo ha reunido todos nuestros recursos disponibles y contamos con los primeros $60.000 para el depósito y estudio de valorización no reembolsable para poder iniciar este proyecto.Los próximos $50.000 deben pagarse inmediatamente al finalizar esta campaña, y hay costos estimados de $100.000 antes de poder presentar el proyecto a inversionistas privados que ya están muy interesados. Estos costos incluyen: certificados de ambiente, valorización, documentos legales, diseño del proyecto de renovación y materiales de mercadeo, todo esto debe hacerse al finalizar el verano.Estos costos iniciales suelen ser mucho más altos para un proyecto de esta magnitud, pero esperamos hacerlo de la manera más eficiente gracias a las ofertas tentativas que hemos recibido de profesionales que donaran ciertos servicios.Estos son los costos estimados:
$20.000 – Auditoría externa / Estudios de factibilidad
$15.000 – Mercadeo / Desarrollo página web / Administración
$50.000 – Arquitectura / Diseño / Ingeniería
$15.000 – Inspecciones / Valorización / Administración
$50.000 – Segundo depósito
$150.000 Total del capital Inicial requerido

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>   Hello! My name is Krystal Thomas and I was just accepted into a Dual Degree Masters program for George Mason University and the University of Malta. In this accelerated Masters Program, I receive two Masters degrees in one year: a Masters of Science from George Mason University in Conflict Analysis and Resolution and a Masters of the Arts from the University of Malta in Conflict Resolution and Mediterranean Security. Not only will I be participating in such a competitive program, but will be completing my degrees overseas in the beautiful country of Malta.</p>
<p>   After earning my Bachelors degrees in Psychology and Conflict Analysis and Resolution, I discovered my strong passion for conducting research on conflicts based on identity, culture, beauty, self worth, and values. My goal as a researcher is to help people be able to better understand themselves and others around them who may be similar or different. I want to talk about the social issues that affect marginalized groups in our population in the hopes of giving them a voice. This will create a better environment to actually move towards constructive resolution.</p>
<p>   The moment I heard about this program, I knew it was the right one for me. Not only will I learn more about analyzing and resolving conflicts around the world, but also I will be submerged in a brand new environment. After spending last summer overseas in Indonesia in a graduate level study abroad program titled: “Indonesia: Culture and Conflict,” I truly appreciate the opportunity of learning in a new location. My experience in Indonesia allowed me to not only become a better researcher and conflict analyst, but enabled me to grow as a person. This allowed me to realize the type of work I wanted to spend the rest of my life doing. I am so excited to be given the opportunity to further my education in Malta.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>    I have already been accepted into the University of Malta Dual Degree Program with George Mason University. Due to the fact this is an accelerated Masters program, I am not allowed to work during the program. I have applied for loans to cover my tuition for the year so now the only expense that I have left is to pay for an apartment and living expenses such as groceries and public transportation.</p>
<p>   For one year an apartment around 500 euros ($662.20) will be roughly $8,000.00 without water and electricity. Water and electricity would be roughly another 100 euros per month ($1,590.00).</p>
<p>    Because of the short time frame, I decided to set the goal for $4,000.00, but all donations are welcomed. This will not entirely cover all my expenses, but it will be extremely helpful for paying several months rent. I truly appreciate all of the support no matter the costs. I have been so blessed so far in my life and I am excited to see what is next. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>   I have already made progress in this area. As an undergraduate student, I created two original research studies. I have done the most with my research study titled Black Women Making and Breaking the Mold: The Influence of Stereotypes on Identity. From this study alone, I was able to not only present my findings in several conferences; I created a group on campus. The goal of this group was to create a sense of sisterhood amongst the women who participated in my research study in the hopes of empowering them to confront many of the issues within the Black community. After each group session, I would blog about our discussions in hopes of inspiring others to take action in confronting negative societal stereotypes about Black women.</p>
<p>   Since the creation of the blog and inspirational video, we have had the opportunity to reach so many women around the world. This has created such an impact because we have made a safe space for Black women to talk about issues and form a sense of sisterhood with other women with similar experiences to them. My work has only just started. I am hoping to continue writing about my research and experience within the group. While in Malta, I will continue doing similar research by analyzing the ongoing conflict of mass immigration of North Africans into Malta. I want to look into how this is impacting Maltese society and how immigrants from North African are adopting to life in Malta. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>   Honestly, thank you so much for taking the time to read my campaign. I understand if you are unable to make a financial contribution now, but you can still help! I ask that you talk to family and friends about my campaign and what I hope to do – make a tremendous impact in the Conflict Analysis field by focusing on issues on culture and identity. Together, we can really make a difference by bringing to light conflicts in the hopes of moving towards resolution.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hey guys, my name is James Tucker, and I am a junior in college. This July, through my school, I’ll have the privilege of traveling with a team of fellow students and faculty to China. For the majority of the trip, we will be teaching an English summer course at a university in China. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>For the trip, each student is required to raise $2,900 in funds by sending out support letters to various individuals. This covers the airfare and all the miscellaneous expenses we'll each have while we are in China such as food. The lodging is being covered by the university we are staying at.</p>
<p>The reason why I have created this project is because my funds were due last week, yet I am still only at 13% support.<strong> If I don't raise the remaining $2,500 within a week, I'll most likely be taken off the team.</strong> Would you please consider supporting me? If 500 folks were to each donate $5, my goal would be reached. At this point of time, even $1 goes a long way. If I end up not reaching my goal of $2500, any funds that have contributed will be refunded back to the donors.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to support me, I totally understand. I do, however, ask for one more thing. I truly covet your prayers. One, please pray that the funds will come in, if that's what God wants. Secondly, if I make it to China, please pray that we will be able to share the good news. </p>

<blockquote><b>The Song ""Don't Be A Drop-Out!""  Recorded by James Brown, August 1966 </b></blockquote>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I am Daryl Brown, the Son of James Brown, gifted musically,
funky by blood and one of only two children named in his will who is a
musician.  I've traveled around the world with my dad twice.  The picture shown here on Indiegogo is me playing the
drums my father sent Christmas 1968.  Dad
also sent a guitar which he challenged me to learn to play so that I could one
day grace the stage with him, and that dream came true.  </span><br/></p>
<p>My love
for music is so intense that I would skip high school to attend Rutgers College
and study music under the tutelage of Music Professors in Brunswick, NJ.  After mom and dads’ sudden transition(s), an
unsuccessful musical venture, and seven long years of litigation regarding Dad’s
will I lost my musical ambitions.  May
2013 the South Carolina Supreme Court remanded the case back to Aiken County
stating the 2000 will is to be honored, yet nothing has been paid out to send under privileged kids and his grand kids to college.  This catalyst has
sparked a torch in me to pick up and move forward and honor my father’s wishes of
his last will and testament.  I’m putting
on the boxing gloves and getting in the ring for the education endowment of
James Brown, Mr Dynamite.  </p>
<p>The crusade is
to raise funds to fight South Carolina to respect James Brown’s will and allow
payments for education, put a few kids through college; under privileged kids until Aiken County
releases funds, have the contester’s “cease and desist,” and return to my first
love of writing and producing music with the Soul Generals and Sons of Funk.</p>

<h4><i>Taking it to the Bridge </i></h4>
<p>Dad being a music innovator enriched me, starting with the challenge of playing the drums and learning the guitar, private education, summer travels working for him, then international and lastly the dream of gracing the stage with my hero, the Godfather of Soul.  James Brown was the hardest working man in the industry of entertainment because he was driven to make sure kids would never be drop outs like him.  Please consider donating so that not only can I continue my father's wishes, but we can legally release his 2000 will and education trust fund ""I Feel Good"" from South Carolina so many other dis-enfranchised students can receive a college education.       </p>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","The Song ""Don't Be A Drop-Out!""  Recorded by James Brown, August 1966 
I am Daryl Brown, the Son of James Brown, gifted musically,
funky by blood and one of only two children named in his will who is a
musician.  I've traveled around the world with my dad twice.  The picture shown here on Indiegogo is me playing the
drums my father sent Christmas 1968.  Dad
also sent a guitar which he challenged me to learn to play so that I could one
day grace the stage with him, and that dream came true.  
My love
for music is so intense that I would skip high school to attend Rutgers College
and study music under the tutelage of Music Professors in Brunswick, NJ.  After mom and dads’ sudden transition(s), an
unsuccessful musical venture, and seven long years of litigation regarding Dad’s
will I lost my musical ambitions.  May
2013 the South Carolina Supreme Court remanded the case back to Aiken County
stating the 2000 will is to be honored, yet nothing has been paid out to send under privileged kids and his grand kids to college.  This catalyst has
sparked a torch in me to pick up and move forward and honor my father’s wishes of
his last will and testament.  I’m putting
on the boxing gloves and getting in the ring for the education endowment of
James Brown, Mr Dynamite.  
The crusade is
to raise funds to fight South Carolina to respect James Brown’s will and allow
payments for education, put a few kids through college; under privileged kids until Aiken County
releases funds, have the contester’s “cease and desist,” and return to my first
love of writing and producing music with the Soul Generals and Sons of Funk.


Maceo, Blow Your Horn


We are asking for $90,000, below explains how we plan to utilize the funds. Our perks are designed to have people ask you questions.  As the campaign gains momentum we will add more perks, who knows what we will come up with ....

""I Feel Good Trust"" KOTSE  Education:        $50,000 = 55.5%
Legal Fund:                                                $25,000 = 27.7%
Admin, Music & Perks:                               $15,000 = 16.6%



Taking it to the Bridge 
Dad being a music innovator enriched me, starting with the challenge of playing the drums and learning the guitar, private education, summer travels working for him, then international and lastly the dream of gracing the stage with my hero, the Godfather of Soul.  James Brown was the hardest working man in the industry of entertainment because he was driven to make sure kids would never be drop outs like him.  Please consider donating so that not only can I continue my father's wishes, but we can legally release his 2000 will and education trust fund ""I Feel Good"" from South Carolina so many other dis-enfranchised students can receive a college education.       



Whatever You Do, Make It Funky
Help us get the world out......... PLEASE, Please, please share this campaign, the more people who know about this crusade will enable us to reach our goal, we realize everyone will not be able to donate, but assisting us to go viral over the net is helping too!
Daryl Brown, Funky By Blood!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Hellon everyone, for those who do not know me, my name is Zoe Hickson. I am a recent graduate of a Naturopathic Medical College. In this program, I received training  to become a practicing physician who practices natural medicine to evoke healing in an individual. The philosophy of natural medicne is based on six principles. However, at the core, it is treating the underlying cause and aiding the body in healing itsself. It is a four year program after you complete your undergraduate degree. I currently have my doctorate degree in naturopathic medicine. So yes I am a doctor. However, to practice in a licensed state, I need to be licensed.<br/><p>I am asking for help to raise money to pay for my medical boards that will take place this August 2013 and my licensure test in October. Registration is this month and ends on May 31st. I learned of this website last night and thought this would be a great opportunity. I am a single mother of a wonderful 3 year old boy. I work part time, and attend a mentorship. I am doing all that I can to raise money so that I can achieve my goals of becoming a Connecticut licensed healer and helping people. I have started my business and have began consulting in other states. However, until I take the clinical boards, I am unable to devote as much time to my practice for it to be lucrative. More recently, I have had to become more creative in taking care of my basics, as I am sure many people have in todays economy. I am a praying woman and will continue to, and work diligently to do my part. I am a woman of faith and know that no matter what, God will provide. I'm not sure what ways God will use, but I know it will happen.</p>
<p><br/>The money will be used for my 3 day test  ($750) in August, my licensure ($565) in October, test materials such as flash cards ($130) and study questions ($90), and some living expenses, as I will not be able to work as much due to studying for 3 months. All donations are welcome and very much appreciated. If I can reach past my goal, that would be awesome, so that I can donate more of my time with health consultations for those in need. I am humbled to ask of your help, and truly honored to receive it. Any extra money will go towards providing  health consultations and supplements to those who cannot afford it, and aid them in their journey towards a healthier life.</p>
<p>I hope that you all can be excited with me when I receive my passing grade. Once I pass, I will take my jurisprudence test for the state of CT and receive my license. Being a doctor has been a goal of mine since I was 5 years old. Ever since that day I have worked towards that goal. ( four years of undergrad, 5 years of medical school- it took me a little longer because I had my son in my third year of medical school). Despite hard times and life throwing many curve balls, I stood steadfast and did not quit or give up. I believe in perseverance and hardwork. I also believe in being humble enough to ask for help.</p>
<p>Below are some websites to give you more information about naturopathic medicine and my test. Everything is legit, and quite informative.  Thank you for your time and contributions. Please feel free to email me as well if need be. I am happy to answer any questions and share more of my story and my goals as a healer.

<p></p></div>","12 HOURS LEFT!!! DO IT NOW!!OUR GOAL:With your help, we want to raise $12,500 in 30 days to buy and donate 30 iPads to the Los Angeles Boy & Girls Club. WHY: We believe everyone should be given the opportunity to play and create music. From our experience since launching the Fingertip Maestro music application in October 2013, this is not always the case. After launching the app we started doing in-person demos at schools and youth organizations around the Los Angeles area, we wanted to show the kids what we created.        $12,500 / 30 Tablets     WHAT IS FINGERTIP MAESTRO?Fingertip Maestro is a revolutionary music-making app for people of all ages and abilities. From children to adults. The app enables those with no musical training, to instantly play convincingly, with the feeling and texture of a real musician. Just Tap, Slide & Play!FREE for iPhone and iPad. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fingertip-maestro/id670049478?ls=1&mt=8 
WHY WE ARE HERE:
We came to the Los Angeles Boys and Girls to get feedback from the kids and see if they liked what we developed. The feedback was amazing and the Kids really helped us make Fingertip Maestro what it is today.       But there is a problem!            The Los Angeles Boys and Girls club           does not have access to digital tablets. Once we finished our demo, we packed up our expensive tablets and headed for the exits. This really made us upset. We knew we needed to do something. That day we decided as a company to purchase an iPad and go back and donate it to the Los Angeles Boys and Girls Club, however, we are just a startup and could only afford to give them one but we knew we could do more. After donating one iPad and seeing the kids faces light up made us realize this is more than just a fun music app. We believe in the merit of our app, and we want to share that with more kids. Moreover, we want to give them the experience of having a technological platform, like an educational tablet at their disposal to learn from.    We are reaching out to you for help!Please help us donate 30 tablets to the Los Angeles Boys and Girls Club      But this is just the start!OUR STRETCH GOALS:There are other organizations and programs we have been working with, and with your help we can surpass our 1st goal of $12,500, and raise an addition $25,000 to purchase and donate 60 more tablets to the organizations below. Let's get 60 more!!!       $37,500 / 60 tablets               20 Tablets /              15 Tablets /                15 Tablets /              10 Tablets /  WHO ARE THESE ORGANIZATIONS?                                                                                    copyright: wongway_films 








LOS ANGELES BOY AND GIRLS CLUB OF AMERICA http://www.labgc.org/ For over 60 years, the Los Angeles Boys & Girls Club has accomplished its goals of opening doors and transforming lives by providing a safe place where young people can be themselves, be proud, and experience opportunities never thought possible.  Through programs that expand horizons, the Club challenges youth to experience the world outside their doorsteps and gives them the tools to succeed.               BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB OF VENICE http://bgcv.publishpath.com/ The Boys & Girls Clubs of Venice’s mission is to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens. The Club was established as a VISTA project on Venice Beach in 1967 and began providing services the following year. Since then we have grown significantly. Today we operate five facilities - our main facility, the James A. Collins Unit, and four satellite sites on the campuses of Coeur d’Alene Elementary School, Short Avenue Elementary School, Mark Twain Middle School, and Venice High School. This year we are expanding our programming to Hamilton High School through a partnership with the JK Living Foundation.                         CITY OF HOPE http://www.cityofhope.org/ City of Hope is dedicated to making a difference in the lives of people with cancer, diabetes and other serious illnesses. Our mission is to transform the future of health care by turning science into a practical benefit, hope into reality. We accomplish this by providing outstanding care, conducting innovative research and offering vital education programs focused on eliminating these diseases.City of Hope continues to be a pioneer of patient centered care and remains committed to its tradition of exceptional care for patients, families and communities. Each day, we live out our credo:""There is no profit in curing the body, if, in the process, we destroy the soul.""                        SCHOOL ON WHEELS - SKIDROW LEARNING CENTER http://www.schoolonwheels.org/ School on Wheels, Inc. is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization founded in 1993 by Agnes Stevens, a retired teacher. After reading Jonathan Kozol’s Rachel and her Children, Agnes realized the extent of homelessness in the USA. She began tutoring homeless kids in a park in Santa Monica, encouraging them to stay in school and participate in school activities.                  TODAY'S FUTURE SOUND http://www.todaysfuturesound.org/ At Today’s Future Sound, we believe in the power of music to transform and inspire youth to create positive change in their lives and communities. We view our work as having educational, therapeutic and social components that can empower individuals to build confidence, inspire creativity, and create change. Today’s Future Sound (TFS) has a team of volunteers ready to bring our mobile music production and DJ’ing center to you—schools, community centers and events. We are rapid-deploying, fully mobile, and can teach all ages groups with no previous experience required. WHAT YOUR DONATION WILL BE USED FOR:
We will use your wonderful donations to purchase and donate tablets for the organizations listed above. We are allotting $400 per tablet to cover tablet, expenses, tax, and accessories, like headphones and covers.EVEN BIGGER STRETCH GOALS?Why not! Lets aim even higher! Sky's the limit. We have even more organizations and kids that can benefit from this campaign so maybe we can push past $37,500 and start another stretch goal.

<h2><strong>The Deal</strong></h2>
<p>Please support me in attending The Social Innovation Program at George Mason Center for Social Entrepreneurship to bring creative, sustainable social solutions to public education and youth services in Western Massachusetts.</p>
<h3><strong>ME</strong></h3>
<p>I am a Masters of Education student at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst studying to become a school counselor and school administrator. The field of education needs leaders who understand how to effectively and creatively use resources, network services, and meet the needs of every student. We need practical yet visionary methods to create lasting and systemic change now. This program will teach me these methods so that I may become such a leader and teach others to be as well.</p>
<h3>
<strong>THE WHY</strong> </h3>
<p>This training would enable me to help the struggling rural communities in my home region. I grew up and have lived most of my life in Western Massachusetts where I have witnessed the cyclical effects of rural poverty such as high drug use, youth homelessness, and sexual abuse generation after generation. Visiting elementary schools, I see the impact in young children including low self-regulation, destructive behaviors, psychological trauma, isolation from the larger world, and little sense of opportunity or personal strength. These children become the older youth I see skipping school to vandalize property who then become the addicted and abusive parents raising their children in the same chaos. We need to infuse national connections and resources into these frequently-isolated areas to more successfully pull youth out of poverty and change the trajectory of these towns’ futures.</p>
<h3>
<strong>THE HOW</strong> </h3>
<p>Working for nonprofits and service organizations, I have also observed how their reach is often stunted by limited funding and lack of business knowledge, particularly during these difficult economic times. Social Entrepreneurship addresses these issues through a collaborative model that combines management and capacity-building with creative and sustainable use of existing resources. Instead of depending on philanthropy and outside funding, social entrepreneurship strengthens organizations and enables them to use available resources in a self-sustaining way in order to provide for themselves. There are plenty of people interested in changing the world, but for meaningful change to occur we must collaborate, apply creative community-based systems, and take advantage of innovations in every arena, particularly business.</p>
<p>The Social Innovation Program at the George Mason Center for Social Entrepreneurship at George Mason University is an intensive, five-week program training participants to be social entrepreneurship consultants to businesses. Students work in small teams to apply their skills in development projects in organizations in the Greater D.C. area and rural Virginia, while simultaneously learning basic social entrepreneurship tenets and topics like effective assessment, resource management, and current innovative techniques. Students are exposed to a network of established nonprofit leaders, organizations, and national scholars in the change-making field. Students leave the program with the experience and training to provide organizational improvement and initiatives in their own communities. More information is available <a href=""http://socialinnovationprogram.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>THE VISION</strong></h3>
<p>I plan to share my experience, new knowledge, and skills with the University of Massachusetts faculty and students as well as with local nonprofits I am connected with such as the <a href=""http://fullframeinitiative.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Full Frame Initiative</a>, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, and requesting organizations. As a representative of my community I can widen the reach of the training to professors, community organizations, and future teachers and leaders, all of whom will in turn influence their own wide audiences.</p>
<p>Further, if administrators and teachers are trained in the social entrepreneurship model, they can pass it on to their students, establishing a new generation of young people who will enter society knowledgeable in conceiving and executing practical, creative, and sustainable solutions for the problems of today and tomorrow. </p>
<h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>You can contribute any dollar amount you want and I will send you rewards for crossing certain thresholds. I will share information I learn with contributors and networking organizations through update letters, stories, outlines, pamphlets, handbooks, and presentation materials. I am also offering in-person trainings and consulting hours in exchange for funding.</p>
<p>The goal of $2100 covers about two thirds of the tuition costs to attend the program. This includes housing, professional training and workshops, speakers, and program materials. </p>
<p>It is possible for contributions toward tuition to be tax-deductible. Please contact me if you are interested. <br/><br/> If I were to exceed the $2100 goal, funds would be applied in the following order: <br/><br/> - $350 to cover the initial SIP deposit and IndieGoGo fees<br/> - $300 for travel expenses to and from the program<br/> - $400 for food during the program (budget recommended by GMCSE)<br/> - Purchasing an up-to-date laptop for the program and upcoming school year<br/> - Professional development fund for School Counseling conferences, education trainings, Brain Gym training, and relevant certification costs. </p>
<p><strong>Note for Local Organizations: </strong>Bringing this training back to my community means you. I would very much like to connect with you, regardless of donation size, on how to best apply these resources in your community to improve reach and strength of services. Sponsorship comes with active networking opportunities with national and D.C. organizations as well as marketing and exposure options. </p>
<p>Thank you for your support and this opportunity for training to be a more effective educator and leader in my community. </p>

Attending the California College Republican convention this spring is another stepping stone in the lives of these 25+ college students. What makes us different from other College Republican Clubs?We are one of the largest, most active chapters in the state. We strive to bring all our active members to the conventions we attend. From the new freshman student who joined the club to make friends, to the senior political science major hoping to gain work experience, this club offers every student at California State University - Channel Islands the opportunity to grow as an individual and realize what they want to do in their lives. Our legacy as a club extends further into the state and even nationally. Former board members have held jobs with California Republican Party and the College Republican National Committee. As a member of the Channel Islands College Republicans, there are endless opportunities for our members.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p></div>","Update: Thank you for your help. The giving can continue on our website!What is The Fieldhouse?
Merging education, athletics, and community development, The Fieldhouse is a space designed to promote the value of scholarship, foster personal growth, and facilitate economic empowerment. Part classroom, part community center, and part athletic complex, it will serve not only as the center for a reintegration-to-education program for child laborers - facilitated by our partner organization, The Cheerful Hearts Foundation - but also as a classroom and sports center shared by six local primary schools in Nyanyano, Ghana. The Fieldhouse is a dedicated means of support for children and families to escape cycles of poverty. The Fieldhouse
programs will foster inclusivity, healthy competition,
recreation, and academic scholarship. In addition to the reintegration program, Cheerful Hearts will host awareness
seminars about education, personal finance workshops,
and public health seminars on disease prevention and reproductive health resources available to the community.


The Impact
At the outset, 120 transitioning child laborers will have a space to seek support and mentorship as they transition back into the school system. 
When schools begin using the facility, over 500 kids will enjoy daily recess at The Fieldhouse. We estimate 200 kids will play in the soccer league. 

A key goal is to make the school system a more compelling alternative to activities that perpetuate a cycle of poverty.
Over time we will measure impact on enrollment rates, completion rates, attendance, and more in order to understand how The Fieldhouse impacts the community with a goal of positive change across all of these metrics. 
What We NeedWith your help, we can raise over $5000 towards the locally-sourced construction materials, the labor of local construction workers, and all of the school and sports supplies essential to making the Fieldhouse the best resource it can be. Other Ways To Give

The construction is estimated to cost between $35,000 - 45,000 USD.
Since January 2014, we have raised nearly $21,000 from our close connections.
Funds raised by this campaign go directly towards constructing and equipping The Fieldhouse to last for decades. 
We are also fundraising through major donors, events, and will seek corporate sponsorships and foundation grants upon approval as 501c3.
The community of Nyanyano is contributing the land and helping build the facilities. This is a major contribution on their part. 
Implementation TimelineFor more information on our origin and progress thus far, click here.7-Year Strategy2013-2014: Implement model in Nyanyano, Ghana2014-2016: Measure results with reports 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after operations at The Fieldhouse begin. We plan to scale the most successful aspects of our work in other locations that are yet to be determined. 2016-2020: The community will be responsible for funding most repairs and may seek funding from FHP for specific items. FHP will raise money through grants and annual fundraising drives as needed.LocationFor more information on why we picked Ghana, click here.DesignFor more information on the design of the building, click here.The Cheerful Hearts FoundationCheerful Hearts is a registered grassroots non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Ghana. Its mission is to provide assistance and support to the rural community development needs in Ghana. CHF works in a wide range of areas such as education, health, and human rights. Its primary focus is to help eliminate child labor and trafficking from all the fishing communities within the Awutu Senya Districts of Ghana.  The Fieldhouse Project has worked with CHF since September, 2013, however, members of our team have worked with CHF for the last three years as volunteers. 


Who will manage it?We have placed great emphasis on making this truly a tool for the community, by the community. Cheerful Hearts program manager Freeman A will be in charge of the program and executive director Eric A O oversee other programs offered at The Fieldhouse. The schedule of use and other rules will be determined by a team of six local educators (one per school), one member from CHF, and one from The Fieldhouse Project.

Go hereTeamwork is fundamental to everything we do, from the authentic relationships we nurture between kids and athlete mentors, to the critical skills learned so that kids can truly support each other to succeed both inside and outside the classroom.  Friendship and trust define the relationship between our students and their Olympian, Paralympian or college athlete mentor. Mentors and kids develop friendships through hundreds of video lessons and multiple live video chats throughout the school year. Athlete mentors also visit schools and participate in wider community events.The results are life changing as kids experience higher classroom engagement, increased confidence in their ability to set and achieve ambitious goals, increased digital literacy, and improved social skills. Study after study shows that the more engaged kids are in class, the more likely they are to persevere in school and pursue productive careers and fulfilling lives.Everyone on our team wins! Students' attendance and grades improve. Teachers are stronger performers, more engaged with their students, and better equipped to take on leadership positions in their schools. Athlete mentors show increased leadership skills. And families and communities are also engaged through teams that extend well beyond the classroom door.Join Team Classroom Champions and be the champion our kids need!

<p><b>We
need your help to give the Wren Avenue 4th and 5th graders the outdoor
educational experience of a life time.</b></p>
<p>For several years now Wren Avenue Elementary
School's Outdoor Education Program at Camp Silver Spur has brought amazing
experiences and opportunities into the lives of our fourth and fifth
graders.  <b>But, we need your
financial support to make it happen. </b></p><p><b>Help
create lifelong memories in the hearts of young children</b>. </p>
<p>Our program offers three nights and four days
of intensive learning about science, math, history, art, music and
dance. Our teachers and staff believe that every child who wishes to
attend camp should be allowed to participate in this opportunity of a lifetime.
We rely heavily on fundraising and donations in order to make this happen.
Although our fundraising efforts have been strong, we have a lot of work ahead
of us.</p>
<b>One
less cup of coffee may be all it takes.</b>
<p>We welcome all donations to this worthy
cause of helping our students go to camp who may not otherwise be able to
attend. A Cappuccino costs around 5 bucks for only one cup. If donating the
cost of a Cappuccino is what you can give, we would be very grateful. That
one donation would be a big help.</p>
<p><b>Could
you give more? Ten, twenty or more dollars? We could use it.</b></p>
<p>If you are able to give more, fantastic!
Every dollar helps. You can also help us by spreading the word on your Facebook
page or on your Twitter feed.</p>
<p><b>What
we need.</b></p>
<p>Our goal of $3,000.00 will help get
our children to Camp Silver Spur. The cost of camp is $225.00 per
student. This fee includes transportation, staff support, meals and lodging. We
are actively raising funds but your support will be a huge help. $3,000 is an ambitious
goal but <b>even though we need approximately
$10,000, every donation will bring us closer to making the Outdoor Education

school does not pay for the trip.</b></p>
<p>Our population of students is diverse and
represents many countries throughout the world. We are proud of our school
community...it is wonderful. They love their children and support their
education. </p>
<p><b>Coming
up with $225.00 (the cost of camp per student) is not easy for many of our
families. </b></p>
<p>Approximately 70% of our students qualify
for free or reduced lunch because they are economically disadvantaged. Most of
our children come from hard-working families whose parents are facing financial
challenges during these tough economic times. <b>You’re your donations will make this year's important Outdoor Education
at Camp Silver Spur happen. </b></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, so many of our students have

happen.</p>
<p><b>Why

<p>Educational experiences outside of the
traditional classroom are just as valuable as the traditional classroom
experiences. They help develop love of nature, and instill an appreciation for

helping our community build productive, independent, well-rounded and positive

<p>The Bahath Centre was founded in June 2011 by two local Tanzanian men, Joseph Lyimo and Emmanuel Tesha.  Both Joseph and Emmanuel experienced difficult hardships as young children growing up in impoverished Tanzanian families, so they decided they wanted to help other children in their community who deal with similar struggles.</p>
<p>We don't see the Bahath Centre as an orphanage.  Instead, we see our Centre as one big family.  Our motto: <b>The Home of Love and a Better Future for the Children</b>.</p>
<p>Innocent (nicknamed Inno), a 10 year old boy, became part of our family a year ago when his guardian refused to provide him important necessities including education, supervision, and love.  As a baby, Inno suffered from an extremely dangerous bout of Malaria, leaving him with neurological seizures and Cerebral Palsy in the right side of his body.  As a result of both his illnesses and the prejudices that many Tanzanians have about people with disabilities, Inno had never attended any kind of education center.  Without an education, Inno is destined to remain dependent on others for survival.  Every day, Inno would watch as his friends and other children in his community left for school in the morning and came home from school in the afternoon.  Inno longed to learn.  He longed to go to school!   </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As part of our family, we worked hard to find a school that could provide Inno with the right support he needed in order to learn.  Gabriella Rehabilitation Center, located half an hour away from the orphanage, is a private boarding school which caters to children with mental and physical disabilities.  They use Western based teaching techniques and styles with educated teachers from around the world volunteering their time for these children.  At Gabriella, Inno and his school mates learn more than academia - they learn how to survive.  Gabriella Rehabilitation Center works with each student to strengthen his or her physical and mental abilities, helping to ensure that each child has a future and is able to play a functioning role in Tanzanian society.      </span></p>
<p>Inno has been attending Gabriella since last October and has been happily and healthily striving!!!  </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<div>Private schools in Tanzania are extremely expensive and usually out of reach for the average Tanzanian family who typically lives off of less than $2 a day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>                             1 year</b> at Gabriella, including boarding, costs <b>$900</b>.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This holiday season, we are looking to raise <b>$2500</b> in <b>25 days</b> in order to guarantee Innocent another 2 years of schooling at Gabriella as well as guarantee coverage of his medical and hospital bills.</div> <p>             <b>Please help us give Innocent the gift of a proper education and future!</b></p>

The Bahath Centre was founded in June 2011 by two local Tanzanian men, Joseph Lyimo and Emmanuel Tesha.  Both Joseph and Emmanuel experienced difficult hardships as young children growing up in impoverished Tanzanian families, so they decided they wanted to help other children in their community who deal with similar struggles.
We don't see the Bahath Centre as an orphanage.  Instead, we see our Centre as one big family.  Our motto: The Home of Love and a Better Future for the Children.
Innocent (nicknamed Inno), a 10 year old boy, became part of our family a year ago when his guardian refused to provide him important necessities including education, supervision, and love.  As a baby, Inno suffered from an extremely dangerous bout of Malaria, leaving him with neurological seizures and Cerebral Palsy in the right side of his body.  As a result of both his illnesses and the prejudices that many Tanzanians have about people with disabilities, Inno had never attended any kind of education center.  Without an education, Inno is destined to remain dependent on others for survival.  Every day, Inno would watch as his friends and other children in his community left for school in the morning and came home from school in the afternoon.  Inno longed to learn.  He longed to go to school!   
As part of our family, we worked hard to find a school that could provide Inno with the right support he needed in order to learn.  Gabriella Rehabilitation Center, located half an hour away from the orphanage, is a private boarding school which caters to children with mental and physical disabilities.  They use Western based teaching techniques and styles with educated teachers from around the world volunteering their time for these children.  At Gabriella, Inno and his school mates learn more than academia - they learn how to survive.  Gabriella Rehabilitation Center works with each student to strengthen his or her physical and mental abilities, helping to ensure that each child has a future and is able to play a functioning role in Tanzanian society.      
Inno has been attending Gabriella since last October and has been happily and healthily striving!!!     
What We Need 
Private schools in Tanzania are extremely expensive and usually out of reach for the average Tanzanian family who typically lives off of less than $2 a day.


                             1 year at Gabriella, including boarding, costs $900.

This holiday season, we are looking to raise $2500 in 25 days in order to guarantee Innocent another 2 years of schooling at Gabriella as well as guarantee coverage of his medical and hospital bills.              Please help us give Innocent the gift of a proper education and future!

<p>My name is Sarah Marie McCabe and even in the first grade, I
knew I wanted to be a teacher. Maybe it was the butterflies busting out of
their cocoons in the classroom corner, or maybe it was Ms. Vensuela’s warm and upbeat
enthusiasm for learning. Whatever it was, I was inspired enough to stick with
this early and intuitive decision. Upon graduating from San Francisco State
University in May 2013 with a Bachelor’s degree in Liberal Studies and American
Literature, I planned on taking my passions of teaching English, digital/analog
photography, and yoga abroad. And this is this chance! </p>
<p>My campaign will directly help fund the costs of travel from
California to Thailand, Greenheart program fees, 4 weeks of TESOL certification
courses, work visa fees, hostel fare for night of Bangkok arrival, and solidify
a small emergency fund. As a contributor to this campaign you will fuel the
fire for a yearlong experience as an English educator to elementary aged
children in the southern community of Hua Hin, Thailand. This coastal community
has a high volume of tourists and as English is becoming a prominent worldwide
language, the demand for English teachers is increasing. With six years of in
class and after school educational experience, I know that this international
teaching opportunity is the next big step for me for to full-heartedly take.</p>
<p>Even if my entire goal is not achieved, know that your
donated funds will still directly contribute to some of the costs mentioned
earlier. I’m just open arms to whatever my friends, family, or awesome online
supporters are willing to contribute. Whether it is $1 or $100, your
contribution is truly funding a dream!</p>
<p>If you know of any other educators, travel enthusiasts,

As of July 2014, WWSC  has connected to over 3200 women globally. One of the amazing women who I met is Zephaniah. Zephaniah is an educator and women's rights advocate from Gujranwala District in Pakistan. Zephaniah operates Zephaniah Free Education a school for girls and young women who cannot afford an education.  In Pakistan, as Zephaniah says, ""There is a danger and one thing that can ruin our world and that is illiteracy. Girls and women are not empowered and there is only one solution to all our problems, and that is education and awareness of women’s rights. I want every girl to be educated, empowered and protected.” As of 2014, Zephaniah has helped teach and empower 500 girls. She has a  ‘Women's Learning Center’ where students are taught sewing, stitching and embroidery, and a beauty salon area where young women learn hair dressing, make-up artistry and other skills. Zephaniah has an education program with up to 100 students, as well as an English language course. Zephaniah does all this for free for the poor of her local community. In July, 2014 Worldwide Women's Support Circle put out an appeal for funds to raise money to get a Computer Center up and running for Zephaniah Free Education. With one generous donor, we were able to complete Phase One of the Computer Center.  Zephaniah had enough money to have electricity installed, and lights and a ceiling fan put up, tables were made that have space for the three computers as well as room for the three laptops we want to provide as part of phase II for the Computer. (Photo below)                                  With the three computers Zephaniah Free Education was recently gifted, she will teach 9 students at a time. The computer program training will take three months to complete. In one year there will be 108 girls who will benefit from the computer program. With the three additional laptop computers the numbers of students will double to 216 in a year!WHAT WE NEED TO COMPLETE COMPUTER CENTER3 laptop computers, $300 each                              Total $900

So the school fencing is needed to protect the garden from wildlife destruction.IrrigationCurrently, the water tank that is required to supply water to the school is not functioning; we plan on renovating the system currently implemented in order to allow a continuous supply of water to the school and garden. CultivationThe Tingatinga Primary School garden will raise food crops that can be sold, with the profits used to help provide nutritious, balanced meals for all the children in the school. How will we determine project success?As the project aims at improving the nutritional status, school attendance and successful education outcomes of children in the proposed area two measures that will be used to determine project success:

School attendance records and students performance - Assessing the changes in school attendance, - truancy level and - school performance after initiation of the feeding project will serve as a success indicator.
Nutritional status assessment
- Recording and comparing children’s weight, length for height and mid upper arm  circumference before the initiation of feeding project and six months after running a  successful feeding project.       Nai, 11, gives us a tiny smile. She has just returned back to class after recess. 

An empty classroom at Tingatinga Primary School. What will we do with your donation?Education Village's primary goal is to improve school conditions in villages across Tanzania. The School Gardening Project is the first hurdle in a long race to better the school enviroment in these regions. With continued support and donations we aim to;1. Establish the school feeding project in other villages around Tanzania.2. Provide school materials i.e. notebooks, reading materials, backpacks and uniforms.3. Create a teacher development programs at these schools to improve content of education.4. Begin providing medical check ups for the students, to alleviate any illness that may be hindering   their education.5. Improve infrastructure i.e. classrooms, the kitchen and teacher housing on school grounds. what do they want to be when they grow up?Thank you for visiting our page!Visit our website and facebook page for more information.

<h3>Sickle cell Natural Wellness Group Inc.</h3>
<p>Sickle cell affects over 200,000 in America and millions world-wide.<br/></p>
<p>T.J. Brown is a sickle cell survivor, as a child he was told he wouldn't live to see 14. He is 23 years old now. Most people with his illness have a lifetime of pain and suffering. Death is a word often connected to sickle cell anemia. After having several close calls with death, T.J, chose to stand up and make a difference in his life. At one point he was bed ridden and weak, if T.J. wasn't in the hospital he would be sick at home. Through the knowledge of a natural holistic lifestyle he was able to over come something that was once thought of as impossible. After T.J.'s success with his own health he has decided to share the good news and help people all over the world. There are many who are experiencing the benefits of natural/healthy living.<br/></p>

People who have adapted to this organic lifestyle have reported that they make less or have no more visits to the hospital. Also having less pain episodes, and experienced an overall positive renewal in both their emotional and physical state. <br/><br/><br style=""font-weight: bold;""/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">How can someone find you?</span> <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>

Sickle cell affects over 200,000 in America and millions world-wide.
T.J. Brown is a sickle cell survivor, as a child he was told he wouldn't live to see 14. He is 23 years old now. Most people with his illness have a lifetime of pain and suffering. Death is a word often connected to sickle cell anemia. After having several close calls with death, T.J, chose to stand up and make a difference in his life. At one point he was bed ridden and weak, if T.J. wasn't in the hospital he would be sick at home. Through the knowledge of a natural holistic lifestyle he was able to over come something that was once thought of as impossible. After T.J.'s success with his own health he has decided to share the good news and help people all over the world. There are many who are experiencing the benefits of natural/healthy living.


The Impact
What are some activities that your organizations do in the community?We host raw food prep classes, informational health events, and nutritional presentations at various locations. We also attend support groups and educate hospital patients. We work with clients on a one-on-one basis, and we do home visits. ☺ How has your organization made a difference in peoples lives so far?I personally know people with SCD who were afraid of discussing the disease, they have become more vocal and are working to advance sickle cell awareness.  Many people who have had no knowledge of sickle cell became aware of it and some are even currently involved in programs that aid sickle cell patients. People who have adapted to this organic lifestyle have reported that they make less or have no more visits to the hospital. Also having less pain episodes, and experienced an overall positive renewal in both their emotional and physical state. How can someone find you?

What we don't have at the moment is the actual materials.  That's where you come in.  Each and every contribution, no matter how small,  helps getting us one step closer to the dream.</p><p>The expected opening of the Gardens is scheduled for March 2, 2015.  If you sponsor any plantings or trees or fountains, you will be invited to the opening so that you can come look and take
photos with your gift, marked with your name sake.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><h3>
<strong><em>“Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.”</em> – Vincent Van Gogh</strong>:</h3><p>The Gardens have been broken down into a series of smaller phases. </p><p></p><ol>
<li>
<b>STEPPING STONES:  </b>The path of the stepping stones will lead to, through, and around the obstacles of the maze, eventually coming to the focal point, the water fountain. Although not the actual stones, these represent only a few of the several thousand we will need.  <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/502890/files/20140412075611-Cut-Flagstone-Stepping-Stone-Path-Through-Garden-and-Arbor.jpg?1397314571"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</li>
<li>
<b>MONKEY GRASS; </b>The outline or borders of the Maze wil be defined by flower beds specifically placed as to define the pathways.  Along these flower beds, the borders will be lined with Monkey grass, lots and lots of it.  Over time this clumps of Monkey grass will grow together creating a unified line, but the initial planting will take hundreds if not thousands of clumps. </li>
<li>
<b>FRUIT TREES:</b> Throughout the botanical gardens, trees will be placed strategically in rows, dotted along walkways, and placed in specific beds, but no tree can be as interesting and functional as a fruit tree.  There will be a multitude of variety to plant; Apple, Orange, Lemon, Peach, etc.  With each sponsorship of a tree, you will receive a plaque next to the tree, giving the date it was planted and the name of the sponsor.  </li>
<li>
<b>CREPE MYRTLES:</b> A beautiful and delicate tree indeed.  Light and airy with pastel blossoms, this tree will be a great assest to any Garden.  With the sponsorship of this tree, a plaque will be placed next to the tree with the name of your choosing. This photo represents only one of the many colors that will be planted in the Gardens.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/502897/files/20140412075834-images.jpg?1397314714"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</li>
<li>
<b>LIVE OAKS:  </b>These are the most majestic of all trees, with its strength and stature, these trees will be around for generations to come.  These particular trees will be the staple of our botanical Gardens.  They are quite expensive at $100.00 a piece, but will be well worth the price considering the beauty, shade, and emphasis to the Garden</li>
<li>
<b>WEEPING WILLOW:</b> Often associated with mourning and grief, this could not be furthest from the truth.  The weeping willow is determined to find water with its strong roots, and its ability to adapt to environment changes with is bending branches.  Put your name on this tree and have it ever immortalized for generations to come.  <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/502913/files/20140412080329-weeping-willow.jpg?1397315009"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</li>
<li>
<b>VEGETABLE GARDEN: </b> A bed all by its self.  This vegetable garden inside the botanical gardens will give visitors of all ages an opportunity to work, produce, and yield a crop of our own local vegetables.  With this sponsorship an entire bed and one segment of the maze will be dedicated to nothing but the vegetables.  A plaque with your name will be grounded into the Head of The Vegetable Garden itself.  </li>
<li>
<b>ROSE GARDEN: </b>Ever wanted your very own rose garden without all the work.  Now you can.  Sponsor this Garden and you can name it.  Want to immortalize your mother for generations, nothing says, ""I love you"" like a Rose Garden bearing her name.</li>
<li>
<b>WATER FOUNTAIN;</b> The focal point of the Garden.  In the center of the maze will be the pride and joy of it all, the water fountain.  This water fountain is a 4 tiered, 8 foot in diameter, 12 feet tall, free flowing fountain.  Its beautiful, tranquil, and above all else will carry your name or that of your loved one. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/502936/files/20140412081922-321697_2078535455160_2056391109_o.jpg?1397315962"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

What we don't have at the moment is the actual materials.  That's where you come in.  Each and every contribution, no matter how small,  helps getting us one step closer to the dream.The expected opening of the Gardens is scheduled for March 2, 2015.  If you sponsor any plantings or trees or fountains, you will be invited to the opening so that you can come look and take
photos with your gift, marked with your name sake.What We Need & What You Get
“Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.” – Vincent Van Gogh:The Gardens have been broken down into a series of smaller phases. 

STEPPING STONES:  The path of the stepping stones will lead to, through, and around the obstacles of the maze, eventually coming to the focal point, the water fountain. Although not the actual stones, these represent only a few of the several thousand we will need.  


MONKEY GRASS; The outline or borders of the Maze wil be defined by flower beds specifically placed as to define the pathways.  Along these flower beds, the borders will be lined with Monkey grass, lots and lots of it.  Over time this clumps of Monkey grass will grow together creating a unified line, but the initial planting will take hundreds if not thousands of clumps. 

FRUIT TREES: Throughout the botanical gardens, trees will be placed strategically in rows, dotted along walkways, and placed in specific beds, but no tree can be as interesting and functional as a fruit tree.  There will be a multitude of variety to plant; Apple, Orange, Lemon, Peach, etc.  With each sponsorship of a tree, you will receive a plaque next to the tree, giving the date it was planted and the name of the sponsor.  

CREPE MYRTLES: A beautiful and delicate tree indeed.  Light and airy with pastel blossoms, this tree will be a great assest to any Garden.  With the sponsorship of this tree, a plaque will be placed next to the tree with the name of your choosing. This photo represents only one of the many colors that will be planted in the Gardens.


LIVE OAKS:  These are the most majestic of all trees, with its strength and stature, these trees will be around for generations to come.  These particular trees will be the staple of our botanical Gardens.  They are quite expensive at $100.00 a piece, but will be well worth the price considering the beauty, shade, and emphasis to the Garden

WEEPING WILLOW: Often associated with mourning and grief, this could not be furthest from the truth.  The weeping willow is determined to find water with its strong roots, and its ability to adapt to environment changes with is bending branches.  Put your name on this tree and have it ever immortalized for generations to come.  


VEGETABLE GARDEN:  A bed all by its self.  This vegetable garden inside the botanical gardens will give visitors of all ages an opportunity to work, produce, and yield a crop of our own local vegetables.  With this sponsorship an entire bed and one segment of the maze will be dedicated to nothing but the vegetables.  A plaque with your name will be grounded into the Head of The Vegetable Garden itself.  

ROSE GARDEN: Ever wanted your very own rose garden without all the work.  Now you can.  Sponsor this Garden and you can name it.  Want to immortalize your mother for generations, nothing says, ""I love you"" like a Rose Garden bearing her name.

WATER FOUNTAIN; The focal point of the Garden.  In the center of the maze will be the pride and joy of it all, the water fountain.  This water fountain is a 4 tiered, 8 foot in diameter, 12 feet tall, free flowing fountain.  Its beautiful, tranquil, and above all else will carry your name or that of your loved one. 


NAMING OF THE BOTANICAL GARDENS: Always dream of leaving your legacy behind, well now you can.  For the sum of $20,000 you can name the Botanical Gardens after yourself, your loved ones, or your company sponsorship.  Have thousands of people every day, all day, associate your name with that of a beautiful botanical garden.  A grand arbor with an entrance to rival that of royalty will be constructed upon entry into the Gardens, with your name above the Gardens, all promotional venues and Garden advertisements and anything associated with the promotion of the Gardens will bear your name.  Wanna name it for your loved ones, The Mona T.

The ImpactIts no secret that botanical gardens are beautiful, but they are also educational and therapeutic.  Many students from neighboring communities were dumbfounded to learn that vegetables actually grow from the ground and fruit were born of trees.  Grocery stores have become a staple of cities and towns to the point children are no longer aware where their food comes.  A simple stroll through the Gardens?! Anything but,.  Not only providing exercise but fresh air, and the tranquility to clear ones thoughts.  Help make the dream a reality by sponsoring one of our smaller phases, leading to the overall picture. Other Ways You Can HelpCan't contribute financially?  No worries, just please continue to keeps us in your thoughts and prayers.  Our expected opening date is March 2, 2014.  Come out, visit, and relax in the beautiful Gardens.  If you sponsored a planting, look for your tree and plaque among the Gardens.  Please continue to invite your friend to like and share this page and information.  Thanks so much!!!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign
