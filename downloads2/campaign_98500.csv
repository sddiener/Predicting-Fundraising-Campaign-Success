<h3>SUV2RV Tent - Turn Your SUV Into an RV</h3>
<p>Have you ever wanted to enjoy camping with an RV but didn't want to tow one, drive one, rent one, or BUY one? I know I did. So that's why I've spent nearly the last 2 years developing the SUV2RV Instatent.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618121651/vmy4ruaysnve23hphwlt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Granville SUV2RV Instatent transforms your SUV, Crossover, or minivan into a luxurious camping abode that lets you enjoy all the benefits of a tent while enjoying the comforts of your vehicle.  Run power from your car to your tent easily, access items stored in your vehicle conveniently, and most of all, the living space in the tent expands into the comfort of your SUV.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618121693/dsbxivjzc2jgssmqz538.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The SUV2RV will fit ANY hatchback vehicle. That means <strong>it fits all SUVs</strong> like Kia Sorentos and  Ford Explorers, <strong>it fits all crossovers</strong> like Honda CRVs and Subaru Foresters and <strong>it fits all minivans</strong> like Dodge Caravans or Honda Odysseys. If it has a hatch back, the SUV2RV fits!</p>
<h3>Exclusive Instatent™ Technology - Sets up in Seconds</h3>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://offroading.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/setting-up-animated-gift.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With our exclusive Integrated Instatent technology, your tent sets up in seconds (literally).</p>
<p><strong>Installation is three easy steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Lay the tent flat and raise the tent by simply extending the 4 pre-assembled poles.</li>
<li>Pull the water-proof seal from the tent over your vehicle hatchback.</li>
<li>Tighten the straps from the top of the tent over your roof or your vehicle (to either roof bars or your hood) and behind your wheel wheels.</li>
</ol> <p>The entire tent comes pre-assembled in one piece. That means no finding out which poles go where. No assembling poles and no deciphering instructions. This is all thanks to the integrated fully-automatic cam located at the top of the tent.</p>

<h3>The Next Best Thing to Class A Motorhome</h3>
<p>The SUV2RV forms a waterproof seal between the the tent and your vehicle, allowing you to turn your hatchback vehicle into the next best thing after a Class A landyacht.

<p>Camping in the SUV2RV is far more enjoyable than camping in a traditional tent for countless reasons including:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more running back and forth between your vehicle to fetch gear</li>
<li>True two bedroom living space</li>
<li>Easily run power from your vehicle to your tent</li>

<p>Our team started development in 2019. Our goal was to make not only a practical vehicle tent but also one that assembled super easily.</p>
<p>After receiving our first prototypes of of the SUV2RV tent it was just too hard to install onto a vehicle. There's nothing I hate more than trying to figure out how to setup a tent at the campsite! So we went back to the drawing board to figure out how to develop a tent that can be setup quicker than it takes to burn a marshmallow over a campfire. The result was exclusive instant pop-up technology that lets the entire SUV2RV tent be setup in 2 minutes or less.</p>
<p>Our team is based in British Columbia - one of the rainiest places on Earth. Subsequently, we've built a tent that can withstand any weather you throw at it - from beating sun to pouring rain.</p>

<h2>WHO WE ARE </h2>
<p>Longtime friends and bicycle aficionados, Alex and Konstantinos, set out in 2020 to tackle the number one safety-concern of cyclists on the streets once and for all: make car drivers aware of you and your intentions on the street.<br/> <br/>From off-road biking in the Swiss Alps to the daily commute through Zurich City, the importance of proper safety equipment always stood out to us. This knowledge helped us in producing the next generation bicycle helmet.<br/> <br/>We co-founded Litgard GmbH to bring you a helmet which offers you excellent protection but also remains affordable, without compromising comfort. A helmet that is not just smart, but also discreet and elegant. And we believe that we made it.<br/> <br/>Say hello to LITGARD, where safety meets comfort and style.</p>

</div><div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>DESIGNED FOR SAFETY<br/>MADE FOR LIFE </h2>
<p>When we first envisioned and sketched out the LITGARD helmet, our primary objective was to bring safety in both your day and night-time biking.</p>
<p>Our first sample focused on integrating the lights in a way that will ensure that you are visible on the street from all angles. In doing so, we quickly stumbled upon the problem of other smart helmets: how to not compromise in terms of looks and comfort.</p>
<p>After multiple iterations of scrutinising and testing samples, we stopped only when we were certain that the design and comfort mix was absolutely perfect.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619117346/qq8pnbwdxlfadqtqhgfg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>LITGARD is aerodynamically designed to ensure a cool airflow. Multiple vents, with inner air channels draw the cool air towards the helmet and over the brow, allowing it to pass-through quickly and leave behind you with ease as it warms up.</p>
<p>LITGARD’s ergonomic design allows it to rest comfortably on your head, thanks to its ultralight weight. The rear fitting-system and straps with quick-release functionality offer stability, allowing your head to be lightly and safely embraced.</p>
<p>On-off and remote control buttons were designed so that you can locate them with a simple, intuitive move of your hand.</p>
<p>Elegant and uncomplicated, the LITGARD helmet was designed with you in mind.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>PRODUCTION</h2>
<p>We work in collaboration with manufacturers with a long experience and know-how in the production of bicycle helmets. Here a sneak peek from inside the facilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/feGtKZCKDIE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>The first batch of LITGARD helmets is already in production. We will be updating you on the progress throughout the campaign. Stay tuned!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>MODES</h2>
<div>
<p>LITGARD comes with 3 embedded modes to best serve your biking needs under changing circumstances on the road. </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Mode 1:</strong> Just as a simple tail-light, hopefully however, not as frequently stolen or forgotten at home. Best suited for conditions with high visibility. Offers the lowest battery consumption among modes (run time: 14.5hrs).</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Mode 2:</strong> White light at 70% allows you to be visible at night from all angles but in a discreet manner and with an economic battery consumption profile (run time: 7.0hrs). </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Mode 3:</strong> White light at 100% brightness not only makes you visible from all angles but also illuminates the area around you. Ideal in conditions with very low visibility. Highest battery consumption (run time: 4.0hrs).</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621108664/nwiguvopbkfrxnjtbjqi.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note that the <strong>turn and brake-warning signal buttons work in all three modes.</strong> Once signalling has stopped, the helmet will return to the mode you had selected.</p>
<h3>

</h3>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>SWITCHING BETWEEN MODES - ON/OFF </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">To switch between<br/>modes, just short-press<br/>the button, located at<br/>the rear of the helmet.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">To turn LITGARD on or<br/>off, simply press and<br/>hold the rear button<br/>for 0.5 seconds.</p> <p>The button is ergonomically designed, so that you can locate it with a simple, intuitive move of your hand.</p>
<p>For your safety however, we recommend to always take a brief stop at the side of the road, when changing between modes.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>SELECTING THE RIGHT SIZE</h2>
<p>The LITGARD Smart Helmet is available in two sizes; S/M and M/L and they are both equipped with a fitting system to ensure optimal fit and comfort. </p>
<p>The size only depends on the circumference of your head:  </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>S/M for head circumference of 54 - 58 cm (21.2 - 22.8 in).</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>M/L for head circumference of 58 - 62 cm (22.8 - 24.4 in). </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You can measure the circumference of your head by placing a tape measure about 1cm / 0.39in above your eyebrows.</p>
<p>If you measured your head's circumference at exactly 58cm/22.8in, we suggest that you order the M/L size to be certain that the helmet fits you.​</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
<p>We don't want to tire you with endless scrolling going over technical details. That's why we gathered all the specs here. </p>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621090219/nbbfz8bjwrkqb4ttqjv7.png"" src=""""/></h2>
<h2> </h2>

</div></div>","WHO WE ARE 
Longtime friends and bicycle aficionados, Alex and Konstantinos, set out in 2020 to tackle the number one safety-concern of cyclists on the streets once and for all: make car drivers aware of you and your intentions on the street. From off-road biking in the Swiss Alps to the daily commute through Zurich City, the importance of proper safety equipment always stood out to us. This knowledge helped us in producing the next generation bicycle helmet. We co-founded Litgard GmbH to bring you a helmet which offers you excellent protection but also remains affordable, without compromising comfort. A helmet that is not just smart, but also discreet and elegant. And we believe that we made it. Say hello to LITGARD, where safety meets comfort and style.

FEATURE SUMMARY
 


 
DESIGNED FOR SAFETYMADE FOR LIFE 
When we first envisioned and sketched out the LITGARD helmet, our primary objective was to bring safety in both your day and night-time biking.
Our first sample focused on integrating the lights in a way that will ensure that you are visible on the street from all angles. In doing so, we quickly stumbled upon the problem of other smart helmets: how to not compromise in terms of looks and comfort.
After multiple iterations of scrutinising and testing samples, we stopped only when we were certain that the design and comfort mix was absolutely perfect.

LITGARD is aerodynamically designed to ensure a cool airflow. Multiple vents, with inner air channels draw the cool air towards the helmet and over the brow, allowing it to pass-through quickly and leave behind you with ease as it warms up.
LITGARD’s ergonomic design allows it to rest comfortably on your head, thanks to its ultralight weight. The rear fitting-system and straps with quick-release functionality offer stability, allowing your head to be lightly and safely embraced.
On-off and remote control buttons were designed so that you can locate them with a simple, intuitive move of your hand.
Elegant and uncomplicated, the LITGARD helmet was designed with you in mind.
 
PRODUCTION
We work in collaboration with manufacturers with a long experience and know-how in the production of bicycle helmets. Here a sneak peek from inside the facilities.
 


 

The first batch of LITGARD helmets is already in production. We will be updating you on the progress throughout the campaign. Stay tuned!
 
MODES

LITGARD comes with 3 embedded modes to best serve your biking needs under changing circumstances on the road. 

Mode 1: Just as a simple tail-light, hopefully however, not as frequently stolen or forgotten at home. Best suited for conditions with high visibility. Offers the lowest battery consumption among modes (run time: 14.5hrs).
 

Mode 2: White light at 70% allows you to be visible at night from all angles but in a discreet manner and with an economic battery consumption profile (run time: 7.0hrs). 
 

Mode 3: White light at 100% brightness not only makes you visible from all angles but also illuminates the area around you. Ideal in conditions with very low visibility. Highest battery consumption (run time: 4.0hrs).
 

 
Note that the turn and brake-warning signal buttons work in all three modes. Once signalling has stopped, the helmet will return to the mode you had selected.



SWITCHING BETWEEN MODES - ON/OFF 
To switch betweenmodes, just short-pressthe button, located atthe rear of the helmet.
To turn LITGARD on oroff, simply press andhold the rear buttonfor 0.5 seconds. The button is ergonomically designed, so that you can locate it with a simple, intuitive move of your hand.
For your safety however, we recommend to always take a brief stop at the side of the road, when changing between modes.
 
SELECTING THE RIGHT SIZE
The LITGARD Smart Helmet is available in two sizes; S/M and M/L and they are both equipped with a fitting system to ensure optimal fit and comfort. 
The size only depends on the circumference of your head:  
 
S/M for head circumference of 54 - 58 cm (21.2 - 22.8 in).
 
M/L for head circumference of 58 - 62 cm (22.8 - 24.4 in). 
 
You can measure the circumference of your head by placing a tape measure about 1cm / 0.39in above your eyebrows.
If you measured your head's circumference at exactly 58cm/22.8in, we suggest that you order the M/L size to be certain that the helmet fits you.​
 
SPECIFICATIONS
We don't want to tire you with endless scrolling going over technical details. That's why we gathered all the specs here. 

 
WHATS IN THE BOX?
The LITGARD helmet comes with a USB charging cable, the LITGARD wireless remote control, a remote control mounting strap and a user manual.

Shawnee Bluffs Canopy Tour, a world class zipline adventure, stretches above 83 beautiful acres in Southern Illinois.  Owner, Marc Miles, commissioned the International Mountain Bike Association (IMBA) to design a professional and purpose-built mountain bike park on this pristine property!  Shawnee Bluffs Mountain Bike Park will crisscross below the course of Shawnee Bluffs Canopy Tour.

FAQ
Q. When will the Shawnee Bluffs Mountain Bike Park be built?
With $95,000, we will begin Phase 1, which we plan to have completed by August! If the full amount is raised, Phases 2 and 3 will be completed by next spring.
Q. I see all this support for veterans, can you give more detail?
Of course!  Our vision is to offer All-Terrain Action Track Chair tours at no charge to veterans and first responders who use wheelchairs.  We also will offer a discount to all military personnel.
Q. I see that there is an option to be on a contributor board or a Veteran Memorial Wall, how do I choose?
After the campaign is completed, we will email you to choose which one you would prefer, along with the additional information we need for the board!




Marc Miles, owner of Shawnee Bluffs Canopy tour, was born in Kansas and raised on a horse and cattle ranch there. After high school graduation, he attended Kansas State University, where he received his D.V.M. degree in 1978, and entered the practice of equine veterinary medicine, working in St. Louis, Missouri, and Riverside, California, before coming to Southern Illinois in 1993. He has been the owner and sole practitioner of Southern Illinois Equine Clinic in Energy, Illinois, since that time.
Marc Miles opened Shawnee Bluffs Canopy Tour almost 2 years ago as Illinois’ first entirely tree-based, eco-friendly zipline canopy tour, located on 83 wooded acres surrounded by the Shawnee National Forest.  Shawnee Bluffs Canopy Tour consists of 8 ziplines, the longest stretching 1,016 feet, which zig-zag across the property’s bluffs and through the valley.



When Saluki Collegiate Entrepreneur Organization (CEO), within the College of Business at Southern Illinois University, was given the opportunity to manage, produce, and promote a crowdfunding campaign for Marc Miles, we couldn't say no. As students and entrepreneurs, we are always seeking to gain insight into potential educational learning opportunities that will enhance our future ventures.  Our team has been given the opportunity to learn valuable marketing principles, video development, and content creation.  We can't wait to see you out on the trails!

We launched our first project on Kickstarter in 2014, and with the help of crowdfunding developed the patented 12oz Stojo Pocket Cup. It’s the world’s only ultra-portable, collapsible, leak-proof coffee cup. We learned a lot about making collapsible coffee cups along the way, and received invaluable feedback from our early backers and customers. Two of the most common requests were: “I need a bigger cup!” and “What about a straw?”
Well we listened and now we’re back in a ""Biggie"" way! Same awesome design and functionality as the Stojo Pocket Cup, but with 33% more thirst-quenching capacity and a collapsible straw, so you can enjoy your coffee, tea or other beverages hot or on ice.



For now, all you have to do is pick the number of cups you want. At the end of the campaign, you will be given the opportunity to pick what color cups you want.

 The design is complete, the prototypes work as expected, but the tooling is expensive. We need to raise $40k in order to build the tools that will mass produce the Stojo Biggie. By backing us today, you not only get first dibs on this year's coolest coffee gadget (and mad props at the local cafe), but you get the satisfaction of knowing that you (and we do mean YOU) actually helped bring a product to life that will prevent millions of disposable cups from polluting our environment.

As three coffee-loving dads with a passion for the environment, we hated to admit that our combined habit alone was responsible for over 1,000 of the 58 million disposable cups being added to landfills every year. Lugging around a bulky travel mug just didn't fit into our urban lifestyle and after searching the market we found nothing that solved our need for portability.
Fast forward two years and we have manufactured and sold almost 200,000 Stojo Pocket Cups to people all over the world, drastically reducing the amount of disposable coffee cups that get used and tossed into our landfills.






Want to give your company some serious eco street cred? A company can never have enough eco mojo! Buy the 16 oz Stojo Biggie or the 12 oz Stojo Pocket Cup. During the campaign (order must be placed by July 14th), Stojo is offering an extra 15% off our regular wholesale pricing on order of 96 cups or more.

Jacob, our amazing summer intern, and Patrick, his best friend since kindergarten, agreed to help us beta test the Giving Back business model by introducing their own limited edition Stojo Biggie. We're dubbing it the ""All American"".
Also...blue is Patrick's favorite color and red is Jacob's.  Plus, the cup looks like the Stojo Biggie Captain America would have designed if he was our summer intern instead of Jacob.


Patrick & Jacob's story
The boys started competing in long-distance races together in high school after being inspired by a father-son team who ran the Boston Marathon. Patrick lives with Cerebral Palsy and competing in these runs challenges both boys and gives them a fun way to bond.
They will be running a half-marathon on June 11. In honor of their undertaking, they thought it would be cool to raise some money for a good cause. Read more about Patrick and Jacob here.


Patrick Dewey, Jacob Russell & Dave Russell Rockin' Ugly Christmas Sweaters!
How will Stojo use my money?
$10 from the sale of each $25 cup will be donated to the Double H Ranch, a wonderful organization that provides specialized programs and year-round support for children and their families dealing with life-threatening illnesses. Patrick used to attend their programs as a boy and giving back would mean a lot to him.

If you have a cause that is close to your heart and want to consider creating a special edition Stojo Biggie to raise money, please reach out to us at help@stojo.co. We’ll work hard, make it fun, and help you raise money in a unique, environmentally friendly way!

A: Once collapsed the heat sleeve fits easily on the bottom of the cup.
Q: Can the Stojo Biggie go in the microwave?
A: Yes, the Stojo Biggie is dishwasher & microwave safe. The Stojo Biggie is best cleaned disassembled on the top rack of the dishwasher. The lid to the Stojo Biggie should be removed before placing the cup in the microwave to avoid steam buildup and potential scalding.
Q: What are the colors offered?

A: The Stojo Biggie holds 16 fluid ounces, weighs 6 ounces, is 5.5"" tall when expanded and 2"" tall when collapsed into a disk. It has a 4"" diameter and fits comfortably in most hands and cup holders.

Q: How much force does it take to collapse the Stojo Biggie?
A: The following is a sticky analogy, but it takes about as much strength as it does to crush an egg on a table (if the egg is standing tall/vertically).
Q: Can I put a Stojo Biggie in a backpack, purse or other bag while it’s filled with liquid?
A: No. Don't put a full and expanded Stojo Biggie into your bag. The Stojo Biggie wasn't designed to be a bottle or flask. When we say the Stojo Biggie is ""leak-proof"", we mean that it's designed to be collapsed, sealed and stowed away without you having to stop and rinse it out. When it is empty, collapsed and properly sealed, residual coffee, tea or other beverage won't make a mess in your bag or pocket. 
Q: Are the materials BPA and phthalate free?
A: Yes.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I'm Luke Barrow. My wife is Devon Brooks. We manage and maintain several cabins adjacent to our property and rent them to tourists. In the last couple of years we have upgraded our cabins and have completed some extensive additions to our house as well, expanding to accommodate groups in a retreat setting. This is going very well; we are providing a very different type of ""all inclusive"" where our guests are immersed in nature  and still have amenities like wi-fi and a pool. We're only 10 minutes from the beaches and within an hour of some of Costa Rica's most spectacular nature, yet less than 4 hours from airport and capital San Jose.</p>
<h1><b>But wait, there's more...</b></h1>
<p>We've made great strides. Our skills in construction, gardening, hospitality, art and 'jungle living' have transformed our property and have been shared with hundreds of guests from around the globe. But we're not done yet. It's time to use these skills in a very ambitious expansion project that will create three additional rental units and a spacious open pavilion to be used for yoga retreats or other group and family activities.</p>

Imagine the Ewok village in ""Star Wars"". Now blend the two together in a custom-designed ""Hobbit Hut"", built into the side of the mountain. The floors will be concrete with river stone walls on three sides (think of a root cellar, but not creepy and dark!). The front walls will be constructed with rustic posts and closed in with a half wall and screening to keep the space as open and airy as possible while protecting guests from the elements. The roof will be constructed of bamboo and thatch, allowing more air-flow and maintaining the tropical style. Each Hobbit Hut will have a small kitchen, 2 bathrooms and beds for four adults in a 350 (+/-) square foot footprint. </p>

<p>My name is Jesse Holt.</p>
<p> I have spent a lifetime experiencing the wonders of camping. My co-founder Mahi has used his tech companies to fund his love of travel and adventure. </p>
<p>  So what keeps people from camping?</p>
<p> Well first off it takes a small fortune to buy all the stuff you need. And that doesn't even include an RV!</p>
<p> Second, once you buy all the stuff it can be a HUGE project to prep everything set it all up, break it all down then store it all until the one trip next year. </p>
<p>  What if now going camping was as easy as going to a hotel?</p>
<p> You simply pull up to a spot that is set up and ready. Put your food and ice in the cooler and enjoy the trip of a lifetime with your family.</p>
<p>  Oh and also for those of you that already spent the fortune on all the gear, now you can turn it into a great income! You can make thousands just setting it up for others to enjoy. </p>
<p> We just need a little help from you!</p>
<p>We have decided to run a campaign based on percentages rather than dollars. The money raised from this campaign will determine how quick we can grow. </p>
<p> Mahi and I have both been able to use our previous companies, and a very lean model to get us to a point that we can launch in a small market. But we need your help to make this company what it can be. With enough help we can be in all 50 states by 2020. </p>
<p> Here is a breakdown on how we will use the funding for growth</p>
<p>Financial plan for Campezz July - September</p>
<p> 10% of every dollar will be placed into retained earnings. This will be an emergency fund. Once fund reaches six months of operating expenses we will use extra funds to buy assets in cash. </p>
<p> 10% will be used for business growth. This will initially be used for corporation set up. Trademark fees, legal documents etc. Will also be used to open next market. Travel expenses permits etc. </p>
<p> Remaining 80% will be divided into two categories, marketing and tech development. </p>

<p> Tech development -</p>
<p>Over the next three months all tech money will be used on app development. </p>
<p>One of our biggest risks is the ever present problem of someone bigger than us beating us to market. It has been a concern since we started creating this company. We were even a little nervous to go to Indigogo to be honest. </p>
<p> We do feel however that we have two major advantages in our market. Speed and experience. We are a small company and we control every part of it in house. From logistics to app design. Decisions and ideas happen very fast! Sometimes a little to fast and Mahi has to tell me to slow down! </p>
<p> What we do better than anyone though is experience. We know camping, we know travel, we know technology. There is no better team for a project like this. We live and love this life style. Spending all of our free time out in the Real World! Camping, boating, exploring and enjoying. </p>

</div></div>","Why we choose to share our experience as photography lovers and travel lovers!
Taking the side of the objective means to have a few photos of themselves and the photographs that recall trips are definitely the ones we show proudly to our friends.
There is no better gift to give to yourself when you are on vacation.

Pix Around ltd offers this service to tourists, couples, families and friends who want to travel the world and capture a particular moment in their lives not with simple pictures but turning to professionals. Through our Company we managed to combine our passions, discovering the world and photography.
We personally chose each local photographer based on their style and the emotions transmitted from their photographs.

FRANCESCA & ALESSANDRO
How it works
Some trips deserve more than selfies. Occasions like honeymoons, anniversaries, family holidays, solo adventures and even surprise proposals are perfect moments to capture. Or simply because you believe that memories are the best souvenir and connecting with a local is part of the magic of travel.

<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>What is Tandala?</strong><br/>Tandala Ranch and Eco Farm is a ranch and resort built on one<br/>fundamental principle; the environment. Built in the style of the<br/>traditional African huts and villages we make use of everything this<br/>land has to offer. All the straw-roofed lodges are built with stone<br/>walls gathered from quarries in the area and the roofs are supported by<br/>wood from local trees. We planted and replanted several trees, shrubs,<br/>plants and flowers to accommodate the layout of our ranch. So, basically<br/>we moved things around and have interfered with nature as little as<br/>possible. The vegetables and fruit we grow and the livestock on the<br/>ranch are used solely for consumption for those who live on or visit<br/>Tandala. Excess production of fruit and vegetables is donated to local<br/>schools or projects. Also, our staff is hired from the local villages<br/>so we assist the economic growth of the area as well.<br/>We are not connected to the Kenyan power grid, we use solar power<br/>exclusively; for our restaurant and reception, for the lodges and for<br/>the outdoor lights around the ranch. The water we use is pumped either<br/>from the river or our hand dug wells and filtered, so it can be used<br/>for irrigation and of course to make sure our guests can have a hot<br/>shower after a long dusty day on safari. Drinking water is available in<br/>bottles in the lodges and of course our restaurant only uses bottled<br/>water for the preparation of meals.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Tandala?</strong><br/>Tandala Ranch lies at the foot of Mount Kenya, near the village of Jua<br/>Kali (which means 'strong sun'). The nearest city is called Nanyuki and<br/>is 15 kilometers from Tandala. Our ranch is perfectly situated for<br/>those interested in safari; Ol Pajeta conservancy is only a 15 minute<br/>drive from Tandala and Mpala Wildlife Conservancy can be reached within<br/>30 minutes.The Ol Daiga Hills farm is another good option to see<br/>wildlife.</p>
<p><strong>Is Tandala a place that I would want to visit?</strong><br/>In one word; absolutely. Whether you want to enjoy a safari and see the<br/>Big 5, or if you like bird watching, hiking, biking or enjoy nature or<br/>African culture. <br/>And maybe you simply want to enjoy a restful couple of days in a<br/>beautiful environment away from busy city-life, work, smartphones or e<br/>-mail. In that case Tandala is the place to go. <br/>However, if you enjoy mass tourism Tandala may not be the best<br/>destination for you.</p>
<p><strong>What have you built so far?</strong><br/>Tandala Ranch currently consists of; 2 fully functional lodges (hot<br/>shower and toilet, queen-size bed), a reception area, art gallery and relax area, a bar, a traditional grill restaurant, a riverside open air lunch grill and an outside bar overlooking both Mount Kenya and one of the smaller dams on the ranch. Tandala also has a vegetable and fruit garden of over 3 acres (potatoes, onions, garlic, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, avocados,<br/>bananas, mango's among others) and several livestock pens (goats, pigs, rabbits and chickens). We have dug three water wells to make use of the ground water and we have three pumps to pump water from the river and 4 storage tanks to hold the water until it is needed. We have installed solar panels on all the roofs of the existing buildings to provide electricity.<br/>Also our staff lives on the ranch and they have their own traditional African style village consisting of four huts. Staff working in the vegetable garden have their own African style huts set between the banana trees.</p>
<p><strong>What remains to be done?</strong><br/>First, for our <u>Primary Goal ($50.000)</u> we aim to complete the lodges so<br/>that we have six fully operational lodges with a capacity of twelve<br/>guests at any given time. Also, we want to add several huts to house our<br/>additional staff.<br/>Second, if we reach our <u>Stretched Goal ($90.000)</u> we want to obtain a<br/>permanent water supply by digging several dams on various locations on<br/>the ranch. The river which is currently used to irrigate the vegetable<br/>garden and the plants and flowers on the ranch is running dry more<br/>often and more quickly than in the past and without extra water<br/>capacity we risk losing  part of our vegetation.<br/>Third, if we reach our <u>Super-stretched Goal ($130.000)</u> we intend to<br/>expand the irrigation system (which is currently very labor-intensive<br/>and not as efficient as we would like) and replace the current water<br/>pumps (powered with gasoline) with solar water pumps. In this way we<br/>remain committed to keep Tandala as eco-friendly as possible.<br/>Fourth, if we reach our <u>Ultimate Goal ($170.000)</u> we want to expand our<br/>solar capacity by building a large solar array on top of the roof of<br/>several buildings at the edge of the valley (and out of sight of our<br/>guests). With this expansion we can guarantee electricity at all hours<br/>everywhere on the ranch, so you can feel secure on the lit path to your<br/>lodge, read a book in bed at night for hours and of course be assured of a cold beer after a hot day!</p>
<p><br/>So, this is what we intend to do for the next couple of months. If you<br/>are interested in helping eco-tourism along you are welcome to pledge any amount you like. If you intend to visit Kenya for safari in the future you may want to look at the perks that award free nights of stay in our lodges and give you free breakfast, lunch and diner for those days as well!<br/>N.B.: Please note that with all perks on offer, drinks and alcohol are not<br/>included. Also note that perks are for a lodge for 2 persons and 2<br/>person meals! So basically you can imagine that our perks are in many<br/>cases a pre-investment to your future holiday.<br/>And best of all; even when we do not hit our target(s), the perks you<br/>paid for are redeemable any time in the future anyway!<br/>Just remember to contact us for availability and reservation details before you book your trip to Kenya. Tandala Ranch officially opens its doors on July 1st 2017.</p>
<p>N.B.: All perks expire at July 1st 2019.</p>
<p>You may want to look at our website <a href=""http://www.tandala-birding-resort.com/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.tandala-birding-resort.com/en/</a>  and view our photo gallery to have a look at Tandala Ranch and Eco Farm. <br/>It is nearly impossible to give you an idea of the beauty and serenity<br/>of Tandala with only a couple of photos, but it will give you some idea what you can expect.<br/>As one guest told us recently; ""The photos on your website don't do<br/>justice to the view I am looking at right now. If I had known it would<br/>look like this, I would have come much sooner.""</p>
<p>Ecotourism is booming in Kenya, but we feel confident that nowhere in<br/>Kenya (nor in Africa for that matter) you will find a place quite like<br/>Tandala.</p>
<p>Imagine a valley near the river, filled with a sea of several shades of<br/>green from the treetops, occasionally interrupted by the bright colors<br/>of orange, red, yellow and white of our beautiful flowers while at the<br/>background you can admire the majesty of one of the highest snow capped mountains in the world. Imagine sitting by your campfire at night admiring the clear starlit sky. Then imagine that you can visit such a place and live for a few moments in a paradise with an authentic African<br/>atmosphere, while enjoying the facilities, hospitality and quality of a modern resort.</p>
<p>Welcome to Tandala Ranch.<br/>  </p>
</div></div>","What is Tandala?Tandala Ranch and Eco Farm is a ranch and resort built on onefundamental principle; the environment. Built in the style of thetraditional African huts and villages we make use of everything thisland has to offer. All the straw-roofed lodges are built with stonewalls gathered from quarries in the area and the roofs are supported bywood from local trees. We planted and replanted several trees, shrubs,plants and flowers to accommodate the layout of our ranch. So, basicallywe moved things around and have interfered with nature as little aspossible. The vegetables and fruit we grow and the livestock on theranch are used solely for consumption for those who live on or visitTandala. Excess production of fruit and vegetables is donated to localschools or projects. Also, our staff is hired from the local villagesso we assist the economic growth of the area as well.We are not connected to the Kenyan power grid, we use solar powerexclusively; for our restaurant and reception, for the lodges and forthe outdoor lights around the ranch. The water we use is pumped eitherfrom the river or our hand dug wells and filtered, so it can be usedfor irrigation and of course to make sure our guests can have a hotshower after a long dusty day on safari. Drinking water is available inbottles in the lodges and of course our restaurant only uses bottledwater for the preparation of meals.
Where is Tandala?Tandala Ranch lies at the foot of Mount Kenya, near the village of JuaKali (which means 'strong sun'). The nearest city is called Nanyuki andis 15 kilometers from Tandala. Our ranch is perfectly situated forthose interested in safari; Ol Pajeta conservancy is only a 15 minutedrive from Tandala and Mpala Wildlife Conservancy can be reached within30 minutes.The Ol Daiga Hills farm is another good option to seewildlife.
Is Tandala a place that I would want to visit?In one word; absolutely. Whether you want to enjoy a safari and see theBig 5, or if you like bird watching, hiking, biking or enjoy nature orAfrican culture. And maybe you simply want to enjoy a restful couple of days in abeautiful environment away from busy city-life, work, smartphones or e-mail. In that case Tandala is the place to go. However, if you enjoy mass tourism Tandala may not be the bestdestination for you.
What have you built so far?Tandala Ranch currently consists of; 2 fully functional lodges (hotshower and toilet, queen-size bed), a reception area, art gallery and relax area, a bar, a traditional grill restaurant, a riverside open air lunch grill and an outside bar overlooking both Mount Kenya and one of the smaller dams on the ranch. Tandala also has a vegetable and fruit garden of over 3 acres (potatoes, onions, garlic, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, avocados,bananas, mango's among others) and several livestock pens (goats, pigs, rabbits and chickens). We have dug three water wells to make use of the ground water and we have three pumps to pump water from the river and 4 storage tanks to hold the water until it is needed. We have installed solar panels on all the roofs of the existing buildings to provide electricity.Also our staff lives on the ranch and they have their own traditional African style village consisting of four huts. Staff working in the vegetable garden have their own African style huts set between the banana trees.
What remains to be done?First, for our Primary Goal ($50.000) we aim to complete the lodges sothat we have six fully operational lodges with a capacity of twelveguests at any given time. Also, we want to add several huts to house ouradditional staff.Second, if we reach our Stretched Goal ($90.000) we want to obtain apermanent water supply by digging several dams on various locations onthe ranch. The river which is currently used to irrigate the vegetablegarden and the plants and flowers on the ranch is running dry moreoften and more quickly than in the past and without extra watercapacity we risk losing  part of our vegetation.Third, if we reach our Super-stretched Goal ($130.000) we intend toexpand the irrigation system (which is currently very labor-intensiveand not as efficient as we would like) and replace the current waterpumps (powered with gasoline) with solar water pumps. In this way weremain committed to keep Tandala as eco-friendly as possible.Fourth, if we reach our Ultimate Goal ($170.000) we want to expand oursolar capacity by building a large solar array on top of the roof ofseveral buildings at the edge of the valley (and out of sight of ourguests). With this expansion we can guarantee electricity at all hourseverywhere on the ranch, so you can feel secure on the lit path to yourlodge, read a book in bed at night for hours and of course be assured of a cold beer after a hot day!
So, this is what we intend to do for the next couple of months. If youare interested in helping eco-tourism along you are welcome to pledge any amount you like. If you intend to visit Kenya for safari in the future you may want to look at the perks that award free nights of stay in our lodges and give you free breakfast, lunch and diner for those days as well!N.B.: Please note that with all perks on offer, drinks and alcohol are notincluded. Also note that perks are for a lodge for 2 persons and 2person meals! So basically you can imagine that our perks are in manycases a pre-investment to your future holiday.And best of all; even when we do not hit our target(s), the perks youpaid for are redeemable any time in the future anyway!Just remember to contact us for availability and reservation details before you book your trip to Kenya. Tandala Ranch officially opens its doors on July 1st 2017.
N.B.: All perks expire at July 1st 2019.
You may want to look at our website http://www.tandala-birding-resort.com/en/  and view our photo gallery to have a look at Tandala Ranch and Eco Farm. It is nearly impossible to give you an idea of the beauty and serenityof Tandala with only a couple of photos, but it will give you some idea what you can expect.As one guest told us recently; ""The photos on your website don't dojustice to the view I am looking at right now. If I had known it wouldlook like this, I would have come much sooner.""
Ecotourism is booming in Kenya, but we feel confident that nowhere inKenya (nor in Africa for that matter) you will find a place quite likeTandala.
Imagine a valley near the river, filled with a sea of several shades ofgreen from the treetops, occasionally interrupted by the bright colorsof orange, red, yellow and white of our beautiful flowers while at thebackground you can admire the majesty of one of the highest snow capped mountains in the world. Imagine sitting by your campfire at night admiring the clear starlit sky. Then imagine that you can visit such a place and live for a few moments in a paradise with an authentic Africanatmosphere, while enjoying the facilities, hospitality and quality of a modern resort.

<p><a href=""https://women2.co/@julietaeko"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Julia Taeko; Journalist for Women 2.0 </a>summed up Omima M.

<p>From hosting and sponsoring educational competitions for students, serving on multiple committees within the American Chamber of Commerce Japan and working in the entrainment industry as an author/screenwriter, her past and current endeavors supporting local communities created an impressive track record inspiring many of the younger generation and gaining positive recognition from larger companies and influential individuals looking to support her endeavors. </p>
<p>To all those reading, having the odds against her in Japan is fair to acknowledge (single parent, working mom, foreigner, young). However, she never claims any of those points to be a challenge, but the day to day dilemma of bearing her body art is another story!  Depending on where she is if the tattoo is visible it could be seen as unprofessional or untraditional. ""When you're in a room and everyone is wearing business suits, you shouldn't be focused on each others ""birthday suits and when you're at a public bath you shouldn't be focused on trying to identify someone's work background because they're not wearing a suit and sporting a tattoo."" Miki states just before her <a href=""http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/12/31/national/media-national/hot-spring-developer-open-facility-caters-even-visitors-tattoos/#.WHR38bZ97q0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">interview with journalist Jake Adelstein of The Japan Times. </a></p>
<h3>Which brings us to now - </h3>
<p>During a television interview Miki lightly jokes, ""When the doors of an onsen close, a new onsen opens—with much bigger doors!"" </p>
<p>Going to the beach, gym, hot springs is something that many people enjoy doing even in Japan and that includes people with tattoos. Mina Mizu Hot Springs will welcome anyone with a tattoo and anyone who appreciates the art form, but it’s also providing an objective history of the tattoo industry in Japan with an artistic, high-tech digital interior. It has an important, two-fold mission — to help Japanese and foreigners understand the history of tattoos, and normalize the image of tattoos in Japan.</p>
<p>Mina Mizu is set to launch during Golden Week of 2019 an appropriate timeframe with enough breathing room for the following year when Japan hosts the<a href=""https://tokyo2020.jp/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> 2020 Olympic games</a>.  </p>
<h2>So what else makes this onsen different - </h2>
<p>Because this is a<u> tattoo inspired</u> onsen, Mina Mizu plans to honor and showcase a digital hands-on lounge/showroom appreciating of the art-form's past and present. After all tattoos are another way of telling a story, so why not tell the WHOLE HISTORY visually and beautifully!</p>
<p>Mina Mizu's designs will bring forth a unique high tech concept that now can be associated with water.

Besides the customary female and male onsens, the facility will also have a family (co-ed) swimming pool, as well as a 30-room ryokan, or Japanese style hotel, an Izikaya, Japanese style bar, and the previously mentioned showroom / lounge that will be designed to showcase the history of tattoos in Japan. </p>
<p>The most exceptional part of the onsen is the Feng Shui architectural embellishments/installations of the interior and exterior décor—another tribute to highlight the significance of symbolism on the body. </p>

<p>It's not just enough to have the support of partnering companies. We need the support of communities who share these like-minded endeavors. In order to break down discriminating barriers for residences and foreigners, who love Japan and just want to enjoy one of the many perks japan has to offer, it's imperative to move forward together. </p>

</p>
<p>""Bevo Goes to Prague"" is the title given to the Prague Quadrennial (PQ) 2015 project submitted by the Design and Production graduate students in the Department of Theatre and Dance. PQ is an event held every four years in Prague to celebrate and explore space in Performance Design on an international scale. Our students proposed a project to PQ for the ""Tribes"" section of the event. Through this project, each group is tasked with exploring the idea of what makes a ""tribe"" and designing, creating, and performing these ideas at PQ in June 2015. For our project, we looked directly to the source which inspired us. Bevo, the longhorn, has long been an emblem of the University and of Texas pride. We, as artists, wanted to explore the ideas of how fine arts students can identify as a longhorn and share in the university's long held prestige. This experience will be created by employing UT Austin traditions, and giving them a theatrical turn, including longhorn head masks, nods to the Torch Rally, and the ubiquitous ""Eyes of Texas"" anthem.</p>

   What We Need & What You Get 
All funding received for this project will go directly into helping our students travel to Prague for the Quadrennial. All funding will be divided equally among the fifteen students who have been accepted to the event.

We are looking to raise $20,000 to help us travel to Prague for this amazing opportunity! 
All funds raised, will be divided amongst us evenly to help cover the out of pocket expenses that come with international travel.
Many of our team has never traveled internationally before, and you can provide them with the opportunity to experience other cultures and ideas!    The Impact 

This project will give the unique educational opportunity for all of the students attending a chance to be seen on a international level, as well as the ability to create and see art from all around the world pertaining to the performing arts. This event will also increase the likelihood of our students networking and making international connections that can create working relationships through different countries and cultures.

Upon c<span><span>loser examination of the details they show that delayed bags comprised 81.2% of the total mishandled bags. Damaged or pilfered bags account for 15.5% of mishandled bags and 3.3% were declared lost or stolen.

<p>The basic Lockee was designed for the traveler that desires a
certain level of comfort and reduced anxiety about one of the airline industry’s
most critical issues, lost, stolen, or mishandled luggage.  The Lockee founder experienced this problem
and had a family vacation ruined, so he invented the Lockee as his answer.  </p>

<p>The Lockee is a GSM-powered locking, tracking, and location
device that will alert you the moment your Luggage moves unexpectedly or the
lock is tampered with and it begins tracking it to an exact location.  The Lockee is a new breed of tracking devices
that are using Bluetooth in combination with sensors and your Smartphone to
track your luggage on a map, lock and unlock it without a physical key, and receive
an alert if it's moved out of a certain zone.</p>

<p>The idea of the Lockee project came as an epiphany in early 2014 on a joint family vacation abroad. We arrived at our beautiful vacation destination and Alexander’s wife discovered her suitcase was missing and the airline had no idea where or how they were going to locate and return the luggage. This obviously had a very negative impact on this exquisite holiday event.  The silver lining, was that this incident became the impetus, for the creation of the Lockee project as a baggage tracking and locking feature.</p>
<p>We began the process of market research and were astonished by the statistics. In 2013 there were more than 28 million bags lost worldwide and this staggering statistic does not include the theft of luggage. These stunning statistics led our team to create a prototype of the Lockee product and we are launching an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign on December 8th 2015 to begin the production process in middle 2015. During this Indiegogo campaign we will pre-sell the device to attract and grow our global market.</p>

<b>So The Lockee looks similar to a few other projects I've have seen?
</b><p>The Lockee may appear similar to other projects you have seen, but our use of GSM network technology, the sturdy armored locking cable, the keyless fingerprint biometric access and the durable waterproof case differentiates the Lockee from any other model on the market!! </p>
<h4>Did you say I can also use the web?</h4>
<p>Yes, we have designed an interface where you can use to remotely control your Lockee using your smartphone and using the web</p>
<h4>What is the battery life?</h4>
<p>The Lockee’s Lithium-ion battery provides autonomous operation for up to 14 days, and also has the ability to recharge the Lithium-ion battery using a transfer single from a base station of the GSM network, or a simple mechanism to connect to a desktop or laptop computer for the convenient recharging of the Lithium-ion battery </p>
<h4>When can I expect my Lockee tracker?</h4>
<p>Our goal is to ship the first bulk units towards the end of April-May-June 2015. We have worked closely with our manufactures over the last year, providing prototypes and designs so that once funding has been completed that we can push the button and get delivery.</p>
<h4>How can I find out more information?</h4>
<p>We value your input, so please use the contact items in this campaign and we will get back to you within 8 hours of your request. Were working around the clock to deliver an application and hardware device that you enjoy and want to shout about. Feel free to leave a comment or question at this email us at info @ mylockee.com</p>
<h4>What phones and devices will work with the Lockee?</h4>
<p>The Lockee will work with iOS and Android and we are working on compatibility with other platforms.</p>
<h4>Are you sure I won’t have a problem with Airport security?</h4>
<p>We have done our due diligence making sure that the device complies with travel industry standards. We have flown with prototypes all over the world many times, and we have never experienced any problems. We’ve gone through airport security like a breeze!  </p>
<h4>Does Lockee use GPS?</h4>
<p>No, the Lockee uses GSM network technology, which stands for Global System for Mobile communications and was the dominant 2G digital mobile phone standard for most of the world. It determines the way in which mobile phones communicate with the land-based network of towers. GSM uses cell phone towers to triangulate the position of the device.</p>
<h4>Do I have to set my Lockee on flight mode, and how do I do it?</h4>
<p>Regulations are constantly changing so its hard to be sure about the future. Currently as it stands you would not need to switch into airplane mode in USA or Europe. In some places where regulations are more strict it may be required. No worries, it can be done very easily from your phone.</p>
<h4>Are there any countries in which Lockee will not operate?</h4>
<p>Lockee works anywhere in the world! It does not depend on any third party network in order to work properly. </p>
<h4>Am I supposed to manually add shipping?</h4>
<p></p>
<p>When we create our perks on Indiegogo, we set the shipping costs
and indicated whether a perk ships to one county, a handful of countries, one
region, or anywhere in the world. So as a supporter of this project on only
provides you shipping address, you will see the correct shipping amount
automatically added to the final contribution amount.</p>
<h4>Can I pick a color when I order?</h4>
<p>We will have two colors Black and White as illustrated below in the graphic.</p>

In 2014, the total number mishandled bags  by the airline industry was 26.2 million. Upon closer examination of the details they show that delayed bags comprised 81.2% of the total mishandled bags. Damaged or pilfered bags account for 15.5% of mishandled bags and 3.3% were declared lost or stolen. Mishandled bags cost the airline industry a total of $2.09 US billion in 2014, so reducing expenditure on mishandled bags would have a positive impact on the airline industry's bottom line and provide an improved customer experience.﻿The Lockee is a unique and innovative ""Smart
Technology"" product that provides the traveler with the ability to lock,
track, and locate their luggage by securing the bag with the Lockee device and
tracking it with an app on their Smartphone, but what differentiates the Lockee
from similar products on the market is that once your lost or mishandled
baggage is located Lockee, through a global partnership, will return your
property within a 48 hour time frame.  
The Lockee is fully TSA compliant and accepted because we know
that the world we live in today has many threats so security checks are an
unavoidable part of and are absolutely necessary for our safety. In some
countries, TSA’s standardized keys can securely unlock and re-lock travel locks
on luggage pieces undergoing security checks. TSA agents are authorized to cut
and dispose of any locks that can’t be unlocked using the TSA Master Keys. Remember
the Lockee was designed with customer convenience in mind.The Lockee is the prime example of a “Smart Technology”
driven product designed to meet the needs of its customers. The Lockee uses
SMs-GSM Networks to enhance its ability to act as a global tracking device that
provides the user with state-of the-art locking, tracking, and location
capabilities that are conveniently accessed by one’s ubiquitous Smartphone. 
The Lockee is an extremely versatile locking and tracking device that has multiple applications in the day-to-day lives of its owners. This unique and innovative device can be attached to your luggage and used both as a locking and tracking mechanism that can be monitored on your smartphone. If your luggage is lost the Lockee will provide an exact location for your belongings and you can contact one of our many international partners and our global return service will promptly return your baggage anywhere in the world within 48 hours!
The Lockee features a remotely controlled lock or open mechanism for user convenience. The application of the Lockee is designed to monitor all Lockee devices with these simple steps. The Smartphone app receives any notification about a change in the status of all Lockee devices. The Lockee was designed with the consumer in mind, so they operate on the three most common operating systems iOS, Android, and Windows phone that allow the maximum reach to the global Smartphone owners. 
The Lockee provides a secure unique bond between the device and its owner that prohibits anyone else from interacting with a particular Lockee device. Contacts of the user are entered into the application and transmitted to the Lockee and this data is obtained by using NFC technology which will be necessary for the 48 hour return of the Luggage to its owner.



Crowdfunding is an alternative funding solution that has allowed countless entrepreneurs to fund their dreams. Crowdfunding is a very labor intensive undertaking that requires the entrepreneur’s total focus and commitment to the promoting and marketing the project, but the reality is that once the project is funded the real work begins. Manufacturing is vital! You must be able to transform your prototype into a mass produced product. Manufacturing is especially complicated and complex.



The Lockee is a multi-functional “Smart Technology” driven device that has integrated all of the existing cutting-edge technologies for locking and tracking luggage, monitoring cars, bikes, and our loved ones into a compact lock/tracker synced to a Smartphone app. And this level design technology and functionality are only possible from the intense work ethic and innovation of leading engineers and designers. Prototyping and mass production are two vastly different skill sets. One of the major issues plaguing the crowdfunding industry is the inability of creators to take a product from prototype to manufactured and delivered product.

The Lockee has had the foresight to develop a partnership with APK COM, a manufacturing concern that has been in business since 1994. Their production facilities are based on a mutual partnership with Siemens, where all technological operations to be combined on a single platform. All the equipment on the production floor is modern and powerful. For example, Hitachi SIGMA G5 machine is capable of producing more than 200k components per hour and this factory is in close proximity to the developers of the Lockee project. Lockee has these manufacturing capabilities in place and is prepared to begin mass manufacturing in early 2016 at these regionally located state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities.








The basic Lockee was designed for the traveler that desires a
certain level of comfort and reduced anxiety about one of the airline industry’s
most critical issues, lost, stolen, or mishandled luggage.  The Lockee founder experienced this problem
and had a family vacation ruined, so he invented the Lockee as his answer.  

The Lockee is a GSM-powered locking, tracking, and location
device that will alert you the moment your Luggage moves unexpectedly or the
lock is tampered with and it begins tracking it to an exact location.  The Lockee is a new breed of tracking devices
that are using Bluetooth in combination with sensors and your Smartphone to
track your luggage on a map, lock and unlock it without a physical key, and receive
an alert if it's moved out of a certain zone.



The Lockee is a GSM-powered security device that will alert you the moment your bike moves unexpectedly and begins tracking it if it is stolen. The Lockee is a new breed of tracking devices that are using Bluetooth in combination with sensors and your smartphone to track your bike on a map, unlock it without a physical key, or receive an alert if it's moved out of a certain zone.



The Pendent Lockee is a multi-functional tracking and
location device that has a magnet that can be attached to your car or to a
fleet of vehicles. You simply attach it to a piece of metal using the magnet in
the car or fleet vehicle in a concealed area and now your automobile is
protected. The Lockee’s GSM –powered security device is not attached and
activated, so in one easy step you now have the ability to monitor your car or
fleet vehicles using an app on your Smart phone that will provide an alert if
your vehicle is move and provide an exact real time location on a map of the
vehicle. 

GSM tracking for elderly parents or those with special needs could be the difference between life and death. For those with Alzheimer's or dementia, a GSM tracker can alert a caregiver the instant a special needs patient wanders outside of their home. If the senior GSM tracker exits the home, you'll be notified immediately via text or email. Check on their location in real time right from your PC or smartphone and never worry that they'll go missing again.


Losing sight of your child, whether it's in a crowd or on the way to school, is one of the scariest moments a parent can experience. Thankfully, The Lockee Tracker provides a low-cost means to pinpoint your  child’s location instantly.  The Lockee is a  real-time GSM device that allows you to look up a location directly on your phone. Put your mind at ease with the Lockee as a child tracking solutions.The Lockee GSM tracking device can be used for teenagers, you can be 
comfortable knowing that your teen is hitting the road safely. GSM  vehicle trackers  provide real-time location updates right from your 
smartphone, PC or tablet. The Lockee will encourage your teen driver's 
to practice good habits with a GSM tracker for parents.
A hiking trip is the one vacation that you remember years down the 
road and tell your children about. However, a hike can very easily turn 
dangerous. Every hiker's biggest fear is getting lost in the wilderness.
 The only foolproof way to let people know where you are is through GSM  tracking and the Lockee provides that as a low-cost multi-purpose 
device. 




That
early-morning scramble to find your keys before you leave the house doesn't
have to be so frantic if you have your Lockee Keychain attached to your key
ring.  It is no bigger than a standard
key chain — and even smaller, in some cases — it integrate with your Smartphone
to act as proximity sensors, alerting you when your keys are nearby or in danger
of being left behind. Can you really afford not to have one of these to make those
busy mornings less stressful? 












 










The idea of the Lockee project came as an epiphany in early 2014 on a joint family vacation abroad. We arrived at our beautiful vacation destination and Alexander’s wife discovered her suitcase was missing and the airline had no idea where or how they were going to locate and return the luggage. This obviously had a very negative impact on this exquisite holiday event.  The silver lining, was that this incident became the impetus, for the creation of the Lockee project as a baggage tracking and locking feature.
We began the process of market research and were astonished by the statistics. In 2013 there were more than 28 million bags lost worldwide and this staggering statistic does not include the theft of luggage. These stunning statistics led our team to create a prototype of the Lockee product and we are launching an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign on December 8th 2015 to begin the production process in middle 2015. During this Indiegogo campaign we will pre-sell the device to attract and grow our global market.
















So The Lockee looks similar to a few other projects I've have seen?
The Lockee may appear similar to other projects you have seen, but our use of GSM network technology, the sturdy armored locking cable, the keyless fingerprint biometric access and the durable waterproof case differentiates the Lockee from any other model on the market!! 
Did you say I can also use the web?
Yes, we have designed an interface where you can use to remotely control your Lockee using your smartphone and using the web
What is the battery life?
The Lockee’s Lithium-ion battery provides autonomous operation for up to 14 days, and also has the ability to recharge the Lithium-ion battery using a transfer single from a base station of the GSM network, or a simple mechanism to connect to a desktop or laptop computer for the convenient recharging of the Lithium-ion battery 
When can I expect my Lockee tracker?
Our goal is to ship the first bulk units towards the end of April-May-June 2015. We have worked closely with our manufactures over the last year, providing prototypes and designs so that once funding has been completed that we can push the button and get delivery.
How can I find out more information?
We value your input, so please use the contact items in this campaign and we will get back to you within 8 hours of your request. Were working around the clock to deliver an application and hardware device that you enjoy and want to shout about. Feel free to leave a comment or question at this email us at info @ mylockee.com
What phones and devices will work with the Lockee?
The Lockee will work with iOS and Android and we are working on compatibility with other platforms.
Are you sure I won’t have a problem with Airport security?
We have done our due diligence making sure that the device complies with travel industry standards. We have flown with prototypes all over the world many times, and we have never experienced any problems. We’ve gone through airport security like a breeze!  
Does Lockee use GPS?
No, the Lockee uses GSM network technology, which stands for Global System for Mobile communications and was the dominant 2G digital mobile phone standard for most of the world. It determines the way in which mobile phones communicate with the land-based network of towers. GSM uses cell phone towers to triangulate the position of the device.
Do I have to set my Lockee on flight mode, and how do I do it?
Regulations are constantly changing so its hard to be sure about the future. Currently as it stands you would not need to switch into airplane mode in USA or Europe. In some places where regulations are more strict it may be required. No worries, it can be done very easily from your phone.
Are there any countries in which Lockee will not operate?
Lockee works anywhere in the world! It does not depend on any third party network in order to work properly. 
Am I supposed to manually add shipping?

When we create our perks on Indiegogo, we set the shipping costs
and indicated whether a perk ships to one county, a handful of countries, one
region, or anywhere in the world. So as a supporter of this project on only
provides you shipping address, you will see the correct shipping amount
automatically added to the final contribution amount.
Can I pick a color when I order?
We will have two colors Black and White as illustrated below in the graphic.

Each and every project carries with it certain risks. The most common risks are potential delays in tooling, obtaining raw materials, packaging, and shipping. While we feel like we have reduced these variables as much as possible, they can never be completely eliminated.

We feel our experience and familiarity with our manufacturer and the product development process gives us a unique skill set in handling unexpected problems. Most importantly, we will make sure to give frequent updates about progress so you'll always be informed about the status of the project. We think you'll find our transparency to be a breath of fresh air.",52.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div>","Welcome to Our Adventure.

We are a collection of raggedy 20-somethings planning for what is often described as the greatest adventure in the world. Representing three continents, Henry and Morgan (New Zealand), Milena (Argentina), and Brian (U.S.A) will join 500 other cars crossing from London to the European continent on July 16th commencing on a trip through up to 40 countries, eight time zones and 10,000 miles. Rally Rule #1 dictates that outside our four doors there is no support, no tow trucks, no phone-an-F1-mechanic-friend, just a map, our wits, and an emergency tow rope. Rally organisers offer no direction, only a deadline, how long we take and the route we follow is over to us.



I'd love to join, but I've got an ummm family emergency and/or illnesses... 
Not everyone can be there with us, so followers will be treated to daily* updates, photos, videos, and personal blogs, giving you the opportunity to live vicariously through us as we travel east through the most intense cultural landscapes on the planet. Arguments with armed border guards, fermented goats milk, language barriers, mechanical failures on lonely kazakh roads, these are the things that will make this rally the most interesting thing on the internet since the Dos Equis guy! Follow our adventures and thank yourselves that you had the good sense not to come with us! Did we mention rule #2 yet? Our car, our chariot, our noble steed must not exceed 1000cc's, barely big enough to fit four children, let alone four fully grown adults. And their belongings and a spare tire.

the route

Lending a Hand
We would love for you to follow us on our travels but we need your support. No, we are not a charity, but the third and final rule of the Mongol Rally is that we must raise awareness and money for a couple. A minimum of GBP£1000/ USD$1400/ NZD$2100 between two charities, to be precise. The International Rescue Committee provides emergency relief, and long term humanitarian aid to displaced persons and refugees, offering medical services, international development, and education to help refugees settle and become self sufficient. They are regarded as being among the most transparent, accountable, and financially responsible organisations worldwide with a rating of 95.04/100 on charity navigator. 




Cool Earth is the official charity of the Mongol rally, these guys work to save rainforests through purchasing land and leaving it in protective trusts, and offer continued support through with education, employment, and volunteers. Both of these organisations do immensely important work and we're so proud and excited to be a part of support them!

As such I stayed in my room/home for 3 yrs hardly going out due to the pain and imbalance.  (Xrays/Pics at the bottom of page).<br/>During this time the Bible became my companion and I began to make myself Bible videos so I would not slip into depression and anger at life's curveball.  Then I thought, well, maybe it would be better to put it on youtube and let others be blessed as well. So I started a website <a href=""http://VisualBible.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://VisualBible.info</a> <br/>Later I decided to work on articles and people asked if I could translate the articles in various languages so they could use them in their churches etc. So I began to invest all my time, money and energy into translation work.  Thus began the new project: <a href=""http://Worshipper.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://Worshipper.info</a> <br/>1-5 languages would be manageable but we're translating them into 50 languages, a very pricey project and funds have depleted.<br/>I also wanted to work on an illustrated Bible project <a href=""http://BibleAce.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://BibleAce.com</a> but could not get the funding I needed to pay the artists. Hopefully with your help I can start again.</p>

</div></div>","Translation of Biblical Literature Worshipper.info & VisualBible.info 3 years ago I was involved in a car accident that damaged over 10 bones from neck right down the whole spine. As such I stayed in my room/home for 3 yrs hardly going out due to the pain and imbalance.  (Xrays/Pics at the bottom of page).During this time the Bible became my companion and I began to make myself Bible videos so I would not slip into depression and anger at life's curveball.  Then I thought, well, maybe it would be better to put it on youtube and let others be blessed as well. So I started a website http://VisualBible.info Later I decided to work on articles and people asked if I could translate the articles in various languages so they could use them in their churches etc. So I began to invest all my time, money and energy into translation work.  Thus began the new project: http://Worshipper.info 1-5 languages would be manageable but we're translating them into 50 languages, a very pricey project and funds have depleted.I also wanted to work on an illustrated Bible project http://BibleAce.com but could not get the funding I needed to pay the artists. Hopefully with your help I can start again.
I would like to ask you to support these projects in any way you can.Short URL:  http://bit.ly/worshipperEndorsements: http://worshipper.info/endorsements.htmlTestimonials: http://worshipper.info/testimonials.html
   What We Need 
Computer: 
We urgently need a powerful laptop capable of video/movie editing. 
The current laptop soundcard is dead... Which makes video editing extremely rough. 

Translation:


We need at least $1000-2000 to do more translations in 50 languages.

We need stock footage licenses to make our videos.
We currently pay $55 per translator, so it gets pricey real fast.

Music:We are currently producing original music in various countries (and languages). Music is currently being produced in:


UK https://youtu.be/kZP3OGGbhZI

US https://youtu.be/0twQ3ALyad4
Scotland
France https://youtu.be/BAtlpLyuYzg
China (Mandarin) https://youtu.be/mQ_xgLT3xzM
India (Tamil)
Malaysia https://youtu.be/OHgXWNT-NV4
Turkey (Turkish/English) https://youtu.be/8eY0CORbeiY
Ireland (Irish/English)
Serbia
etc

Genre: Blues, Jazz, Pop, EDM, Rap, Country, Rock, Folk, Gaelic, etc
  The Impact The videos are uploaded on youtube and we make them accessible freely to everyone to use for ministry (non commercial), without having to write us for license to use in church, school, ministry etc.  You are welcome to freely download the videos using  a youtube downloader.  The videos and articles are being used by many people around the world.
    Risks & Challenges Our money is totally spent on the multilingual translations and we need help to continue this Bible project.

</p><p><i>Some time ago, I was home,

becoming a <i>homeless layabout who lives and sleeps on the
streets </i><i>, I am attempting to restart
my career by creating a product that everyone will learn to love, a product
everyone will find hard to live without,  a product I have engineered.<br/><br/></i>
<p><i>The first croudfunding project
I created, “Plan A”, Did not go according to plan...</i><br/></p><p>              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1265949/files/20150303150702-08976.jpg?1425424022"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Noo, not the funky chicken, although.... that is an idea to consider... Anyway, failing sucks, but it's better than the alternative, which is not trying. So, here I am again with “Plan B”. <br/><br/>The idea was first developed
by McLaren, who had some similar, custom made toolboxes, for their factory.  And the great American manufacturer Craftsman also has a similar ""High End"" toolbox with subwoofer and a elevating screen.<br/><p><em></em></p><p><em><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1262211/files/20150302112722-Mclaren-Factory.jpg?1425324442"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p><em>Source:<a href=""http://gfwilliams.net/a-trip-to-the-mclaren-factory-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://gfwilliams.net/a-trip-to-the-mclaren-factory-2/</a><br/><br/><em>We just went quite a few steps up from that idea.

<p><i>Now you may be asking
yourself, “(<strong>insert your name here</strong>), I am a high powered (<b>insert occupation</b>).
 Why should I, (<strong>insert name again</strong>,) give Filipe and his staff my hard
earned money, just to enable his naïve, pie in sky, dreams of someday possibly
being a neurotic, out of work and suicidal engineer?”  Which is, in all
honesty, a valid, but pretty harsh question.  Take it easy man, we are
just trying here.  Brilliant ideas don’t make companies successful; the people who execute those ideas do.</i></p>
<p><b><i>Here is the trajectory for the
project:</i></b></p>
<p><i><b>Step 1</b> – Raise money</i></p>
<p><i><b>Step 2</b> – Do an </i><i>extensive testing program</i></p>
<p><i><b>Step 3</b> – Spread the word
online and offline</i></p>
<p><i><b>Step 4</b> – Various ""Hollywood style""
wheelings and dealings</i></p>
<p><i><b>Step 5</b> – Take the workshop
world, by storm. </i></p>
<p><i>In all seriousness, starting an
entrepreneur project is something about which we are extremely passionate.
 Over the last few years, the internet has become an amazing medium for
aspiring entrepreneurs to gain notice from every industry.  Many people in
all aspects of product creation have started from a simple twitter feed, and I feel with my past
experience and the talented people I have around me, I have created a product,
that will get the name of our company out there.  </i></p>

 Thanks for stopping by my “awkwardly desperate plea for donations towards
a rerun of my project”, or ADPfDTaROMP for short. 
Some time ago, I was home,
alone listening to music, and thought to myself: - Gotta create a
classic, Gotta do it in an attic…
and so I did!In a concerted effort to delay
becoming a homeless layabout who lives and sleeps on the
streets , I am attempting to restart
my career by creating a product that everyone will learn to love, a product
everyone will find hard to live without,  a product I have engineered.
The first croudfunding project
I created, “Plan A”, Did not go according to plan...              Noo, not the funky chicken, although.... that is an idea to consider... Anyway, failing sucks, but it's better than the alternative, which is not trying. So, here I am again with “Plan B”. The idea was first developed
by McLaren, who had some similar, custom made toolboxes, for their factory.  And the great American manufacturer Craftsman also has a similar ""High End"" toolbox with subwoofer and a elevating screen.Source:http://gfwilliams.net/a-trip-to-the-mclaren-factory-2/We just went quite a few steps up from that idea. We are now in the stage of manufacturing called research in which we choose suppliers, test hardware, and plan a launch schedule.
Now you may be asking
yourself, “(insert your name here), I am a high powered (insert occupation).
 Why should I, (insert name again,) give Filipe and his staff my hard
earned money, just to enable his naïve, pie in sky, dreams of someday possibly
being a neurotic, out of work and suicidal engineer?”  Which is, in all
honesty, a valid, but pretty harsh question.  Take it easy man, we are
just trying here.  Brilliant ideas don’t make companies successful; the people who execute those ideas do.
Here is the trajectory for the
project:
Step 1 – Raise money
Step 2 – Do an extensive testing program
Step 3 – Spread the word
online and offline
Step 4 – Various ""Hollywood style""
wheelings and dealings
Step 5 – Take the workshop
world, by storm. 
In all seriousness, starting an
entrepreneur project is something about which we are extremely passionate.
 Over the last few years, the internet has become an amazing medium for
aspiring entrepreneurs to gain notice from every industry.  Many people in
all aspects of product creation have started from a simple twitter feed, and I feel with my past
experience and the talented people I have around me, I have created a product,
that will get the name of our company out there.  
So, without further delay,
here is our project:
Presume unalike!!! And think outside the box (see what I did there ?)
                                                  ""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.""                                                      Leonardo da VinciRui Galvão Soares, one of our team membersThe Extreme Workstation Toolbox starts off where the original stopped. This visionary idea coming to life... will change the way you use a toolbox, forever!!Visionary people face the same problems everyone else does. But, they commit themselves to finding alternative solutions.EWT-Digital, is the logical toolbox solution, for every car workshop. It is the ultimate solution and, will help bring your business into the 21st Century.So, what makes our product so good?1. Delivers on a singular value proposition in a world-class way2. Simple, intuitive, and anticipates needs3. Exceeds expectations4. Changes the user's life for the betterUntil now no-one has taken much time and effort, to research, and understand the workshop tools market, and how it could be improved, in a highly desirable way, using technology. We have significant experience in the design, delivery, and implementation, of high technology systems. In addition, we have complete understanding of the needs and desires, around the unique workshop market world.Car Workshops can no longer thrive with old strategies in today’s multi-dimensional industry cycle. There are five strategic factors to consider: 1. Re-think the workshop  model 2. Drive tighter connections between your workshop and the digital world. 3. Elevate the in-workshop experience 4. Reboot the diagnostic process 5. Challenge traditional organizational structureDon’t Tweak Your workshop Rethink It End to End                           To help drive profitable growth, we urge mechanics, engineers to completely rethink the workshop format and proactively shift to a new end-state; one that plays a distinct and relevant role given the new automotive configuration, maintenance and repair behaviors and tools, that are here to stay.Computerized cars and standardized interfaces have been a benefit, for auto mechanics and manufacturers worldwide. Thus the time has come to rethink their approach, to retool. and to use new, specific methods and strategies.To quote  Werner Huber from BMW about their BMW i3 electric car that can autonomously park itself : ""We appreciate what Google is doing since they’re promoting the idea of the autonomous car and preparing the ground for us,” said Huber. “But we are coming at it from another side. As a car manufacturer, we are very experienced in building cars and we have to adopt more processes of an IT company.”  (http://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/01/08/car-brands-closing-disconnect-between-mobile-experiences-and-driving)With our Extreme Workstation our clients will have all their charts, tables, testing software , internet and all the tools they may need, in one place. Covering all these needs the Extreme Workstation comes complete with a set of distinct and ever-important features, such as:High Definition Large Screen (also available optional touch screen) USB ports (to allow you to connect your interfaces and any other gear you may need) Power plugs, for every need (mains, usb and 12v supply)Wireless keyboard and mouse Our main goal is to create an affordable toolbox with built in, windows based computer. No more need for a computer and a toolbox. But we have tailored options for every need: A (removable) professional portable computer, connected by a docking station. With this feature you will be able to connect your computer at your workshop as you arrive, take it home afterwords and, next day, connect it at the Extreme Workstation Toolbox, at the race track Pit Box. More affordable models will have their own built in computer We will have other models with multi screen and multi computer capability.The Extreme Workstation Toolbox is a must for any workshop. Your measurements and/or analysis  take place in front of you on a large screen.                                   There will be no more need to work on your lap.                            The large screen will allow you to see every small detail of your schematics and/or measuring software even if you are sitting in a nearby car or near its engine.                 Begin your journey now.With this never-before-seen Toolbox, your workshop will enter the future.Ever hear about a unique business or invention -- something so obvious, you slap yourself on the forehead and say ""Now why didn't I think of that?""That's what EWT-Digital, is all about -- Simple, yet innovative ideas that just make sense.                                    
We start by inviting you to crowdfund the first step of our
journey. In return, we will be providing you with access to the inner workings
of a work force team from its early days of development, revealing information
that is normally a closely guarded secret,  
We are offering you the potential, of being
involved, of getting the feedback and the inner stories. 
Make sure you are ready to embark on this journey. The Extreme Workstation
Toolbox aims to reach the ultimate dream, wich is
to have its place on every major workshop arround the world, even reaching the
motor racing world, and many other exciting places.  One of the reasons that the workshops are going to benefit so much from our services is due to the ability to collect
and analyze data on a global scale.

The
Extreme Workstation Toolbox will appeal to many groups of people, who are interested in cars,
fans, drivers and engineers. We are going to provide them unrivalled access to our
team. Our EWT-Digital WebPage, a knowledge-sharing and e-learning portal
will bring you closer to the action, and will allow you to learn and develop your
own skills in the car world, whether you are an amateur or a professional.
By
creating this new Extreme Workstation and and by using the ""world of the
Internet"", we will bring the Car World
closer together.
Your
help will give us all the chance to be part of the team from the start. We will
create a large community and we will start to see the power of a collective
force that will attract the funds and partners to make this journey a success.
Come and join us, help us create a piece of history.

We will start with a humble engineering workshop in Portugal,
to go on and ""dominate"" the world. 
We are recreating the tool box and its use. We are
creating a product that will be ""The choice"" of all of the new generation top engineers
and car technicians in the world.
The money from the first phase of crowdfunding, will be used
to build a more simplified version of the final product, bringing together, the
elements that are required for you to follow, and contribute, towards our early
progress. From then on, it turns into a much more engaging and powerful goal.
Interact
with us                            
Members of EWT-Digital, will interact and contribute towards
collaborative decisions, in a way no company has attempted before. We
will share everything from our search for the best componentes, right up to the
first work bench build, tested and delivered. This toolbox will become the gateway for live telemetry, measuring, and diagnostic, giving
the major contributors a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the idea involved here.
Major contributors, will have remote access, live camera feed to the machine,
and will be able to work with it ""on spot"".
Our online page will include modules such as:
· 
Understanding the car and advice around set-up  
· 
Developing a creative mentality
· 
Media training
· 
Advice from experts
· 
Suggested ideas from specialists
·  As
well as debriefs when we are testing and diagnosingThere will be a Cloud service with a number of specific related apps at the members disposal
We will
gather people with a lot of experience. This is your chance to get the same
kind of insight, that helped them reach the top.
How your money will be spentYour Contributions will go directly to the hardware, software, location, tools, licensing, website creation/administration, administrative costs, advertising, communications, transportation, shipping & mail basically to get this Project off of the ground.We also aim to have a Toolbox in place, at Autodromo do
Estoril. Major companies (including prestigious F1 teams, who come here often for tests) will be able to use it and “test drive it” on spot. (with multi screen and multi computer capability):            
·  Makes long-term client more likely and
more sustainable
·  Makes sponsorship more attractive to brands
·  Involves fans more than ever before
To put it simply, the more we raise, and the more people
who show their support, the sooner we can develop, the The Extreme Workstation
Toolbox and go places with it
We will provide you with:
·  The front-end of the new EWT-Digital portal
·  Provide you with the ability to watch and
contribute to the team’s initial stages of development
·  The ability to vote and interact on certain
team decisions from the offset
·  Video, written and audio updates, from
the team .
·  A comprehensive prospectus, that will allow us
to go after the next big investment, required to take this idea worldwide, and
make it part of every major workshop arround the world
Stretch Goals
Once we have passed the initial €25.000 target, we can start to
progress the next phases, without requiring additional investment straight away.
When we reach a total of €25,000 we will be able to start
building and creating, more complex experiences straight away, and create the back-office of the team

·  Later, we will look for additional
investment, so we can source our factory, and assembly line.

Show Support
If you would like to simply show support, for The Extreme Workstation
Toolbox, and keep up-to-date, with our progress, you can invest
just one pound. You won’t be participating in the experiences we have lined up,
but your contribution helps confirm to our investors that we’re onto a good
idea.Why share our secrets?
When people hear about The Extreme Workstation Toolbox, they
ask? Why we are happy to give away our secrets, to our competitors. There are two
reasons, transparency gets rid of barriers, that often create disharmony in
a team and, promotes even greater creativity. secondly, if your competitors
can only win, by chasing your tail, then they won’t be able, to hold pace for

Our new Extreme Workstation Toolbox challenges
the current thinking of what a Toobox should be, and modernises the
fan/sponsor relationship. With the birth of the web, and social media, the world
communicates differently, resulting in a change in the way people interact, and
receive their information. This ""world of ideas"", is starting to catch up, but we
feel, it’s ready to go a step further.
In essence, we’re proposing a new model for manufacturing,
one where transparency, and free-flow of information, works to the benefit of the
team, and the benefit of the participating individuals.
We already have several requests for the product, all we need is make it a reality:

                                               



“Please email me more information on the product” - Eric Min“What is the cost and do you have representation in Brasil” - Claudio Sousa“You have like this ?” - Bob G Bitar“We are in the main busines of auto repair tools, we can provide you with measuring tools, and maybe you can provide us with your products” - Linda Li“Can you send to Venezuela? and what are the costs ?” - Enmanuel Rodriguez“I love your product, do you have representation in Brasil ?” - Romeri Cunha SilvaThese are just a few examples...Help us make The Extreme Workstation Toolbox a reality!As with all projects, success is only possible, when you overcome potential challenges.                                        The most important thing, is that people show their support, by participating in the campaign, however they can. An investor would like to see huge uptake, before they put serious money, into funding a project like ours.

<h3><u><strong>The Impact of N'TICE on Pupils, Teachers &amp; Community</strong></u></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>What happens when a teacher connects their travels to the subject matter they teach?  Students will be drawn into the excitement of the adventure, better than any ordinary textbook.  Travel imparts a strong passion for places seen and experiences had. The more excited and enthusiastic the teacher is, the more likely students will also feel that zeal. </p>
<p>Travel also provides countless ways to learn new things and gain new experiences. It can also be awkward and uncomfortable at times. When we travel we are no longer the masters of our domain. Travel serves as a reminder of what it’s like to be a student.  Educators can use this perspective to benefit their teaching and build empathy with their learners.</p>
<p>Understanding cultural differences and approaching pupils within a broader global context can help break down barriers of communication between teachers and students.  The more globally-minded a teacher is, the better the interchange with his or her class.</p>
<p>It is important that teachers have a world perspective in order to create a safe and stimulating classroom environment for all students based on proper communication.  The more well-travelled a teacher is, the better their students will be able to learn from them.</p>
<p>N'TICE will allow teachers to network with educators around the world to share trade techniques and classroom pedagogy.  </p>
<p>Finally, travel replenishes the spirit and rejuvenates the soul-making the teacher more effective when not on recess. </p>

<div>My name is Julien. I come from an extensive background of traveling. From a very young age, I moved a lot around the globe, being influenced by many different cultures. I've spent the last few years doing my own traveling, and developing passions such as music, photography, and film. I worked on a few projects with a organization called Polk County Film Initiative in Tryon, North Carolina. </div>
<div>I've always had the crazy idea of going out, and making my own platform where I could combine multiple different art forms to show people the world. I wanted to inspire people to think for themselves, and see, that with good will, one can figure anything out. I wanted to go on a two month trip to meet people, and launch this platform I've been dreaming of. Traveling across the United States is just one of the many dream trips I've been wanting to do! I didn't know how I was going to afford going on this trip, but I knew that once I threw myself out there, I would have to find the means to make it work. I convinced a good friend of mine to believe in my crazy ideas, and invest partly with me on this gamble, to show the world what we can achieve, and we're making it work! </div>
<div>Where you come into play with your contributions, is all about what I will be able to show the world as I go along. After two weeks of being on the road, my ambitions have grown. I want to show things to my viewership beyond just sleeping in a car. This takes a lot of funding to get the right equipment and for marketing, as well as funds for healthy food, places, people, and monuments to show off on ""We'll Figure It Out's"" pages. </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In order to make more trips like this possible, we need to get people excited about following a platform such as this. We need funding to keep our content golden. When I first started this project, I decided to hold off on crowd funding because I really wanted to already have something to show for first. Now that we have built up a small following, and our pages and vlogs are being updated on a regular basis, it is time for us to take the next step. Originally, when I was talking about this project to some folks, I had people believe in what I believed in, and was about to get some good sponsorship. Unfortunately, this fell through, and it was being postponed way too much for my liking. I was so passionate about getting this started, I took matters into my own hands, and put myself into more debt to get the necessary equipment to at least get something started. Part of this funding is to pay that debt back, in order to be able to focus solely on this project. </p>
<p>Here is where all the money goes:</p>
<p>The money goes towards keeping us alive. We have about 1500$ in debt we already put into this project and we would like to pay it back. Quite frankly I want to be able to keep projects going even when we come back to our home in January. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goals, we will do just what this project is all about. We will take what we have, and make it work. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Hopefully, at the end of this project, we will have an inspirational film to share with the world. We will be able to create a platform in which people can refer to, to find the strength to go forward with their projects. At the end of the day, I hope to get more people on board, start non-profit sub-organizations and projects under this idea, to help around the world with things like; environmental preservation, cultural protection, helping the homeless get back on their feet, pushing for non-violence, improving education, pushing for coexistence between religions, and overall improving the connection between people and their quality of life. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We want to move forward as fast as we can with this project, and the biggest risk and challenges I could see us running into, is becoming discouraged as we run into situations beyond our control traveling through the country. With your support, this minimizes that risk, for we will have something beyond us to protect and cherish. The more support this gets, the more easily we'll be able to figure things out. This platform should ultimately be a communitarian effort. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>We are always looking for passionate people who might be able to offer services to help us move further into this project. If you have any out-of-the-box skills, don't hesitate to contact us at <b>wefiguretravel@gmail.com </b></p>

These are car, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, and ATV replacement tire valve caps that have been handmade using recycled .40 caliber bullet casings. Upon launch, the valve caps received praise and an unexpected growth in sales throughout our Etsy, Amazon, and Ebay stores. During the early stages of production, all of the valve caps were created using personally fired .40 caliber casings ejected from a trusty Glock 23. Due to increasing demand (and sore hands), Hollow-Point Gear now sources and recycles bullet casings from law enforcement and private ranges throughout the country.</p>
<p>Hollow-Point Gear has evolved into a well-rounded BMX, car culture, and tactical lifestyle brand, offering a full line of military-inspired apparel, bullet casing lifestyle accessories, and our highly-rated valve caps. </p>
<p><b>The Products:</b></p>
<p>Our Standard .40 Cal Caps are replacement valve stem caps that have been designed with an actual brass bullet casing and bonded with a fitted screw cap inlay. The bullet casings have been loaded, chambered, fired, and ejected from a .40 caliber firearm. The inlay protects valve stems from rust and corrosion, while the brass holds up well in all conditions and provides protection from dirt, rocks, and whatever other abuse you put your vehicle through. The caps are tough, rugged, and designed to show off your tactical side.</p>

</div></div>","The Brand:
Hollow-Point Gear manufactures high-end valve caps, lifestyle accessories, and military-inspired apparel for BMX riders, car fanatics, and firearm enthusiasts.
In the ballistics world, hollow-point bullets are the uncontested champions. Expanding upon impact, these rounds provide an unparalleled level of transfer of momentum to your target. Hollow-Point Gear will equip you with the momentum to accomplish the main objectives: Style, Power, Confidence, and Success. 

The Story:
Hollow-Point Gear was born from the creation of our .40 Caliber Bullet Casing Valve Caps. These are car, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, and ATV replacement tire valve caps that have been handmade using recycled .40 caliber bullet casings. Upon launch, the valve caps received praise and an unexpected growth in sales throughout our Etsy, Amazon, and Ebay stores. During the early stages of production, all of the valve caps were created using personally fired .40 caliber casings ejected from a trusty Glock 23. Due to increasing demand (and sore hands), Hollow-Point Gear now sources and recycles bullet casings from law enforcement and private ranges throughout the country.
Hollow-Point Gear has evolved into a well-rounded BMX, car culture, and tactical lifestyle brand, offering a full line of military-inspired apparel, bullet casing lifestyle accessories, and our highly-rated valve caps. 
The Products:
Our Standard .40 Cal Caps are replacement valve stem caps that have been designed with an actual brass bullet casing and bonded with a fitted screw cap inlay. The bullet casings have been loaded, chambered, fired, and ejected from a .40 caliber firearm. The inlay protects valve stems from rust and corrosion, while the brass holds up well in all conditions and provides protection from dirt, rocks, and whatever other abuse you put your vehicle through. The caps are tough, rugged, and designed to show off your tactical side.

In summer hiking and winter skiing will be greatly improved by access to these huts.</p><p>In order to break ground, the project needs a further $100,000 before Feb 1st to compliment a large and generous donation by the Kees Brenninkmeyer Foundation and other fundraising efforts we've made to date.</p><p>This is where you come in. By donating to this campaign, you can pre purchase hut nights, while also taking advantage of the other great gear rewards. Your donation will not only support the construction of the hut, but contribute to a rich alpine heritage here in Canada.</p><p>The first hut to be built will be the Kees &amp; Claire Memorial Hut located at Russet Lake near the foot of the iconic Fissile Peak. </p><p>On behalf of the Spearhead Huts Society, thank you for your support. Please share this video and a link to the campaign so that we can achieve the funding goal and begin to realize a world class hut to hut experience in the Whistler Backcountry. </p><h3> </h3><h3>Guided Days and Ski with a Celeb</h3><p>We know you want to get out there and what better way than having a local guide and legendary local skier with you? Local guides such as Brent Phillips, Chris Lawrence, Joe Schwartz and Simon Thomson have graciously donated their guiding services.

In summer hiking and winter skiing will be greatly improved by access to these huts.In order to break ground, the project needs a further $100,000 before Feb 1st to compliment a large and generous donation by the Kees Brenninkmeyer Foundation and other fundraising efforts we've made to date.This is where you come in. By donating to this campaign, you can pre purchase hut nights, while also taking advantage of the other great gear rewards. Your donation will not only support the construction of the hut, but contribute to a rich alpine heritage here in Canada.The first hut to be built will be the Kees & Claire Memorial Hut located at Russet Lake near the foot of the iconic Fissile Peak. On behalf of the Spearhead Huts Society, thank you for your support. Please share this video and a link to the campaign so that we can achieve the funding goal and begin to realize a world class hut to hut experience in the Whistler Backcountry.  Guided Days and Ski with a CelebWe know you want to get out there and what better way than having a local guide and legendary local skier with you?

Another option is a day trip with a pro skier, like Eric Hjorleifson, this experience is guaranteed to up your level of stoke and performance to a whole new level. Robin O'Neill Spearhead PrintsThe landscapes throughout the Spearhead Traverse are jaw-dropping.

<p>Have you ever dreamed of starting your own company or turning something you love to do into a business, only to be held back by lack of money to get started?  If you have, you know one of the largest challenges is funding to launch the idea into a business.  For those that have started a company, it may have been a difficult undertaking to leave the corporate world and start a new path in life, which reminds me of the Robert Frost poem, The Road Not Taken. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise capital for a bicycle tour company, pre-sell tours and promotional items, and raise awareness of my company.  I’ve chosen The Road Not Taken as the name of the company because I think it represents the desire to make a choice and take a risk in life.  I also feel it’s appropriate since many times as bicyclists we look for roads that are not heavily travelled, where one can experience the people and unique sights of the areas we travel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So what is a bicycle tour company?  How does it work?  What does fully-supported mean?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a bicycle tour company, customers purchase a tour / vacation that typically lasts for 5-7 days to ride on bicycles from place to place. While experiencing the sights and points of interest in the region, tour guests stay overnight in the best local hotels and eat at top local restaurants.  Customers could be individuals traveling solo, couples, friends, families, or social/work groups.  Some customers bring their own bicycle but most use a tour company bicycle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The tour company provides leaders on bicycles to guide the tour group turn-by-turn from start to finish each day and help if there are problems.  Being a fully-supported tour means the tour company is able to transport customers in a vehicle if they aren’t able to ride the daily distance due to fatigue, transport customer luggage throughout the tour, pre-arrange accommodations and meals each day, fix mechanical issues, provide drinks and snacks while riding, and any other logistics that make the customer experience memorable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As an example, I have planned a tour of the Erie Canal (about 350 miles from near Albany, NY to Buffalo, NY).  For this tour, we would ride a portion of the way each day while taking time to learn about the history of the Erie Canal, experience notable towns along the way, meet new people, and possibly try new foods too.  I have also planned a jam-packed, 3-day weekend tour of Charleston, SC offering customers the opportunity to bike to local attractions and experience many of the area highlights. I have created tour plans for three other areas in New York State, an epic New York – Canada tour, a South Carolina tour, and will add other States once launched.  The tours will be scheduled in Northern States during summers months and Fall, and in Southern States during non-summer months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who am I and what do I bring to this business? </p>
<p>For much of my life, I’ve lived in New York State and have enjoyed biking in many areas of the “Upstate.”  I have been an avid and active bicyclist since 1991.  During that time, I’ve ridden over 50,000 miles including bike tours and 40+ fund-raising bike rides collecting many thousands of dollars for charities.  I often volunteered as a road leader for charity rides, to assist and guide other riders of varying ability while talking with participants to learn about them, why they ride, and why they supported the particular charity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The feeling of adventure and excitement on a 25 mile ride as a 12-year-old with my best friend or the sense of accomplishment as an adult after completing a one-day, 145-mile solo ride never gets old.  I have always loved exploring new places by bike.  After moving to Charleston, SC almost two years ago, I continue to explore the Charleston, SC area, which has been voted one of the top cities to visit in the country with incredible history, amazing food, and places to see.  I’m thrilled to be turning my love of bicycling into a business that will allow me to experience the feeling of excitement and adventure that others have when discovering the new and interesting places we’ll take them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my career, I worked in the business world for over 30 years, including stints in sales, account management, project management, analytical roles in banking, and in my younger years customer service/hospitality/tourism.  I have a strong understanding of what it takes to provide detailed planning and attentive customer service, balanced with the financial acumen to manage a business.  I’m experienced with managing the details of a project, working with vendors, planning events, and keeping an eye on the budget; all of which are elements required to manage this business. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have performed market research to understand the competition and utilized that information to determine how to position the company in the market and what differentiators will set us apart.  During the process, I examined the daily details of what is required to provide a first-class customer experience.  All of the information went into creating a detailed 5-year business plan, which included examining legal and financial aspects of the business.  I am working with legal and tax accounting professionals, website developer, and marketing with the goal to be operational by July.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Contributions raised from this campaign will be used as follows (these goals include crowdfunding fees):</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Foundational Goal = $15,680</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$7,460 - Develop a web site with ability to accept credit card payments</li>
<li>$2,790 - Legal and tax consultation fees, business licensing, insurance</li>
<li>$4,490 – Marketing; Promotional items</li>
<li>$940 - Supplies, bike tools, and misc. costs</li>
<li>Under this option the business would rent a passenger van and trailer</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Intermediate goal = $33,840</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the above Foundational Goal use of funds, the business would be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,630 - Apply a down payment to purchase a used 15 passenger van to transport customers and crew</li>
<li>$1,840 - Apply a down payment to purchase a used enclosed trailer to carry luggage, bikes, supplies; and modify it for this business purpose</li>
<li>$6,440 - Pay Insurance, licensing, taxes, and associated costs to purchase van and trailer</li>
<li>$3,520 - Strengthen web site SEO and CM, include additional tours</li>
<li>$3,730 - Expand marketing and branding</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stretch goal = $56,700</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the above Intermediate Goal use of funds, the business would be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>$18,900 - Purchase 12 fully equipped, quality bicycles for customer use (including helmet, safety lights, bike computer, seat bag, mirror)</li>
<li>$3,950 - Purchase van and trailer with a larger down payment</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If the campaign raises $33,840 or more by June 17</strong>, I will be able to purchase the passenger van and will volunteer to use the van to transport a local Boy Scout troop to a week long summer camp (300 miles away) at the end of June 2017 (they are currently searching for transportation options).  If in the future the van is not being used for a bicycle tour, I will offer the van as transportation for other Boy Scout camping trips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If the campaign reaches the stretch goal of $56,700</strong>, I will be able to purchase a sufficient number of bicycles for customers so I would be in a position to offer an annual free tour to inner city kids to explore areas such as the historic Erie Canal, the Adirondack or Catskill mountains, or the Finger Lakes region.  This might be done in coordination with The Fresh Air Fund or similar program for kids.  I would also like to do this in Charleston and will continue to gather information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not only do I want to provide a high quality service by offering memorable, fun, outdoor vacation experiences for customers while promoting small local businesses, but it would be great to be in a position to help the organizations mentioned above.  Thanks so much for taking the time to visit this campaign.  Don’t hesitate to ask any questions you might have.  I would greatly appreciate your contribution to make this business a reality.  (Please note all perks will be delivered after the conclusion of the campaign.)</p>
</div></div>","Have you ever dreamed of starting your own company or turning something you love to do into a business, only to be held back by lack of money to get started?  If you have, you know one of the largest challenges is funding to launch the idea into a business.  For those that have started a company, it may have been a difficult undertaking to leave the corporate world and start a new path in life, which reminds me of the Robert Frost poem, The Road Not Taken. 
 
The purpose of this campaign is to raise capital for a bicycle tour company, pre-sell tours and promotional items, and raise awareness of my company.  I’ve chosen The Road Not Taken as the name of the company because I think it represents the desire to make a choice and take a risk in life.  I also feel it’s appropriate since many times as bicyclists we look for roads that are not heavily travelled, where one can experience the people and unique sights of the areas we travel.

I am more than sure that with your support I will be able to do it!</p><p><strong>More about me</strong></p><p>I am downhill mountain biker for five years up till now and I am national champion in masters’ category for 2015. In 2016, because of a collarbone injury at the beginning of the season, I fought back the way the trauma allowed me to and  managed to stay in top 5 for the season. Currently I am a student in National Sports Academy Vasil Levski, trainer profile.</p><p>My nature is to accept brand new challenges! That’s why, one foggy day I tried the relatively new discipline, called enduro mountain bike. I had the chance to participate in enduro workshop leaded by the world champion Jerome Clementz in Borovetz Mountain Bike Park. …and #DownHellYeah, I’d love it! ….so the new idea was born… I decided to go without doubts to the rough downhill-enduro marathon called Megawalanche for the next competing season in 2017.</p><p><strong>Where you will send me to race?</strong></p><p>Megavalanche is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountainbike"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Mountainbike"">mountainbike</a> downhill marathon style event since 1995. The most famous round is run from the French Alps town of Alpe D'Huez, starting on the glaciated summit of the Pic Blanc (3,330m) and descending to the lush meadows of the valley bottom at Allemont (720m), after some 2000 meters down and 30 km along, no matter the weather conditions, with mass start of 350 riders…. that’s event beyond my imagination! But hei, there is no but’s for the Butcher!</p><p>My country doesn’t provide funding for hardcore training preparation of my main sport downhill mountain biking, not even for such brand new discipline as enduro! And that situation urged me to work for this funding campaign. I will use the money for training racing camps, equipment, travel and accommodation expenses.</p><p>I have to admit I’ve never been so motivated to start something such new and challenging! I hope that with all your support along with my friends, family and campaign team help I can achieve it!</p><p><strong>What I need</strong></p><p>I need you! Lets together race in Megavalanche! To have the chance to race there is connected with a lot of expenses which I am looking to cover with your help in this campaign.</p><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody>

I am more than sure that with your support I will be able to do it!More about meI am downhill mountain biker for five years up till now and I am national champion in masters’ category for 2015. In 2016, because of a collarbone injury at the beginning of the season, I fought back the way the trauma allowed me to and  managed to stay in top 5 for the season. Currently I am a student in National Sports Academy Vasil Levski, trainer profile.My nature is to accept brand new challenges! That’s why, one foggy day I tried the relatively new discipline, called enduro mountain bike. I had the chance to participate in enduro workshop leaded by the world champion Jerome Clementz in Borovetz Mountain Bike Park. …and #DownHellYeah, I’d love it! ….so the new idea was born… I decided to go without doubts to the rough downhill-enduro marathon called Megawalanche for the next competing season in 2017.Where you will send me to race?Megavalanche is a mountainbike downhill marathon style event since 1995. The most famous round is run from the French Alps town of Alpe D'Huez, starting on the glaciated summit of the Pic Blanc (3,330m) and descending to the lush meadows of the valley bottom at Allemont (720m), after some 2000 meters down and 30 km along, no matter the weather conditions, with mass start of 350 riders…. that’s event beyond my imagination! But hei, there is no but’s for the Butcher!My country doesn’t provide funding for hardcore training preparation of my main sport downhill mountain biking, not even for such brand new discipline as enduro! And that situation urged me to work for this funding campaign. I will use the money for training racing camps, equipment, travel and accommodation expenses.I have to admit I’ve never been so motivated to start something such new and challenging! I hope that with all your support along with my friends, family and campaign team help I can achieve it!What I needI need you! Lets together race in Megavalanche! To have the chance to race there is connected with a lot of expenses which I am looking to cover with your help in this campaign.

<h3>Qui suis-je ?</h3>
<p>Comme Nathalie célébrée par Gilbert Bécaud en 1962, j'étais sans doute prédestinée à guider les personnes à la découverte du patrimoine local. En effet, de nature curieuse, j'ai toujours fureté à la recherche de trésors méconnus pour agrémenter mes sorties sportives en pleine nature. Et c'est tout naturellement qu'à partir de 2005, j'ai eu envie de partager mes aventures culturelles et sportives avec des amis.</p>
<p>En 2008, j'ai franchi une étape en guidant des groupes, à pieds et à vélo, pour leur permettre de pratiquer leur activité favorite tout en découvrant la région parisienne, loin de la foule. Et ce sont les plus fidèles qui m'ont donné l'idée de professionnaliser cette activité en 2012. Mes expériences professionnelles ayant confirmé mes compétences administratives et commerciales, restait à concrétiser l'idée.</p>
<h3>Mon projet</h3>
<p>Après quelques années de maturation et une étude de marché approfondie, je souhaite lancer mon activité dans le secteur du slowtourisme en septembre 2018. Il s'agira de courts et moyens séjours (en gîtes, chambres d'hôtes et hôtels indépendants) et de circuits individuels ou packagés, tout d'abord en région Ile de France et limitrophes, et pays de la Loire. Plus qu'un projet professionnel, c'est un projet de vie, porté par des valeurs fortes, telles que le respect de l'environnement, le développement de l'économie en zone rurale, l'authenticité et le partage.</p>
<p><u>Les atouts de mon offre</u></p>
<ul>
<li>hébergement et accueil par des acteurs locaux,</li>
<li>circuits en étoile, livrables en plusieurs formats,</li>
<li>assurance de découvrir le patrimoine régional d'intérêt,</li>
<li>possibilité de vivre des aventures au gré de ses envies.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Défis à relever</u></p>
<p>Atteindre un tel objectif est un réel défi. Le marché du tourisme en France est certes non délocalisable, mais les acteurs y sont nombreux ; je dois réussir à me démarquer, à me faire rapidement connaitre et à répondre positivement à la demande, sans pour autant renier mes valeurs.</p>
<p>Mon parcours professionnel m'a appris la prudence, et ma personnalité me porte à créer, organiser, mettre en oeuvre. A 50 ans passés, j'aspire plus que tout à vivre une vie qui me ressemble, tant personnelle que professionnelle. Sans votre aide, mon projet a peu de chance d'aboutir, mais avec vous, il a de forte chance de connaitre le succès. Alors... je compte sur vous !</p>
<h3>A quoi servira la collecte ?</h3>
<p>Pour lancer cette activité, j'ai besoin de financer la refonte totale de mon site et surtout, d'assurer rapidement son référencement sur le web. Cette étape est fondamentale pour la commercialisation de mes produits. Elle est donc décisive pour assurer le développement et la pérennité de mon activité.</p>

<p><strong>Who am I ?</strong></p>
<p>Like Nathalie celebrated by Gilbert Bécaud in 1962, I was undoubtedly predestined to guide people to discover the local heritage. Indeed, curious by nature, I have always searched for unknown treasures to enhance my sporting outings in the wilderness. And it is quite naturally that from 2005, I wanted to share my cultural and sporting adventures with friends.</p>
<p>In 2008, I took a step forward by guiding groups, on foot and by bike, to allow them to practice their favourite activity while discovering the Paris region, far from the crowd. And the most faithful of them gave me the idea of professionalizing this activity in 2012. My professional experiences having confirmed my administrative and commercial skills, remained to concretize the idea.</p>
<p><strong>My project</strong></p>
<p>After a few years of maturation and an in-depth market study, I wish to launch my business in the slowtourism sector in September 2018. These will be short and medium stays (in seasonal rental, guest rooms and independent hotels) and individual or packaged tours, first of all in the Ile de France and neighbouring regions, and Loire valley or Burgondy. More than a professional project, it is a life project, driven by strong values, such as respect for the environment, economical development in rural areas, authenticity and sharing.</p>
<p><u>Assets of my offer</u></p>
<ul>
<li>accommodation and reception by local actors,</li>
<li>circuits organized around lodging, available in several formats,</li>
<li>insurance to discover the regional heritage of interest,</li>
<li>possibility to live adventures according to your desires.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Challenges ahead</u></p>
<p>Achieving such a goal is a real challenge. French tourism market is certainly important, but the actors are numerous there. So I must succeed in distinguishing my offer, to help my customers to find it easily and to respond positively to the demand, without denying my values.</p>
<p>My professional background has taught me caution, and my personality leads me to create, organize, implement. At 50 years old, I aspire more than anything to live a life that resembles me, both personal and professional. Without your help, my project has little chance of success, but with you, it has a strong chance of success. So... I'm counting on you!</p>

<h3>Short Summary<br/> </h3>
<p>I’m in the process of setting up accommodation for backpackers and travelers, furnished and decorated using <strong>recycled and donated materials</strong>. There is far too much waste in the world and it’s my goal to draw attention to this issue and reduce waste! I also want to create a home-base for travelers to explore the amazing city of Jumunjin, South Korea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Until we get fully operational, we need help to keep maintaining funding. By donating, you’ll not only be contributing to a worthy cause but reserving your bed for a future stay at Re-Do.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/><br/> </h3>
<p>Re-Do needs to exist for two reasons: to help raise awareness about the environment and waste in Korea and worldwide, and to provide travelers in the Jumunjin area a home-base to explore since accommodations for international travelers are super limited here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After several years of travelling, I was shocked to see the amount of avoidable waste that occurs in seemingly every country on Earth. All over the world, people take unwanted but otherwise functional items and doom them to a life in landfill where they will sit, sometimes for centuries. But nowhere is this problem more visible than in Korea where any waste is left by the roadside for all to see before being collected a few days per week. Walking down any street will see you stroll past tables, sofas, old style TVs, suitcases, and parasols. All slightly broken, damaged or faded but completely repairable and beautiful in their own way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My vision is to draw attention to this wasteful system and to help in reducing the amount of unwanted items which are destined to sit in landfill, whilst providing fun and affordable accommodation to backpackers and travelers from around the world.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Jumunjin the small fishing town of South Korea at the east coast</strong></p>
<p>The Re-Do project’s first establishment is located in the stunningly beautiful seaside town of Jumunjin, with the hostel itself directly overlooking the East Sea. Jumunjin is known for its beautiful beaches and traditional fish market. Take a stroll through the streets with the smell of sea salt filling the air. Merchants sell the latest and tastiest catch of the day and you can stop in for a perfectly crafted coffee in Korea’s most famous region for exquisitely crafted beverages.</p>
<p>If that isn’t quite your speed, take a dip in the East Sea from Jumunjin’s divine white sand beach. Or, hop on a bus to the Odaesan national park (less than one hour away) where during summer you can hike through pristine forest littered with temples and waterfalls. In the winter, same national park contains the town of PyeongChang, home of the 2018 Winter Olympics. Grab your ski’s and hit the slopes!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </p>
<p><strong>Traveler's Art Project</strong></p>
<p>We’re also decorating the hostel with hand-made art, all created by our wonderful volunteers. The art they design will stock our art store and everything is made from recycled materials found or donated in the community.  When an artist makes a piece, it will decorate the hostel until someone comes along who wants to buy it. Then the money made from the art will go back toward the artist, wherever they are in the world.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540228378/js73ah9tkziot1gb9yqc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>So far, the project is going well, but like all new businesses there are growing pains which are putting it in danger of failure.

<li>Building maintenance costs</li>
<li>Food stuffs (to keep our volunteers happy and healthy)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>By donating to our project, your funding doesn’t just get lost in the system. You will be, in effect, reserving your bed for a future trip to the Re-Do project. Any sized donation is greatly appreciated, however any donation of $25 USD reserves you a night in the Re-Do hostel for any point in the future. Are you planning a trip to Korea in one, two, even TEN years? Reserve your bed now whilst helping out a worthy cause in the process. Thanks in advance for all your help, and I can’t wait to see you in Jumunjin!<br/> </p>

<h3>About the Inn</h3>
<p>Over the past few years, my partner and I have traveled to several different countries. During these trips, we discovered that the most special and unique experiences were brought on by staying in smaller, independent accommodations. </p>
<p>Which is how my dream of opening a bed and breakfast came to be.</p>
<p>The Storybook Inn combines my passions for reading, hospitality, and dogs. I anticipate operations to begin on April 1st, 2020. My plan is to renovate a historic home located in Minneapolis or St. Paul. We will provide high-quality accommodation and full breakfast for both tourist and business customers alike. Accommodations will consist of five to seven dog-friendly, comfortably-furnished rooms, each with queen-sized beds. Full breakfast will be served.</p>
<p>The region in and around the Twin Cities has beautiful scenery, numerous places of interest, dog parks, and activities. Guests will have many opportunities to enjoy themselves in this area that is well-suited for getaway holidays.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am seeking funds to assist with property purchase, renovations, furnishings, and initial operating costs. If I don't reach my entire goal, the funds will still go toward the inn, as any amount will help! Different perks of the contributors are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mention on the website</li>
<li>A paw-trait of your pup on the wall</li>
<li>A one-night complimentary stay</li>
<li>A complimentary massage from our contracted massage therapist</li>
<li>A five-day daycare pass</li>
<li>A $400.00 gift certificate from The Storybook Inn</li>
<li>A weekend retreat</li>
</ul>
<h3>Perks for the Pups</h3>
<p>The Storybook Inn won't stop at simply being dog-friendly. My plans also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An elegant wash station for owners to use any time they please</li>
<li>A large fenced-in yard</li>
<li>A small daycare area where owners may leave their fur children while they're exploring the Twin Cities</li>
<li>Concierge service for any pup crated in the guest suite </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not only will The Storybook Inn offer comfort to those traveling with pets—for whom options are often limited—but as my partner and I are both avid fosters, we would like to donate a small percentage of our profits toward Spot's Last Stop, a 501(c)(3) non-profit canine rescue located in the Twin Cities. This rescue matches local families with homeless canines in need of forever homes by following an adoption process that is easy and fair to adopt a homeless dog in need.</p>
<h3>What Else You Can Do</h3>
<p>Please help spread the word and share this campaign with your friends, family, and other like-minded small business lovers. And remember, as long as we have dogs by our side… anything is paw-sible!​</p>

To achieve the level of precision needed to meet our high quality and engineering standards we use a complex manufacturing process. Below we detail out all the steps the tool goes through to be transformed from raw titanium into the EverRatchet Clip: Wire Electrical Discharge Manufacturing (EDM) - A high-precision robot moves an electrified wire electrode about the diameter of a human hair through several sheets of titanium which causes the surrounding metal to vaporize leaving a cut in the metal. The path is takes is specified by the engineering models and drawings. This process is used to cut the outline of the tool body, to cut the interior static ¼” driver and dynamic driver areas.  Then the tool is repositioned on its side to cut the box opener/score tool.Sinker EDM -  To create the side catches we added second EDM process. A high-precision robot pulses an electrified pad into inner wall of the tool. This vaporizes the metal under the cut-out for the side catches to create the space for the bit to be secured under the catch. The position and depth of the feature is specified by the engineering models and drawings. Tumbling -  The tools are then placed in a vibrating bowl filled with deburring media to remove the sharp edges on metal parts. Blasting - Next, a machine applies our special glass blast finish. This process is used to apply the surface finish to the tool. EverRatchet Clip will be featuring our latest glass applied finish to keep it nice and new every time you reach for it.Lasering -  Finally, a CNC gantry laser etches graphics on to the tool. This process is used to apply the EverRatchet Clip name and functional markings to the toolAssembly/Packaging - We do a final inspection prior to packaging the unit with a blister-packaging machine.The Final ResultLeft: Current Shipping EverRatchet in PackagingRight: EverRatchet Clip in Proposed Packaging. Plastic will be updated to contour the EverRatchet Clip tool and cardboard surround will be professionally printed. Featured OnPRESS/MEDIA KIT Comments on Past Campaign ManagementWe know that there are certain concerns around transparency, communication, and delivering on crowdfunding campaigns.

Crowdfunding rocks; you know that and so do we. We’ve seen some fantastic products launched with crowdfunding, resulting in happier customers and developers. What could go wrong? Well, there’s delivery delays, products not living up to their design renderings, shipping fails, and so much more. We don’t want you to worry about any of that, which is why we’re guaranteeing to ship out all product out by November 1, 2019, or we give you a full refund. If you don’t receive a tracking number by that date, we will automatically file a refund to your account. Yes, really.Now here’s where you come in.Our direct-to-consumer model allows us to keep costs down, but we can’t go to production without your help. Whether you’re ready to pre-order now (and score the best price) or want to give us a thumbs up, you're helping to make luggage great and travel fun again. Ready to roll?Awesome. Scroll down for even more details and available projects rewards. In the meantime, we want to share a bit more about who we are and what led us to create Optimus.The Story of Optimus.The internet has changed the way everything around us is sold, from pizza to properties to eyeglasses and beyond, so isn't it time that luggage got the 21st century upgrade, too? This is why we decided to step in. Consumers like you are still expected to pay for expensive storefronts, tremendous sales force and mega advertising campaigns, only to receive a sub-par product at best. We’re going to change that, why not join us? We are a small team of industry veterans working directly with the best factories in the world, using the best materials to bring you high-quality luggage at a price you won’t believe. Our direct-to-consumer model allows us to keep costs down and pass the savings directly onto you, where it belongs.The Making of OptimusIt all started with a few simple sketches.Then our designers mocked up 3D CAD drawings and we knew we were onto something good.So, our manufacturers get to work. First step, creating the shell mold.From there, we move onto refining the details of The Optimus. Here’s a glimpse of our interior lining.And then we start pulling it all together. The most important part? Our Hinomoto wheels, of course.Then we test, test, test…and test some more.Meet the finished product: The OPTIMUS.  Let’s refresh.Why should you support Optimus?

I am a business owner operator, a Kiwi who has been living in Aus for more than 10 years now. I am very concerned with the plight of Kiwi's in Aus. When trans Tasman relationships fail for Kiwi's, Australia leaves severe failings in social security entitlements, the children of these families will suffer. Nobody should have to live on the streets because of domestic abuse and the inability of Australia to respect the trans Tasman/ANZAC agreement. 
 Since 2001 legislation has discriminated against Kiwis residing in Australia. Contributions to this cause will help NZ expats suffering financial hardship in Australia find a way home.  Since 2001 NZ'ers are refused any right to citizenship, social security, domestic abuse protection, disability pension or education funding. Ever. Much misinformation about this issue has been and continues to be paraded in the media.   What We Need & What You Get This is about looking after our Whanau in Australia and offering a way home to those who cannot otherwise afford it.  This is a huge problem with more than 680,000 Kiwi's in Oz. Over 150,000 Kiwi's will never have any social security rights in Australia.
These funds will be designated to helping Kiwi's find a way home and avoid a life of abuse and of living on the the streets in Austalia because of the draconian legislation passed against Kiwi's by the government of Australia in 2001.    The Impact Your contribution will help those Kiwis who find themselves destitute, desperate and who cannot access a pension in Australia, by providing them a way back to NZ in times of hardship.

I got the idea to build FreakyCheap.com (under construction) because an active e-buyer and seller I was always looking for
best deals online; of course only from trustworthy sites like eBay, Amazon or Overstock
etc… but I couldn't find a descent website where I can compare prices from these guys only, that's why I decided to build it.

                                     

How it works.
Who’s going
to be the cheapest?  Let’s find out. 
Open this provisional link http://miguel.kr.cisinlive.com/ , 
Type your product on the search bar
and hit the search button, our search engine will craw Ebay and Amazon’s
servers to pull out the info you are searching for, 
pick the cheapest and buy
it if you want :))



Why we need your support?
We are
seeking $100,000 to give the best user experience and that is very expensive and hard to
accomplish but not impossible.
Speed:
One of the
first and main issues that we need to attack is speed, users has 0 tolerance
with slow websites and having this issue is not an option for us.
Accuracy:
Accuracy is
another main factor here, so there’s no an option to give irrelevant results.
Re-Design:
We might
need to redesign the entire store to make it simple but beautiful, user
friendly and responsive.
App:
We are going
to build our own free app to do the same thing from your smartphone.
Marketing
Campaign:
We are going
to run a full online marketing campaign necessary to earn brand awareness.
   What you get.

Benefits for users:


Find best deals quick and easier.


No
more waste of time searching on different stores.


Hassle
free.

No
annoying sign ups.

FAQs:

· 
Where can I try how FreakyCheap.com works ?
Here: http://miguel.kr.cisinlive.com/
· 
Why only Ebay and Amazon?
Since is hard to find another e-store who can beat these guys, there’s no
make sense to add another competitor so far. We are considering to add other
important online stores in the phase3.
· 
Why is taking too much time to show
the results?
This is one of the main issues that we need to fix in these phase 2 to
give a better user experience.
· 
Is it only for new products?
Yes it is for now, FC will only compare prices of brand new products from
Ebay vs Amazon, but we will compare used products soon.  
· 
What about auctions?
Amazon doesn’t have auctions so FC cannot compare in this category.
· 
How FC will earn money?
3 ways:
- 
Affiliate
program with Ebay and Amazon.
- 
Google
AdSense.
- 
Sponsor
Ads.

Risks & Challenges Risks:
We are subject to eBay's and Amazon's policies, so right now are favorable for our business model but we cannot control what decisions they are gonna make in the future.
Challenges: 
Deliver faster and accuracy results are the key for success.

""Delivery of rewards/perks are subject to best efforts and are not guaranteed."" We are very confidence that if we can deliver an excellent user experience a huge success will follows; but this success won’t come without your support, and that’s why we are going to honor our deal with those who believe in us from the very beginning.“Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be”.Job 8:7",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">After completing my B.F.A in photography, I was awarded the Listhus artist residency in Óafsfjörður, Iceland. The residency will be a 6 week program that allows for me to work solely on my photography. I proposed to create a new project working in the isolated dark winter photographing the landscape, creating sound art, and making a short documentary from interviewing residents. Ólafsjörður is located in Northeast Iceland, between a couple of fjords (mountains formed by glacial erosion.) The residency will be from October 17  - November 30 this year. My husband, Chris, will be joining me since he is my assistant and 7 weeks away from him is way too long!</span></h3>

About:
After completing my B.F.A in photography, I was awarded the Listhus artist residency in Óafsfjörður, Iceland. The residency will be a 6 week program that allows for me to work solely on my photography. I proposed to create a new project working in the isolated dark winter photographing the landscape, creating sound art, and making a short documentary from interviewing residents. Ólafsjörður is located in Northeast Iceland, between a couple of fjords (mountains formed by glacial erosion.) The residency will be from October 17  - November 30 this year. My husband, Chris, will be joining me since he is my assistant and 7 weeks away from him is way too long!


Our trip:





To make the airfares cheaper and to break up the flight time, we have decided to fly to Brooklyn, NY October 6th - 11th and stay with friends. On the 11th, we will head to Reykjavik, Iceland and tour the country (exploring and creating work outside of the residency) until the 17th. Then we will be off to North Iceland by bus! From then on we will be in a tiny apartment and share a bathroom without a kitchen until November 30th. It's quite the challenge but we are so ready for it!
During our stay we hope to connect with artists and the community. We will interview many residents about the landscape and their stories. The landscape can be beautiful on its own, but the story behind it is far more compelling and worth sharing. 


Finances:
At this point, I think it is important to communicate the reason why we are seeking your assistance. Initially, the terms of the residency would have awarded me more financial support, however; due to funding restrictions, I agreed to accept their proposal that offered less funding, leaving Chris and I to cover a majority of the trip's financial requirements. Despite this obstacle, I feel the opportunity to work in a foreign country, and to have my art showcased in an international exhibition is worth all of our efforts. So I am asking for help to fund this project and my career path. Chris and I have been working so hard to save for this opportunity. We moved out of our apartment and now live with family to help and we can't wait to go on this adventure!Your funding will go towards:
Airfare
Camera Equipment
Audio Equipment
Rent during our stay
Food 
Car rental
Tours (to find the perfect composition)
Bus fares
Exhibition costs (printing + framing)

<h3>What and Why?!?!</h3>
<p>The $1200 raised will go directly into traveling (mostly commuting, places to rest and resources for projects during and after the trip). My goal is to reach the country from my own investment, yet contributions will help me to balance moving around and then head outward.  I am aiming for 2.5 total weeks this round. I am grateful for anything I receive financially, and new projects within photography, music, education and even food will be created from this campaign.</p>
<p>This is an experience of cultural exchange; I have roots within Ethiopia and am not going for just myself, I also want to tap into the music and art communities there, to further establish a bridge/connection within my communities within the USA and other parts of the world, that I've already established with little to no resources. This is a big picture excursion. I will also be incorporating elements from my super recent trip to Morocco, which is a superb country in its own right! Morocco gave me new insight and strength to go even deeper into the motherland. I've also visited Nigeria when I was younger with family, I have roots there as well, I'm very curious and excited to reach and embrace Africa from the OPPOSITE side.</p>
<p>I am eager to establish a strong bond with my people in Ethiopia and present new ideas, art, music and other elements of culture to others worldwide. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This Abyssinia excursion is a powerful one to me, because it will be during the time I was born on this planet (March 24th) and is a pilgrimage/return to my and family origins. I have a strong deep inner bond to Ethiopia, for the food, music, embrace of the people no matter which city I encounter them within, my connection to Rastafari spirituality and lifestyle via Haile Selassie, Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley and more toward repatriation and Pan Africanism. </p>
<p>Art, music and food I feel are the strongest ways to break the chains of oppression collectively. I want to introduce those in my journey, to what I've learned and how I create, and see if there is a way to incorporate that for the youth both in Ethiopia and within the USA as well. We are one people collectively, and all of our origins, one way or another are rooted within these lands.</p>

</div><p style=""text-align: right;""> </p><p style=""text-align: right;""> </p><p style=""text-align: right;""> </p></div>","The SkyWing(from Concept to Prototype) The SkyWing results from many years of personal aeronautical studies, infinite sketches and a powerful belief that the human can fly. It will be a custom-made suit composed of Dracon (sailcloth) and two lightweight profiles 3D printed in Carbon Fibre on each arm. These extensions plus the entire area of the body creates a surface that allows the user to generate enough lift to take off! With your support, not only I could keep working to the next stage, but we may improve it! Please let me introduce you to my idea and also my dream!  3D of myself with the two profiles and the extension of the fabric. Note the long zipper on the chest, lets the user fit in easily  A long time ago...I had two car accidents that almost killed me; by coincidence, three days before the anniversary of the first accident I had the second one. I am certain God and The Universe send me those experiences to change how I was living, I definitely did!The last recovery made me start to think cars are not safe at all. Indeed, I could not even have a ride for a while. Such a scary feeling which went away a long time ago. Sparked my mind!After that realisation which was around 1995, it started my journey of knowledge, my non-stop daydreaming and the origin of a great story to tell to my grandchildren.              “He who has overcome his fears will truly be free”Aristotle My first attemptWas naive, bold and funny! I made a balsa wood model with plastic wrap. Yes, I did not know what I was thinking to be honest!The influence of the design was the structure of the fingers of bats. It had five curved beams joined on each hand and the plastic all the way-up between the elements. When I finished the project, I walked to the closest hill on a very windy day, and then I opened my arms. The wind blew me away making me fall into a bush full of thorns! A few days after the silly accident I changed the remains in a new configuration, this time similar to the dragonfly’s wings. Of course, it did not work! Above, I sketched the three models back in 1998. Note, that the first model I had to recreate in this drawing, it is the one at the back from that one I made the far on the left.  By that moment, I started reading the bible for pilots Van Sickle’s Modern Airmanship. My approach was more conventional. I decide a bird shape with internal fixed sections, same as we build aeroplanes. It was very rigid and heavy.I used micro-corrugated cardboard. I painted in black and white, the darker side on top which makes the air hotter and sucks it up into the air. Imagine a humongous condor, but with less graceless. I grabbed my invention, and I walked to a hillside... Long story short, I failed! “Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born.”Nikola Tesla​ Life goes onAfter that failure, anything was more important than my dream, parties, birthdays, movies, endless activities… Then, I decided that I have to fulfil my destiny. I stepped back; I took a better approach to recap the project. It was a good decision made by God and the Universe that put me in an English spoken country.I bought a couple of books on aeronautics. I studied and I understood all available concepts along with formulas for designing a wing. This knowledge changed everything!On these two pages are the three well-known formulas for wing design.I ended up making a rationalisation between the formulas and concepts which let  me decide the size of the wing, Top right square.  And onOnce, I had an idea of a suit that looks like Flying squirrels... I did nothing about it, and many years after they invented the Flying Suit! I freaked out! I did not want to see my project made by another person. But later on, I found out that the inventor worked for over 10 years before succeeding with his invention, and he gave me a lot of hope! Idea from 1999, on the same year the inventors of the Flyingsuit were showing their invention in a Skydiver Convention!  Finally, I found my pathTo be sincere I do not know if I am making history. If not, at least I am making my own story, whichever is, is great! Right? One day I was showing and explaining my idea to my wife, she already knew that I have been working for many years without much advanced, and she said: “That looks good but when you will be going to make it?”. Then I realised that she was right!I was wasting my time and I did not want to feel the same feeling that I had when someone else had the same idea, it worked on it and achieved it! Ideas are all over the world! Sketch. 2016 I put myself on track again. I researched the alternatives in materials and also how to get this invention out for everyone that wants to fly and feel the freedom of being in the air!I redesign the whole SkyWing, I went to the basic of all shapes. Since I was little, I loved dinosaurs; then, one day I came up with the idea of a similar shape.The Quetzalcoatlus was the biggest and heaviest of all animals that could fly in our planet, with 250 kg of weight and 10 m of wingspan it was able to fly across the sky. Exploring the design of the entire suit 2019 I extrapolate the same concept that Pterodactyls used to fly which was using their elongated pinky finger to hold a thin membrane of skin (called Brachiopatagium) then I came with the first rational design that might let the human fly.In the future, we might use SkyWings to commute to work or even travelling to other countries. Thank you to everybody supports I can dedicate my entire time and energy to this dream.  “You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you”.James Allen Jump or not to jumpThe reason that makes me jump into this amazing crowdfunding website. Is that I shall raise capital to make this venture happen and I will give The SkyWing to the world in return! But before, I was very protective of my idea, just a few of my friends and family knew about this novelty; is because I already read too many stories about inventors or even architects that left our world in poverty after people without moral values stole their grand designs; others copied their products and made the founders lead to bankruptcy.One thing is straightforward to me, doing this by myself all alone it will get me too much time, money and energy. Please join me on this quest and we build this together! Printing off  the right-side profile on a 1:1 scale from The Blackbelt 3D printer  Different scales and models of the profile from the right side To create the profile of the wings, I previously bought the only 3D printer that can print continually in a straight line. The Blackbelt from https://standardprintco.com allows me re-model before the final design in one to one scale.  “Throw your heart over the bar and your body will follow.”Norman Vincent Peale What I need to doAt the moment I am printing the 3D models in the Blackbelt, but I require to print them at 1:1 scale. I have to test tension and compression. I am using PLA filament which is a non-structural material at all, but sooner, I need to implement carbon fibre, which is stronger than steel and is lighter than fibreglass. This is my creative corner at home!  After testing and improving the structure. I need to buy a sewing machine and put together the suit, after the next learning curve...  I must try it! “Set a goal that's meaningful and compelling enough, and your skills, your knowledge and your effectiveness will expand in order to reach that goal.”  Less Brown Where all the founded money will goAt this stage, there is no crew… Indeed! My lovely family, but besides them is essential a squad of professionals to encourage me out to push further!With these funds I will consult and adopt other professional skills to build the SkyWing:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are all dependent on power. Often times we want to take some with us. Generators are <u>clunky</u>, USB Power Banks simply don't <u>provide enough</u>, and battery-based Power Stations are simply <u>too heavy</u>. </p>
<p>Our goal is to provide a significant amount of energy (400Whr) without any unnecessary weight or size. As a bonus of our technology, the MicroRaptor 400 is also completely silent and splash-proof!</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us begin mass-producing the MR400 and provide powerful, yet small Power Stations around the United States and the world! </p>
<p>The developed technology is a stepping stone to next-generation power grids that will be based on DC voltage, which is proven to be more efficient and reliable than existing AC-based power grids.</p>
<p>Yellow Power Systems is funded by Anton Bakker, a veteran in the Power Electronics Industry with over 25 years of experience in IC Design and Production. Anton holds a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Delft University in the Netherlands. </p>
<p>Judith Bakker is our head of Marketing and Sales and she is pursuing a BSc degree in Aerospace Engineering at San Jose State University.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your funds will kick start production of the MR400, which is the world's first High-Voltage (120V) DC-based Power Station. Prototypes of the MR400 are currently being beta-tested and the goal of this campaign is to produce 50-100 products to gauge user experience with this new concept that could define future microgrids. </p>
<p>Our technology enables the removal of inefficient DC-AC converters and cooling. Resulting in lower weight, smaller size, and higher efficiency. To give you a few numbers: The MR400 is half the weight and half the size of its closest competitor of similar power capacity, while at the same time being 15 times more efficient! (The MR400 has an efficiency of 99%, while competitors are typically at 85%)</p>
<p>If you decide to fund us, you will receive an MR400 with a 20% rebate and up to $100 in accessories that we have carefully selected for you that work perfectly with our technology.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Renewable energy is the way to go for a better future in this world. All engineers and scientists agree that homes and microgrids should be based on DC instead of AC. By funding us or buying our Power Station you will contribute to a better environment, while at the same time own a piece of equipment that is twice as good as anything else that is on the market today. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The MR400 development has taken 4 years and is on its fifth prototype and has been proven functional and useful by a handful of users and beta testers. It is now ready for mass production and we believe it is ready to be shown to a bigger audience.  We use high-quality, original Samsung 35-E batteries that are used in numerous e-bikes that are mass-produced in the USA. </p>
<p>We also give a 1-year replacement and a 5-year life-time warranty on this first batch of our product.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The best way to help is to fund us by buying an MR400. However, if you don't have the funds available, you can also support us by spreading the word and informing your friends who might be interested in owning this piece of equipment! It is a lifesaver during a blackout, a great upgrade for a camping trip, and a perfect tool for professional use when no electricity is readily available.</p>

The developed technology is a stepping stone to next-generation power grids that will be based on DC voltage, which is proven to be more efficient and reliable than existing AC-based power grids.
Yellow Power Systems is funded by Anton Bakker, a veteran in the Power Electronics Industry with over 25 years of experience in IC Design and Production. Anton holds a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Delft University in the Netherlands. 
Judith Bakker is our head of Marketing and Sales and she is pursuing a BSc degree in Aerospace Engineering at San Jose State University.
 

What We Need & What You Get
Your funds will kick start production of the MR400, which is the world's first High-Voltage (120V) DC-based Power Station. Prototypes of the MR400 are currently being beta-tested and the goal of this campaign is to produce 50-100 products to gauge user experience with this new concept that could define future microgrids. 
Our technology enables the removal of inefficient DC-AC converters and cooling. Resulting in lower weight, smaller size, and higher efficiency. To give you a few numbers: The MR400 is half the weight and half the size of its closest competitor of similar power capacity, while at the same time being 15 times more efficient! (The MR400 has an efficiency of 99%, while competitors are typically at 85%)
If you decide to fund us, you will receive an MR400 with a 20% rebate and up to $100 in accessories that we have carefully selected for you that work perfectly with our technology.
 

The Impact
Renewable energy is the way to go for a better future in this world. All engineers and scientists agree that homes and microgrids should be based on DC instead of AC. By funding us or buying our Power Station you will contribute to a better environment, while at the same time own a piece of equipment that is twice as good as anything else that is on the market today. 
 

Risks & Challenges
The MR400 development has taken 4 years and is on its fifth prototype and has been proven functional and useful by a handful of users and beta testers. It is now ready for mass production and we believe it is ready to be shown to a bigger audience.  We use high-quality, original Samsung 35-E batteries that are used in numerous e-bikes that are mass-produced in the USA. 
We also give a 1-year replacement and a 5-year life-time warranty on this first batch of our product.  

Other Ways You Can Help
The best way to help is to fund us by buying an MR400. However, if you don't have the funds available, you can also support us by spreading the word and informing your friends who might be interested in owning this piece of equipment! It is a lifesaver during a blackout, a great upgrade for a camping trip, and a perfect tool for professional use when no electricity is readily available.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>ParaBatur Modular Water Storage System</h3>
<p>Patents Pending!!! <a href=""http://www.parabatur.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ParaBatur.com</a></p>
<p>Hi, I'm Gavin, Founder and Proprietor of ParaBatur LLC.</p>
<p>I'm a US Navy and Marine Corps Veteran that has traveled to every continent (except Antarctica), and lived on three. I've never really worried about manmade or natural disasters before I became a father. I never considered trading in my ""lone wolf"" credentials for a reliance on neighbors, until I completed my Masters in Resilient Communities. And I certainly never thought about preparing in terms of water, food, and medicine, with a perspective on young children or the elderly.</p>
<p>This is the founding principle and drive of ParaBatur: blend ""preparation"" with mainstream needs and customers.</p>
<p>Our first project, the Modular Water Storage System, is inspired by my father preparing for a hurricane by stocking up on thin, plastic, one-gallon water jugs from a ""big box"" store. ""Why so many small jugs,"" I asked.</p>
<p>""I'm 76 years-old, dumb ass...how many 5 gallon jugs do you think I can carry?"" was his reply. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Next Step</h3>
<p>ParaBatur is working with a cutting edge design and engineering firm that helps develop not only the best product, but also one ready for large-scale production. Additionally, the firm can produce the first run, in-house, allowing for complete vertical integration of the process. And...allowing for the entire system to Made in the USA!</p>
<p>After several Covid conference calls, the owner provided me with a quote (attached below).</p>
<p>I've included a copy in the spirit of transparency and to better explain the monetary goal: ~$14,000 from 3D model to rapid prototype, $1,000 for cost overrun, and $5,000 to produce the first run of the Modular Water Storage System.</p>

<h3>Initial Design and Inspiration</h3>
<p>The design process started with a number of sketches in order to play with the idea of nesting crates for stacking large amounts of water; however, also creating a way for the easy use of small amounts during an emergency, while camping, or a day at the soccer fields.</p>
<p>Additionally, the large mouth allows for long-term storage of dry, bulk foods, oils, and dehydrated/freeze-dried foods (recommend adding food-grade silica packets).</p>
<p>Finally, I handed over my drafting sketches to a CAD friend in order to create easier-to-read 2D models (see below). </p>
<p>With these in hand, I reached out to a Swedish engineer who owns and runs his own industrial design and engineering firm. After hashing out my goals for the project, he excitedly jumped onboard and is patiently waiting to start.</p>
<p>The exterior crate, will be fashioned from a highly durable polymer; the primary functions being to hold the water modules and protect them for the elements.</p>
<p>The interior modules will be fashioned from a pba-free polymer and nest within the protective crate.</p>
<p>I've also included a 3D representation showing the bottom of the Module Jug; as you can see the lip will nest inside the recess on top of another jug. The crate also has this integrated feature.</p>

You will be online in 132 countries with fast LTE data and relevant plans. We do also have wi-fi hotspot coverage in 160 countries globally. Wifi Optimization - Nommi’s unique dual wifi feature saves your cellular data by seamlessly connecting your device to public wifi networks. It also provides a separate guest wifi network that you can share with family and friends. Lastly, it serves a wifi range extender so you can enjoy wifi in a cozier part of your home.Smart Charging - Nommi's Power version allows you to charge your phone using its Qi Wireless charger by simply placing your device directly onto the charging pad. No more wall chargers, adaptors or USB ports when you're on the go. It's compatible with all Qi-certified devices so ""shoot, my phone battery is dying"" syndrome is replaced with a full charge and more online time.       Nommi is the world's first hybrid device that provides a new kind of connectivity experience in one sleek and portable design. No need to hassle with SIM cards, carry old-fashioned personal hotspot devices or remember to bring your powerbank. To get online, all you have to do is activate a data plan via the app.       Traveling is exciting, but often stressful having to worry about data vs. wifi coverage, roaming fees, and whether or not you’ll be able to contact friends or family. Nommi was designed to solve these added stresses, so there’s little to no change in how you move, communicate, or search in your everyday life.   Nommi offers high quality, global connection for all travel lovers.While traveling, Nommi allows you to focus on the ‘travel’ part. Nommi acts as a wireless hotspot for all your devices in over 132 countries. This means wherever you are traveling, you can stop stressing about buying, activating, or inserting SIM cards. Of course, if you already have your favorite data plan from a local operator, feel free to use your SIM. Simply insert it into the micro slot on the side of Nommi like you would on an iPhone.The easier way is to use a data package via the app and ditch the SIM. That’s right, as soon as you land you can post your selfie from the plane, email your boss or text your Mom with zero lapse in connection!   Customize your Data - Nommi’s user friendly app makes it easy to update and keep track of your usage.With the Nommi app, you can easily access and manage your device from your smartphone.You will be online in 132 countries with fast LTE data and relevant plans. We do also have wi-fi hotspot coverage in 160 countries globally.    Prevent unauthorized access to your network and conceal personal data.By default, Nommi is configured to automatically encrypt all your data through secure servers when you connect to public wifi networks. Although VPN brings extra security, it can make connections slower, so feel free to disable it via the app for the networks you trust.     Making the most of your networks - Nommi only offers the best wifi connection for fast downloading and browsing. Data is expensive and constantly searching for a local wifi network is exhausting. With Nommi, you’ll never miss out on a strong wifi connection speed and the best part is, you’re simultaneously saving money and data.  Nommi gives you unlimited access to it's worldwide Wi-Fi database and tests surrounding wifi networks before taking you off 4G. Nommi’s dual-wifi feature is on by default and constantly scans available wifi networks as a background process. When it finds a quality wifi network, it will check to see if our crowdsourced password database contains a password for it. If a password matches, Nommi will try to connect, testing the speed of the network without interrupting your current cellular connection. Once everything checks out, Nommi initializes VPN over the network, tests it one more time and only then starts to route your traffic over public wifi. Ultimately this feature saves your cellular data allowance. As a Nommi user, not only do you have access to a large existing database of passwords, but you can also help curate this global database and share passwords with others by adding them via the app. Keep your personal network private but still share Nommi with friends.Similar to professional wifi routers, Nommi will provide two wifi networks (SSID) connections. The primary is your own private wifi network, secured by a strong password and encryption, to which you connect your own devices: laptop, ipad, smart watch, printer, etc. The secondary is a guest wifi network made specifically for your friends and colleagues. This guest wifi allows them to connect without password, but only after the app has notified you and asked for permission. Never again will you have to read the alphabet off the back of your router or spell out complex symbols for your visiting friends. When they are connected, they will be isolated from your primary private network space. Via the app, you’ll also be able to see who is currently connected and how much data they’ve used. Your long distance relationship solved - Nommi provides a wider reach for low signal areas.It’s fairly common to have low wifi signal depending on where your home router is located. Let’s say you get bad connection in your room because your router is downstairs. Nommi will automatically extend to the fastest available nearby network, doubling your wifi signal range. You can also specify which signal you want to extend to in the “Wi-fi Extender” section via the Nommi app. This feature is useful not only at home, but more importantly at hotels, where you only get good wifi signal near the door, because there’s 1 wifi router per floor. Leave Nommi halfway between you and the wired router location and enjoy strong wifi signal.       Nommi keeps up with the latest technology by combining power and connectivity in one device.No need to carry that old-fashioned personal hotspot device or a power bank any more. The Nommi Power version combines both. Place and charge - Remove the burden of disconnecting and inserting a charging cable every time you need you pick up your phone.Charge your phone using our Qi charger by simply placing your device directly onto the Nommi Power charging pad. Compatible with all Qi-enabled devices, there is no need to plug your device into a wall charger or USB port. It’s extremely convenient and avoids having to buy new USB cables every time your old one breaks. Qi wireless charging is supported by most Android flagship smartphones (Samsung Galaxy, Google Nexus and Pixel, etc) and Apple’s latest iPhone 8 and iPhone X models. Nommi’s strong battery is intended to keep your charge high over long periods of time.Nommi’s Slim version has a high performance 3500mAh battery that can deliver more than 16 hours of battery life when 4G/wifi sharing. Nommi’s Power version has a 10000mAh battery that can operate around 48 hours with 4G/wifi sharing. When using the wireless charging function on the Power version, the battery will last long enough to charge your iPhone twice and still work for 24 hours as a 4G/wifi sharing hotspot. Nommi is the perfect accessory for your next trip. Finally, the bulky, boring brick that we know as a Power Bank has been revamped to one sleek, portable design. Nommi is convenient and comfortable to hold in your hand and still flat enough to put your smartphone on it. Both the Slim and the Power version are lightweight and compact, designed to take up minimal space in your already packed suitcase, carry-on or purse.   Which model is right for you?               We both [Alyona and Kairat] love traveling. As soon as you exit the airport doors, you smell new scents, feel the temperature, and hear street sounds. You see what people look like, how they dress and know you’re about to have a new life experience. All the feels aside, we also like to stay hyper connected with easy access to our email and social media. It’s the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing we scroll through before bed. When the plane lands, we want to be connected instantly. Why wasn’t there a device that kept us connected abroad? Kairat and I met for the first time at an IT conference where we discussed this recurring issue and so, the idea of Nommi was born.   What about one that is equally useful at home to avoid multiple devices?We spent hours brainstorming the idea in cafes, with friends, even boring our relatives with talks of Nommi. Finally, we decided to start a business to figure out if we were the only ones with this problem.     We ended up learning there are plenty of people like us - people who are not satisfied with the current solutions, who don’t want to buy a monthly data plan when coming to a country for just 3 days, who want to pay just for what they use. We brought up a team around the concept and did tests for more than a year.   Now we’re here, launching our crowdfunding campaign with our first working prototype which you can check out live in action below:  For more detailed information on how to use Nommi, check out our educational videos below. We thank you for your support and are extremely excited to share Nommi with you!   7+ years of experience in corporate segment, with focus on eCom/digital. Works on popularizing of STEM among women.

Her style focuses on sensuality and minimalism.        How does Nommi work?It acts as usual personal hotspot (mifi), but without need to get new local sim card when you travel. Also it saves your data plan allowance by routing your traffic over wifi networks. The Power version has 10000 battery to provide power bank with with QI wireless charging. Do I have to buy a monthly subscription in order to use Nommi?No, not at all. Besides, if for any reason you don’t want that option, you can still insert your data sim card into the standard sim slot that Nommi has, or use Nommi only as dual wifi repeater and range extender (plus powerbank feature in Powerbank version). Please keep in mind, that if you've purchased Nommi via crowdfunding, we provide you with updated wifi passwords in our crowdsourced database free for life. In short, you can still get better wifi experience even without any subscription.What if I want to return the device? Your device has warranty policy and if there's anything broken/missing or there's other case indicated in the policy - please reach out to us on this.  Are there hidden extra/fees I should know about?No fees from our side. However, you may still want to keep your current phone SIM, especially for GSM phone calls and texts. Your current operator will still charge you, but you can lower your bill by switching to a smaller data plan. How does the Nommi Power wireless charging work?Charge your phone using built-in Qi charger by simply placing your device directly onto the Nommi charging pad. No need to plug your device into a wall charger or USB port. Compatible with all Qi-enabled devices. (iPhone 8 and X, Samsung S5-S8, Note 5-Note 8.

It will catch another network at 30-50 meters if no concrete walls between and interference (other closed wifis around) is not too much. For example, if your current home wifi router is on the 1st floor, covers the 2nd floor nicely but doesn’t work on the 3rd floor at all, then put Nommi at 2nd floor, it will cover 3rd floor nicely. Which 3G and 4G frequencies, bands and technologies device support?Support TD-LTE/LTE FDD/WCDMA/GSM;Bands: B1/B2/B3/B4/B7/B17/B20/B40/B41; 850/900/1900/2100; 850/900/1800/1900    How do I manage the device and data package from the mobile app? In the main menu of nommi mobile app you can see the data traffic consumption, data package, battery life and connected devices. How much will shipping cost?

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is BaseCamp</h2>
<p>Yes, one or two people can go off hammocking by themselves. But what of hammocking with <strong>ALL </strong>of your friends? Scoop up the dog! Invite the mailman! BaseCamp is a hammock experience for extroverts. String it up at a picnic! Bring it to the park! Fill it up at farmers markets, summer camps, beach parties, camping trips, anywhere that people gather and connect.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502178424/eciam5byw2bjrgp7k9tc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Problem</h3>
<p><strong>HOW'S THE WEATHER OVER THERE?</strong> ...it's not always possible to hang multiple hammocks close together.</p>
<p><strong>Get your feet off my face</strong> ...two people per hammock is limiting in a group and can be a bit too snug.</p>
<p><strong>Who brought the ratchet?</strong> ...platform hammocks and tents hold more people but are heavy, less portable, and require tools.</p>
<p><strong>The higher you hang the farther you fall</strong> ...Stacking hammocks can be inconvenient and dangerous.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502180619/hsvmstfdb3spnrxmx7rd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why BaseCamp is Awesome</strong></h2>
<p>Like beards, BIGGER is just BETTER when it comes to hammocking! You have more space. You can fit more people. BaseCamp only weighs as much as a box of wine (56oz) and is the size of a watermelon. Yet it holds 550lbs!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">You can fit...</h3>
<p><strong>3</strong> full grown burly men OR</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> recently reconciled opposing teammates of a beer pong tournament OR</p>
<p><strong>5 </strong>glittery girls with flowers in their hair OR</p>
<p><strong>6 </strong>middle school students and all of their angst OR</p>
<p><strong>Too many</strong> kindergartners!</p>

<h2><strong>Our Handmade Advantage</strong></h2>
</div>
<p>Our hammocking community is empowering women and their families in Northern Thailand. We are a small operation, employing a team of seamstresses making each hammock by hand from the comfort of their own homes. No mass factory manufacturing, no child labor, and no outsourcing...we operate completely in-house!</p>
<p>We focus on cottage-construction techniques rather than mass factory production. The result is superior craftsmanship and a ripple effect of positivity and empowerment. Good vibes from our community to yours! </p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502182954/mtnptk50q8kfc8okhjmu.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is Flying Squirrel Outfitters?</strong></h2>
<p>Flying Squirrel Outfitters is a small camping hammock manufacturer working to create positive social impact by helping the world relax!  </p>
<p>We operate in a small garment manufacturing village in Thailand where seamstresses generally work in factories that recognize minimum wage laws. However, some women are physically unable to work in factories or simply can’t leave home for 10+ hours each day. Some local garment manufacturers will hire stay-at-home seamstresses knowing they can pay exceptionally low wages almost unnoticed – sometimes paying as little as 8 cents per pair of pants sewn, well below Thailand's legal minimum.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJu7gljGXlE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""640""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Flying Squirrel Outfitters strives to break this cycle of limited opportunity by creating jobs that are sustainable, location and schedule flexible, and fairly compensated. At-home hammock making has become a growing source of income for our team of seamstresses and their families. As our company grows, we look forward to expanding these opportunities for more women in the village.</p>
<p>Rest easy in your hammock knowing that the hands that made it are thriving as a result of its creation.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Brian. Four years ago I quit my comfy job in Seattle, sold my stuff, and headed abroad seeking something new. While traveling, I fell in love with Chiang Mai, Thailand and decided to sink some roots. I began working with local seamstresses, making travel hammocks for tourists. What started as an idea became an experiment and grew into a passion project called Flying Squirrel Outfitters.</p>

</div></div>","What is BaseCamp
Yes, one or two people can go off hammocking by themselves. But what of hammocking with ALL of your friends? Scoop up the dog! Invite the mailman! BaseCamp is a hammock experience for extroverts. String it up at a picnic! Bring it to the park! Fill it up at farmers markets, summer camps, beach parties, camping trips, anywhere that people gather and connect.

The Problem
HOW'S THE WEATHER OVER THERE? ...it's not always possible to hang multiple hammocks close together.
Get your feet off my face ...two people per hammock is limiting in a group and can be a bit too snug.
Who brought the ratchet? ...platform hammocks and tents hold more people but are heavy, less portable, and require tools.
The higher you hang the farther you fall ...Stacking hammocks can be inconvenient and dangerous.  

Why BaseCamp is Awesome
Like beards, BIGGER is just BETTER when it comes to hammocking! You have more space. You can fit more people. BaseCamp only weighs as much as a box of wine (56oz) and is the size of a watermelon. Yet it holds 550lbs!
You can fit...
3 full grown burly men OR
4 recently reconciled opposing teammates of a beer pong tournament OR
5 glittery girls with flowers in their hair OR
6 middle school students and all of their angst OR
Too many kindergartners!




 
Our Handmade Advantage

Our hammocking community is empowering women and their families in Northern Thailand. We are a small operation, employing a team of seamstresses making each hammock by hand from the comfort of their own homes. No mass factory manufacturing, no child labor, and no outsourcing...we operate completely in-house!
We focus on cottage-construction techniques rather than mass factory production. The result is superior craftsmanship and a ripple effect of positivity and empowerment. Good vibes from our community to yours!

What Folks are Saying

What is Flying Squirrel Outfitters?
Flying Squirrel Outfitters is a small camping hammock manufacturer working to create positive social impact by helping the world relax!  
We operate in a small garment manufacturing village in Thailand where seamstresses generally work in factories that recognize minimum wage laws. However, some women are physically unable to work in factories or simply can’t leave home for 10+ hours each day. Some local garment manufacturers will hire stay-at-home seamstresses knowing they can pay exceptionally low wages almost unnoticed – sometimes paying as little as 8 cents per pair of pants sewn, well below Thailand's legal minimum.

Flying Squirrel Outfitters strives to break this cycle of limited opportunity by creating jobs that are sustainable, location and schedule flexible, and fairly compensated. At-home hammock making has become a growing source of income for our team of seamstresses and their families. As our company grows, we look forward to expanding these opportunities for more women in the village.
Rest easy in your hammock knowing that the hands that made it are thriving as a result of its creation.

 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Flying Squirrel Founder

Hi, I’m Brian. Four years ago I quit my comfy job in Seattle, sold my stuff, and headed abroad seeking something new. While traveling, I fell in love with Chiang Mai, Thailand and decided to sink some roots. I began working with local seamstresses, making travel hammocks for tourists. What started as an idea became an experiment and grew into a passion project called Flying Squirrel Outfitters.
I’m inspired by travel and the outdoors. Seeking lush natural beauty has guided me through many stages of my life, including the move to Thailand. I am also inspired by ‘do good’ companies that are defined by their impact. They challenge the status quo and raise standards of quality and compassion. Flying Squirrel Outfitters combines my love of the planet with my love of the people on the planet.
I have a background in marketing and sales at a prominent startup in Seattle. I have personally been managing the Flying Squirrel team and operations for the past year and a half. It has been a wild ride and an enormous learning experience with lots of good vibes along the way. Asking for Help
We are enticed by the vision of GIANT hammocks hanging all over the world. We are asking for help because our small company doesn't yet have the capacity to launch such a capital-intensive new product alone. The hammocks purchased in this campaign will allow us to buy materials in bulk and offer more opportunity to our team of seamstresses. One small step for the hammocking community, one GIANT step for Flying Squirrel Outfitters!   
If you are not into hammocks ...what's wrong with you? Just kidding, We are sure you have your reasons (childhood trauma from being forgotten in a hammock on a family vacation?). But you can still help!

<p>The idea of this project is to create a major photo-documentary record of<b> Mother Nature and its Landscapes  from Bird Eye View</b>. India is covered with a vast landscapes, Cultural Heritages and wide spread green serenity. This will help me explore the art that lies below the skies and above the land.</p>
<p>Getting inspired from lots of Aerial Photographs takes me to a greater imagination of Earth from a Aerial View. Have you ever Imagined. I believe that I can do this. This what pushes me forward. Financial is my only barrier.</p>
<p> An so I need your help.</p>
<p>Aerial View either attained by Helicopter or a Unmanned Drone, but I'm doing with a Kite, a large kite that can lift a heavy camera.</p> </div> <div> <p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This can be made possible by using a Large Kite to lift a camera and make photographs from a high altitude. This is called Kite Aerial Photography.</span><br/></p>

</div><div>For Kite Aerial Photography, all we need is Obliviously a Kite, a Rig that takes the camera, a Radio Controller to control the rig and a Video Transmitter to Frame you picture.</div><div> For all these thing, I took knowledge from various place and managed to make my own rig.</div><div>
<h3><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F5ldqA5jps3E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5ldqA5jps3E&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F5ldqA5jps3E%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div></h3>
<div>In this way, I have fried two of my radio controllers, some of the motor parts etc. In this ways I have put all my money of around $300, which I  saved for future education. Now I'm out of money to proceed further. This I was doing since a year, bit by bit.</div>
<div>All this needs is a Kite. This rig needs a big kite to lift it off the ground. Together I have also stitched a Rokkaku Kite. All it need is to be get framed.</div>
<div>
<h3>What  I need?</h3>
<div>
<b>1.</b> This traditional Chinese kite needs to be framed using sticks. For that I need to get Carbon Fiber Tubes, which is not available in my country. </div>
<div>
<b>2.</b> Stronger kite lines to avoid breaking of line during flight. I have to go for stronger kite lines which can withstand high pound strength.</div>
<div>
<b>3.</b> A good Video Transmitter to frame a picture. A video transmitter set will help to downlink the view, what the camera sees.</div>
</div>
</div><div>All these above things a need to be shipped from USA.</div><h3>What is still need to be done?</h3><div>
<b>1.</b> Built two more kites that suit to different wind condition.</div><div>

The idea of this project is to create a major photo-documentary record of Mother Nature and its Landscapes  from Bird Eye View. India is covered with a vast landscapes, Cultural Heritages and wide spread green serenity. This will help me explore the art that lies below the skies and above the land.
Getting inspired from lots of Aerial Photographs takes me to a greater imagination of Earth from a Aerial View. Have you ever Imagined. I believe that I can do this. This what pushes me forward. Financial is my only barrier.
 An so I need your help.
Aerial View either attained by Helicopter or a Unmanned Drone, but I'm doing with a Kite, a large kite that can lift a heavy camera.   This can be made possible by using a Large Kite to lift a camera and make photographs from a high altitude. This is called Kite Aerial Photography.


Inexpensive way to reach the altitudes of skies
Domestic drones or Quad-copters violate right to privacy 
With drones being unmanned flying machines, can malfunction at anytime and can cause severe damage to public.

Heli Copters are expensive, burning fuels and hard to attain low altitudes.

It's very harder to get the right materials in India. So everything has to me shipped outside my country.
    What have I done till now?



Kite Aerial Photography - Aerial View of Sea Shore Attained by KAP.





For Kite Aerial Photography, all we need is Obliviously a Kite, a Rig that takes the camera, a Radio Controller to control the rig and a Video Transmitter to Frame you picture. For all these thing, I took knowledge from various place and managed to make my own rig.

In this way, I have fried two of my radio controllers, some of the motor parts etc. In this ways I have put all my money of around $300, which I  saved for future education. Now I'm out of money to proceed further. This I was doing since a year, bit by bit.
All this needs is a Kite. This rig needs a big kite to lift it off the ground. Together I have also stitched a Rokkaku Kite. All it need is to be get framed.

What  I need?

1. This traditional Chinese kite needs to be framed using sticks. For that I need to get Carbon Fiber Tubes, which is not available in my country. 

2. Stronger kite lines to avoid breaking of line during flight. I have to go for stronger kite lines which can withstand high pound strength.

3. A good Video Transmitter to frame a picture. A video transmitter set will help to downlink the view, what the camera sees.

All these above things a need to be shipped from USA.What is still need to be done?
1. Built two more kites that suit to different wind condition.
2. Set up a live view downlink from the camera to groundExpenses Required to Complete the project:
1. Carbon Fiber tubes from goodwinds.com
                 16 pcs - .375"" x 40"" Pultruded Carbon Tube             -            $172 ($11 each)2.External Aluminium Ferrules from goodwinds.com                  16 pcs  - .375"" Aluminum Ferrule                                 -             $61($3.8 each)
3. Braided Dacron - Kite Line from goodwinds.com
                         250lb x 3000ft White Braided Dacron               -              $674.FPV Kit from hobbyking.com                                                     -               $805.Shipping the above products to India + Duty                       -               $1256. Pekabe Pulley from ebay                                                           -                $50Transparency:

<p>Before printing, texts were all copied in longhand. Books have been mass-produced for the last five hundred years or so, but printing wasn’t the end of handwriting. Beginning in the 16th century, manuals for teaching how to write became best-sellers.

<p><span>I am 18 years old with a serious passion for mission work. Now with a business and bio-engineering course under my belt, my dream has started taking shape. Burundi is a landlocked country in central Africa. This country has been stuck in a constant cycle of civil war since 1993 due to ethnic violence between the Tutsi-dominated army and armed Hutu rebel groups. Through the fighting, about 550,000 displaced persons have been left without homes and struggle to find just one meal a day. Thus largely depend on international humanitarian assistance. Things in this country have started to turn around with new leadership and a peace agreement. Even with things getting better not a lot is being done by Burundi's government to help the 550,000 displaced people. This is where Unconditional mission’s comes in, we plans to give a home to 40 to 50 kids under the age of 18 or as seen needed. </span></p>
<h2><b>Benefactor assumptions</b></h2>
<p>Unconditional missions only needs 30 people on board to give the average annual donation amount of $2,974, that's just $7.65 a day. Yearly cost for food, schooling, and first aid will only take 11 people to be on board to fulfill our yearly needs. We are assuming we will have unseen costs that will become apparent once we are up and running but has yet been accounted for.</p>

</div></div>","Unconditional mission 
I am 18 years old with a serious passion for mission work. Now with a business and bio-engineering course under my belt, my dream has started taking shape. Burundi is a landlocked country in central Africa. This country has been stuck in a constant cycle of civil war since 1993 due to ethnic violence between the Tutsi-dominated army and armed Hutu rebel groups. Through the fighting, about 550,000 displaced persons have been left without homes and struggle to find just one meal a day. Thus largely depend on international humanitarian assistance. Things in this country have started to turn around with new leadership and a peace agreement. Even with things getting better not a lot is being done by Burundi's government to help the 550,000 displaced people. This is where Unconditional mission’s comes in, we plans to give a home to 40 to 50 kids under the age of 18 or as seen needed. 
Benefactor assumptions
Unconditional missions only needs 30 people on board to give the average annual donation amount of $2,974, that's just $7.65 a day. Yearly cost for food, schooling, and first aid will only take 11 people to be on board to fulfill our yearly needs. We are assuming we will have unseen costs that will become apparent once we are up and running but has yet been accounted for.

 
Start up cost

Unconditional missions will be a light in the darkest places, helping to care for the orphans of an almost forgotten country. Unconditional missions wants to give the kids a chance to live a stable life, not having to wonder about their safety or how they’re going to get their next meal. Each kid will be sponsored by international humanitarian assistance to provide schooling and other daily life essentials. 

Orphanage layout 

The first activity at the orphanage will be to build and operate the new orphanage. The building will be two floors made out of cargo tankers. We will have around 9000 square feet inside of our facility.  
The ground floor will provide the activity rooms, a nursery, kitchen, dining room, study room, sleeping area, and office/first-aid room. The second level will provide a garden and additional storage. 
Funds Management
 Unconditional mission’s guarantees that all funds donated are devoted to pre-authorized projects or activities that you as benefactors have a contributing voice in.

Trends in Burundi 
·  Infant and maternal mortality rates are among the worst in Africa.
·  Poverty increased from 48 to 67 per cent of the population between 1994 and 2006
·  In 2005, up to 53 percent of children under five suffer from stunting due to inadequate food, low-quality diet, poor infant feeding practices, poor household management of childhood diseases and the general decline of the health system.
·  Children are victims of corporal punishment in their families or their schools.·  During the civil war, numerous children were forced to join rebel groups 
Future Plans and Development
The current plans already represent a significantly sized project which will take a number of years to establish. However once the organization is set up and running, we will be working to establishing a boom in Burundi’s exportation industry.
As we learn and develop together, we are excited to bring other people on board to help this cause. Hopefully beginning a short term mission program as well as perusing the exportation industry by taking locale cash crops such as coffee, cotton, and tea from Burundi’s local farmers to exporting their product to the UK and America.

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Hello Everyone! </strong></p>
<p>For those of you who do not know me personally my name is Alyssa Kobza. Thank you for taking time out of your day to visit my funding website. For most of my life I have had an incredibly strong urge to travel. This summer I have an amazing opportunity to travel to Thailand for one month with a group of like-minded students and young adults.</p>
<p>I will be in Thailand for four weeks and as you might imagine each day is going to be packed with adventure. At the bottom I have outlined in detail what each week will have in store, but I will also give you a short run-down. The first two weeks I will be staying in a remote village where I will be teaching English to school aged children. The third week I will be touring Thailand, getting to know Thai culture, and going on adventures. The fourth week I will staying near the beach and working on sea turtle rehabilitation and conservation. </p>

<h3><strong>Detailed Itinerary:</strong></h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Weeks 1 &amp; 2</h3>
<p>I will spend two weeks teaching English to school-aged kids and earn my TEFL certification. A TEFL certification will qualify me to teach english as a foreign language. These two weeks will be spent in the hill-tribe villages of either Ban Lao or Maekon. The day time will be spent teaching English to school kids and studying and practicing how to teach English. Teaching will be done in pairs or one on one and feedback is given from classmates and instructors on ways to improve. During the afternoons there is time to study Thai, teach extracurricular classes such as art and sports, and care for gardens and animals in the community. Whatever is going on in the community is what we will be taking part in.</p>
<p>On the weekends we will tour Chiang Mai. Here we will have the amazing opportunity to trek to hidden temples, bathe with elephants at ‘Elephant Nature Park,’ swim under waterfalls, zip-line through the rainforest canopy and take in everything the ancient city has to offer.</p>
<p>Even after returning to the US I will still be provided benefits from this trip; Loop Abroad offers assistance to Alumni after graduating college in finding a job in the field. Loop Abroad will help my write my resume, cover letter, and prep me for interviews. They even connect me with English learning centers from around the world and set up interviews along with providing a recommendation. The benefits of this trip will last me a lifetime and create an infinite amount of possibilities in the future.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Week 3 &amp; 4</h3>
<p>I will spend the third week of the program based in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Known as the ""Rose of the North"", this mountain city is the perfect base from which to explore rain forests, mountains, cloud forests, and the beautiful culture of Thailand. In Doi Inthanon National Park we will see ancient temples that rise above the clouds line and waterfalls that seem to be at the top of the world. This week we will volunteer with the university on a reforestation project and spend time rafting a jungle river. The group will spend a day ziplining through the rainforest and learn how zipline projects contribute to conservation efforts.  We will take an amazing overnight trek into the jungle, including a visit to a hilltribe village and an overnight at a hot springs. We will wander through a mountain templed into the Chiang Dao caves and explore its depths by lantern light. This week is dedicated to experiencing everything Thailand has to offer. We will experience the culture more vividly during cultural activities such as a meditation lesson with Buddhist monks, shopping in the city craft and food markets, visiting an arts village, making paper and touring 700 year old temples.</p>
<p>In week 4, we fly and ferry to the island of Koh Tao (""Turtle Island"") in the Gulf of Thailand. With the little sandy bay just steps from our rooms, we will fill our days with morning beachside yoga, supporting the sea turtle nursery, snorkeling to track marine life, building an artificial reef, and learning from the experts at New Heaven about marine animals and conservation. The last day of this week will be spent at Elephant Nature Park where I will have one more amazing experience with elephants before headed back to the United States.</p>

<p>1. The Maximum beam distance is based on the minimum “obstacle avoidance” and “safety” illuminance (0.2 Lux) that is achieved at the stated beam distance. A mean illuminance level of 0.2 lx on the ground is considered to be sufficient to avoid striking obstacles based on experiments performed by Simmons (1975), Nikitin (1973), Jaschinski (1982), M.J. Ouellette and M.S. Rea (1989) et al. 0.2 lux is the recommended minimum illuminance for emergency evacuation and safety lighting as per many emergency lighting, safety standards and building codes adopted the world over including Australian &amp; New Zealand Standard-AS2293, British Standard- BS 5266-1:2011,European Standard- IEC 60598-2-22, Russian Daylight and Artificial Lighting emergency- SNiP 23-05-95, etc.</p>

<h3>DESIGN STORY</h3>
<p>The “Util-Lite” as presented to you, began evolution from around 1991, 27 years ago, when I desired to own a useful, bright flashlight small enough to fit on a keychain and/or be comfortable enough within a tight pocket. I believed that such an instrument would already be on the market and that I should be able to purchase it and was just a matter of finding it. I then examined and purchased every small torch I could find and was somewhat disappointed with them all, either they were not robust enough, some made from plastic or the shape not ergonomic or aesthetically pleasing to me, worst of all, most didn’t provide a useful illumination.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488218697/fnmn9tbrgoxfvujerrkj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It was during this time, that I began to make by modifying commercially available flashlights combining the best of certain feature that I tested in field and found desirable. There was no internet as we know it today, at the time, the internet, only communicated 1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks but as I was in the lighting industry I was lucky enough to have access to many light source catalogues from all over the world, therefore access to specialist medical, indicator, optical and scientific light sources that could make a tiny flashlight more useful. I began to evaluate, calculate lifetime and hours of use over brightness and catalogued all useful light sources I came across.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488254793/gwro6pdo34gsbxau1hyb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I also experimented with a variety of multi flashlight/spark/laser/firelighter/ultrasonic configurations including a laser/flashlight/firelighter as well as a laser/flashlight/electric plasma and many other combinations that used different light sources from incandescent, using halogen, krypton and xenon lamps, multi LEDs or single high brightness LEDs. From around 1994, I mainly used LED/s as lowlights, I also developed multiturn laser filter pattern generators. I then began to use high brightness LED’s in my own flashlight, years before they became commercially available. I settled on a compact tubular bullet shaped design, that would accept either AAA battery, LR44 cells or the most powerful lithium batteries as they became more commonly available.</p>
<p>I then began to combine and later modified several features based on tried and tested usefulness, such as a variety of multisource laser/flashlight spark/arc or firelighter sources that I carried around with me to determine an unbiased usefulness and show people, to see their interest and if they would ask me to make one for them, which many did.</p>
<p>One early prototype version that I unintentionally filmed, can be seen, used as a light pointer in my “antigravity” videos, - “ANTIGRAVITY”- The Reality, originally filmed between 1991 to 1996, with 15 methods of levitating an object known to myself with heavier than air devices usually referred to as “anti-gravity” as they achieve flight without propellers, jets or rocket propulsion, click on this link. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/JOHNROMANIWASZKO"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/user/JOHNROMANIWASZKO</a></p>
<p>Video’s shown on YouTube were filmed from 1991 to 1996, where I use a prototype of the “Util-Lite” multi-light source as a pointer.</p>

<p>The “Util-Lite” we offer you is based on an extremely portable, ergonomic light source made of robust stainless steel, as I found that many coatings on other metals wear, rust and chip, aluminium the most often used metal, for so called “robust” flashlights, even anodized, easily dents and scratches. I have also utilised the latest LED technology with two useful brightness’s as well as a useful firelighter, the very basic requirement based on my own experiments and market research.</p>

<p>After many years of road testing, and mainly popular demand, I decided to turn my own unique project to work and put the Util-Lite in everybody's pocket or keyring. I wanted others to take advantage of something that I found ideal in my adventures, for everyday use at home or work. After testing, many of the current solutions on the market, I started to narrow in down to what I found that I liked and didn’t like with all the other products, I road tested.</p>
<p>I also took many flashlights and lighters apart to see how I could make them more versatile and compact. After many years of rigorous testing and prototyping, I decided on a single unit, with more features on future products that will of course be larger in size.</p>
<p>After deciding on a specific look, I built a prototype based on what I found to be the most pleasing and aesthetically desirable shape. This took years of hard work.</p>
<h3>Putting the Prototype to the Test</h3>
<p>I spent many years road-testing various designs, I do a lot of fossicking for meteorites and tektites in extremely harsh Australian conditions on a regular basis and have found the prototype an extremely great asset in times of need particularly when walking the dog at night, on camping trips, TV cable device fault finding and looking for tektites and meteorites.</p>

 CLASSIC SIMPLICITY:
Twist the head to turn on, for a low output, half a turn more for high output, turn in the opposite direction for off, MODERN POWER Next-generation LED for a whole new level of brightness particularly for its size, is equal to many other flash lights five to ten times its size currently on the market, just compare the specs!
A state of the art LED light engine for unprecedented performance.
The opposing end includes a firelighter constructed of 300 Series Stainless Steel and can be carried in your pants pocket or stored with your camping equipment for a long period without the fluid leaking or drying out. This firelighter uses standard liquid lighter fluid that you will need to add on your own.
It’s also flat on the flash light end so it can be used as a candle in an emergency or for that sporadic romantic moment, light a candle, a cigarette or whatever turns you on.
Removable lighter insert also allows it to be used as a waterproof stainless steel pill vial.
Easy turn spark wheel, perfect for extended trips where you will need more than a few days of fire-starting.
Comes with Spare Flints + Spare O Rings
Features:
• Easy to use
• Powerful Projecting LED Beam
• 2 Selectable Modes:
High Power 100% 165 Lumens
Low Power (9%) 14 lumens
• Perfect Uniform LED beam
• Rugged, machined stainless steel case
• Compact design
• Powered by a single rechargeable Lithium Cell battery

1. The Maximum beam distance is based on the minimum “obstacle avoidance” and “safety” illuminance (0.2 Lux) that is achieved at the stated beam distance. A mean illuminance level of 0.2 lx on the ground is considered to be sufficient to avoid striking obstacles based on experiments performed by Simmons (1975), Nikitin (1973), Jaschinski (1982), M.J. Ouellette and M.S. Rea (1989) et al. 0.2 lux is the recommended minimum illuminance for emergency evacuation and safety lighting as per many emergency lighting, safety standards and building codes adopted the world over including Australian & New Zealand Standard-AS2293, British Standard- BS 5266-1:2011,European Standard- IEC 60598-2-22, Russian Daylight and Artificial Lighting emergency- SNiP 23-05-95, etc.
Fire Up No Matter the Occasion

Regular butane lighters are riddled with problems - they don’t work well in the wind or when they’re wet, and they can run out of fuel without any warning. Have no fear, Util-Lite is here. Its high-intensity fire lighter flame - works in the wind, rain, and snow. Gasket sealed to prevent water going in or liquid flowing out.



Also, this amazingly tiny configuration contains a 70 mAh rechargeable Lithium Cell (Li-Ion) with a proprietary circuit design that features reverse polarity diode protection, ensuring no accidental damage that also provides 2 levels of brightness (Low / High).
Twist on for Low that achieves 14 lumens output for up to 6 hours.
Or then Twist 1/2 more of a turn for High mode which achieves an amazing specified 180 lumens, tested at 179 lumens maximum, (165 Lumens mean), output at 610 candelas- mean average for up to 25 minutes.
Three Ways to Light Up, 3 levels of Brightness

Chances are, if you’re in need of a light, that you may also have need for a flame. That’s why we decided to combine a high-efficiency next generation bright LED flashlight with a fire lighter.
FLASHLIGHT-2 brightness settings LOW & HIGH
WIDE ANGLE BEAM 120o max., 60 o mid-range and 18.2 o half beam, WITH UP TO a maximum specified-180 Lumens total Light output, the prototype, “the system”, tested at an average of 165 Lumens, based on photometric bench tests -174 lumens, goniometer tests-169 lumens, and Integrating photometer-154 lumens, multiple averaged tests, with an accuracy of ± 3%. Therefore 149.4 % being the lowest possible lumens and 179.2 lumens, the highest based on many, averaged rigorous tests of the prototype.

Small & light enough to wear as a pendant.


The tiny Util-Lite will emit up to 180 lumens of light in your hand, with its tiny size of only 6cm (2.4 inch) x 1.4cm (0.5 inch) nominal, making the most of the latest LED technology, comparable to many far larger flashlights, allowing you to confidently make your way through the dark. Choose from two brightness settings for a light that perfectly suits your needs.
The Ultil-Lite light source and circuitry ultilises ground breaking AurumSolis Patented technology that achieve an incredible tested average efficacy of 154 lumens per watt at maximum brightness, with a colour rendering index, specified at 70, tested at 73.7 max, the Color Rendering Index (CRI) is a scale from 0 to 100 percent indicating how accurate a ""given"" light source is at rendering colour when compared to a ""reference"" light source. The higher the CRI, the better the color rendering ability, which is more than the previous record achieved with a huge High pressure sodium (SON) lamps, the most energy efficient light source known with a reasonable colour rendering index of only CRI 25, and achieved 120 lumens per watt and is over half way to the theoretical limit for a white LED with phosphorescence, between 260 to 300 lumens per watt. 1 You will be amazed at what this tiny flash light will achieve and even more so that it provides a source of flame as well.
The maximum Beam angle (beam spread) is 120 degrees, the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) is 18.2 degrees, so you get the best of both worlds, an intense spot and wide flood.
Charge It On-The-Go

Rather than using a traditional flimsy micro USB port cover, we created a simple mechanism to keep your port free of dirt and dust. Just twist off the flashlight head and twist on the Micro USB charging port made of stainless steel. The additional charging head reveals the micro USB charging port to easily charge up your Util-Lite anywhere. It also indicates when charge is complete, red light indicates charging, green indicates charge complete.
RECHARGEABLE VIA USB
Charge Complete - Green Indicator
Charging - Red Indicator
Long Battery Life
The small 70 mAh rechargeable lithium ion battery can power the Util-Lite flashlight for up to 25 minutes on high and 6 hours on low. When not in use, the battery can hold its charge for up to a year.

Durable stainless steel body, Tiny and Ergonomic

The Util-Lite was designed to be both a functional flashlight and a fire lighter (for a full list of features, please scroll down to the Specification section below).
The Body is made of highly durable, 300 series stainless steel. The lens cover has an ergonomically molded thumb grip to ensure comfort and easy turning when handling. The firelighter cover is a quick twist off and lock for covering the firelighter, when not in use, it is so seamless that most people would not believe that there is an additional compartment there that can also be used for storing pills or whatever you can fit within.
Does your precious pocket space belong to only the most useful and compact of tools? Well its exactly what I wanted and designed 27 years ago, if you want a lot of utility in the smallest package possible, the Util-Lite has been specifically designed for you. 
With an ergonomic shape, it functions, much like a traditional flashlight, but it also has a built-in firelighter on the opposing end so that it can be used as a source of flame. 
Fire up in Style

The Util-Light offers a classic look with improved function. It’s smooth and robust stainless steel finish provides a premium and durable feel. The Stainless-steel casing is ideal for a robust highly durable tool. It also allows the lighter to take a form that will feel good in your hand and your pocket. Safe, simple and sleek - this flashlight and lighter will be sure to turn a few heads.
A light when you need it most

Never be caught in the dark again. The Util-Lite is small enough to carry with you wherever you go. Anyone got a light? You will have both.
An Everyday Carry

The Util-Lite is compact enough for a pocket but also powerful enough to withstand the wind, rain, snow and light up your surroundings. Taking up minimal space in your pocket, purse or pack, this high-power firelighter and flashlight combo is ready whenever you need it. No more worrying about running out of fuel - just charge it up while you sleep, fill up with lighter fuel and you’re set for many days.

Key to the amazing efficacy of 154 Lumens per watt are two major peaks of the LED spectrum, one at 555 nm, which corresponds to the peak average spectral sensitivity of human visual perception of brightness in the yellow green region of the spectrum that extends to the red but not too far towards the IR which is invisible to the human eye and is experienced by humans as heat, as well as a higher peak in the blue region that makes the combined light appear white to human eyes as per the CIE 1931 or CIE 1976 color space coordinate system-refer below, a quantitative link between physical pure colours (i.e. wavelengths) in the electromagnetic visible spectrum, and physiological perceived colors in human colour vision. The combined spectrum maximizes efficacy without compromising the colour the human eye perceives, to achieve a good daylight colour with good colour rendering CRI of 70+.

DESIGN STORY
The “Util-Lite” as presented to you, began evolution from around 1991, 27 years ago, when I desired to own a useful, bright flashlight small enough to fit on a keychain and/or be comfortable enough within a tight pocket. I believed that such an instrument would already be on the market and that I should be able to purchase it and was just a matter of finding it. I then examined and purchased every small torch I could find and was somewhat disappointed with them all, either they were not robust enough, some made from plastic or the shape not ergonomic or aesthetically pleasing to me, worst of all, most didn’t provide a useful illumination.

It was during this time, that I began to make by modifying commercially available flashlights combining the best of certain feature that I tested in field and found desirable. There was no internet as we know it today, at the time, the internet, only communicated 1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunications networks but as I was in the lighting industry I was lucky enough to have access to many light source catalogues from all over the world, therefore access to specialist medical, indicator, optical and scientific light sources that could make a tiny flashlight more useful. I began to evaluate, calculate lifetime and hours of use over brightness and catalogued all useful light sources I came across.

I also experimented with a variety of multi flashlight/spark/laser/firelighter/ultrasonic configurations including a laser/flashlight/firelighter as well as a laser/flashlight/electric plasma and many other combinations that used different light sources from incandescent, using halogen, krypton and xenon lamps, multi LEDs or single high brightness LEDs. From around 1994, I mainly used LED/s as lowlights, I also developed multiturn laser filter pattern generators. I then began to use high brightness LED’s in my own flashlight, years before they became commercially available. I settled on a compact tubular bullet shaped design, that would accept either AAA battery, LR44 cells or the most powerful lithium batteries as they became more commonly available.
I then began to combine and later modified several features based on tried and tested usefulness, such as a variety of multisource laser/flashlight spark/arc or firelighter sources that I carried around with me to determine an unbiased usefulness and show people, to see their interest and if they would ask me to make one for them, which many did.
One early prototype version that I unintentionally filmed, can be seen, used as a light pointer in my “antigravity” videos, - “ANTIGRAVITY”- The Reality, originally filmed between 1991 to 1996, with 15 methods of levitating an object known to myself with heavier than air devices usually referred to as “anti-gravity” as they achieve flight without propellers, jets or rocket propulsion, click on this link. https://www.youtube.com/user/JOHNROMANIWASZKO
Video’s shown on YouTube were filmed from 1991 to 1996, where I use a prototype of the “Util-Lite” multi-light source as a pointer.

Prototype “Util-Lite” left, from a video in the 90’s, with Laser diode, middle, focusable flash light head where I can be seen focusing the output incandescent light source head at 0.10 to 0.13 refer “Antigravity” Method video 1b of 15 and right, high brightness blue/white LED

Prototype “Util-Lite” left, from video in the 90’s, with High Brightness Red LED, middle and right, pin point output RED laser diode.
The original inspiration of this series was to show interested people “REAL” experiments that can levitate objects, real is defined as “SCIENTIFIC” experiments that are repeatable by others.
Over the years, I also experimented with many other interesting projects. From antigravity, Tesla Coils, wireless electricity, extremely efficient light sources, robots, nuclear fusion etc. Refer our web site “about” page to site a glimpse. http://antigravity.net.au/wp/about-us/

 

The “Util-Lite” we offer you is based on an extremely portable, ergonomic light source made of robust stainless steel, as I found that many coatings on other metals wear, rust and chip, aluminium the most often used metal, for so called “robust” flashlights, even anodized, easily dents and scratches. I have also utilised the latest LED technology with two useful brightness’s as well as a useful firelighter, the very basic requirement based on my own experiments and market research.

After many years of road testing, and mainly popular demand, I decided to turn my own unique project to work and put the Util-Lite in everybody's pocket or keyring. I wanted others to take advantage of something that I found ideal in my adventures, for everyday use at home or work. After testing, many of the current solutions on the market, I started to narrow in down to what I found that I liked and didn’t like with all the other products, I road tested.
I also took many flashlights and lighters apart to see how I could make them more versatile and compact. After many years of rigorous testing and prototyping, I decided on a single unit, with more features on future products that will of course be larger in size.
After deciding on a specific look, I built a prototype based on what I found to be the most pleasing and aesthetically desirable shape. This took years of hard work.
Putting the Prototype to the Test
I spent many years road-testing various designs, I do a lot of fossicking for meteorites and tektites in extremely harsh Australian conditions on a regular basis and have found the prototype an extremely great asset in times of need particularly when walking the dog at night, on camping trips, TV cable device fault finding and looking for tektites and meteorites.
I have personally used the prototype over many years in real world scenarios from campfires to candles and had a great time with it! Thanks for taking the time to learn more about our amazing product and the story behind it. I wouldn't be here without your support.",46.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Newcastle Lanterns</h3>
<ul>
<li>Newcastle Lanterns are a group of volunteers who produce Newcastle's winter lantern parade in December in  Newcastle Under Lyme.</li>
<li>We checked if you wanted this event to continue and were met with a resounding YES.</li>
<li>Your donation will allow us to expand the parade to include more huge lanterns, music and costumes: something to rival bigger cities and put Newcastle on the map. Your donation will enable us to continue to include children from families who can't afford to take part otherwise. Your donation will light up the streets with community art.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We have secured funding from the <strong>Arts Council</strong> for the artists' time and expertise in running the workshops and parade. <strong>B-Arts</strong> provide this support, and bring over 30 years of experience to the project. We fundraise to cover materials and premises. Our time is donated. We ask for donations of £5.00 per lantern, which is more than some people can afford. You can either pay for your workshop place in advance, or use this crowdfunder to donate a workshop place to a child who can't afford it.</li>
<li>We are very grateful for your time and for your faith in making your donation. For a £5 donation you will receive a screenprinted thank you card. For a £10 donation you will receive a hand-printed poster. If you donate £50 towards our large lantern image you will have your name published in the thank you list.</li>
<li>The lantern workshops and parade are guarenteed to happen regardless of the target we manage to reach.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Newcastle Lantern parade has run since 2012. Our feedback from participants and audience members includes comments 'breathtaking... great way to celebrate community... enjoying spending time making something with my Dad...' and many more. We had over 600 lantern makers last year. Making a lantern made each of them understand themselves to be creative and connected, and they all had a lot of fun.</li>
<li>We work with community groups who do not have the opportunity to feel creative and connected in other areas of their lives. Your donation matters to them.</li>
</ul>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate today but still want to help, here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Come to a workshop and make a lantern</li>
<li>Offer some time to volunteer - you can help with press contacts, publicity, help to run a workshop session, volunteer to steward the parade.</li>
<li>Share, re-tweet, tell people that you speak to, let people know that we need support.</li>
</ul>

Your donation will enable us to continue to include children from families who can't afford to take part otherwise. Your donation will light up the streets with community art.

 

What We Need & What You Get
 

We have secured funding from the Arts Council for the artists' time and expertise in running the workshops and parade. B-Arts provide this support, and bring over 30 years of experience to the project. We fundraise to cover materials and premises. Our time is donated. We ask for donations of £5.00 per lantern, which is more than some people can afford. You can either pay for your workshop place in advance, or use this crowdfunder to donate a workshop place to a child who can't afford it.
We are very grateful for your time and for your faith in making your donation. For a £5 donation you will receive a screenprinted thank you card. For a £10 donation you will receive a hand-printed poster. If you donate £50 towards our large lantern image you will have your name published in the thank you list.
The lantern workshops and parade are guarenteed to happen regardless of the target we manage to reach.


The Impact

Newcastle Lantern parade has run since 2012. Our feedback from participants and audience members includes comments 'breathtaking... great way to celebrate community... enjoying spending time making something with my Dad...' and many more. We had over 600 lantern makers last year. Making a lantern made each of them understand themselves to be creative and connected, and they all had a lot of fun.
We work with community groups who do not have the opportunity to feel creative and connected in other areas of their lives. Your donation matters to them.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate today but still want to help, here's how:

Come to a workshop and make a lantern
Offer some time to volunteer - you can help with press contacts, publicity, help to run a workshop session, volunteer to steward the parade.
Share, re-tweet, tell people that you speak to, let people know that we need support.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The airline industry has not changed in over 60 years and we shouldn't be forced to sit next a random person. Humans control almost every aspect of their lives, their personalized taxi (Uber) and their hotel room (Airbnb) etc. So why not control who you sit next to on your airline flight? It's time to control your flying experience.</p>

In our opinion, you either love sailing or you never sailed!</p>
<p><strong>What if I do not live near water?</strong>
<br/>The 3FOLDBOAT is easy to transport on the roofrack of a car or even in the car if it's a big one. You can take it with you on your holidays or a weekend out or you could even go sailing on a nice summer evening after a busy day!</p>
<p><strong>What when I live in an apartment builing or a small house?</strong>
<br/>For people that have not much space, the 3FOLDBOAT is the ideal boat. You can put it against a wall on shelf brackets or even place it vertical in a corner of a spare bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>We own a big boat. Should we consider bringing a 3FOLDBOAT?</strong> <br/>If you have a 3FOLDBOAT on board, you can use it to access the narrow and shallow waters that are inaccessible for big boats, either with the mast and sails up or with a light electric motor. The 3FOLDBOAT is also ideal for fishing!</p>
