<p><strong>Our beloved theater desperately needs to be repainted.</strong> That's where you, our audience and admirers come in! The theater offers a great space for performances, classes and rehearsals and the exterior should match the amenities inside. If you've ever attended Frenetic Theater for a performance, for an event, taken a dance class or brought your child to FrenetiKids, you know the theater would look ten times better with a fresh coat of paint.</p>
<p><img alt=""Frenetic Theater Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://freneticore.net/sitebuilder/images/Frenetic-THeater-logo-270x84.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Frenetic Theater Logo""/><strong>Our Mission:</strong>  Frenetic Theater promotes the creation and presentation of new work in Houston by providing an accessible, affordable venue for the exhibition of performing and visual arts; offers educational outreach programs for children and adults; and produces the annual Houston Fringe festival to promote cutting-edge theatre, dance, film, music, and visual arts in Houston.</p>
<p><strong>Our History:</strong> In 2006, the FrenetiCore's directors purchased a 17,000 square foot machine shop on Houston’s east side with the aim of creating a community arts center and offering affordable theater/rehearsal space for local artists. FrenetiCore renovated the warehouse and built a new handicapped-accessible theater complete with a 1,300 square foot stage, theater seating for 100, an eighty foot long exhibit hall for immersive film and visual arts, and a lobby with spacious bathrooms and concession bar.  The theater space has hosted productions by the Houston Cinema Arts Festival, Vault Dance Company, Aurora Picture Show, Horse Head Theatre, MECA, Nameless Sound, FrenetiCore, Sol Y Luna Dance, Jhon Stronks, Houston Flamenco Festival, Unhinged Productions, Pandora Theater, 48 Hour Film Festival, Psophonia Dance, and Bobbindoctrin Puppet Theater, among many others.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Frenetic Theater needs some serious repainting and we need your help to produce the funds for sandblasting, labor costs and the paint itself. We know our loyal supporters want to keep coming back to a fresh looking facility and will be willing to step up and help. Our goal is to repaint the theater before our upcoming show opens mid-July and before it gets too darn hot!</p>
<p>We will offer donors incentives like social media thank yous, tickets to FrenetiCore's July show, the 2012 Houston Fringe Festival, Apocalypse Ball and more. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our building serves as the location for a free after school dance/theater kids program, weekly adult dance classes, rehearsals, performances, festivals, workshops , fundraisers and community events. Keeping Frenetic Theater looking its best helps to ensure our patrons feel at ease and eager to return at every chance they get.</p>
<p>FrenetiCore rennovated the theater from the ground up so repainting will be a breeze. We just need your help to raise the funds. And we need to paint now before Houston hits record breaking temperatures!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Every donation makes a difference and pushes us closer to our goal. Besides monetary donations, you can also support our campaign by sharing the link via email, blog, Facebook, Twitter and any other way you can. Thank you!</p></div>","Help Us Paint Frenetic Theater!

<p><strong>Hey Everyone!</strong><br/>
Thanks for visiting our site! <br/>
We are a group of friends and collaborators coming together from across the country to mount the premier of Matt Schwartz’s play <em>What Comes Next</em> at <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Atlantic Fringe Festiva</a>! in Halifax, Nova Scotia . We are one of the few international groups selected to be in the festival and are excited to undertake this artistic adventure. Now, this is not your standard sit down, watch, yawn, applaud and then leave type of theater. It is a refracted, kaleidoscopic view of life that engages the audience’s imagination and pulls them into the world of the play.  At times funny, touching, scary or heartbreaking, What Comes Next experiments with the conventions of performance to profoundly communicate the human experience of wandering, stumbling in the dark, finding your path and then stumbling once again.</p>
<p>And we need your help to stumble!</p>
<p>We are asking for your support to help cover our travel and production expenses (such as the registration fee, posters, publicity, props and costumes). It’s a lot of work to put on a production and we will be supremely grateful for anything that you can offer. We believe that theater is a collaborative art and consider your support an essential contribution to this process. So come join us, we’d love to have you on this adventure.</p>

<h3>The Wizard of Oz</h3>
<p>The Rising Stars Theatre Company is currently in rehearsals for The Wizard of Oz, to be presented April 25-May 5, 2013. We are a completely self-funded not-for-profit company and our production costs have increased dramatically over the past few years. Any help we can get in order to produce this show would be greatly appreciated. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Rising Stars Theatre Company</h3>
<p>The Rising Stars Theatre Company was founded in 1979 by the late Ann Dunn, producing musical revues for the local community performed by Ann's current and former students at Portage Park School. In 1987, the company transformed itself into a community theater organization with mostly adult casts performing Broadway musicals in a theatrical venue.</p>
<p>Since then, the company has reliably produced two full-length musicals a year, growing into a beloved arts institution in the northwest Chicago community. Our productions include Broadway classics like ""Guys and Dolls"" or more contemporary fare, such as ""Hairspray"" presented by talented amateur performers from across Chicagoland.</p>
<p>A more detailed history of The Rising Stars Theatre Company, including production history, can be found at <a href=""http://www.risingstarschicago.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.risingstarschicago.com</a>.</p>

<p>The classic 1939 movie, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" is re-imagined as a stage musical, including Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg's original score, and an expanded book based on the film screenplay.</p>
<p>This production will be performed at The Stahl Family Theatre, 5900 W. Belmont, Chicago IL. The Stahl Family Theatre is a 300-seat state-of-the-art theatre featuring stadium seating and a 3-sided stage.</p>
<p>The production features a cast of 30+ adults, young adults, and children.</p>
<p>This production is particularly challenging from a technical perspective because of the need for special effects, video projection, and other requirements to re-create scenes from the original film.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where This Will Go</h3>
<p>This money will help ensure we will be able to meet the technical needs of our production. It will also defray the costs for renting our rehearsal space, a cost that has increased significantly recently.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are always in need of people to help with the production aspects of our show, including set painting and construciton, props, hair, make up, backstage crew, and ushers. Please contact us at <a href=""mailto:info@risingstarschicago.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@risingstarschicago.com</a>or on our Facebook page if you are interested in helping with the production.</p>

The Rising Stars Theatre Company is currently in rehearsals for The Wizard of Oz, to be presented April 25-May 5, 2013. We are a completely self-funded not-for-profit company and our production costs have increased dramatically over the past few years. Any help we can get in order to produce this show would be greatly appreciated. 


The Rising Stars Theatre Company
The Rising Stars Theatre Company was founded in 1979 by the late Ann Dunn, producing musical revues for the local community performed by Ann's current and former students at Portage Park School. In 1987, the company transformed itself into a community theater organization with mostly adult casts performing Broadway musicals in a theatrical venue.
Since then, the company has reliably produced two full-length musicals a year, growing into a beloved arts institution in the northwest Chicago community. Our productions include Broadway classics like ""Guys and Dolls"" or more contemporary fare, such as ""Hairspray"" presented by talented amateur performers from across Chicagoland.
A more detailed history of The Rising Stars Theatre Company, including production history, can be found at www.risingstarschicago.com.


The Show
The classic 1939 movie, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" is re-imagined as a stage musical, including Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg's original score, and an expanded book based on the film screenplay.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, we are Federico, Fernanda and Elizabeth, students from Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico city, that along with a great team have been working on this play for almost three years now. This project is written, choreographed, directed and produced by students.</p>
<p>We're making this show for several reasons:</p>
<p>1. This play will help us get our bacherlor's degree and to graduate.</p>
<p>2. It will raise funds to help immigrants that arrive to Mexico city. (People that assist the play will help us raise food, clothes and other items that will be destined to ""Casa del Migrante"" where immigrants are assisted.)</p>
<p>3. But mainly because we are so very passionate of theatre and we believe in the story that we're tellling.</p>
<p>""No tengas cuidado con lo que deseas"" is about fighting to reach your goals even when everyone tells you it's too late for you or that your dreams are unrealistic...and that's exactly what we're doing.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>By funding our project you will help us to make this dream come to life. We need this money to present the play in an actual theatre (until now it will only be featured inside our University) and also to pay for our scenery, props and sound equipment that will help us make the very better version of this play.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is <strong>Heather Closson</strong> and I’m a student at Ball State University. I am choreographing/producing an original dance production- <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>DANCE BREAK</strong></span>. As a dance major and a technical theatre minor with a strong interest in fundraising for the arts, I’m hoping to combine all of my interests into one capstone project that will benefit the Muncie community.  Set up as a collaborative project with the Muncie Civic Theatre, I intend on donating all funds raised towards the theatre’s general fund.  The show will feature music from nine different musicals that span across multiple time periods.</p>
<p><strong>SAVE THE DATE: MARCH 15, 2013 @ 7:30 PM.</strong></p>
<p>For this project, I’m looking to raise at least $500 to go towards purchasing costumes and other production needs, including compensating everyone that has worked on my show with some sort of appreciation. There are nearly 30 people participating in my show, so I have quite a few costumes and “thank you”’s to provide! But don’t worry- If you’re able to donate, there are perks designed to show my appreciation towards your generosity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If you donate..</strong></p>
<p>..$10, you’ll receive a special thanks in the program and a FREE Civic Deal at the concession stand</p>
<p>..$25, you’ll receive  an autographed copy of the poster, as well as the above mentioned items.</p>
<p>..$40 , you’ll receive 2 tickets with priority seating, as well as the above mentioned items.</p>
<p>..$50, you’ll receive a DVD of the full performance, as well as the above mentioned items.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want to make a significant<strong> impact</strong> on our university and the community. A collaborator by nature, I am interested in impacting those around me the most. By utilizing my skill sets, I can continue to endorse the name of this university, as well as the Department of Theatre and Dance, in our community. This production will be raising funds and attention for an organization in the Muncie community, helping expose the arts in new light and, hopefully, for years to come.</p>
<p>If you’re unable to contribute financially, that’s okay! There are other ways to help. Spreading the word about this production is just as valuable as anything else. So go, get out and make some noise about <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>DANCE BREAK</strong></span>!</p>

The Story
A haunting tale that begins in a cave on the edge of a rural North Carolina town, where a young girl once went missing. One of nine friends is responsible for her death, yet her ghostly, echoed cries will haunt each of them forever.

(what else?) <i>theatre</i>.</p><p>In all sincerity, we got together in some trying times and had this grand, delusional aim of providing a space for ourselves and our friends and fellow artists to do work and—hotheadedly enough—we hoped to, in some small but powerful way, reinvigorate the American theater. </p><p><b>OUR GOAL</b></p><p>Aroma Theater Collaborative is a new company dedicated not to producing a particular kind of work, or espousing an aesthetic, but to empowering theater artists. Our goal is to provide artists with the context, motivation, support, even some financial resources, but above all, the opportunity to make work and put it in front of an audience.

(what else?) theatre.In all sincerity, we got together in some trying times and had this grand, delusional aim of providing a space for ourselves and our friends and fellow artists to do work and—hotheadedly enough—we hoped to, in some small but powerful way, reinvigorate the American theater. OUR GOALAroma Theater Collaborative is a new company dedicated not to producing a particular kind of work, or espousing an aesthetic, but to empowering theater artists.

<span><b>WE'VE SET A STRETCH GOAL OF $12,000 AND ADDED NEW PERKS!!!</b><br/></span></p>
<p><span>WE MET OUR GOAL BECAUSE OF YOU!! We are overjoyed at the
outpouring of love and support that has taken us on this ride of fundraising
via crowdfunding. We set our goal at $5,000 because we wanted to be realistic —
to dip our toes into the uncharted (for us) waters by creating a campaign that
would be of interest both to our longtime supporters, and to people just
discovering AHA.
As you’ve likely read in our campaign story, the costumes alone for our
Merrie Monarch trip will cost us well over $15,000. So we intend to keep going
strong for our final 8 days — through midnight March 19 — and set a <b>stretch
goal of $12,000</b>.<br/>
<br/>
There are still so many reasons to reach out to contribute. Showing your love
for AHA and the perpetuation of the Hawaiian culture is just the beginning. 

</span>You could choose a cool, fun perk. And we
decided to add some new perks to give you some different options to consider,
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>$50 Video Shout Out from the
     Airplane</b><span> AHA Dancers will shoot
     a video shout-out to you on the plane to the Merrie Monarch — you never
     know what you’re going to see with a bunch of excited dancers heading to
     Hawaii!</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>$60 Day of Rehearsal Stage photo</b><span> We get a very short
     window of time to rehearse at Edith Kanaka’ole Stadium, and you will be
     one of the very first to receive in your inbox a digital photo from our
     AHA photographer, Uncle Kimo (James Doiron, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/In%C4%81-Hawaii-Imagine-Hawaii/300313966677624"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Inā Hawai’i</a>), the only non-MM
     photographer who will have the privilege of photographing AHA rehearsing
     on stage</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And
remember that we will still be updating the Private Blog that already exists at
the $100 level. So there will be a lot of fun photos and video clips that you
will be able to access while we are in Hilo. We're picturing messy dorm rooms,
lots of eating of food, and maybe negotiations over the limited number of
outlets in our rooms.</p>
<p>So go ahead - choose your perk - and let’s
crush this!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Mahalo nui</i> for your continuing support!</p>

<h3><a href=""http://academyofhawaiianarts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ABOUT US<br/></a></h3>
<p>The Academy of Hawaiian Arts (AHA) is a 501(c)3 non-profit
organization and performing arts school in Oakland, California. A hula halau
(dance school) led by the vision of its Kumu Hula (teacher of hula), AHA offers
hula classes for dancers of all ages. AHA also offers classes in Hawaiian music
('ukulele and singing) and workshops in Hawaiian crafts. </p>
<p>Since its inception in 2003, the Academy of Hawaiian Arts
(AHA) has been carrying forward the vision of its founder, Kumu Hula Mark
Keali'i Ho'omalu. With the support of AHA's kumu hula, instructors and many
volunteers, AHA is able to carry out its mission to cultivate and evolve the
cultural arts of Hawai'i, including dance, music, language, poetry, and
composition, as well as a venue for the enhancement of knowledge. The vision of
the Academy is articulated in the opening words of our Mission Statement: We
are stewards of Hawaiian heritage.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1228194/files/20150217065606-AHA_Wahine-MM2014_Kahiko_-_Kimo.jpg?1424184966"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p>The Academy of Hawaiian Arts continues to grow and to forge
new traditions of hula, chant and song. Since its inception, we have (1)
established classes for children at levels from beginning to advanced; (2)
created classes for adults in both performance and recreational hula at levels
from beginning to advanced; as well as (3) started a music ensemble class where
‘ukulele and singing instruction combine with the study of contemporary and
traditional Hawaiian songs. Throughout this time, we have continued to maintain
our goal of keeping the past alive while creating the present — the legacy of
the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1228201/files/20150217065829-kane_kahiko__2_.JPG?1424185109"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>AHA
 has a long history of being a premiere dance company. In addition to 
competing in the Merrie Monarch several times, we have also toured Japan, Hawai'i, Southern California, and most recently performed at the San 
Francisco Ethnic Dance Festival. Our performance has earned us a 
nomination from The Isadora Duncan Dance Awards Committee for the 
“Izzies” 
for the 2013–­2014 performance season in the category ""Outstanding 
Achievement in Performance - Company."" The winners
 will be announced and honored in an awards ceremony to be held March 
23, 2015 in San Francisco. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1188954/files/20150201182242-AHA_Kane__Auana_MM2014-Kimo.jpg?1422843762"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p>As a non-profit organization, we create our own avenues for fundraising on an ongoing basis. Grants, workshops, performances, food booths at festivals and many events at the halau are all part of our fundraising efforts.  </p>
<p>Kumu Mark &amp; the Academy of Hawaiian Arts has been invited to compete at the prestigious 52nd Annual <a href=""http://www.merriemonarch.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Merrie Monarch Festival</a> in Hilo, Hawaii. It is an honor to be selected as one of very
few participating halau outside Hawaii and the sole school from Northern California. Our team includes 45 kane (men) and wahine
(women) who will go to Hilo to participate. From airfare to lodging to
transportation to costumes, the journey's expense breaks out to almost $90,000. Per dancer, $2,000 is formidable to each dancer, many who are students, young adults, and parents with families. We would like your help to defray some of the costs of the
costumes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1188972/files/20150201183705-AHA_Wahine__Auana_MM2014-Kimo.jpg?1422844625"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hula costuming and adornment making is an extraordinarily intricate process requiring meticulous planning, in-depth research and knowledgeable resources. Paying homage to tradition, accurate interpretation and good mana (energy) are all part of hula costume and adornment creation. As part of the learning and training experience, every costume is hand-sewn by the dancers. Costumes not only adorn the dancers in beauty, but are representative of so much more: depicting the era the mele (song) was written; illustrating resources available during the time the story took place; demonstrating geographical location connected to the song; colors of the island from where the hula originates; vegetation of the 'aina (land) woven into adornments. As you can imagine, it takes much thought from our Kumu and dancers to find the perfect blend of aesthetics, meaning, appropriateness, and quality. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1188963/files/20150201183100-combo__2_.jpg?1422844260"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our goal through this project is to raise $5,000 towards costuming. While this is just a portion of
the total costs, it would grant us the
ability to create costuming that truly represents the hard work, dedication and sacrifice put forth by AHA to participate in this competition. Participating in the Merrie Monarch is a highly respected opportunity, one that most hula dancers can only dream of. Your contributions will help us put our best foot forward among some of the best hula halau in the world, representing our culture and making our community proud.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1188966/files/20150201183152-wahine_kahiko__3_.jpg?1422844312"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Costs for costuming:</b></p>
<p>The Academy of Hawaiian Arts will be presenting four performances at the Merrie Monarch; two dances each by the Wahine (women) and Kane (men) teams. Each dance requires its own costume suitable for the theme and time period of the song being performed.</p>
<p>Wahine:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>$1,200 </b>in fabric for hula skirts in the style of the late 1700s. </li>

WE'VE SET A STRETCH GOAL OF $12,000 AND ADDED NEW PERKS!!!
WE MET OUR GOAL BECAUSE OF YOU!! We are overjoyed at the
outpouring of love and support that has taken us on this ride of fundraising
via crowdfunding. We set our goal at $5,000 because we wanted to be realistic —
to dip our toes into the uncharted (for us) waters by creating a campaign that
would be of interest both to our longtime supporters, and to people just
discovering AHA.
As you’ve likely read in our campaign story, the costumes alone for our
Merrie Monarch trip will cost us well over $15,000. So we intend to keep going
strong for our final 8 days — through midnight March 19 — and set a stretch
goal of $12,000.

There are still so many reasons to reach out to contribute. Showing your love
for AHA and the perpetuation of the Hawaiian culture is just the beginning. 

You could choose a cool, fun perk. And we
decided to add some new perks to give you some different options to consider,
such as:


$50 Video Shout Out from the
     Airplane AHA Dancers will shoot
     a video shout-out to you on the plane to the Merrie Monarch — you never
     know what you’re going to see with a bunch of excited dancers heading to
     Hawaii!


$60 Day of Rehearsal Stage photo We get a very short
     window of time to rehearse at Edith Kanaka’ole Stadium, and you will be
     one of the very first to receive in your inbox a digital photo from our
     AHA photographer, Uncle Kimo (James Doiron, Inā Hawai’i), the only non-MM
     photographer who will have the privilege of photographing AHA rehearsing
     on stage


And
remember that we will still be updating the Private Blog that already exists at
the $100 level. So there will be a lot of fun photos and video clips that you
will be able to access while we are in Hilo. We're picturing messy dorm rooms,
lots of eating of food, and maybe negotiations over the limited number of
outlets in our rooms.
So go ahead - choose your perk - and let’s
crush this!

Mahalo nui for your continuing support!


ABOUT US
The Academy of Hawaiian Arts (AHA) is a 501(c)3 non-profit
organization and performing arts school in Oakland, California. A hula halau
(dance school) led by the vision of its Kumu Hula (teacher of hula), AHA offers
hula classes for dancers of all ages. AHA also offers classes in Hawaiian music
('ukulele and singing) and workshops in Hawaiian crafts. 
Since its inception in 2003, the Academy of Hawaiian Arts
(AHA) has been carrying forward the vision of its founder, Kumu Hula Mark
Keali'i Ho'omalu. With the support of AHA's kumu hula, instructors and many
volunteers, AHA is able to carry out its mission to cultivate and evolve the
cultural arts of Hawai'i, including dance, music, language, poetry, and
composition, as well as a venue for the enhancement of knowledge. The vision of
the Academy is articulated in the opening words of our Mission Statement: We
are stewards of Hawaiian heritage.


The Academy of Hawaiian Arts continues to grow and to forge
new traditions of hula, chant and song. Since its inception, we have (1)
established classes for children at levels from beginning to advanced; (2)
created classes for adults in both performance and recreational hula at levels
from beginning to advanced; as well as (3) started a music ensemble class where
‘ukulele and singing instruction combine with the study of contemporary and
traditional Hawaiian songs. Throughout this time, we have continued to maintain
our goal of keeping the past alive while creating the present — the legacy of
the future.


AHA
 has a long history of being a premiere dance company. In addition to 
competing in the Merrie Monarch several times, we have also toured Japan, Hawai'i, Southern California, and most recently performed at the San 
Francisco Ethnic Dance Festival. Our performance has earned us a 
nomination from The Isadora Duncan Dance Awards Committee for the 
“Izzies” 
for the 2013–­2014 performance season in the category ""Outstanding 
Achievement in Performance - Company."" The winners
 will be announced and honored in an awards ceremony to be held March 
23, 2015 in San Francisco. 

As a non-profit organization, we create our own avenues for fundraising on an ongoing basis. Grants, workshops, performances, food booths at festivals and many events at the halau are all part of our fundraising efforts.  
Kumu Mark & the Academy of Hawaiian Arts has been invited to compete at the prestigious 52nd Annual Merrie Monarch Festival in Hilo, Hawaii. It is an honor to be selected as one of very
few participating halau outside Hawaii and the sole school from Northern California. Our team includes 45 kane (men) and wahine
(women) who will go to Hilo to participate. From airfare to lodging to
transportation to costumes, the journey's expense breaks out to almost $90,000. Per dancer, $2,000 is formidable to each dancer, many who are students, young adults, and parents with families. We would like your help to defray some of the costs of the
costumes.

Hula costuming and adornment making is an extraordinarily intricate process requiring meticulous planning, in-depth research and knowledgeable resources. Paying homage to tradition, accurate interpretation and good mana (energy) are all part of hula costume and adornment creation. As part of the learning and training experience, every costume is hand-sewn by the dancers. Costumes not only adorn the dancers in beauty, but are representative of so much more: depicting the era the mele (song) was written; illustrating resources available during the time the story took place; demonstrating geographical location connected to the song; colors of the island from where the hula originates; vegetation of the 'aina (land) woven into adornments. As you can imagine, it takes much thought from our Kumu and dancers to find the perfect blend of aesthetics, meaning, appropriateness, and quality. 

Our goal through this project is to raise $5,000 towards costuming. While this is just a portion of
the total costs, it would grant us the
ability to create costuming that truly represents the hard work, dedication and sacrifice put forth by AHA to participate in this competition. Participating in the Merrie Monarch is a highly respected opportunity, one that most hula dancers can only dream of. Your contributions will help us put our best foot forward among some of the best hula halau in the world, representing our culture and making our community proud.

Costs for costuming:
The Academy of Hawaiian Arts will be presenting four performances at the Merrie Monarch; two dances each by the Wahine (women) and Kane (men) teams. Each dance requires its own costume suitable for the theme and time period of the song being performed.
Wahine:


$1,200 in fabric for hula skirts in the style of the late 1700s. 

$4,000 in fabric, boning, and zippers of two fitted tops. 


$3,300 in fabric for hula skirts (two per dancer) for a dance dating to the mid-20th century.

$225 for notions used in construction of the costumes, including thread and elastic.

Kane:



$800 in fabric, thread, buttons and construction costs for Aloha shirts for use in a dance dating to the modern era. 

$1,200 for dress shirts, pants and vests representing the Hawaiian Monarchy period of the late 1800s.

Additional costume costs:


$6,080 for floral materials (such as native Hawaiian ferns and flowers) and construction costs of lei (Hawaiian garlands) -- each dancer will use between 2 and 6 lei per performance.


$700 for pu'ili (split bamboo rattles), hand-held instruments which will be used by the dancers during two performances.



As you can see, the costume costs are estimated to exceed $17,000.

</div><div>
<p>We are insanely excited about the possibilities of <strong>INTERSECTIONS</strong>. It serves our mission in such a palpable way and we know we can make an enormous impact.

<h3>What will all this accomplish?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>In our first year, we will be testing the waters with a smaller sampling of <strong>INTERSECTIONS </strong>communities (we are aiming for a total of four week-long immersions). These audiences will all be exposed to classical theater and performance through our uniquely contemporary lens. We aim to give everyone we come in contact with a chance to personally interact with Shakespeare and find a sense of ownership; there are way too many people in the world who have either never seen Shakespeare performed, or seen it as a remote, stuffy thing and been turned off by it. We will change their minds.</p>
<p>As we grow into the future, we are planning to find funding sources that will allow us to go into communities that may not be able to afford this kind of exposure. In the next several years, we'd love to have multiple <strong>INTERSECTIONS </strong>teams creating art and cultivating experiences all over the country.</p>
<p>We know that this project will not only get people thinking about Shakespeare, theatre, and performance in new ways; we believe it will also invigorate communities and stimulate engagement between local schools, libraries, artists, and businesses after we’ve come and gone. We just have to get it up and running.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Know this is BIG!</h3>
<p>As with everything we do at NYSX, we are taking some huge risks. <strong>INTERSECTIONS </strong>is a great expansion of our business in terms of logistical complexity, and we are discovering the challenges as we go. One of the first is making contacts in our target communities: we are committed to a week in Bryan, Texas in March, and have feelers out in other Texas communities, as well as in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, and upstate New York. But we know that not all of those will pan out; discovering new communities and refining our pitch process will be integral to making <strong>INTERSECTIONS </strong>have the impact it deserves. Please consider making a contribution today. Together we can share some of the artistic love that is so embedded in the New York community.

Our mission is to popularize Shakespeare for new, diverse, contemporary audiences in unexpected ways. Throughout our first seven years, there are four main ways we've pursued this mission:



Full Productions -- Our fresh takes on Shakespeare's plays and new Shakespeare-inspired works from Resident Playwright Kevin Brewer are ""proof that Shakespeare, in all his complex glory, is alive and well in New York City."" (Huffington Post, 2016)photo: Titus Andronicus, 2015 (Kalle Westerling) 


ShakesBEER, NYC's Original Shakespearean Pub Crawl-- These free-wheeling Shakespeare events for newbies and nerds alike are a perfect introduction to the Bard and a refreshing reminder that classical theater can be a helluva lot of fun. 



The Sonnet Project -- This ambitious cinema project engages more than a thousand artists to create short films of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets at historic locations, and share them through mobile technology and online with audiences all over the world.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Here Lies Joyland IndieGoGo page!</p>
<p>I'm Darrington Clark, and my co-producers Mitchell J. Ward and Hannah L'Abri Miller are at the head of Here Lies Joyland - a new play we are producing for the KC Fringe Fest this year. Hannah, Mitchell and I are all Kansas State University Theatre graduates; we all first met and collaborated at school. Now we are excited about the opportunity to collaborate professionally, and on a new work: Mitchell is our playwright, Hannah is directing and I am acting in our piece.</p>

<p>Joyland was an amusement park in Wichita, KS and was once the state's premiere attraction. Shut down in 2006, now the campus of the park is decrepit, decaying and very possibly haunted, if you believe in that sort of thing. The location inspired Mitchell (native of Colwich KS and very familiar with Joyland in its former glory and current abandonment) to write a horror-play about the deserted amusement park. Our play is a ghost story, an attempt to explore the convention of terror on live stage, and most importantly, a bold endeavor to put our own artistic voices into the Kansas City theatre community. To put it simply, we're doing a passion project, and we need help to bring it to fruition.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have set a fundraising goal of $800. This is based on a budget projection that includes marketing/advertising, costumes, set and props (creating the right vibe for a haunted, abandoned amusement park), as well as rehearsals space and the cost to participate in Fringe in general.</p>
<p>Hannah, Mitchell and I all willingly went into the project assuming we would not make money back, and funding <strong>WILL ONLY </strong>be returned to us if we can successfully pay all our expenses and offer payment to our actors and crew. It is important to us, as producers &amp; artists, to compensate the people we have asked to do this project with us as a favor; it is not important to us to make every cent we put into this back.</p>
<p>By contributing to us, you contribute to a new work in the making! Your support aids us here as well as all future endeavors and productions of this piece. From a thank-you in our show program to seeing our final product free of charge, we are offering several gifts in return for your support.</p>
<p>Again, any money we receive is going to pay our practical expenses first. If we don't reach our goal, all of the funding received will have gone to the expenses of producing a brand new play.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If this project is successful for us, it is successful for our careers, our city and our development as artists and professionals. As the play develops, we wish to see it performed and produced on an even higher professional scale. We're working within Fringe limitations, so an unlimited budget and immeasurable space are not items on the table. The more we develop, the more Here Lies Joyland will resemble the way it is suppose to look and feel. We will keep all our backers updated on the progression of the piece you've helped us create!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We're artists - we understand not being able to throw money any which way. You can help us with our goal in several ways</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're local, come see our play!</li>
<li>The biggest marketing tool for Fringe is word-of-mouth. We think our play is pretty cool. If you think the idea is too, talk to others about it, come as a group!</li>
<li>You can share this page to make it more visible to more people - the more the merrier!</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Thank you so much for sticking with us through this. We really appreciate your support. We're here because we believe arts can change the world.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary</h3>
<p>NPG is a global NYC-based theatre collective formed to create <strong>experimental</strong>, <strong>imaginative new performance works.</strong> NPG is a revolving collective of theatre artists founded by South African director Kim Kerfoot and Thai-Australian artist Anchuli Felicia King. NPG stands for North Pacific Gyre - an oceanic gyre in the Pacific ocean and the largest ecosystem on Earth. NPG represents our approach to making theater; <strong>porous</strong>, <strong>global</strong> and <strong>migratory</strong>. Like the NPG, we collect artistic ""debris"" through our symbiotic collaborative process. Like a gyre, we float through new spaces, cities and forms.</p>
<p>As an ensemble we are interested in finding new ways to tell stories, explicitly through translation and transformation onstage - using both spoken languages and multidisciplinary languages of performance. Our work is designed to be:</p>
<p><strong>Portable</strong>: Returning to a model of performance that is accessible to all.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible</strong>: Both form and content that adapts to any circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Multidisciplinary</strong>:  Our troupe members have experience and expertise in disciplines ranging from Norwegian Folk Music to Augmented Reality, and we will use them all to tell the best story possible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our Campaign</strong></p>
<p>In both our process and production, NPG strives to create a <strong>communal</strong> <strong>storytelling space</strong>, a figurative hearth, long table, or bonfire. Only by returning to such a space can we can begin to explore the relationship between listener and storyteller (audience and performer) through a text that is over a thousand years old, that reaches back to the beginnings of the English language itself, and which grew out of an oral tradition of poetry and storytelling.</p>
<p>We are not trying to resuscitate a  thousand year-old story but rather we seek to create a new vehicle through which this story can be shared. <strong>Portable</strong>, <strong>irreverent</strong>, <strong>self-aware</strong> and yet deeply connected to and fascinated by the material, we aim to tell this story come hell or high water, with any and all means at our disposal. Praise poetry, puppetry, Norwegian choral folk music, dance, mime, physical theatre and the language of Beowulf itself.</p>
<p>We want to create a different kind of Communion. A place of order protected from the chaos of the outside world, to remind ourselves that though death is ever-present, some things live on.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Your Contribution</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>CATWALK Art Residency</strong> is an invitation-only artist residency program in Catskill, New York. The Beowulf project was awarded a three week residency in April to develop and create the production. At the end of the residency we will have a presentation of our work so far.</p>
<p>Your contribution will enable us to support the team's individual living expenses while away from their jobs on residency, covering rent and minimal expenses, as well as transporting the company to the residency.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need <strong>$7300</strong> to cover the 8 person team’s individual living expenses for 3 weeks. In order to get the team out of the city and away from their survival jobs for three weeks, we need to cover their rent and minimal expenses.</p>

<p>Both as a collaborative team and as individuals we have taken projects from initial workshop development phases like this through to successful productions and ongoing projects. Two early NPG projects, Anchuli Felicia King's <i>Orientalism </i>and Kim's <i>Einstein's Knee </i>are great examples of this. After a successful workshop performance,  <i>Orientalism </i>was accepted to Manhattan Theatre Rep's Spring New Play Festival in 2016, while <i>Einstein's Knee </i>was developed into a site-specific immersive play, <i>Wrecked</i>, at the National Theatre of Croatia Ivan pl.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div><p><a href=""http://18thandunion.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">18th &amp; Union</a> is a creation of Seattle's <a href=""http://radialtheater.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Radial Theater Project</a>. Since its inception in 2011, Radial Theater Project has produced new and innovative works by local and international theater artists, and created the <a href=""http://radialtheater.org/locally-grown"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Locally Grown</a> performance festival. 18th &amp; Union will be a home for Seattle's solo and other portable performers, and for exhibits of work by Seattle-based photographers and painters.</p></div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've gotten started with private funding, but now need your help to establish 18th &amp; Union as a vital community asset. Our initial costs have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a new nonprofit corporation that will operate the space</li>
<li>Signing a new three-year lease and setting up utilities with all required deposits</li>
<li>Rebuilding seating risers for a wonderful audience experience</li>
<li>Adding air conditioning for audience comfort during Seattle's warmer months </li>
<li>Redesigning the lobby</li>
</ul>
<p>Money raised during this campaign will be used to pay back some of these expenses, and to establish a fund to pay ongoing costs (rent, utilities, and so on) as we get 18th &amp; Union started.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>When you donate to 18th &amp; Union, you'll know you've helped create a sustainable place for the arts in Seattle. But we also have some gifts to offer! These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media shoutouts</li>
<li>Tickets to shows at 18th &amp; Union</li>
<li>Your name inscribed on the wall, and even on tech equipment</li>
<li>Your name displayed on our preshow lobby display</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Art space is harder to come by with every high rise and crane that pops up in our city's skyline. Seattle's artists need space to rehearse, perform and, most importantly, try new things and even fail. 18th &amp; Union is dedicated to preserving this awesome art space and keeping it in the hands of the artists who need it most. We envision an artistic playground that's financially accessible to artists, letting them maximize their artistic risk without breaking the bank. </p>
<p>Furthermore:</p>
<ul>
<li>18th &amp; Union is in a neighborhood with (relatively) easy parking.</li>
<li>18th &amp; Union seats 48 audience members comfortably, and has a spacious lobby.</li>
<li>18th &amp; Union will host exhibits of visual art by Seattle-based photographers and painters.</li>
<li>and...18th &amp; Union has air conditioning for summer-time comfort! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're unquestionably hitting the ground running. In just its first three months, 18th &amp; Union will present at least seven different productions, and will be host to many other events. And it's being done with a nearly all-volunteer staff.</p>
<p>The good news is that the creators of 18th &amp; Union have a wealth of experience to draw on. David Gassner, Producing Director, was Artistic Director at Theater Schmeater from 2007-2009, and has led many other artistic organizations. Blair Feehan, Managing Director, has worked in arts administration for some of Seattle's most respected organizations, including On the Boards and Seattle Repertory Theatre. And the rest of the staff--designers, marketers, volunteer organizers--similarly bring great backgrounds to this project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are many other ways to help get 18th &amp; Union started. Help us get the word out: share this campaign on social media, and tell people about the project. We need volunteers for everything from ushering at shows to helping keep the space clean. But mostly, we hope you'll come to 18th &amp; Union to see the work: solo and other portable performance, created and presented by extraordinary artists.</p>
<h3>Want Your Donation to be Tax-Deductible?</h3>
<p>18th &amp; Union is already a Washington State nonprofit corporation, but it'll take us some time to achieve IRS 501(c)(3) status. In the meantime, we've partnered with Fractured Atlas, a national organization that supports folks at every level of the cultural ecosystem. Contact us for more information on making tax-deductible donations through our fiscal sponsorship with Fractured Atlas.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Charleston City Ballet’s Rumpelstiltskin is a family friendly ballet that slightly updates the fairytale of Rumpelstiltskin. We have added the character of the Prince, the love interest of the Miller’s Daughter to clear up some of the plot devices in the original tale. For example, in the original story the King threatens the Miller’s daughter with her life to make the gold, yet she marries him and has a child. We see the King as a selfish dictator who does not love anything other than wealth and prestige. On the other hand, the Prince is kind and really does love the Miller’s Daughter. Rumpelstiltskin is very much a creature who is clever, mischievous, only thinks of himself and the tricks he can play. We believe this creates the right balance of characters to create a funny yet interesting story that all can enjoy. Charleston City Ballet prides itself on mixing great story telling, dance, and the theatrical arts. Our goal is to draw you in to the story and to have the rest of the world drift away.  </p>
<p>The leadership of the Charleston City Ballet brings the grand Russian tradition of storytelling and dance to the city of Charleston and its communities. Michael and Olga Wise both had prestigious careers with The Moscow Classical Ballet. They strive to bring the traditions, training, and quality that Russian ballets have done for centuries to every performance they create. Students and dancers from all over the world come to Charleston to work with them</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<li>We need to raise funds to support the staging of our ballet performance of Rumpelstiltskin for the Piccolo Spoleto Festival 2017 in Charleston, SC.</li>
<li>All contributions will go directly to offset the costs of staging the production.</li>
<li>For your contribution, you will get access to some unique perks and the eternal gratitude of the only classically trained ballet in Charleston, SC!</li>

Rumpelstiltskin is very much a creature who is clever, mischievous, only thinks of himself and the tricks he can play. We believe this creates the right balance of characters to create a funny yet interesting story that all can enjoy. Charleston City Ballet prides itself on mixing great story telling, dance, and the theatrical arts. Our goal is to draw you in to the story and to have the rest of the world drift away.  
The leadership of the Charleston City Ballet brings the grand Russian tradition of storytelling and dance to the city of Charleston and its communities. Michael and Olga Wise both had prestigious careers with The Moscow Classical Ballet. They strive to bring the traditions, training, and quality that Russian ballets have done for centuries to every performance they create. Students and dancers from all over the world come to Charleston to work with them

What We Need & What You Get

We need to raise funds to support the staging of our ballet performance of Rumpelstiltskin for the Piccolo Spoleto Festival 2017 in Charleston, SC.
All contributions will go directly to offset the costs of staging the production.
For your contribution, you will get access to some unique perks and the eternal gratitude of the only classically trained ballet in Charleston, SC!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>In this tragic and true story, Heloise and her lover, the philosopher Abelard, hope to advance the power of reason, but they must confront a brutal medieval world.</p>
<p>Most historians focus on Abelard, the philosopher, but few of them focus on Heloise, his great love. Our story highlights the mind and will of Heloise<i>—</i>a rare female voice from the medieval world that is more modern than one might expect.</p>
<p>We are grateful for any help you might offer so we can produce the story of Heloise.</p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong></p>
<p><i>Heloise is a young woman when she meets Peter Abelard—the most famous philosopher of 12th-century France. He is shrewd, ambitious, and politically threatening to conservatives of the Church. But her family then exacts a terrible revenge. The tale of Heloise and Abelard is one of the world’s great love stories, but it is also a philosophical story, because the two lovers press a crucial question with great force against the Church: the proper relation of reason to faith.</i></p>

</div></div>","INTRODUCTION
In this tragic and true story, Heloise and her lover, the philosopher Abelard, hope to advance the power of reason, but they must confront a brutal medieval world.
Most historians focus on Abelard, the philosopher, but few of them focus on Heloise, his great love. Our story highlights the mind and will of Heloise—a rare female voice from the medieval world that is more modern than one might expect.
We are grateful for any help you might offer so we can produce the story of Heloise.
SYNOPSIS:
Heloise is a young woman when she meets Peter Abelard—the most famous philosopher of 12th-century France. He is shrewd, ambitious, and politically threatening to conservatives of the Church. But her family then exacts a terrible revenge. The tale of Heloise and Abelard is one of the world’s great love stories, but it is also a philosophical story, because the two lovers press a crucial question with great force against the Church: the proper relation of reason to faith.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><u>The Show</u></p>
<p>In the aftermath of her father’s death, a young woman revisits their past conversations to seek advice and remember his legacy. This is her true story of grief, self discovery, coming of age, and womanhood.</p>
<p><u>The Process</u></p>
<p>When I was 19 and home on Thanksgiving break from my freshmen year at college, my father was dying of colon cancer. One Monday evening, he went to the hospital, and my mother told me his time was near and that the next day he said he needed to talk with me. The next morning, I woke up and found out he had died. I never knew what he wanted to talk with me about. I never got to have a last conversation with him. This show centers on this theme of what that last conversation could have been. </p>
<p>Later that summer, I was an intern with the Ojai Playwrights Conference and began to write about him, and then the inspiration for this show hit. At Kenyon College, I finished writing the first draft and performed a stage reading of the show to a fully sold out crowd and received a standing ovation. After graduation, I began to rewrite and edit, and held small readings of the play in Portland, Los Angeles, and Washington DC to receive additional feedback and notes. </p>
<p>Three years after the starting to write, I am pleased to announce the show will have a run at Capital Fringe this summer. </p>

The show will be performed at the new Renegade Studios in Vancouver from May 6th – 12th 2013.
RTC has previously produced (in Vancouver) the hit show, A Shpadoinkle Musical Tribute. This was a tribute of songs to the writers Matt Stone and Trey Parker. It was sold out beyond capacity, and patrons continue to ask us for more. We’d like to comply! Gee Willikars, Space! promises to be hilarious with amazing songs that you’ll want to take home with you.

<p>Have you ever had an accidental orgasm in the shoe department? Or wondered when Uggs and flip-flops became acceptable dinner attire? In a world full of options, why do we opt to cope rather than celebrate? And how do we navigate our obsession with finding True Happiness? Perhaps it begins one pair of impossibly high stilettos at a time.</p>
<p>I’ve spent the last year developing and work-shopping a full-length version of my solo show, and am absolutely thrilled that I have a spot in the Toronto and Vancouver Fringe Festivals this summer! I’ve been gearing up for Vancouver since I got my spot in December, but just found out about Toronto 2 weeks ago (eek!)—and the festival is fast approaching. So I need your help to get me there! The next few months are going to be very busy; the Toronto Fringe runs July 3-14, then I’m back in New York for a spell and hoping to put the show up for a few nights in August, with Vancouver Fringe running September 5-15. With my production team in Toronto and me in New York, there are a lot of incidental and administrative expenses that are adding up, in addition to the big festival fees. Here are the specifics:</p>

<p>I started writing this show about women and cynicism and fabulous shoes over 5 years ago at the tail end of the Bush years— I wanted to write through the chaos and malaise and find a little bit of joy, a little humor, a little excuse to get together with an audience and have a good time sharing our misery. Plus—let’s be honest, I was sick of people treating me like a bimbo because I live in high heels. I’ve stepped away from the show for years at a time, but somehow keep getting drawn back. In a way, it feels we’re living at a time even more chaotic and unsettled now than we were at the end of the last decade. It’s really hard for me to turn the news on, and even harder for me to turn it off. And on top of everything, I feel I’m facing this constant battle about what it means to be a Real Woman—from Sheryl Sandberg and Hilary Clinton to the Kardashians to Beyonce to the too-many-to-name rape and assault victims being blamed and harassed even to the point of suicide—everywhere I look I see women either being  boxed in, or ripped to shreds any time they try to step outside a box. This is my little attempt to step outside.</p>

<p>Watch Me Productions is pleased to be remounting ""Eyes of the Enemy"" by Chris W. Cook.  After several successful fringe runs of the show, Watch Me Productions is partnering with Amnesty International to bring this dark, poignant, and increasingly relevent show to the Living Room Playhouse (Azimuth Theatre) June 27-29. </p>
<p><br/> By teaming up with Amnesty International, Watch Me Productions hopes to continue it's efforts to raise awareness and encourage discourse surrounding the use of and tacit approval of torture by Canada and its allies.</p>
<p>Watch Me Productions began preliminary work on <em>Eyes of the Enemy</em> in 2007.  Starting with research into the so-called “enhanced interrogation” methods used by NATO and its allies overseas.  We explored different ways to present these practices theatrically and <em>Eyes of the Enemy</em> soon began to take its present form. The stories of Maher Arar, Omar Kadr, and others demonstrate the brutality shown to Canadian citizens and the seeming complicity of the Canadian and American governments in these acts of torture.  We felt a calling to explore these issues on stage.  <em>Eyes of the Enemy</em> is a work of fiction, but is also a commentary of where we believe our country and our global society are headed. The slamming of Canada’s human rights record in 2011 by Amnesty International shows us an interesting and new era in Canadian history; one where torture is not unilaterally condemned, but under certain circumstances, condoned.  This is an alarming reality.</p>
<p><em>Eyes of the Enemy</em> premiered at the 2011 Calgary International Fringe Festival and was produced again at the 2012 Edmonton International Fringe Festival to stellar reviews.   4.5 stars in the Edmonton Journal and several sellout performances combined with very positive community feedback from both runs led Watch Me Productions to embark on this remount of <em>Eyes of the Enemy</em>.</p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What We Need</span></h3>
<p>We are asking for help in fundraising for this show for several reasons.  Firstly, Watch Me Productions has committed to donating 30% of our gross profits from this run to Amnesty International Edmonton.  We want to maximise the amount we can give Amnesty....so that's why we're asking for help.  If we can reach our campaign goal we can completely cover our production costs.  If those costs get covered, that means more money can go into the coffers of Amnesty.</p>

<p>Secondly, Watch Me is taking ""Eyes of the Enemy"" to the Vancouver International Fringe festival in September.  Any remaining profits we have after paying out to Amnesty will go directly towards helping us get out west.</p>

We believe that we are at our most powerful when we stand together for human rights.  Each person, no matter who or where they are, can make change happen by acting in concert with others who share their vision of a world where everyone lives in dignity.
Members are the strength of our organization.  It is because so many people speak out for justice that Amnesty International is able to achieve remarkable things.
Amnesty International is an authoritative voice on human rights.  For over 50 years, we have provided the world with reliable and accurate information about human rights violations and international human rights laws and standards.
Amnesty International is independent of any government, political ideology, economic interest or religion.  We do not accept funding for our human rights research and campaigning work from any government.  Our work is supported by donations from individuals.
Amnesty International is impartial.  We hold all actors to the same obligations as defined in international human rights law and standards.  Our only goal is to ensure human rights are respected for everyone, everywhere",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hi, I'm Nicola McEldowney: puppeteer, actress, playwright and onetime denizen of the Customer Service Desk at the supermarket. That last one was so far the best career move I ever made.</p>
<p> Why, you ask? Because AISLE SIX, my musical based on the experience, has now made it into a fabulous pair of theatre festivals this summer! To wit:</p>

<p>I'm beyond excited to work with two dynamite casts, and one evil puppet. But, to do so, I need funding! Currently, Aisle Six's entire capital comes from my personal pocket, which is all well and good (I love this musical more than I can possibly say) but also pretty ineffective (I have less money than I can possibly say).</p>
<p>Aisle Six, at this juncture, is the most important thing I have ever done. It is imperative that I be able to make it grow with new productions - new actors, sets, props and lights - and above all, new AUDIENCES. You will be helping me to bring my proudest accomplishment to life.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Chris Coculuzzi and Roxanne Deans are Toronto-based artists that have worked together for twenty years. They are currently collaborating on projects that promote women as subjects rather than objects.</p>
<p><em>Piecing Together Pauline</em> is a new herstorical drama about opera singer Pauline Garcia Viardot (1821-1910): a charismatic personality and performer who was arguably the foundation for the modern artist and career woman.</p>
<p><em>Piecing Together Pauline</em> will premiere at the 2012 Toronto Fringe Festival, featuring Genie Award and Actra Award nominee Elva Mai Hoover and Kristen Zaza sharing the title role. The show also includes performances by Bil Antoniou, Tara Baxendale, Rob Candy, Stephen Flett, Damien Gulde, Chris Irving, Alex Karolyi, Scott McCulloch, Shannon Shura, Brenda Somers, Steve Switzman, and Blake Thorne playing notable artists of the day, including George Sand, Frederic Chopin, Charles Gounod, Hector Berlioz, Ivan Turgenev, Maria Malibran and Ary Scheffer.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<em></em>While keeping the production values simple, <em>Piecing Together Pauline</em> is a large cast, period play. Your donations will help defray the cost of the following:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Costumes, Set and Properties</li>
<li>Rehearsal space fees</li>
<li>Printing of promotional material</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why You Should Give</h3>
Perhaps the strongest moral reason for this play now is not in the particular story of Pauline Viardot, but in the universal telling of a story with a strong female protagonist as subject and not as object. It is a sad truism that women are continually objectified in media and theatre is no exception. If nothing else, Pauline Viardot is a strong female role model for men and women. The men that fell in love with Pauline did so because of her intellect and artistic abilities and definitely NOT for her features. Where are such female role models today? More importantly, where and what in the culture is promoting such concepts of womanhood?</div>

<strong> Help an Extremely Talented Young </strong><strong>Dancer                      Achieve her Dreams!</strong><strong> </strong><strong>                             </strong>
</h2>
<p>She is 15 years old and has dedicated her life to dance. She has had the support and love of her family, wonderful teachers, and the community throughout her journey. She continues to grow with each year, but has now reached the upper limits of what she can achieve here in our small town of Ashland, Oregon. Over the last 8 years she has generously received a full scholarship at her present dance studio based on need, ability, and dedication. We want to see her continue to shine, but we will need the help and support of the community to provide her with the opportunity that she needs to move forward!  </p>
<p>         </p>
<p>The next step is stepping up her training to a professional level. Along with this comes the inevitable move for our close knit family of 4 from our small Oregon town to the land of dreams and opportunity...Southern California! We are ready to move (into a small apartment if needed) in order to give Nashalah a chance to train, get into a performing arts high school, and expand her possibilities to that of a professional dancer's reality! Additionally, being in this environment she will be able to take advantage of opportunities to attend professional dance events that expose her to the dance industry on a more personal level.</p>

<p>She has a gift! Help give her the opportunity to cultivate her natural given talent and become the best possible dancer she can be! This will not only create a future for her, but will also create an outpouring of goodness back into the world through the joy and emotion she gives through her performances. In addition to her dreams as a professional dancer,she hopes to one day teach non-profit dance classes to children in need, nurturing their passion for dance and artistic expression. Help give wings to pursue her lifelong journey with dance...She will soar!</p>

<p>For those that don't know me, my name is Monica Rounds and I am a New York City based actor carving my path in this crazy business. I grew up in the t.v. generation loving all things tv &amp; film, dreaming of being of part of it but never really knowing where to start. I am the child of a career military serviceman which, unbeknownst to me, was setting me to be able to immerse myself in different worlds. I went down the typical path of high school then headed off to college but knew I was not your typical gal. Something was missing and so began my quest! From the moment I stepped on the stage the 1st time I knew that this was what I was meant to do!Moving to New York six years ago was a big step for me. I have made some excellent strides but as we all know, life sometimes intervenes and takes you on a path you may not have expected. So at the beginning of this year I set out to achieve some lofty goals to continue in the pursuit of my passions. One of those was to apply/audition for the Williamstown Theatre Festival. The Summer Theatre Festival <a href=""http://www.wtfestival.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wtfestival.org</a> (for those who may not know) is very prestegous and offers an artist the opportunity to work with some of the best in the business through stage work, classes, and production work both on and off stage!</p>
<h3>The Impact/What I Need/What You Get</h3>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I received the exciting news that I had been accepted into the Aprrentice Program for Williamstown! That's 9 weeks of be immersed in all things theatre in the Bershires of Massachusettes! Then reality kicked in. The program is not cheap; $4000 to be exact but I know (and several friends have reiterated) that this is an opportunity that I've been given and should not pass up! The $4000 is for room/board, classes &amp; training, meals, and housing. The Universe is aligning things in my favor, but I still have a long way to go. I am working extra shifts at both my jobs (yes, every actor has 12 jobs otherwise we go crazy!) to raise as much money as I possibly can to cover what I need for the tuition &amp; extra expenses. Here's where you can help. I'm not asking for a lot; just give up one latte. ONE LATTE to help an artist pursue her dreams. Even if I don't reach my goal, I am still able to keep anything contributed. No donation is too small and every dollar raised is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Because this is such a unique opportunity, I want everyone to be a part of my experience!</p>
<p>For any donation up to $25 you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>My heartfelt gratitude expressed through an individualized email</li>
<li>Bi-weekly updates on my progress, activities, &amp; festival news</li>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><em><strong>The Way of Water</strong> </em>is a play that pits the BP 
oil spill next to the lives of those affected by it. It's a story about 
four people making do as best they can, living their lives, and just 
trying to stay afloat in the land of many compromised dreams, as the 
devastation of a to-this-day mostly under-reported health crisis scandal
 in the Gulf is played out on a human scale. It's a play about poverty 
in America, rumors and truth, what is said and what gets written, and 
the quest for an honorable life.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>NoPassport theatre alliance and press in collaboration with multiple 
venues across the US and abroad present free readings of the play 
in the month of April 2012 to mark the two year anniversary of the BP 
oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and raise awareness in regards to human 
health and environmental damage issues as a result of the Deepwater 
Horizon disaster.</p>

<h2>
	Why a Reading Scheme Now? <br/>
</h2>
<p>NoPassport theatre alliance and press is committed to the 
advocacy, promotion, production and publication of creative expressions 
of diversity and difference in theatre and performance. It is also 
committed to interventionist actions through theatre-making in culture 
toward peace, healing, forgiveness, positive action, and resistance to 
uncivil actions.</p>
<p>The effect on human health on residents in the Gulf of Mexico region,
 as result of excessive use of toxic dispersant and toxic rain during 
the BP oil spill clean-up, has resulted in thousands of reported 
illnesses and deaths, and hundreds of lawsuits against BP that have yet 
been resolved.</p>
<p>Awareness to the effect on health, way of life and living, 
endangerment to livelihood of commercial fishermen, and the increased 
fragility of indigenous and Creole communities in the region is part of 
this schemeâ€™s community-action goals.</p>
<p>How can theatre transform and speak poetically to our lives? How can 
we let art live within us and see our world anew? How to continue to 
engage civically in the nexus between art and practice and life?</p>
<p>NoPassport asks these questions with any conference, reading, 
publication , open mic or scholars symposium it forges into action. The 
same is true with this scheme.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
The Way of Water is a play that pits the BP 
oil spill next to the lives of those affected by it. It's a story about 
four people making do as best they can, living their lives, and just 
trying to stay afloat in the land of many compromised dreams, as the 
devastation of a to-this-day mostly under-reported health crisis scandal
 in the Gulf is played out on a human scale. It's a play about poverty 
in America, rumors and truth, what is said and what gets written, and 
the quest for an honorable life.

NoPassport theatre alliance and press in collaboration with multiple 
venues across the US and abroad present free readings of the play 
in the month of April 2012 to mark the two year anniversary of the BP 
oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and raise awareness in regards to human 
health and environmental damage issues as a result of the Deepwater 
Horizon disaster.











	Why a Reading Scheme Now? 

NoPassport theatre alliance and press is committed to the 
advocacy, promotion, production and publication of creative expressions 
of diversity and difference in theatre and performance. It is also 
committed to interventionist actions through theatre-making in culture 
toward peace, healing, forgiveness, positive action, and resistance to 
uncivil actions.
The effect on human health on residents in the Gulf of Mexico region,
 as result of excessive use of toxic dispersant and toxic rain during 
the BP oil spill clean-up, has resulted in thousands of reported 
illnesses and deaths, and hundreds of lawsuits against BP that have yet 
been resolved.
Awareness to the effect on health, way of life and living, 
endangerment to livelihood of commercial fishermen, and the increased 
fragility of indigenous and Creole communities in the region is part of 
this schemeâ€™s community-action goals.
How can theatre transform and speak poetically to our lives? How can 
we let art live within us and see our world anew? How to continue to 
engage civically in the nexus between art and practice and life?
NoPassport asks these questions with any conference, reading, 
publication , open mic or scholars symposium it forges into action. The 
same is true with this scheme.










What We NeedWe are attempting to raise $2,500 to cover travel expenses and production costs for the reading series.  As of now, we are relying entirely on public support for the base costs of putting together a nationwide project.  With readings in major cities all over the US, we hope to reach as many people as possible, and to do this we need your help.

Other Ways You Can HelpPlease inform others about the reading series in April! We are continuing to add venues across the United States, THE

LIKE CRAZY EXCITED!!!  (since it is now official) that I will be performing in a mounting of the one man show ""THE NIGHT LARRY KRAMER KISSED ME""  by David Drake this JUNE!  This was a show performed 20 years ago, off-Broadway, by David Drake himself.   It tells the story of his call to gay pride and activism through a series of vignettes exploring thoughts and emotions shared by a whole generation of gay men and women.  In 2000 it was made into a film.  For the past year and a half, I have been working closely with two newly formed theatre companies here in Chicago called GLITTERATI PRODUCTIONS (<a href=""http://glitteratiproductions.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://glitteratiproductions.com</a>) and PRIDE FILMS AND PLAYS (<a href=""http://pridefilmsandplays.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://pridefilmsandplays.com/</a>).  These theatre companies are still very new (2 years old) and at a very grassroots stage of development.  Through a series of staged readings, caberet fundraisers, and two full-length productions (performed in very small cabaret and bar theatres that were free or charged next to nothing), we have managed to put our company on the map.  In October, I approached a director from the company about joining forces in mounting a 20 year anniversary production of this one man show.  The theatre company members were skeptical that the piece was dated or not relevant enough for our time and our instant-gratification culture.  I invited them to hear me read/perform the play out loud for the board of directors and any ensemble members that wished to attend.  This happened on March 10th.  On that day, I heard the board say things like...""this is going to make you a star.  This could be such a big thing.  This is worth bringing back.  People need to hear this story again.""  Since March 10th I have been working my ass off, double shifts, scouting out theatre venues, and just plain pounding the pavement.  The good news is we booked a theatre, but not for free. Zach (my partner) and I saved our funds and put a deposit down on a theatre before we even had the rights.  After seeing the theatre, both theatre companies realized that it is important to our development to push some of our productions into real theatres with real theatre seats and make a handful of our productions more legit.  THE NIGHT LARRY KRAMER KISSED ME is that inaugural production.  With David Drake's blessing, and a brand new ending penned by Mr. Drake my partner Zach and I have pledged that we will raise $3,000 dollars toward an over $6,000-$8,000 budget for the show.</p>
<p>So, yes, you guessed it, Ineed you to help.  You consist of those that have in some way inspired me to continue to be myself and chase my dreams.  You can help in many ways.  You can help by buying a ticket to the show which is the best way.  And then tell your friend to buy a ticket, or better yet, buy a ticket for you and a friend and then come again or tell other friends.  You can also help by donating money to help us pay for the theatre, the advertising, the stage management, the rights, the legal fees.  Your donations helps pay for a lightning designer, set designers, costumes, props, promotional materials, rehearsal space, equiptment just to name a few.   If you can't come to Chicago to see the show, spend the $20 toward a donation and support an artistic endeavor that is near and dear to my heart and hopefully after this campaign...near and dear to yours. </p>
<p> I urge you to see why I am so excited to perform this piece.  It's a tour de force.  A one-man passion play.. I am passionate about this project not only because of the challenge it will pose for me as an actor but also because of the relevant material that even 20 years later is still important. But, beyond that, I think it is important to tell the story of this community and how we had people before us that fought to make life as easy, breezy and beautiful as it really is right now.  This play makes we want to make some noise.  Because, I truly believe, we still need to make some noise to keep on getting to where we are going. </p>
<p> If you choose to donate at $1, or $10, or $20  it doesn't matter, all is appreciated greatly.  If you choose to donate $100, or $500 or $1,000 we should talk about putting your name in the playbill, maybe even sponsorship.  Either way, I am reaching out now and will continue to reach out until June 19th when I need to shut down my indiegogo page and open the show for it's first preview performance  Consider it.

  Murakami Music: Stories of Loss and Nostalgia                                                               Saturday November 1st, 2014 at 8PM                                                               Engelman Recital Hall, Baruch Performing Arts Center

Created by pianist Eunbi Kim, in collaboration with actress Laura Yumi Snell, and director Kira Simring, Murakami Music is a performance piece inspired by the works of contemporary Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami, an author whose books have been translated into fifty languages, and sold millions of copies. His works reference classical music, as well as popular music, jazz and blues.
Murakami Music has been lauded and featured on Japanese television network, FujiTV, and most recently profiled in the documentary, ""The World Reads Murakami,"" on NHK, Japan's national public broadcasting organization.
A dramatic work, this program includes performances of piano works with theatrical readings that explore the complexities of the lives behind the pianists in Murakami's books including Sputnik Sweetheart, Kafka on the Shore, and Norwegian Wood.



Summary
 RESOBOX- ""The place where people who are conversant with, dedicated to, and influenced by Japanese arts can gather, create innovative arts through the collaborative processand disseminate them to the world.""
Due to popular demand (sold-out performances at Symphony Space and The Cell Theatre), Murakami Music is thrilled to work with RESOBOX, a Japanese cultural center based in Queens, NY, to present another special NYC performance in the beautiful Engelman Recital Hall at The Baruch Performing Arts Center. With excellent acoustics and a spectacular stage setting, it's sure to create another unique and unforgettable experience for audience members. Read a past review here.    What We Need & What You Get We are raising funds to offset production costs and to provide artist fees for all the hard-working, talented, and creative people involved in this passion project. Ticket sales alone rarely cover all the expenses for a performance, such as printing and designing programs and materials, the space rental, technical lighting, artist fees, etc. 
In return, we invite you to our VIP Reception Party, a RESOBOX cafe date complete with their famous matcha latte and sushi, backstage access and open rehearsals, and a private house concert for you and all your friends. 

  The Impact By contributing, you are making a major impact for-


The Arts (music, literature, theatre, Japanese culture)
Women and Minority Artists- it is rare to see an Asian-American female lead in a theatrical production that does not involve any racial stereotypes. 
Social Causes- We delve into one of the most universally taboo topics, mental illness. 

Writings of Haruki Murakami- Murakami writes about alienation, loss, nostalgia, and more themes that we hope to inspire audiences.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Theatre After Secrets is a group of young theatre artists from Toronto, Canada with big imaginations. We are writers, actors, dancers, musicians, and designers - creators and interpretors. By exploring the relationship between text, movement and sound, we make original work, and adapt existing works; investigating the human condition to reveal truths and subvert assumptions.</p>
<p>We are gathering funding for our first project entitled Knuckle Down, which we have been working on over the passed year. Now we want to perform it! But we need your help.</p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are fundraising for a 5-night run in Toronto, as well as to cover our costs for production. Any amount is sincerely appreciated. Our goal for this online campaign is $500.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Theatre After Secrets originated from a desire to tell poignant and essential stories that explore what it means to be human in social, cultural and personal contexts. We seek to reveal what lies at the core of each and every one of us; our desires, fears, dreams – by picking apart the exterior layers brought on by time and experience that cause a person to be the way that they are.</p>
<p>We go after the secrets hidden deep within that instigate a journey, not only for ourselves but for our audiences. Through the theatre we make, we encourage and challenge our audiences to think critically but also receive openly, and take their own journeys toward a deeper understanding of themselves and those around them.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Arial;"">After a successful reading The Workshop Theater Company, a legitimate
Off-Off-Broadway company in its fifteenth season, decided to add
Rumpelstiltskin to their 2012 season. This charming 55 minute childrenâ€™s
musical marries a beautiful score by composer Steve Marzullo and lyricist
Amelia Demayo with a witty book by Deb Roberts. Rumpelstiltskin retells the
classic Grimm tale highlighting themes that are easily accessible to children
in a way far more joyous then its darker counterpart. Our production is scheduled
to run from February 11 till March 5. Additional information can be found at
<a href=""http://www.workshoptheater.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.workshoptheater.org</a> </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 17px;"">Rumpelstiltskin will be the inaugural production of the Workshop Theater
Companyâ€™s Youth Theater Wing, a department which aims to develop a full season
of youth theater pieces to augment its existing programming, thus creating a
performance home for professional children. It is our hope that the success of
this production will spark other program development for other theaters as well
creating numerous strongholds for child performers throughout the city.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>

</div></div>","Our Story


After a successful reading The Workshop Theater Company, a legitimate
Off-Off-Broadway company in its fifteenth season, decided to add
Rumpelstiltskin to their 2012 season. This charming 55 minute childrenâ€™s
musical marries a beautiful score by composer Steve Marzullo and lyricist
Amelia Demayo with a witty book by Deb Roberts. Rumpelstiltskin retells the
classic Grimm tale highlighting themes that are easily accessible to children
in a way far more joyous then its darker counterpart. Our production is scheduled
to run from February 11 till March 5. Additional information can be found at
www.workshoptheater.org 



The Impact
Rumpelstiltskin will be the inaugural production of the Workshop Theater
Companyâ€™s Youth Theater Wing, a department which aims to develop a full season
of youth theater pieces to augment its existing programming, thus creating a
performance home for professional children. It is our hope that the success of
this production will spark other program development for other theaters as well
creating numerous strongholds for child performers throughout the city.


What We Need & What You Get


The money raised through this campaign will be used to provide the best
production we could hope to accomplish. Funds will be used not only for the
design elements such as scenic construction and lighting, but also for renting
rehearsal space that is safe and convenient for actors.

But as we look to the new year, The Howland Company is looking to connect and bring you lots of laughter from home! This #GivingTuesday please consider a donation to our new live-streamed adaptation of our ""Best of Toronto Fringe"" and Canadian Comedy Award nominated hit, Entrances and Exits (created by Ruth Goodwin and Liz Johnston) and help support Canadian theatre artists this winter. </p>

The show was subsequently remounted in 2019 at Bad Dog Theatre, and was invited to Toronto’s Sketch Fest--Canada’s premiere comedy showcase, before garnering a Canadian Comedy Award nomination.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Collette Campbell and I am a New York based actor and performer. I was hired as an acting apprentice for Portland Playhouse in Portland, OR for the 2015-16 season. At the end of my apprenticeship I had the opportunity to create and perform a one person show about 10 minutes in length. <strong><i>Home, Sweet, _____ </i></strong>was born from the feeling of homesickness being so far from my home in New York for a year. I collaborated with Brooklyn musician Sean Skahill and he wrote an original score for the show and recorded it. It was been performed in New York twice since, at Dixon Place for the Bindlestiff Family Circus's Open Stage Variety Night and in the Emerging Artist Theater's New Works Spring Festival at Tada! Theater with Sean performing his music live by looping several instruments. </p>
<p>It has always been my dream to bring my original one woman clown show that I love so dearly to fringe festivals across the nation and beyond. FringeNYC is one of the largest, most competitive, and most critically acclaimed fringe festivals in existence. To have been invited to perform this beautiful piece in my very own home, sweet, home is incredibly humbling. Participation fees for this festival have proven to be quite expensive and in the past artists have greatly benefited from the generosity of patron's donations. Your contribution would help my show be recognized in a huge way and help me as an artist finally break into the fringe world and be a part of a really special community. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Participation, insurance, equipment, marketing materials, etc. are all a huge part of the cost of putting up <strong><i>Home, Sweet, _____ </i></strong>at FringeNYC.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Help us put on a great production of a brand new musical version of A Christmas Carol - but with a difference - set in current times, but with all the usual male roles in the Dickens tale now women - a female Scrooge named Carol, a female Tiny Tim named Trina, a female Jacob Marley and three female ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future.  The book is by Doug Haverty, an  award-winning playwright, and the music and lyrics are by Bruce Kimmel, who also directs - he is an award-winning songwriter and director.  The show opens on November 16 and plays through the end of the year.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $10,000.  The Group Rep has been around for decades and done a lot of wonderful theatre.  Putting on a big new musical is beyond their usual means so we need this money to cover those extra costs that come with producing a musical, i.e. the musical director and most importantly a sound package for the theatre, which has nothing in terms of sound.  We are using orchestral tracks that are being created by our musical director Richard Allen, who is doing brilliant work on them.  The sound package includes a lot of rentals - mixing board, mics, speakers, etc. and it's a seven-week run - and we also have to pay a sound operator to actually run the show.  We are being given a great rate but we need the money to cover it.  Just to know how great a rate, the musical Bruce Kimmel directed last year, the world premiere of Levi by the Sherman Brothers, had a sound budget of $16,000 and that was only for a two-week run.</p>
<p>We've come up with some really fun perks - tickets to our opening weekend, which include a pre-show private reception and after-party - we're basically doing three opening nights and you can choose which performance you'd like to attend on the opening weekend.   There are also Group Rep season tickets at a considerable savings, you can be an associate producer or an above the title producer, you can get a special thank you in the program, and we have other fun and unique stuff - signed items, a cast album, a private coaching session with Bruce Kimmel, a personally designed Christmas card for you especially by Doug Haverty, and lots of other great stuff.</p>
<p>The first two days of any Indiegogo campaign are the key days and set the tone for the campaign.  Therefore it is very important we do really well on the first two days, so if you can contribute and choose your perk on those days that would be incredibly helpful.  Also, please spread the word to your nearest and dearest 10,000 friends on social media, especially musical theatre fans.  Let's make this thing trend!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal (although we hope we will!), all the money we do make goes directly to the musical and sound needs of the production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In these crazy times, having a positive, fun, and moving new musical that makes people feel good about life and decisions is so important.  The ultimate goal is to create a holiday show that can play all over the world - and having a show with so many great female roles is something we really wanted to do.</p>
<p>In the past, we've had great success funding campaigns for new musicals - last year it was Levi! A New Musical about Levi Strauss, written by the Sherman Brothers - we not only funded, we went considerably higher and we were able to do an amazing production of that show that is now leading to other productions.  The year before it was for a new musical revue about Los Angeles, L.A. Now and Then, and we funded considerably over our goal for that one, too.  In each of those cases, all the money went to the musical and sound needs of the show, just as it will here.</p>
<p>So, with your help, we want this show to have an amazing birth - all the people who contributed to our other campaigns loved their perks, loved being part of the birth of new musical theatre projects, and we simply try to make it fun and exciting for everyone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges are, of course, budgetary.  Small 99-seat theaters are always struggling with budgets and making their seasons happen.  The Group Rep is an award-winning theatre company, one of the oldest in Los Angeles.  They have not done many musicals due to the cost factor, but the handful they've done have been very successful.  We're hoping this new feel-good holiday musical will get full houses and help their coffers for their future seasons.  The risks are easy - a new musical is always challenging, but we are up to those risks and challenges.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>We understand that money can be tight so if you can't afford to contribute, please spread the word and share this campaign with all your nearest and dearest.</p>

<h3>ThE PlaY</h3>
<p><strong>WHAT IS PANCAKE DAY? A messy, silly, honest, remarkably bare night shared between two best friends and a stranger. There is Hawaiian pizza. There is reality TV. There are dance routines. There are fireworks. </strong></p>
<p>Pancake Day is an explosive piece of new writing from innovative British playwright Miriam Battye, and we are thrilled to give it its American premiere! </p>
<p><u>OR:</u></p>
<p>Ella and Zoe are best friends. Matty is a stranger they hire from Craigslist for the night. What ensues is a series of planned (and, eventually, unplanned) activities the girls have devised to digest and process a decision. They include role play, choreographed dance routines, and hawaiian pizza. And amidst all this is Matty. From Craigslist. </p>
<p>Pancake day is a play about being young: the confusion, the loneliness, and the manifested sense of purpose. It’s hilarious. It’s heartbreaking. It has its finger completely on the pulse. It is a show that desperately needs to be seen. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>WhY Pancake Day</strong></h3>
<p>Pancake Day presents an honest look at our relationships in a way that is rarely given space onstage. It's ridiculous, funny, heartbreaking, and completely representative of how confusing it is to be a person. </p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>We are an international company committed to exploring new work! As Pancake Day grapples with ideas of communication, we are excited to investigate how language changes across the Atlantic. Working closely with a dramaturge, we are adapting the text of Zoe and Matty to fit the landscape of New York without removing any of the punch and grit of the original dialogue. Through this, we can emphasize the themes of division and perspective that are at the heart of this compelling comedy.</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>This is such an exciting opportunity to bring sizzling international work to the US. Writer Miriam Battye's new play will be premiering at The Royal Court in London next year, and we are thrilled to be the first American company to bring her characters to life. </p>

<p>                    Hello!! Our names are Lauren Coccaro, Mariah Elle Kane, and Dylan Bivings, and the three of us are artists; primarily actors, but we’re also singers, writers, dancers, etc. We have come together as the first students in a series of workshops by MTEAF’s and Triple Threat Theatre's very own industry professionals, Maria Torres and Dee Kanevsky, respectively. <strong>Part of our learning in this workshop is to produce.</strong> In the wake of Covid-19, Dee and Maria’s mission of this Creative Workshop is to provide equal prospects to artists who don’t have the advantage or opportunity to produce their own work.</p>

</div></div>","Hello!! Our names are Lauren Coccaro, Mariah Elle Kane, and Dylan Bivings, and the three of us are artists; primarily actors, but we’re also singers, writers, dancers, etc. We have come together as the first students in a series of workshops by MTEAF’s and Triple Threat Theatre's very own industry professionals, Maria Torres and Dee Kanevsky, respectively. Part of our learning in this workshop is to produce. In the wake of Covid-19, Dee and Maria’s mission of this Creative Workshop is to provide equal prospects to artists who don’t have the advantage or opportunity to produce their own work.

<p><strong>WHO WE ARE: COMMON PEOPLE</strong><br/><br/>We are two emerging dance artists, <strong>Andrew Hartley</strong> and <strong>Emma Kerson</strong>, who have come together to create <strong>Common People</strong>, a collective to support our creative voices.  We are looking to create work that is relevant to our artistic community as well as society at large.  We are asking ourselves questions about identity.  Who are we as individuals?  Who are we together?  What is the role of an artist within society?  We believe that we have a responsibility to be honest: to use our voices to accurately reflect who we are.</p>

<p>We are raising money to produce <strong>Blue Valentine</strong> as part of <strong>Coleman Lemieux &amp; Compagnie’s <a href=""http://colemanlemieux.com/portfolio/blue-valentine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bright Nights</a></strong> series.  This show is the culmination of three years of focused work. <br/> </p>

<p>We began by commissioning talented young choreographer, <strong>Simon Renaud</strong>.  We chose Simon because he possesses an articulate and personal voice; his work is unlike anything else being presented in Toronto.  He is a creator with a vivid imagination and the skill to bring his vision to life.  He has a keen eye for detail; every moment of his choreography is thoughtfully considered.  His duet, <strong><i>l’inanité des bibelots / love would only slow me down</i></strong>, is slow, simple, and visually striking with a deeply emotional undercurrent.<br/> </p>

<p>The second duet on the program, <strong><i>Songs and Tarps</i></strong>, comes from <strong>Tedd Robinson</strong> who has mentored Simon’s choreographic work for the better part of a decade.  Simon’s choreography has evolved from Tedd’s mentorship and shares the same trademark visual strangeness.  We asked Tedd to create a piece in response to Simon’s in order to create an evening where the audience will gain a stronger appreciation of each piece when viewed one after the other.  Tedd chose to create a duet much more tangled with song and sound, physical contact, and yet similar questions of identity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU'LL BE SUPPORTING</strong></p>
<p>We have been very fortunate to receive strong support in each of the three years of this show’s life from both the Toronto Arts Council and the Ontario Arts Council, but we still need to raise <strong>$2000</strong> in order to produce a show of this scale with integrity.  Expenses for a production like this include: rehearsal space, theatre rental, costumes and props, sound and lighting equipment, documentation, as well as artistic fees for the choreographers, rehearsal directors, sound and lighting designers, and us, the dancers.  It is an expensive venture, but we feel the work of these two choreographers deserves to be highlighted in a professional capacity.  Every little bit will help us achieve our goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS TO BE INVOLVED</strong><br/><br/>If you're unable to contribute financially, here’s how you can still make a meaningful contribution to support our initiative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help get the word out and <strong>make some noise</strong> about our campaign!  You can easily share a link to this page with friends and fellow dance and art lovers from your <strong>Facebook / Twitter</strong> accounts or in a personal email. </li>

to throw more of the great events that you’ve known us for (i.e. campouts,
undergrounds, renegades, etc..) However, before we can move forward with
planning future events, we need to pay off our debt and bring our Burning Man containers home from storage in Gerlach. We
need to raise about $6,000 to cover our storage debt ($2,500), container
transport ($1,500), and debt owed for emergency transportation after one of our
trucks broke down on the way to playa in 2013 ($2,000). </p><h1>Here's the deal....</h1><p></p><p>We’ve done some amazing things over the past 15 years. Want
It started from humble beginnings at Burning Man as a tiny camp on the outskirts
of the city. We
grew our BM camp with hard work, perseverance, and love to become a favorite
playa destination where we served the masses delicious music, sushi, and
cocktails. Over the past dozen+ years, we also started a radio show, threw
unforgettable undergrounds/fundraisers, and hosted three campouts. </p><p>This is the point where most camps break up. They thank each other for a good run and move on with their lives. Not us. We are fucking solid. And we're committed to rocking together as a community. But we can’t move forward with more awesome things until we resolve our debts. We want nice things. You want nice things.

year off from the playa and, after careful consideration, realize we are not going
back to BRC again anytime soon. With that being said, we still have intentions
to throw more of the great events that you’ve known us for (i.e. campouts,
undergrounds, renegades, etc..) However, before we can move forward with
planning future events, we need to pay off our debt and bring our Burning Man containers home from storage in Gerlach. We
need to raise about $6,000 to cover our storage debt ($2,500), container
transport ($1,500), and debt owed for emergency transportation after one of our
trucks broke down on the way to playa in 2013 ($2,000). Here's the deal....We’ve done some amazing things over the past 15 years. Want
It started from humble beginnings at Burning Man as a tiny camp on the outskirts
of the city. We
grew our BM camp with hard work, perseverance, and love to become a favorite
playa destination where we served the masses delicious music, sushi, and
cocktails. Over the past dozen+ years, we also started a radio show, threw
unforgettable undergrounds/fundraisers, and hosted three campouts. This is the point where most camps break up. They thank each other for a good run and move on with their lives. Not us. We are fucking solid. And we're committed to rocking together as a community. But we can’t move forward with more awesome things until we resolve our debts. We want nice things. You want nice things. Will you help Want It bring back nice things??....

<div>We are Scene One Theatre, located in Athens, Ohio. We're really just a passionate group of theatre nutcases who love putting on family-friendly musicals and plays. This August, we are doing the hit Off-Broadway production, <i>Frankenstein: A New Musical, </i>directed by Matthew Johnson, and we need your help! <br/><br/><h3>What is this show about? </h3>
</div>
<div>Frankenstein! This is a powerhouse musical that very closely follows the classic novel by Mary Shelley, yet remains fantastically innovative. Victor Frankenstein is a brilliant young scientist who embarks on a quest to discover the secret of life, creating a human of his own design that turns out instead to be a horrifying creature. This is no 'Hollywood monster,' but a flesh and blood man who, while terrifying in appearance, grows to become articulate, cunning, and thirsting for revenge upon the creator who abandoned him. It is a tragic love story, an exploration of humanity, and a thrilling tale of man and creator pitted against one another in epic battle. <br/><br/><h3>What do we need?</h3>
</div>
<div>All of the money we raise goes toward things we need for the show, like costumes, props, set materials, etc. We don't pay our staff or actors, so any money made is funneled into the show. This campaign is set up with a goal to raise at least half of expenses. With your help, we can present the awesomest (that's right...I said awesomest) production of Frankenstein, A New Musical! Our breakdown of total expenses is as follows: </div>

 key force that drives our new interpretation of the play will be the 
influence of fame. The power that our royalty have, the power that 
Claudius kills for, is the power that comes from fame or celebrity 
status (think an amped up version of Will &amp; Kate). We will flash 
newspaper articles, magazine covers, and twitter updates to give the 
audience additional information about the world the characters are 
living in and how they are viewed by the public. Hamlet has been in this
 place of fame since birth. Everything she does is scrutinized. When she
 puts on an “antic disposition”, or plays mad, she will be clearly 
playing this to the public. <br/><br/>Right out of the gate Hamlet brings into question the difference between
 what “is” and what “seems”. In our modern western culture, a culture obsessed with
 beauty and power, we are often encouraged to believe that what is seen 
on the surface is what matters most. Hamlet challenges this idea of superficial reality and digs to discover the truth. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/725843/files/20140717195907-Screen_Shot_2014-07-17_at_7.58.51_PM.png?1405652347"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><i>Check out the Gallery for our cast bios :)</i><br/><br/>An obvious change from the classic play is that our Hamlet will be… a woman.  We believe this keeps integrity with the original message and plot of the play. It will inevitably charge the character relationships with a different kind of energy and context allowing the audience to experience the character, and the characters around her, in a fresh light. <br/><br/>In addition to changing Hamlet’s gender, we will also be gender swapping Laertes, Rosencrantz and Marcello (now Marcella). <br/><br/>We are fiercely committed as a company to expanding and exploring the voices of females in the arts and in our society. We feel that allowing the audience to view a woman navigating Hamlet’s famous struggle will not only be an enjoyable and exciting experience to witness, but will be ultimately be a positive and valuable exercise for all involved.<br/><br/><br/><b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/725845/files/20140717200023-Screen_Shot_2014-07-17_at_8.00.02_PM.png?1405652423"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/725720/files/20140717183112-Screen_Shot_2014-04-10_at_4.33.05_PM.png?1405647072"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/725861/files/20140717201454-Screen_Shot_2014-07-17_at_8.14.17_PM.png?1405653294"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>In order to realize this ambitious production, we need to raise $20 000. This will go into the cost of supplies for set construction, wardrobe, makeup (and makeup artist), props, lighting (and lighting technician), sound design (and sound mixer), projection equipment, video production costs, printing of scripts and posters, and cast/crew honorariums. This is our estimation for a low budget production. If we exceed this goal, there are many items we left out of our budget that we would be able to include.<br/><br/>We will be working with a co-op agreement between all the cast and crew.

We work together as directors on our films. Although our careers are pointed in the film direction, we are taking this time to go back to our roots and direct a stage production. In the future, we hope to complete a film adaptation of Hamlet as well.<br/><br/>Raised in a household where his plays were used as bedtime stories, we have grown up to be strong believers in Shakespeare’s ability to timelessly explore the delicacies of the human condition. From age five (when we first allowed our dad to read us A Midsummer Night’s Dream because there were fairies in it) we have been fans of Shakespeare. We started acting in Grade 2 and attended Tir-na-nOg Theatre School on Bowen Island for many years. It was at that school when we got our first introduction to Hamlet. Amazingly, at thirteen, we and other students in Grade 8/9 were given the opportunity to perform the entire play. Being exposed to the play at a young age made us realize that Shakespeare’s Hamlet is not meant to be placed on a pedestal to be kept out of reach. The themes it addresses and the situations the characters are faced with are universal. <br/><br/>The more time we spend with this play the more we are taken by it’s profound contemporary relevance.

Staying true to the original dialogue, the intention is that our contemporary take will not skew the heart of this iconic tale, but rather help awaken and refresh the character dynamics, struggles, and poetry that have made this piece the timeless classic it is today. So shall you hear of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, of accidental judgements, casual slaughters, of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause, and in this upshot, purposes mistook fall'n on th'inventors' heads.All this can we truly deliver.What kind of a world would a popular young Prince grow up in today?A
 key force that drives our new interpretation of the play will be the 
influence of fame. The power that our royalty have, the power that 
Claudius kills for, is the power that comes from fame or celebrity 
status (think an amped up version of Will & Kate). We will flash 
newspaper articles, magazine covers, and twitter updates to give the 
audience additional information about the world the characters are 
living in and how they are viewed by the public. Hamlet has been in this
 place of fame since birth. Everything she does is scrutinized. When she
 puts on an “antic disposition”, or plays mad, she will be clearly 
playing this to the public. Right out of the gate Hamlet brings into question the difference between
 what “is” and what “seems”. In our modern western culture, a culture obsessed with
 beauty and power, we are often encouraged to believe that what is seen 
on the surface is what matters most. Hamlet challenges this idea of superficial reality and digs to discover the truth. Check out the Gallery for our cast bios :)An obvious change from the classic play is that our Hamlet will be… a woman.  We believe this keeps integrity with the original message and plot of the play. It will inevitably charge the character relationships with a different kind of energy and context allowing the audience to experience the character, and the characters around her, in a fresh light. In addition to changing Hamlet’s gender, we will also be gender swapping Laertes, Rosencrantz and Marcello (now Marcella). We are fiercely committed as a company to expanding and exploring the voices of females in the arts and in our society. We feel that allowing the audience to view a woman navigating Hamlet’s famous struggle will not only be an enjoyable and exciting experience to witness, but will be ultimately be a positive and valuable exercise for all involved.In order to realize this ambitious production, we need to raise $20 000. This will go into the cost of supplies for set construction, wardrobe, makeup (and makeup artist), props, lighting (and lighting technician), sound design (and sound mixer), projection equipment, video production costs, printing of scripts and posters, and cast/crew honorariums. This is our estimation for a low budget production. If we exceed this goal, there are many items we left out of our budget that we would be able to include.We will be working with a co-op agreement between all the cast and crew. Each person will keep track of their hours and we’ll divide any profit depending on hours put in. If we exceed our goal we will be able to better compensate our talented team! This is one of the reasons your contribution would be so greatly appreciated!If you are unable to donate money, here are other great ways in which you can support our production:                                                                                                                Facebook                                                                                      Twitter:  @KaileySpear @SamSSpearThank you so much!!

We work together as directors on our films. Although our careers are pointed in the film direction, we are taking this time to go back to our roots and direct a stage production. In the future, we hope to complete a film adaptation of Hamlet as well.Raised in a household where his plays were used as bedtime stories, we have grown up to be strong believers in Shakespeare’s ability to timelessly explore the delicacies of the human condition. From age five (when we first allowed our dad to read us A Midsummer Night’s Dream because there were fairies in it) we have been fans of Shakespeare. We started acting in Grade 2 and attended Tir-na-nOg Theatre School on Bowen Island for many years. It was at that school when we got our first introduction to Hamlet. Amazingly, at thirteen, we and other students in Grade 8/9 were given the opportunity to perform the entire play. Being exposed to the play at a young age made us realize that Shakespeare’s Hamlet is not meant to be placed on a pedestal to be kept out of reach. The themes it addresses and the situations the characters are faced with are universal. The more time we spend with this play the more we are taken by it’s profound contemporary relevance. Hamlet is a young person, isolated by fame and responsibility, seeking the best possible path to justice and redemption while grappling with themes of love, family, loyalty, good and evil, revenge, death, and well… everything that makes life such a crazy trip. For years now we have been nurturing and developing our dream to mount a version of Hamlet in Vancouver. We are so excited that our dream has now been set in motion!Thank You Bill. We endeavour to make you proud.And thank you all for your support!

odyssey of her own. Join Laurentina on an adventure that might just 
awaken your own magical abilities.
Acclaimed performer, playwright, and improv extraordinaire Lauren Stein is taking her latest play, Laurentina's Oddyssey, on the road (well, actually, to the skies) to Australia and New Zealand.

You now have the opportunity not only to see this famous play in action, but also to be a part of that dream.

<h2>OzCabaret ...our story</h2>
<h3><em>Chapter I</em></h3>
<p>Once upon a time, back in 2007, three lovely ladies and one tall young man packed up their lives and headed to the humble seaside city of Mackay in QLD to seek their fortunes and study the craft of performing arts at the Central Queensland Conservatorium of Music.</p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s10.postimg.org/794y0ogyh/CQCM.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>

<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was here that the four became friends and after three years of honing their skills they each left to find their way in the big wide world. Then something miraculous happened..<br/><h3><em><strong> </strong></em></h3>
<h3><em><strong>Chapter II</strong></em></h3>
<p>In 2012 the four found themselves in the same corner of Europe (the Netherlands to be exact) and, while sampling some vino one evening, decided that they should combine their passions (vino+theatre+music) and create something that the world had never seen before.</p>
<p>And so it came to be that <strong>vino + theatre + music + eachother = <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s10.postimg.org/uxkfvydhx/Logo.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></strong></p>
<h3><em>Chapter III</em></h3>
<p>The four worked hard on creating their very own spicy brand of interactive wine-tasting entertainment. They showcased their work in the Netherlands before moving to the UK and testing it out on the English crowd, all the while working hard to improve and learn and be the best that they could be.</p>
<p>They even flew their old CQCM singing teacher, Kim Kirkman, over to add his famed spit and polish to their work.<em><br/></em></p>

<h3><em>Chapter IV</em></h3>
<p>As fate would have it, Mark Fawcett from the MECC stepped up and offered the troupe an amazing opportunity to help celebrate the centres 25th Jubilee birthday by presenting the Australian premier of the Champagne Cabaret.</p>

<p>The night was a great success with fun and bubbles enjoyed by all.</p>
<p>The troupe then went on to perform an incredible sell-out season at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, receiving love from audiences and rave reviews from critics.</p>

<p> </p></div>","OzCabaret ...our story
Chapter I
Once upon a time, back in 2007, three lovely ladies and one tall young man packed up their lives and headed to the humble seaside city of Mackay in QLD to seek their fortunes and study the craft of performing arts at the Central Queensland Conservatorium of Music.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It was here that the four became friends and after three years of honing their skills they each left to find their way in the big wide world. Then something miraculous happened.. 
Chapter II
In 2012 the four found themselves in the same corner of Europe (the Netherlands to be exact) and, while sampling some vino one evening, decided that they should combine their passions (vino+theatre+music) and create something that the world had never seen before.
And so it came to be that vino + theatre + music + eachother = 
Chapter III
The four worked hard on creating their very own spicy brand of interactive wine-tasting entertainment. They showcased their work in the Netherlands before moving to the UK and testing it out on the English crowd, all the while working hard to improve and learn and be the best that they could be.
They even flew their old CQCM singing teacher, Kim Kirkman, over to add his famed spit and polish to their work.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chapter IV
As fate would have it, Mark Fawcett from the MECC stepped up and offered the troupe an amazing opportunity to help celebrate the centres 25th Jubilee birthday by presenting the Australian premier of the Champagne Cabaret.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The night was a great success with fun and bubbles enjoyed by all.
The troupe then went on to perform an incredible sell-out season at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, receiving love from audiences and rave reviews from critics.

""GRIPPING AND EMOTIONAL IN ITS DRAMATIC HIGHS AND LOWS, THE MESSAGE BEING THAT CHAMPAGNE IS FOR ALL OF LIFE, HAPPY AND SAD. THERE'S A CHARM AND PERSONAL SPACE ENTERED THAT GIVE THIS DRAWING ROOM EXPERIENCE GENUINE HEART AND SOUL.” Adelaide Now
“THE BLEND OF VIOLIN, ACCORDION AND PIANO AND POLISHED VOCAL HARMONIES BRINGS THIS SHOW TO LIFE…IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A TASTEFUL TASTE OF WINE AND SONG LOOK NO FURTHER.” All About Entertainment
 
Chapter V
Here's where you come in...
We have a tour of Europe in the pipeworks, starting with the world renowned Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We will then be heading to the Netherlands where we have been selected to be a part of the Amsterdam Fringe Festival and also the Best of the Fest in Eindhoven before making our way to England for the London Wine & Cheese Festival. We have also been invited to perform at the Macau Fringe Festival, but we have to get through this bumper schedule before we can even start thinking about taking up this great opportunity.

 
 
 
 
 
 
We're very excited to be making our debut at these wonderful festivals and to be spreading a little Aussie culture around the globe. It has been predicted by the Scotsman of the Edinburgh Evening Times that OzCabaret will be one of the top 10 picks of the Edinburgh Fringe this year: http://www.scotsman.com/edinburgh-evening-news/latest-news/edinburgh-festival-fringe-top-10-picks-1-2994355

Chapter VI
...is yet to be written because we need your help!

We promise to keep up the hard work and represent Aussies in the only way we know how, but we need some financial support to make it happen.
It is every young performers dream to play at the Edinburgh Fringe, the worlds biggest and most renowned arts festival, and with your help our dreams can come true.
The costs of getting us through this tour are unspeakable, but just to give you an idea of where it all goes here's a snapshot:

<p><strong>It cannot go on without you!</strong></p>
<p><em>He Ate Quietly into the Wall</em> has been given a two-week run at Page 22 in Chelsea, NYC, in September.</p>
<p>THE SPACE:</p>
<p>Page 22 is a performance space and classroom on West 22nd Street in Manhattan dedicated to furthering the legacy of Geraldine Page by creating a vibrant environment for emerging and established writers, directors and actors in the performing arts. Page 22 occupies the Chelsea townhouse where Ms. Page and her husband and partner Rip Torn lived and worked beginning in 1964. Currently managed by Tony Torn, Page 22 is the home of Presence 929, a professional film actors training program lead by Actor/Director Clark Middleton.</p>
<p>We have a talented group of artists working on this project for very small stipends. </p>
<p><strong>Your donation will pay for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>rehearsal space</li>
<li>stipends for the actors, sound designers, and props/set/costume designer</li>
<li>building lighting tools</li>

<p><strong>Performances on Sept. 7th, 8th, 14th, and 15th</strong></p>
<p><strong>This will be the premier of <em>He Ate Quietly into the Wall </em>and the first of Ariel's plays to have a two-week run.</strong> These plays need to be seen in full dimension to resonate. And in this theatrical climate and as a young and ""emerging"" NYC artist, it is incredibly rare to be supported with space --- Page 22 --- and time. So, this is a critical moment for the play, for Ariel's growth as producer, director, and playwright, and for nurturing the collaborative relationships that make a three-dimensional play palpable.</p>
<p><strong>A donation of any size is invaluable! </strong></p>
<p><strong>It also really helps to get the word out by sharing this link with friends who enjoy and believe in these projects.</strong></p>

Page 22 occupies the Chelsea townhouse where Ms. Page and her husband and partner Rip Torn lived and worked beginning in 1964. Currently managed by Tony Torn, Page 22 is the home of Presence 929, a professional film actors training program lead by Actor/Director Clark Middleton.
We have a talented group of artists working on this project for very small stipends. 
Your donation will pay for:

rehearsal space
stipends for the actors, sound designers, and props/set/costume designer
building lighting tools
costumes
materials for building props
boxed wine for the performances
a photographer to document the play
a filmmaker to document the play



THE PLAY:
He Ate Quietly into the Wall features Noel Joseph Allain, Jocelyn Kuritsky, Mary Rasmussen, and Alexander Wright. 
Written + Directed by Ariel Stess
Technical Direction + Design by Samuel Stonefield
Sound, Music, and Recordings by Jon Berstein and Deepthi Welaratna
Scenic Design by Abigail Lloyd
Photo by Winston Mason Riley
Poster by Walter Green
Promo Video by Maxwell Cosmo Cramer and Monroe Street


Performances on Sept. 7th, 8th, 14th, and 15th
This will be the premier of He Ate Quietly into the Wall and the first of Ariel's plays to have a two-week run. These plays need to be seen in full dimension to resonate. And in this theatrical climate and as a young and ""emerging"" NYC artist, it is incredibly rare to be supported with space --- Page 22 --- and time. So, this is a critical moment for the play, for Ariel's growth as producer, director, and playwright, and for nurturing the collaborative relationships that make a three-dimensional play palpable.
A donation of any size is invaluable! 
It also really helps to get the word out by sharing this link with friends who enjoy and believe in these projects.
Thank you so much for helping to support the show at this crucial moment. 
He Ate Quietly into the Wall attempts to get at: what it feels like to grow up and the things we played with when we were young.

<h3>Who and What is Canary?</h3>

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">CANARY is a new musical that fuses blues to bluegrass to rock'n'roll, with a few stops in between. Set in the heartland of America and seen through the eyes of four lonely teenagers, it traces the generation and regeneration of our country's music. A band might form. A banjo might break. And a young girl will hear an electric guitar for the first time. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>CANARY is for anyone who ever was or dreamed of being a part of a band, for anyone who remembers listening to Led Zeppelin for the first time, and for anyone wondering what the sound pulsing at the center of our great American mess sounds like.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>CANARY was first conceived in 2007 by Obie Award-winning director Rachel Chavkin (<i>Three Pianos</i>, Artistic Director of The TEAM), playwright/ musician Molly Rice (<i>The Saints Tour, Don't Stop</i>, book for <i>Futurity, a Musical by the Lisps</i>), and musician Ray Rizzo (Adam Rapp's <i>Finer Noble Gases</i>, Shakespeare in the Park's <i>Twelfth Night</i> and bands Less the Band, Corporal, Dawn Landes and the Hounds, Days of the New). After several rounds of development, it's ready for its final shaping and presentation in a workshop supported by Off-Broadway's New York Theater Workshop in May. NYTW's generously providing space and time to work through their Production Assistance Grant; but the Canary team needs your help in paying the actors and musicians for their work on this quirky, offbeat new play. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The artists' collaboration began with a quick coffeehouse meeting that expanded into an hours-long, amped-up conversation about 60's girl bands, ambient composition, high schools, Led Zeppelin, ghosts, Rush and the High Lonesome of bluegrass music. Unlike most musicals, Rice and Rizzo wrote the songs first, and in winter of '07, they played a concert in lieu of a play reading at the Lower East Side bar Jimmy 43. Rattlestick Playwrights Theater attended and offered them a workshop in the Summer of '08, which was a well-received jump-start. In December, Playwrights Horizons invited them to do a workshop, and since then it's been through several self-supported rounds of musical and text development. </p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>After 3 years, we believe we are entering the final leg of development-- a vital time for a new musical. We're counting on you guys to make this final step possible. Our NYTW workshop will be an opportunity to introduce this special piece to the theater community at large, and hopefully garner support for a long-awaited New York production.</p>

<h3>Why do we need your help?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We have an amazing cast, including Jane Pfitch, Charise Greene, Carlo Alban, Rebecca Henderson, and Dale Soules, along with fantastic musicians like Rizzo and Don Piper.  They love the play and are willing to work for the barest minimum, but they can't work for nothing. That's where you come in!</p>

<p>Although a lot of volunteer hours go into the making of great art, our artists have to support themselves one way or another.  Our overhead for this project is low due to the generous support of NYTW; we just need to provide fair stipends to our performers for their time and work.  Any money we bring in over the actors' and musicians' stipends we will put into paying for the recording sessions for the show's demo CD-- an important tool for shopping the show around-- which you can obtain a copy of as a perk (see below).</p>

<p>What are our potential funding sources? You're looking at it! Our fundraising efforts are focused entirely on this on-line campaign.  We don't have a sponsor (although there's a perk for that, too; see below).  So if we don't raise the money we need now, we will have to somehow make up the difference out of pocket.  Please give what you can, and know that by doing so you are helping birth a fantastic new work of musical theater.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are offering some great incentives as perks, so along with the knowledge you are helping us create great art, you could also get CD's of some of the artists' work, dinner with the creators, or even a song written specifically for you or a loved one!</p>

<h3>We are the Bearded Men</h3>
<p>We've spent the past six years doing what we love. One big thing we've realized is that sometimes doing what you love does not always make you the money you need to support that passion.</p>
<p><em>That's where you come in. </em></p>
<p>We are asking that you donate any amount that is right for you to support our past, present and especially our future projects. </p>
<h3>What's this all going to?</h3>

</ul>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation means more than we can even tell you. It will keep us ahead of the game instead of behind.</p>
<p>In particular, festivals have been one of the most exciting things for us because of the exposure, recognition and workshops we've been able to be a part of, but many times they are the most expensive thing we do. They have also introduced us to many of the people that have shaped who we are as a group today. As well as spreading the wonderfulness of the Minneapolis improv scene to the rest of the nation.</p>
<p>The more shows, no matter where, we are able to do, the more likely we are to be seen by someone who might actually want to pay us for this stuff.</p>
<p>You are funding the rocket ship, Bearded; and we're ready to blast off to the planet, MakeMoneyDoingWhatWeLove. </p>

<p></p></div>","What is TheaterFest?
Each year, for one weekend only, UCLA's School of
Theater, Film, and Television opens their doors to a series of performances
created entirely by the undergraduate theater students. 
These projects are the undergraduate
opportunity to bring to life the work we have been dreaming about for the
last year or maybe even four. 
At its core, TheaterFest is a love letter to the
UCLA TFT community— it is a response to all the things our teachers, parents
and classmates have taught us.
What We Need
Money is one of the biggest obstacles for our TheaterFest directors.
Often the director (and their parents) end up paying for their production
entirely out of pocket. Between rights and other production values, this can cost upwards of $500.
The ‘money factor’ limits which students can afford to participate in
TheaterFest and we want to change that!
This year we want to raise $2000 for the festival. This money will be
divided equally between each show to pay for:  
              1)   
The rights
              2)   
The production elements (lights, costumes, set, etc.)
AND financing productions next year!
What You Get
$10: THEATER
IS YOUR PARTY. You’re a theater person through and through! Two reserved seats for any show of your
choice.
$25: THE
DRAMATIC TENSION CLUB. You have given us the glue of every scene—the dramatic
tension! Two reserved seats for every production.
$50: THE
POETS SOCIETY. You are the original thespians, the first storytellers! Special thanks in the program and on our
website. All previous prizes also included.
$100: MUSES
CIRCLE. You are the reason for every actor’s best performances! A producer credit in the program and on our
website. A signed program from the creative teams and casts of TF. All previous
prizes also included.
$250: DIONYSUS
AND COMPANY. You are a god of the theater! A
video from the creative teams and casts of TF to thank you for your help. All
previous prizes also included.
$500: YOU ARE
ASTONISHING. You have received the highest praise of TFT: you have astonished
us! Theaters will be built in your name, legends will be formed about your
work! You will receive a book of original
rehearsal plans and notes, costume/set/ lighting sketches, notes from
production and artistic meetings AND TheaterFest’s five-year plan.
The ImpactBy
contributing to this campaign, you are making theater happen and that matters.
Please show your support and tell everyone that this is an art form that is
alive and well in Los Angeles (despite what Vanity Fair seems to think). This is
work is for you and all the inspiration that you (our teachers, parents,
friends, fellow Angelinos and citizens of the planet) bring us.

Help our merry band of actors and creative team bring our one-act comedy Petra to the stage, as we go pen-to-pen and word-to-word with 30 other plays in the Manhattan Repertory Theatre's One-Act Play Competition.
What happens when a couple can't agree on whether they once went to Petra? That's the question our dark comedy tries to answer.

<br/><h3>MORE ABOUT FANTASTIC.Z</h3></span></h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Fantastic.Z Theatre Company was founded by a few of Seattle’s LGBTQ artists who strived to bring queer arts and artists to the foreground.  They started out ensembly generating one production per year taking source material and focusing it through their queer lens. <br/><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; font-weight: normal;"">During the four years of this process their ensemble’s vision grew, leading them away from only generating their own new work and toward producing full seasons focused on both new and under produced works and reaching out to their LGBTQ and theatre community alike.<br/></span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; font-weight: normal;"">Fantastic.Z Theatre Company continually strives to amuse, amaze, entertain and inspire their community.  <br/></span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">    <br/></span></p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<h3>
</h3> </div> <div> <p>Theater is Expensive!<br/></p> <ul>
<li>One of our biggest needs are funds for rehearsal/performance space.  If you live in Seattle, you know how much it costs to keep your place.  An average production's rehearsal and performance rental can cost up to three times your monthly rent! Not to mention buying props, costumes, and sets etc.<br/>
</li> <li>Our actors, designers, and crew work hard to bring you the theatrical cocktails you've come to savor and enjoy. Your donation will help us validate their efforts. <br/>
</li> <li>All funds raised go to Fantastic Z's 2014/2015 season see detailed season info below.<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What You Get</h3>
<div>We have great perks at varied donation levels that bring you closer to Fantastic.Z Theatre Company and our art.  You also get the joy of supporting the theatre arts and joining the elite group of our contributors!</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Because of you...<br/></p> <ul>
<li>Members of the LGBTQ and Greater Seattle Community alike will learn and grow in a venue of mutual respect and interest.<br/>
</li> <li>We will deliver another year of engaging theater, education, and enrichment focused through our queer lens.</li>
<li>Your generous donation supports the growth of Fantastic Z Theatre Company and queer arts in the city of Seattle.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <p> Today, theater cannot survive without the reinforcement of its champions - benevolent people like you!  It takes a predetermined enterprise of many individuals to make a season happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every year Fantastic Z develops its resources, this is your opportunity to add to the value of Seattle's Premier LGBTQ Theatre Company. </li> </ul>

She meets and joins up with Lloyd Bophtelophti, a true ""original"" who has changed his name to avoid alimony payments and who now lives with a paraplegic named Pootie (who also pretends to be deaf in order to get double disability). Rachel then wins $100,000 on a TV game show and begins a series of picaresque escapades involving numerous psychiatrists and, eventually, an ill-fated reunion with her husband. In the end, Rachel becomes a therapist herself, treating her own child (who fails to recognize her) and is led more and more to ponder whether the modern world might not be a vast conspiracy designed to systematically undermine her own increasingly shaky sanity.</span></p>

Fantastic.Z Theatre Company is an artist run, LGBTQ, nonprofit theater company focusing on new and under produced works.
MORE ABOUT FANTASTIC.Z


Fantastic.Z Theatre Company was founded by a few of Seattle’s LGBTQ artists who strived to bring queer arts and artists to the foreground.  They started out ensembly generating one production per year taking source material and focusing it through their queer lens. During the four years of this process their ensemble’s vision grew, leading them away from only generating their own new work and toward producing full seasons focused on both new and under produced works and reaching out to their LGBTQ and theatre community alike.Fantastic.Z Theatre Company continually strives to amuse, amaze, entertain and inspire their community.      
What We Need 

   Theater is Expensive! 
One of our biggest needs are funds for rehearsal/performance space.  If you live in Seattle, you know how much it costs to keep your place.  An average production's rehearsal and performance rental can cost up to three times your monthly rent! Not to mention buying props, costumes, and sets etc.
 Our actors, designers, and crew work hard to bring you the theatrical cocktails you've come to savor and enjoy. Your donation will help us validate their efforts. 
 All funds raised go to Fantastic Z's 2014/2015 season see detailed season info below.
 
  What You Get
We have great perks at varied donation levels that bring you closer to Fantastic.Z Theatre Company and our art.  You also get the joy of supporting the theatre arts and joining the elite group of our contributors!
The Impact Because of you... 
Members of the LGBTQ and Greater Seattle Community alike will learn and grow in a venue of mutual respect and interest.
 We will deliver another year of engaging theater, education, and enrichment focused through our queer lens.
Your generous donation supports the growth of Fantastic Z Theatre Company and queer arts in the city of Seattle.


   Today, theater cannot survive without the reinforcement of its champions - benevolent people like you!  It takes a predetermined enterprise of many individuals to make a season happen.

Every year Fantastic Z develops its resources, this is your opportunity to add to the value of Seattle's Premier LGBTQ Theatre Company.  

  Here is what's in store for our 2nd season!


First Main-Stage Show
In December, we present Reckless by Craig Lucas at The Annex Theater.
Performance dates are Thursday - Saturday December 4th - December 20th 2014.
THE STORY: At home on Christmas Eve, Rachel is informed by her guilty husband that he has hired a hit man to kill her, and she must flee for her life—which she does by scrambling out the kitchen window and into the snowy night. She meets and joins up with Lloyd Bophtelophti, a true ""original"" who has changed his name to avoid alimony payments and who now lives with a paraplegic named Pootie (who also pretends to be deaf in order to get double disability). Rachel then wins $100,000 on a TV game show and begins a series of picaresque escapades involving numerous psychiatrists and, eventually, an ill-fated reunion with her husband. In the end, Rachel becomes a therapist herself, treating her own child (who fails to recognize her) and is led more and more to ponder whether the modern world might not be a vast conspiracy designed to systematically undermine her own increasingly shaky sanity.
3rd Annual New Works Festival
This year's title is Truth & Consequences and will be performed at Rendezvous' JewelBox Theater February 24th - 28th 2015.
THE STORY:  Each year Z reaches out to local, young, up and coming playwrights and curates a show from these submissions that speaks to the overall theme of our season.  This process takes several directors working on a few short pieces pulling from a larger ensemble of actors playing multiple roles to bring these new works to life.  
Second Main-Stage Show
Our spring show in May of 2015 is Sidewinders by Basil Kreimendahl. 
Location:TBD
THE STORY:  The winner of the 2013 Rella Lossy Award for Playwrighting, this quick and witty new work is a transgender western in the style of ""Waiting for Godot"".  Z loves it.  And you will too! 
Sidewinders received its world premiere at The Cutting Ball Theater, Rob Melrose, Artistic Director.
“The world premiere of Sidewinders owes as much to Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot as it does to SF Pride. In this absurdist-Western romp through gender queerness, Dakota and Bailey are new friends who find themselves lost, possibly upside down, on a vast frontier. Their journey to getting right side up provokes questions of sex anatomy, transgenderism, and who we really are from the inside out.”

It was formed in the Spring of 2012 by a group of gay writers with a dream and a flair for comedy.  We couldn't have imagined that only 2 years later we would be nominated for our first TBA Award!  We are a San Francisco-based theater company that focuses on producing queer-themed plays written by local and national playwrights. Each year, we develop two original shows that promote diversity and encourage community involvement.


Our newest show is ""Shock & Awww"", an evening of short comedic plays on love, dating & other hazards. It explores the trials, tribulations and occasional land mines of relationships and dating. This project is so important because it shows the lives of LGBT people in ways that you haven't seen before. 

Without you, we wouldn't be able to get this show on its feet. Without you, we wouldn't be able to start the dialog needed to tackle the issues that gay people are still facing today. Without you, there would be a little less laughter in the world.  
By giving from your heart, you are giving gay artists across the nation a voice.

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""><h3>Project Summary</h3>Body &amp; Soul Dance Theatre is
the longest running modern dance company in Broward County.  We have a history of innovative choreography
and community outreach with emphasis on educating “the community through the
art of theatre and dance”.  Originally a
for-profit entity, Body &amp; Soul went on a brief hiatus and re-emerged as a
non-profit that reaffirmed its commitment to the community.</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>Each season, the company offers
classes in the community, gives pop up performances all over the county and
hires local dancers to participate in our annual production.  The annual production is a collaborative
affair that continually pushes choreographers and dancers to explore different
aspects of dance through storytelling and the use of different genres.</p>
<p>In our production of <i>Dance through the Ages</i>, Body &amp; Soul
will explore the evolution of dance from the birth of ballet in 1489 to what we
imagine dance will look like in the future. 
Along the way, we will use different dance milestones to anchor the
performance in time: the Victorian court dances, the introduction of square
dancing and salsa in the 1700s, the first musicals featuring dance in the late
1800s, and the modern versions of ballet and its offshoots (i.e. modern,
lyrical, contemporary and jazz) as they appeared in the 1900s and the
2000s.  These pieces will be structured
and staged using written accounts of the styles from archives as well as
featuring original choreography.  The
music will be researched to depict the era that is being featured.  The intent is to take audience members on a
journey through time that sparks an awareness of dance and its evolution as a
reflection of the cultures and history that developed it.</p>
<p>Since this production covers the
better part of a millennium’s worth of dance, the only way to accomplish that
feat with the appropriate level of consideration and finesse is to enlist
help.  Our help comes in the form of a
number of partnerships with some dynamic visual artists: Nicole Kent of Nicole
Kent, Inc (photography/videography), Donna Haynes (original costume design), Beth
K Amato (digital animation) and Renan Machado (graphic design).  With their assistance, we will span decades
and at times, centuries, through the use of photography, animation and
film.  Dancers will jump off the screen,
transported from one time period to another as the world is torn apart and
reassembled with words, sounds, gestures and interactions shared between
dancers, audience members and visual artists.</p>
<p>The visual art component is a vital
part of this experience.  They will bring
the palatial majesty of the Victorian court and the steamy intimacy of a Latin
nightclub, the lights and sounds of Broadway and the raw silence of a black box
theater during performance art.  Body and
Soul will provide dancers with the appropriate background and training to
people the worlds created by these artists. 
</p>
<p>It is not simply the removal of the
boundaries often erected between visual and performance art that we seek to
explore, but also the idea that in looking at the history of dance, we are
looking at the history of self-expression. Victorian court dances established a
common ground where courtiers of both sexes could show off their skill in a
time where men and women were chaperoned and kept apart, less their carnal desires
overcome them.  Burlesque was a
provocative attempt to re-establish a sense of self and the joys of carnal
knowledge to a society awakening from a decade of censorship and social
standards that restricted self-expression. 
Modern dance grew directly out of a need to break with the rigidity of
balletic technique.  Jazz expressed the
pain and excitement of a people finding their voice.  </p>
<p><i>Dance
through the Ages</i> will give a variety of genres a historical context.  This context will be created by using
movement that is true to the time period being depicted since the movement and
style of a technique are a direct reflection of the contexts that created
them.  The authenticity of the dance will
be further enhanced by original costume designs.  Animation, film and photography will also be
used to create a clear sense of place and time for each piece.</p>

</div></div>","Project SummaryBody & Soul Dance Theatre is
the longest running modern dance company in Broward County.  We have a history of innovative choreography
and community outreach with emphasis on educating “the community through the
art of theatre and dance”.  Originally a
for-profit entity, Body & Soul went on a brief hiatus and re-emerged as a
non-profit that reaffirmed its commitment to the community.

Each season, the company offers
classes in the community, gives pop up performances all over the county and
hires local dancers to participate in our annual production.  The annual production is a collaborative
affair that continually pushes choreographers and dancers to explore different
aspects of dance through storytelling and the use of different genres.
In our production of Dance through the Ages, Body & Soul
will explore the evolution of dance from the birth of ballet in 1489 to what we
imagine dance will look like in the future. 
Along the way, we will use different dance milestones to anchor the
performance in time: the Victorian court dances, the introduction of square
dancing and salsa in the 1700s, the first musicals featuring dance in the late
1800s, and the modern versions of ballet and its offshoots (i.e. modern,
lyrical, contemporary and jazz) as they appeared in the 1900s and the
2000s.  These pieces will be structured
and staged using written accounts of the styles from archives as well as
featuring original choreography.  The
music will be researched to depict the era that is being featured.  The intent is to take audience members on a
journey through time that sparks an awareness of dance and its evolution as a
reflection of the cultures and history that developed it.
Since this production covers the
better part of a millennium’s worth of dance, the only way to accomplish that
feat with the appropriate level of consideration and finesse is to enlist
help.  Our help comes in the form of a
number of partnerships with some dynamic visual artists: Nicole Kent of Nicole
Kent, Inc (photography/videography), Donna Haynes (original costume design), Beth
K Amato (digital animation) and Renan Machado (graphic design).  With their assistance, we will span decades
and at times, centuries, through the use of photography, animation and
film.  Dancers will jump off the screen,
transported from one time period to another as the world is torn apart and
reassembled with words, sounds, gestures and interactions shared between
dancers, audience members and visual artists.
The visual art component is a vital
part of this experience.  They will bring
the palatial majesty of the Victorian court and the steamy intimacy of a Latin
nightclub, the lights and sounds of Broadway and the raw silence of a black box
theater during performance art.  Body and
Soul will provide dancers with the appropriate background and training to
people the worlds created by these artists. 

It is not simply the removal of the
boundaries often erected between visual and performance art that we seek to
explore, but also the idea that in looking at the history of dance, we are
looking at the history of self-expression. Victorian court dances established a
common ground where courtiers of both sexes could show off their skill in a
time where men and women were chaperoned and kept apart, less their carnal desires
overcome them.  Burlesque was a
provocative attempt to re-establish a sense of self and the joys of carnal
knowledge to a society awakening from a decade of censorship and social
standards that restricted self-expression. 
Modern dance grew directly out of a need to break with the rigidity of
balletic technique.  Jazz expressed the
pain and excitement of a people finding their voice.  
Dance
through the Ages will give a variety of genres a historical context.  This context will be created by using
movement that is true to the time period being depicted since the movement and
style of a technique are a direct reflection of the contexts that created
them.  The authenticity of the dance will
be further enhanced by original costume designs.  Animation, film and photography will also be
used to create a clear sense of place and time for each piece.

With the soul-wrenching assistance of the Violent Femmes, Frank Sinatra, and Bonnie Tyler, among others, they explode the sibling-like entanglements of Miss Conni’s ensemble.
This new show was originally developed in five days at North American Cultural Laboratory’s retreat space in Highland Lake, NY.  It is currently undergoing a second phase of development as part of the Motherlodge festival in Louisville, KY.  With your support, we can bring the final production back to New York.
 
What will my donation support?
Artists fees
Food costs
Rehearsal & performance space
Design materials & transport
 
Why are you raising this much right now? 
We need to put down a deposit on the space in April, and our indiegogo goal will ensure we can book it!  The costs of developing the production are five times this goal and are not covered by ticket sales.  Our hope is exceed!

<h3>Summary &amp; History of the Show</h3>
<p><em>Mahmoud</em> is an irreverent &amp; hilarious one-woman show about an aging Iranian engineer-cum-taxi driver, a fabulously gay Spaniard, and a young Iranian-Canadian girl, all trying to get by the day-to-day grind in the city they call home: Toronto.</p>
<p>Their stories come together over the course of an hour, and through their connections with the audience, themselves and each other, they explore the themes of displacement, immigration, home, and culture.</p>
<p>Performed by Tara Grammy, <em>Mahmoud</em> is co-written by Grammy and director Tom Arthur Davis, who have been developing the project since 2009. It has seen developmental help from Chalmers Winner Leah Cherniak and Dora Winner Soheil Parsa, who acted as the consulting director for the March 2011 production.</p>

<h3>The Impact of <em>Mahmoud</em>
</h3>
<p>This show comes at a very turbulent time in Iranian politics. We began <em>Mahmoud</em>, three years ago during the calm before the storm that turned out to be the 2009 presidential elections in Tara's home country of Iran. A lot has happened since then, and we all live under the shadow of a possible war. How Iranians are seen on a global scale is important at this time. Iranians worldwide have made a voice for themselves, particularly in the art world, and we hope to join them with this show. </p>
<p>This show helps give a voice to highly educated immigrants (like Mahmoud) who find themselves at a disadvantage because of a flawed system. It addresses the oppression of the Iranian homosexual community, and the hardships of growing up as a first generation immigrant. We hope with this show, we can help break some of the stigmas floating around about Iranians and share with you a part of Iranian culture inside and outside of Iran. In the media, the only things people hear about Iranians have to do with either Ahmadinejad or the recent reality TV show, Shahs of Sunset. Fanatical Islam or Insane Materialism. There is far more to us than that. By helping <em>Mahmoud</em> make its international debut, you are helping us to show people some of our rich culture and history. You are showing them that there is more to our culture than Islam, that we do not all drive BMWs, and that although we are proud of our culture and history, we recognise our flaws, and our huge generation of young people aim to fix them. </p>
<p>This show is not just for Iranians. It is for everyone who has ever faced racism and oppression, all immigrants and those who live alongside them. </p>

<h2><span><strong>Summary</strong></span></h2>
<p><span><strong>A bit about me and how my project came into fruition:</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>My name is G.J. Dowding and I am a writer, director, and performer living in Brooklyn, New York. I have attended both Wagner College and New York University where I studied everything from vocal performance, music theory, acting, journalism, and fiction/poetry writing. Most of my training has been rooted in acting and I think of it as the foundation and skeleton for my new artistic directions. I am currently exploring what physical theater can do and how I can express my own experiences andartistic point of view through the medium of performance art. I am interested in traversing through the many vignettes of art; being open minded and encompassing an amalgam of themes by infusing different art forms. Collaboration is important to me. By collaborating we are able to expand in new directions through the format of an artistic conversation. Collaboration creates the platform to learn from someone else and in exchange gift them with the exposure and knowledge of your own artistic medium.</span></p>
<p><span>My project, <em>Quizically Quimsical: An Exploration of Exploitation,</em> is an original multi-media performance piece based on my poetry and prose that I am directing and self producing. The campaign is a very intimate and personal labor of love. I have always loved the idea of being an actor; a vessel that portrays a form of art. In my exploration of this I have discovered a passion for creating my own art.Throughout my life I have always enjoyed writing and kept it as a pastime for many years. But over the past two years I have become more serious about writing and I have developed clearer opinions on my perspective and interpretation of art.</span></p>
<p><span>I feel as though fate has brought me to this project. As a gay male, I have been exploring queer identity, persona, and art over the past year. In conjunction with that, I have been writing a lot on queer theory and my personal upbringing in a queer lifestyle. My performance piece is essentially a queer solo performance piece with a supporting ensemble. It is autobiographical, filled in with splendid fiction of course :) As I said before, I love bringing various art forms together within one context, so I decided to present my writing in collaboration with music and movement. This is where the ensemble comes in; to aid in the telling of a personal queer story, to bring the psyche and subconscious to life. This project is not only based on my career goals as an artist but is also meant to serve as a therapeutic conversation with people. I want to hear as many people’s stories in the world as possible in my lifetime and this is my contribution to the conversation.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>We need a total of <strong>$7,500</strong> to make this thing happen by September 2012. Our biggest expense is performance space. We want to make the many months of hard work in rehearsals pay off for all of our beautiful actors by performing the piece at least five times. There are of course many other expenses that come into play, no pun intended, as well. Here's a break down of all the things we (broke students and recent college grads) need your help with:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Rehearsal space - BAX (Brooklyn Arts Exchange)</span></li>
<li><span>Performance space - Gene Frankel Theatre and House of Yes</span></li>
<li><span>Concessions</span></li>
<li><span>Costume designer and constume material </span></li>
<li><span>Set designer and set material</span></li>
<li><span>Artist compensation</span></li>
<li><span>AV technition(s) (lights and sound)</span></li>
<li><span>Advertising/promotional material </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>In return for your most generous contribution we will repay you with a variety of unique perks!</strong> These include tickets to the show, Q&amp;As with the cast, dance lessons, personalized poetry by G.J. and song recordings by Hillary... and much more! You can check out the full list of rewards on the righthand side of the page.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>If for some reason we do not reach our entire goal</strong>, all of the funds will still be used towards the performance piece. This would mean only perfoming the work once or twice, and downsizing on cosume/set design and promotional material.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span><strong>The Impact</strong></span></h2>
<p><span><strong>By donating to this project, you are not only helping me begin what I hope to be my work for the rest of my life, but you will also give exposure to some deeply talented fellow artists as well.</strong> I am working with a blossoming singer/songwriter, <a href=""http://www.hillarycapps.com/hc/Home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hillary Capps</a>, an extremely talented and smart choreographer, <a href=""http://jillenejohnsonjj.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jillene Johnson</a>, a visionary costume and set designer, Diego Montoya, and eight incredibly eager, enthusiastic, unique, and talented actors: Aidan Davis, Jamarr John Johnson, Elisa Marti, Alesandra Nahodil, Shlomit Oren, Laura Riveros, Yael Shavitt and J.R. Yussuf. These artists all have their own individual messages they want to spread out to the New York City art scene and the world. Their voices are so beautiful and deserved to be heard.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Campaigns such as this one have the potential to be extremely successful and important.</strong> A few months ago Hillary Capps did a campaign to fund her first EP of original music on a similar website, Kickstarter, and received overwhelming support, making her goal of $3,500 with ten days to spare.

<div>Dead Unicorn Ink, is an Ottawa based theatre company that specializes in bringing design and concepts usually reserved for film to the stage. Founded in 2011 by Patrice Forbes, Sylvie Recoskie and Mike Doiron, DUi premiered Playing Dead, a zombie puppet show. Playing Dead went on to win the 2011 Outstanding Design Award from the Ottawa Fringe Festival for it's creative use of slayable puppets. In 2012 DUi traveled to outer space with the Fan Favourite Award winner Space Mystery From Outer Space. In this adventure we brought giant tentacles, a lizard monster big enough to eat whole actors, and the front end of a Camaro with working headlights to the stage. Since then we have used our shows to push the boundaries of technical aspects of stage (a three-seat couch puppet in Chesterfield, a beating heart in Scars and tentacle hands in Mermaids). </div>
<div>We employ local artists of all sorts and each show features new casts. From mechanics in far off Smiths Falls to Ottawa central graphic designers we work with a large variety of technical talents. We strive to support new and young artists and continue to recommend them to other Ottawa companies after our time with them. And we pay! We always provide a set rate for artists, and then a profit share on top to ensure that everyone is appreciated. </div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our most recent show, Kavalier's Kuriosities, is our first step into the darker side of theatre. A mixture of side-show curiosity and dramatic family crisis, Kavalier's shows us the world from the perspective of the outcast of society. </span>
</div>

<div>""The shadow puppets themselves are absolutely beautiful in design... The shocking events at the plays end will give you something to talk about,"" -Brianna McFarlane                                                                                                                       New Ottawa Critics</div> <p>""The performance itself and acting displayed were outstanding,"" -Jean McLernon                                                                                                                               Apt 613</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why Are We Asking For Your Money?</h3>
<div>Like most young theatre companies we believed in the concept of letting our work support itself. Again, like most companies, we began to realize the importance of grants, government support and blessed donors such as yourselves. We strive to ensure that each of our artists are compensated for their work and receive the opportunity to present their hard efforts to audiences.</div>
<div>We are looking for your support to send our company to the Atlantic Fringe Festival. The money we raise will go entirely to the tour and its costs:</div>
<div>- $580 Entrance fee to the Atlantic Fringe Festival. A total of eight shows at the Bus Stop Theatre</div>
<div>- $600 in travel costs (gas, expensive, expensive gas)</div>
<div>- $320 Accommodations, with a cast and crew of eight, touring seemed impossible. However we've been able to beg and borrow sleeping spaces and narrowed down our cost to a fraction of what it could have been.</div>
<div>- $250 Rehearsal rental! We should probably practice the show.</div>
<div>- $250 Prop, set and costume costs. Mainly blood, the high cost of fake blood, also cleaning said blood out of the costumes and repeat.</div>
<div><b>What if we raise money and make money off the show?</b></div>
<div>- Then we pay our artists. We have a full team including a sound designer, set/prop/light designer, actors, puppeteers, make-up designer, writers and producers that often make less then their work deserves. </div>
<div>- As well any money the company makes is used to develop new works and future projects.</div>
<div><b>What if we don't make enough money?</b></div>
<div>- As often has to happen the producers will absorb the costs of the show and cuts will have to be made.</div>
<div>- No costumes for the next show! This could be good, could be bad. Want to chance it, or donate and ensure a fully clothed cast?</div>
<div>- Sock puppets for remaining shows, made from the sad holey socks of desperate actors. You can smell the sweat for Sally Sock Head and see the taught, tired toes of Tony Two Heels.</div>
<div>- Our next show will consist fully of actors sitting on chairs (naked?) staring at the audience and crying. Artistic choice or desperation? We'll let the critics decide.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Future!</h3> <p>By helping us now, not only are you helping DUi expand and take it's work to new places and audiences but your also ensuring the future of the company to continue to expand their technical skills and experiment with new forms of puppetry.</p>
<p>Most notable is our next show, Under Derek's Bed. A show produced during the TACTICS series at Ottawa Arts Court April 2014, UDB will feature mask, puppets and fantasy styled stage design. Written by Sylvie Recoskie and directed by Martin Glassford, UDB will be a return to the DUi style of B movies brought to stage. Love the Dark Crystal, Labyrinth or Neverending Story? Under Derek's Bed holds all the same whimsy with a fraction of the production budget!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>We are a troupe of young professional theatre artists, so we understand being broke. Can't contribute today? Show your support by sharing this campaign! Pass it along to friends or family who you think might be interested in supporting the arts. Have a rich, seclusive Uncle, with hobbies that include re-animating corpses, wandering parapets of an ancient castle or training small mammals to do his bidding? I'm sure he'd love to hear about us!</div> <p><br/></p>

The shocking events at the plays end will give you something to talk about,"" -Brianna McFarlane                                                                                                                       New Ottawa Critics ""The performance itself and acting displayed were outstanding,"" -Jean McLernon                                                                                                                               Apt 613
   Why Are We Asking For Your Money?
Like most young theatre companies we believed in the concept of letting our work support itself. Again, like most companies, we began to realize the importance of grants, government support and blessed donors such as yourselves. We strive to ensure that each of our artists are compensated for their work and receive the opportunity to present their hard efforts to audiences.
We are looking for your support to send our company to the Atlantic Fringe Festival. The money we raise will go entirely to the tour and its costs:
- $580 Entrance fee to the Atlantic Fringe Festival. A total of eight shows at the Bus Stop Theatre
- $600 in travel costs (gas, expensive, expensive gas)
- $320 Accommodations, with a cast and crew of eight, touring seemed impossible. However we've been able to beg and borrow sleeping spaces and narrowed down our cost to a fraction of what it could have been.
- $250 Rehearsal rental! We should probably practice the show.
- $250 Prop, set and costume costs. Mainly blood, the high cost of fake blood, also cleaning said blood out of the costumes and repeat.
What if we raise money and make money off the show?
- Then we pay our artists. We have a full team including a sound designer, set/prop/light designer, actors, puppeteers, make-up designer, writers and producers that often make less then their work deserves. 
- As well any money the company makes is used to develop new works and future projects.
What if we don't make enough money?
- As often has to happen the producers will absorb the costs of the show and cuts will have to be made.
- No costumes for the next show! This could be good, could be bad. Want to chance it, or donate and ensure a fully clothed cast?
- Sock puppets for remaining shows, made from the sad holey socks of desperate actors. You can smell the sweat for Sally Sock Head and see the taught, tired toes of Tony Two Heels.
- Our next show will consist fully of actors sitting on chairs (naked?) staring at the audience and crying. Artistic choice or desperation? We'll let the critics decide.

  The Future! By helping us now, not only are you helping DUi expand and take it's work to new places and audiences but your also ensuring the future of the company to continue to expand their technical skills and experiment with new forms of puppetry.
Most notable is our next show, Under Derek's Bed. A show produced during the TACTICS series at Ottawa Arts Court April 2014, UDB will feature mask, puppets and fantasy styled stage design. Written by Sylvie Recoskie and directed by Martin Glassford, UDB will be a return to the DUi style of B movies brought to stage. Love the Dark Crystal, Labyrinth or Neverending Story? Under Derek's Bed holds all the same whimsy with a fraction of the production budget!

<h3>Soul Conductor Plot Description  <br/>
</h3>Maude is the lone employee in the Afterlife. Her 
routine of tending to The Ghosts and watching souls dissipate is 
disrupted when a suspicious spirit named Woman appears in Maude’s 
office. After Woman doesn’t disappear like the other ghosts, Maude 
discovers that Woman is still living, and has come to the Afterlife to 
retrieve her late husband. As Woman’s prolonged presence in the 
afterlife threatens to rupture the fabric of reality, Maude has to 
confront Woman and the rebelling Ghosts in order to save all planes of 
existence from destruction. Soul Conductor is an ectoplasmic romp about 
what happens when the things we're haunted by get out of hand.<br/><br/><h3>Cast <br/>

routine of tending to The Ghosts and watching souls dissipate is 
disrupted when a suspicious spirit named Woman appears in Maude’s 
office. After Woman doesn’t disappear like the other ghosts, Maude 
discovers that Woman is still living, and has come to the Afterlife to 
retrieve her late husband. As Woman’s prolonged presence in the 
afterlife threatens to rupture the fabric of reality, Maude has to 
confront Woman and the rebelling Ghosts in order to save all planes of 
existence from destruction. Soul Conductor is an ectoplasmic romp about 
what happens when the things we're haunted by get out of hand.Cast

The Impact
By supporting Soul Conductor you are encouraging the creativity of today's youth and helping young artists to have a voice in the world. This new work has been created completely by students but needs your help to realize its full potential. 

Every year Vertigo, a northwestern theatre board, showcases many new voices through their commitment to student written work. 

These types of projects have gone onto be showcased at theatres in Chicago and New York 

We want Soul Conductor to make a difference, to portray a new world, and give the audience a new perspective.


WE NEED YOU!
Any little contribution will help. This production will not be possible without you. Thank you so much!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is a Tetralogy?   </h3>
<p>   A  Tetralogy  is a body of work/art composed of four pieces or elements (such as the four operas which make up Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen).  Our use of the term is with reference to the tetralogies of ancient Greece, where each chosen playwright at the festival of Dionysus presented three tragedies followed by a satyr play, all shown in one sitting.</p>
<p>    The Ccollanan Pachacamac Tetralogy is composed of three tragedies:  Ccollanan Pachacamac, Ricuy Auccacunac, &amp; Yahuarniy , with the satyr play Hichascancuta. Each is a truly silent film with no dialogue where all elements of the musical and visual creation have been subjected to the surrealist principles of automatism and objective chance.</p>
<p>    We have been given special permission by the Warner Grand Theatre and the city of Los Angeles to have a one night only production of all four films of the Ccollanan Pachacamac Tetralogy complete with a three dimensional musical and theatrical component.  This screening and theatre presentation will take place on Wednesday May 29 2013 at the Warner Grand Theatre in San Pedro and will end with the world premiere of Hichascancuta.</p>
<p>     </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>$1800 ---  our  fundraising goal?!</h3>
<p>      The LA Opera has an annual budget of $60 million. Yuyanapaq has, well, less than that.  Much less.</p>
<p>      In an effort, though, to offer a presentation on that same level (albeit in a different realm of artistic language), Yuyanapaq hopes to raise $1800 to cover partial production costs (set design, costumes, stage lighting) as well as theatre rental and technical costs. Any funds raised over this amount will go towards the remaining costs of the production. </p>
<p>      Yuyanapaq wishes to thank all those who donate, whether $9 or $584,  for helping to stage this unique multimedia event.  As bonuses for those who donate, Yuyanapaq is pressing a limited edition run of 13 copies of the satyr play Hichascancuta on gold dvd; this will be the ONLY pressing of this fourth and final film.  In addition, Yuyanapaq is offering four unique and one of a kind artpieces that were used in the filming of the tetralogy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Yuyanapaq????</h3>
<p>     The word  ""yuyanapaq""  comes from the Quechua language of ancient Peru and means  ""to remember"".</p>
<p>      The titles of each film in the Ccollanan Pachacamac tetralogy come from the last sentence spoken by the Inca Tupac Amaru before he was beheaded in 1572.  This tetralogy references not only the ancient american symbology and knowledge of plants and celestial bodies, but the functioning of thought itself as ""pure psychic automatism"" amidst the world of dreams and the subconscious.</p>
<p>      Musically, Yuyanapaq is composed of Chaupituta (on drums/percussion/mallets), Hurinpacha (on bowed guitar, bass, concertina), and Yuyanapaq (on keyboards/samples/theremin), along with guest performers.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Warner Grand Theatre</h3>
<p>      Yuyanapaq wishes to thank Lee Sweet of the Warner Grand Theatre for the opportunity to perform in this historic venue.  The Warner Brothers  (of Warner Bros. films fame) had three ""cinema palaces"" constructed in the early 1930s --  one in beverly hills, one in huntington park, and one in san pedro.  The Warner Grand Theatre in San Pedro is the only one of the three still standing in her original glory, and is one of the only LA area theatres with a true orchestra pit.</p>
<p>       Please join Yuyanapaq for this ONE NIGHT ONLY screening and multimedia production, which will occur one hundred years exactly, (to the night) of the premiere of Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps (in Paris on may 29 1913).  </p>

<p>           On November 28th, 2013 Intertwined will be staged at Centrepointe Theatre.  In Intertwined, we invite you on a journey through the human condition. We offer a glimpse into personal moments of time, moving snapshots of life. View intimate moments of laughter, humour, the outrageous, the inquisitive, the grieving and the longing. Eavesdrop on conversations behind closed doors. Open your mind and your heart to the possibilities of what we can be and where we are headed. As we track our own journeys, we will inevitably be tangled within the journeys of others. We are connected. We are Intertwined.</p>
<p>          Promoting and growing a professional dance industry in Ottawa is a goal we all want to see succeed. The arts needs its audience. And the audience needs its artists. Your donation not only helps support arts in our community, but it pays a dancer's salary. It buys rehearsal space and costumes, and theatre rentals and promotional material and the millions of other details that go into creating a show. It's allowing someone to earn their living and create something unique. By donating, you become a part of that creation. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $7000.00. This money will help pay for the theatre rental, costumes, promotional materials and most importantly-DANCER SALARIES. This last point is important. Dancers and artists deserve to make their living. We are trying to create a self-sustaining professional industry and allow dancers to be compensated in the way that they deserve. These artists work harder than anyone, long physical hours in the studio to bring something beautiful and moving to the stage. </p>

Hope for a larger professional dance industry in our Nation's Capital. Hope for bringing about a change in how we view the payment of dancers. It's opportunity. Opportunity for growth and new enterprise. Let's all get involved and bring it to life. </p>

</p><p><b>Dear Cabrillo College Dance Supporters,</b></p><b>
</b><p><b>I am reaching out to you because I believe you care about
dance at Cabrillo College.</b> We are currently rehearsing for the Spring Dance
Concert. We had 67 students audition to dance in the show last week. It was an
amazing feeling to have so much creative energy on the Crocker Theater stage.</p>
<p><b>Next month we are taking nine Cabrillo dancers to the
American College Dance Festival (ACDF), which is being held this year at
Arizona State University in Tempe. </b>ACDF is the nation’s premiere college dance
event. It’s a place where students come together to exchange ideas, see
performances, and take classes. The faculty who teach come from all over the
Western Region – so this is an ideal opportunity for our students to see what is
going on in dance on a national level, and to consider what four year

<p></p></div>","Dear Cabrillo College Dance Supporters,
I am reaching out to you because I believe you care about
dance at Cabrillo College. We are currently rehearsing for the Spring Dance
Concert. We had 67 students audition to dance in the show last week. It was an
amazing feeling to have so much creative energy on the Crocker Theater stage.
Next month we are taking nine Cabrillo dancers to the
American College Dance Festival (ACDF), which is being held this year at
Arizona State University in Tempe. ACDF is the nation’s premiere college dance
event. It’s a place where students come together to exchange ideas, see
performances, and take classes. The faculty who teach come from all over the
Western Region – so this is an ideal opportunity for our students to see what is
going on in dance on a national level, and to consider what four year
university program to transfer to.  
The location of the ACDF Western Region Conference changes
from year to year. The last time I took dancers it was held in Modesto, so we
drove and that kept the expenses down. This year we have the additional cost of
flying to Tempe for the four days of the conference. The price of the nine plane
tickets is $2,799. The students have already paid for their registration ($120),
and the Cabrillo Student Senate has given us $2000 towards hotel costs and
small portion of the travel. 
As you know, many of our students are working their way
through school, and don’t have a lot of extra money. All nine of them have
committed to paying the remaining expenses, but we know that for some of them
this a bit of a stretch. That’s why we need your help.
Our goal is to raise a minimum of $2000 in the next two weeks to cover
the majority of the remaining travel costs. The Cabrillo dancers who are going
to the American College Dance Festival this year are:
Alyssa KrauterDaniella Nasello

Tamara Nelson
Alyssa Jenkins
Julia Daniel
Charley Fierro
Jessica Laufer
Megan Fultz
Chelsea ZamoraI will be going with them as their faculty representative,
but all of the proceeds from this campaign will go to the students’ expenses. This is a ""fixed funding"" campaign which means if we don't reach our goal we don't receive any of the funds. If we raise more than $2000, additional contributions will go to covering dancers' meals and local transportation.I hope you are as excited about this opportunity for our
students as I am. These young dancers continue to inspire me and I believe that
they deserve the best educational opportunities we can provide them with.

<p>This summer, Midsommer Flight will present <em>Ro</em><em>meo and Juliet</em> at two Chicago Park District locations in July and August.  We are thrilled and excited to present this Shakespeare in the park experience for FREE to our audiences - but that means we need your help to make it happen.</p>
<p>This is the second production for Midsommer Flight, after <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> last summer.  Last year, we reached an audience of close to 300 people over four performances at one park.  This year, we are doubling our performances, with eight shows over four weekends at two parks.  It was thrilling last summer to reach out into the neighborhood and see the kids who hang out at the park get excited about Shakespeare. We can't wait to do it again this summer!</p>
<p>When the show ended last summer, we were surprised and delighted to be honored with a resolution from the Chicago City Council, co-signed by Mayer Rahm Emanuel and City Clerk Susana Mendoza, which stated, <strong>""<em><span style=""color: #000000;"">Be it resolved, That we, the Mayor and the members of the Chicago City Council, assembled this twelfth day of September, 2012, do hereby honor the Midsommer Flight theater troupe on their dedication to bringing the arts to underserved communities."" </span></em></strong></p>
<p>We are so excited to get out in the parks and do it again this year.  And we need your help to do it!  Please consider donating the cost of an average theatre ticket (anywhere from $50 to $20) to help us reach our $1,500 goal.</p>
<p>The play is directed by Midsommer Flight founder and Producing Artistic Director, Beth Wolf.

<h3>The Show:</h3>
<p><strong>WUNDERWORLD</strong> tells the story of an 80 year-old Alice going back down the rabbit hole for one last adventure. Much has changed since her first visit, including the cast of colorful characters that populate what is now known as Wunderworld. How will time and age affect Alice and her friends? Is the Rabbit still late? Is the Hatter still mad? Will Alice find her way back to the retirement villa or lose her head in the process? Find out in this musical stage production created and performed by the Thrillride Mechanics: the Bay Area's hyper-comical theater of human animation!</p>
<p><strong><em>THIS JUST IN:</em></strong> <strong>WUNDERWORLD</strong> is returning to San Francisco in a big way! Join us July 13-August 11 at the Creativity Theater, the beautiful new theater at the Children's Creativity Museum in Yerba Buena Gardens! Audiences of all ages have already fallen in love with elderly Alice and this innovative retelling of Lewis Carroll's classic tale. Now the show is bigger, bolder, and better than ever! There's much more in store for <strong>WUNDERWORLD</strong> and we need your help!</p>
<p>By donating to our IndieGoGo campaign you become an integral part of bringing <strong>WUNDERWORLD</strong> to its new home at the Creativity Theater.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Verismo Opera Theater, a professional opera company based in Chicagoland’s Oak Park, Illinois, is preparing a production of Verdi’s masterpiece “La Traviata” staged in 1915 Oak Park. The sets, costumes and atmospheric elements will all reflect the signature style of world-renowned architect and Oak Park native <strong>Frank Lloyd Wright</strong>.<br/><br/> The Verismo Opera Theater team has recruited the assistance of Frank Lloyd Wright scholar and image collector Tom Heinz who will assist in creating unique projections featuring his one-of-a-kind collection of more than 35,000 Frank Lloyd Wright images to create the Wright-inspired set using homes in Oak Park. Mr. Heinz will also prepare a free pre-concert lecture on the work of Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>
<p><strong>Verismo Opera Theater needs your support.  A donation of any amount is a reason to sing!  But if you can afford to help us with props ($150) or to hire a professional costume designer ($200)</strong>, we can achieve our mission of supplying low-budget/high-value classical lively arts to an opera-loving community stretched for disposable income.  Some folks dream of having season tickets to the Lyric or Met.  We can give them a night at the opera without the prohibitive cost.  <strong>You can help.</strong></p>
<p>The mission of the Verismo Opera Club is to engage our audiences by producing relevant, truthful, and emotionally direct performances. We strive to share with our colleagues and patrons the moment of recreation by focusing on the essence of the opera – the music and the humanity within the composer’s score. “Verismo” not only applies to a genre of opera, but rather a philosophy of connecting with our public the eternal truths inherent in everyday life. An opera is merely a collection of the most pivotal moments in life written for each character. The journeys that these characters take us on should resonate with us all as we go through our day-to-day existence. We strive to share on the stage what we experience in our own lives – love, loss, joy, hope. We recognize that by ourselves, the music is lifeless. Therefore we need to share with our audiences in order to create art. </p>

The mission of the Verismo Opera Club is to engage our audiences by producing relevant, truthful, and emotionally direct performances. We strive to share with our colleagues and patrons the moment of recreation by focusing on the essence of the opera – the music and the humanity within the composer’s score. “Verismo” not only applies to a genre of opera, but rather a philosophy of connecting with our public the eternal truths inherent in everyday life. An opera is merely a collection of the most pivotal moments in life written for each character. The journeys that these characters take us on should resonate with us all as we go through our day-to-day existence. We strive to share on the stage what we experience in our own lives – love, loss, joy, hope. We recognize that by ourselves, the music is lifeless. Therefore we need to share with our audiences in order to create art.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Dear Diary, Bye. is a play based on Ellie Brown's 4th grade diary from 1984. It features school yard scrapping, a boy crazy tale, family troubles and sweet misunderstandings of adult concepts. It's a comedic and family friendly piece. Did I mention that the diary is being read by a MAN? Yes, it's true. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Ellie Brown is a visual artist and an educator. This piece came about when Ellie's father was visiting and he was reading the diary aloud. After a fit of laughing so hard she was crying, it became clear to Ellie that this needed to be staged. <br/>
</li>
<li>The piece premiered at the SoLow festival in 2013, read by Harry Watermeier and directed by Seth Reichgott. After the test run, it became even more clear that the piece needed to exist on a stage. Thank you Harry!<br/>
</li>
<li>Self-producing a creative project is almost impossible in this fiscal climate. I want the finest quality production I can offer, which means having to pay people! Yes, artists do get paid for their work, so please help pay our dear actor (Arlen Hancock) so he can stay in Philadelphia and work on this play. Please help pay the wonderful director, Seth Reichgott, for his amazing talents as a director. Please help pay Plays and Players theater which is an amazing 100 year old theater that we all adore. There are also tech people, a stage manager, sets, marketing, etc. etc. You love the arts and the arts love you!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Who wouldn't want to hear the inner musings of a boy crazy nine-year old girl, read by a man?<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>As stated above, the money raised will go straight to paying the actor, crew, theater and marketing expenses for the play. The $7000 requested will JUST cover the costs to self-produce this play. <br/>
</li>
<li>As a donor, you become part of the Diary as a friend, a confidant, a crush, a love, etc. Come see the play for free, get your name in the program, have me send you a page of the diary to admire on your walls, have a PRIVATE reading for you and your friends.....Cool, right?<br/>
</li>
<li>All funds raised will go to the project, whether the goal is met or not. Frankly, any remaining funds will go on my credit card and that is no way to produce theater. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will allow Dear Diary, Bye. to be staged and keep Ellie Brown out of major debt. Most importantly it shows that you support independent theater/art and believe that actors and creative workers should be paid for their time and effort.<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>As a sponsor, you are telling the world that creative work is important and that the voice of a new female playwright needs to be heard.<br/>
</li>
<li>In my life as a fine art photographer, I ran a successful crowd-source campaign to fund a segment of the BAG project. <a href=""http://elliebrown.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://elliebrown.com/home.html</a><br/>
</li>
<li>This piece is about as grassroots as you can get. State and national funding mostly is given to established theater companies, which makes it difficult for an individual producing a play to find financial support. Your support shows that you believe in independent art and theater!<br/>

<h2><em><strong>“There wasn’t a cough or creak in the house...”</strong></em></h2>
<p>A few months ago, Pook's Hill director Ken Schatz began working with a group of professional actors on a rarely-performed one-act play. The casting was just right, and as they began to explore the piece, amazing things started to happen. The characters roared to life in a manner that shook a room of seasoned theatre professionals. The small midtown studio where they had met became a cotton plantation, heavy with menace. Actors exploring new roles transformed into living, breathing, human beings at the end of their ropes, striving for happiness in the confines of the American South. Then came a stunning, goose-bump image at the very end – for a magic moment, everybody held their breath...</p>
<p>The actors relaxed, shook out their arms and legs a bit, and grinned at each other through teary eyes. They knew that this was more than just studio work. They had just been socked in  the gut by one of the greatest, fiercest dramatists in the history of the English language, Tennessee Williams.</p>
<p>Now, Pook's Hill is bringing that extraodinary work to audiences in <em>Something Wild...</em>, three one-act plays by Tennessee Williams.</p>
<p>We hope you'll help us meet our budget. Good theatre costs money, especially here in New York City. With your help, we can bring these rarely seen plays and the unusually daring work of these actors to you.</p>
<h3>Pook's Hill</h3>
<p>Artistic Director Ken Schatz has had a dedicated and enthusiastic following by New York actors for over 18 years. He is also a prominent figure in the national folk music community, performing and leading singing groups in New York and across the country. Pook's Hill is a new company of theatre artists and musicians led by Ken, producing classic plays and developing innovative performance works from history, literature, and folklore.</p>
<p>Something Wild... is the inaugural production of Pook's Hill. Help us explode into the New York theatre community with this amazing piece of work!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>None of the actors or production staff are getting a salary for this show. They're here because they're passionate about the project. But even with that generosity, our expenses are a burden. You can help us to pay for</p>

<li>Insurance (gotta have it!)</li>
<li>A ton of other expenses that keep the wheels turning toward opening night!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3><em>""Something disturbing something irregular, something brave and honest…”</em></h3>
<p>In his 1948 essay for <em>The New York Star</em> titled <em>Something Wild…,</em> Williams wrote that a performance of a play should “deliver a punch to the solar plexus,” in a kind of “benevolent anarchy.”  He remembered with great admiration a low-budget company of actors who delivered an evening of theater after which “nobody left without a disturbing kink in their nerves or guts.” </p>
<p>That's the kind of work your contribution makes possible. In the hypercompetive world of entertainment, the thoughtful and the expressive tends to be pushed aside to make room for the flashy and the alluring.  This is your chance to help foster the elements of theater that connect us all in a deep and important way.</p>

<li>Think of the people in your world that are ""connectors"" - those folks that know everyone, are involved in everything and make things blossom. (Who knows, maybe that's you!) Get the word out, and ask those folks to help you spread the word to their networks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Summoning of Everyman - Komedien om Enhver<br/><br/>
</h2>
<p><em>(Se Dansk tekst nedenfor)</em></p>
<p><em>Facebook: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/komedienomenhver"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/komedienomenhver</a></em></p>
<p><br/> At the end of February 2013, the students at Theatre School Holberg, Copenhagen, suddenly <strong>lost all their teachers</strong>. The board of the school fired our artistic directors and hired a new school leader, who fired the rest of our teachers. He thought that was smart – we thought it was ridiculous, that in only a couple of days, we went from stopping our beloved Shakespeare rehearsals to returning to an arrogant and hostile atmosphere at the school. We didn’t sign up for that. We didn’t pay for that. And we protested. So they just closed our school, leaving us behind with nothing, and then opened it up again, with the same name. And they seem to think that they have no obligations towards us. (No worries though, we have pressed charges)</p>
<p><br/><br/> But we couldn’t stay stuck in those people's political scheme and had to move on and make some theatre. And the decision was to put on the play “The Summoning of Everyman” by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, which will have its premiere at the 5th of June 2013 in the Gethsemane church, Copenhagen.</p>
<p><br/><br/> The Summoning of Everyman tells the story of Everyman, a shopaholic rich-bitch, who, in her late 30s, is suddenly summoned to answer for her deeds; in her entourage we also find her young gold-digging, coke-snorting fuck-buddy, Sigfried and her BFF, whose arrogance is only to be overshadowed by her stupidity. </p>
<p><br/> When Death shows up at one of her parties, Everyman gets only a few hours to balance out her Karmic Account, or she will end up in hell. </p>
<p><br/><br/> Not only is she about to die and go to hell, but also has to answer the question: <br/> “How do you clean up your shit in only a couple of hours?” – That’s a tough one!</p>
<p><br/><br/> Only to make things more interesting for Everyman, she has to deal with a psychopathic bible-basher - her beloved mother, Dorotha, a crazy, begging Gipsy-Polack hypocrite mutant, and even the cousins, Satan and Mammon appear to her on her last day on Earth. The play is filled with bizarre characters, which put our own human existence and ethics into perspective – in a church where the taboos are broken and the fun is free for all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a plead. We need your help. We need your help to show Copenhagen that real artists do not let political schemes and internal powerplay ruin their work - it makes us only stronger.</p>
<p><br/> Please share this - that's also helping alot. Your mom's friend could see this on Facebook and think: ""Holy mother of Jesus, this is so important!"" And boom - your moms friend is now a producer! Thanks to you!</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Komedien om Enhver </strong></p>
<p><span>Gethsemanekirken i perioden 5-9 juni, 2013. </span></p>
<p><span>Kvinden </span><span>Enhver </span><span>var rig på aktier og fede tasker, og havde både venner, der drak hende under bordet, og en fræk toy-boy hun kunne lege med om aftenen. Da </span><span>Enhver </span><span>får påbud af Døden om, at hun skal på den rejse, hvorfra ingen vender tilbage, laver hun et desperat forsøg på at tage alt det hun ejer med sig, men finder hurtigt ud af at livets pølse er speget – ligesom alle hendes venner. </span></p>
<p><span>”Komedien om Enhver” </span><span>er en klassisk komedie, bygget over middelalderens kirkelige Mysterie- og Moralitetsspil. Det er skrevet i 1911 af Hugo von Hofmannsthal, og handler om livets store moralske og eksistentielle spørgsmål; om dødsangsten og troen, om dyder og laster, om penge og venskab. </span></p>

The Summoning of Everyman - Komedien om Enhver

(Se Dansk tekst nedenfor)
Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/komedienomenhver
 At the end of February 2013, the students at Theatre School Holberg, Copenhagen, suddenly lost all their teachers. The board of the school fired our artistic directors and hired a new school leader, who fired the rest of our teachers. He thought that was smart – we thought it was ridiculous, that in only a couple of days, we went from stopping our beloved Shakespeare rehearsals to returning to an arrogant and hostile atmosphere at the school. We didn’t sign up for that. We didn’t pay for that. And we protested. So they just closed our school, leaving us behind with nothing, and then opened it up again, with the same name. And they seem to think that they have no obligations towards us. (No worries though, we have pressed charges)
 But we couldn’t stay stuck in those people's political scheme and had to move on and make some theatre. And the decision was to put on the play “The Summoning of Everyman” by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, which will have its premiere at the 5th of June 2013 in the Gethsemane church, Copenhagen.
 The Summoning of Everyman tells the story of Everyman, a shopaholic rich-bitch, who, in her late 30s, is suddenly summoned to answer for her deeds; in her entourage we also find her young gold-digging, coke-snorting fuck-buddy, Sigfried and her BFF, whose arrogance is only to be overshadowed by her stupidity. 
 When Death shows up at one of her parties, Everyman gets only a few hours to balance out her Karmic Account, or she will end up in hell. 
 Not only is she about to die and go to hell, but also has to answer the question:  “How do you clean up your shit in only a couple of hours?” – That’s a tough one!
 Only to make things more interesting for Everyman, she has to deal with a psychopathic bible-basher - her beloved mother, Dorotha, a crazy, begging Gipsy-Polack hypocrite mutant, and even the cousins, Satan and Mammon appear to her on her last day on Earth. The play is filled with bizarre characters, which put our own human existence and ethics into perspective – in a church where the taboos are broken and the fun is free for all.
 
This is a plead. We need your help. We need your help to show Copenhagen that real artists do not let political schemes and internal powerplay ruin their work - it makes us only stronger.
 Please share this - that's also helping alot. Your mom's friend could see this on Facebook and think: ""Holy mother of Jesus, this is so important!"" And boom - your moms friend is now a producer! Thanks to you!
 
What you will get for your money (Not to mention the fact that you keep our hopes, about coming professional actors, alive) See on the side, and at the bottom:

Komedien om Enhver 
Gethsemanekirken i perioden 5-9 juni, 2013. 
Kvinden Enhver var rig på aktier og fede tasker, og havde både venner, der drak hende under bordet, og en fræk toy-boy hun kunne lege med om aftenen. Da Enhver får påbud af Døden om, at hun skal på den rejse, hvorfra ingen vender tilbage, laver hun et desperat forsøg på at tage alt det hun ejer med sig, men finder hurtigt ud af at livets pølse er speget – ligesom alle hendes venner. 
”Komedien om Enhver” er en klassisk komedie, bygget over middelalderens kirkelige Mysterie- og Moralitetsspil. Det er skrevet i 1911 af Hugo von Hofmannsthal, og handler om livets store moralske og eksistentielle spørgsmål; om dødsangsten og troen, om dyder og laster, om penge og venskab. 
Stykket er sprængfyldt med bizarre karakterer: En stressramt Gud, Døden og hendes Baby, en sarkastisk Engel, en dødsangst Shopaholic, en snu Polak, en gold-digging Loverboy, Fætter Grådig, en feststemt Mammon, ja selv en forsmået Satan kommer på besøg i dette dramatiske festfyrværkeri, hvor alt er tilladt og intet er helligt. 
Komedien bliver opført i Gethsemane-kirken i perioden 5 – 9. juni 2013, og er en produktion af de tidligere elever på FILM+Teaterskolen Holberg.
Eleverne mistede deres ledelse og to hoved-lærere i februar 2013, da skolens bestyrelse fyrede dem fra den ene dag til den anden. Dermed var skolens to grundpiller fjernet. Efterfølgende blev en ny leder ansat, der valgte at fritstille resten af lærer og senere lukkede skolen.
Røvrendt og svigtet står vi, uden kostumer, sminke, øvelokaler, regi, lys og lyd. Men integriteten har vi stadigvæk og viljen til at skabe. Derfor beder vi jer om hjælp til at finansiere dette projekt, som vi brænder så meget for, og som har været med til at definere os – både som kunstnere og som mennesker. 
 
 
Engang var der en almægtig Gud.Op på et kors han hængte sin søn,Gav os nådesord og strenge bud.
Men nu, handler livet om Vuitton og kønsdele.
Ingen fattig jomfru sidder læng’re i løn
Så Gud gav os teatret til at ta’ pis på det hele!
At skabe og dele – det er vores vision.

<p>Please support our efforts by making a monetary gift to WIL Festival. Our performers step into the shoes of 16th century professionals and walk miles in them all summer long, discovering how Original Practice succeeds in the 21st century.</p>

<p>Of course we don't expect all our supporters to be substantial contributors. When you join us in the park, we'll ask you to drop a small contribution into a post-show bucket (our version of passing the hat), and if you are able to give more than spare change or cash on hand, we gladly accept a check or credit card on site.

<p>Many of our performers have begun to master the combination of text analysis, vocal and physical athleticism, and improvisation skills that cue script performance demands. Through a combination of training and rigorous experience, impossible to recreate without a viable company.</p>
<p>With the help of Ronni Lacroute, as well as The Swinford Family Foundation, we've been able to hire professional actors at competitive rates and find a home in the local theatre community.</p>
<p>We keep costs low so we can expand the reach of our season into more neighborhoods. Relative to the modern tradition of massive set construction and architectural verisimilitude, our universal set is lightweight, compact, and reusable.
