</h3><p>Short Summary</p>
<p>I have been a nurse for 23 years and have dedicated my
career to mothers and babies. I am also a neonatal nurse practitioner and my
dream has always been to improve the health of babies to the point where
neonatal intensive care units are no longer needed! I completed my doctorate
degree from Vanderbilt University’s School of Nursing in December. My research
project was to develop a survey for mothers that asks them if the
education they received before giving birth adequately prepared them for making
the best choices for them and their babies. I believe that by giving mothers
the information that they need at the right time and in a way that they can
understand and use will improve the health of mothers and babies. My survey was
developed using the latest evidence on patient satisfaction, childbirth education,
and health outcomes. There has been little research in improving childbirth
education since the 1990’s so this work is important and long overdue. By improving childbirth education we can better
prepare mothers and improve the morbidity and mortality of mothers and babies
in the United States and internationally!</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>I need to make my survey available for nurse educators to
use to improve their childbirth class curriculum and to incorporate culturally appropriate
information as appropriate. I was accepted to do a 30 minute oral presentation
at the 25<sup>th</sup> annual international Sigma Theta Tau (nursing honor
society) conference in Hong Kong in July, 2014 to present my research. I need
funding to pay for the travel and hotel accommodations to do so. I am so
excited to get to present my findings and survey to an international audience!
The cost of airfare, lodging, and conference tuition is $6000. If I do not meet
my goal I will use the funding to implement my survey in Atlanta, Georgia
hospitals.</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>While global rates of maternal mortality decreased 34%
between 1990 and 2008, maternal deaths <b>nearly
doubled</b> in the United States during the same period.  The infant death rate in the United States is
higher than the rate for most developed countries, due to a significantly
higher percentage of preterm births. In addition, considerable differences in
infant mortality rates between various racial and ethnic groups have persisted
and, in some cases, increased. Contributing factors include the changing
demographics of childbearing women, the decreased health status of the
Americans overall, low levels of health literacy, and decreased access to quality
health care information. My project will serve to improve access to quality
healthcare information. </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>I am willing to share my survey tool with organizations and
individuals that are interested in improving the quality of their childbirth or
prenatal education programs. Please contact me.</p>

</p><h1>In a Nutshell</h1>
<p>We have
started this campaign to develop support to move the Community Transitions
Project forward and develop training materials for the “Speaking” Civilian
transition workshop. This program has been highly successful and popular so far.
The “Speaking” Civilian workshop has been offered three times at Joint Base
Lewis-McChord, and is part of a recurring transition course. At this point, we
are looking to scale up. The resources generated by this campaign will support
3-4 people on a part-time basis to develop the training materials, a website,
and push the CTP and “Speaking” Civilian to the next level.</p>
<h1>Who is the Community
Transitions Project?</h1>
<p>The
Community Transitions Project (CTP) was founded on work done by Dylan Medina, a
Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in Seattle. Concerned over the
challenges facing service members as they reintegrate into civilian life, and
seeing massive funding cuts to transition services, Dylan recognized that his
research in how people learn to communicate and function in new communities
could help. Leah Rankin, Ann Shivers-McNair, and Olivia Hernandez, also
graduate students at the University of Washington, have joined Dylan to found
and advance the CTP. </p>
<p>Our Mission is to support the transitions
individuals make between communities by providing training that helps them
achieve greater agency and control as they make the transition. Currently we
are focusing on service members’ transitions between military and civilian
life, but we hope in the future to expand the mission to other groups that face
challenging transitions. </p>
<h1>What
is “Speaking” Civilian?</h1>
<p>“Speaking”
Civilian, and the CTP, differ from other transition programs because it focuses
on the often forgotten aspect of “fitting in.” This program draws on research
in Education, Rhetoric and Composition, and Cognitive Psychology to help
participants learn to see the cultural conventions of the communities they will
be entering. These individuals will then be in a better position to figure out
how to act and communicate in ways that “fit in.” Fitting is important because
failing to do so makes it difficult to find jobs and be a member of the
community. </p>
<h2>Training Outcomes</h2>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>To learn a theory of discourse that allows
service members to see culture as a system of conventions and practices that
they can learn.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>To develop an approach to analyzing the
conventions of unfamiliar communities.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>To gain an increased awareness of their own
resources and strategies for acting and communicating.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>To begin to learn how to make use of these
resources in civilian contexts.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>To develop a disposition that allows service
members to figure out how to integrate effectively into civilian communities. </p>
<h1>Where are we now?</h1>
<p>Over the last
year, Dylan has been able to provide a training for VetCorp volunteers and has
established the “Speaking” Civilian workshop at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. The
workshop was offered first as a pilot in November 2013, and thanks to positive
participant feedback, was incorporated as an important piece of a new
transition course, Northwest Edge. “Speaking” Civilian has since been offered
twice as part of Northwest Edge in 2014. It will be offered a third time in
June. </p>
<p>Additionally,
we have received requests for training materials so that components of “Speaking”
Civilian and the entire workshop can be available to a larger group of
transitioning service members. To be able to invest the time in creating these
training materials, we have set up this campaign to generate public support. </p>
<h1>The Plan—Moving Forward</h1>
<p>In response
to requests we have received for training materials so that “Speaking” Civilian
can be more widely available to transitioning service members, we have put
together this campaign to generate the public support we need to be able to
invest the time in creating these materials. Along with training materials, we
will work to build a web presence and continue to support instructors of the “Speaking”
Civilian workshop as part of Northwest Edge. </p>
<h2>Here’s our plan:</h2>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Further
develop the curriculum for use at other sites. This means work to generalize

<h1>The Impact</h1>
<p>The training
provided by the Community Transitions Project has already made a challenging
transition easier by helping service members learn how to figure out their fit
in civilian settings. This will allow them to remix the valuable knowledge,
skills, and experience they gained through their service for civilian
settings. With your support, the Community Transitions Project will be able to
reach more service members with the training that already has and will continue
to make a real difference in service members’ lives. </p>
<h1>Other Ways You Can Help</h1>
<p>While we’re
asking for funding in this campaign, there are other ways to get involved if
you can’t contribute financially.</p>
<p>Take a moment
to spread the word about this campaign! If you think it’s valuable, tell your
friends. Share the campaign on social media. Use the tools that we’re providing
to make some noise.</p>
<p>Most
importantly, consider how we in our communities welcome or ostracize newcomers.
Transition is largely about fit, and an open, accepting community makes fitting
in easier. The choice of whether a community is hostile or welcoming comes down
to us. </p>
<br/><p></p></div>","In a Nutshell
We have
started this campaign to develop support to move the Community Transitions
Project forward and develop training materials for the “Speaking” Civilian
transition workshop. This program has been highly successful and popular so far.
The “Speaking” Civilian workshop has been offered three times at Joint Base
Lewis-McChord, and is part of a recurring transition course. At this point, we
are looking to scale up. The resources generated by this campaign will support
3-4 people on a part-time basis to develop the training materials, a website,
and push the CTP and “Speaking” Civilian to the next level.
Who is the Community
Transitions Project?
The
Community Transitions Project (CTP) was founded on work done by Dylan Medina, a
Ph.D. student at the University of Washington in Seattle. Concerned over the
challenges facing service members as they reintegrate into civilian life, and
seeing massive funding cuts to transition services, Dylan recognized that his
research in how people learn to communicate and function in new communities
could help. Leah Rankin, Ann Shivers-McNair, and Olivia Hernandez, also
graduate students at the University of Washington, have joined Dylan to found
and advance the CTP. 
Our Mission is to support the transitions
individuals make between communities by providing training that helps them
achieve greater agency and control as they make the transition. Currently we
are focusing on service members’ transitions between military and civilian
life, but we hope in the future to expand the mission to other groups that face
challenging transitions. 
What
is “Speaking” Civilian?
“Speaking”
Civilian, and the CTP, differ from other transition programs because it focuses
on the often forgotten aspect of “fitting in.” This program draws on research
in Education, Rhetoric and Composition, and Cognitive Psychology to help
participants learn to see the cultural conventions of the communities they will
be entering. These individuals will then be in a better position to figure out
how to act and communicate in ways that “fit in.” Fitting is important because
failing to do so makes it difficult to find jobs and be a member of the
community. 
Training Outcomes
· 
To learn a theory of discourse that allows
service members to see culture as a system of conventions and practices that
they can learn.
· 
To develop an approach to analyzing the
conventions of unfamiliar communities.
· 
To gain an increased awareness of their own
resources and strategies for acting and communicating.
· 
To begin to learn how to make use of these
resources in civilian contexts.
· 
To develop a disposition that allows service
members to figure out how to integrate effectively into civilian communities. 
Where are we now?
Over the last
year, Dylan has been able to provide a training for VetCorp volunteers and has
established the “Speaking” Civilian workshop at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. The
workshop was offered first as a pilot in November 2013, and thanks to positive
participant feedback, was incorporated as an important piece of a new
transition course, Northwest Edge. “Speaking” Civilian has since been offered
twice as part of Northwest Edge in 2014. It will be offered a third time in
June. 
Additionally,
we have received requests for training materials so that components of “Speaking”
Civilian and the entire workshop can be available to a larger group of
transitioning service members. To be able to invest the time in creating these
training materials, we have set up this campaign to generate public support. 
The Plan—Moving Forward
In response
to requests we have received for training materials so that “Speaking” Civilian
can be more widely available to transitioning service members, we have put
together this campaign to generate the public support we need to be able to
invest the time in creating these materials. Along with training materials, we
will work to build a web presence and continue to support instructors of the “Speaking”
Civilian workshop as part of Northwest Edge. 
Here’s our plan:
· 
Further
develop the curriculum for use at other sites. This means work to generalize
the specifics of the “Speaking” Civilian that is part of Northwest Edge.
· 
Produce
a training manual that will include syllabi, original readings, sample
exercises, and an instructor guide to the theory behind the workshop. 
· 
Produce
a training video that demonstrates some of the central components of “Speaking”
Civilian.
· 
Build
a website to distribute these training materials and to act as a hub for the
Community Transitions Project and future “Speaking” Civilian instructors.
· 
All
materials will be produced in electronic format for easy distribution. We
believe in open access, and so will work to ensure that the materials are
freely available.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are Emily and Danielle and we belong to the most amazing church, which is Grace Family Church in Lutz Florida!!  God has offered us the chance to go on a missions trip to Ireland with our High School Youth Group and Missionary Ventures.</p>
<p>This missions trip will be reaching out and spreading the gospel to people in Sligo, Ireland.  We will also be learning more about the people there and their culture.  Many of you may think why Ireland? Ireland isn't a country impoverished. The reason for this mission trip to Ireland is purely spiritual. Did you know that less than 1% of Ireland’s population professes a relationship with Jesus Christ?  The goal of this mission trip is to help with outreaches in towns and communities, reaching people with the message of Jesus Christ, helping aide local pastors' ambitions of doing God's work and to see leadership developed and spread.</p>
<p>While God has opened up a door for us to develop more compassionate hearts for His people around the world, we will need prayers and funding to go on this missions trip. The cost of the trip for each of us is $2,500.00.</p>
<p>We look forward to doing God's work in Ireland!  Thank you for your support, God Bless!</p>

<h3>BRING JACK HOME</h3>
<p>Jack Culolias is a first year student at ASU, and has been missing for more than two  weeks. As of right now we still really don't know much about his dissappearance or how it came about. We've found a shoe and a picture, but the family is still looking for closure. All we know is that we are missing a great friend and family member, and a wonderful person to be around. Jack is still out there and he needs our help.</p>
<p>Jack's last reported sighting was outside of the Cadillac Ranch restaurant in Tempe Marketplace around 11 o'clock. He was escorted out of the restaurant around then, and nothing else has been reported. With such little information available about this incident, we need ALL the support we can possibly get to help bring our boy home. He is around 6 feet tall, and has brown hair and brown eyes. </p>
<p>With all of this going on, Jack's family has gone through so much, and I can only imagine how they are coping with this. More and more days pass with no news, and all we can pray for at this time is closure. His family needs extreme love and support right now, and so do his brothers. An entire community has been brought together by this event, and its all because of the wonderful smile of Jack. Jack has influenced more people than he may never know, and thats a true testament to the kind of awesome person he is. </p>
<p>Our contribution requests are simple. We don't need much, just a lot of people to make small contributions, although we will take as much as you can give. The last page we created raised over 6,000 dollars in twelve days, mostly in dollar and 5 dollar contributions. Although Jack's family had to return home, they are in desperate need of any help possible. This money has been used to provide his families travel accomodations, awareness items like T-shirts and bands, private investigators, lawyers, and in the worst circumstances, funeral accomodations. </p>
<p>If you cannot make a financial contribution, please contribute in other ways! We have a facebook group and are trending on twitter, and these resources can be used to get involved in hundreds of ways. If you have any information or photographs please contact Tempe police. Also, if you have any contribution ideas post them on the facebook page. </p>
<p>With all this being said, we appreciate everyones continued support and concerns. It's been so amazing to see every one come together like this, and we need this love right now. Keep spreading the word and lets BRING OUR BOY JACK HOME. </p>

In the media I create I use the International Phonetic Alphabet to reflect the language as my ancestors spoke it.  There are elders who can claim our language is their first language, but there isn’t enough of those speakers to hear our language spoken in everyday life.  With your help I will continue to encourage, through social media, a growing interest to learn our language before it becomes silent.  I currently post to facebook on Nuuchahnulth Speaker, a page I created to connect to people who want to hear the language. I would like to continue this work and expand it. The expanded  work would be to process more material, so that everyone can have more frequent exposure to hearing our language through more frequent posting.  It's a valuable participation to come and listen because it will imprint the Nuuchahnulth language patterns.  With your donation I will also upgrade equipment, pay honorariums to an elder speaker for assistance, as well as attain software to explore creating animated language lessons.  To share my appreciation your perk will say “hii-shuk-ish tsa-waak / Everything is One”,  a Nuučan̓uł belief.  I appreciate your support, share the campaign!  ƛeekoo, ƛeekoo. 
 
The target for the L.O.L campaign is $25,000. Fortunately, I am not asking for that whole $25,000 dollars from just you. Unless, your generous heart also has deep pockets:) Suggested donation amounts (through paypal or credit card) are between $5-$25,000. They each come with a donation perk . If you can’t part with $5 right now, please share this campaign with 5 most likely people to donate on your facebook. There is a higher chance for this fundraising campaign to become a “featured campaign” and greater chance for its success if it’s a featured campaign. It nurtures our spirit to hear our own language. And it will tell the world how we describe life, how rich our culture is. ƛeekoo, ƛeekoo

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Aujenee' and I have been selected by People to People and my teachers to be a People to People Student Ambassador!  Our destination is ""Canadian Cultures"". I am a 5th grader at a charter school and have always been allowed to progress at my own pace.  This manner of education has allowed me to excel academically.  I am an A student and love school, helping people, and managing through daily challenges.  I mention challenges because the past two years have been extremely hard for me and my family.  My brother was murdered and we are ""finally"" trying to move forward the best that we can.  I want to go so badly on this educational venture and just begin to 'live' again.  Not only will this excursion allow me to do that, it will also allow me to grow while experiencing another culture. I NEED to go on this trip!  I am soooo excited about the opportunities to learn and help others while in Canada.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Won't you <strong>PLEASE</strong> help me attend this 12 day once in a lifetime excursion?  Although I have worked hard for the past several months I have been unable to reach my goal of $5000.00.  I have raised $1500.00 so far through fundraiser campaigns, bake sales, gift wrapping, working as an actress, and forgoing Christmas gifts in exchange for sponsorships.  I am still trying very hard but need YOUR help!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you help fund my trip it would not only benefit me.  My community, school, friends, peers, girl scout troop, kids church, and everyone I meet will benefit as well.  You probably guessed it by now...I'm a big talker!  I'm excited about learning through experience about Canada, its' history, people, and their culture. As an Ambassador it is my duty to share this knowledge.  To me it is an opportunity to learn not about our differences BUT the indifferences amongst us.  We are ALL more alike than unalike.  We are not threats to one another, we are brothers and sisters, equals willing to accept one another as friends.  As your Ambassador i will befriend everyone I meet and leave them with a warm feeling of genuine friendship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This excursion will allow me to prove this as well as prepare me for my future. It will teach me to be independent and regain trust in others, meet new people that I may have never met, become a leader and speaker of the acceptance of others that don't look or act like you, and it's going to look good on my college resume (0:  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This opportunity was not handed to me, I earned it through studying and hard work.  I love school and understand its importance.  I don't take this priviledge lightly.  I know it costs a lot of money. Unfortunately, my mom just can't swing it alone.  She is supporting me and helping the best she can but I don't want to stress her further.  I want to lift her spirits by making her proud of me through this honor. Thank you for helping me and believeing in me!</p>

<p>Hello everyone, thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>
<p>We want to put up the best conference on Breaktrough Energy ever.<br/></p>
<p>Due to popular demand and much enthusiasm we have already started planning the 2013 conference. This time we are bringing GlobalBEM to the United States! <br/></p>
<p><strong>Here is where you come in:</strong></p>
<p>We didn't break even with our 2012 conference, but thanks to private sponsors we were able to make it happen. That’s why this time we want to get YOU involved and support the cause. We want to spread the word about breakthrough energy technologies and its implications. We can't make this conference happen and bring this wealth of information to the world without your help.</p>
<p>On top of our running costs/operational costs, we have an urgent milestone that we need your help with. Our goal is to raise $30,000 with this campaign to cover airline and hotel reservations for our speakers and team.</p>
<p>Can you envision a world free of fossil fuels, that is both economically sustainable and environmentally responsible?</p>

<p>One of the major goals of GlobalBEM is organizing conferences to give exposure and bring awareness about Breakthrough Energy. Last November we held our first very successful conference, and we struggled to make it happen. With a combination of no funding, and slow ticket sales, we we almost didn't make the budget and being able to present the mind blowing program we had put together for our audience. Ultimately, because of private Dutch sponsors we were able to make it happen. The 2012 Hilversum, Holland conference was informative, entertaining and unique on many levels.</p>
<p>Our 2013 conference will be held at the University of Colorado in Boulder from October 10th-12<sup>th</sup>, 2013. </p>

<p>Global Breakthrough Energy Movement is an independent foundation driven by volunteers with the primary goal to facilitate the widespread awareness and use of Breakthrough energy technology and its implications. </p>
<p>What began as a small group quickly evolved into a wide international network of people from diverse backgrounds including scientists, researchers, academics, artists, and business holders. While the core team is based in the Netherlands, the network spans our entire globe.</p>
<p>We define Breakthrough Energy Technology as an abundant energy source, which produces zero-emissions, that can provide clean, safe, healthy, reliable and affordable energy solutions.</p>
<p>Many of these technologies are based on principles of advanced physics, and include, but are not limited to — over-unity devices, magnet motors, cold fusion, vortex, zero-point and advanced hydrogen.</p>
<p>GlobalBEM will support and promote promising inventions in the field of Breakthrough Energy with the objective to bring these solutions to available applications without restriction.   </p>
<p>GlobalBEM will facilitate and coordinate the innovators’ initiatives in providing comprehensive evaluations in a professional and confidential environment.  </p>
<p>GlobalBEM will create a tantalizing platform to inform and attract all stakeholders to bring these technologies to full production and use to a common acceptance and realization. </p>
<p>GlobalBEM will use its momentum and reputation to promote funding/donation initiatives, research and marketing in close relation to the interests of stakeholders.</p>
<p> <strong>We defined three main goals for GlobalBEM:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Conferences: </strong> Annually unite great minds and innovators from all over the world to share their knowledge, present their technologies and discuss further steps for development and deployment of Breakthrough Energy Technologies. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Educational Resource Document: </strong>To create a rich and widely accessible media resource for the purpose of informing and activating the broader public about the history, mechanics and implications of Breakthrough Energy Technologies.</p>

An uncle on death row and a mother with terminal cancer had made De'Jaun wise beyond his years.<br/><br/>The more I interacted with De'Jaun over the years that followed, (as I got more involved in Troy's case and began writing a book with his mother Martina) the more I realized--this is a special young man, with incredible gifts to offer the world. Troy, Martina, and Virginia all knew it--their dearest wish was for De'Jaun to get a top-rate education and to develop his full potential.<br/><br/>I am asking you to help De'Jaun realize his potential, utilize his gifts, and pursue the opportunity of a lifetime.<br/><br/>De'Jaun has been accepted to Morehouse College, where Martin Luther King Jr. once studied. It is the school of his dreams.<br/><br/>After all that this young man has lived through in his 18 years, he deserves so much to have the chance to pursue his goals (which are to obtain a dual degree in electrical engineering and business) at an educational institution that is not only excellent and arduous, but that shares De'Jaun's commitment to social justice and social change.<br/><br/>De'Jaun needs our help to fulfill his dreams, and to realize Troy, Martina, and Virginia's hopes for him.</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>My name is Kimberly Nguyen. I am a poet and a math student at Carleton University. This year, I will be participating in the Alternative Spring Break program at school.</p>
<p>Here is a brief description of what it's all about (directly from Carleton's website):<br/>""Participants will travel to Vancouver, British Columbia where they will focus on the issue of urban poverty within Canada. The city of Vancouver grew from its oldest neighourhood – the Downtown Eastside, which is the poorest postal code in Canada. Students will visit the streets of this neighourhood which are a transitional home for thousands, serve with a variety of partners in the city focusing on anti-poverty and housing-rights organizations, and will have the opportunity to listen to guest speakers on these issues.""</p>
<p>I will be staying in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver during reading week, which is from February 16th to 24th, with my ASB group from Carleton. During that week, we will be working with local partners and providing services in the community. We will be visiting Insite, North America's first legal supervised injection site, and we will be talking to sex workers to learn about these issues.</p>
<p>This will be a great opportunity for me to learn and experience something I am passionate about, ""first world"" poverty. As a poet, it is very important for me to speak upon things which people need to hear about but usually don't. My goals as a poet are to provoke thought and inspire, and also to educate. To be able to do these things, it is crucial for me to not only know, but to understand. This trip will definitely inspire me, and hopefully help me create art that can inspire others.</p>
<p>Every donation to this campaign will be a part of making that possible.</p>
<p><br/>To donate directly to the program (either to me personally OR to the general fund for other students as well), you can visit this link:<br/><a href=""https://cu-fyeo.ca/programs/asb/donate.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://cu-fyeo.ca/programs/asb/donate.php</a></p>
<p>To learn more about the program, you can click here:<br/><a href=""http://www6.carleton.ca/seo/community-service-learning/alternative-spring-break/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www6.carleton.ca/seo/community-service-learning/alternative-spring-break/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Flying to the other side of the country is not cheap.</p>
<p>This trip is going to cost $2000 (I put my goal as 2180 because this site charges a 9% fee), which is just over two months work of work for me, as an overnight cashier at Loblaws (before taxes and deductions).</p>
<p>The money goes directly to Carleton's ASB program and it covers my flight, stay, and meals for the week (so basically everything I'd need for that week). I will be going for the week of February 16 - 24, 2013.</p>
<p>What's in it for you:</p>
<p>10$ - You will get a spoken word/music/cover CD that I am working on.</p>
<p>20$ - You will get that CD, and I will make a drawing/painting of whatever   you want.</p>
<p>50$ - You will get the above things PLUS I will write a song for you about anything you want, post it on youtube and give you a shoutout.</p>
<p>100$ - All of the above PLUS I will sing a song for you live and buy you dinner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If I don't reach my goal</strong> by then, whatever donations I receive <strong>will still help</strong> reduce my fees. <strong>If I do go over my goal, </strong>the donations I receive will go to helping me to travel to Vancouver again in April for the Canadian Individual Poetry Slam (where I will be representing Ottawa's Urban Legends poetry slam and competing for the National Champion title and a spot at World's Individual Poetry Slam).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A question you may ask is:<strong> ""Why don't we just donate the money to the hungry?""</strong></p>
<p>If you feed a man for now, he'll go hungry again later.</p>
<p>Giving money to the poor is a nice gesture, and it may help, but only temporarily at best. If you walk around downtown, just handing money out to people you think need it, you won't see where it goes. It is possible that people will use your money for drugs or alcohol, but realistically, you can't expect someone to go and pay rent with the toonie you just tossed them. A better way to donate is through organizations like the Food Bank, but even then, their website even says '<strong>Money doesn't end hunger'</strong>.</p>
<p>Not only do I want to make a change, I would like to make a lasting impact. I really feel like it's not extremely unrealisticto do so, and this experience will give me a lot of ideas on how and where to start. It will mean a lot to me to be able to experience actually working with this community first hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another question you may have is: <strong>""How do we know we can trust you?""</strong></p>
<p>For those who know me, you know my intentions are pure. As for those who don't, I have provided a link in the summary section for you to read more about the ASB program and a link where you can donate to other students as well. I have also included a video of one of my poems, and I will attach another poem at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you believe in me, but don't have the money, you can help me out by spreading the word about my campaign. Share it, tweet it, put it on your tumblr, tell everyone you know. </p>

<h2>Hunger Games                                 </h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 300px;"">   -a poem by Kimbit</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 300px;""> </p>
<p>If only we could care for stray humans half as much as we cared for stray cats.<br/>If only we paid half as much attention to the homeless man who mentions that any change we spare can help him<br/>To buy a meal because he's hungry and he can't afford to pay that.</p>
<p>You see, with stray cats,<br/>When they follow us around, <br/>We don't seem to mind so much.<br/>We may even stop just to pet them, try to befriend them;<br/>We don't mind so much when they want our attention<br/>While the guy lying there is dying to get some, <br/>But he dares not approach us because he knows we don't let him<br/>So much as make eye contact or say hi, let alone get in<br/>A few words to explain why he's out here begging</p>
<p>So he doesn't even bother, he just sits there in silence.<br/>Keeping calm, he carries on, blending in with the sidewalk<br/>And whenever I walk by, I feel like this is somehow my fault,<br/>So I stop and I talk to him for a minute,<br/>Or rather, I listen<br/>To see how he's gotten here and see what I can give him.<br/>But at the same time, I'm cautious because some guys can talk us<br/>Into giving them change not for food, but narcotics.</p>
<p>Well, sir,<br/>If you're hungry, that's a McDonalds, just there<br/>Let me get you some food - oh, you want change for bus fare?<br/>All right, that's cool, too; I'll get you some tickets from the Zesty's.<br/>Oh.. you still just want the change, huh? Well then you better forget me.<br/>I refused to be responsible for helping you get high<br/>And you just ruined anything possible like that for the next guy.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
 
Hello all,
My name is Kimberly Nguyen. I am a poet and a math student at Carleton University. This year, I will be participating in the Alternative Spring Break program at school.
Here is a brief description of what it's all about (directly from Carleton's website):""Participants will travel to Vancouver, British Columbia where they will focus on the issue of urban poverty within Canada. The city of Vancouver grew from its oldest neighourhood – the Downtown Eastside, which is the poorest postal code in Canada. Students will visit the streets of this neighourhood which are a transitional home for thousands, serve with a variety of partners in the city focusing on anti-poverty and housing-rights organizations, and will have the opportunity to listen to guest speakers on these issues.""
I will be staying in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver during reading week, which is from February 16th to 24th, with my ASB group from Carleton. During that week, we will be working with local partners and providing services in the community. We will be visiting Insite, North America's first legal supervised injection site, and we will be talking to sex workers to learn about these issues.
This will be a great opportunity for me to learn and experience something I am passionate about, ""first world"" poverty. As a poet, it is very important for me to speak upon things which people need to hear about but usually don't. My goals as a poet are to provoke thought and inspire, and also to educate. To be able to do these things, it is crucial for me to not only know, but to understand. This trip will definitely inspire me, and hopefully help me create art that can inspire others.
Every donation to this campaign will be a part of making that possible.
To donate directly to the program (either to me personally OR to the general fund for other students as well), you can visit this link:https://cu-fyeo.ca/programs/asb/donate.php
To learn more about the program, you can click here:http://www6.carleton.ca/seo/community-service-learning/alternative-spring-break/
 
 


What We Need & What You Get
Flying to the other side of the country is not cheap.
This trip is going to cost $2000 (I put my goal as 2180 because this site charges a 9% fee), which is just over two months work of work for me, as an overnight cashier at Loblaws (before taxes and deductions).
The money goes directly to Carleton's ASB program and it covers my flight, stay, and meals for the week (so basically everything I'd need for that week). I will be going for the week of February 16 - 24, 2013.
What's in it for you:
10$ - You will get a spoken word/music/cover CD that I am working on.
20$ - You will get that CD, and I will make a drawing/painting of whatever   you want.
50$ - You will get the above things PLUS I will write a song for you about anything you want, post it on youtube and give you a shoutout.
100$ - All of the above PLUS I will sing a song for you live and buy you dinner.
 
If I don't reach my goal by then, whatever donations I receive will still help reduce my fees. If I do go over my goal, the donations I receive will go to helping me to travel to Vancouver again in April for the Canadian Individual Poetry Slam (where I will be representing Ottawa's Urban Legends poetry slam and competing for the National Champion title and a spot at World's Individual Poetry Slam).
 
 


The Impact
A question you may ask is: ""Why don't we just donate the money to the hungry?""
If you feed a man for now, he'll go hungry again later.
Giving money to the poor is a nice gesture, and it may help, but only temporarily at best. If you walk around downtown, just handing money out to people you think need it, you won't see where it goes. It is possible that people will use your money for drugs or alcohol, but realistically, you can't expect someone to go and pay rent with the toonie you just tossed them. A better way to donate is through organizations like the Food Bank, but even then, their website even says 'Money doesn't end hunger'.
Not only do I want to make a change, I would like to make a lasting impact. I really feel like it's not extremely unrealisticto do so, and this experience will give me a lot of ideas on how and where to start. It will mean a lot to me to be able to experience actually working with this community first hand.
 
Another question you may have is: ""How do we know we can trust you?""
For those who know me, you know my intentions are pure. As for those who don't, I have provided a link in the summary section for you to read more about the ASB program and a link where you can donate to other students as well. I have also included a video of one of my poems, and I will attach another poem at the bottom of the page.
 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you believe in me, but don't have the money, you can help me out by spreading the word about my campaign. Share it, tweet it, put it on your tumblr, tell everyone you know. 
 
 
 
 
Hunger Games                                 
   -a poem by Kimbit
 
If only we could care for stray humans half as much as we cared for stray cats.If only we paid half as much attention to the homeless man who mentions that any change we spare can help himTo buy a meal because he's hungry and he can't afford to pay that.
You see, with stray cats,When they follow us around, We don't seem to mind so much.We may even stop just to pet them, try to befriend them;We don't mind so much when they want our attentionWhile the guy lying there is dying to get some, But he dares not approach us because he knows we don't let himSo much as make eye contact or say hi, let alone get inA few words to explain why he's out here begging
So he doesn't even bother, he just sits there in silence.Keeping calm, he carries on, blending in with the sidewalkAnd whenever I walk by, I feel like this is somehow my fault,So I stop and I talk to him for a minute,Or rather, I listenTo see how he's gotten here and see what I can give him.But at the same time, I'm cautious because some guys can talk usInto giving them change not for food, but narcotics.
Well, sir,If you're hungry, that's a McDonalds, just thereLet me get you some food - oh, you want change for bus fare?All right, that's cool, too; I'll get you some tickets from the Zesty's.Oh.. you still just want the change, huh? Well then you better forget me.I refused to be responsible for helping you get highAnd you just ruined anything possible like that for the next guy.
You see, stray cats don't lieOr try to play us like that,So it might be understandle why we would handle them better,But it's still pretty messed up how Life for some are better at an animal shelter,How some people's dreams are to be treated like an animal;They see those ""Water For Your Dog"" bowls and wish that their cup could be just half as full
Why is it that when speaking of hunger, people only refer to the kids starving in AfricaAnd neglect the fact that kids are here, starving in our capital.It's factual, I'll have you knowThat kids make up 37% of people who use food banks.That's out of 45,000 people Per month, here in Ottawa!
You don't have to do math to tell that this don't add up.How are so many still starving in a city so developped?They are right under our noses, but we look up too much to notice.Trying to keep our own bellies swollen where we keep our focus.And I don't even know 45,000 folks, butThat's 5.5 per cent of the city's population,And if we can't get that down to zero, Then how do we expect to get rid of ""third world"" starvation?
Now, don't get me wrong... I'm not suggesting that we stop trying or give up.I just wanted to emphasize on how much this sucks.And there's no way I can single-handedly put an end to this;If only I posessed the power of periods following sentences.However, the power I do posess is in my penmanship;How legible I light these lines, write these rhymes, and make clear these messages.Telling it just how it is, trying to make a difference,But I'm still pretty much powerless if I don't deliver this.Though perhaps the powers in parliament could try and push away this problem.Probably. I mean, I know they can, but don't, so I'll take a stand and speak upon it.
I could spend all day texting M-E-A-L to 45678But despite any donations made, the problem stays because dollarsAren't all that makes the calls on whether or not they're starving.This problem will only be solved when our hearts stop being hollow.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hello friends and family,</p>
<p>My name is Ty the father of the little girl in the pictures you see. The mother of my child is threatening to take my daughter away from me forever. I’ve talk to many different lawyers and they all believe that I should have sole custody of my little girl. I have been threatened by her many times. This includes, but not limited to, moving to Atlanta with my daughter and most recently, falsely accusing me of kidnapping when I pick my daughter up from now. So to protect myself, I’ve been forced to stay away from seeing my daughter since September 3, 2012. She’s six years old now and I may not have the joyous pleasure to see the last twelve years of her childhood. Your contribution will help me fight for this wonderful little girl and to bring her home to me where she belongs. I can’t express how bad it feels to be kept from the one thing that keeps you motivated to be a better person.</p>
<p>The entire $8000 will go directly to my legal fees. The reason it’s so high is because I’ve been stuck with paying two attorneys, my attorney and the GAL (my daughter’s attorney). I’ve been stuck with the higher bill for the GAL attorney fees because my daughter’s mother doesn’t work and has not been able to maintain stable employment since my daughter has been born. I’ve been sitting in quiet desperation for the last six years hoping and praying for a way to end this. I’m so grateful that I found this site where there’s a community of individuals that looks to help others in their time of need.</p>
<p>Any possible assistance you can offer will be greatly appreciated, whether it is donation of $10 or sharing this with your friends and family. The smile on that little girls face is all I care about at. This <a href=""http://depletion.blogspot.com/2011/03/effects-absent-fathers-have-on-female.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">article</a> is the reason I’m trying so hard to stay in my daughter’s life. So everything I raise will go to directly to the legal fees I will accrue in this custody battle.</p>
<p>As always, I sincerely thank you all,</p>
<p>Ty</p>

<p><b>·<span> 
</span>returns a percentage to local sports and
charities</b></p>
<p>That’s gotta be a triple, at least. </p>
<p>The<b> ProFile Baseball app</b> started <i>not</i>
in an Iowa cornfield but a lawyer’s boardroom. We were pitching a website for sports agents to
showcase their talent – basically a ballplayer trading card, with video
– and someone said, “What else could it do?” We brainstormed some more, knocked
a few things out of the park, ditched the lawyers, secured the rights and took it to the pros. </p><h3>This 3 min.

<p><b>“I would’ve given up my rent money for this!”</b> said Mark
Acre, former A’s pitcher. “Back when I was trying to make it to the Show,
something like this
would’ve been big!” Mark saw how easy it was to build your own profile,
demonstrate skill development and share it with potential scouts and coaches.
He helped us present it to Oakland A’s pitching coach<b> Gil Patterson</b> – while they were filming<b> <i>Moneyball</i>,</b> in fact – and Gil showed us
how he wanted the software
and dual-play video to function. (And now it does.)</p>
<p>And just like that, a cool, new, major league-inspired product ideal
for the $150 billion baseball market was born. </p>

So before
proceeding, I wondered how ProFile could help them, too?</span><br/></b></h3><p></p>
<p>Two ways, it turns out. </p>
<p>First, as Mark Acre recognized,<b> ProFile is a great way to
get noticed</b>. It creates clear, verified, objective stats and video which <i>any</i> kid, boy or girl, from Little League
through college, can share with the next level up. </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FHFIpEsJ2S_U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHFIpEsJ2S_U&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FHFIpEsJ2S_U%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>The sweet spot is for high school players. NCAA and MLB
rules forbid direct contact to players under seventeen.<b> But you <i>know</i> they’re looking</b>. That’s why parents
fork over thousands of dollars so their kids can be seen at expensive camps and
club tournaments. ProFile levels the field through its immediate, consistent,
easy-access data, showcasing
athletes as they earn direct access to the recruiters and scouts they want to
meet. Just like that, you’re in the game. <p></p>
<p>Secondly,
and just as importantly, <b>ProFile gives back to kids</b>. Instead of handing out a
simple scorekeeping app then charging users to attend expensive tournaments,
ProFile flips that.  We’ll charge a modest rate for our products, then
sponsor local, not-for-profit tournaments and sports clinics, splitting the
proceeds between the hosting team/league and their charity of choice. That’s the mom in me
talking.</p>
<p>And that’s my field of dreams. A home-run app for kids,
competitors and pros. A field-tested profit maker for the big leagues and, more
importantly, a chance for everyone with a dream to get their fair turn at the
plate. </p>
<p>It’s all teed up. Will you help me hit this out of the park?</p><p></p>
<br/><h3>Do you love a baseball player?</h3><p></p><p>Help them get connected with ProFile's Baseball App. There
is a gap in the baseball marketplace between athletes and the coaches and scouts who want to meet them. NCAA forbids recruiters and scouts from approaching young athletes before their Jr. year in high school, but college and major league coaches are interested in more information about athletes at an earlier age. Athletes want to meet the recruiters and scouts, but don't know how to go about it. ProFile provides the best way for them to directly connect.</p><p></p><h3>

<p>High school prospects feel like they may be missing out on opportunities and
parents are paying dearly ($4000 per year average) to give their kids an advantage in getting the

<li>ProFile was started by Diana Barrows, entrepreneur and fortune 500 marketing expert and JP Morgan, sales and marketing training/manager with ties to professional sports. JP worked with and trained our first sales representative: Marc Acre, former pitcher with the Oakland A's and through his contacts we met Coach Gil Patterson, who upon seeing the ProFile demo became very excited. Coach Gill joined in our efforts and was instrumental in guiding the design and functionality of the software from a power user's point of view. Coach Gil is now the Director of Pitching for the New York Yankees.  Together we have been working on this project for two years - completely self-funded! And we are SO close! We have tested the BETA version of the mobile App. We will have the i-Pad score keeping app ready to test in a couple of weeks. But we can't go to market until we finish the user interface design and the code for the look and feel of the ProFile Bio Pages. We need just $10,000 more to complete this phase and launch ProFile Baseball on all the App stores. After that, we strongly believe that the sales of the apps will fund our expansion into other sports. We began with baseball because it is the hardest, and most statistically intensive. Once we succeed with the baseball app, we can transfer the technology and everything we have learned to every other sport. This is going to be huge! <p><br/></p>
<ul><li>So, for every contribution over $10 to the funding of Profile, and your feedback on testing the app, ProFile will list your name in the appreciation section of the website and on the app. ProFile will also provide a FREE subscription and use of the ProFile Baseball Mobile App for one year. </li></ul>

<p></p></div>",""" If you build it, we will come ""                                                            Believe
it or not, major league teams are already asking about our ProFile Baseball product,
sort of like the Voice whispering to farmer Ray Kinsella in Field of Dreams.
I’m a high-heeled Creative Director/Marketing type, but here’s my dream – a custom app that: 
· 
helps young players chase their dreams
· 
taps into the Moneyball technology boom ($3.5bil and growing)
· 
returns a percentage to local sports and
charities
That’s gotta be a triple, at least. 
The ProFile Baseball app started not
in an Iowa cornfield but a lawyer’s boardroom. We were pitching a website for sports agents to
showcase their talent – basically a ballplayer trading card, with video
– and someone said, “What else could it do?” We brainstormed some more, knocked
a few things out of the park, ditched the lawyers, secured the rights and took it to the pros. This 3 min. Video shows how ProFile Apps work.
“I would’ve given up my rent money for this!” said Mark
Acre, former A’s pitcher. “Back when I was trying to make it to the Show,
something like this
would’ve been big!” Mark saw how easy it was to build your own profile,
demonstrate skill development and share it with potential scouts and coaches.
He helped us present it to Oakland A’s pitching coach Gil Patterson – while they were filming Moneyball, in fact – and Gil showed us
how he wanted the software
and dual-play video to function. (And now it does.)
And just like that, a cool, new, major league-inspired product ideal
for the $150 billion baseball market was born. 
But, I'm also a mom... and I always think of kids. So before
proceeding, I wondered how ProFile could help them, too?
Two ways, it turns out. 
First, as Mark Acre recognized, ProFile is a great way to
get noticed. It creates clear, verified, objective stats and video which any kid, boy or girl, from Little League
through college, can share with the next level up. 
The sweet spot is for high school players. NCAA and MLB
rules forbid direct contact to players under seventeen. But you know they’re looking. That’s why parents
fork over thousands of dollars so their kids can be seen at expensive camps and
club tournaments. ProFile levels the field through its immediate, consistent,
easy-access data, showcasing
athletes as they earn direct access to the recruiters and scouts they want to
meet. Just like that, you’re in the game. 
Secondly,
and just as importantly, ProFile gives back to kids. Instead of handing out a
simple scorekeeping app then charging users to attend expensive tournaments,
ProFile flips that.  We’ll charge a modest rate for our products, then
sponsor local, not-for-profit tournaments and sports clinics, splitting the
proceeds between the hosting team/league and their charity of choice. That’s the mom in me
talking.
And that’s my field of dreams. A home-run app for kids,
competitors and pros. A field-tested profit maker for the big leagues and, more
importantly, a chance for everyone with a dream to get their fair turn at the
plate. 
It’s all teed up. Will you help me hit this out of the park?
Do you love a baseball player?Help them get connected with ProFile's Baseball App. There
is a gap in the baseball marketplace between athletes and the coaches and scouts who want to meet them. NCAA forbids recruiters and scouts from approaching young athletes before their Jr. year in high school, but college and major league coaches are interested in more information about athletes at an earlier age. Athletes want to meet the recruiters and scouts, but don't know how to go about it. ProFile provides the best way for them to directly connect.
Give them a better way to get a sport scholarship
High school prospects feel like they may be missing out on opportunities and
parents are paying dearly ($4000 per year average) to give their kids an advantage in getting the
attention of colleges or scouts at year-round club ball tournaments. 
Pros Have been struggling with complicated, and expensive
software to track play and stats and have been paying for licensing on software they will never own.Like Money Ball for High School Athletes...Our contacts in MLB tell us that coaches want an integrated training solution with a direct communication tool between players and scouts to instruct athletes and team
members in a closed loop system – nothing has worked until ProFile, as an all-in-one
solution. ProFile provides a beautifully consistent and professional way to
present an athlete's achievements easily and affordable. All-the-while putting the information and reports into standardized formats that are easy to search, compare and provide the verification scouts and managers want.With Dual Playing Video Comparisons
Too much time and money ($35,000,000 annually) is spent on
scouting prospects that do not really perform at the level claimed –

that has taken the most ordinary of English dwellings – a three-bedroomed, semi-detached,

With a name that means ‘the

it is a growing <b>community venue</b> that serves as an <b>inspirational wonderland

Talliston House & Gardens is a project
that has taken the most ordinary of English dwellings – a three-bedroomed, semi-detached,
ex-council house in Essex – and over two and a half decades has painstakingly transformed it into a magical labyrinth of locations, each set in a
different time and place. After years of design, research, sourcing and construction, each
room or garden is infused with a rich story, incorporating over 1,650 antiques and authentic objects sourced from 27 countries across the globe.
With a name that means ‘the
hidden place’, Talliston is not just an interior design project. Instead,
it is a growing community venue that serves as an inspirational wonderland
for writers, artists, craftspeople, and anyone seeking the extraordinary within the ordinary.

And all
this has been accomplished by an ordinary team of people – all inspired by the project’s unique vision. The main living and dining room: BEFORE & AFTER
WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
Started in 1990, the Talliston
project has been solely funded by private monies. Yet recently, the culmination
of over two decades of design, sourcing and rebuilding is threatened due to
financial difficulties. Talliston House & Gardens is now seeking financial
support from anyone who wants to see this unique and magical place saved and
its future secured forever.
We know the ultimate funding goal is ambitious, but laid out below is every financial target we need to reach to save the project – and even a small amount for enough people will be enough to keep the project alive.We hope you’ll support Talliston
with your generous donation and become part of this unique and exciting
journey.

<p>I have begun to develop an inclusive school in the Volta Region of Ghana and am working with various organizations in Ghana to make this happen. Now I need to spread the message back home in the United States. $3,000 will provide a round trip ticket from Ghana to my home in New York State for regional lobbying efforts. It will also provide enough for me to travel to Washington, D.C., use public transportation to get to the meetings that have been prearranged, and purchase meals. I will save as much money as possible by staying with family members. If we do not reach our entire goal, we will still do everything we can to make this happen. If we make more than our goal, any excess money will go to our work with children with disabilities.</p>

</div> <p>Ever since I was little, I wanted to study photography. Ever since I was in high school, I wanted to work in Africa. These two dreams became a reality in 2002 when, as a graduate student at Savannah College of Art and Design, I was able to spend a six month internship in Ghana, West Africa documenting life in the small fishing village of Woe by photographing the people in all aspects of their lives. I also spent time teaching photography to some of the children. I fell in love with the people and the country. Many volunteers to Ghana say they are going to return, but few ever do. I was determined that I would go back. I finished my degree, worked to save money and returned to Ghana volunteering to teach photography in three secondary schools.  I began to see more and more of the needs of the people, and I was hooked. I was especially touched when I worked in a special needs class and saw the pride the students felt as they learned to do something that many of their peers could not. I decided to start a not-for-profit, Kekeli, Inc.,  and continue working with students in Ghana. (Kekeli means daylight in the Ewe language.)</p>
<p><b>Why I Work With Ghana's Students With Special Needs </b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438655765/d5okrfigta2kqx9nnws8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I learned quickly that children born in Ghana with special needs were often hidden away. Their parents were afraid of the stigma of having a child who was ""different,"" so they kept the child away from others. However, I also learned that these children often had much to offer, and I realized that education is as much a key to their development as it is to every child's. This led me to work towards the inclusion of children with special needs in the mainstream classrooms. We made slow, steady progress, but the work Kekeli has been doing with individual students can be multiplied if we develop an all-inclusive school where children with disabilities will learn alongside of all children.  To do this requires money. We already have support from two major organizations, one in Ho, Ghana and the other in Norwich, United Kingdom. But I need to return to the United States to work at raising money to begin and then to sustain this project.  Therefore, I need $3,000.</p>
<p><b>                                               Please Contribute!</b></p>
<p>Whatever you can give will help to start this inclusive school by enabling me to spread the word about the tremendous possibilities this school will create for students with disabilities. </p>
<p>I cannot emphasize enough how important this campaign is to the children and to their families. Picture these situations: <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">          </span></p>

<p><b>What I Have Done in the Past</b></p>
<p>I have created self-advocacy groups and parent advocacy groups to help children with disabilities and their families learn about their rights under Ghanaian law. This includes the right to an education.  I have worked with Ghana Educational Services and gained their support in promoting inclusive education within the schools, including providing special education teachers to work with students. I have worked with parents, teachers and disabled children to encourage them to work towards an education.</p>

These two girls were born deaf, while their sister does not have this disability.  Kekeli is helping to provide an education for the two ""Roses."" These are two of the children who will be       supported through this campaign.

                                              

                     


I have begun to develop an inclusive school in the Volta Region of Ghana and am working with various organizations in Ghana to make this happen. Now I need to spread the message back home in the United States. $3,000 will provide a round trip ticket from Ghana to my home in New York State for regional lobbying efforts. It will also provide enough for me to travel to Washington, D.C., use public transportation to get to the meetings that have been prearranged, and purchase meals. I will save as much money as possible by staying with family members. If we do not reach our entire goal, we will still do everything we can to make this happen. If we make more than our goal, any excess money will go to our work with children with disabilities.
These children take a break from class work.



Our budget:
Round-trip airfare (Delta/KLM) from Accra, Ghana to New York City    $2,094 Shuttle (round-trip plus tax & tip) from NYC to home near Albany, NY        200 Round-trip airfare (Southwest) to Baltimore and back to Albany                   256 Housing with a relative for one week in DC area (Hanover, MD)                           0 Commute from Hanover, MD-Washington, DC & meals during week            450                                                                                                                                             Total = $3,000
Your participation in helping us raise the money is vital: you can donate, you can spread the word to others and you can ask them to spread the word and donate, too! Everyone who donates will receive a little piece of Africa! (See our ""perks!"")
                                      How I Got Interested in Ghana
 Ever since I was little, I wanted to study photography. Ever since I was in high school, I wanted to work in Africa. These two dreams became a reality in 2002 when, as a graduate student at Savannah College of Art and Design, I was able to spend a six month internship in Ghana, West Africa documenting life in the small fishing village of Woe by photographing the people in all aspects of their lives. I also spent time teaching photography to some of the children. I fell in love with the people and the country. Many volunteers to Ghana say they are going to return, but few ever do. I was determined that I would go back. I finished my degree, worked to save money and returned to Ghana volunteering to teach photography in three secondary schools.  I began to see more and more of the needs of the people, and I was hooked. I was especially touched when I worked in a special needs class and saw the pride the students felt as they learned to do something that many of their peers could not. I decided to start a not-for-profit, Kekeli, Inc.,  and continue working with students in Ghana. (Kekeli means daylight in the Ewe language.)
Why I Work With Ghana's Students With Special Needs 


I learned quickly that children born in Ghana with special needs were often hidden away. Their parents were afraid of the stigma of having a child who was ""different,"" so they kept the child away from others. However, I also learned that these children often had much to offer, and I realized that education is as much a key to their development as it is to every child's. This led me to work towards the inclusion of children with special needs in the mainstream classrooms. We made slow, steady progress, but the work Kekeli has been doing with individual students can be multiplied if we develop an all-inclusive school where children with disabilities will learn alongside of all children.  To do this requires money. We already have support from two major organizations, one in Ho, Ghana and the other in Norwich, United Kingdom. But I need to return to the United States to work at raising money to begin and then to sustain this project.  Therefore, I need $3,000.
                                               Please Contribute!
Whatever you can give will help to start this inclusive school by enabling me to spread the word about the tremendous possibilities this school will create for students with disabilities. 
I cannot emphasize enough how important this campaign is to the children and to their families. Picture these situations:           
        1) the smile on Mawunyo's face when she finally went to school after spending the first 16 years of her life sitting in a plastic laundry basket. Kekeli provided her with a wheelchair, built a ramp to her house and convinced the school that she could learn.

                                             

        2) the pride in David's mother's eyes as she encourages other parents to advocate for their children. With Kekeli's support, she spent months doing physical therapy exercises with him, and David was finally able to walk using crutches.

                                                

        3) the joy that Selorm felt when he was accepted into secondary school. He failed his junior secondary school exam, because he could not write clearly enough for his exam to be read, but with Kekeli's help in providing computer support, he was able to retake his exam and get into secondary school.
Now imagine those opportunities multiplying when children with disabilities have access to an inclusive school! Your donation can help make that happen!

This includes the right to an education.  I have worked with Ghana Educational Services and gained their support in promoting inclusive education within the schools, including providing special education teachers to work with students.

<h3><span>Short Summary</span></h3>
<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Punala Kiripitige, and I am a student at Saint Peter’s College, Adelaide, Australia. Saint Peter’s College promotes international mindedness, which is reflected in the International Baccalaureate Diploma. Approximately thirty male students, including myself, are undertaking this program. Completion of this program involves each student doing a project of community service. For this project of service five other students and myself are i<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">ntending to help provide stationery supplies for one school year to an underprivileged school in Sri Lanka.</span></p>
<p>As I was born in Sri Lanka, prior to migrating to Australia, I had seen many underprivileged children who walk distances as far as eight kilometres per day to get to school with their precious stationery. For those not living in underprivileged circumstances, the importance of stationary is not even considered. </p>
<p>As the Sri Lankan government provides textbooks for schooling, it is the children's responsibility to buy stationery for themselves. Many parents of these children are themselves finding life enduring many hardships and simply not earn enough money to even feed the family. Given that we are fortunate enough to live in a privileged country, with high quality education, I think it is absolutely vital that we help those who cannot afford to live their lives the same ways as us.</p>
<p>I would like us combined together to achieve a total of $2000AUD so that we can provide stationery for one whole year level to an underprivileged school in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>If we could reach that goal it would help a lot of young people!</p>
<p>Please contribute!</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>
<br/><br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal that we need to achieve in order to gain sufficient funds for stationery for all students in an underprivileged school in Sri Lanka will be $2000AUD.</p>
<p>I find tremendous happiness in bringing smiles to those who do not have the same lives as ours, and believe that you will find great happiness too in contributing to this worthwhile cause. </p>
<p>Even if the goal is not achieved, the funds still go towards the same cause, however, we will have to employ other fundraising methods to reach the target. Therefore, it would be an amazing help if as many people as possible contributed to this great cause.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Education is one of the most effective ways in reducing poverty and low income. If children are provided with a good education, they can become inspirational role models to the next generation, working in highly respected professions and roles, such as doctors, engineers, pilots, and world leaders. The increase of stable occupations will subsequent increase a country’s demand, hence increase the overall conditions of that country in relation to economic and social status. </p>
<p>I have completed other service community projects before, which has included volunteering, however, nothing to such a large-a-scale. I am a trustworthy and high-achieving student who aspires to help people in need.</p>
<p>If you would to know more about this initative, please don't hestiate to contact me at: punalakiripitige@yahoo.com.au</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the major issues concerning fundraising campaigns is often the issue of handling of funds and ensuring the authenticity of the campaign. However, what distinguishes our fundraising initiative from the rest is that I was born in Sri Lanka and my parents are both Sri Lankan, having lived extensively in these kind of villages, which means that we have direct connections to many of these poor areas in Sri Lanka. We have made friends with those who have very little, as well as those villages who are less fortunate.  We will be working with these village officials to ensure that funds are being used efficiently and properly. </p>
<p>After the goal of $2000AUD is raised, the funds will be collected in one bank account and transferred to an account in Sri Lanka, after which one of our family friends who is also a village official would provide the funds to a poor school in the area. The village official will ensure that stationery and exercise books are bought for all of the children in the school and none of the money is used for other purposes.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute directly, please share this fundraising campaign with your friends and social media such as facebook and twitter and help get others to donate for a good cause.</p>

As the Sri Lankan government provides textbooks for schooling, it is the children's responsibility to buy stationery for themselves. Many parents of these children are themselves finding life enduring many hardships and simply not earn enough money to even feed the family. Given that we are fortunate enough to live in a privileged country, with high quality education, I think it is absolutely vital that we help those who cannot afford to live their lives the same ways as us.
I would like us combined together to achieve a total of $2000AUD so that we can provide stationery for one whole year level to an underprivileged school in Sri Lanka.
If we could reach that goal it would help a lot of young people!
Please contribute!
Thank You!
What We Need & What You Get
The goal that we need to achieve in order to gain sufficient funds for stationery for all students in an underprivileged school in Sri Lanka will be $2000AUD.
I find tremendous happiness in bringing smiles to those who do not have the same lives as ours, and believe that you will find great happiness too in contributing to this worthwhile cause. 
Even if the goal is not achieved, the funds still go towards the same cause, however, we will have to employ other fundraising methods to reach the target. Therefore, it would be an amazing help if as many people as possible contributed to this great cause.
The Impact
Education is one of the most effective ways in reducing poverty and low income. If children are provided with a good education, they can become inspirational role models to the next generation, working in highly respected professions and roles, such as doctors, engineers, pilots, and world leaders. The increase of stable occupations will subsequent increase a country’s demand, hence increase the overall conditions of that country in relation to economic and social status. 
I have completed other service community projects before, which has included volunteering, however, nothing to such a large-a-scale. I am a trustworthy and high-achieving student who aspires to help people in need.

Risks & Challenges
One of the major issues concerning fundraising campaigns is often the issue of handling of funds and ensuring the authenticity of the campaign. However, what distinguishes our fundraising initiative from the rest is that I was born in Sri Lanka and my parents are both Sri Lankan, having lived extensively in these kind of villages, which means that we have direct connections to many of these poor areas in Sri Lanka. We have made friends with those who have very little, as well as those villages who are less fortunate.  We will be working with these village officials to ensure that funds are being used efficiently and properly. 
After the goal of $2000AUD is raised, the funds will be collected in one bank account and transferred to an account in Sri Lanka, after which one of our family friends who is also a village official would provide the funds to a poor school in the area. The village official will ensure that stationery and exercise books are bought for all of the children in the school and none of the money is used for other purposes.
Other Ways You Can Help

I'll show you how...</div><div>   <h3>How do we help students achieve their potential?</h3>It all starts with the metrics used to measure students' abilities and their progress through school.  Today's metrics, standardized tests and GPAs, have no correlation to a student's success in life, nor do they teach a student anything meaningful about who they really are.  I came across this problem many times when hiring and training sales people.  I noticed that those who succeeded were a <b>great fit both for the role and<i> </i>for the company</b> they worked for.  Those who failed were incredibly talented in other areas, but their strengths and passions were not applicable to the sales job we were hiring them for. </div><div>

</p>
<p>The solution starts with using the right metrics so we can really understand: 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>who each student is, </li>
<li>what work they would love, </li>
<li>
and the best way for them to get there.  <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Indigo Project <b>helps students know themselves so they can find the path to work they love.</b>  The same metrics I used to help companies find the right fit, I'm now using with students and educators as the Indigo Assessment, <i>creating powerful results</i> (<a href=""#already"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">more about that later</a>).  </p>
<p></p>The solution also entails <b>transparency in the educational system</b>.  <p></p>

Already making a difference
</h3>
<p>In 2013 I started a company to tackle this problem.  We developed the Indigo Report in partnership with TTI and it's already making a difference:  </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/760709/files/20140801222815-heather_joe.jpg?1406957295"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style=""""/>The University of Nebraska Environmental Studies program has completely transformed their program using our metrics and the results are outstanding: <b>100% of their students land jobs</b> after graduation. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> <br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>Eight students in a pilot program at Peak to Peak High School went from <b>30 failing grades to 3</b> in just ten weeks.  <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
Individual students receiving their Indigo Report have found <b>new hope and validation</b> when the school system has been telling them otherwise. Watch Haley's and Tom's stories below.  <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are already making an impact and will continue to do even more as our company grows.  <b>So why a crowdfunding campaign?</b>
</p>
<p>
One of the reasons why I'm doing an Indiegogo campaign is because I want to know how you feel about to this message.  <i>Do you believe in evolving education?  </i>You can start now, whether you are young or old.  It's never too late!  I want to give you the opportunity to support change, as well as to begin pursuing your own passions.

<p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/745464/files/20140726114918-report-page.gif?1406400558"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The Indigo Report combines 4 sciences that reveal your strengths, behaviors, motivators and skills.  Based on your unique combination, the report provides you with potential fields of study and career opportunities that you would thrive in.  <div>
<br/><p>To get a better idea of what you can do with this information, let me tell you what my report tells me... about me.  
<img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/734192/files/20140721182252-Sheri-DISC.gif?1405992172"" hspace=""5"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
I'm very high <b>D</b>ominance, high <b>I</b>nfluencing on the <b>DISC</b> behaviors graph.  High D's tend to be competitive, decisive, and determined. High I's tend to be enthusiastic, persuasive, and optimistic.  I sort-of knew these things about myself, but seeing it in the report and being able to compare my extreme scores to normative samples helped me understand where I will thrive, and what environments I should avoid in the workplace. 
<br/><br/><i>If I had known this at 18, I would have realized that the government career I was pursuing and majoring in was a terrible fit.</i><b>  </b>I need a fast paced, dynamic environment where I can be a results oriented leader and be free of repetitive and detailed work (low <b>C</b>ompliance).    
<br/><br/>
When you have your DISC scores, you can better choose your classes, field of study, and understand your strengths and weakness when working with other people.    
<p></p>
<b>So what motivates me? </b><div>

Your 26-page Indigo Report reveals this and much more, <b>including higher education options that match your passions.</b> Here are a few options that my report suggested for me.  I didn't even know what an entrepreneur was when I was in college - n<i>ow there are many opportunities for young entrepreneurs.</i>  <i><a href=""http://indigoproject.org/understand-report/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read more details on our website</a>.</i>

</div></div>","Hi, I'm Sheri Smith, CEO of the Indigo Project. The Indigo Project is a grassroots movement to empower students to find a path to work they will love.My vision is an educational system that helps students understand and achieve their true potential. We appreciate your support in joining the Indigo Project Movement and helping make this vision a reality.Today, students face many challenges in actualizing their potential:

The metrics used by the education system to measure students today have no correlation to life success.  
Schools don't teach students who they are or where their true genius lies.

What schools do teach doesn't prepare students for life in the 21st century.  

Furthermore, there is little transparency to the educational system - students don't know how likely they are to graduate, get a job, or how much it's really going to cost long-term.  
My goal is to change all of this and I would like your help. It's a big task, but there is a way to do it. I'll show you how...   How do we help students achieve their potential?It all starts with the metrics used to measure students' abilities and their progress through school.  Today's metrics, standardized tests and GPAs, have no correlation to a student's success in life, nor do they teach a student anything meaningful about who they really are.  I came across this problem many times when hiring and training sales people.  I noticed that those who succeeded were a great fit both for the role and for the company they worked for.  Those who failed were incredibly talented in other areas, but their strengths and passions were not applicable to the sales job we were hiring them for. 
We've all seen this - a great person in the wrong job.  As a child I remember my grandfather telling me why he retired early from engineering - he was promoted to a be a manager and he hated it.   His work became so unbearable that he quit.  He was an incredible engineer but a terrible manager.  Even then I felt sad for Gran-pa-pa and knew his company had lost a great asset by forcing him into the wrong role. So what's the solution?

The solution starts with using the right metrics so we can really understand: 




who each student is, 
what work they would love, 

and the best way for them to get there.  


The Indigo Project helps students know themselves so they can find the path to work they love.  The same metrics I used to help companies find the right fit, I'm now using with students and educators as the Indigo Assessment, creating powerful results (more about that later).  
The solution also entails transparency in the educational system.  



How likely are you to graduate from a particular university?  
If you do graduate, what jobs are you likely to get?  
If you land one of those jobs, are you going to like it?  
And will the cost of your education be a good investment?

The student resources we are building are designed to encourage transparency in the educational system by presenting the reality of college and career options. We are also highlighting alternative types of post secondary training and emerging fields for the Innovation Age.  



Sadly, the statistics today on higher education are abysmal. 
Today's young generation is projected to be the first in the history of America to be financially worse off than their parents.  
_________________
Having a college degree is increasingly important in the job market, yet only about half who begin a degree actually graduate.  
Of those who do graduate, half of those are unemployed or underemployed. And of the ones who do get jobs, the vast majority don't enjoy their work.
_________________
Moreover, the cost of education has increased 72% in a decade, while starting salaries have decreased by almost 15%.  

In short, many college graduates end up doing work they don't love and aren't prepared for, while incurring more debt to make less money. 

The situation is so challenging that 85% of graduates end up living at home with their parents after graduating.  

These statistics sum up why something needs to be done.  I would like you to help me do something about this problem!

Already making a difference

In 2013 I started a company to tackle this problem.  We developed the Indigo Report in partnership with TTI and it's already making a difference:  



The University of Nebraska Environmental Studies program has completely transformed their program using our metrics and the results are outstanding: 100% of their students land jobs after graduation.  

Eight students in a pilot program at Peak to Peak High School went from 30 failing grades to 3 in just ten weeks.  


Individual students receiving their Indigo Report have found new hope and validation when the school system has been telling them otherwise. Watch Haley's and Tom's stories below.  


We are already making an impact and will continue to do even more as our company grows.  So why a crowdfunding campaign?


One of the reasons why I'm doing an Indiegogo campaign is because I want to know how you feel about to this message.  Do you believe in evolving education?  You can start now, whether you are young or old.  It's never too late!  I want to give you the opportunity to support change, as well as to begin pursuing your own passions.

___________________________
Which gets to the perks I'm offering

For $10 you can say yes to this idea and let me know that you care about what I'm doing.


For $50 you can say yes to this idea, take the Indigo Report, and learn more about your own passions.  We will register you in our database and as we build our company and connect passions to career and educational choices, we will send you opportunities you'll be excited about.  When you buy a $50 perk, we also give a free Indigo Report to a student in need.  Read more about our 501c3 program. 

For $100 you can say yes to this idea, take the Indigo Report, and promote Indigo by wearing one of our beautiful T-shirts!  

For $500 you can help 20 people in need take the Indigo Assessment.  We are working with universities to help them be more inclusive in granting promising low-income students scholarships for college educations.  


For $1,000 you can help us make a job/education video. Check out our video on G-school.

For $10,000 you can help us make 10 job videos and your name will appear in the credits.  


For $25,000 you can become a sponsor of our mini documentary on just how bad the educational system is and what the solutions are.  You attend the premier night, have dinner with me and your name is in the credits.  


A note about why we selected $250,000 as our goal. Compared to the size of our mission, it's actually a very small amount.  Half of all money raised on Indiegogo will  automatically go toward helping students in need.  The other half will go toward creating online resources to support student learning.  We picked $250,000 because after giving half away we we need the additional capital to create our documentary, alternative education database, job videos, and online matching system.  The Indigo Project is an organic movement.  No matter what happens on Indiegogo, we will continue to build our company, help students find a path to work they love, and pursue our goal of evolving education.  This is our passion - we are committed to doing whatever it takes to see this vision through.

Does the Indigo Assessment really work?

I recently conducted a workshop at Peak to Peak High School with guidance counselor Kimberly Gannett that changed the lives of 8 ""at-risk"" students.

Carey McClure, professional college career counselor, emotionally talks about her daughter Haley's experience with the Indigo Report.

Watch Jane find a new perspective on her son with the Indigo Report.  Tom is another example of the educational system missing a student's tremendous potential.

How the Indigo Report is different than personality tests


The Indigo Report is not a ""touchy-feely"" personality test. It's backed by 30 years of research, and is used by numerous Fortune 500 companies to hire and develop employees in 90 countries.  It is the best non-cognitive tool on the market. The most frequent comment we get from people who take the Indigo Report is, ""This is the most meaningful assessment I've ever taken!"" 
Dr. Ron Bonnstetter, Director of R&D at TTI and a member of our Board of Directors discusses the validity of the Indigo.  You can watch his full story on our website.

What does the Indigo Report tell you... about you?


The Indigo Report combines 4 sciences that reveal your strengths, behaviors, motivators and skills.  Based on your unique combination, the report provides you with potential fields of study and career opportunities that you would thrive in.  
To get a better idea of what you can do with this information, let me tell you what my report tells me... about me.  


I'm very high Dominance, high Influencing on the DISC behaviors graph.  High D's tend to be competitive, decisive, and determined. High I's tend to be enthusiastic, persuasive, and optimistic.  I sort-of knew these things about myself, but seeing it in the report and being able to compare my extreme scores to normative samples helped me understand where I will thrive, and what environments I should avoid in the workplace. 
If I had known this at 18, I would have realized that the government career I was pursuing and majoring in was a terrible fit.  I need a fast paced, dynamic environment where I can be a results oriented leader and be free of repetitive and detailed work (low Compliance).    

When you have your DISC scores, you can better choose your classes, field of study, and understand your strengths and weakness when working with other people.    

So what motivates me? 
I'm a passionate Social, and slightly above average Utilitarian, so making money without making an impact on society will never satisfy me.  That's why I started a social enterprise, but always felt repelled by Wall Street. 
Motivators help you know ""why"" you do the things you do.  I tell students the best way to point yourself in a fulfilling direction is to look at your top two motivators.  For example, if your top motivator is Aesthetic, make sure your college environment provides a harmonious living environment.  Surroundings matter to high Aesthetics.  


Your 26-page Indigo Report reveals this and much more, including higher education options that match your passions. Here are a few options that my report suggested for me.  I didn't even know what an entrepreneur was when I was in college - now there are many opportunities for young entrepreneurs.  Read more details on our website.

Want to get your report now?  Click on the $50 perk and we will send you a link to take the Indigo within 48 hours.  It takes about 45 minutes and your report will automatically be emailed to you.

Our commitment to inclusion:
We created the Indigo Foundation (501c3 status pending)  as part of our company's commitment to inclusion.  The goal of the Indigo Foundation is to provide the Indigo Assessment free of cost to low income students.  Half the money we raise on Indiegogo will be automatically donated to a students in need.  We are already working with several organizations.  

Our first Boys and Girls Club Indigo workshop was held in July via our technology partner, TTI.  Here's what some of the participants had to say:




""I learned what my strengths are and to respect people's differences."" Chase

""I learned that the career I am going after matched my
personality type."" Vivian

""I learned that we need other people with different
personalities to create a great team."" Vanessa

""People should not try to
change others. They are who they are and don't need to change."" Harrison



Another of our partners is Project Voyce, a Denver non-profit seeking ""to empower youth to create positive change within themselves, their school, their community, and the world.""  Listen to the inspired students of Project Voyce share their dreams and perspectives on college and career choices:

Chief Sealth is a comprehensive high school that offers a wide array of opportunities for students who value learning in a dynamic, multi-cultural environment. It is an exceptional place that celebrates innovation and individuality. As a center of international educational excellence, we provide students opportunities to study the world both in the classroom and beyond.With the help of the Operation Wallacea Organization a group of students will have the chance to study ecology in the field for two weeks. The Honduras expedition is run in the endemic rich cloud forests of the Cusuco National Park or the lowland forests of the Jeanette Kawas National Park near Tela. The students spend their first week in a forest camp and will be on site with an international team of academics who are collecting data on the carbon, biodiversity and community benefits of the forest. These data are then being used as part of annual reports to help with funding the protection of the Cusuco Park under the Reduction in Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+ scheme) or if based in Tela on packaging the forests for funding under this scheme.

Chief Sealth is a school of very high needs.  Every dollar that you donate will help to open a world of opportunities for an amazing group of young people.
What We Need
 This expedition requires funds.  If our group goal of $22,000 is reached, 96% of your donation will go directly to helping fund student travel and OpWall expedition costs.  OpWall expeditions cost $1900 US/student + in-country transportation costs (~$200 US/student) Plane travel to Honduras ~$600 US roundtrip If we do not reach our total goal our students will be forced to pay for their trips themselves with funds they might otherwise be using to pay for their future education costs.
Any funds beyond the actual costs will be put towards some of the optional training and experiences available to students while they are on expedition (Tree canopy climbing, extra dive activities, etc)! Beyond that residual funds will be used to help make this a sustainable biannual program for students from Chief Sealth International. 



    The Impact Experiencing the world and people outside your own town/state/country can change a person's world view forever.  Contributing to worlds body of knowledge can change the way we interact with our planet.

<div><br/></div>
<div>Hwiemtun (Fred Roland)</div>
<div>Hwiemtun has worked with youth, culture and wilderness for over 20 years. ""My Traditional name is Hwiemtun (English name Fred Roland) and I was born and raised on Vancouver Island and have learned from many fo the elders of this territory. My mother is from the Cowichan territory and my (late) father’s lineage was Hawaiian. My years of learning from various tribes globally are now used for bridging between our traditional world and contemporary worlds'</div>
<div>Hwiemtun's Indigenous Education and Cultural Centre on his ancestral home by the Cowichan River is almost complete. We need to help him raise a final $10 000 to complete the main building. Most of the materials have been collected and a crew of professional carpenters and builders have offered their services. The $10 000 will be used to buy the materials needed to complete this project in time for the Indigenous Arts Festival in June 2015. $5 000 will be used to sponsor 3 Elders to attend the Festival from Central and South America.</div>
<div>Having this main building at the Education and Cultural Centre will allow Hwiemtun and the 'Wolf Cowichan' Program to have a venue to bring Indigenous Elders and youth together to learn and pass down knowledge and skills to the next generations.</div>
<div>It is important that the Elders can be hosted appropriately for these kind of programs to be provided.</div>
<div>In contributing to this campaign, you will be assisting a group of dedicated educators and community members who have already volunteered their time and resources to this project. Please help us get the job finished!</div> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The frame of the building is already up. </p>
<p>Much of the lumber has been collected.</p>
<p>$10 000 is needed to pay for roofing material, additional lumber and other building supplies.</p>
<p>All carpentry and building services are by volunteers.</p>
<p>3 Elders: Victor Choc, a Mayan Elder and educator from Toledo, Belize; Aurora Garcia Saqui, a Mayan herbalist and healer from the Maya Centre, Belize; and 'Roberto' a Quechua educator from the Amazon Region of Ecuador will each receive $1200 to attend the Festival.</p>
<p>$1400 will be used for promotional material for the Festival.</p>
<p>All contributions over $15 will receive 50% off admission to the Festival. </p>
<p>All contributions over $50 will receive a deer hide medicine pouch made by our students.</p>
<p>All contributions over $100 will receive our special herbal and smudging medicine mix with ingredients from North, South and Central America.</p>
<p>All contributions over $1000 will receive a hand-made, hand-painted drum.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Indigenous Elders and the knowledge they carry are at risk of being lost. The Indigenous Education and Cultural Centre and the Indigenous Arts Festival have already touched hundreds of students with teachings, skills and ceremony. The building resource will allow us to reach more students and host the Elders in a comfortable and appropriate manner.</p>

Hwiemtun (Fred Roland)
Hwiemtun has worked with youth, culture and wilderness for over 20 years. ""My Traditional name is Hwiemtun (English name Fred Roland) and I was born and raised on Vancouver Island and have learned from many fo the elders of this territory. My mother is from the Cowichan territory and my (late) father’s lineage was Hawaiian. My years of learning from various tribes globally are now used for bridging between our traditional world and contemporary worlds'
Hwiemtun's Indigenous Education and Cultural Centre on his ancestral home by the Cowichan River is almost complete. We need to help him raise a final $10 000 to complete the main building. Most of the materials have been collected and a crew of professional carpenters and builders have offered their services. The $10 000 will be used to buy the materials needed to complete this project in time for the Indigenous Arts Festival in June 2015. $5 000 will be used to sponsor 3 Elders to attend the Festival from Central and South America.
Having this main building at the Education and Cultural Centre will allow Hwiemtun and the 'Wolf Cowichan' Program to have a venue to bring Indigenous Elders and youth together to learn and pass down knowledge and skills to the next generations.
It is important that the Elders can be hosted appropriately for these kind of programs to be provided.
In contributing to this campaign, you will be assisting a group of dedicated educators and community members who have already volunteered their time and resources to this project. Please help us get the job finished!    What We Need & What You Get The frame of the building is already up. 
Much of the lumber has been collected.
$10 000 is needed to pay for roofing material, additional lumber and other building supplies.
All carpentry and building services are by volunteers.
3 Elders: Victor Choc, a Mayan Elder and educator from Toledo, Belize; Aurora Garcia Saqui, a Mayan herbalist and healer from the Maya Centre, Belize; and 'Roberto' a Quechua educator from the Amazon Region of Ecuador will each receive $1200 to attend the Festival.
$1400 will be used for promotional material for the Festival.
All contributions over $15 will receive 50% off admission to the Festival. 
All contributions over $50 will receive a deer hide medicine pouch made by our students.
All contributions over $100 will receive our special herbal and smudging medicine mix with ingredients from North, South and Central America.
All contributions over $1000 will receive a hand-made, hand-painted drum.   The Impact Indigenous Elders and the knowledge they carry are at risk of being lost. The Indigenous Education and Cultural Centre and the Indigenous Arts Festival have already touched hundreds of students with teachings, skills and ceremony. The building resource will allow us to reach more students and host the Elders in a comfortable and appropriate manner.

school’s journey began five years ago when founders Julie Speier and John
Crilly first moved from New York City to San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua. A
seasoned educator, Julie recognized the need for a high quality school,
with low student-teacher ratios, a sustainable curriculum, English language
learning, and highly qualified educators trained to work with a diverse student
body.  The school opened its doors in 2009 with just 1 teacher and 6 students and a half day program.  Five years later, the school has expanded exponentially into a high quality primary school educating a diverse Nicaraguan and Expat student body of children from the ages of 18 months to eight year.  Now, with 54 students, 1 director, 4 lead teachers, a Spanish teacher, ESL instruction, and 2 teaching assistants, we are outgrowing our current location!</p><p>Thanks to a very generous land donation from <a href=""http://fincalasnubes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Finca las Nubes</a>, San Juan del Sur Day School now has the space upon which to build a beautiful campus - one that will grow with our students, ultimately servicing children in pre-kindergarten thru the 12th grade.  However, we need your help!</p><p>Our goal is to raise $150,000 over the next few months for the
construction and materials of Phase 1 of the new campus which includes a 5-classroom primary school building, furniture, parking lot, and playground.  <b> <i>All donations will
go directly to costs associated with the construction of the building,
materials and labor.  The school's expenses (salaries, maintenance, school
supplies, food, taxes, etc.) will continue to be covered by tuition
payments.</i></b></p><p>
</p><p><b>PLANS FOR PHASE ONE</b></p>

<p><b>CONSTRUCTION</b></p>
<p>The talented,
experienced building team at Finca las Nubes, a leader in sustainable
construction, intentional building, and environmental preservation, will manage
construction of the school. </p>
<p>Our urgency to begin
construction is based on our rapid growth over the last few years.  We are quickly outgrowing our current
space and our lease expires at the end of the year.  Instead of finding a
new rental space that will require a significant investment to make it school-ready,
we have decided to invest in the school’s future, putting our money into bricks
and mortar of our own.  This has suddenly become a reality with the
extremely generous land donation of 30 pristine acres, given to the school by
Finca Las Nubes.  </p>
<p>""<a href=""http://fincalasnubes.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Finca Las Nubes</i></a>,
[located approximately 2 miles from town]<i> is first and foremost dedicated to
preserving the environment and helping others do the same. We support the
development of sustainable farming techniques and the promotion
thereof. Most of us have satisfied our own needs and are bent on giving
back. Finca Las Nubes is designed to provide a base of operations for these
projects.</i>"" </p>
<p>This amazing land
donation, with mountain, ocean and lake views will provide our students with
the ideal learning environment, featuring natural landscapes, organic gardens,
wood working shop, beautiful walking trails, playing fields and opportunities
to work with and help care for the farm and its animals.  Finca Las Nubes
uses sustainable living practices in all that it does and this important part
of our mission is well matched.  Locating our school on this stunning
property will allow us to attain our goal of becoming a full Pre-K through 12th
grade International English school.</p>

<p><b>VISION FOR THE FUTURE</b></p>
<p>Our vision for San
Juan del Sur Day School does not end with a primary school.  We intend to launch the second phase of
construction, which will include an extension to the primary school building, a
middle school (grades 6-8), playing fields, a competition size swimming pool
and administrative offices in 2017. 
By 2020, we plan to add a high school for students in grades 9-12.</p>
<p>In addition to
continued fundraising, the objective for the school is to eventually fund
future construction and improvements from, not only donations, but also income
generated by tuition.  As the
school’s enrollment increases, so too will our income for future projects.  Our plan is to expand organically,
based on the needs of our growing student body.  We will continue to grow with our oldest students and assign
teachers and classrooms as enrollment demands.  Our goal is to maintain a student-teacher ratio of 12:1 for
our youngest students and to meet international standards of 24:1 in the older
classrooms.</p>
<p>In February 2009 the school
opened with six students.  As of
January 2014, we have 54 students enrolled, with 8 new students set to enroll
by September 2014.  Eight of our
students have been enrolled with the school since 2009, and as our school ages,
we delight in seeing not only siblings enroll, but the newest members of our
community. Using historical data of the school over the last 5 years, we
project enrollment to increase to 100 students within the next three years.
Moving the school to Finca Las Nubes, and attaining local accreditation within
the year will open our doors to a whole new demographic of students from Rivas
and the neighboring areas. We predict a continuous and sustainable net profit
over the next 5 years of 18% on earnings, which shall be retained by the school
for future development. The business is solvent, healthy and growing in the
right direction.  For a more
detailed financial breakdown of the business, and projections, please contact

<p><b>WHY SAN JUAN DEL SUR
DAY SCHOOL?</b></p>
<p>San Juan del Sur Day
School has provided quality English education to children of San Juan ages 18
months to 8 years for the past five years. Our mission is to create a community
of life long learners and responsible global citizens comprised of both
Nicaraguan and International families. 
Our goal is to grow with our oldest students through high school by
providing them with a safe, creative, sustainable campus that prepares them to
go on to higher education, enter the workforce, and give back to the
community.  Without our school,
many of our talented students may not have the resources and opportunities to
earn the necessary education to become international learners.</p>
<p><b>English Education</b><b></b></p>
<p>San Juan del Sur Day
School benefits, not only the community of San Juan del Sur by keeping and
attracting resourceful, global citizens with entrepreneurial spirits, but it
also educates local children so that they can be more productive members of
society, using their education and critical thinking skills to help create
jobs, take care of their families and our resources.  San Juan del Sur Day School currently provides scholarships
or financial aid to approximately 16% of our students with the goal of sustaining
25% of our total student body with educational assistance in the near future.
Funding for these scholarships is generated via school tuition and individual
sponsors.  While tuition is covered
for these deserving students, they still require a proper campus to grow,
develop and explore the world around them. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>""<i>An
extra year of good schooling lifts a country’s yearly economic growth by 1%,
making poor countries richer and, in the long run, less in need of foreign aid
– and more able to trade.</i>”<span><a href=""#_edn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[i]</a></span></p>
<p><b>International
Community </b><b></b></p>
<p>Of the 54 students
currently enrolled in the school, approximately one quarter are local
Nicaraguans, one quarter are ""expats"" and the other half have one
Nicaraguan and one expat parent (hailing from Canada, U.S., Russia,
Ukraine, Germany, Costa Rica, Holland, Switzerland, Spain, Cuba and
Ireland).</p>
<p>An international
education offers the opportunity to celebrate diversity in a spirit of
understanding and tolerance and to develop a positive regard and awareness of
other people. This is an education that goes far beyond the confines of the
classroom and sees in the learning process the chance for some remarkable
lessons. An appreciation of different cultures and backgrounds creates a sense
of openness and understanding that enables students to work well with others
and for many, to lead people with different viewpoints in a cohesive team.  A key factor for success in adulthood
is a child’s ability to communicate with people from different backgrounds. We
see an opportunity to develop cross-cultural understanding, an international
outlook and an ability to build quality relationships with people from
different backgrounds.</p>
<p>""The nature of
the problems the world needs to solve today cannot be solved at the level at
which they were created. We need to see beyond the fragmented differences of
culture, language and religion to a more fundamental reality. One of the great
advantages of an international education is that you can create an environment
in which young people from different cultures, nationalities and languages are
brought together in one place. They have the opportunity to learn that what
makes them human is not their cultural identity, language, or religion alone
but it is also something essentially spiritual that transcends all of these
things. In other words, they have the chance to recognise that there is a
common humanity which transcends the differences at which world problems are
often experienced today.""</p>

</p>
<p><b>Portable Education</b><b></b></p>
<p>The appeal of San
Juan del Sur Day School is great for many of our multi-cultural families. Our
curriculum, based significantly on the International Baccalaureate (IB), but
also incorporating standards outlined by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Education,
provides students with a high quality <b><i>portable</i></b> <b><i>education</i></b>
that will stand them in good stead whether they move on to a new country or
remain in Nicaragua. By following the model of the IB schools<a href=""#_edn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[iii]</span></a> and completing the rigorous process to
obtain International English School Accreditation(NEASC) via: <a href=""http://caisa.neasc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The
New England Association of Schools and Colleges</a> our students will be well prepared to thrive
in any educational setting.</p>
<p>The NEASC
accreditation is a system of accountability that is ongoing, voluntary, and
comprehensive in scope. It respects differences in institutional populations,
missions, and cultures, and fosters institutional change grounded in the
judgment of practicing educators. It is based on standards which are developed
and regularly reviewed by the members and which define the characteristics of
good schools and colleges.<a href=""#_edn2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[iv]</span></a></p>
<p>Almost half of our students
come from blended Nicaraguan/Expatriate families.  These families seek an education for their children <span>that will soon be accredited in both Nicaragua and
internationally, giving their children the opportunity to seamlessly continue
their education in either of their home countries. Furthermore, by sending
their children to SJdS Day School, our parents are reinforcing their children's
exposure to the two languages and cultures taught at home: English, the primary
language of instruction, as well as Spanish via other students, teaching
assistants, and formal lessons. </span></p>
<p>Each student, each
family has their own story.  Yet
the common thread for all is the desire to learn.  Help us to continue their story by donating to the building
fund.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>WHY NICARAGUA?</b></p>
<p>Expatriate retirees
have been flocking to Nicaragua for years, but anecdotal evidence suggests a
spike in relocation of families with young children, as well.  The rapid increase in enrollment and request
for information at San Juan del Sur Day School over the last three years
positively correlates with these findings.  In place of vacations, foreigners are setting up long
term residences in Nicaragua thanks to a more affordable, simpler way of life
that allows for more family time in a beautiful, tropical climate.  They are driven by entrepreneurial
opportunities, affordable real estate, low crime rates, and reasonable health
care.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Stable
Investment Opportunities</b><b></b></p>
<p>Although
one of the poorest nations in the region, Nicaragua’s economy is showing rapid
growth.  In 2012, Nicaragua set a new personal best for
foreign-direct investment (FDI), netting $1.28 billion—a remarkable 33%
increase from the year before, according to investment-promotion agency ProNicaragua.
The level of investment growth is even more impressive considering it comes on
top of a monstrous 91% jump in foreign-direct investment in 2011. In real
terms, foreign investment levels have more than doubled over the past two
years.  “The historic level of
growth reached in 2012 demonstrates the commitment of the Government of
Reconciliation and National Unity to continue improving the investment climate,
facilitate investment processes, and promote socio-economic development in the
country,” said Gen. Alvaro Baltodano, presidential delegate for foreign investment.<a href=""#_edn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[v]</span></a> <span>The 2013
Doing Business Report, recently published by the World Bank, revealed that
Nicaragua improved a position in its overall ranking with positive developments
in the Trading Across Borders, and Resolving Insolvency categories. This is the
third consecutive year the country has improved its position within the report,
which demonstrates a positive impact of the various efforts carried out to
improve the country’s investment climate.</span><a href=""#_edn2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[vi]</span></a></p>
<p><b>Safety</b><b></b></p>
<p>Nicaragua
significantly improved its position in the western hemisphere in the 2013
Global Peace Index (GPI).  Other
prestigious institutions have recognized Nicaragua not only as one of the
safest destinations in the region, but also as a country with an excellent
business climate.<a href=""#_edn3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[vii]</span></a>  The Inter-American Institute on human rights identified Nicaragua
as the safest country in Central America.  A United Nations report also revealed that the crime rate was
lower than the U.S., France and Germany.<a href=""#_edn4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[viii]</span></a> 
In 2012, The Economist named Nicaragua “A Surprising Safe Haven,” l<span>ess violent than booming Panama, and soon safer than
Costa Rica, a tourist haven.</span><a href=""#_edn5"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[ix]</span></a></p>
<p><b>Popularity</b><b></b></p>
<p>Just
two months into 2014 and Nicaragua has appeared in over 5 articles touting its
appeal to tourists, foreign investors, expatriates and retirees.  The country has been featured numerous
times by the Huffington Post and was named one of the “best value travel
destinations for 2014” by Lonely Planet<a href=""#_edn6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[x]</span></a> and a “Top 10
Destination to Watch in 2014” by Condé Nast<a href=""#_edn7"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[xi]</span></a>.  In 2013, both the Wall Street Journal,
as well as the Christian Science Monitor suggested Nicaragua as a popular
retirement location.  Nicaragua was
also featured in two seasons of the popular CBS television series, <i>Survivor</i>.  The outpouring of positive press
coverage for the country in recent years has helped to shift perceptions of a
once misunderstood country, paving the way for increased investment and
stability.  To follow Nicaragua’s

<p><b>WHO WE ARE</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Julie Speier:
Co-Founder, Director, and Head Teacher</b></p>
<p>Before moving to San
Juan del Sur, Julie was the program coordinator of the toddler program at <a href=""https://www.countryday.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cincinnati
Country Day School</a>
where she worked closely with parents and oversaw 3 head teachers, 3 assistant
teachers and 36 students. She also taught Pre-K, Kindergarten and first grade
while there. During her time at CCDS she was mentored in and used the
Constructivist approach to education. She also worked with colleagues to
develop and implement a curriculum that is still in use there today.</p>
<p>While at CCDS, Julie
also coached the middle school Cross Country and Swim teams. She served on
numerous committees including SEED (Seeking Equality through Educational
Diversity), Search for the New Head of School, ISACS (Independent Schools
Association of the Central States) and Growth and Development. She worked
closely with the Head of School and the Lower School principals allowing her
the opportunity to observe and learn from these gifted leaders.</p>
<p>Prior to her work
with CCDS, she lived in Hawaii where she taught second grade ESL at Kalihi Kai
Elementary School and developed a love and passion for the ocean and surfing.
 At Boston University she earned her degree in Early Childhood Education
as the recipient of a full swimming scholarship.  In addition to her
passion for teaching, and love of surfing, Julie is also a certified yoga
teacher. Julie has two young daughters and one on the way with her partner John
Crilly.</p>
<p><b>John Crilly: Co-Founder
and Director of Operations</b></p>
<p>After studying
Construction and Civil Engineering in Ireland for 2 years, John relocated to
New York where he worked in the Restaurant and Hospitality business for 20
years.  During that time, he
designed, operated and owned his own establishments while simultaneously
studying Building Management and Finance and real estate appraisal at New York
University’s Graduate School.  In
2008, John and his family relocated to San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua and opened
the doors to San Juan del Sur Day School in 2009.  In his role as Director of Operations, John oversees the
school’s accounting and purchasing, and will supervise the construction of the
new school.</p>
<p><b>PARTNERSHIPS  </b></p>
<p>San Juan del Sur Day
School has formed a partnership with <a href=""http://www.comunidadconnect.org/%5F"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Comunidad
Connect</a>, a U.S. <span>501(c)(3) non-profit organization working to improve the
quality of life of people in Nicaragua by matching local and global resources
with opportunities for sustainable development.  An ear to the ground and a strong connection to the
community, Comunidad Connect recommends local children, showing academic
promise and a strong support network, for San Juan del Sur Day School’s
scholarship program.  In addition
to scholarship recommendations, Comunidad Connect also assists San Juan del Sur
Day School in the planning and implementation of meaningful community-based
field trips.  Such field trips
include monthly visits to the community of Astillero and the project “One Less
Bag, One More Turtle,” where students learn about the importance of recycling
and protecting our environment and also to the women’s jam collective in El
Carizal where students are introduced to local, sustainable business practices.
 It is with a partnership like this between our school and
Comunidad Connect that we will be able to fulfill our mission and grow in a
sustainable and responsible way.  </span></p>
<p>High quality
education can help to transform children, who in turn transform our
communities, cities, countries and the world for the benefit of us all. Quality
education helps to create citizens who understand politics and can make
beneficial changes to governmental systems, people who work together to
create strong, open institutions, and societies. We thank you in advance for
donating what you can to our construction fund, so that we can continue to
further the opportunities available to our students, community, country and
world.  The completion of this
exciting project will provide a space for higher learning for generations to
come.  We are grateful for this
opportunity and we look forward to your support.</p>

school’s journey began five years ago when founders Julie Speier and John
Crilly first moved from New York City to San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua. A
seasoned educator, Julie recognized the need for a high quality school,
with low student-teacher ratios, a sustainable curriculum, English language
learning, and highly qualified educators trained to work with a diverse student
body.  The school opened its doors in 2009 with just 1 teacher and 6 students and a half day program.  Five years later, the school has expanded exponentially into a high quality primary school educating a diverse Nicaraguan and Expat student body of children from the ages of 18 months to eight year.  Now, with 54 students, 1 director, 4 lead teachers, a Spanish teacher, ESL instruction, and 2 teaching assistants, we are outgrowing our current location!Thanks to a very generous land donation from Finca las Nubes, San Juan del Sur Day School now has the space upon which to build a beautiful campus - one that will grow with our students, ultimately servicing children in pre-kindergarten thru the 12th grade.  However, we need your help!Our goal is to raise $150,000 over the next few months for the
construction and materials of Phase 1 of the new campus which includes a 5-classroom primary school building, furniture, parking lot, and playground.   All donations will
go directly to costs associated with the construction of the building,
materials and labor.  The school's expenses (salaries, maintenance, school
supplies, food, taxes, etc.) will continue to be covered by tuition
payments.
PLANS FOR PHASE ONE
Primary School building:
One 6x6 meter flexible classroom with
divider for out Toddler program/Pre-K-1: for students
ages 18 months – 3 years
Three 4x6 meter classrooms (Pre-K2: ages 3-5; Kindergarten/1st grade room:
ages 5-7; 2nd-4th Grade
Multiage room: ages 7-9)
Toddler bathroom, children's bathroom,
faculty bathroom
Small office/faculty room
Kitchen

One
Large 8x6 meter dining hall/common area
Furniture
Playground
Parking lot


CONSTRUCTION
The talented,
experienced building team at Finca las Nubes, a leader in sustainable
construction, intentional building, and environmental preservation, will manage
construction of the school. 
Our urgency to begin
construction is based on our rapid growth over the last few years.  We are quickly outgrowing our current
space and our lease expires at the end of the year.  Instead of finding a
new rental space that will require a significant investment to make it school-ready,
we have decided to invest in the school’s future, putting our money into bricks
and mortar of our own.  This has suddenly become a reality with the
extremely generous land donation of 30 pristine acres, given to the school by
Finca Las Nubes.  
""Finca Las Nubes,
[located approximately 2 miles from town] is first and foremost dedicated to
preserving the environment and helping others do the same. We support the
development of sustainable farming techniques and the promotion
thereof. Most of us have satisfied our own needs and are bent on giving
back. Finca Las Nubes is designed to provide a base of operations for these
projects."" 
This amazing land
donation, with mountain, ocean and lake views will provide our students with
the ideal learning environment, featuring natural landscapes, organic gardens,
wood working shop, beautiful walking trails, playing fields and opportunities
to work with and help care for the farm and its animals.  Finca Las Nubes
uses sustainable living practices in all that it does and this important part
of our mission is well matched.  Locating our school on this stunning
property will allow us to attain our goal of becoming a full Pre-K through 12th
grade International English school.

DONATIONS
San Juan del Sur Day
School is raising funds for the first phase of construction through various
channels including friends, families, fundraising events, crowdfunding websites
(see below), corporations and those with a personal interest in the development
of the school and the community. 
To kick-start our
building campaign, the great grandfather of one of our students has generously
offered to match the first $20,000 in donations. Please help us take advantage
of this offer, your donation gets doubled and we can receive this extra
$20,000.
In recognition of
donations of $30,000 or more, a donor may choose to dedicate/name one of the 4
classrooms or the dining hall of the new campus.
San Juan del Sur Day School
currently operates as a small private registered business in Nicaragua.  
Donations can be made
via one of four avenues:
·  Donations can be made directly to our construction
and materials accounts here in Nicaragua at LaFise and at Wells Fargo in the US
overseen by San Juan del Sur Day School. 
Please contact john@sanjuandelsurdayschool.com for account information.
· 
For
tax deductible donations of $100 or more: Comunidad Connect, a 501 (c) (3) U.S.
non-profit organization working in Nicaragua to promote sustainable community
development, cultural integrity, and civic engagement will accept donations on
our behalf and transfer monies directly to the construction project.  CC charges a 5% administrative fee,
which helps to support all of the beneficial projects in which CC is involved. 
· 
For
Credit Card donations, please feel free to donate directly from this page.  You can find a ""contribute now"" button at both the top and bottom of this page.  Indiegogo retains 4% of monies received through
their site if we reach our initial goal of $10,000 or 9% if we do not reach our goal.
· 
Any
amount of cash donations can be made directly at the school.
VISION FOR THE FUTURE
Our vision for San
Juan del Sur Day School does not end with a primary school.  We intend to launch the second phase of
construction, which will include an extension to the primary school building, a
middle school (grades 6-8), playing fields, a competition size swimming pool
and administrative offices in 2017. 
By 2020, we plan to add a high school for students in grades 9-12.
In addition to
continued fundraising, the objective for the school is to eventually fund
future construction and improvements from, not only donations, but also income
generated by tuition.  As the
school’s enrollment increases, so too will our income for future projects.  Our plan is to expand organically,
based on the needs of our growing student body.  We will continue to grow with our oldest students and assign
teachers and classrooms as enrollment demands.  Our goal is to maintain a student-teacher ratio of 12:1 for
our youngest students and to meet international standards of 24:1 in the older
classrooms.
In February 2009 the school
opened with six students.  As of
January 2014, we have 54 students enrolled, with 8 new students set to enroll
by September 2014.  Eight of our
students have been enrolled with the school since 2009, and as our school ages,
we delight in seeing not only siblings enroll, but the newest members of our
community. Using historical data of the school over the last 5 years, we
project enrollment to increase to 100 students within the next three years.
Moving the school to Finca Las Nubes, and attaining local accreditation within
the year will open our doors to a whole new demographic of students from Rivas
and the neighboring areas. We predict a continuous and sustainable net profit
over the next 5 years of 18% on earnings, which shall be retained by the school
for future development. The business is solvent, healthy and growing in the
right direction.  For a more
detailed financial breakdown of the business, and projections, please contact
our Director of Operations: john@sanjuandelsurdayschool.com
WHY SAN JUAN DEL SUR
DAY SCHOOL?
San Juan del Sur Day
School has provided quality English education to children of San Juan ages 18
months to 8 years for the past five years. Our mission is to create a community
of life long learners and responsible global citizens comprised of both
Nicaraguan and International families. 
Our goal is to grow with our oldest students through high school by
providing them with a safe, creative, sustainable campus that prepares them to
go on to higher education, enter the workforce, and give back to the
community.  Without our school,
many of our talented students may not have the resources and opportunities to
earn the necessary education to become international learners.
English Education
San Juan del Sur Day
School benefits, not only the community of San Juan del Sur by keeping and
attracting resourceful, global citizens with entrepreneurial spirits, but it
also educates local children so that they can be more productive members of
society, using their education and critical thinking skills to help create
jobs, take care of their families and our resources.  San Juan del Sur Day School currently provides scholarships
or financial aid to approximately 16% of our students with the goal of sustaining
25% of our total student body with educational assistance in the near future.
Funding for these scholarships is generated via school tuition and individual
sponsors.  While tuition is covered
for these deserving students, they still require a proper campus to grow,
develop and explore the world around them. 


""An
extra year of good schooling lifts a country’s yearly economic growth by 1%,
making poor countries richer and, in the long run, less in need of foreign aid
– and more able to trade.”[i]
International
Community 
Of the 54 students
currently enrolled in the school, approximately one quarter are local
Nicaraguans, one quarter are ""expats"" and the other half have one
Nicaraguan and one expat parent (hailing from Canada, U.S., Russia,
Ukraine, Germany, Costa Rica, Holland, Switzerland, Spain, Cuba and
Ireland).
An international
education offers the opportunity to celebrate diversity in a spirit of
understanding and tolerance and to develop a positive regard and awareness of
other people. This is an education that goes far beyond the confines of the
classroom and sees in the learning process the chance for some remarkable
lessons. An appreciation of different cultures and backgrounds creates a sense
of openness and understanding that enables students to work well with others
and for many, to lead people with different viewpoints in a cohesive team.  A key factor for success in adulthood
is a child’s ability to communicate with people from different backgrounds. We
see an opportunity to develop cross-cultural understanding, an international
outlook and an ability to build quality relationships with people from
different backgrounds.
""The nature of
the problems the world needs to solve today cannot be solved at the level at
which they were created. We need to see beyond the fragmented differences of
culture, language and religion to a more fundamental reality. One of the great
advantages of an international education is that you can create an environment
in which young people from different cultures, nationalities and languages are
brought together in one place. They have the opportunity to learn that what
makes them human is not their cultural identity, language, or religion alone
but it is also something essentially spiritual that transcends all of these
things. In other words, they have the chance to recognise that there is a
common humanity which transcends the differences at which world problems are
often experienced today.""
~ Dr. Jonathan Long,
Headmaster of the Round Square school in Britain[ii]



Portable Education
The appeal of San
Juan del Sur Day School is great for many of our multi-cultural families. Our
curriculum, based significantly on the International Baccalaureate (IB), but
also incorporating standards outlined by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Education,
provides students with a high quality portable education
that will stand them in good stead whether they move on to a new country or
remain in Nicaragua. By following the model of the IB schools[iii] and completing the rigorous process to
obtain International English School Accreditation(NEASC) via: The
New England Association of Schools and Colleges our students will be well prepared to thrive
in any educational setting.
The NEASC
accreditation is a system of accountability that is ongoing, voluntary, and
comprehensive in scope. It respects differences in institutional populations,
missions, and cultures, and fosters institutional change grounded in the
judgment of practicing educators. It is based on standards which are developed
and regularly reviewed by the members and which define the characteristics of
good schools and colleges.[iv]
Almost half of our students
come from blended Nicaraguan/Expatriate families.  These families seek an education for their children that will soon be accredited in both Nicaragua and
internationally, giving their children the opportunity to seamlessly continue
their education in either of their home countries. Furthermore, by sending
their children to SJdS Day School, our parents are reinforcing their children's
exposure to the two languages and cultures taught at home: English, the primary
language of instruction, as well as Spanish via other students, teaching
assistants, and formal lessons. 
Each student, each
family has their own story.  Yet
the common thread for all is the desire to learn.  Help us to continue their story by donating to the building
fund.


WHY NICARAGUA?
Expatriate retirees
have been flocking to Nicaragua for years, but anecdotal evidence suggests a
spike in relocation of families with young children, as well.  The rapid increase in enrollment and request
for information at San Juan del Sur Day School over the last three years
positively correlates with these findings.  In place of vacations, foreigners are setting up long
term residences in Nicaragua thanks to a more affordable, simpler way of life
that allows for more family time in a beautiful, tropical climate.  They are driven by entrepreneurial
opportunities, affordable real estate, low crime rates, and reasonable health
care.

Stable
Investment Opportunities
Although
one of the poorest nations in the region, Nicaragua’s economy is showing rapid
growth.  In 2012, Nicaragua set a new personal best for
foreign-direct investment (FDI), netting $1.28 billion—a remarkable 33%
increase from the year before, according to investment-promotion agency ProNicaragua.
The level of investment growth is even more impressive considering it comes on
top of a monstrous 91% jump in foreign-direct investment in 2011. In real
terms, foreign investment levels have more than doubled over the past two
years.  “The historic level of
growth reached in 2012 demonstrates the commitment of the Government of
Reconciliation and National Unity to continue improving the investment climate,
facilitate investment processes, and promote socio-economic development in the
country,” said Gen. Alvaro Baltodano, presidential delegate for foreign investment.[v] The 2013
Doing Business Report, recently published by the World Bank, revealed that
Nicaragua improved a position in its overall ranking with positive developments
in the Trading Across Borders, and Resolving Insolvency categories. This is the
third consecutive year the country has improved its position within the report,
which demonstrates a positive impact of the various efforts carried out to
improve the country’s investment climate.[vi]
Safety
Nicaragua
significantly improved its position in the western hemisphere in the 2013
Global Peace Index (GPI).  Other
prestigious institutions have recognized Nicaragua not only as one of the
safest destinations in the region, but also as a country with an excellent
business climate.[vii]  The Inter-American Institute on human rights identified Nicaragua
as the safest country in Central America.  A United Nations report also revealed that the crime rate was
lower than the U.S., France and Germany.[viii] 
In 2012, The Economist named Nicaragua “A Surprising Safe Haven,” less violent than booming Panama, and soon safer than
Costa Rica, a tourist haven.[ix]
Popularity
Just
two months into 2014 and Nicaragua has appeared in over 5 articles touting its
appeal to tourists, foreign investors, expatriates and retirees.  The country has been featured numerous
times by the Huffington Post and was named one of the “best value travel
destinations for 2014” by Lonely Planet[x] and a “Top 10
Destination to Watch in 2014” by Condé Nast[xi].  In 2013, both the Wall Street Journal,
as well as the Christian Science Monitor suggested Nicaragua as a popular
retirement location.  Nicaragua was
also featured in two seasons of the popular CBS television series, Survivor.  The outpouring of positive press
coverage for the country in recent years has helped to shift perceptions of a
once misunderstood country, paving the way for increased investment and
stability.  To follow Nicaragua’s
press coverage, you can visit Nicaragua’s
tourism board (INTUR).[xii]


WHO WE ARE

Julie Speier:
Co-Founder, Director, and Head Teacher
Before moving to San
Juan del Sur, Julie was the program coordinator of the toddler program at Cincinnati
Country Day School
where she worked closely with parents and oversaw 3 head teachers, 3 assistant
teachers and 36 students. She also taught Pre-K, Kindergarten and first grade
while there. During her time at CCDS she was mentored in and used the
Constructivist approach to education. She also worked with colleagues to
develop and implement a curriculum that is still in use there today.
While at CCDS, Julie
also coached the middle school Cross Country and Swim teams. She served on
numerous committees including SEED (Seeking Equality through Educational
Diversity), Search for the New Head of School, ISACS (Independent Schools
Association of the Central States) and Growth and Development. She worked
closely with the Head of School and the Lower School principals allowing her
the opportunity to observe and learn from these gifted leaders.
Prior to her work
with CCDS, she lived in Hawaii where she taught second grade ESL at Kalihi Kai
Elementary School and developed a love and passion for the ocean and surfing.
 At Boston University she earned her degree in Early Childhood Education
as the recipient of a full swimming scholarship.  In addition to her
passion for teaching, and love of surfing, Julie is also a certified yoga
teacher. Julie has two young daughters and one on the way with her partner John
Crilly.
John Crilly: Co-Founder
and Director of Operations
After studying
Construction and Civil Engineering in Ireland for 2 years, John relocated to
New York where he worked in the Restaurant and Hospitality business for 20
years.  During that time, he
designed, operated and owned his own establishments while simultaneously
studying Building Management and Finance and real estate appraisal at New York
University’s Graduate School.  In
2008, John and his family relocated to San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua and opened
the doors to San Juan del Sur Day School in 2009.  In his role as Director of Operations, John oversees the
school’s accounting and purchasing, and will supervise the construction of the
new school.
PARTNERSHIPS  
San Juan del Sur Day
School has formed a partnership with Comunidad
Connect, a U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit organization working to improve the
quality of life of people in Nicaragua by matching local and global resources
with opportunities for sustainable development.  An ear to the ground and a strong connection to the
community, Comunidad Connect recommends local children, showing academic
promise and a strong support network, for San Juan del Sur Day School’s
scholarship program.  In addition
to scholarship recommendations, Comunidad Connect also assists San Juan del Sur
Day School in the planning and implementation of meaningful community-based
field trips.  Such field trips
include monthly visits to the community of Astillero and the project “One Less
Bag, One More Turtle,” where students learn about the importance of recycling
and protecting our environment and also to the women’s jam collective in El
Carizal where students are introduced to local, sustainable business practices.
 It is with a partnership like this between our school and
Comunidad Connect that we will be able to fulfill our mission and grow in a
sustainable and responsible way.  
High quality
education can help to transform children, who in turn transform our
communities, cities, countries and the world for the benefit of us all. Quality
education helps to create citizens who understand politics and can make
beneficial changes to governmental systems, people who work together to
create strong, open institutions, and societies. We thank you in advance for
donating what you can to our construction fund, so that we can continue to
further the opportunities available to our students, community, country and
world.  The completion of this
exciting project will provide a space for higher learning for generations to
come.  We are grateful for this
opportunity and we look forward to your support.
Sincerely,

Julie Speier (Co-Founder/Director) and John
Crilly (Co-Founder/Director of Operations)

I have been accepted to attend a summer intensive learning programme in
Boulder, Colorado, June 23rd to August 2nd 2014. My goal is to raise funds in the amount of $4000 (R44 000) to make this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity a reality.
The
programs I will participate in are: 


Surfing
the Creative® International Youth Leadership Programme and  


Dance of Adolescence - training for practitioners working with youth around the world


During the training I will be exposed to a
variety of applications of arts-based practices such as Movement, Writing,
Voice, Theatre, Art, Ceremony, Intentional Dialogue and other forms of
Self-Expression. Each of the phases of this work will be taught through
5Rhythms® dance, writing, small group work, and diverse
creative and ritual activities. Furthermore, the training will include the
pedagogical and practical study of the maps/methods that shape the Surfing the Creative® Rites
of Passage Process developed by Melissa Michaels (Ed.D).
In between these programs I will also have the
opportunity to work in close contact with Melissa and her team establishing
more practical ways to apply this teaching within the communities where I live
and work.
Why not study in South Africa?
At present there
are no formal movement or art therapy training programmes available in South
Africa. Surfing The Creative® is the first contemporary youth leadership rites
of passage programme rooted in dance. Melissa Michaels, founder of this
programme, has been engaged in initiating, educating, and mentoring young
people all over the world for more than three decades. She has extensive
experience in working with developing communities and understands the
complexities of working with diverse youth. 
This movement based cross–cultural programme
offered by Melissa is not only unique but also appropriate for supporting youth
in underserved communities. Furthermore, this programme focuses on educational
aspects as well as arts-based therapeutic practices. This means working with
young people’s need for information, guidance, and clear understanding of how
to make positive choices are at the core of the process.If you would like to learn more about Melissa's wonderful work, please visit the Golden Bridge Organisation's website.
Who I am and why I am following my feet
My name is Elsmie and I am inspired by that
which stirs the creative soul. Painting, movement and writing are the ways
through which I express ideas or subjects that touch me deeply. During the
process of researching and writing the thesis for my MA Industrial Psychology at
the University of Johannesburg (2010), I studied the subjects of Positive
Psychology and Embodiment Theory or ‘the embodied mind’ intensively. This
experience inspired me to change my field of study to Clinical Psychology where
I hope to do more research on embodiment and the therapeutic value of the
creative arts. Currently I am completing undergraduate psychology subjects
through the University of South Africa (UNISA) which will enable me to apply
for an Honours and Master’s degree in Clinical Psychology. 
Since I started my studies as a psychology
student at UNISA, I have become involved in a joint project run by UNISA, the
Tygerberg Art Centre and a partnering NGO where one of the first phases of this
project is the establishment of an informal art centre in a multicultural community

Many students are now displaced due to the recent December 2013 conflict. We are seeking a budget of $8,500 to provide students with basic school supplies for their return to school. Stand 4 Education aims to reach this budget goal for the second and third term of the school year. 
After the mentioned budget have been raised Stand 4 Education's founder Mari Malek will travel back to South Sudan this year(date to be announced) and bring the students of the ""Malek Primary School"" supplies as well as bring women and girls sanitary products. Stand with Mari Malek to help the children of her native land. All the money raised will be spent on school supplies, educational materials such as backpacks, pencils, notebooks, colors etc... Mari will document this trip via photos and videos and keep you all updated of the trip through social media and our blog. Thank you for taking the time to read this and any donation will be greatly appreciated and mean the world to these children. 
If you are interested in becoming a sponsor or donating school supplies, shoes, clothing, etc... please email info@stand4education.orgFor more info about our efforts please visit www.stand4education.org

</p><h3>Introduction</h3><i>After a successful
crowd funding campaign five months ago we were able to build an extension to
our lovely skate park. This with the help of a wonderful international
(Germany, Maldives, UK, France and India) team whom through hard work and
dedication made this project a success. This couldn’t be possible without the
help of many donations through our indiegogo crowd funding campaign. </i><br/><i>The new skate park is a
huge success amongst our smaller children and our girls. Because of this
success we are in need of more protective gear and funds for transport. The
safety of our kids is our number one priority at the Kovalam skate club so we
ask your help to make this possible.<br/></i><p>

crowd funding campaign five months ago we were able to build an extension to
our lovely skate park. This with the help of a wonderful international
(Germany, Maldives, UK, France and India) team whom through hard work and
dedication made this project a success. This couldn’t be possible without the
help of many donations through our indiegogo crowd funding campaign. The new skate park is a
huge success amongst our smaller children and our girls. Because of this
success we are in need of more protective gear and funds for transport. The
safety of our kids is our number one priority at the Kovalam skate club so we
ask your help to make this possible.
S.I.S.P. in a nutshell
Sebastian
Indian Social Projects (S.I.S.P.) is a non-profit organization
working in the coastal region of Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of India’s
south-western state of Kerala. S.I.S.P. was founded by two Belgians, Paul
Van Gelder and Werner Fynaerts in 1996. S.I.S.P. strives
to accelerate social and economic change in the rural context by
collaborating with local community members to build a better
society where all people have easy access to education, health care,
and employment opportunities. S.I.S.P. has an explicit commitment to
remain disassociated from any religious activity and to work
both for and all side the poorest among all communities.
“No school, no skating”
The S.I.S.P.
Kovalam Skate Club is located at S.I.S.P., Kovalam, India and was founded in 2014
as a part of the bigger NGO S.I.S.P.  We had already co-founded earlier the
Kovalam Surf Club and the principle “no school, no surfing”, but during monsoon
we had no alternative. Now with free skateboarding lessons we can motivate the
school drop-outs also during monsoon to continue their education with “no
school, no skating”.
Skateboarding
has been proven to be extremely popular amongst youth from all cultures and
social backgrounds and is, just like surfing, a powerful tool to uplift
youngsters facing harsh living conditions. 
An advantage
of having an open-air park is that also girls get more attracted to skating.
Parents here often worry about their daughters practicing sports in the
presence of boys. Having a park in the school courtyard means that girls will
be able to skate in presence of adults in an easily visible place, so they will
feel more at ease. At present the girls often can’t join the boys in their
games because the girls’ clothes are impeding or the sport is culturally not
considered suitable for girls. Skating overcomes both these boundaries and
contributes to equality between boys and girls, which is still, unfortunately,
uncommon in most of India. 
Keep the dream alive
Today we are facing some difficulties with
traditional Indian customs. A lot of our girls in S.I.S.P. are interested to
learn more about skateboarding but aren’t allowed from their families. This
because they have to take the bus on their own towards the skate park. This is
also the case for our smaller children. We want these children to be able to
enjoy skateboarding as we know it is a powerfull tool for youth empowerment. 
Due to the popularity of our newest skate park
we have more and more children who want to participate in the project. We are
in lack of enough protective gear to keep the children safe. 
What do we need?

To bring our school girls and smallest children safely to the skate
park we’re in need of funds for a rickshaw service.
Helmets, knee pads, elbow pads and wrist protection for the new
members of the Kovalam Skate Club.

</div>
<p>Below BC is a new non-profit society created in 2015 with a quest to bring geology and the broader earth sciences alive for the public through education and a variety of media.</p>
<p>In 2016, we have set our sights on developing informative and fun online resources that are accessible to everyone. We started by photographing some of the spectacular mineral collections held out of public view at the Pacific Museum of the Earth at the University of British Columbia. These images, along with the stories behind each mineral, have been extremely popular with geologists and science enthusiasts everywhere.</p>
<div></div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452702520/p41zaq5pnqqcfuzby1ln.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>Our next step is to develop an intuitive 'online museum' to host these images and to showcase the geological treasures BC has to offer. That got us to thinking… rather than photographing images in 2-Dimensions, can we bring a full 3-Dimensions to this experience? Turns out we can, but we need your help. Below BC wants to buy a 3-D camera that is typically used for commercial product photography to allow us to record and manipulate an image from all angles. This will allow the viewer to experience the specimen as if you were holding it in your hand and looking up its life history all at the same time. </div><div></div>
<p>The funding will also go towards enhancing our website and hosting the online museum to increase the public’s access to the finest mineral specimens BC has to offer.</p>

<div></div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Any funding we raise will be invested directly into Below BC. If we reach our goal of $25,000, we will be able to purchase the 3D photography equipment and start to curate our enhanced website  and online museum. A portion of the funds will also cover the costs associated with photographing private rock, mineral and fossil collections throughout BC.</p>
<p>By contributing, you are helping bring a rich and varied geological collection to life! Specimens from across the province will be brought together in one place and accessible to everyone. For the scientific community, we will also include 'type specimens' to help with interactive education and research into the geological abundance of British Columbia.</p>
<p>We are offering some amazing rewards for your contribution!</p>

<li>$1000 - Family pass to the Britannia Mine Museum</li>

<div>* must be in BC, maximum one day of photography</div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>This project is just one of Below BC’s many initiatives to share BC’s rich and varied geological history with you. Our online museum will allow these usually inaccessible rocks, minerals and fossils to become a hands-on resource for all British Columbians. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<p>The risks for this project are minimal. If we do not meet our goals, then the funds raised will be used to fund other aspects of Below BC and help cover the costs of some of the outreach programs we already have in place (see <a href=""http://www.belowbc.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.belowbc.com</a> for a list of our 2016 activities). This is not our only source of funding - we are also looking at the research, education and geological organizations who offer a variety of grants. </p>
<p>In 2015, we achieved an exceptional amount with a relatively small grant. We have continuously experienced a demand from both the public and scientific community for the resources we are developing, and are keen to share our love of the natural world through geoscience education and outreach!</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>As they say “Sharing is Caring” – but for us that doesn’t necessarily mean money – help spread the word by supporting our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn… or your book club, hiking group, and even your friends. Use your imagination – we certainly do! </p>
<p>We are also co-hosting the upcoming Vancouver Gem and Mineral Show between March 11th and 13th. <a href=""https://www.universe.com/events/vancouver-gem-mineral-show-tickets-vancouver-70KV9R"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">100% of the ticket sales sold through this link</a> will be donated to Below BC! </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The Pop-Up Museum of Queer History is a grassroots organization that transforms empty spaces into temporary autonomous shrines dedicated to celebrating the rich, long, and largely unknown histories of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. We believe that our community - and especially our youth - deserve to know our history. If you don't know you have a past, you can't believe you have a future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cooperation <span>with</span> the Leslie Lohman Gay Art Foundation, the next Museum will pop up in NYC from August 6 - 25th. We need your help! We have artists, academics, and interested historians (amateur and professional!) creating exhibits on everything from intersex immigrants in the early 1900s, to the life of Carl van Vechten, to oral histories of American queers. We have a screening series of historical lesbian movies. We have a professional development class designed to teach secondary school teachers the importance of including queer lives and events in their curricula. Now, all we need is the money to make this happen.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Pop-Up Museum will make queer history visible in a fun, engaging way. We will show that queer history didn't begin with Stonewall, isn't only found in New York or San Francisco, and isn't just about well-off, white communities. We will bring our installations to any community interested in partnering with us. We will actively work with educators to use the museum as a teachable moment for youth of all genders and sexual orientations. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As a small community organization, even a $5 donation means a lot to us! Our goal of $5000 will enable us to create the next physical manifestation of the Pop-Up Museum, as well as provide a basic website to archive all the exhibits. Any money raised over our goal will go to creating future Pop-Up installations around the country, and strengthening our web presence, thereby making queer history available to everyone with an internet connection. We are thankful to be under the fiscal sponsorship of the MIX NYC Queer Experimental Film Festival, meaning that all donations are tax deductible. We are pursuing many other funding avenues, including grants, co-sponsorships with queer organizations, and individual donations.</p>

<p>     Hi! My name is R'mani Haulcy. Nice to meet you! Thank you for taking the time to view my campaign. So I know you must be wondering. What exactly does this person want? Well, I'm not a director for some amazing, up-and-coming movie. I'm not fundraising for a lethal disease, nor am I suffering from one so it can't be any of that. I'm just a teenage girl with big dreams and I need your help. </p>
</div>      I'm 16-years-old and broke but I don't want that to hold me back when I'm faced with new opportunities. I attend Walter Payton High School in Chicago, IL and I am a junior. I went to an elementary school sponsored by the University of Chicago. Because of this, I was challenged from the time I walked through the door and I've pushed myself ever since. My school was technology-driven and left me with knowledge of movie making (iMovie), song making (GarageBand), and much more. I've been working my butt off for as long as I can remember and I continue to work as hard as I can everyday. I have maintained a GPA of 4.7 out of 5, sometimes higher, since my freshman year of high school. I graduated from my elementary school as my class' valedictorian. I take advantage of the numerous opportunities at my school and challenge myself every year with college level classes. I'm also taking an eighth class at Harold Washington College downtown so that I can get general requirements for college out of the way and strengthen myself as an applicant. I am doing my part to make sure Stanford sees that I will be an amazing asset to their school. I'm also a goofy, fun-loving actress/writer/singer/musician/artist/whatever else you can think of. My extracurricular activities make me all the more well rounded. I have so much potential and I want to share it with the world. I just need a little help. <br/><div>
<p>     What I really need your help with is a summer program at Stanford University for high school students. Stanford is my dream school and this might be my only chance to see the school and make sure I want to go there before applying for early decision. I've only been on a plane once. I've never really had a chance to see the world. I'm extremely social and I love experiencing new things. Attending this program at Stanford would give me college credits that I can't get elsewhere and a summer I will never forget.</p>
<p>     I'm new to Indiegogo so I'm just trying it out. I can't find a scholarship that isn't too specific and my family just does not have the money so Indiegogo is my only hope. Please help as much as you can!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     I want to be inspiration for those around me. I find pride in giving others hope and I do so by being an example. If I can do it, anyone can. The elementary school that I went to wasn't top notch but I managed to get accepted into one of the top high schools in my city and now I want to go to a top college. I don't plan on letting anything stop me. The journey will just be a lot easier with the help of you guys out there. </p>
<p>     If I can't go to Stanford I won't die and I won't lose my job but I will miss out on an incredible opportunity and be a lot less prepared for the world around me. I've made a mistake by allowing myself to get so excited about the program but I have done so and it would heartbreaking if I could not attend the program simply because I could not afford it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     In the end I need $11,000. I have to pay for my plane tickets there and back home, room and board and at least eight college courses. It truly is the college experience encompassed in eight short weeks. In the end, the price for the program is $11,019 and that doesn't include toiletries that I have to buy and spending money for trips we take while we're there. I hope it goes well!</p>
<p>     If I don't reach my goal, the money will be saved for my college education. So many colleges have expensive application fees so any money that I can get would be tremendously helpful.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>     If you can't donate money, and I completely understand if you can't, you can also help me get that much closer to Stanford by telling people about my cause. I need as much help as i can get. Tell friends and family or colleagues. Who ever. All I ask is that you help me spread the word. If you help me get there, I promise I won't let anyone down. I won't take your money for granted. I'm going to do big things in life and if you help me, I'll help who ever else I can tenfold. Thank you again for your time. :)</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>This money will ensure that I am able to get first hand educational experience viewing wolves in the wild.  Most research of wolves has been done with captive wolves behind fences.  In recent years it has been discovered that there is a big difference between the lives of captive wolves and those of wild wolves.  To have the opportunity to have direct experience with wild wolves is the chance of a lifetime and one of the most profound learning opportunities available.  This experience will count directly toward my degree which will better prepare me for real world experiences after college. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are Heritage High School in East Harlem and we are starting a band! Founded in 1996 with help from Columbia University Teacher's College, the school was founded as an arts integration school. All of our 300 students take music and art. Only a few public high schools in New York City offer art or music, and we are fortunate to have both.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are starting a band! When music is studied without music making it is foreign and abstract. By putting instruments into the students' hands, music goes from being a subject of study to something that is alive and comes from within. It becomes personal. To help teach our students of their musical heritage, we will play and perform various musical styles that developed in Harlem such as jazz, blues, and afro-cuban jazz.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your money will help put instruments in students' hands. Students feel entrusted with instruments, empowered by playing in an ensemble, and engaged by making music. Many of our students come from humble backgrounds; 82% are on free or reduced-price lunch. To be responsible for an instrument of their own will be a profound experience for our students many of whom have rarely been trusted with valuable equipment. Also music education has been shown to positively influence students' self-confidence, creativity, and test scores in other subjects. Creating a band will encourage positive growth in our students and our school community as a whole.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Band programs also bring together parents and communities. Through public performances this ensemble can raise awareness for the school and bolster morale. When parents see their child learn an instrument and perform in concert they appreciate the opportunity that was offered their child and want to help the school. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need saxophones, trombones, trumpets, basses, pianos and drums. The best deals are available through ebay and I can play the instruments to inspect the quality of what is purchased. If you have an instrument you'd like to donate directly, please e-mail anavedo@schools.nyc.gov. We have had over 20 students cycle through the band program but there are only instruments enough for a few kids at a time. Some of the instruments that we do have are in disrepair or need to be replaced.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word! Post this link on your facebook page or share the link with interested friends! Every little bit helps! Again, if you have a trumpet, trombone, saxophone, keyboard, or bass that you would like to donate please contact me directly at anavedo@schools.nyc.gov.</p>

<h3><span>Background:</span></h3>
<p>I am an artist, lecturer and in 2011,<strong> I was awarded a PhD scholarship in Digital Performance by the Cultures of the Digital Economy Research Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK.</strong> My creative practice research investigates the convergence between science, art, touch and technology through drawing upon my interdisciplinary training in the fields of fine art, performance, audio programming, Chinese Medicine, biomedicine and clinical practice.</p>
<h3>Campaign:</h3>
<p><strong>My current work</strong><em><strong> Pulse Project</strong> </em>(a performance series that uses Chinese pulse reading and audio programming to create sonic portraits of individuals' interior embodied landsacpes)<strong> has been receiving increasing interest internationally. Unfortunately, my scholarship doesn't cover travel and accomodation for presenting my research at international conferences.</strong> I was really excited recently to be invited to present at a conference at Stanford University in California, but sadly, I had to decline due to lack of funding. Now I have been asked to present at an intensive international conference by Pauline Oliveros's organisation: The Deep Listening Institute and I don't want to have to say no again!</p>
<h3>Impact:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I have presented at many UK conferences and exhibited my artwork nationally and in Europe. However,<strong> presenting my work to an international audience is crucial for the development of my research in terms of connecting to a wider audience, to possible collaborators, to publishers, staging exhibitions, etc.</strong> This project reflects the current climate of convergence by bringing together art and science, the ancient and the modern, east and west.</p>
<p>The Deep Listening Institute is an internationally respected organisation that specialises in sonic research. They have invited me to present <em>Pulse Project</em> during the first week of July 2013. This would be an amazing opportunity to connect with other expert artists and academics who would be interested in my unique research and this exposure would certainly open up new avenues for the dissemination of my work (via publication, exhibition, collaboration, etc).</p>
<p><strong>But I need YOU to help me get to there and start the ball rolling or the emerging international interest in my research will grow cold and my research will never reach its true potential!!!!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>What the funding will cover:</strong></h3>
<p>The majority of the funds will go towards air fare. Current quotes for a round trip economy flight between London and New York on Delta is: £1,335.00 - GBP. The remainder would be spent on hotel stay (on average are £275 for 4 days). Return transportation between Penn Center to Albany runs at £50. The remainder would be spent on other transport costs (i.e., between the airport to Penn Central, between the hotel and the conference center, etc.), food, costs of printing up posters and business cards for desseminating research at this event.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal, the money will go into a travel fund to present my research internationally. This would profoundly affect my research and its capacity to reach wider audiences.</p>

Dignity Foundation is a global advocate for our youth and is fundraising $100,000 to sponsor 200 inner city kids at risk to participate in the Creating World Leaders program. We are a charitable organization located in the South Bronx. The 16 week Creating World Leaders journey includes a 3 part series of leadership and personal development training. Upon completion the youth leaders will have applied the tools they have learned by being in service to their community, by creating and completing a tangible community service ""World Leaders Project."" This 100 day journey is a life changing experience that will challenge and develop our youth into becoming the world leaders of tomorrow in a fast pace world.

A shout-out on your social network will be more than we could ever ask for!In 2002 a group of dedicated prison
staff had a vision to better the community they lived in… the Uganda
Prisons Gym was meant to facilitate martial training for the staff, and members of the public. However, due to great financial burdens this
dream is slowly withering away, but together we can make sure it
doesn't.
Like famous American author Zig
Ziglar once said “Remember, what you get by reaching your
destination isn't nearly as important as what you become by reaching
your goals - what you will become is the winner you were born to be!”
Help us reach this goal, so the
disadvantaged can stand a chance to become the winners we all believe
they can be.  What We Need
Our goal is to expand this family of aspiring individuals from 30 to... well we are hoping infinity! Wow! Sounds exciting right?
Well it is!But we need your help to raise 5,500$ for a secondhand boxing ring and training equipment aimed at benefiting the aging public facility located within the Luzira Prison Services compound.
Through sports the disadvantaged
youth of Uganda (and not only in Uganda) are equipped with life skills like; team work,
discipline, respect and maximization of their full potential, values
they would otherwise not had an opportunity to learn. So with your
contribution we intend to build a gym that will not only benefit the
current 30 members but also give room for many more to join this family.Give every and anything you can, tell your friends, family, workmates, classmates too, even that handsome or beautiful stranger you meet in the mall or on your walk about the wonder their contribution could make in the life of a disadvantaged youth.For USD 5,500:


We intend to spend .... on a used (secondhand) boxing ring


Boxing gloves


Used Shoes & Secondhand Training Kits


Renovation, aimed at not only
	making the gym safer for its users but also stand the test of time. 
	So we need:



Jerry-cans of Paint

Wood for Windows & Doors
    What You GetWe wanted to dispatch Ugandan t-shirts (""Somebody in Uganda Loves Me!"") to every contributor... however, Uganda is a land-locked country, and we were very disappointed to find out that even regular mail would charge us US$38 for each parcel.We've decided to go the digital way, as you can see from our 'rewards'.  If there's anything special you'd like us to do for you, we'd love to go that extra-mile... The ImpactUganda has the world’s youngest population, with over 78% below 30 years and of these 65% have no jobs.

But in all of these years he has never asked me for anything like money. He came to me in tears last week because his father has decided to no longer cover the cost of his tuition which is $3700 a semester at El Camino College. He has saved $1000 so far. He only has 2 semesters left and has paid successfully for the past 3 years and has a plan to pay his tuition for future semesters but unfortunately was caught out at the last minute by his father and needs to pay his tuition by this Friday January 31st. He has come up with a repayment schedule but I think it will strap him so badly that he will not be eating for  the 6 months if he does it.

It feels like a new exploration."" - Emma Roy</blockquote><blockquote>""We have a safe place here. People can lay out their practices and say this is what I do, this is how I benefited from it.

</tbody></table></div>","Boom, we nailed our goal! 
Help us stretch a bit further!Thanks to everyone who helped us reach our goal of raising $10,000!!!  We did this very quickly, around the 1/2 way point of the campaign.  We'd like to take it a step further now, and double our goal over the 2nd half of the campaign, effectively upgrading our operational armor from Leather to Chainmail!


This initial goal feels a lot like getting a nice piece of leather armor--it's way better than having nothing, but it's not like having chain mail!  If we can stretch and reach $20,000 in the next two weeks we're looking at being able to get some administrative support to free up the core staff of Buddhist Geeks for additional improvements to Buddhist Geeks programming.  It also gives us a solid buffer to be able to operate with a bit more confidence during times of great change.  We literally would not be doing this work if it weren't for your support, generosity, and interest.  Thank you for making this possible!Who Are We?For the past several years we been exploring the question, or koan, “How can we serve the convergence of Buddhism with rapidly evolving technology and an increasingly global culture?”Buddhist Geeks provides space for this ever deepening conversation. We aim to bring together perspectives from across the world, from across various fields of study, and of course from Buddhism. This year we will focus on a four day conference, a wide range of video conversations, and a member driven community of dedicated contemplatives hosting conversations at the intersection of Buddhism, technology and emerging global culture.What Do We Want to Continue?In 2014, we'll continue to convene a variety of conversations taking place at the intersection of Buddhism and contemporary life. These conversations, whether held at the Buddhist Geeks conference, through podcast interviews, retreats, or in peer-led community video hangouts--have augmented the Buddhist tradition and have supported the evolution of 21st century spirituality. We aim to continue to innovate and explore topics that may or may not be typically held in public space. What are some examples of Buddhist Geeks conversations?

Getting a Handle on Scandal - Diane Hamilton, Kenneth Folk, Sofia Diaz, Shinzen Young and Michael Zimmerman


Enlightenment Engineering - Mikey Siegal


Present Shock - Douglas Rushkof


Feminine Practice and Gender Roles - Sofia Diaz and Trudy Goodman


The Emerging Science of Mindfulness Meditation - David Vago


Mindful Media: A New Culture of Immersiveness on the Internet - Megan Miller

Where your coin goesThe money you contribute allows Buddhist Geeks to continue to offer the Podcast, Community, and Conference. Specifically, your money goes to Buddhist Geeks core team of 3 people, conference speakers, as well as the associated costs of design, legal, accounting, hosting fees and all the other little and big costs that go into running a growing organization. We bring in a modest amount of money from community memberships and conference ticket sales--and yet we depend on raising money from our network of listeners.  What do we need?In order to continue operating we need at least $10,000 for 2014. By contributing to this crowdfunder you will help offset the costs of both the conference and the community. Your support will allow us to keep the conversation alive and continue to make a difference in the world. The PerksWhat are people saying?Community Members""It feels to me like we are creating some model of group practice. The whole question of ‘how do I hold my identity lightly’ and ‘how do I recognize the three characteristics in a community setting’ and let things come together and fall apart and come together in new ways. I feel that this is the heart of individual practice in many ways. To see this on a community level really supports my practice. It feels like a new exploration."" - Emma Roy""We have a safe place here. People can lay out their practices and say this is what I do, this is how I benefited from it. People feel safe to do that here."" -Laurel Carrington
""For me there’s something sacred about this community. I have a sort of respect for it. I’m very selective about what to present, out of respect. I know that anytime I’ve been open and vulnerable here it’s been met with respect also. I can’t possibly express how beneficial this has been to my practice, this community."" -Duane MillerThe Conference

""The inaugural conference had incredible energy: the energy of potent potential. It's like being a kid: your whole life is still ahead of you."" 
""After spending over 35 years in the business world and often attending various conferences, I'd say the Buddhist Geeks Conference was once of best I've ever attended as far as flow, organization, welcoming feeling, motivation, etc."" 
""Stunned, floored, amazed by how wonderful it was especially for a first-time event.""

Create a packaged curriculum and the opportunity for expansion to other schools


Develop a CD to be used by teachers, students and parents


Write and publish a curriculum handbook

Create a online video support channel for teachers
Green Light's Goal is to hear children say ""YES"" to these statements:


"" I can make up my own songs""


"" When I hear music I feel like I know how to be a part of it""


"" I can read music notation""


"" I want to play music every day and learn an instrument""


"" Being involved in music makes me feel good""

Green Light's Goal is to hear classroom teachers say ""YES"" to these statements:


""Learning to teach music in my class has given me renewed confidence and energy""


"" Music helps my students learn better""


"" Music improves the overall atmosphere of my classroom""

How does it work?


Teacher Training:  Monthly Seminars provide classroom teachers with simple exercises and games, like teaching ABC's but with musical sounds and symbols.


Innovation and Cooperation:  Children create their own rhythm with classmates from the start.


Repetition:  Using simple phrases with different words and sounds deepens the students' experience and ability.


Foundation:  Strengthening basic musical building blocks assures future success.

This is a creative teaching modality that will:


Excite and harmonize the classroom


Bring calm and enjoyment to teachers and students


Give teachers a quick, straightforward and practical way to enter the world of music

What is the outcome?


Children receive all the benefits of musical training http://www.pbs.org/parents/education/music-arts/the-benefits-of-music-education/


Skills learned will greatly enhance later instrument study


Parents will become motivated by their kids' success


Provides a new way to learn spelling, times tables and memorization using rhythm

We have a K-3rd grade pilot program kicking off this fall at Woodland Star Charter School in Sonoma, CA.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I am one body, mind and spirit; suited with two feet, a cultivated open mind, and an ever building community with the world at my fingertips. I have repeatedly been told that I have a natural ability and enthusiasm that draws people together. I have also been told that I am courageous and inspiring. Without pride, I find that these strengths can be cultivated negatively or positively. I am only interested in what will truly fulfill Life ( with a capital “L”). And oh, I love the wonder that avails us as we intentionally cultivate those conditions which inspire a sustainable environment for just that.I have embraced my passion by cultivating deep listening, active and ongoing development while building a strong community who supports that goal.

<p>Since I graduated from high school 6 years ago from Summerfield Waldorf, I have been looking for what is most fitting in my academic path.

I have attended community college, “WWOOF”ed <a href=""http://www.wwoofinternational.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wwoofinternational.org/</a> in Hawaii and Oregon, by working on organic farms, gardens and at farmers markets by selling ayurvedic raw foods to our local community.</p>
<p>This spring I learned about the Weaving Earth Immersion Program in Sonoma County. While investigating the program and interviewing graduates, I heard my calling.

<h3>Information</h3></span><p></p>
<p><span>According to cancer.org, 577,190
Americans died from cancer in 2012. That’s more than 1,500 people a day. Many
of those who have passed away left small children behind. The fact that cancer
affects more than just those who are diagnosed is often overlooked. Keisha
Brown, the founder of the Angel Wings Fund, said this, “There are many men and
women who are affected by cancer. There are many men and women doing research
to find a cure. But what about the children, those who are not diagnosed with
cancer, but lose a parent because of it?” </span></p>
<p><span>Keisha was diagnosed with breast
cancer in 2007. Her biggest fear after hearing the diagnosis was what was going
to happen to her, then 1-year-old daughter, Angel. This is what led Keisha and
her husband, Damon, to later create the Angel Wings Fund, named after their
daughter.</span></p>
<p><span>The Angel Wings Fund is designed to
help children whose parent has passed away due to cancer in the form of a
college scholarship. It is also hoped that this will alleviate the burden
placed on the surviving parent. Another mission of the Angel Wings Fund is to
bring cancer education events to schools, making children aware of the many
types of cancer at an early age. The events can range from health fairs to
motivational speakers. </span></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise 500.00.  <span>In response to this problem our
group has devised a fundraising event that not only will raise funds for Angel
Wings, but also spreads awareness about all types of cancer. Through the “Knock
Cancer Out of the Park” Homerun Derby, participants will be able to take their
best swings at hitting as many homerun as they possibly can in a minute. The
catch behind the homerun derby is that similar to the MLB homerun derby, the
balls preceding the 10<sup>th</sup> and final out in our derby will also be
painted. However, unlike the MLB homerun derby our softballs will be painted
purple and have the Angel Wings logo on them not only to symbolize breast
cancer but also all other forms of cancer. Then depending on however many of
these “Cancer Awareness,” are hit out of the park local business will donate a
certain amount of money back to Angel Wings general scholarship fund. Therefore,
the more homeruns hit the better.</span></p>
<p><span> In addition to Homerun Derby are group will
also be selling event T-shirts, silicone event bracelets, and sponsorship
banners that will be displayed during the derby. Our goal behind this project
is to bring Central Michigan University, Central Michigan Athletics, and the
Mount Pleasant community together to help support this one great cause. </span></p>
<p>Indiegogo users will have the opportunity to receive a free pink silicone bracelet with a donation of 20 dollars and a purple commemorative softball with a 100 dollar donation or more. <br/></p>

I was able to overcome those challenges through costly trial and error and by fortune of having compassionate people walk into my life at right times encouraging and mentoring me to build a future that aligned with my strengths and true desires. From those experiences, I knew firsthand that with a slight push, direction, and a compelling story, anyone, especially youth, can realize their potential.</p>

<p><strong>What We are Doing</strong></p>
<p>In Washington D.C. from May 22-May 24, Athgo’s 5th Global Innovation Forum at the World Bank’s headquarters titled “<em>ICT Powering Constructive Entrepreneurs”</em>, will present intellectual, networking, and financial opportunities to over 200 promising young entrepreneurs and students, including those from underserved communities in nearly 50 countries. The industry leading knowledge framework, the <em>4-Pillars to Success</em>, designed by Athgo founder will power this year’s program, providing a unique opportunity for the youth to transform entrepreneurial ideas into reality, capitalizing on their brilliant capabilities to create value-producing start-ups.</p>
<p>Young and innovative students and entrepreneurs from over 41 countries have already been confirmed to attend along with 25 youth interns who will be given an opportunity to facilitate and administer the Forum. We have the support of the President of the Republic of Rwanda, Mr. Paul Kagame—an inspirational leader who knows the importance and value of young people in rebuilding his country after the Rwandan Genocide. We are fortunate to have the President, along with other top leaders, experts, and executives including those from Boeing, Chrysler, Intel, Daimler, Alcatel-Lucent, the World Bank, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Broadband Commission for Digital Divide, join Athgo’s Forum to help guide the young delegates on their trek of building 25 new constructive start-up concepts. </p>

That, in turn, helped me network with hundreds of like-minded individuals across the globe and map out projects and initiatives to explore and secure sustainable development.

Since then, I have been able to use much of the skills I acquired thanks to Athgo’s training, as well as the priceless guidance and mentorship of the organization's chairman, Armen Orujyan, and thus find myself in a position where I can genuinely feel I can make a positive impact on my society and the world at large.</p>

Athgo helped cultivate a passion for social entrepreneurship and international affairs. Since then, I have worked at Ashoka to help bring innovation and social entrepreneurship to higher-education. This led me to become the Director of Social Innovation at the International Youth Council. It is a global coalition of over 5,000 young leaders across 30 countries committed to sustainable development.</p>

Who We Are
We are a small NGO with an exemplary track record in guiding and advancing youth through building startup business for themselves and their communities. It all started with the story of Athgo's founder, Armen Orujyan, PhD.
""I was once myself young and underserved. I experienced many challenges growing up: from severe shortages of means and resources, to being type-casted because of my background and left out of social circles and networks, to encountering major problems landing jobs, and to being forced to choose work over school. I was able to overcome those challenges through costly trial and error and by fortune of having compassionate people walk into my life at right times encouraging and mentoring me to build a future that aligned with my strengths and true desires. From those experiences, I knew firsthand that with a slight push, direction, and a compelling story, anyone, especially youth, can realize their potential.
I founded Athgo when I was 24 as a stage for young and underserved people pursuing innovation and entrepreneurship but lacking direction, access, or means. We started with a pilot program at UCLA with 20 low-income students from six local community colleges. Success was instant and we moved forward. In the past decade, we have provided intellectual, financial, and networking opportunities to over 5,000 young innovative entrepreneurs and students from over 600 universities in nearly 80 countries through our Global Innovation Forums at the United Nations and the World Bank headquarters. Now, Athgo is a global entrepreneurial platform in consultative statuses with the UN Economic and Social Council and the UN Department of Public Information.""

Stories, such as of Amal Kabalan, Athgo 2011 alum from Lebanon continue to inspire us and fuel our mission: 
""The Athgo Forum gave me the tools of putting a technical project in a business context.

Since then, I have been able to use much of the skills I acquired thanks to Athgo’s training, as well as the priceless guidance and mentorship of the organization's chairman, Armen Orujyan, and thus find myself in a position where I can genuinely feel I can make a positive impact on my society and the world at large.

Student, Georgetown University 
Now:
Director of Social Innovation, The International Youth Council
My Athgo experience:
Before Athgo, I was not sure of what I wanted to study in college and what I wanted to do afterwards. After the Athgo forum in 2011, I developed a more comprehensive understanding of sustainable development and how entrepreneurship can be a means to further international development while creating green jobs. Athgo helped cultivate a passion for social entrepreneurship and international affairs. Since then, I have worked at Ashoka to help bring innovation and social entrepreneurship to higher-education. This led me to become the Director of Social Innovation at the International Youth Council. It is a global coalition of over 5,000 young leaders across 30 countries committed to sustainable development.

My Athgo experience:
Athgo helped me look at businesses and ideas in a more global perspective where I learned to leverage on resources around the world to get work done. The Innovation Forums also provided fantastic opportunities to Network with amazing minds whom up-to-date I am in touch with and who have assisted me in both business and social aspects of life. The Athgo programs also inspired me towards Entrepreneurship and gave me the foundational information on how to go about setting up my own business. I am currently running my Own Company called Moeish Consult Limited that focuses on Market Entry and Business Development Consulting plus fundraising for projects and companies in Africa. And last, the Athgo CEO, Dr. Armen Orujyan is also an inspiration to me and I am happy at the fact that to date, he still has the time to respond to an email or assist with queries I have.

<h2 align=""center""><strong>AllMaia’s goal is to promote the exchange of ideas, cultures, and philosophies among people around the globe. </strong></h2>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center"">With your support we can start by bridging the gap between American and Chinese youth.</p>
<h3><strong>Where We Come From</strong></h3>
<p>AllMaia was conceptualized in a Boston University dorm room where our co-founders, Jimmy Hu and Zak Eisenberg, were roommates. They quickly became friends, bonding through discussions about the differences between their cultures. Jimmy, a native of Nanjing, China, and Zak, from New York, had different upbringings, but shared the desire to learn about the world. Like Jimmy and Zak, students desire to learn about and experience the intricacies of societies that are not their own. AllMaia’s goal is to inculcate American youth with a true understanding of China, an important global power.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where We’ve Been: American Educators to China</strong></h3>

<p>More than 100 Chinese students attended <em>AllMaia</em> <em>Global Conferences</em>. Hosted in Nanjing, China, this past summer. The conferences brought American thinking, culture, and people to China. Lectures, discussions, and cultural activities during two, five-day, conferences challenged Chinese youth to explore new methods of critical thinking.</p>
<p>Our three pillars, Creativity, Social Sciences, and Ethics, gave students a holistic view of American society. Lectures surveyed American approaches to creative problem solving, political decision-making, and ethical dilemmas. Interactive discussions complemented lecture content, providing students a platform to debate contemporary world issues. Cultural activities completed our curriculum. Chinese students experienced American cultural activities, including music and card games. Throughout the process, we posed pressing world problems to student groups who then used the knowledge and tools acquired through the AllMaia curriculum to find solutions. In presentations, groups shared their solutions to issues including the international education gap, noise pollution, and overpopulation.</p>
<p>Imbedded in the <em>AllMaia</em> <em>Global Youth Conferences</em> were opportunities for Chinese students and American staff to interact and share their cultures. Each five-day conference concluded with a culture show where students showcased individual talents and Chinese traditions. (Video clips of performances are located in the Gallery.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where We’re Going: American Students to China</strong></h3>
<p>Study abroad is a unique component of college education. For many, this is the first experience of life outside the United States. Educational programs afford opportunities to learn about history, traditions, and culture. AllMaia will bring these rich components of a study-abroad program to high school students in an accelerated ten-day immersion experience.</p>
<p>Incorporating the fundamental aspects of study-abroad, academia and culture, AllMaia will go one step further, exposing students to the inner workings of Chinese business. Practicality will be at the core of our curriculum. Experience and knowledge acquired through lectures, panel discussions, and interactions with Chinese professionals will give students a multidimensional understanding of Chinese society.</p>
<p>Students will receive lectures from Chinese college professors and have the opportunity to interact with Chinese students, fostering lifelong friendships. Challenging preconceived notions about each other, AllMaia’s activities will push American students and their Chinese counterparts to overcome differences while working together to solve problems. Visiting companies, observing operations, and learning Chinese business etiquette will provide insight into the Chinese business world. Visiting historical sites and social centers, trying new cuisine, and participating in community service will complete AllMaia’s holistic approach to education through immersion.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where The Funding Goes</strong></h3>
<p>We need $18,000 to finance operational costs for the second phase of AllMaia’s education through immersion programming.</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deposits for flights</li>
<li>Deposits for logistics in China (classrooms, hotel, transportation, etc.)</li>

Almost $180,000 has been raised so far with a pro bono crew of dedicated volunteers moving this museum forward rapidly in the last two years.</p>

<p>Currently, architects have designed an innovative Lighthouse Resource Center to initiate our project and the group will seek grants from organizations such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Saving America's Treasures to help us with further museum development.</p>
<p>The structures that remain today are the 1864 Workshop, the 1864 Storage Vaults, the 1868 Lampshop, the 1869 Administration Building, the 1884 Workshop, the 1902 Lampshop (now called Building 10), and the 1915 Foundry (now called Building 11). In 1991 JHPA prepared a conditions assessment and adaptive reuse study for the complex resulting in the stabilization of two historic structures. In 2000 JHPA prepared construction documents for the New York City Economic Development Corporation which included a complete exterior restoration and interior build-out of Building 11 along with an exterior restoration of Building 10. Construction was completed in 2005.</p>
<p><br/>Shortly after opening, we will continue our mission in developing an an adjacent, far-larger building on the 10-acre city site and would require a major interior renovation and an investment of some $15 million.<br/><br/>The National Lighthouse Museum expects to attract many of the two million tourists yearly, who take the Staten Island Ferry, which docks a short distance from the old depot. In addition, plans are to introduce the maritime world to classes of children through regular class trips - teaching physics, history, geography, geometry and economics in a unique and exciting way.<br/>The US coastlines and its environs have over 600 lighthouses of the 15,000 worldwide and due to modern navigational technology, many are endangered of being lost, decommissioned and abandoned...preservation is key!</p>
<p>In the past, merchants and seamen frustrated with shipwrecks due to the inability to navigate US coastlines requested more lighthouses be built - basically lighthouses were like the superhighways of the 1800's, allowing ships to navigate up and down the coasts and harbors with the guiding lights of the lighthouses, avoiding navigational disasters.</p>

We are ready to go, we  need your support to open the National Lighthouse Museum on Staten Island, New York City 
“""Lighthouse beacons continue to burn bright, guiding distressed ships to safety. ~ Tom Baker”
Raising the sizable sum of money needed has been left almost entirely to the directors and loyal supporters of the St. George Staten Island plan. And it’s an increasingly heavy lift. 
The museum has a new board with new energy and ideas, but it’s plagued with the same problem it has always had. What this project has always needed is backers with deep pockets. So far, they haven’t materialized but that wont deter the mission to open.The goal is high because it's expensive to build a tribute to lighthouses & maritime history New York City located at  the original site of the US Light House Services General Depot in the mid 1800's, servicing all lighthouse operations in the nation.
We are  targeting a Summer 2013 opening of the U. S. National Lighthouse Museum's Educational Resource Center to be located in New York near the Staten Island Ferry Terminal on Staten Island, New York City; and can't do it without your support!
In 2010 a group of Lighthouse Preservationists and Maritime historians revived the charter to build the National Lighthouse Museum on Staten Island NY.   They raised a good deal of money and now need $600,000 for design/ display development, fabrication and construction; and another $400,000 for initial operations including equipment and program expenses to launch the Center. Almost $180,000 has been raised so far with a pro bono crew of dedicated volunteers moving this museum forward rapidly in the last two years.

Who we are:
The Board of Trustees are a group dedicated to the preservation of Lighthouses and US Maritime History.  Their goal is to build the National Lighthouse Museum on Staten Island New York.
 Executve Director Linda C. Dianto, MS
President Jack Vokral,PE
1st Vice President Captain Joseph Ahlstrom, Prof. SUNY Maritime
2nd Vice President John Arntzen, Pres. ACTA Maritime Development
Treasurer Richard M. Prinzi, Jr., CPA
Secretary Maryann Piazza, Majestic Vending, Inc.  
Members:
Chris Bendow, Esq.   Charles Di Bartolo, Pres. BetterBizWorks, Inc   Jim Dunlap LCDR USCG (Ret.) Fresnel Lens/Lighthouse Preservationist   Ralph Eshleman, PhD, Museum Director (Ret.)   Paul Foster, Esq., Playwright   Bruce Liozzi, Officer, Bay St. Landing Board   Aaron Luwisch, Owner, Victory Sports Arena   Alexander Psomas, CFA   Captain Thomas Walsh, Sandy Hook Pilots   Wayne Wheeler, Pres. US Lighthouse Society   Robert Williams, Prof., Wagner College

 This location is the original site of the US Light House Services General Depot in the mid 1800's, servicing all lighthouse operations in the nation. The navigational history of this site as the ""Mother Ship"" of lighthouses nationwide is vital to preserve and educate future generations to come on their purposes.


Currently, architects have designed an innovative Lighthouse Resource Center to initiate our project and the group will seek grants from organizations such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Saving America's Treasures to help us with further museum development.
The structures that remain today are the 1864 Workshop, the 1864 Storage Vaults, the 1868 Lampshop, the 1869 Administration Building, the 1884 Workshop, the 1902 Lampshop (now called Building 10), and the 1915 Foundry (now called Building 11). In 1991 JHPA prepared a conditions assessment and adaptive reuse study for the complex resulting in the stabilization of two historic structures. In 2000 JHPA prepared construction documents for the New York City Economic Development Corporation which included a complete exterior restoration and interior build-out of Building 11 along with an exterior restoration of Building 10. Construction was completed in 2005.
Shortly after opening, we will continue our mission in developing an an adjacent, far-larger building on the 10-acre city site and would require a major interior renovation and an investment of some $15 million.The National Lighthouse Museum expects to attract many of the two million tourists yearly, who take the Staten Island Ferry, which docks a short distance from the old depot. In addition, plans are to introduce the maritime world to classes of children through regular class trips - teaching physics, history, geography, geometry and economics in a unique and exciting way.The US coastlines and its environs have over 600 lighthouses of the 15,000 worldwide and due to modern navigational technology, many are endangered of being lost, decommissioned and abandoned...preservation is key!
In the past, merchants and seamen frustrated with shipwrecks due to the inability to navigate US coastlines requested more lighthouses be built - basically lighthouses were like the superhighways of the 1800's, allowing ships to navigate up and down the coasts and harbors with the guiding lights of the lighthouses, avoiding navigational disasters.
We are a 501-c3 charitable organization and all donations are tax deductible

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>We are the New Democratic Youth of Prince Edward Island.  For the first time our numbers are really growing and we want to start building a viable third party here on PEI.  We want to send 20 of our members to the Federal NDP Leadership Convention in Toronto on March 23-24 to show our fellow members on the national level that we are here and ready to work together for a better Canada.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>With a successful campaign we will be able to send a strong delegation of NDP of PEI youth members to a National Convention for the first time.  We have the opportunity to start building from the ground up a talented group of young members interested in getting involved in the party on a provincial level.  Our growth has already begun and this amount of interest in the party is a first for the Island.   Please help us grow.  </div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise enough money for group transportation and accommodation to and from Toronto from PEI for 20 of our youth delegates.  All money, raised regardless of if we reach our total goal, will go directly towards transportation and accommodation costs for this trip.  Any additional money will be used to further build the youth wing on PEI at our Provincial Convention in April.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help us in any way you can! The party on PEI is building and begin to shape a viable alternative to the 2 party system currently in place here.  Please send this link to NDP members and supporters across the country through email, facebook, twitter, anything.  Change will happen here, please help us and be a part of it! </p>

<p><strong>Our Story </strong></p>
<p>Our skills sets lie in developing electronic solutions for automating refrigeration systems for the HVAC&amp;R industry. Due to the propriety nature of the business our projects are unfortunately always closed source not to mention expensive. But we were so inspired by the open source nature and price point of the Raspberry Pi  project that we wanted to give back something to the community. After a bit of research we found that while there  were a lot of add-ons they were fairly limited in peripherals and lacked the peripherals needed for home automation projects. So if your in the process of automating your home and you want to use the Raspberry Pi to do it then the PIC PI offers an affordable solution for you.  </p>
<p><strong>Raspberry PI open source Software </strong></p>
<p>The pic chip will come pre-programmed (this software will be open source too) and all the control of the PIC Pi hardware can be achieved easily though Programming the Raspberry PI using the python libraries developed for the PIC PI hardware. In the future we will also be writing bash commands for  Raspbain to control the PIC PI hardware. If you have a Micorchip programmer you will also be able to write your own code for the pic chip . Here is a link to the <a href=""http://pic-pi.com/Python%20API.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">python API</a>    </p>

Our Story 
Our skills sets lie in developing electronic solutions for automating refrigeration systems for the HVAC&R industry. Due to the propriety nature of the business our projects are unfortunately always closed source not to mention expensive. But we were so inspired by the open source nature and price point of the Raspberry Pi  project that we wanted to give back something to the community. After a bit of research we found that while there  were a lot of add-ons they were fairly limited in peripherals and lacked the peripherals needed for home automation projects. So if your in the process of automating your home and you want to use the Raspberry Pi to do it then the PIC PI offers an affordable solution for you.  
Raspberry PI open source Software 
The pic chip will come pre-programmed (this software will be open source too) and all the control of the PIC Pi hardware can be achieved easily though Programming the Raspberry PI using the python libraries developed for the PIC PI hardware. In the future we will also be writing bash commands for  Raspbain to control the PIC PI hardware. If you have a Micorchip programmer you will also be able to write your own code for the pic chip . Here is a link to the python API    
PIC Pi open source Hardware 
Schematic
1 x RS232
1x RS485
1x Real Time Clock 
2x 240Vac Relays rated to 10A
2x Analog Outputs 0-10V
22x Pins individually settable as Analog inputs or Digital Outputs 
Production Ready Unit 
We have a Production ready unit, the hardware is 100% tested and working. We have the Software is 100% finished and tested for functionality. 
What can i do with it ?
Once we have finished the PIC PI Python hardware libraries we will work on developing some open source applications here are some of the projects we will be working on  
- Switching lights over the internet 
- Web controlled thermostat 
- Web controlled pet feeder 
How can i help
I would love to get this product off the ground, but i dont have enough money to cover the intial start up costs of a build ie stencil, surface mount machine programming, board assembly. If i get enough interest then i will be able to afford the first build of this product and get the ball rolling if not the i cannot afford to make this product avaliable to the public. 
Production plan
We will be outsourcing the manufacturing to ACD in Melbourne we have had a long relationship with them and we trust there quality of manufacturing. If we reach our target we will run a build this should take around a week.

<p><span>In our community, which connects online year-round, there are about 100 future pastors at various stages in the ordination process. Some are attending seminary.

<h3></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">     We are a small Catholic elementary school with a big heart. In fact, in our area we are known as “The Little School That Could”. In 2012 against the odds we raised the money and created a plan to stay open when faced with closing. We “Prayed like it all depended on God, and worked like it all depended on us”. Our prayers were answered, and we are taking this great blessing we’ve been given and working the plan. Part of that is adding a preschool to our campus.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">      </span>Our playground is in dire need of a fence. It is bordered on one side by a street and another by an alley with only a chain put up to block cars during recess. While we have a vigilant cadre of staff and volunteers supervising recess, we need to make it safer for the very young children we will be welcoming next year. Younger children are often unaware of the danger posed by vehicles and are much safer playing in an enclosed area which can be more closely supervised.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">      Also, next year we will have several students on the Autism spectrum who tend to wander away when upset. Bolting and wandering are the leading cause of death among Autistic children.<span style="""">  </span>A fenced playground would deter wandering children and help ensure their safety.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">       I</span>n addition, we want to make our playground more inviting and fun for students with physical disabilities. Remember waiting in line for your turn on the swings? What if it was never your turn, because you couldn’t use the swing safely? One of our students, Mady, has cerebral palsy, and has outgrown a swing provided by her parents. We want to install a swing that will be fun for her right through 6<sup>th</sup> grade, and that other students will be excited to use. Not her “special” swing, but <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">everybody’s</span> swing.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">       </span>At St. Boniface Catholic School, we want all children to feel safe and welcome… and to have fun. You can be a part of that.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</p>

</div></div>","We are a small Catholic elementary school with a big heart. In fact, in our area we are known as “The Little School That Could”. In 2012 against the odds we raised the money and created a plan to stay open when faced with closing. We “Prayed like it all depended on God, and worked like it all depended on us”. Our prayers were answered, and we are taking this great blessing we’ve been given and working the plan. Part of that is adding a preschool to our campus.
      Our playground is in dire need of a fence. It is bordered on one side by a street and another by an alley with only a chain put up to block cars during recess. While we have a vigilant cadre of staff and volunteers supervising recess, we need to make it safer for the very young children we will be welcoming next year. Younger children are often unaware of the danger posed by vehicles and are much safer playing in an enclosed area which can be more closely supervised.
      Also, next year we will have several students on the Autism spectrum who tend to wander away when upset. Bolting and wandering are the leading cause of death among Autistic children.  A fenced playground would deter wandering children and help ensure their safety.
       In addition, we want to make our playground more inviting and fun for students with physical disabilities. Remember waiting in line for your turn on the swings? What if it was never your turn, because you couldn’t use the swing safely? One of our students, Mady, has cerebral palsy, and has outgrown a swing provided by her parents. We want to install a swing that will be fun for her right through 6th grade, and that other students will be excited to use. Not her “special” swing, but everybody’s swing.
       At St. Boniface Catholic School, we want all children to feel safe and welcome… and to have fun. You can be a part of that.
 
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET
       We need $5,000 to add a fence and swing to our playground. The project cost for the fence is $3,784 for materials, $1,960 for installation. The swing we would like to purchase is a Jennswing, which includes the swing, safety harness and chains to hang it from a frame we already have. It is priced at $499. We have raised about $1,000 already.
       If we don’t meet our entire goal, in the interest of safety for all the children, the money will go toward installing a fence. (But our fundraising will continue- Mady’s getting that swing!)
       In addition to the satisfaction of knowing you've made the world a little safer, a little more compassionate and a lot more fun, we have some thank you gifts to show our appreciation for supporting our school. Our students are our greatest ambassadors, and their personal touch and talent comes through in everything from a hand-written thank-you note to a St. Boniface family portrait, autographed by all our students.

We were upset because of the dirt and graffiti that littered our streets.  And, because of this, the Garden and Mural program was created. All of our murals are painted by hundreds of people working collaboratively who live in the community. Our gardens are planned and seeded by kids and adults with input from the community. <strong>Cooperation and collaboration are key. </strong>Each garden and mural project takes months of planning but it has changed people at their core.<strong> Liter and graffiti have lessened</strong>, collaboration is up, we are more aware of what we eat, we now know how to plant and maintain a vegetable garden, and we all are more appreciative of nature. And, because of our work <strong>others have been inspired</strong>. We now have a beautiful new playground, and more trash cans in our community.</p>
<p>Our program<strong> has been so successful mobilizing the community</strong> that our gardens and murals have been featured nationally, we participated in a public service announcement at the bequest of the NYC Mayor's Office,<strong> school capital construction campaigns have taken place after our garden programs have shown real community interest</strong>, <strong>community investments of over 20,000,</strong> and we wrote a book that is available at several public libraries in NYC and Connecticut.</p>

<p>A secessionist rebellion that began in Mali's north early this year, and the ensuing fighting that occurred between the rebel group and the Malian army, produced several hundred thousand internally displaced persons and refugees. The rebellion was eventually hijacked by armed Islamist groups who currently control the north of the country. </p>
<p>A peaceful resolution is looking increasingly unlikely and there is a real possibility of armed intervention. In any case, the refugee situation persists.  </p>
<p>I am trying to raise $1,000 for Relief International, an organization that is providing humanitarian support for Malian refugees in Niger. If the campaign is funded, I will teach 100 different people how to draw camels in a 24 hour period in Bamako, Mali. I will document this process and the video will be available to backers of the campaign. </p>
<p>The money raised by this campaign goes directly to the Relief International paypal account. Any amount raised over $1,000 will also go directly to Relief International. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why Camel Drawing?</h3>
<p>For more information on why I believe so strongly in camel drawing, please see the video above. You can also visit my website <a href=""http://howtodrawcamels.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://howtodrawcamels.com</a> and <a href=""http://philintheblank.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://philintheblank.net</a>. Do not take the camel drawing too seriously, please.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why Relief International? </h3>
<p>Relief International was initially recommended to me by a friend who was familiar with their work. After learning more about their efforts, which are holistic and exhaustive in nature, I spoke directly to a RI representative and was once more encouraged by the organization. </p>
<p>To get a sense for their approach, I recommend reading this PDF report that they released in July: </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ri.org/files/uploads/RI_Mali_Refugees_in_Tahoua_Niger_Assessment_Report.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ri.org/files/uploads/RI_Mali_Refugees_in_Tahoua_Niger_Assessment_Report.pdf</a> </p>
<p>The money from this campaign is specifically targeted to go to Relief International's support of Malian refugees. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>For more information on the situation in Mali...</h3>
<p>Quality reporting on Mali has been limited, but there are a number of journalists, analysts and researchers who have been providing valuable information on the situation. </p>
<p>I recommend reading this blog post from journalist Peter Tinti, which explains the hazy reporting situation while offering some key reads that provide a strong background on the current crisis: </p>

<p><strong>Help me complete an unprecedented camel drawing mission while supporting humanitarian efforts for Malian refugees. Even if you cannot donate, please consider sharing this campaign with someone (or everyone) that you know. </strong></p>
</div></div>","A secessionist rebellion that began in Mali's north early this year, and the ensuing fighting that occurred between the rebel group and the Malian army, produced several hundred thousand internally displaced persons and refugees. The rebellion was eventually hijacked by armed Islamist groups who currently control the north of the country. 
A peaceful resolution is looking increasingly unlikely and there is a real possibility of armed intervention. In any case, the refugee situation persists.  
I am trying to raise $1,000 for Relief International, an organization that is providing humanitarian support for Malian refugees in Niger. If the campaign is funded, I will teach 100 different people how to draw camels in a 24 hour period in Bamako, Mali. I will document this process and the video will be available to backers of the campaign. 
The money raised by this campaign goes directly to the Relief International paypal account. Any amount raised over $1,000 will also go directly to Relief International. 


Why Camel Drawing?
For more information on why I believe so strongly in camel drawing, please see the video above. You can also visit my website http://howtodrawcamels.com and http://philintheblank.net. Do not take the camel drawing too seriously, please.


Why Relief International? 
Relief International was initially recommended to me by a friend who was familiar with their work. After learning more about their efforts, which are holistic and exhaustive in nature, I spoke directly to a RI representative and was once more encouraged by the organization. 
To get a sense for their approach, I recommend reading this PDF report that they released in July: 
http://www.ri.org/files/uploads/RI_Mali_Refugees_in_Tahoua_Niger_Assessment_Report.pdf 
The money from this campaign is specifically targeted to go to Relief International's support of Malian refugees. 


For more information on the situation in Mali...
Quality reporting on Mali has been limited, but there are a number of journalists, analysts and researchers who have been providing valuable information on the situation. 
I recommend reading this blog post from journalist Peter Tinti, which explains the hazy reporting situation while offering some key reads that provide a strong background on the current crisis:

I would also recommend following his twitter account (@petertinti) along with the following list of people who provide excellent analysis and reporting in English.
