<p>Hi, My name is Raffaele Ferrari a Photographer and Visual Artist and i'm raising funds to publish my first photographic book  about India, a  story that I have been working  for the past 10 years.</p>

<p>The end result is a series of images presented in this book in which I try to manage and match portraits, street photography and landscapes together as a cohesive story about my vision of India.

</div>
<div class=""full-description"">
<p>The 12:00 Noon Project is a global photography project aimed at opening the public's eyes as to what life is like across the globe. My goal is to put at least 500 disposable cameras in the hands of children and teenagers across the globe. At twelve o clock every day they will be asked to take one picture using the disposable camera, capturing what it is like in the environment they live in. When they are done with the camera, they will send it back to me for developing. I will sort through the thousands of photos to select the most breathtaking images that capture 12:00 across the globe. My goal is to open people's eyes and let them see that the world around them is far from the only world around.</p>
<h3 class=""dotty""><span>Risks and challenges</span></h3>
<p><span>It will be challenging to find 500 people to send the cameras to, as well as get all the film back and develop it, but if all goes well, this will be a remarkable way to capture what the world looks like through so many people's eyes.</span></p>
<h3 id=""faq"">FAQ</h3>
<p><span class=""question"">I want to be a part of the project, how can I get involved?</span></p>
<div class=""faq-answer"">
<p>It's easy! Just pledge a minimum of $10 and select the reward ""A disposable camera so you can partake in the project!"" Message me with your mailing address and once the project hits $500, I will be sending out the first batch of cameras. The second batch will be sent went the rest of the funding is finished. If all of the disposable camera rewards are taken, please message me to see if there is still room for more participants in the project. Thanks!</p>
<p><span class=""question"">What do you plan on doing with the photos?</span></p>
<div class=""faq-answer"">
<p>Simple question. Complex answer. The result of the project will totally depend on what I receive back from the participants in the project. Originally this was going to be a strictly analog project, but I have now allowed people with digital cameras to participate which creates a new dynamic to the project. There will most definitely be a photo book made from the best photos from the project, as well as a paperback book outlining the project. I am also hoping to put together a short documentary if I can gather enough material. It all depends on what I wind up with in the end!</p>
<p><span class=""question"">Why disposable cameras?</span></p>
<div class=""faq-answer"">
<p>Many people have asked why I have chosen to use disposable cameras instead of going with digital images. I have many answers for this, but my answer has also changed since the project starter. In the beginning of the project I really wanted to be able to get cameras to people who would never have the opportunity to probably ever take a picture. I also wanted the opportunity to receive the negatives from the cameras so I could do some post production after I received the cameras back. This is why I originally decided to go with disposable cameras, I thought it was more personal. Since the project started however I have gotten requests from people who would like to participate in the project but they would like to use a digital camera. I have no objections to that, however my primary focus is on the disposable cameras.</p>
<p><span class=""question"">What are your costs and expenditures for this project?</span></p>
<div class=""faq-answer"">
<p>Well, I have calculated that if I buy the cameras all at one time (pending successful funding completion) I can 200 cameras for around $550. The cost of shipping will vary depending on where I need to ship the camera to, and then I need to pay for the return shipping. I have estimated about a $15 cost for each person in edition to the $550 for the 200 cameras. If the project gets funded, I will start with 200 participants at an estimated cost break of $3550. That cost only covers the shipment and purchase of the cameras. It doesn't take into consideration the post-production and editing that will go on after the I receive the cameras from the participants. This project is an expensive project and that is why I am so grateful Kickstarter has backed me in helping me get this project out there in the world.</p>

My multicultural upbringing surely had advantages, but I also remember disliking it and wanting to be ‘just Belgian’ or 'more Japanese'. Last year, right after the birth of my daughter Yuna, I decided to compare my experiences with other hāfu.</p><p>This resulted in <a href=""http://www.hafu2hafu.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hāfu2Hāfu</a>; a photographic project in which I investigate what it means to be hāfu. By portraying and interviewing other hāfu and by sharing their unique question to you – the viewer – we create a dialogue about identity and stimulate self-reflection. I hope the combination of portraits and questions will result in more acceptance and mutual understanding between Japanese hāfu, their (non) Japanese family, friends, colleagues or classmates.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>“I used some questions from the project to discuss childhood issues caused by cultural differences between my parents with them.” </i>– Anonymous hāfu</p><p>What started as a small personal project, has become larger than I could have imagined: Hāfu2Hāfu is constantly growing and reaching more and more people. With 90 photos and questions from hāfu from 65 different 'other' countries, it represents and connects a community of people with one Japanese parent throughout the world. The project has also been picked up by international media and I have been asked to give presentations and workshops.  </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">•••••</h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>With your help I hope to cover more countries and bundle these portraits and questions in a beautiful book.</strong></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">•••••</h3><div>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">••• ​What<strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> is hāfu •••</strong>
</h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Hāfu/haafu is the Japanese word used for somebody with a mixed background. It comes from the English word ‘half’, referring to the half foreign and half Japanese-ness. Although it is the most frequently used label for self-introduction by hāfu in Japan, it is important to note that some find it discriminatory. The use of labels is an important part of the discussion in this project.</span></p>
<div><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">••• The process •••</h3></div>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>“A portrait is not made in the camera, but on either side of it” – Edward Steichen</i></p>
<p>Before photographing participating hāfu, we have a very open personal conversation in which many aspects of being hāfu are discussed: what are the advantages and disadvantages, where do we belong and where do we want to belong? At the end of the interview, before taking the portrait, the interviewed hāfu formulates the ultimate question he or she wants to ask other hāfu. Hence the name of the project: Hāfu2Hāfu.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>••• Diversity in Hāfu •••</b></h3>
<p>Meeting hāfu with different combinations of nationalities with Japanese is important because 'the other nationality' is probably the most important factor in how we all experience our hāfu-ness. The ultimate goal is to have at least one photo and question from every nationality, mixed with Japan. There are 193 recognised countries (UN), so there are 192 possible combinations of countries, mixed with Japan.</p>
<p>On top of the variation of nationalities, I try to cover diversity in other aspects that influence hāfu-identity such as: place of birth and upbringing, age, gender, the parent’s marital status, religion, siblings, the knowledge of Japanese or other languages and sexual preference. I have now photographed and interviewed more than 90 hāfu from over 65 'other' countries from every continent, with different profiles. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">••• Website<strong> •••</strong>
</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.hafu2hafu.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hāfu2Hāfu.org</a> is where you can see all the portraits and where viewers can react to the questions asked by the participating hāfu. Other hāfu, their families, friends and people without mixed heritage can share their experiences with others. Today, the website counts more than 500 reactions from all over the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">••• Pre-order The Book •••</h3>
<p>Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could bundle all these portraits and questions in a beautifully crafted photo book? I believe this is a logical next step for the project and hope to make this happen with your help. </p>
<p>The book will hold portraits and questions from at least 120 hāfu from different countries or with different profiles. The final number will depend on the funding we manage to raise here. </p>
<p>The book will be produced and shipped by mid 2019, after completion of the project. The definitive format and finishing will be determined in a later stage.</p>

My multicultural upbringing surely had advantages, but I also remember disliking it and wanting to be ‘just Belgian’ or 'more Japanese'. Last year, right after the birth of my daughter Yuna, I decided to compare my experiences with other hāfu.This resulted in Hāfu2Hāfu; a photographic project in which I investigate what it means to be hāfu. By portraying and interviewing other hāfu and by sharing their unique question to you – the viewer – we create a dialogue about identity and stimulate self-reflection. I hope the combination of portraits and questions will result in more acceptance and mutual understanding between Japanese hāfu, their (non) Japanese family, friends, colleagues or classmates.“I used some questions from the project to discuss childhood issues caused by cultural differences between my parents with them.” – Anonymous hāfuWhat started as a small personal project, has become larger than I could have imagined: Hāfu2Hāfu is constantly growing and reaching more and more people. With 90 photos and questions from hāfu from 65 different 'other' countries, it represents and connects a community of people with one Japanese parent throughout the world. The project has also been picked up by international media and I have been asked to give presentations and workshops.  •••••With your help I hope to cover more countries and bundle these portraits and questions in a beautiful book.•••••

 
••• ​What is hāfu •••

Hāfu/haafu is the Japanese word used for somebody with a mixed background. It comes from the English word ‘half’, referring to the half foreign and half Japanese-ness. Although it is the most frequently used label for self-introduction by hāfu in Japan, it is important to note that some find it discriminatory. The use of labels is an important part of the discussion in this project.
••• The process •••

“A portrait is not made in the camera, but on either side of it” – Edward Steichen
Before photographing participating hāfu, we have a very open personal conversation in which many aspects of being hāfu are discussed: what are the advantages and disadvantages, where do we belong and where do we want to belong? At the end of the interview, before taking the portrait, the interviewed hāfu formulates the ultimate question he or she wants to ask other hāfu. Hence the name of the project: Hāfu2Hāfu.

••• Diversity in Hāfu •••
Meeting hāfu with different combinations of nationalities with Japanese is important because 'the other nationality' is probably the most important factor in how we all experience our hāfu-ness. The ultimate goal is to have at least one photo and question from every nationality, mixed with Japan. There are 193 recognised countries (UN), so there are 192 possible combinations of countries, mixed with Japan.
On top of the variation of nationalities, I try to cover diversity in other aspects that influence hāfu-identity such as: place of birth and upbringing, age, gender, the parent’s marital status, religion, siblings, the knowledge of Japanese or other languages and sexual preference. I have now photographed and interviewed more than 90 hāfu from over 65 'other' countries from every continent, with different profiles. 
 
••• Website •••

Hāfu2Hāfu.org is where you can see all the portraits and where viewers can react to the questions asked by the participating hāfu. Other hāfu, their families, friends and people without mixed heritage can share their experiences with others. Today, the website counts more than 500 reactions from all over the world. 
 
••• Pre-order The Book •••
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could bundle all these portraits and questions in a beautifully crafted photo book? I believe this is a logical next step for the project and hope to make this happen with your help. 
The book will hold portraits and questions from at least 120 hāfu from different countries or with different profiles. The final number will depend on the funding we manage to raise here. 
The book will be produced and shipped by mid 2019, after completion of the project. The definitive format and finishing will be determined in a later stage.


These are mockups of the book. The final version will look differently.
 
••• Pre-Order A Special Limited Edition Book •••

Each Special Limited Edition Book will have a unique high quality photo inlaid on the cover;
The number of Special Edition Books will be equal to the number of photos in the book;
Your book will be signed, numbered and will include a hand written thank you note.


••• Order Prints •••
Display your favourite portrait or a series of photos from the Hāfu2Hāfu project and amaze your friends with this beautiful conversation starter. You can select photographs from the current selection immediately, or wait and order your prints later when there are more photos to choose from.

30 x 20 cm (12 x 8 inches);
Black and white;
Printed on high quality Fujifilm Original Photopaper;
Question to you and basic information printed on separate card.



 
••• Why € 30.000? •••
For this campaign I have set a minimum amount of € 30.000. This is the amount I need to produce and deliver a beautifully crafted book with approximately 120 images and questions of hāfu from different countries with various backgrounds. 
But I aim at raising more funds, so that we can make a bigger book with even more images than that!


For € 50.000 I will be able to make a book with approximately 150 images of hāfu from various backgrounds;

For € 70.000 I will be able to make a book with approximately 180 images of hāfu from various backgrounds.

••• Press coverage •••


Hāfu2Hāfu has been covered by some influential national and international media, including: 


the New York Times: ""If you gaze at the many portraits of half-Japanese, you can see the searching in their faces, the puzzling out. But you can also gain the sense that there are deep currents, forces old and powerful, in opposition to wall-building and racial hunkering."" - 11 March 2017

Japan Today: ""Interviews often elicit mixes of joy, pain and the mutual laughter of two people relating. Yet, an online viewer gets just a glimpse of these sessions."" (read interview here) - 25 Oct 2017

the Japan Times: ""“Both those raised abroad and those raised in Japan want to ‘belong’ to Japan more than most of them do. But this is more ‘painful’ when one is living in Japan."" (read interview here) - 8 Oct 2017




 
••• Presentations •••
In June 2017, I was invited to present Hāfu2Hāfu at Pecha Kucha Tokyo. Pecha Kucha is an international platform for creative and meaningful projects, presented according to a fixed format of 20 slides and 20 seconds per slide. You can view the presentation here. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 And here's the text in Japanese •••••「ハーフ」、つまり「日本人とのハーフであること」とは一体何でしょうか。それが私たちハーフのアイデンティティにどんな風に影響しているのでしょうか。•••••ベルギー人と日本人の両親を持つ私は、物心ついたときから自分のことを「ハーフ」と呼んできました。確かに多文化的な私の生い立ちは財産になりましたが、しかし一方でそれを嫌ってもいました。私は「ただのベルギー人」、でなければ「ただの日本人」になりたかったのです。去年、娘のユナが生まれてすぐに、私は自分の経験を他のハーフの人たちと比べてみることにしました。これがきっかけとなり、「ハーフである」とはどういうことなのかを探る撮影企画としてハーフ2(トゥ)ハーフ・プロジェクトを立ち上げました。私が他のハーフたちと話し、ポートレート写真を撮り、彼らだからこそ発せられる問いかけをあなたに届けることで、あなたとハーフの間にアイデンティティについての対話を生み出し、自分の心の内を観察してみるきっかけを作れればと考えています。そしてそのポートレート写真と問いかけを、日本人を親に持つハーフと、彼らの家族や友人、同僚やクラスメイトとの間の橋渡しにしたいと考えています。あるハーフからは、「子供の頃に文化の違いが引き起こした出来事を両親と話し合うために、このプロジェクトの問いかけを使いました。」という声が寄せられています。個人的な企画として始まったハーフ2ハーフ・プロジェクトは、そのスタートからは想像もできないほど大きく育ち、今もより多くの人に届いています。日本と「他の」65カ国との間に生まれたハーフ90人のポートレート写真と問いかけが、世界中の、日本人を親に持つハーフやその周囲を結びつけ、一つのコミュニティが生まれています。またプロジェクトは国際メディアで取り上げられ、現在までにプレゼンテーションやワークショップの依頼を複数頂きました。•••••私はあなたのご支援を通じて、それぞれ異なる国にルーツを持つより多くのハーフに会い、彼らのポートレート写真と問いかけを一冊の写真集にまとめたいと考えています。••••• ••••• ハーフとは •••••「ハーフ」とは、国籍や人種が異なる両親を持つ人に対して使われる日本語です。英語の half （半分）からきており、半分は外国人、半分は日本人という事を示しています。日本のハーフの間では自己紹介で最もよく使われる言葉ですが、差別語と感じる人もいる事は知っておくべきでしょう。そういった言葉の使い方は、このプロジェクトの重要なテーマのひとつになっています。 ••••• プロジェクトの進め方 •••••「ポートレート写真はカメラの中ではなく、その前と後ろの両側で製作される」　－エドワード・スタイケン参加してくれる方のポートレート写真を撮る前に、ハーフであることの色々な側面についてオープンかつプライベートな会話をするところから始めます。ハーフで有利なこと、不利なこと、私たちはどこに帰属しているか、どこに帰属していたいか、などなど。撮影前のこの会話を通じて、参加者の中で他のハーフへの問いかけが突き詰められていきます。Hāfu2Hāfu、「ハーフからハーフに」というこのプロジェクト名の由来はここにあります。写真撮影：Victoria Vlisides ••••• ハーフの多様性 •••••色々な国籍と日本人の組合せによる様々なハーフの方と会い、話をする事が重要です。ハーフとしてどのような体験をしてきたのかは、どの国とのハーフかによって恐らく最も大きく左右されるからです。そのため日本人と他の全ての国籍の組合せを網羅し、少なくともそれぞれ１枚のポートレート写真と問いかけを収録することを最終ゴールとしています。国連加盟国は193ヶ国あるため、日本人との組み合わせは192通りあることになります。国籍の他にも、ハーフとしてのアイデンティティーに影響を与える他の多様性もカバーしたいと思います。例えば出生地や教育、年齢、性別、両親の婚姻状態、宗教、きょうだい、日本語やその他言語の語学力、性的嗜好等です。現在までに、全ての大陸の65ヶ国以上との組合せで、90人以上の多種多様なハーフと会って話し、ポートレート写真を撮影してきました。 ••••• プロジェクトウェブサイト •••••Hāfu2Hāfu.org　では全てのポートレート写真をご覧いただけるとともに、プロジェクトに参加したハーフの問いかけに対して、閲覧者から回答する事もできます。参加していないハーフの方々、その家族や友人、ハーフでない方も、自分の経験をサイト上で共有頂けます。現在までに、世界中から500以上の反響を頂いています。 ••••• 写真集の事前注文について •••••全てのポートレート写真や問いかけを、美しい装丁の写真集にまとめられたらどんなに素晴らしいことでしょうか。プロジェクトの次のステップとして、皆さまのご支援を頂き実現したいと強く思っています。写真集には、多種多様な国籍やプロフィールを持つ少なくとも120人のハーフのポートレート写真と問いかけを収める予定です。実際に何人になるかは、今回の募金達成額にかかっています。写真集はこのプロジェクトの完了後、2019年半ばまでに出版、発送する予定です。最終的なフォーマットや仕上がりは、今後決めていきます。こちらはサンプル版です。最終版とは異なります。 ••••• 特別限定版の事前注文 •••••
掲載写真の１枚ずつを高画質プリントとして表紙にあしらった、特別限定版を発行します。
特別限定版の出版数は、写真集に掲載されているポートレート写真の数だけとなります。

<i>FERRET UPDATE:  28 July The Ferret published its first stories over the last week, after exceeding the crowdfunding target for its first investigation. Thank you!

<p><i>There are now <b>LESS THAN TWO WEEKS</b> left, and with extra funds raised we can promise to investigate further areas, which could potentially include challenges faced by people seeking asylum, NHS cuts or the justice system in Scotland. </i></p>
<p><i>One hundred and sixty people have already supported us (find out <a href=""https://theferret.scot/first-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">who some of them are</a>) to investigate fracking after the issue topped our public vote last month, taking 37 per cent of ballots cast.</i></p>
<p><i>The underseas coal gasification article is not part of the fracking package we have promised backers, but a bonus story.</i></p>
<p><i>Billy Briggs, one of The Ferret’s founders, said: “We are extremely grateful to everyone who has backed The Ferret and delighted to have raised over £5000. The more money we raise, the more issues we can investigate. We hope people will continue to donate to our crowdfunding campaign. The team at The Ferret is excited about the future and we are working hard on your behalf to hold power to account. We are already nosing up the trousers of power.”</i></p>
<p><i>The launch of The Ferret prompted much media interest and led to a number of articles being published.

<p><i>Please stay tuned, help spread the word and we look forward to ferreting hard on your behalf.</i></p>We need your help to investigate the stories that matter - like fracking. 

<p>Investigative journalism is suffering in
Scotland. The advertising revenues that have traditionally funded journalists
to uncover scandals are being swept away in the whirlwind of the Internet revolution.
We believe that something must be done. In a democracy like ours, few things
are more important than a free, fair and independent media, holding the
powerful to account. Without serious, fact-based journalism in pursuit of the
public interest and beholden to no-one, Scotland would be a darker place. <br/></p>
<p><b>Why The Ferret?</b><br/></p>
<p>That is why a group of highly experienced
journalists have founded <a href=""https://theferret.scot/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Ferret</a>, Scotland’s first investigative
journalism platform. The Ferret will not be owned by some distant corporation:
it will be owned by its members and run as a not-for-profit cooperative. The
Ferret will not be aligned with any political party or any vested interest. The Ferret will be both challenging
and irreverent, taking its stories seriously without taking itself too seriously. <b>We
want to nose up the trousers of power, on your behalf.</b></p>

<p><b>How will the money be used?</b></p>
<p>Your investment will fund an investigation

account for <b>every penny</b> by publishing details of all costs and payments on our

<p><b>If the public is generous enough to support

<p><b>Why a not-for-profit cooperative?</b></p>
<p>Most of the news media in the UK is owned by

accountable to you, our readers, ensuring that we always report in your
interests. </p>
<p>And because we are a cooperative, all profits will be

</div></div>","FERRET UPDATE 3 August: Thanks to everyone who has supported us with The Ferret so far – the curious, the creative and the compassionate. Your tremendous backing for the vision of democratic journalism that we’ve laid out, and for the headline-grabbing stories we’ve published so far, means that we’re off to a great start.Having reached far past our original crowdfunding target, and with less than a week to go until the crowdfund closes on 9 August, we are currently looking into fracking in Scotland. However, with additional money raised we plan to look into the hardships and injustices faced by people who seek refuge in Scotland and the wider UK – so we are now aiming for £7,600 – double our original target.
This would allow us to do a full investigation package on this topic, with a similar budget to our fracking package. All money spent will be made fully transparent to the public.


If you’d like to support our campaign in its last week financially we’d be most grateful. We’d also really appreciate it if you could help spread the word on social media – if you don’t like making up your own tweets/posts we could suggest something like “LAST CHANCE: Support@FerretScot to investigate plight of people seeking sanctuary in the UK https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-ferret-s-first-investigation-fracking/x/11158527#/story#DemocraticJournalism”
We also plan to announce a celebratory meet-up soon, where we can meet to discuss what’s been achieved so far and build the wider Ferret community – we hope that some of you will come down. We will confirm the details shortly.
Thanks and thanks again!
The Ferret Team
FERRET UPDATE:  28 July The Ferret published its first stories over the last week, after exceeding the crowdfunding target for its first investigation. Thank you! Currently, donations are over £5600, almost £2000 more than the amount we asked for to complete our first investigation, into fracking.


Our first exclusive stories have included uncovering a secret police report on the state of Scotland's CCTV system and revealing attempts by oil tycoon Algy Cluff to pressurise the Scottish government to allow undersea coal gasification, a technique SNP MP Tommy Sheppard told us was ""more problematic than fracking"".

There are now LESS THAN TWO WEEKS left, and with extra funds raised we can promise to investigate further areas, which could potentially include challenges faced by people seeking asylum, NHS cuts or the justice system in Scotland. 
One hundred and sixty people have already supported us (find out who some of them are) to investigate fracking after the issue topped our public vote last month, taking 37 per cent of ballots cast.
The underseas coal gasification article is not part of the fracking package we have promised backers, but a bonus story.
Billy Briggs, one of The Ferret’s founders, said: “We are extremely grateful to everyone who has backed The Ferret and delighted to have raised over £5000. The more money we raise, the more issues we can investigate. We hope people will continue to donate to our crowdfunding campaign. The team at The Ferret is excited about the future and we are working hard on your behalf to hold power to account. We are already nosing up the trousers of power.”
The launch of The Ferret prompted much media interest and led to a number of articles being published. They included reports by The Guardian, the Press Gazette, journalism.co.uk, the Global Investigative Journalism Network, Through The Cracks and the Pakistan Telegraph, as well as much social media interest.
The Ferret’s Peter Geoghegan was interviewed by BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland and STV’s Scotland Tonight, and Rob Edwards has been on BBC Good Morning Scotland to talk about the Ferret's first stories.
Please stay tuned, help spread the word and we look forward to ferreting hard on your behalf.We need your help to investigate the stories that matter - like fracking. 

Investigative journalism is suffering in
Scotland. The advertising revenues that have traditionally funded journalists
to uncover scandals are being swept away in the whirlwind of the Internet revolution.
We believe that something must be done. In a democracy like ours, few things
are more important than a free, fair and independent media, holding the
powerful to account. Without serious, fact-based journalism in pursuit of the
public interest and beholden to no-one, Scotland would be a darker place. 
Why The Ferret?
That is why a group of highly experienced
journalists have founded The Ferret, Scotland’s first investigative
journalism platform. The Ferret will not be owned by some distant corporation:
it will be owned by its members and run as a not-for-profit cooperative. The
Ferret will not be aligned with any political party or any vested interest. The Ferret will be both challenging
and irreverent, taking its stories seriously without taking itself too seriously. We
want to nose up the trousers of power, on your behalf.
Who’s involved?
The team at The Ferret comprises of journalists Billy Briggs, Rob Edwards, Peter Geoghegan, and Rachel Hamada, as well as designer Jo Skinner. (Find out more about the Ferret team. Samples of some of our recent stories are on our front page.) We also have some great supporters, such as photographers Simon Murphy and Angela Catlin; journalists Mei-Ling McNamara, Tom Allan and David Eyre; James Mackenzie and Edd McCracken. 
What they're saying about us:
Irvine Welsh, Author - ""Democracy thrives in the light, and part of the reason it has become so sick in the west, is that the mainstream media with its wealthy proprietors now act solely as mouthpieces for the interests of an international elite. Such people are seen as beyond reproach or investigation, while, paradoxically, the activities of ordinary citizens become more and more proscribed. A fledgling, emergent democracy like Scotland needs to develop the highest standards of investigative journalism to protect and nurture itself.""
Karine Polwart, singer and songwriter - ""Collectively we can't take responsibility for governing ourselves in a just and sustainable manner if we're unaware of the stories, the science, the values and vested interests that underpin what's happening in the world we inhabit. The kind of in depth independent investigative journalism that The Ferret promises has never been more essential. And it's ours to own and support together.""
Iain Macwhirter, political columnist for The Herald and the Sunday Herald - ""The Ferret is just what Scottish journalism needs: independent, investigative, intelligent - and up the trouser leg of the establishment.""

Paul Wood , Managing Director, West Highland Publishing Company Limited - ""We need more independent media asking the questions the powerful don't want to answer. We need that media to be independent and we need it to thrive. All at the West Highland Free Press wish The Ferret every success; it's vital they succeed.""

Nicole Kleeman, Executive Producer, Firecrest Films - ""Scotland is crying out for a dedicated outlet investigating what is really going on, without political slant or pressure to hit sales targets and viewing figures.""
Please help fund our first investigation.
The Ferret will listen to and involve its
readers. You have already helped us choose our first investigation, which will be into FRACKING, after it
topped our recent public poll with 37 per cent of the vote. 
Why is fracking important? 
Well, the Scottish Government has announced
a temporary moratorium on onshore gas exploitation, including fracking for
underground shale gas and drilling for coalbed methane. The public are to be
consulted and safety is to be studied but what does this really mean? What
deals are being done behind the scenes to protect the vested interests of

Your investment will fund an investigation

If the public is generous enough to support
us beyond this target, you will allow us to explore other subjects, for example
the challenges faced by people seeking
asylum in Scotland; cuts to the NHS, which also proved popular in our
public vote; or any other timely stories that need investigating.

Why a not-for-profit cooperative?

<p><strong>Afganistan’a gidiyorum…</strong></p>
<p>Ben Mahmut. Magma Dergisi, Seferihisar Doğa Okulu ve Doğa Derneği fotoğrafçısıyım. Marmara Üniversitesi’nde Fotoğraf Bölümü’nde okudum. Yaklaşık 10 yıldır fotoğraf çekiyorum. Başta Anadolu olmak üzere doğa ve doğa kültürü üzerine belgesel fotoğraf projeleri üretiyorum. Daha önce göçebe topluluklardan Sarıkeçililer ile 35 gün boyunca Mersin’den Konya’ya kadar Toroslar üzerinden göçtüm ve yaşayışlarını fotoğrafladım. Kuzey Afganistan’dan göçen Türkistanlılarla, Antakya Ovakent’te 25 gün boyunca yaşadım, fotoğraf çektim.</p>
<p>Türkiye’deki tecrübemden sonra farklı coğrafyalarda yaşayan göçebelerin yaşamlarına dahil olmak istiyorum. Kültürlerini, hayatı ve doğayı algılayış biçimlerini anlamak ve paylaşmak benim için çok önemli. Zamanın ve mesafelerin saatler değil günler üzerinden dillendirildiği, yolculukların at sırtında en az 4-5 gün sürdüğü bir coğrafyada yaşamak nasıldır? Zamanın olmadığı, paranın geçmediği bir topluğun hayata bakış açısı nedir? Merak ediyorum.  </p>
<p>Bugün yaşadığımızdan oldukça farklı bir bölgeye ve zorlu koşullara yapacağım yolculuğu gerçekleştirmek için çeşitli malzemeler ve teknik ekipmanlara ihtiyacım var. Destekleriniz öncelikle bu malzemeleri edinmem ve yolculuğu gerçekleştirmem için çok önemli. Hedefime ulaşabilmem durumunda yolculuk sırasında çektiğim fotoğraflardan ve yazılardan oluşan bir kitap yayınlamayı düşünüyorum. Yayınevleri konusunda araştırmaya başladım bile. Hedefime ulaşmam için katkı koyanlardan bazılarına imzalı kitabımı göndereceğim.</p>
<p><strong>Pamir Dağları’nın 5000 metresinde nasıl bir yaşam var?</strong></p>
<p>Afganistan'ın kuzeydoğusunda, 5000 metrelik irtifa yüzünden tarım yapılamayan, tek besin ve geçim kaynağının yaklar (Tibet sığırı) olduğu bir bölgede yaşamın nasıl şekillendiğini merak ediyorum. Bir dönem İpek Yolu’nun en gözde noktalarından birisi olan Wakhan Koridoru şu an medeniyetin en ücra köşesinde bulunan göçebe toplulukların yaşadığı yer. Bölgede yaşayan iki topluluğun göç sırasında durakladıkları yere bir yolculuk yapacağım. Wakhiler ve Kırgızlar arasında para geçmiyor, tüm alışveriş takas yöntemiyle oluyor. Üretim bu toplulukta paradan daha kıymetli, çünkü hayatta kalmak için paraya değil bu ürünlere ihtiyaçları var.</p>
<p><strong>Wakhan Koridoru’na nasıl ulaşılır?</strong></p>
<p>Nisan’da İzmir’den yola çıkacağım. Kabil’e ulaştıktan sonra Wakhan Koridoru'na 3-4 gün süren bir araba yolculuğu yapacağım. Wakhan Koridoru'ndan Pamir Dağları'nın 5000 metre yüksekliğine yaklaşık 5 gün at üzerinde gideceğim ve Wakhilerin ve Kırgızların yaşadıkları bölgeye ulaşacağım.</p>
<p><strong>Peki bu yolculuk tehlikeli değil mi?</strong></p>
<p>Yolculuğun güzergahı sebebiyle çeşitli zamanlarda IŞID ve Taliban tehdidinin yaşandığı bölgelerden geçeceğim. Özbek kökenli olduğum için Kuzey Afganistan’daki insanlara benziyorum. Gider gitmez edineceğim yerel kıyafetlerle bölgede sorunsuz yolculuk yapabileceğimi düşünüyorum. Şimdiden sakallarımı uzatmaya başladım.</p>
<p><strong>Peki Afganistan’da yolumu nasıl bulacağım? </strong></p>
<p>Afganistan’da savaş nedeniyle öksüz kalan çocukları okutan bir dernek ile iletişim halindeyim. Dernek başkanı Mehrab bana bu yolculuğumda eşlik edecek. Öğrencilerinden o bölgede yaşayan çocuklar sayesinde yolculuğuma dair tüm detayları önceden çözebiliyorum. Hatta Wakhan Koridoru’na ve sonrasında Wakhilerin yaşadığı bölgeye birlikte yolculuk yapacağımız atı şimdiden ayarlamaya çalışıyoruz! Van’ın Ulupamir isimli bir Kırgız Köyü’nde, Wakhanlı bir Kırgız göçebesinden yolculuk hakkında detaylı bilgi aldım.</p>
<p><strong>Yolculuk için nelere ihtiyacım var?</strong></p>
<p>Bu özel coğrafyaya yapmayı planladığım seyahati gerçekleştirmek benim için çok önemli. Yolculuk için gerekli malzemeler ve teknik ekipmanlar için 1500 dolara ihtiyacım var. Dönüşümde bunu bir kitaba dönüştürmek ve öğrendiklerimi, anladıklarımı, yaşadıklarımı paylaşmak ise en büyük hayalim. Kitabın tasarım ve baskı giderleri için de 2000 dolar gerekli. Yeterli miktarı tamamlayamadığım durumda elimden geleni yapacağım ve bu yolculuğu gerçekleştireceğim.</p>
<p>Bu hayale destek olursanız çok sevinirim. Bağış yapamasanız da çevrenizle paylaşmanız, etrafınızı haberdar etmeniz, kampanyamı paylaşmanız da büyük bir katkı sağlayacaktır.</p>

The constant and eternal flux of flowing of water, especially when subjected to the forces of nature, is an arousing phenomena.  How does something that moves vigorously and gracefully change so 
easily and become rigid and razor sharp? Everything changes.There is something about water, that fascinates me. Perhaps it is its beauty and gracefulness that is so alluring. Perhaps it was the terrifying experience of drowning as a child that has forever haunted me.

Thanks so much for reading! 
</div></div>","You're invited to be a part of
producing INSTRUMENTHEAD -- a fine art hardcover book that presents musicians
in a way you've never seen before.


Exhibiting my INSTRUMENTHEAD
portraits has been a dream come true. I've collaborated with hundreds
of artists, capturing the inseparable connection to their
instrument and craft. Through this process I have been able to find my voice as
an artist. I am often asked if there is a book of my work that is available for
purchase. With your help, I hope to publish a full-color fine art book
called INSTRUMENTHEAD.      (Wavy Gravy - hippie icon)Music is My Passion; Photography is My MediumI began calling people who were known for the instrument they played (as well as for their look and style). I asked, “How are we going to tell your story? How will people know that it is you, without seeing your face? What is it about you that makes you special?” The photo shoots became a collaborative exchange between the musicians and myself.              (Michael and Bootsy, Instrumenthead shoot, 2010)Unsung Sidemen and World Music RepresentedMany of the musicians that I have photographed are “sidemen.” I have also photographed many people from various countries who play indigenous instruments and wear traditional clothes from their homeland.   (Pride Chigwedere, Pedrito Martinez, and Zakir Hussain, 2010-2011)Musicians PhotographedTo date, over 400 musicians have been photographed for this project by setting up mobile studios all over, from backyards to music venues.       (Pop-up studio, Chicago, 2010)Portraits for INSTRUMENTHEAD have been taken all over the United States, as well as in Barcelona, Cape Town, and Rotterdam.    (Pop-up studio, Preservation Hall, New Orleans, 2010)Just a Few of the Musicians Photographed for INSTRUMENTHEAD:
Bootsy Collins (James Brown, Parliament Funkadelic, Bootsy's Rubberband)Johnny Winter (Solo Artist)Matisyahu (Solo Artist)Dave Schools (Widespread Panic)Mickey Hart (Grateful Dead)Jon Popper (Blues Traveler)Kenny Olson (Kid Rock)Derek Trucks (Allman Brother Band, Tedeschi Trucks Band)Zakir Hussain (Shakti, Masters of Percussion)Junior Brown (Solo Artist)John Forte (The Fugees)Kyle Hollingsworth (String Cheese Incident)Pepper Keenan (Corrosion of Conformity, Down)Lenny White (Return to Forever, Miles Davis)Pedrito Martinez (Solo Artist)Matt Abts (Gov't Mule)Mark Guilianan (Beat Music, Brad Meldau)Peter Keys (Lynard Skynard)Sam Bush (Solo Artist)Alto Reed (Bob Seger and The Silver Bullet Band)Futureman (Bela Fleck and the Flecktones)Jimmy Johnson and David Hood (The Swampers)…and so many more! (You can see more musicians at Michael's website.)INSTRUMENTHEAD ExhibitionsA few years ago, I had the opportunity to showcase my work on a grand scale. With the help of friends and
colleagues I was able to transform a 50,000-square foot warehouse into a
large-scale sensory experience that was free to the public. It went on for two
weeks during Jazz Fest displaying 75 four-foot-tall photographs. Musicians,
painters, and aerial artists were performing every day. Since the New Orleans show, I have created various pop-up exhibits inside the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, The Lockn’ Festival in Virginia, the Piccolo Spoleto Festival in Charleston, the Muscle Shoals Music Association Holiday Party, Oz, a contemporary art center, in Nashville, The Country Music Hall of Fame, The NorthSea Jazz Festival, and The Big Blues Bender in Las Vegas. Once INSTRUMENTHEAD is published, I will have books for sale at future gallery shows, music festivals, and on my website.(TNT show, Oz Arts Nashville, 2010)INSTRUMENTHEAD book scheduleThe design and production of a fine art book is a long and expensive process. We are aiming to deliver the book to IndieGoGo backers ahead of schedule, and we are projecting OCTOBER 2016 for delivery date.What We Need and What You Will Receive:
With your help, our goal is 
to have an initial print run of 2,500 books. If we do not reach our 
goal, we will deliver the same quality final product to our 
contributors. If we exceed our goal, we will be able to expand the book 
by 48 more pages! I'm also giving a portion to some important charities -
 read on for more information!

We have reached out to printers to 
review samples and quotes. Now all we need is you! October 2016 is when 
we expect the INSTRUMENTHEAD (book) to ship out to IndieGoGo backers. 

All
 other perks, such as limited edition prints, postcards, lithographs, 
and show posters are available now, and will ship in December 2015. 


The Impact

With this IndieGoGo campaign I will be able to produce and publish INSTRUMENTHEAD. During the years I've worked with a number of great charities that have helped me and I have in turn have benefitted them through my exhibitions. With this campaign, 5% of the total amount that I receive will be distributed to the following 4 charities:

Tipitinas Foundation
Music Maker Foundation
New Orleans Musicians Assistance Foundation (NOMAF)
Rock the Earth

                                                     

                                     

                                                


        


Challenges and Moving Forward




I have put together a great team, and we've prepared as much as possible
 to make sure that this project runs smoothly. From this campaign, 
through the book design and production, to shipping out orders, we know 
what our next steps are and what deadlines we have to meet. The 
INSTRUMENTHEAD community has grown so fast that we know this is a book 
people want, and we've done the research to make this a success.

We do not have an advertising budget, so we're relying on grassroots word-of-mouth. Please tell your friends to visit and share Instrumentheadbook.com.

<h3>Brief History</h3>
<p>Let me introduce myself, Jonathan Young, and the “United
Skateboard Photography Project” to you. 
</p>
<p>I’ve been a skateboarder since the age of 4, I’m 42 years old
today and I skate bowls, vert, mini ramp and street as often as I can
still. In December 2012, I left the security of a full-time job to dedicate my time and energy to pushing the <a href=""http://www.unitedskateboardingpp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">United Skateboard Photography Project</a>.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/440739/files/20140317153931-me-vertattack-2014.jpg?1395095971"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Photo: Fred Ferand - Skater: me, Jonathan Young at this year's Vert Attack 8 in Malmö, Sweden<br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>Skateboard photography, the photographers and the skaters have
accompanied my experience with skateboarding for practically all of
my life. 
</p>
<p>In December 2012 I decided that I would like to create a website
and a book dedicated to skateboard photography and the photographers
to present their work to a worldwide audience. At the same time I
wanted to combine this effort with a donation from the sales of the

Mike Rogers, after his second battle with sarcoma cancer. Mike's
tumor was located behind his right eye and nasal cavity. He endured a
17 hour surgery a cranial-facial resection with a brain-lift, removal
of his eye, cheekbone, and half of the roof of his mouth and some of

later. Mike beat the odds and is a competitive skateboarder
again.</p><p></p><p>The mission of the Grind For Life organization is to provide
financial assistance to cancer patients and their families when
traveling long distances to doctors and hospitals. In addition, they
educate and inspire these patients and families concerning cancer
survival and recovery. Those who qualify may request assistance for
travel and lodging expenses, meal, and personal needs. <br/><br/>Their
ultimate goal with the organization is to have a couple of apartments
near Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in Manhattan, so people who
are receiving treatment at the hospital can have their family near
them. They want to be able to provide a comfortable place to stay,
charge fees based on a sliding scale, provide support for those who
are not accustomed to the city, and make a rough situation a little
easier for those who travel long distances for treatment.</p><p>

</li>
</ul><p>Initial funds through this campaign will be used to pay the fees
for the fundraising through Indiegogo (4%), the print and shipment of the book in Hongkong, and the shipment of the book to early contributors
and the skateboard photographers featured in the book. <br/></p><p>Any extra
funds raised will go to supporting the Grind For Life organization,

Brief History
Let me introduce myself, Jonathan Young, and the “United
Skateboard Photography Project” to you. 

I’ve been a skateboarder since the age of 4, I’m 42 years old
today and I skate bowls, vert, mini ramp and street as often as I can
still. In December 2012, I left the security of a full-time job to dedicate my time and energy to pushing the United Skateboard Photography Project.Photo: Fred Ferand - Skater: me, Jonathan Young at this year's Vert Attack 8 in Malmö, Sweden
Skateboard photography, the photographers and the skaters have
accompanied my experience with skateboarding for practically all of
my life. 

In December 2012 I decided that I would like to create a website
and a book dedicated to skateboard photography and the photographers
to present their work to a worldwide audience. At the same time I
wanted to combine this effort with a donation from the sales of the
book for a charity that works with skateboarders – now 100% of the book
revenue from the book sales after German taxes (I live in Hamburg, Germany) will go directly to the Grind For Life charity foundation.
Charitable Cause I'm Supporting
Grind For Life, Inc was founded in 2003, by life-long skateboarder
Mike Rogers, after his second battle with sarcoma cancer. Mike's
tumor was located behind his right eye and nasal cavity. He endured a
17 hour surgery a cranial-facial resection with a brain-lift, removal
of his eye, cheekbone, and half of the roof of his mouth and some of
his teeth. He beat cancer once as a pre-teen, and again 25 years
later. Mike beat the odds and is a competitive skateboarder
again.The mission of the Grind For Life organization is to provide
financial assistance to cancer patients and their families when
traveling long distances to doctors and hospitals. In addition, they
educate and inspire these patients and families concerning cancer
survival and recovery. Those who qualify may request assistance for
travel and lodging expenses, meal, and personal needs. Their
ultimate goal with the organization is to have a couple of apartments
near Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in Manhattan, so people who
are receiving treatment at the hospital can have their family near
them. They want to be able to provide a comfortable place to stay,
charge fees based on a sliding scale, provide support for those who
are not accustomed to the city, and make a rough situation a little
easier for those who travel long distances for treatment.

What The Project Needs 

I'm doing this fundraising campaign because the project needs to raise the
funds for the publication, shipment, marketing of the
printed book and to be able to give the campaign supporters (that's you hopefully!) something back for your donation. I also have chosen to work with a  professional publisher ( Everbest Printing Co Ltd in Hongkong) who

I will print (at least) 1000 copies of the book


Each copy of the book will be hardcover 11.8"" x 11.8""

Paper being used is 157 gsm matt artpaper China SPCo matt

Initial funds through this campaign will be used to pay the fees
for the fundraising through Indiegogo (4%), the print and shipment of the book in Hongkong, and the shipment of the book to early contributors
and the skateboard photographers featured in the book. Any extra
funds raised will go to supporting the Grind For Life organization,
the skateboard photographers involved in the project and to continue work on the dedicated United Skateboard Photography Project website to create new projects in the future supporting non-profit organizations. Photographer: Fred Ferand / Skater: Steve Caballero

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My work is based on fifteen years of travel and street photography coupled with digital manipulation.  This series, the Universe in Us, includes travel and street photos digitally composited with astronomy, biology and other science images.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have a rich archive of travel and street photos to mine, but I need some better tools (computer, storage, printer, etc.) and funds to create high resolution prints and other items I can display in local art events and offer for sale.  </p>
<p>My hope is to also teach others to create art this way, and to learn to express freely and build sustainable income streams for themselves.</p>
<p>I'd also like to create videos, mixed media installations, and various other transmedia permutations of these themes.  I also write, and may incorporate the photos into books and other permutations.  Maybe even jewelry and clothing!</p>
<p>In exchange for your support, I will offer transformations of your favorite photos, or even make videos that spread your message.</p>

<h3>Shoot Film UK</h3>
<p>An analogue community built for you, by you. Shoot Film UK have been promoting film based photographers from around the world to an international audience since 2016, free of charge and with the artists best interests at heart. Our goal is to continue supporting artists for many more years and we can safely say we've enjoyed it this far! </p>
<p>In order to continue running the site you will know there are the occasional fees that are required to maintain the site including web hosting and domain charges. </p>
<p>Although this campaign is based around pitching for funds to keep the site live and continue promoting film photographers through our open calls and artist features we thought this would be a pretty good time to talk about future ShootFilmUK plans.</p>
<p>So initially, what are we looking for?</p>
<ul>
<li>Funds to pay for the website, to keep it live and continue sharing amazing work from the ever growing community of people who have contributed to ShootFilmUK and followed us.</li>
<li>Funds to cover the domain name <a href=""http://www.ShootFilm.UK"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ShootFilm.UK</a> so that everyone who has linked to their featured work on the site wont lose out and people will still be able to reach us.</li>
</ul>
<p>But as we mentioned, that's not all... If we reach our target, GREAT! However depending on the results of this IndieGoGo campaign we want to invest more into our artists.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Supporting ShootFilmUK</h3>
<p>Funding a campaign like this is fantastic, it means a lot to the people requesting your support, but what about if we can spread that love further?</p>
<p>Here's our plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we are able to reach our target the site will stay live, everyone will be happy and we can continue to publish and promote artists working with film.</li>
<li>If we exceed our target, we will be investing those funds back into ShootFilmUK in certain ways depending on how much we are able to raise.</li>
<li>For every 10euros over our target we will be sending a roll of film out to one of our contributing artists selected at random, so whilst your support helps the ShootFilmUK site stay active, you'll also be supporting the work of a film photographer, be it a student, a hobbyist or a professional!</li>
<li>Where will any extra money go? Well as we begin 2018 our plans to expand are always getting closer! Any money will go towards the printing costs of our first issues of ShootFilmUK Zines. Depending on how much we are able to raise we hope to have prints by the summer time. If however we are unable to raise enough to cover those costs we will put them back into the site through our 'My 24exp Project' and other contributor focused projects.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By donating to this campaign you are not only helping ShootFilmUK maintain web-presence, you will be helping promote the work of hundreds of artists from around the world. </p>
<p>Funds raised will help keep the site up to date and go towards future projects, all to continue building an already successful and strong community of analogue artists working in all areas and all formats of film photography.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Donating</h3>
<p>As we are not asking for thousands of euros to release a product or start a business we are simply asking for people interested to donate as little or as much as possible to keep the site alive and as mentioned, anything extra will be passed on by supporting artists around the world with materials they need in order to produce new work.</p>
<p>Because of this we will be offering all who donate just a little something in return to say thank you for their generosity. This will be done in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>All contributors will be mentioned on the website in a dedicated list of ShootFilmUK supporters.</li>
<li>All contributors will receive a special ShootFilmUK postcard, hand signed to say thank you.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. If you're unable to support us with a donation but wish to keep the site live there are other ways you can help support the campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish the campaign on your blog, instagram, tweet about it and help us spread the word!</li>
<li>Use the share tools to get the correct links you need.</li>
<li>Share it with your friends and family on facebook.</li>
<li>Print out black and white screenshots of the campaign page and tape them on all the lamp posts as you walk to work in the morning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any support you are able to offer is greatly appreciated and the hundreds of artists you are helping support will all agree that without the kind support you have offered, none of this would be possible.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi! I'm Jules, the founder and creator of Why We Ink. What started as an online forum for tattooed cancer survivors and those tattooed in memory of loved ones has now turned into something much bigger… something global.</p>
<p>Following a flood of viral media attention, an outpour of public interest and celebrity support, Why We Ink will now be made into a large format photographic coffee table book. The book will share inspiring stories of both triumph and loss, and feature beautiful imagery of cancer related tattoos, with all proceeds going to cancer care support groups.</p>
<p>As many who have endured the cancer journey know, there are so many groups that aid in the day-to-day support a cancer patient requires. Services like driving to and from Chemo/Radiation appointments, wig donations and in-home care are so crucial to the daily quality of life a cancer patient experiences. Raising money for cancer research will always be an integral component to fighting this terrible disease, but while we strive for a cure, there is still so much we can do to enrich the quality of life for those fighting <em>now.</em></p>
<p>I lost my brother Owen to cancer 3 years ago, and during his battle it was these programs that made our journey a little easier and provided the comfort of knowing we were not alone.</p>
<p>Standing behind the Why We Ink cause is an amazing group of photographers from across Canada and the US who are currently shooting our real life cancer survivors, and friends or family members who have lost a loved one to cancer.

I came to China in 2010 and I have worked for a couple of different schools over the past few years, finally settling in on a job here in Chongqing. Apart from my teaching I also do photography. I have had a camera attached to my hand since I spent a couple of months in Australia back in 2005.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As a personal challenge to myself and for, what I hope is, a nice gesture to this wonderful place that I live in, I have decided to start a kind of experimental photography project. I want to shoot and produce a photo book showcasing Chongqing as a beautiful city and province. Chongqing, is often covered in fog because it usually rains at night. As a result, the city, by the locals is often referred to as “Fog City” and as any major city in China, it battles with air pollution just like Beijing does, although not as severe. But even so, Chongqing, the city and munincipality is a beautiful place to live and visit, if you open your eyes and dare venture out.

I came to China in 2010 and I have worked for a couple of different schools over the past few years, finally settling in on a job here in Chongqing. Apart from my teaching I also do photography. I have had a camera attached to my hand since I spent a couple of months in Australia back in 2005.As a personal challenge to myself and for, what I hope is, a nice gesture to this wonderful place that I live in, I have decided to start a kind of experimental photography project. I want to shoot and produce a photo book showcasing Chongqing as a beautiful city and province. Chongqing, is often covered in fog because it usually rains at night. As a result, the city, by the locals is often referred to as “Fog City” and as any major city in China, it battles with air pollution just like Beijing does, although not as severe. But even so, Chongqing, the city and munincipality is a beautiful place to live and visit, if you open your eyes and dare venture out. And this, is what I would like to show in my project, and hopefully, in my book once it is finished.My project is a little special, because rather than me just going out and taking pictures all by myself, I want to try and create a small community around producing this photo book. I do have some pictures ready at this time, but I would like the community, people like you, to help me decide on locations, what pictures go into the final photo book and give ideas and feedback on layout.

Also, I have teamed up with local Chinese people who will take me around to special locations, some, away from the normal tourist routes.I am asking for funding here, to help cover the production cost of the photo book that I am going to produce at the end of the project The funds raised here, through your contributions, will go towards the initial copies that I will NEED to get started and getting people aware of my book after the project has concluded. The photo book is going to be called ""A Portrait of Chongqing"" and will be printed as an A4 Lay Flat photo book printed on high quality photo paper. It is going to look good, on YOUR coffee table and your friends are going to LOVE it as much as you are!More details on the book will follow as the project progesses.Here is my plan for the project as it moves forward over the coming year. I will post detailed updates on my project page as I move from preparation, into planning, shooting and post processing as well. You can find my project page herewww.mslarsen.dk/portraitofchongqingRight now, I am still in the Funding phase, which will run until this campaign finishes in March. After the campaign has finished, I will post further updates on how I will move on from there.Old cities like Gongtan in Chongqing province stand in sharp contrast to the modern development currently going on in  urban Chongqing. The city is growing fast and new, modern skyscrapers shoot up everywhere.For those who choose the prints only perks, the pictures will become available as I finish them, but all the pictures in the book will be online on my website at the time that the book is finished so you can select your favorite print around fall also in time for Christmas.At Jiefang bei, one of the more prominent shopping areas in Chongqing stands a monument of freedom, a big clock tower in the center of the square surrounded by named brand stores like Gucci, Armani, Prada and Emernegildo Zegna. Of course, some may not be able to contribute to help fund A Portrait of Chongqing but that does not mean you cannot help.

<p> I'm a native-born Canadian with a passion for photography digital art. I have always loved taking photos with a focus on flowers and insects.</p>
<p>The city in which I live has beautiful gardens that make a great photos to fill for magazines, websites, blogs, and stock photography. Currently, I only use my mobile phone to create these images with little photo editing, just raw talent. I'm hoping to upgrade my gear while also sharing some of my photos with my contributors. A phone camera is not cutting it for the kind of detail and beauty I wish to portray in the simple beauty of our world.</p>
<p>There is also an digital artist that has recently formed in me and would love to that have that grow. The program I use right now is good but it would be awesome to start using a program like Photoshop to really hone in and make artful creations from my photos. </p>
<p>As a thank you, I would like to offer some of my photos and even take some of your portraits and make them into one-of-a-kind creations!</p>

<h2>Cimetiere d'Ixelles</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Dave Smith</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Physicist by training, Educator by profession and Photographer by passion</strong></p>
<p>I have spent decades teaching myself the Photographic craft and developing the art of Photography! Yet this is my first Photographic book. Even this project has been some years in the making.</p>
<p>My approach to presenting my Photography has been changing over recent years and I have come to the belief that the Photobook is the best way to get as many people as possible to see my Photography. There is a permanence about the Photobook that doesn't exist in any other way.</p>
<p>This documenting of the Cimetiere d'Ixelles is my first Photobook and this has rather opened the floodgates and I am now shooting for the next three books. The key has been discovering 'the story' for each project, the narrative that drives the images and it is this which demands the Photobook approach - having a series of images to tell a self contained story through those images. The narrative through the story from the Cimetiere d'Ixelles is particularly strong and has some interesting sidelines as well as a sad twist in the tale.</p>
<p>It is easy to make a photobook and indeed I already have for the mock-up to introduce this campaign ... where contributors come in is to take this project one step further to allow the printing of a set of books for sale to interested collectors, to bring the story to life as it were, because an untold story is only a dream!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign seeks to raise 1500 eur</p>
<ul>
<li>The bulk of this money is to cover the printing costs of the book at around 870 eur.</li>
<li>The Indiegogo fee is 50 eur</li>
<li>Credit card fees are 50 eur</li>
<li>Bank fees are 25 eur</li>
<li>Costs to produce the incentives are 500 eur</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of 'perks' available to participants ranging from a simple thank you through to copies of the book itself as well as prints and other associated products ... check out the perks section to find out more.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am hoping that this first project of this kind for me will start a community of people interested in the imagery that I make and who want to support its further development. In particular, I am keen to see the resurgence of the Photobook which in its heyday of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was the method of choice for disseminating the Photographic Arts. It has rather fallen by the wayside with rising prices for printed matter in the latter part of the last century. However, the digital revolution has opened new doors and it is those that I am hoping to exploit. </p>
<p>The idea of the tightly curated Photobook around a very precise theme or narrative is an important change in the current method of producing photobooks, which has tended to more and more images, bigger and bigger size until it is unwieldy in its weight as well as its content - we simply cannot comfortably view the contents any more!</p>
<p>I am interested in the reintroduction of the 'fascicle' from the early days of the Photobook when they were sold in installments, to keep the size manageable and the cost reasonable!</p>
<p>I am intending a series of Photobooks which will build a community as well as an ongoing collection. This may well change the way that we buy and view the Photographic Arts!</p>
<p>I am currently shooting for the next three projects;</p>
<ul>
<li>the first of these is called ... <i><strong>pop. 600</strong></i> about a very small village with a surprisingly large commercial center! A sort of documentary through commerce project!</li>
<li>the second is ... <i><strong>same but different</strong></i> about the hunter's chairs that are everywhere here and obviously built to a specific brief but each with its nuances of difference. A sort allegory to the human condition!</li>
<li>the third is ... <i><strong>working with nature</strong></i> about the field sheds and how they are made to fit in with nature rather than fight against it!</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a fourth project in mind as well and many more to follow. But these should keep us busy for now. The aim for these projects is to tell the story through images and to keep that story tight and self contained so that the books never get too large, too costly or too unwieldy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I think that the only real risk to the success of this project is not reaching enough people who are interested in the project or the subject matter - and let's face it, images of a cemetery probably aren't everyone's cup of tea!</p>
<p>There are two ways to overcome this hurdle; firstly, I will be pushing my own communities online and offline very hard to try to get the project to as many people as possible. However, the second way to ensure success is for everyone interested in the project to do exactly the same, to push your online and offline communities hard to just look at the project. I am not suggesting any 'strong arm' tactics to get them to contribute, only to at least look they can then decide for themselves. Of course if everyone who looks helps at least by passing on the project to their communities then before we know it we will reach our targets and we will have built out own community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It may be that you are one of those not interested in the book or the images, but don't let that put you off. Firstly, even the smallest donations help ... remember that<i><strong> all big bits are made of little bits!</strong></i> But, if you simply do not want to make a contribution then that is absolutely fine ... in all honesty I am just glad that you came and looked. However, you may well know one or more people who would be interested</p>

<b>We love
streets. </b></p>
<p>“We go back
to some streets more often than others, not just because the things we have to
do are more centered on one street than another. We may choose to focus a part
of our lives on a street for reasons that are not necessarily economic or
functional. Maybe a particular street unlocks memories, or offers expectations
of something pleasant to be seen, or the possibility of an encounter. Because
some streets are more pleasant than others, we may go out of our way to be on
them, even on a trip to somewhere else.” Allan B. Jacobs, <i>Looking, learning, making</i>. </p>
<p>Reading the
likes of urbanists, and writers, like Allan Jacobs, Bernard Rudosfky, Jan Gehl,
Jane Jacobs, has changed the way we traditionally thought about
what a street really is. We want to show why streets are so important for our
cities, using the ideas of the people that know about them the best, the same
people which ideas helped to create the structure of a master’s degree urban
thesis for one of us in our team, and extending some of those ideas into a
photographic project: a book called, I love Tokyo streets.</p>
<p><b>Why is the
street important? </b></p>
<p>-Streets are
more than public utilities, more than linear physical spaces that permit people
and good to get from here to there (A.Jacobs). Streets are 80% of the usable
public space in our cities (<a href=""www.pps.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pps.org</a>) </p>
<p>-“The street
is where you go to see people, and to be seen by people” (A.Jacobs). The street is
where cities come to life, it’s also one of the most important physical spaces,
where identity and belonging to the city is born. </p>
<p>-We know the
city through knowing our streets. We know the streets where the people we love
live, we know the streets of the places we love to go. In a way of speaking, we
know what we love better, in more detail. Imagine if we could love our cities
more, and take more care about them, by improving our streets. </p>
<p>-Great streets are for everyone, if you have a car it’s ok, if you don’t it’s
ok. This is the place where we are all the same, where democracy truly exists,
and where we, together, can continue to grow and make our cities more
humanized. </p>
<p><b>Why Tokyo?</b></p>
<p>As of
recently, Tokyo has been named the most livable city on earth <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/17/worlds-best-city-to-live-tokyo_n_7603340.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>by
the monocle magazine</u></a>. The three of us feel this is the place to do this
project. Being a megalopolis this size, we find it similar in some numbers to

<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are Emmanuel, and José,
two architects from Mexico that met in the university nine years ago.
Nowadays, our bond has increased by some of the passions we share, like the
love for the city, and for photography. The two of us are pursuing a master’s
degree, two of us went on to learn about the city and how it works, and our
thesis are all about public space and the street.</p>
<p>As urbanists we had the opportunity
to attend the World Urban Forum 7 in Medellín, Colombia. It was astonishing to
see how a city can change so much and become one of the great examples in Latin
America in the way of city planning, especially after those violent
and sad decades, we have those problems too, in our country,
Mexico. In the end, it’s reassuring to know that there are solutions for
the city and its people. We believe some of those problems are solved in the
streets: safer streets, busy streets, make great cities, with more options,
more humanized ones too. </p>
<p>As photographers, we have been involved in different adventures, where we have learn more and more
about the discipline. The two of us like different style of photography, and besides that, we possess other different skills, one of us is great approaching to people, another one of us has basic Japanese language skills. In the end, if the two us are able to go, the richer the final product will be. Recently, we began another adventure in that area,
<a href=""http://storygoggle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Storygoggle.com </a>where we collaborate with Antonio, a longtime friend, is also helping us in the design department for this project, he also loves photography. Storygoggle is on its very early days; it is a place to show not only our
 photographs, but to tell the stories we keep in them. In the future,
we would like to make Storygoggle available in more languages (it's only in Spanish right now), to reach more people like you, and to invite you to join us and tell your
story.<span>  </span></p>
<p><b>Risks and
challenges </b></p>
<p>Most of us
have been doing photography for as long as 9 or 10 years now (courses included), but we do not
make photos for a living. Our biggest strength is that we love the city. As
architects, and urbanists, our approach to the matter will be closer to the
knowledge we have. As we mentioned, we are combining different skills, and it
all helps. Photography was chosen as the medium to send this message, because
as it happens, is also something we love. </p>
<p>We have an
11 days plan for doing the shots we need for our project. This plan is based on
a schedule made to visit the areas and streets that we have identified as interesting (if you
want to contribute here, all help would be greatly appreciated), that are
representative of Tokyo, and that are viable for us to shoot there. There
is some previous work we will have to do regarding to the city itself, long
distance scouting, of everything we are going to see when we arrive there, the
history and characteristics of important streets, social and cultural general
knowledge, are most of those tasks. </p>
<p>When we arrive in Tokyo, there’s
also some work to be done, for example, go to the locations themselves with pen
and paper, and recognize how they work, what do they mean to people, what is a
great Tokyo street, maybe if time permits sketch what calls our attention most
(if we do it, we will include it in the book as a bonus). All this previous, and in situ
work, will help us to identify what, where and how, we have to photograph.</p>
<p>After our trip, we will go through
the selection process of our pictures, then, the editing will be done using tools like adobe photoshop, and lightroom. We will do
the graphic design, and we’ll be using other adobe tools to create the book
ourselves. 80%-90% of the book will be pictures, he rest, observations, about the people, the city, and the streets. The project will be divided
by areas, and we will show our journey in a map for all of you to know, where is
what, when talking about streets in Tokyo. For the printed versions of the book, we will be using blurb.com
platform to deliver the best quality possible for this kind of job. The book in both versions, will be between 80 and 90 pages long. </p>

<p>We care and are passionate about
cities, and specially their streets. We think all of the people have to do more
for our cities, because helping them, within our possibilities, big or small, is
helping ourselves. I love Tokyo streets is just the beginning.<span>  </span></p>
<br/><p></p></div>","We love
streets. 
“We go back
to some streets more often than others, not just because the things we have to
do are more centered on one street than another. We may choose to focus a part
of our lives on a street for reasons that are not necessarily economic or
functional. Maybe a particular street unlocks memories, or offers expectations
of something pleasant to be seen, or the possibility of an encounter. Because
some streets are more pleasant than others, we may go out of our way to be on
them, even on a trip to somewhere else.” Allan B. Jacobs, Looking, learning, making. 
Reading the
likes of urbanists, and writers, like Allan Jacobs, Bernard Rudosfky, Jan Gehl,
Jane Jacobs, has changed the way we traditionally thought about
what a street really is. We want to show why streets are so important for our
cities, using the ideas of the people that know about them the best, the same
people which ideas helped to create the structure of a master’s degree urban
thesis for one of us in our team, and extending some of those ideas into a
photographic project: a book called, I love Tokyo streets.
Why is the
street important? 
-Streets are
more than public utilities, more than linear physical spaces that permit people
and good to get from here to there (A.Jacobs). Streets are 80% of the usable
public space in our cities (pps.org) 
-“The street
is where you go to see people, and to be seen by people” (A.Jacobs). The street is
where cities come to life, it’s also one of the most important physical spaces,
where identity and belonging to the city is born. 
-We know the
city through knowing our streets. We know the streets where the people we love
live, we know the streets of the places we love to go. In a way of speaking, we
know what we love better, in more detail. Imagine if we could love our cities
more, and take more care about them, by improving our streets. 
-Great streets are for everyone, if you have a car it’s ok, if you don’t it’s
ok. This is the place where we are all the same, where democracy truly exists,
and where we, together, can continue to grow and make our cities more
humanized. 
Why Tokyo?
As of
recently, Tokyo has been named the most livable city on earth by
the monocle magazine. The three of us feel this is the place to do this
project. Being a megalopolis this size, we find it similar in some numbers to
Mexico City (capital of our country), but there also are clear differences,
huge differences. ""It manages to do something no other global metropolis can: provide a great quality of life for those who live there and also visit. From culture to security, food to courtesy, it has everything covered,"" Monocle says of Tokyo. ""London and New York, take note.""We want to show that, and why, in a very high
measure, great cities are among a lot of other things, a result of having great
streets. This is the way we see to contribute to the city cause in our country,
where the cities are transformed and developed by the economics of greed, not
the human need.

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471584721/ngigjfomb57hrgdla0mf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The model we are featuring is Tsuki, she has been largely involved in cosplay and casual shoots with Kyudot. As a team we share the same joy and delight achieving photos and different themes, spending hours inspiring and helping each other to become better at what we do and this is her first big project in getting her ideas together in one book as a product!

<p><span><strong>Who we are:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In October of 2010 we (Jessa and Dan Koppenhofer) decided to start a farmers' market in Gilbert, Arizona with our mission focusing around local sustainability, healthy eating and green living practices among our town and the surrounding area. Since that day we have always searched for ways to improve our market and to get back to those grassroots which made a farmers' market the gathering place of the entire community. After our first successful year open, we came to the conclusion that books and documentaries can only take us so far and that a Road Trip was the next step in finding the answers which we are seeking.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What is the Goal of this Road Trip?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Our initial goal is to study the differences between the markets; location, layout, booth setups, traffic, etc... and plan to apply some of the findings into our market in hopes of </span><span>improving </span>our market for our community. By improving our market we can improve others in the future. </p>
<p><span>The long term goal is to create a picture book and a farmers’ market guide for costumers, vendors and coordinators in order to bridge the gap between markets and establish the farmers’ market in its rightful place as the gathering place of the community.</span></p>
<p><span>We plan to accomplish this by showing the public the beauty and lifestyle of the market, which is not just a ‘local thing’ but truly a reborn movement from coast to coast.</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, farmers’ markets are the essence of being local, or at least they should be, but it is our believe that it can be much more than that. As a good friend ones told me, “Farmers’ markets are the travelers best friend. Not only do you get fresh produce while on the road, you get to taste the local flavors and experience the local culture as well”.*</span></p>
<p>Think this trip is a vacation? Think again! To visit the 50 plus markets on our list, it will take us 67 days with an average of 4 to 5 hours drive per day! Between exploring the markets, driving and catching some shut eye in between, there is no relaxing on this trip.</p>
<p><span><strong>Why 67 Days and what markets?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The reason for 67 days is to make the trip work for all the markets we plan to visit and feature in the Photo Book. With certain markets being open only on a specific day of the week, it makes planning this trip quite difficult. </span></p>
<p><span>Our Road Trip Schedule is still a work in progress until the day we leave! If you have any suggestions, please send us a message.</span></p>
<p><span>Viewing our current schedule should explain it all: <a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46645013/Markets.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><strong>Road Trip Schedule</strong></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong>What will you be taking pictures of?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We will be taking a plethora of pictures of anything our eyes are drawn to! We are not only looking for a beautiful picture at a market but also looking for the differences between markets and those interesting ideas which differentiate a market from the next. The pictures in the video are just some examples of what we plan to capture.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What are the funds for?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>With your help, we will be able to travel from coast to coast and visit over 50 markets which we plan to include in our market research and future books.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><span>Gasoline: $3,000 (12,000 miles at 4.25/Gallon) </span></li>
<li><span>Lodging: $4,020 (67 nights at $60/night)</span></li>
<li><span>Fulfillment/Rewards: $3,500 (about 20% of project)</span></li>
<li><span>Project Costs: $1,500 (Indiegogo/CC'd Transactions)</span></li>
<li><span>Professional Photo Book Assembly: $500 </span></li>
<li><span>Farmers' Market Book Draft: $3,999 (Schiel &amp; Denver)</span></li>
<li><span>On Road Emergencies: $1,000</span></li>
<li><span>Food/Personal Expenses: $0 (out of pocket costs)</span></li>
<li><span>Photography Accessories/Storage Drives: $0 (out of pocket costs)<br/><br/> Total: 17,519.00<br/> Indiegogo Goal: 17,499.00</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p><span><strong>Why iPhone Photography?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Both of us have been taking pictures for a long time, Jessa even was a Freelance Photographer with her Canon Rebel XT but with todays technology we have become more comfortable with the amazing camera inside the iPhone4S. With some of the greatest apps (and an external lens or two) this phone can take some of the most stunning pictures.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Are you any good with an iPhone?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We'd like to believe we know our way around a camera but we will let you be the judge of some of our pictures:</span></p>

<p>*Quote from Zach Berning, Owner of Overland Gourmet</p>
</div></div>","Farmers' Markets from Coast to Coast is a Road Trip which concentrates on what makes a great farmers' market and illustrates it through photography.
Who we are:
In October of 2010 we (Jessa and Dan Koppenhofer) decided to start a farmers' market in Gilbert, Arizona with our mission focusing around local sustainability, healthy eating and green living practices among our town and the surrounding area. Since that day we have always searched for ways to improve our market and to get back to those grassroots which made a farmers' market the gathering place of the entire community. After our first successful year open, we came to the conclusion that books and documentaries can only take us so far and that a Road Trip was the next step in finding the answers which we are seeking.
What is the Goal of this Road Trip?
Our initial goal is to study the differences between the markets; location, layout, booth setups, traffic, etc... and plan to apply some of the findings into our market in hopes of improving our market for our community. By improving our market we can improve others in the future. 
The long term goal is to create a picture book and a farmers’ market guide for costumers, vendors and coordinators in order to bridge the gap between markets and establish the farmers’ market in its rightful place as the gathering place of the community.
We plan to accomplish this by showing the public the beauty and lifestyle of the market, which is not just a ‘local thing’ but truly a reborn movement from coast to coast.
Yes, farmers’ markets are the essence of being local, or at least they should be, but it is our believe that it can be much more than that. As a good friend ones told me, “Farmers’ markets are the travelers best friend. Not only do you get fresh produce while on the road, you get to taste the local flavors and experience the local culture as well”.*
Think this trip is a vacation? Think again! To visit the 50 plus markets on our list, it will take us 67 days with an average of 4 to 5 hours drive per day! Between exploring the markets, driving and catching some shut eye in between, there is no relaxing on this trip.
Why 67 Days and what markets?
The reason for 67 days is to make the trip work for all the markets we plan to visit and feature in the Photo Book. With certain markets being open only on a specific day of the week, it makes planning this trip quite difficult. 
Our Road Trip Schedule is still a work in progress until the day we leave! If you have any suggestions, please send us a message.
Viewing our current schedule should explain it all: Road Trip Schedule
What will you be taking pictures of?
We will be taking a plethora of pictures of anything our eyes are drawn to! We are not only looking for a beautiful picture at a market but also looking for the differences between markets and those interesting ideas which differentiate a market from the next. The pictures in the video are just some examples of what we plan to capture.
What are the funds for?
With your help, we will be able to travel from coast to coast and visit over 50 markets which we plan to include in our market research and future books.



Gasoline: $3,000 (12,000 miles at 4.25/Gallon) 
Lodging: $4,020 (67 nights at $60/night)
Fulfillment/Rewards: $3,500 (about 20% of project)
Project Costs: $1,500 (Indiegogo/CC'd Transactions)
Professional Photo Book Assembly: $500 
Farmers' Market Book Draft: $3,999 (Schiel & Denver)

Food/Personal Expenses: $0 (out of pocket costs)
Photography Accessories/Storage Drives: $0 (out of pocket costs) Total: 17,519.00 Indiegogo Goal: 17,499.00


Why iPhone Photography?
Both of us have been taking pictures for a long time, Jessa even was a Freelance Photographer with her Canon Rebel XT but with todays technology we have become more comfortable with the amazing camera inside the iPhone4S. With some of the greatest apps (and an external lens or two) this phone can take some of the most stunning pictures.
Are you any good with an iPhone?
We'd like to believe we know our way around a camera but we will let you be the judge of some of our pictures:

<p>BEACH LOVERS: THE BOOK</p>
<p>I am raising money to produce and publish my first photo book, Beach Lovers. This book is my love letter to, for and about summer in NYC and to all New Yorkers. </p>
<p>Beach Lovers is a series about love and intimacy between couples at the beaches of NYC, focusing on the Rockaways, Fort Tilden and Coney Island.  I have spent the last six years photographing beach-goers and the intimate gestures of couples around me; some tender, rubbing sunscreen on a partner's back; others lustful, a deep kiss in the water. There is something mesmerizing about escaping from the gritty, heaving metropolis that gets so hot in the summer, to sit on such a beautiful coastline. Just a few miles away from sticky sidewalks are sandy beaches and lazy ocean waves, and couples in love. Being on the beach emboldens couples to enjoy more affectionate freedom, their inhibitions less hidden than anywhere else I've observed in the city. I capture these tender moments that would otherwise be lost or overlooked. New York is home to a one-of-a-kind beach culture – diverse, time-limited and low-profile. It’s a place that has always inspired me to pick up my camera.</p>

<h3>THE BOOK</h3>
<p>Set to publish in Fall 2021, 'Beach Lovers' is a hardcover photography book about the universality of couples in love, and the story of NYC'S uniquely gritty yet romantic beaches.

<h3>THE PHOTOGRAPHER</h3>
<p>Sharon Hughes is a Brooklyn-based freelance photographer, 15 years a New Yorker, and is from Montreal, Canada. She is drawn to the ocean and her personal work is a reflection of that.  Sharon is fascinated by the juxtaposition of beach culture and landscape in the midst of NYC’s urban chaos. She is passionate about climate justice, ocean health and plastic consumption reduction. Select Beach Lovers prints are held in permanent collection and display at The Rockaway Hotel, in Queens, NYC. The series has been featured in numerous publications, including C-41, Ain’t Bad, Feature Shoot, Medium, Lomography,  La Repubblica Italy, Women in Street, and Flavorwire. The Beach Lovers photo ‘The Couple Next Door’ was a winning image in the 2020 Women Street Photographers’ Exhibition, and was exhibited in December 2020 Artspace PS 109. The series has also been exhibited at Ground Floor Gallery in Brooklyn, at Picture Farm Gallery in Brooklyn, and Studio Galerie B &amp; B in Paris France. When she is not swimming or shooting photographs, Sharon spends her time taking care of her many plants and her two cats.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>Publishing a premium hardcover coffee table book is a big investment. As an independent artist working on my own, I don't quite have all the funds needed to make this happen, yet I can’t afford NOT to publish this special love story. Launching a book of this series series is something I've wanted to do for years, and this project is the result of a lot of hard work. The risk that I am faced with is that the book, and my vision, will not get funded. So I am turning to my community – that's you! – to help make this book a reality. ALL the funds I raise on Kickstarter will go towards the design, printing and shipping of this book. My goal is to deliver a final product that is flawless and delivered on time. Books will be in your hands by Fall 2021. Keep your eyes open for a launch party invite too! The book is underway. The photos have been shot and edited. The design and layout are in progress. Now I need your help to bring it all to life. Pre-order your copy of Beach Lovers and help me tell this NYC Summer love story that will also look great on your coffee table.

<h3>New Castro Philanthropy Project </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>The majority of the work I do as a photographer is for good causes. I volunteer my skills to individuals in financial need and non-profit organizations doing important work in the world. My work as a volunteer photographer can vary from helping a small business owner make promotional images, to documenting projects for non-profits, to offering to shoot portraits for individuals in need for professional purposes. I am including information regarding some of the pro bono work I have done over the last few years here:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.newcastrocameraphotography.com/pro-bono-and-volunteer-project.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.newcastrocameraphotography.com/pro-...</a></p>
<p>I believe deeply in the power of inclusion, so I work hard to document people who are usually left out of photographs. These are mainly marginalized communities and minorities. I spend time documenting these communities because I find it important that they are visually represented and therefore included. If people don't see themselves depicted in images of the world, they won’t feel welcome in the world. I try to help in my own small way by photographing all people, so they feel represented and welcome, regardless of their economic or social background. I also immerse myself in these communities and get to meet and interact with some amazing and inspirational people. </p>
<p>The money you contribute to this fundraiser will enable me to grow my craft and continue to give my best work to the communities you and I wish to serve. I work a few paid gigs a year, but they don’t bring in enough money for me to invest in new gear. I also teach full-time as a teacher, but that work covers my cost-of-living expenses. Your gift will enable to focus on my passion for gifting people and communities in need with photography. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Gear I Wish to Purchase</h3>
<p>This part is simple. I am seeking your support in order to purchase two pieces of equipment. One is a <strong>Fujifilm XT-2 camera.</strong> This camera is one of the most affordable professional cameras for the price. I also need a <strong>Rotolight LED Light</strong>. This is also a very affordable option. I am only comfortable asking for these items because they’re the most economical way to do the work I want to share in the world. This also lets me volunteer my time as opposed to money, which as a teacher I can't afford. I am also a teacher and have volunteered time teaching younger and less experienced photographers in need. Any extra funds would go to that type of work as well. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Having new gear will allow me to continue my work for many years to come. It will also allow me to donate my time to help others instead of having to earn the money for gear myself, which, as an educator is very tough. The funds for this project will allow me to help many more people. If my fundraising goals go above what I have asked for, it would allow me to put more money and energy to help others. I could supply prints and materials for others. </p>

</div></div>","New Castro Philanthropy Project 
 
The majority of the work I do as a photographer is for good causes. I volunteer my skills to individuals in financial need and non-profit organizations doing important work in the world. My work as a volunteer photographer can vary from helping a small business owner make promotional images, to documenting projects for non-profits, to offering to shoot portraits for individuals in need for professional purposes. I am including information regarding some of the pro bono work I have done over the last few years here:
https://www.newcastrocameraphotography.com/pro-...
I believe deeply in the power of inclusion, so I work hard to document people who are usually left out of photographs. These are mainly marginalized communities and minorities. I spend time documenting these communities because I find it important that they are visually represented and therefore included. If people don't see themselves depicted in images of the world, they won’t feel welcome in the world. I try to help in my own small way by photographing all people, so they feel represented and welcome, regardless of their economic or social background. I also immerse myself in these communities and get to meet and interact with some amazing and inspirational people. 
The money you contribute to this fundraiser will enable me to grow my craft and continue to give my best work to the communities you and I wish to serve. I work a few paid gigs a year, but they don’t bring in enough money for me to invest in new gear. I also teach full-time as a teacher, but that work covers my cost-of-living expenses. Your gift will enable to focus on my passion for gifting people and communities in need with photography. 

 
Gear I Wish to Purchase
This part is simple. I am seeking your support in order to purchase two pieces of equipment. One is a Fujifilm XT-2 camera. This camera is one of the most affordable professional cameras for the price. I also need a Rotolight LED Light. This is also a very affordable option. I am only comfortable asking for these items because they’re the most economical way to do the work I want to share in the world. This also lets me volunteer my time as opposed to money, which as a teacher I can't afford. I am also a teacher and have volunteered time teaching younger and less experienced photographers in need. Any extra funds would go to that type of work as well. 
 

The Impact
Having new gear will allow me to continue my work for many years to come. It will also allow me to donate my time to help others instead of having to earn the money for gear myself, which, as an educator is very tough. The funds for this project will allow me to help many more people. If my fundraising goals go above what I have asked for, it would allow me to put more money and energy to help others. I could supply prints and materials for others. 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot afford to contribute it would be very helpful to offer the following. 
1. Share my campaign on social media. 
2. Purchase my photography services. I offer individual and family portraits. I offer 8mm and 16mm film to video, slide and photograph scanning, and full events (weddings/ bat mitzvah).
3. Refer people to buy my photography services in the future.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Story</strong></h2>
<p>I have that type of personality that just gets excited about a lot of things.</p>
<p>All of my interests whether it's surfing, whether it's photography, whether it's music or classic cars, to me there's always a common thread through it all.</p>
<p>This idea of just finding enjoyment and things that are challenging.</p>
<p>In 2015 i'm graduated from Cinema University in Lisbon, Portugal, and after that, I flew to Los Angeles to do an internship for 3 months. When I arrived there I saw that LA is not what the majority of the people think and see in the movies, that city has a big soul surrounded by different cultures, who live their everyday lives trying hard to survive in that jungle.</p>
<p>It was that vibe of the city, his vibrant energy who makes me start shooting since the first day. I remember the day that I arrived, i'm staying in a hostel close to Pico Blvd, it was not the most fancy area, but for me was a start and I like that, i like to see the real life of the city, not the fake part. So I take my film camera and my skate and start shooting and exploring. I remember that first day I finished in Venice Beach with a very big orange sunset behind the skatepark and said to myself, This is LA.</p>
<p>It was day life and that mix of cultures and freedom who fascinated me. The city is huge, and i explore a lot, i run skate, bicycle and off course you need a car, one day i was editing some fresh scanned photos in a coffee shop and girl pass me, and said, ""i like the vibe of your pictures, you should think to do something with that...""</p>

When i saw the frames from Los Angeles, the idea to make something organic with that, to make a piece of art and not just a random frames, in that particular time the name ""Angels behind the Stars"" come back to my mind and i decided to go back to LA and finish what i started five years ago.</p>

Vigdis Finnbogadóttir, former
state president of Iceland, or Hördur Torfason, at the time one of the leading heads of
the Icelandic protest movement and some others, and I found out that not only the nature is unique, but
that also the people, in their own way represent things I can hardly put into words.Things that maybe have something to do with terms like grace, strength and being
aware of oneself. 
		<p></p>Another important aspect is, that I hadn't seen myself as a landscape photographer before this absurd icelandic nature inspired me in 2009 - I´m actually much more a portrait photographer. So now I can wonderfully bring these things together in a project, which I think is completely new in history of photography. <span><br/></span><h4><span><br/></span></h4><h3>Description of the portrait concept within 'You are here...':</h3><p>
</p><p><span>My portrait photographic philosophy is among other things influenced by <i>Richard Avedon's formidable </i>opus <i>'In the American West’</i>.<br/></span>The plan is to portray persons from various groups of society and professions, such as
farmers, fishermen, pilots, students, volcanologists, kids and old people etc. on location, in front
of the always same background, and furthermore do the same with internationally well known
personalities, like artists, musicians, writers, actors….<span><br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><span><br/></span></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Thanks to Ágúst, we are very well networked in Iceland, so that the enterprise of making
more than 100 portraits of Icelanders-­‐ a profile of the whole community-­‐ will be easy to
conduct. </span></p><p><span>Just to give you an idea, how our portraits might look alike - I show you following portrait from the year 2008 as a sample. </span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330915/files/20140126133403-sample_portrait_indie.jpg?1390772043"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Studiowork , Germany 2008 © Julian Kirschler<span><br/></span></i><span></span><span><br/></span>But finally I am open minded - I want to be inspired by the atmosphere on the set and open for the interaction with the people I portray.<br/>The only thing I really know according to the Portraits is that we will build a setting where the people feel themselves comfortable with us, so that great things can rise.<br/><p></p><h3></h3><h2>As things stand now...<br/>

<p></p></div>","Hello - my name is Julian Kirschler. I am a german photographer, based in Berlin and Pforzheim.'You are here...' is the title of a photo art project that, for the first time, combines different kinds of landscape photography and a series of conceptual portraits.The stage for our enterprise is an island in the Northern Atlantic about which, Kate Humble has said the following in the course of the BBC report ´A Volcano Live Special´:'I think this is the strangest most otherworldly landscape I’ve ever seen. It's just great chaotic -­‐ lumps and piles of rock covered in this thick khaki grey moss. It's just weird. It's almost as if some giant crumbled up pieces of cake all over the plains and they've gone moldy.'It´s all about Iceland!
Former State President Vigdis Finnbogadóttir responded in our interview in 2009, when addressed on the financial crisis: 'Iceland will master this challenge -­‐ the worse the situation, the more composed the Icelander will react.'  She also indicated a relation between landscape and people.Vigdis Finnbogadóttir, April 2009 © Julian KirschlerOur Mission:
Photography for international exhibitions and 3 illustrated books...
'The land makes the people' is one of the central issues that I deal with in 'You are here...' with photographic means. 'You are here...' will be realized for international exhibitions and 3 illustrated books, that will be published by ARNOLDSCHE ART PUBLISHERS with the following contents:1. AIRshots – aerial images    containing text originating from the 'Icelandic Journal' 1871/73 by William Morris2. CARshots & FLOWshots – photographs taken out of the driving car a.o.    containing text originating from the 'Icelandic Journal' by 1871/73 William Morris3. Portraits – more than 100 Portraits in front of a neutral background    (each book has 120 pages)To show our work in museums up to sizes of 4 x 6 meters, we shoot with a 80 MP High Resolution Camera.How the story began...during the course of the political report with the title ‘No man is an island - Moments captured between fire and ice’, wich I accomplished as a photographer together with the journalist Thomas Rump in 2009 –  I made my first aerial shots of iceland.Þingvellir, April 2009 © Julian KirschlerLeft to right: Ágúst Már Kristinsson and Thomas Rump. In front: Julian Kirschlersomewhere in the middle of nowhere, Iceland in April 2009 © Julian KirschlerThe birth of 'You are here...'In the year 2011 Ágúst accompanied me again to Iceland and we started to photograph the glacier region of Vatnajökull from above and furthermore started the concept CARshots with a series of landscape photography out of a driving car – both now basal for the 'You are here...' art project.AIRshot, Vatnajökull August 2011 © Julian KirschlerCARshot, Geitdalur, September 2011 © Julian KirschlerIn the end of 2011 I made a test exhibition of our AIRshots and CARshots, with the goal to validate my assumptions on the effect of the photographs and their size on an audience. I showed images sized up to 180 cm x 120 cm and was happy to find assumptions confirmed by most of the 100 guests.""The images should be even much larger""
The photographs seem picturesque, what has also been directly said that evening: 'This is
actually not photography but one has tried to paint'.Together with this exhibition I self published a photo book with an important aspect of uniqueness, created by the adding of text
to my landscape photography -­‐ text from a different time and even different places on
Iceland. The idea here for, was contributed by Elisa Artega, who works with the graphic artist who helped me with the book. The words originate from the 'Icelandic Journal' by William Morris, who visited Iceland
in 1871. His depiction of the landscape complement my photography in a wondrous
way. 
book excerpt AIRshots I Carshots © Julian Kirschler 2011In 2012 I first started to think about adding a special kind of portrait photography to the concept, remembering that I had met various Icelanders, portrayed some of them.E.g. Vigdis Finnbogadóttir, former
state president of Iceland, or Hördur Torfason, at the time one of the leading heads of
the Icelandic protest movement and some others, and I found out that not only the nature is unique, but
that also the people, in their own way represent things I can hardly put into words.Things that maybe have something to do with terms like grace, strength and being
aware of oneself. 
		Another important aspect is, that I hadn't seen myself as a landscape photographer before this absurd icelandic nature inspired me in 2009 - I´m actually much more a portrait photographer. So now I can wonderfully bring these things together in a project, which I think is completely new in history of photography. Description of the portrait concept within 'You are here...':
My portrait photographic philosophy is among other things influenced by Richard Avedon's formidable opus 'In the American West’.The plan is to portray persons from various groups of society and professions, such as
farmers, fishermen, pilots, students, volcanologists, kids and old people etc. on location, in front
of the always same background, and furthermore do the same with internationally well known
personalities, like artists, musicians, writers, actors….Thanks to Ágúst, we are very well networked in Iceland, so that the enterprise of making
more than 100 portraits of Icelanders-­‐ a profile of the whole community-­‐ will be easy to
conduct. Just to give you an idea, how our portraits might look alike - I show you following portrait from the year 2008 as a sample. Studiowork , Germany 2008 © Julian KirschlerBut finally I am open minded - I want to be inspired by the atmosphere on the set and open for the interaction with the people I portray.The only thing I really know according to the Portraits is that we will build a setting where the people feel themselves comfortable with us, so that great things can rise.As things stand now...
We have a letter of intend of the internationally well known publisher ARNOLDSCHE ART PUBLISHERS to present. We also have an letter of intend of a first museum to present, where we can expose 'You are here…' in 2015.First visualizations for the museum for a first ""You are here..."" exhibition in 2015.Why do we need Your support?
Together with my production manager and scout Ágúst Már Kristinsson - i need to produce further pictures in superb 80 Megapixel quality. This will enable us to show unique images with a 'WOW effect' in museums all over the world, some of them sized even up to 4 x 6 meters. This is the last step to complete a photographic work, we already began and that was fully funded by myself.
Bank advisors unfortunately laugh at you, when you ask to obtain funding for a serious art project.
What do we ask you to support?
 Your support enables me to realize following issues:
- the whole production in Iceland this summer within about 4 Months
- paying my assistants fairly
- hiring some of the high end technical equipment we need 
- getting to Iceland
- hiring a home base apartment in Reykjavik
- hiring a 4whd  production car to shoot further CARshots
- hiring production planes and helicopters to shoot further AIRshots
- traveling all over Iceland to cast and shoot portraits in front of a neutral background
- hiring apartments or hotel rooms when we´re on tour to do portraits,or landscapes- the final artwork for more than 200 very high defintion images for the books- starting the artwork for the book with an excellent graphic designer- starting the preprint process of the books- proofing more than 200 images for the art printing
What will you get for supporting us?We offer you a wide range of things, for everything you like and you can affort.Starting up with your name in our backers list, for just a few bucks, on www.you-are-here.is, over a set of beautiful postcards to our book box, which will be delivered in premium art print quality.

<h2>Om boken</h2>
<p>I fotoboken Studentajävlar samlar jag ett urval av alla de tusentals bilder jag tagit under åren som fotograf och bildchef på tidningen Lundagård. Genom att göra en bok får jag äntligen möjlighet att ge bildreportagen det utrymme de förtjänar och dela med mig av foto som aldrig kom i tryck. Jag har alltid tyckt att bilden av studentlivet ibland blir för snäv och därför har jag försökt ge en mångfacetterad bild av hur det är att vara student i Lund idag. Men det som man tydligt förknippar med lunds studentliv finns såklart också representerat i boken.  I boken ryms bilder från ryttarföreningen LARS, husockupationer, Hallands nations fotbollslag, Prästvigning i domkyrkan, utgrävningar i Uppåkra, Karnevalståg och karnevalskabaré, studentkörsturné, kafferep hemma hos rektorn,  Spexet Ivar Kreuger och mycket mer. Allt skildrat utifrån studentens perspektiv och med människor och möten i fokus.</p>

<p>Även om många kan känna igen sig i boken så är syftet att den ska vara mer än en intern angelägenhet. Men för många kan den säkert hjälpa till att fylla lite av det tomrum som uppstår när man lämnat Lund och undrar vad det var som egentligen hände. </p>

Money:
Almost $5K is going toward printing postcards, posters and shirts.
$3.5K- paying for the creative team (Photographer, rigger, hair/makeup) & travel and stuff.
$1K- Costumes & props

<p>I am <strong>Bastien</strong> and I live in Paris. Today in France is an interesting time. There is a big contrast between the dreamed romantic Paris and the everyday life we live here, full of bad-media fulling our heads with bullshits, poverty, unemployment on one side &amp; lost people over-consuming on the other. In a word : a declining society.</p>
<p>My project would be to have a good camera enabling me to make a photo &amp; video documentary about this contrast which is I think really representative of the western world. I think today is the good period to interview tourists from abroad &amp; from every part of the french society, from beggar to every high class personn I could reach.</p>
<p>I make photo &amp; videos for long time now and everything produced would be free to use and to share of course. As the project would be crowd funded, I can also think of crowd produced.</p>

<p>all the best<br/>bastien</p></div>","Hello people,
I am Bastien and I live in Paris. Today in France is an interesting time. There is a big contrast between the dreamed romantic Paris and the everyday life we live here, full of bad-media fulling our heads with bullshits, poverty, unemployment on one side & lost people over-consuming on the other. In a word : a declining society.
My project would be to have a good camera enabling me to make a photo & video documentary about this contrast which is I think really representative of the western world. I think today is the good period to interview tourists from abroad & from every part of the french society, from beggar to every high class personn I could reach.
I make photo & videos for long time now and everything produced would be free to use and to share of course. As the project would be crowd funded, I can also think of crowd produced.
The amount of money I need is around 1500€ to make this project alive.

Pride Photo Award is an international contest of photography that shows the diversity of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.</span></p>
<p>These photographers (from Russia, Mexico, Vietnam, USA … ) have
brought together a collection of powerful, amazing images that
show the strength, the courage and the love of people who live in
difficult circumstances. They
have uncovered surprising and touching stories, from the first
Islamic school for transgenders in Indonesia to gay and lesbian
soldiers in the USA army. Some photos reveal the intolerance and
ignorance many LGBT people are confronted with, while others bring forth a
message of hope and love. </p><p><br/></p><h3>Your Impact</h3><p>By
supporting this book project you
will support a powerful message of equality
and diversity. The more people view
these images, the more successful we will become in advancing acceptance for LGBT people.
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>In exchange for a small contribution, you will receive a unique photography book that tells the stories of people who, like you, want to be accepted,
want to	love and be loved. Keep it for yourself, give it to a
	special friend or share it with everyone you know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover,
	you will be an advocate
	of
	the art of more than eighty amazing photographers from all over the

public opinion is growing more tolerant, and to enlighten open minded people in
countries where LGBT’s are generally accepted, about the situation
elsewhere. </span>

<i>""Lack
of knowledge creates fear. And sometimes fear transforms into hate. As the
proverb goes: unknown, unloved. In my eyes, hatred for gay and
transgender people is mainly due to a lack of (correct) information. For this
reason, the work of Pride Photo Award is so important. The organization is
committed to give visibility to gay and transgender people in a balanced way,
that is in a way that goes beyond stereotypes.  In recent years, numerous
winners have shown that it is not necessary to be afraid or <span>feel hatred towards gay and transgender people.
Personally, I am particularly pleased with the positive attention for
transgenders within Pride Photo Award. Their emancipation is lagging behind
compared to that of gay people, and the statistics on discrimination,
dismissal, loneliness and suicide are shocking. The fact that the jury of
the Award has chosen a powerful image of trans people as the winning
photo in two consecutive editions is very
important.<br/></span></i><i><br/></i>
</blockquote><blockquote><i>Several
pictures from Pride Photo Award appeared in the media worldwide. But media are
volatile. What hits the retina today is forgotten tomorrow. Therefore, I think
that collecting all pictures in one book can serve as a strong weapon in the
fight against ignorance and a good way to increase visibility permanently.  I
urge everyone to donate to this charity. ”</i></blockquote><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Chloe Meynier</b> – </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Photographer (Pride Photo Award 2013 series </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Gendernormality</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">) </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></i><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><a href=""http://www.chloemeynier.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.chloemeynier.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.chloemeynier.com</a></i></p><p></p><blockquote>""By starting this project, I wanted to raise social consciousness, to build understanding and respect.

the LadyBoy series in Thailand, my goal was to show tolerance in this country.
To express through my images that these people have a life like everyone else
and above were accepted by families and people in general. I
was tired of hearing here in Europe they are just ladyboy people working in
prostitution.<br/>When [project

Pride Photo Award is an interesting and important project, simultaneously
advancing contemporary LGBTQ issues and thought-provoking photography. As one
of the jurors said to me during the exhibition, first and foremost the
photographs must be strong, and I was honored to be among the talented group of
winners in 2012. Creating a book of the Pride Photo Award would realize an
important archive of worldwide contemporary Queer issues, as well as current
photographic ideologies. I believe this book would quickly become a collector's
item, and be referenced in classrooms around the world."" </blockquote><blockquote><br/></blockquote>

The
photo book will be a powerful tool to help spread these images. A
book is lasting, people can keep it and look through it as often as
they wish, it can be shared with others or offered as a beautiful
gift. 

</p><p>
</p><p>With
this collection of photographs you can help us reach out to
people, to make them wonder, think and feel. With these images we can
create a greater awareness of sexual and gender diversity, help
combat stereotypes and increase the acceptance of sexual and gender diversity, allowing people to be themselves and to love without the
need to fear. We want to inspire hope and to honour
the photographers and the brave people whose stories they tell.

ask you to help us publish the photo book Pride Uncovered marking the 5th
anniversary of Pride Photo Award. Pride Photo Award is an international contest of photography that shows the diversity of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.
These photographers (from Russia, Mexico, Vietnam, USA … ) have
brought together a collection of powerful, amazing images that
show the strength, the courage and the love of people who live in
difficult circumstances. They
have uncovered surprising and touching stories, from the first
Islamic school for transgenders in Indonesia to gay and lesbian
soldiers in the USA army. Some photos reveal the intolerance and
ignorance many LGBT people are confronted with, while others bring forth a
message of hope and love. Your ImpactBy
supporting this book project you
will support a powerful message of equality
and diversity. The more people view
these images, the more successful we will become in advancing acceptance for LGBT people.


In exchange for a small contribution, you will receive a unique photography book that tells the stories of people who, like you, want to be accepted,
want to	love and be loved. Keep it for yourself, give it to a
	special friend or share it with everyone you know.


Moreover,
	you will be an advocate
	of
	the art of more than eighty amazing photographers from all over the
	world, who often
	worked under difficult conditions to bring you these powerful stories.

TestimonialsBoris Dittrich –  Advocacy Director for the LGBT program of Human Rights Watch
""As Advocacy Director for the LGBT program
of Human Rights Watch I often meet people who base their opinion about LGBT people on myths
and stereotypes. The only way to counter these myths and stereotypes is by
showing people what reality looks like. Visibility of the LGBT
community is an essential first step to counter these myths and stereotypes.
The photo book Pride Uncovered is a
welcome addition to that visibility.Pride Photo Award has
brought together photos that tell stories from all over the world. Photos that
show the reality of LGBT’s in many different countries. These stories need to
be seen and shared, to empower the brave activists in countries where LGBT’s
face repression, to further understanding and acceptance in countries where the
public opinion is growing more tolerant, and to enlighten open minded people in
countries where LGBT’s are generally accepted, about the situation
elsewhere. 
Sometimes pictures tell stories that cannot be encompassed in reports. Art is a basic need and is often influential in bringing about much needed change in society.I wholeheartedly support this book and hope you
will support the campaign to make this book reality.""Saskia Laseur – Partner and Civil-Law Notary at Van Doorne, sponsor of the Pride Photo Award contest

“Since its first edition Pride Photo Award has grown to become a unique yearly event in the photography world. Powered almost exclusively by numerous dedicated volunteers, they have managed to attract hundreds of talented photographers all over the world.I support this campaign, because these amazing photos and this unique event deserve a pride book. I believe in the transformative power of art to show people the beauty and the value of diversity. In diversity there’s beauty and there’s strength. That’s an important message for our company too.”
Anna Wahlgren – Photographer (Pride Photo Award 2013 Leaving one’s tribe)  www.annawahlgrenphotography.com""We hear more and more about the repression of people from LGBT-communities around the world. With stories on the theme this book has a unique content and is therefore an important project which I hope will be realized. I think it can be an eye-opener to many people and as well be a valuable archive of the lives of LGBT around the world. I am proud to be part of this project.""Cindy Aquino – Photographer (Pride Photo Award 2013 Bond) indienardophotography.blogspot.nl
“I
am very honored to be part of this crowdfunding project, as it will serve as an
eye opener to people that LGBT’s have something special about them. That they
are as Normal as straight people. They are creative and unique in their own way
and deserve respect, acceptance and love. This book will help stop stereotype
thinking about Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgender people.”  
Jasper Groen – Photographer  www.jaspergroen.nl

""Lack
of knowledge creates fear. And sometimes fear transforms into hate. As the
proverb goes: unknown, unloved. In my eyes, hatred for gay and
transgender people is mainly due to a lack of (correct) information. For this
reason, the work of Pride Photo Award is so important. The organization is
committed to give visibility to gay and transgender people in a balanced way,
that is in a way that goes beyond stereotypes.  In recent years, numerous
winners have shown that it is not necessary to be afraid or feel hatred towards gay and transgender people.
Personally, I am particularly pleased with the positive attention for
transgenders within Pride Photo Award. Their emancipation is lagging behind
compared to that of gay people, and the statistics on discrimination,
dismissal, loneliness and suicide are shocking. The fact that the jury of
the Award has chosen a powerful image of trans people as the winning
photo in two consecutive editions is very
important.
Several
pictures from Pride Photo Award appeared in the media worldwide. But media are
volatile. What hits the retina today is forgotten tomorrow. Therefore, I think
that collecting all pictures in one book can serve as a strong weapon in the
fight against ignorance and a good way to increase visibility permanently.  I
urge everyone to donate to this charity. ”Chloe Meynier – Photographer (Pride Photo Award 2013 series Gendernormality) www.chloemeynier.com""By starting this project, I wanted to raise social consciousness, to build understanding and respect. I want my art to celebrate diversity by making the viewer see in way he/she has not seen before. My goal is to eradicate the fear of the difference in people, as well as the taboo aspect associated with the transgender community. I feel like we are making progress but there is still a long way before we reach equality and respect. This photography project is my way to contribute to make a better world for the future generations and by contributing to the realization of an amazing book, you are also a part of moving the world forward so thank you very much for your support.""Jean-Michel Clajot – Photographer (Pride Photo Award 2011 series LadyBoys, Born to be a Woman)
“The education of
my parents was to teach me tolerance and openness.My work as a
photographer allows me to go to communities of people who say they are
different. And understand their lives and especially the daily problems they
may encounter.When I photographed
the LadyBoy series in Thailand, my goal was to show tolerance in this country.
To express through my images that these people have a life like everyone else
and above were accepted by families and people in general. I
was tired of hearing here in Europe they are just ladyboy people working in
prostitution.When [project
manager] Joeri Kempen told me about this project of a photo book about love and
being yourself, I found this particularly ambitious and hopeful for a better
future in the tolerance of our fellow men. I sincerely hope that this project
comes to pass.”

Richard Sandell – Photographer (Pride Photo Award 2013 photo At home with… Andrew and Irene)""As a researcher who has analysed how viewers respond to images of lgbt people in the public sphere I'm well aware of the power of such images to influence the way people think, feel and act. Efforts, in recent years, to secure more respectful ways of representing gender and sexual diversity have undoubtedly played a critical role in shaping the climate within which discrimination and prejudice against lgbt people can be tackled. But toxic images - negatively stereotypical images that close off opportunities for understanding and respect - are still widespread, fuelling prejudice, discrimination and hate crimes that disproportionately affect young people.This is why this book and the broader work of the Pride Photo Award is so important. If you can, please pledge your support to be a part of bringing this book and the moving, inspiring and arresting images within it to a broader audience.""

Ricardo Garcia – Photographer (Pride Photo Award 2011 series Transmen of the world) www.garcia-photography.com
""I am Manuel
Ricardo Garcia, FTM and Transactivist from Munich / Germany. For me it means a
lot to support  the photo book 5 years
Pride Photo Award, because it helps to make the LGBTIQ community more visible,
for me especially the trangender people, in our fight for more tolerance and
love in this world.""Chris Belloni – Maker of the documentary film I am Gay and Muslim www.iamgayandmuslim.com
""Ik draag Pride Photo Award en het realiseren van het boek een warm
hart toe want ik vind het een prachtig initiatief. Pride Photo Award is in de
afgelopen vijf jaar uitgegroeid tot een een evenement met internationale allure
dat veel aanzien geniet onder fotografen.
Het maakt LHBT-fotografie in de meest uiteenlopende vormen zichtbaar en zet
mensen aan tot denken. Ik ben er trots op dat de fotoserie I am Gay and
Muslim erin is opgenomen. Ik steun de crowdfundingcampagne met een
bijdrage. Doet u ook mee?""Willem Poelstra – Photographer www.willempoelstra.nl (Pride Photo Award 2011 series Lowlanders)""Fotografie is een vluchtig medium geworden. Belangrijke onderwerpen als LGBT worden verdrongen door allerlei niet ter zaken doende onderwerpen omdat iedereen op het internet 'publiceert'. Een boek is een blijvend document, waar je langer bij stil staat en dieper raakt. Het komt op plekken buiten de directe doelgroep en zet die mensen weer tot denken."" 

Hinda
Schuman – Photographer www.hindaschuman.net (Pride Photo Award 2011 series A True Story)
""The Pride Photo Award
is a wonderful initiative that showcases the work of an international group of
photographers working with themes relating to the LGBT community. For the
public this opens up a world often hidden from view. For photographers, this
can be an opportunity to seek out specific stories, or to continue on a
relevant project with the hopes of an international audience. 

The photographs run the gamut from portrait, to
story telling to journalism to fine art- and all genres in between. To have a
book produced of winning entries over the first few years of the festival would
be a way to reach a broader audience and put the event in an historical light.
I would love to be a part of the book, and would be interested in doing
whatever I can to support the crowd sourcing fundraising effort.""
Bradley Secker – Photographer www.bradleysecker.com (Pride Photo Award 2011 series Iraq’s Gay Refugees)""As my work in the LGBT field focuses mostly on refugees, and those that have been displaced due to their sexuality and/or gender identity, the publication of this book would make a great difference in bringing their cases to light. There are hundreds of people around the world that are displaced from their homes, or their countries due to their identity. These people have to hide themselves and try to find a safe place to live, a search that may last years or continue their entire lives. As brutal homophobic murders continue in Iraq and neighbouring countries, I hope that the few images I have in this book embed this knowledge in the minds of everyone reading it. Through collective consciousness I hope social attitudes and policy change can take place."" Lorenzo Triburgo – Photographer triburgo.com (Pride Photo Award 2012 series Transportraits)
""The
Pride Photo Award is an interesting and important project, simultaneously
advancing contemporary LGBTQ issues and thought-provoking photography. As one
of the jurors said to me during the exhibition, first and foremost the
photographs must be strong, and I was honored to be among the talented group of
winners in 2012. Creating a book of the Pride Photo Award would realize an
important archive of worldwide contemporary Queer issues, as well as current
photographic ideologies. I believe this book would quickly become a collector's
item, and be referenced in classrooms around the world.""

Why a photo book?
The
photo book will be a powerful tool to help spread these images. A
book is lasting, people can keep it and look through it as often as
they wish, it can be shared with others or offered as a beautiful
gift. 


With
this collection of photographs you can help us reach out to
people, to make them wonder, think and feel. With these images we can
create a greater awareness of sexual and gender diversity, help
combat stereotypes and increase the acceptance of sexual and gender diversity, allowing people to be themselves and to love without the
need to fear. We want to inspire hope and to honour
the photographers and the brave people whose stories they tell.

TheCubaUnknown.com”</p></div>","Hello! We’re Makewild, a group of longtime friends from Maine now based in Venice, CA. In 2016, we traveled to Cuba to make a film about a group of athletes who risked their freedom to legitimize surfing on the island. If you can imagine, until recently, surfing in Cuba was illegal. Those in pursuit of the elusive barrel were made outlaws, risking their boards being confiscated or getting arrested. These surfers took the sport into their own hands, passionately shaping surfboards out of refrigerator doors, ceiling tiles and whatever else they could find. They paddled out to score a few moments of freedom. They inspired us. They instilled in us a new appreciation for the sport we love. They taught us a new meaning of adventure. Now we want to share these stories with the world.    ABOUT THE BOOK The Cuba Unknown is a photo book on a mission to inspire both travelers and surfers. Through photos and stories from our time on the island with local friends, we aim to reveal a lesser-known side of Cuba, beyond the old cars and decaying buildings. The book offers tips for those intrigued to make the journey, without being a total gringo. WHAT YOU'RE FUNDINGPurchasing the book and supporting the project at any level helps us finish our feature film, Havana Libre, which follows the effort to legitimize surfing in Cuba. WHAT'S INSIDE180 FSC-certified pages kinda like these below (Heidleberg offset printing on art-grade paper), sandwiched between an embossed hardcover like you saw above.  OUR FRIENDS AND SUBJECTSIn the book, you'll see a lot of this guy. This is Frank Gonzalez. We became friends early on. Apart from being a pretty stellar surfer, Frank is a true craftsman. Seeing him make a surfboard out of a refrigerator door is a true testament to the resourcefulness of the Cuban people in the face of scarcity. You'll also meet Yaya Guerrero, one of the few women surfing on the island. She's a total bad ass and at the forefront of the surf movement  to legitimize the sport in time for the 2020 Olympics.  TRAVELWhere to Explore:You'll get insight to our favorite spots: whats worth seeing in Havana, the surrounding areas outside the tourist zones, and most importantly - amazing and hard to find gems around the island.From recently discovered surf spots to waterfalls and urban destinations, this book contains a timely glimpse of the lesser known side of Cuba, plus a few good stories about what to avoid doing when you take the leap and visit this life changing island.   ARTWORKIllustrations and MapsWe partnered with the incredible artist, Allison Kunath, to create 15 original line drawings to compliment our photography, inspired by our travels in Cuba. Her artwork in the image above shares the order of hand signals (left to right) that you'll need to hail a local route-taxi in Havana.You will also find one of a kind maps to help your explorations on the island (by our very own Corey Mclean). OTHER REWARDS^Postcards ^A pack of 10 unique photos from the book, presented in postcard format to send to your favorite explorers.^Prints^Select your favorite photo from our recent show and have it printed on beautiful archival paper 12"" x 18"".

I remember walking around during the down time and having heartfelt conversations with different vendors about the fun, hardships, and rewards of being a vendor at one of New Brunswick's Farmers Markets. </p><p>The market is one of New Brunswick's oldest traditions and thousands of people head to them every single weekend.

I really believe that.

<p>My name is Alex. I've been practicing and studying photography for many years and I now feel that I am nearly ready to become a professional photographer. My dream is to be able to travel the world and document that beautiful thing called 'life'.</p>
<p>In just under a year I am hoping to be able to set off on my journey, but I have a problem; I don't have the photography equipment I need and what I need is quite expensive, especially with my low income.</p>
<p><strong>What I will use the funds for</strong></p>
<p>Becoming a photographer can be very expensive and i can´t do it without your support.</p>
<p>With the funds i raise here i will upgrade to a better camera, get several lenses, filters, lights, editing software, cover the cost of hosting, business cards and some marketing.</p>

In just under a year I am hoping to be able to set off on my journey, but I have a problem; I don't have the photography equipment I need and what I need is quite expensive, especially with my low income.
What I will use the funds for
Becoming a photographer can be very expensive and i can´t do it without your support.
With the funds i raise here i will upgrade to a better camera, get several lenses, filters, lights, editing software, cover the cost of hosting, business cards and some marketing.
I will be eternally grateful for your support!
Love, cheers and many thanks to everyone!",0.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<p>Hi, I'm George  Munday,  a professional landscape photographer, living in Ireland. My project is  a large, full color, coffee-table book called ""Waterford, A County Revealed"", a collection of beautiful photographs that takes the reader on an illustrated journey through the landscape and heritage of County Waterford.</p>
<p>But I really need your help to publish it.<br/><br/>The book is finished, designed and ready to go, but I need to raise €13,500 to cover the cost of printing 1,000 copies to the superb quality that the photography and book deserves. So I'm turning to people living in County Waterford, the wider Waterford dispora, photographers and book collectors to ask for contributions. In exchange I'm offering a number of perks, that includes among other things, pre-released signed copies of the book; an exclusive selection of signed, limited edition, art prints; and even guided photo-tours of the county.</p>
<p>Your contribution can help this unique book to see the light of day, and in turn, bring Waterford's exquisite landscape and ancient heritage  to a wider audience. <br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Why County Waterford?</strong><br/>When I relocated here, I began shooting my new county which, if I'm honest, greatly exceeded my expectations; and I literally threw myself into exploring every nook, and every cranny, of this delightful little county, along with its heritage and history. It was only later that I discovered that there were no ""coffee table"" style books available  about one of Ireland's most beautiful counties. <br/><br/>This unique book is for people who live in Waterford. For people, who as part of the Waterford diaspora, live a long way from the county, and who would like to remind themselves - and their  families - of the beauty of their homeland. It's for visitors who chance upon this lovely region and would like to have a permament momento to remember it by.</p>
<p>But it's also fellow photographers, for book collectors and for people who just enjoy stunning landscapes.<br/><br/>I've put a lot of thought into the book's layout because I wanted it to flow easily and logically for the reader, so it's been laid out in the form of a circular journey, accompanied by a hand-drawn map. Starting in the city of Waterford - the oldest city in Ireland, the journey heads west along the coast taking in fishing ports; the old mining industry of the Copper Coast; continuing on to the county town of Dungarvan and Gaelic speaking 'An Ring'. From there it continues up the Blackwater River, over the Knockmealdown and Comeragh Mountains, taking in villages, towns, historic castles and charming gardens, to finish near the city. <br/><br/>Photographing the county's many locations, was an idyllic vocation that lasted six years, during which time I frequently made repeat trips to ensure that each location was captured in the right light, and at exactly the right moment. The huge number of photographs has been edited to just over 125, most at full page or double-spread size, and each accompanied by an extensive caption.</p>
<p><strong>The Foreword</strong><br/>With the photography completed, this was one finishing touch needed before it could be published. I wanted someone who is a travel writer, someone who lives in Waterford, and above all, someone who appreciates its beauty. I had ample time whilst roaming the coast and mountains to think about it. My conclusion was that Dervla Murphy, the Irish author of over 24 adventure travel books covering the world from Ireland to India, Cuba to Capetown. Now an octogenerian, Dervla still travels, still writes and still lives in Lismore and was the perfect choice. I was delighted when, on showing her my landscape work, she liked it, and enthusiastically agreed to write a passage in her own inimatable style.<br/><br/><strong>Who am I?</strong><br/>Since leaving photography college 40 years ago, I have worked in a number of genres. First as a photojournalist, then an advertising photographer, until I eventually specialised as a landscape photograper during my time as co-director of Slidefile, the photo-agency. During those years my work appeared in countless books, from large panoramic books to small Irish guide books for Reader's Digest and other international publishers; along with innumerable magazines and calendars. <br/><br/>When I re-located to County Waterford ten years ago, I set up Copper Coast Workshops, to  teach digital photography, and conduct guided photo-tours.  Notwithstanding the fact that I'm now officially 'retired', my enjoyment when shooting the landscape has increased, and I still work on a very occasional, freelance basis for Tourism Ireland...<br/><br/>""George’s love for his adopted country and especially of his adopted county of Waterford is reflected in the quality of the imagery he has consistently produced on commission for Tourism Ireland.  Imagery that has captured the imagination of and encouraged visitors to this island of Ireland"" ....Patrick Lennon, Acting Content Manager, Tourism Ireland, <br/><br/>""Since George retired and, to quote him, 'returned to landscape photography for passion, rather than profit', it's been an enjoyable few years following his work on his blog. He studies his subject in depth and the photography shot for his new book illustrates and reveals the rich, varied landscape and heritage of County Waterford to perfection"" .... Shane O'Neill, Aspect Photography, Waterford.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Why your support is so important</strong><br/>The book is now designed and ready to print, each part has been thoroughly and expertly compiled; the images, layout and design, dust jacket, interior pages and binding; and it's my fervant hope that I will be able to see it in print form. <br/><br/>However, with 132 pages of superlative quality at a size of 10.5"" X 11.75"",  in a hard cover, it is very expensive. Which is why I need your support; and this is where Indiegogo and more especially - you - come in, because by backing this project, you can help me to achieve my goal.<br/><br/>It's not without reward. To the right, is the list of the Perks that I'm offering for your support. Designed to give excellent value, the amounts are substantially less than the combined retail value of the items. For example, the book is substantially below the anticipated shop price; the Limited Edition Gallery prints - just 20 of each are considerably below my normal gallery prices. The 10 photographs, represent a small sample of the photography in the book and can be seen by clicking the Gallery tab above. <br/><br/>Your financial support will ensure that the book will be immaculately finished, and you can show off this beautiful book and say, “I helped make it happen”.<br/><br/>If we are fortunate enough to reach our goal, then the book will be available in August this year (2013).  If we are doubly fortunate to have an excess, it will initially be put towards enhancing existing perks and adding one or two new ones. </p>
<p>The  Waterford bookshops have seen the book in digital form and would like to stock it, so we may also print a small number of additional copies. However, it's very unlikely that it will be available through on-line or overseas book shops.<br/><br/>So please, please keep on contributing until the end of the campaign.  <br/><br/>Whether you are able, or unable to take advantage of the perks, it would be a great help if you would share this project with your friends and colleagues through your social networks, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, blogs and emails etc. The more folk that know about it, the better its chance of succeeding. <br/><br/>However, this Indiegogo project is an all-or-nothing situation. If the book is to be published, the project must meet its funding goal within the time limit of 35 days. If it doesn't, no money changes hands - but it's unlikely that the book will ever be published.</p>
<p><br/>Thank you for your support, any amount, any help, will be greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>George Munday<br/><br/></p></div>","""Waterford, A County Revealed""

<h3>
<br/>Warum ein Kartenspiel?</h3>
<p><br/>Das Quartettspiel kommt eigentlich aus den Niederlanden, ist aber in Deutschland schon seit Jahrzehnten sehr verbreitet. Wir haben bereits als Kinder Quartett gespielt und die verschiedenen Rennautos, Dinosaurier oder Fußballspieler miteinander verglichen. Ich weiß heute noch, dass der furchterregende T-Rex gar nicht so gut abgeschnitten hat und man mit den großen Pflanzenfressern oft viel bessere Gewinnchancen hatte. Auch ein paar der lateinischen Namen sind hängen geblieben.<br/><br/>Diesen Nebeneffekt möchten wir nutzen. Mit Hilfe des Kartenspiels hat man jede Menge Spaß und lernt nebenbei noch etwas über die Fotografie. Natürlich gibt es bereits einige tolle Bücher zur Kamerageschichte, aber wir mögen den spielerischen Zugang und haben uns deshalb für das Quartett entschieden.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527092945/weabjec9d0jhnycprz9f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>
<br/>Wie funktioniert Quartett?</h3>
<p><br/>Unser Quartettspiel kann man auf zwei verschiedene Weisen spielen. Für beide Varianten benötigt man mindestens zwei Spieler*innen. Natürlich wird sich auch im Spiel selbst eine genaue Anleitung befinden.<br/><br/><strong>Klassisches Quartett:</strong><br/>Ziel des Spiels ist es, die meisten Quartette zu sammeln. Ein Quartett besteht aus vier Karten. Welche Karten ein Quartett bilden, erkennt man an den Symbolen auf den Karten.</p>
<p>Zunächst werden die Karten gemischt und verteilt. Die Person mit der größten Kamerasammlung beginnt und fragt eine beliebige Person nach einer Karte, die ihr zur Bildung eines Quartetts fehlt, etwa „Hast Du die Boxkamera Nr. 4?“<br/><br/>Hat die Person die gesuchte Karte, muss sie sie herausgeben und die fragende Person darf weiterhin fehlende Karten fordern. Wenn jedoch die gewünschte Karte nicht im Besitz ist, dann ist die befragte Person an der Reihe.</p>
<p>Sobald jemand ein vollständiges Quartett, etwa vier Mittelformatkameras, besitzt, legt man dieses offen vor sich auf den Tisch. Das Spiel endet, wenn die Karten aufgebraucht und alle Quartette abgelegt sind. Wer bis zum Spielende die meisten Quartette sammeln konnte, gewinnt.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Supertrumpf:</strong><br/>Unserer persönlicher Favorit. Die Karten werden gemischt und gleichmäßig an alle Spieler*innen verteilt. Man hält die Karten zu einem Päckchen gestapelt so in der Hand, dass nur das oberste Blatt für einen selbst zu sehen ist.</p>
<p>Die Person mit der größten Kamerasammlung beginnt und nennt nun einen beliebigen Vergleichswert auf ihrer Karte. Zum Beispiel: „Gewicht: 1400 g“. Die Mitspieler*innen nennen nun die entsprechenden Daten auf ihrer obersten Karte. Der beste Wert gewinnt und derjenige erhält alle Karten, die in der Runde vorgelesen wurden. Ob leichtere oder schwerere Kameras „besser“ sind, muss vor dem Spielstart vereinbart werden. Die Person mit dem besten Wert legt die gewonnen Karten unter ihren Kartenstapel und ist nun an der Reihe, einen Wert zu wählen. Gewonnen hat, wer zuletzt alle Karten besitzt.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526372784/a4zc36en2szkclki4hjz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Wie weit seid Ihr?</h3>
<p><br/>Die Idee wurde bereits Anfang 2017 geboren und nahm im Lauf der Monate immer weiter Gestalt an. Wir haben uns mit den verschiedenen Kameramodellen auseinandergesetzt, uns in die Kamerageschichte eingelesen und die schönsten und wichtigsten Kameras in Quartette aufgeteilt. Auch die Vergleichswerte sind zum Großteil bereits herausgesucht.</p>
<p>Wir haben Kontakt zu den verschiedenen Kameraherstellern aufgenommen, um rechtliche Punkte zu klären. Bis auf eine Firma haben alle unsere Idee sehr positiv aufgenommen und uns die Erlaubnis gegeben, ihre Markennamen zu verwenden!</p>
<p>Wir konnten die großartige Illustratorin <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reskinart/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Regina Cekaskin</a> für die Zeichnungen der Kameras gewinnen, die uns schon in der Vergangenheit bei anderen Produkten wie unserer Baumwolltasche unterstützt hat. Um das Kartendesign kümmert sich Fotografin und Designerin <a href=""http://lisamariekaspar.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lisa-Marie Kaspar</a>.

<h3>Welche Vergleichswerte habt Ihr?</h3>

<li>
<strong>Erscheinungsjahr:</strong> Das jeweilige Erscheinungsjahr der Kameras.</li>
<li>
<strong>Gewicht:</strong> Wieviel wiegt die Kamera? Diese Angabe steht häufig leider nicht in den alten Werbeanzeigen und Katalogen. Und wenn doch, wurde die Kamera mit oder ohne Objektiv, mit Prisma- oder Schachtsucher gewogen? Teilweise haben wir einige Kameras selbst auf die Waage gestellt oder Freund*innen, Bekannte und unsere Leser*innen dazu angestiftet.</li>
<li>
<strong>Preis damals:</strong> Wieviel hat die Kamera an ihrem Erscheinungsjahr gekostet? Je nach Währung und Zeit ist dieser Wert nur schwer zu vergleichen. Wir haben deshalb die Angaben umgerechnet. Die Preise sind im deutschen Quartett in € (im englischen in USD) angegeben und entsprechen dem Wert, den die Kameras im Verhältnis zu den Lebenskosten hatten.</li>
<li>
<strong>Preis heute:</strong> Wieviel kostet die Kamera heute? Wir haben uns Preise bei Auktionen und Second-Hand-Shops angesehen. Die Preise schwanken je nach Zustand und Glück der Käufer*innen zum Teil. Wir geben im Quartett den Durchschnittspreis einer gut erhaltenen und noch funktionstüchtigen Kamera an.</li>
<li>
<strong>Google-Treffer:</strong> Dieser Punkt war in der Redaktion zugegeben der umstrittenste. Natürlich ist er sehr einfach zu ermitteln, aber darum geht es uns nicht allein. Die Anzahl der Google-Treffer verrät vor allem etwas über die Bekanntheit der Kameras.</li>
<li>
<strong>Innovationswert:</strong> Hier möchten wir aufzeigen, wie wichtig die jeweilige Kamera für die Entwicklung der Kameratechnik war. Gab es bei den jeweiligen Modellen technische Neuerungen, die den Fortschritt der Fotografie vorangetrieben haben, dann bekommt die Kamera von uns einen höheren Innovationswert. Natürlich ist dieser zugegeben etwas subjektiv. Unsere Skala reicht von 1 bis 10.</li>

<p>Die Vergleichswerte stehen relativ fest. Wir können Dir sagen: Es war gar nicht so einfach, geeignete vergleichbare Werte zu finden und einige gute Ideen, wie zum Beispiel die Anzahl der verkauften Exemplare oder der Produktionszeitraum, mussten wir verwerfen, weil wir darüber nicht genügend Informationen gefunden haben.<br/><br/>Auf jeder Karte steht zum Schluss noch ein kleiner Text über die Kamera.

Warum ein Kartenspiel?
Das Quartettspiel kommt eigentlich aus den Niederlanden, ist aber in Deutschland schon seit Jahrzehnten sehr verbreitet. Wir haben bereits als Kinder Quartett gespielt und die verschiedenen Rennautos, Dinosaurier oder Fußballspieler miteinander verglichen. Ich weiß heute noch, dass der furchterregende T-Rex gar nicht so gut abgeschnitten hat und man mit den großen Pflanzenfressern oft viel bessere Gewinnchancen hatte. Auch ein paar der lateinischen Namen sind hängen geblieben.Diesen Nebeneffekt möchten wir nutzen. Mit Hilfe des Kartenspiels hat man jede Menge Spaß und lernt nebenbei noch etwas über die Fotografie. Natürlich gibt es bereits einige tolle Bücher zur Kamerageschichte, aber wir mögen den spielerischen Zugang und haben uns deshalb für das Quartett entschieden.


Wie funktioniert Quartett?
Unser Quartettspiel kann man auf zwei verschiedene Weisen spielen. Für beide Varianten benötigt man mindestens zwei Spieler*innen. Natürlich wird sich auch im Spiel selbst eine genaue Anleitung befinden.Klassisches Quartett:Ziel des Spiels ist es, die meisten Quartette zu sammeln. Ein Quartett besteht aus vier Karten. Welche Karten ein Quartett bilden, erkennt man an den Symbolen auf den Karten.
Zunächst werden die Karten gemischt und verteilt. Die Person mit der größten Kamerasammlung beginnt und fragt eine beliebige Person nach einer Karte, die ihr zur Bildung eines Quartetts fehlt, etwa „Hast Du die Boxkamera Nr. 4?“Hat die Person die gesuchte Karte, muss sie sie herausgeben und die fragende Person darf weiterhin fehlende Karten fordern. Wenn jedoch die gewünschte Karte nicht im Besitz ist, dann ist die befragte Person an der Reihe.
Sobald jemand ein vollständiges Quartett, etwa vier Mittelformatkameras, besitzt, legt man dieses offen vor sich auf den Tisch. Das Spiel endet, wenn die Karten aufgebraucht und alle Quartette abgelegt sind. Wer bis zum Spielende die meisten Quartette sammeln konnte, gewinnt.
Supertrumpf:Unserer persönlicher Favorit. Die Karten werden gemischt und gleichmäßig an alle Spieler*innen verteilt. Man hält die Karten zu einem Päckchen gestapelt so in der Hand, dass nur das oberste Blatt für einen selbst zu sehen ist.
Die Person mit der größten Kamerasammlung beginnt und nennt nun einen beliebigen Vergleichswert auf ihrer Karte. Zum Beispiel: „Gewicht: 1400 g“. Die Mitspieler*innen nennen nun die entsprechenden Daten auf ihrer obersten Karte. Der beste Wert gewinnt und derjenige erhält alle Karten, die in der Runde vorgelesen wurden. Ob leichtere oder schwerere Kameras „besser“ sind, muss vor dem Spielstart vereinbart werden. Die Person mit dem besten Wert legt die gewonnen Karten unter ihren Kartenstapel und ist nun an der Reihe, einen Wert zu wählen. Gewonnen hat, wer zuletzt alle Karten besitzt.

Wie weit seid Ihr?
Die Idee wurde bereits Anfang 2017 geboren und nahm im Lauf der Monate immer weiter Gestalt an. Wir haben uns mit den verschiedenen Kameramodellen auseinandergesetzt, uns in die Kamerageschichte eingelesen und die schönsten und wichtigsten Kameras in Quartette aufgeteilt. Auch die Vergleichswerte sind zum Großteil bereits herausgesucht.
Wir haben Kontakt zu den verschiedenen Kameraherstellern aufgenommen, um rechtliche Punkte zu klären. Bis auf eine Firma haben alle unsere Idee sehr positiv aufgenommen und uns die Erlaubnis gegeben, ihre Markennamen zu verwenden!
Wir konnten die großartige Illustratorin Regina Cekaskin für die Zeichnungen der Kameras gewinnen, die uns schon in der Vergangenheit bei anderen Produkten wie unserer Baumwolltasche unterstützt hat. Um das Kartendesign kümmert sich Fotografin und Designerin Lisa-Marie Kaspar. Die beiden haben für diese Kampagne die ersten drei Karten gezeichnet sowie gestaltet und wir hoffen, Du bist von ihrer Arbeit genauso begeistert wie wir. Sobald die Finanzierung steht, werden sich die beiden an die Arbeit für die restlichen Karten machen.
 
 
Welche Vergleichswerte habt Ihr?
 


Erscheinungsjahr: Das jeweilige Erscheinungsjahr der Kameras.

Gewicht: Wieviel wiegt die Kamera? Diese Angabe steht häufig leider nicht in den alten Werbeanzeigen und Katalogen. Und wenn doch, wurde die Kamera mit oder ohne Objektiv, mit Prisma- oder Schachtsucher gewogen? Teilweise haben wir einige Kameras selbst auf die Waage gestellt oder Freund*innen, Bekannte und unsere Leser*innen dazu angestiftet.

Preis damals: Wieviel hat die Kamera an ihrem Erscheinungsjahr gekostet? Je nach Währung und Zeit ist dieser Wert nur schwer zu vergleichen. Wir haben deshalb die Angaben umgerechnet. Die Preise sind im deutschen Quartett in € (im englischen in USD) angegeben und entsprechen dem Wert, den die Kameras im Verhältnis zu den Lebenskosten hatten.

Preis heute: Wieviel kostet die Kamera heute? Wir haben uns Preise bei Auktionen und Second-Hand-Shops angesehen. Die Preise schwanken je nach Zustand und Glück der Käufer*innen zum Teil. Wir geben im Quartett den Durchschnittspreis einer gut erhaltenen und noch funktionstüchtigen Kamera an.

Google-Treffer: Dieser Punkt war in der Redaktion zugegeben der umstrittenste. Natürlich ist er sehr einfach zu ermitteln, aber darum geht es uns nicht allein. Die Anzahl der Google-Treffer verrät vor allem etwas über die Bekanntheit der Kameras.

Innovationswert: Hier möchten wir aufzeigen, wie wichtig die jeweilige Kamera für die Entwicklung der Kameratechnik war. Gab es bei den jeweiligen Modellen technische Neuerungen, die den Fortschritt der Fotografie vorangetrieben haben, dann bekommt die Kamera von uns einen höheren Innovationswert. Natürlich ist dieser zugegeben etwas subjektiv. Unsere Skala reicht von 1 bis 10.

<h3>Who I am...</h3>
<p>Hi I am Cristian! Or how some people that know me personally, Cris. 36 years young, and living in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>A couple of years a go I  took on the challenge to become a photographer and the journey has been amazing so far.  I have met some beautiful souls along the way, and I am sure I will meet plenty more. And of course create more beautiful images.</p>
<p>But to create more beautiful images a bigger budget helps. Helps me pay for film (I shoot mostly analog), places to sleep and eat, and sometimes safety.</p>
<p>Because unfortunately my tooth fairy jar is not infinite I started this! A print sale!</p>
<p>First my work was more street photography oriented, but now with the passing of time I am becoming more of a documentary photographer. My train of thought is; what good is a photograph if you don't know the story behind it.</p>
<p>So that means more talking, more getting to know the people on this beautiful globe. And who knows... Maybe my photographs will help create a better understanding for each other. And in the end, maybe even a better world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>​I have multiple projects that I am working on. Here in the Netherlands it is my project name Portrait series of the Soul: We are all human. I have got my Israel and Palestinian territories project named, Neshama Shei. But also very important. I am also preparing as we speak my new project in Myanmar (Birma).  And that is why I am organizing this print sale.</p>
<p>In Myanmar I found out about a tribe in the North which I want to visit. And of course, tell their story.  I can't wait to hop on the plane and go there.</p>
<p>The money I will earn during this print sale will be used as funding. Because the more funding I have the better stories I can tell.</p>
<p>Expenses always add up in the end. And it starts with the littlest things, like buying film, and developer. But also there are plenty of other costs. In the case of my upcoming project. Plane tickets. Places of stay. Food. More film. Transportation. A fixer (that is alike a super secret guide.).  And the list goes on and on...</p>
<p>What you will get of course is the beautiful print that you chose to order.</p>
<p>And of course a never ending appreciation to make more work possible.</p>
<p>After this year and more projects are completed I will look for a space again to exhibit work I made from all of my projects. So you will be a big part in making that happen. And that is awesome!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Future Projects.</h3>
<p>As you can see I have plenty of projects going on at the moment, but that does not mean I am sitting still afterwards.</p>
<p>Like I already mentioned, every little bit helps. And the more prints I sell the better. Because I am already planning my projects after that. I also am planning to go to Colombia. Back to work on my project in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Back to Iran. Hong Kong I absolutely will not forget. Venezuela and many more...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is not really a risk or something... Maybe the mailman gets robbed. But other than that... No. It really it nothing more than a print sale. So all my backers get the print anyway.</p>

</p><p><b>THE WHAT<br/>------------</b></p><p>At it's core, Phocus is a 
humanitarian photography project whose intention is to shine a light on 
the captivating stores and struggles of NGOs, charities, their members, 
their constituents, and those they are dedicated to helping and serving 
across the globe. </p><p>It's really all quite simple. I want to travel 
to regions that are seemingly forgotten, I want to help people that need
 it, and I want to create rich interactive digital publications with 
engaging images, video, and narratives as a means of sharing those 
stories. I will start with iOS publications and if I raise enough money will try to release an Android tablet version as well.<br/></p><p>The plan is to spend several weeks in Guatemala, return, 
produce and publish that book, and then launch another campaign to move 
onto the next location until I have covered the issues, struggles, and 
lives on every continent in an attempt to help introduce the rest of the
 world to…well…each other. <br/></p><p>I will begin with Guatemala due to the simple fact that over 50% of children in the country under 5 years old are chronically malnourished. It's the highest rate of malnutrition in Latin America, and the 4th highest rate in the world. <br/></p><p><b>THE WHY<br/>-----------</b></p><p>Today's
 technologies have introduced a wide array of entirely new delivery 
methods to an entirely new generation of people that are engaging with 
these delivery methods at a pace never before seen in any medium. One of
 the most exciting is the transformation that the publication business 
has undertaken over the past few years. What was traditionally words and
 pictures printed on static paper have evolved into so much more - 
pictures that literally come to life before you - stories being told by 
the very voices behind the faces in front of you.</p><p>This is precisely the medium in which I aim to deliver the Phocus series. </p><p>Through
 a continually updated blog and twitter feed, and ultimately, an 
interactive tablet photo book chalk full of rich imagery, engaging video
 and narratives in various forms, my aim is to utilize the resources 
available in today's incredible media landscape to capture and show and 
tell the heartwarming and inspiring stories of struggle, survival, and 
perseverance of some of our world's most valuable, yet 
under-appreciated, heroes. </p><p>And I feel I'm now in perfect position to do that. </p><p>I've
 founded, owned, run, written for, and worked for various publications, 
so I'm more than familiar with the processes ingrained within. 
I've created videos assets for Fortune 500 companies as well as 
non-profits, so I'm very versed in the languages of marketing and 
advertising and publicity.
I've managed to build considerable momentum in a career in photography 
over the past several years, so I'm more than proficient there.
And I've already helped create two prototype ebooks with interactive 
assets that have been received incredibly well, one as an educational 
curriculum, and one as a wellness based publication - 
	
		and it is precisely those experiences that made me see the incredibly 
promising potential these things have. The intuitive nature and rise of 
the tablet and mobile generation has opened up avenues that traditional 
print media couldn't even dream of just a short 5 years ago.</p><p>The 
past 3 years especially have seen INCREDIBLE strides in the world of 
multi-media publishing. With the advent of and the publics unprecedented
 embrace of tablets, the technologies and methods afforded to use 
between Apples iBooks and Adobe's Digital Publishing Suite, and the 
capabilities gifted to us in today's insanely versatile cameras, the 
timing and market is ripe and perfect for a project of this nature.</p><p>Look
 back over my body of work, especially when I was publishing Kotori Magazine, as well as my work with Earthtones.org, and you'll see that one thread that has 
survived all along the journey is the desire to experience first hand 
the daily issues that the majority of the world's populations are 
dealing with, and try to bridge that disconnect in emotional and 
universally beneficial ways.</p><p>The globe’s NGOs are too busy 
stretching every minute and penny that they have to affect the lives of 
the people they are so dedicated to helping, and consequently, 
they don't have the time, the resources or the money to bring the 
attention to their work that they need or that an independent effort is 
capable of doing for them. That's why I'd like to bring my skills and 
energies to them, to help them make their case and reveal to the viewer 
some of the most compelling and emotional stories the world has to 
offer, but has yet to hear.</p><p>The world needs these stories.</p><p>Essentially,
 what I hope to show is that while we all have struggles that are 
specific to our areas, we're all exactly the same. We all want, and 
need, the very same things, and we all share the very same dreams, 
hopes, and goals. Perhaps through a format in which we're not just

<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">URBAN SAINTS is a series of portrait photographs that I started in 2012. The idea was to meet and photograph beautiful inspiring women in a very specific iconic way, that not only showcases their charisma and personality but also draws attention to the beauty of urban architecture.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">These photos are very near and dear to my heart and in a way are the main reason I ever got involved in photography in the first place. It has given me the opportunity to interact with awesome people, create cool and lasting friendships, find inspiring and beautiful places and overall has been an amazing experience.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">My professional background is graphic design and branding and I had always had great passion and admiration for compelling photography. A few years ago, 5 to be exact, I was able to get my hands on a decent camera and so my journey into this unlimited area of inspiration began. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The URBAN SAINTS photo series was my first major attempt at creating something with a back-story and an overall specific theme. And now, 5 years later the time has come to try to bring this project to life and evolve from being just an online gallery to a real life item, that everyone can hold in their hands.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This has been a dream of mine for a long time and I finally decided to give this a try and with your precious help, I can achieve something that will be a fitting manifestation of something very important in my artistic and personal life.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The aim of this campaign is to create a unique and beautiful showcase in the form of a coffee-table photography book.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I want to create a very high-quality item and a book that does justice to the beauty that is portrayed in each of the photographs. I didn't want to make it too small, too flimsy and basically have something that will ""just do for now"". I wanted to make a classy and exquisite publication. High-quality paper, high-quality hardcover, and a size that lets the viewers take in all of the beauty and expression of each individual photograph.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The success of this campaign relies entirely on your contributions and support and if the intended figure is achieved I will do everything I can to make sure that the final product will be as awesome as the people that have helped me get here.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I will personally overview the print process and finishing procedures, I will personally sign, hand-package and ship every copy, to make sure that everything is carried out the right way.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">For the past five years, I have been able to reach over 120 photos in the series. And since I really want to display each and every one of them as a standalone piece of art, this made me decide on the number of the photos that will be included in the book. If this campaign is a success, I will make a second volume of this Project in the future with the next batch of photos.</p>

<h2>Какво е ГРАДСКИ СВЕТИЦИ?</h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Здравейте, аз съм Стефан Василев, графичен дизайнер и страстен фотограф. Винаги съм се вдъхновявал от красотата и нейния личен израз и съм вярвал, че всеки от нас притежава това специално качество, което въздейства и ни свързва с хората около нас.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Това е моят опит да уловя това.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487004141/ll8vxdw9rcqqgsmyzvt1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;"">ГРАДСКИ СВЕТИЦИ е серия от портретни фотографии, които започнах през 2012 г. Идеята ми беше да срещна и да заснема красиви и вдъхновяващи дами по специфичен и иконичен начин, който не само да покаже тяхната харизматичност и качества, но и да привлека внимание към красотата на заобикалящата ни градска архитектура.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;"">Тези кадри са много специални за мен и са една от причините въобще да се захвана с фотография. Покрай тях получих възможността да контактувам със страхотни хора, да създам дълготрайни приятелства, да открия красиви и вдъхновяващи места и като цяло да съм в центъра на едно невероятно преживяване.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487004170/g6lxicbxukudie7xega5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;"">Професията ми е графичен дизайн и брандинг и винаги винаги съм се възхищавал на въздействаща фотография. Преди няколко години, пет по-точно, успях да се сдобия с приличен фотоапарат и това постави началото на моето пътуване в тази необятна сфера.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;"">Серията ГРАДСКИ СВЕТИЦИ беше моят пръв опит да създам нещо с история и цялостна специфична тема. И сега, пет години по-късно, дойде моментът да вдъхна живот на този проект и да го развия от онлайн албум в реален жив предмет, който всеки може да вземе в ръцете си.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Това е моя дългогодишна мечта и с Вашата безценна подкрепа, искам да създам нещо, което да бъде подобаващ израз на една изключително важна част от моя личен и артистичен път.</p>

Не искам да направя книгата прекалена малка, прекалено тънка или с други думи да е нещо, което просто „става“. Моето желание е това да бъде луксозно и класно издание. Висококачествена хартия, твърди корици и размер, който да позволи на всеки, който я разлисти да усети максимално красотата на всеки кадър.</p>

ЗА ОПИСАНИЕ НА БЪЛГАРСКИ ЕЗИК - МОЛЯ ВИЖТЕ ПО-ДОЛУ
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
What is URBAN SAINTS?
 

 
URBAN SAINTS is a series of portrait photographs that I started in 2012. The idea was to meet and photograph beautiful inspiring women in a very specific iconic way, that not only showcases their charisma and personality but also draws attention to the beauty of urban architecture.
These photos are very near and dear to my heart and in a way are the main reason I ever got involved in photography in the first place. It has given me the opportunity to interact with awesome people, create cool and lasting friendships, find inspiring and beautiful places and overall has been an amazing experience.
 

 
My professional background is graphic design and branding and I had always had great passion and admiration for compelling photography. A few years ago, 5 to be exact, I was able to get my hands on a decent camera and so my journey into this unlimited area of inspiration began. 
The URBAN SAINTS photo series was my first major attempt at creating something with a back-story and an overall specific theme. And now, 5 years later the time has come to try to bring this project to life and evolve from being just an online gallery to a real life item, that everyone can hold in their hands.
This has been a dream of mine for a long time and I finally decided to give this a try and with your precious help, I can achieve something that will be a fitting manifestation of something very important in my artistic and personal life.
 

The Book
 

 
The aim of this campaign is to create a unique and beautiful showcase in the form of a coffee-table photography book.
I want to create a very high-quality item and a book that does justice to the beauty that is portrayed in each of the photographs. I didn't want to make it too small, too flimsy and basically have something that will ""just do for now"". I wanted to make a classy and exquisite publication. High-quality paper, high-quality hardcover, and a size that lets the viewers take in all of the beauty and expression of each individual photograph.
 
The book will be available for the listed price only during the length of the Indiegogo campaign.
 

 
These are the technical details of the book:

Size: A4 (210/297mm)
Number of pages: 128
High-quality hardcover
Number of photographs: 60
Body paper: Chrome White Paper 170g/sqm
Hardcover: 2.5 mm

 
The money will be used print production, finishing details, packaging, shipping costs, model royalties and last, but not least, arranging the launch party where I can meet everyone that has helped me turn this dream into reality (and also everyone that can and wants to come and say Hi). 
If the funding goal is not met, every backer will be refunded.
Shipment within Bulgaria is free. Shipment to the rest of the world is priced according to Bulgarian Post Pricing.

Stretch Goals
 
The original print run, that is set up for this campaign is 250 copies.
Additional to that I have planned a couple of extra goals/milestones that in terms of printing costs will allow me to add extra features to the book.
 
Stretch Goal #1 - 13 000 $
 

 
approx. 500 copies: I will be able to add a custom dust jacket for the URBAN SAINTS book. Every contributor will be able to choose the photograph that is printed on the cover from the overall selection, included in the book.
 
Stretch Goal #1 - 20 000 $
 

 
approx. 750 copies:  Additional to the custom dust jacket, I will add a customized A2 poster, printed on high-quality photo paper. Every contributor will be able to choose the photograph that is printed on the cover and the poster from the overall selection, included in the book.
 

Risks & Challenges
 
The success of this campaign relies entirely on your contributions and support and if the intended figure is achieved I will do everything I can to make sure that the final product will be as awesome as the people that have helped me get here.
I will personally overview the print process and finishing procedures, I will personally sign, hand-package and ship every copy, to make sure that everything is carried out the right way.
For the past five years, I have been able to reach over 120 photos in the series. And since I really want to display each and every one of them as a standalone piece of art, this made me decide on the number of the photos that will be included in the book. If this campaign is a success, I will make a second volume of this Project in the future with the next batch of photos.
 

Other Ways You Can Help Me
 
Don't hesitate to use the Indiegogo share tools and forward this to everyone that in your opinion will be interested and intrigued by this book. 
 

 
I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart for the support, not only in sharing and contributing but also to those of you who were with me for all these years.

Какво е ГРАДСКИ СВЕТИЦИ?
 
Здравейте, аз съм Стефан Василев, графичен дизайнер и страстен фотограф. Винаги съм се вдъхновявал от красотата и нейния личен израз и съм вярвал, че всеки от нас притежава това специално качество, което въздейства и ни свързва с хората около нас.
 
Това е моят опит да уловя това.
 

 
ГРАДСКИ СВЕТИЦИ е серия от портретни фотографии, които започнах през 2012 г. Идеята ми беше да срещна и да заснема красиви и вдъхновяващи дами по специфичен и иконичен начин, който не само да покаже тяхната харизматичност и качества, но и да привлека внимание към красотата на заобикалящата ни градска архитектура.
 
Тези кадри са много специални за мен и са една от причините въобще да се захвана с фотография. Покрай тях получих възможността да контактувам със страхотни хора, да създам дълготрайни приятелства, да открия красиви и вдъхновяващи места и като цяло да съм в центъра на едно невероятно преживяване.
 

 
Професията ми е графичен дизайн и брандинг и винаги винаги съм се възхищавал на въздействаща фотография. Преди няколко години, пет по-точно, успях да се сдобия с приличен фотоапарат и това постави началото на моето пътуване в тази необятна сфера.
Серията ГРАДСКИ СВЕТИЦИ беше моят пръв опит да създам нещо с история и цялостна специфична тема. И сега, пет години по-късно, дойде моментът да вдъхна живот на този проект и да го развия от онлайн албум в реален жив предмет, който всеки може да вземе в ръцете си.
Това е моя дългогодишна мечта и с Вашата безценна подкрепа, искам да създам нещо, което да бъде подобаващ израз на една изключително важна част от моя личен и артистичен път.
 


Книгата
 

 
Целта на тази кампания е създам уникално и красиво представяне на проекта под формата на настолна фотокнига.
Моето желание е тя да бъде висококачествен продукт, който подобаващо да показва красотата на всяка една от снимките. Не искам да направя книгата прекалена малка, прекалено тънка или с други думи да е нещо, което просто „става“. Моето желание е това да бъде луксозно и класно издание. Висококачествена хартия, твърди корици и размер, който да позволи на всеки, който я разлисти да усети максимално красотата на всеки кадър.
 
Книгата ще бъда налична на посочената цена само и единствено през кампанията в Indiegogo .
 

 
Технически характеристики :

Размер: A4 (210/297mm)
Брой страници: 128
Висококачествена твърда корица
Брой фотографии: 60
Хартия за тялото: Chrome White Paper 170g/sqm
Дебелина на корицата: 2.5 mm

 
Парите ще бъдат използвани за печат, довършителни работи, опаковане, транспорт, разплащане с моделите и не на последно място организиране на парти, на което мога да се приветствам всички, които са ме подкрепили в реализирането на тази моя мечта (и всеки, който иска просто да дойде за да каже „Здравей“). 
Ако зададената финансова цел на проекта не бъде постигната, сумите преведени от всеки, подкрепил кампанията, ще бъдат възстановени изцяло .
Доставката на територията на България е безплатна. Доставката за всяка друга държава е зададена според цената на Български Национални Пощи.

<h3> </h3>
<p>My name is Carlos Mario Argüello, I'm Colombian and this is my history.</p>
<p>4 years ago I started working with self-taught photography, I've never studied or taken any courses. I've read to followed my eye to into what to take pictures of.</p>
<p>This everything started while ago, I had the chance to have a camera in my hands and immediately I felt that I found myself.</p>
<p>The feeling at this moment moves into photography.</p>
<p>Part of this feeling into my missionary work took me 5 years, visiting the farmer trails and farms, joining them at the dinner table, at the same time I was just offering my whole to listen to what happened to each of them. Their pain, suffering, frustrations, happiness, their silences, those were the most vivid portraits I took. This is the reason why my soul now feels complete.</p>
<p>After the trip it keeps on my mind to bittersweet feeling of capturing what I felt and how I had to live. But also remains on me an enormous weight on my back, the weight of give and share What I experienced with the others, to show what I've seen before, to let my self show my inner battles, lots of them failed with some winnings , giving the people what I have to tell, what I secretly scream or keep silent, letting my sight show its point, my wounds and scars, my own words, my heartbeats, and my deepest soul.</p>
<p>For this I had to start with something, then I started working on my website but I felt I had to go even further, merging all my work into a book. This is why I need your help! I want to share the world all my experiences into a printed book, to improve my photographer career and spread knowledge to the world. You have two options if you want to help me to get my goal.

All the money collected will be for releasing 1.000 book copys with 200 of my photography diaries. I will be greatful if you can support me. </p>
<p>If you donate U$100 or more + shipping, you can  get 20% off the book, also a picture,  10 x 15 cm (0.39 x 5.9 inches) with a personal message on the back.</p>

One day, while changing the filters on my camera, I realized I could get the same view if I had a way to wear them. Also sunglasses just never seemed to provide the right tint or shade I wanted.

FilterSpecs allow you the freedom to enhance your perspective by customizing the way you want to see the world. Feeling sad? Throw on a pair of amber filters. Bothered by that pesky glare. Polarizing filters should do the trick! Sad about that glare? Why not amber filters and polarizers! It’s really that simple. You can stack filters to get darker or lighter variations of colors. You can Mix Colors. You can get two variable neutral density filters and have a tint level you can adjust to changing light conditions. Want the best optical quality possible? With FilterSpecs the sky is the limit with hundreds of filters on the market.

<p><strong>Metropolight</strong></p>
<p>In 2015, I walked over 3600 kilometres through some of the world's most metropolitan areas, photographing people in cities such as New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, London or Seoul. Despite how physically close to each other people in large cities work, commute and live together, the general attitude among its populations has increasingly been a one of hesitation and reluctance. I believe this is because cities alienate its people. The modern city needs to be a functional and well-organised space. At it's core, it is rooted in reason and factual knowledge. As an effect, the emotional concerns of people living cities are often pushed aside and deemed as distractive to the smooth functioning of the city.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488495632/q9iytmg708m0qwce0dxf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In this book, I wanted to explore the emotional charge, or lack thereof, of the 21st century metropolis. I am not interested in individual cities as much as I am intrigued by the ways the almost clinically sterile urban environment structures our lives and shapes our experience. Many of the photos in the book have been taken in business districts that exemplify spaces rooted in rationality and individual achievement.</p>
<p>The city exercises a homogenizing power over its people. The continuous shift towards a quantifiable and objective existence creates a tension in those who live in the city. The urban tendencies towards indifference and a reserved attitude are a manifest of a struggle to maintain personal space where individuals can harbour their unique and complex personalities. Hopefully, the book is a record of this struggle; of what the city moulds us into, and how we try to remain authentic to ourselves at the same time.</p>

<p>The city becomes an intimately familiar setting, which David understands well. He is able to pause a moment when five people in close proximity are each engaged in a different activity, each sealed shut in their own world, yet sharing a common space which forever connects their existences in a fleeting second.

<p><strong>ESSAY</strong></p>
<p>Things pass in front of them quickly like dynasties of mites, but they only capture their shadows. Their journey, however often it may cross the same stations and go past the same narrow corridors, is far from over. Each of them separately nurtures a guide, a spectre. For any passing wall or unexpected curvature of shapes could reopen that sidewalk, a space outside of daily machinery and a pocket of time outside of their precisely calibrated watch. The tired look that was worked by the city flow like a waterfall’s bedrock reignites with fervour. - Alex Jasiński poet &amp; author.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Kat and I'm a Photography graduate who has discovered a newfound inspiration in an unfortunate tragedy. I'd like to share a story with you about a dear friend I lost on June 22nd, 2012:</p>
<p>When I went to school for photography, I had the opportunity to meet one of the most wonderful people one could ever meet. His name was Brye. Brye wasn't exactly one of the most extroverted, loud people but he was one of the most gentle souls I ever came across. We bonded over photography classes and lunch breaks. We would share our photographic fears and our dreams for our future. I wanted to move to New York and he wanted to move to California. At the end of last year, he was able to move to California to be with his fiancee, Kim. When it was my birthday, Brye sent me a letter along with a drawing that contained two characters, one holding a balloon.</p>
<p>Once Brye moved to California, he became increasingly sick. He began to experience painful migraines to the point he was unable to walk. Unbeknownst to me, he had been suffering from Lupus ever since he was 16. On June 22nd, I was delivered some unfortunate news by Kim that Brye had passed away due to complications of Lupus. He was only 23.</p>
<p>My campaign is a photographic project I have labeled ""The Purple Balloon Project"". The color purple is associated with Lupus. When I heard this terrible news, I wanted to be able to help out. I felt inspired to pursue a project where I would be able to help out others suffering from Lupus with the hopes of a cure someday.</p>
<p>I would like to start a photographic series containing subjects holding a purple balloon in natural light. The purpose of this series is to raise awareness of Lupus and serve as an homage to my dear friend, Brye. This project will be a joint effort along with a documentary that will be produced by Brye's fiancee, Kim.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to be able to bring ""The Purple Balloon Project"" to life, I am asking for help in funding some of the equipment to be able to photograph the best possible ideas. At the moment, the camera that I use presents some limitations for the type of project I would like to do. I am looking to begin shooting ""The Purple Balloon Project"" in August.</p>
<p>I'm asking for a funding fee of $5,000 to cover some of the following:<br/><br/>-Canon f/4 24-105 mm USM</p>
</div>
<div>Because this project is on a ""Fixed"" funding schedule, our goal of $5000 must be met in order to continue with this project. About 80% of the funding will be donated to the Lupus Foundation of America (Philadelphia Tri-State Chapter). Please help us get there. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Alas, if our goal is not reached within 45 days, I will still pursue ""The Purple Balloon Project"" with my limited resources.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In exchange for your generosity, the following perks will be delivered to you via mail once the project is completed (please make sure you click on ""Claim this Perk"" and not just ""Contribute"" if you'd like a perk)</div>
<div>:</div>

</div></div>","My Story
Hi,
My name is Kat and I'm a Photography graduate who has discovered a newfound inspiration in an unfortunate tragedy. I'd like to share a story with you about a dear friend I lost on June 22nd, 2012:
When I went to school for photography, I had the opportunity to meet one of the most wonderful people one could ever meet. His name was Brye. Brye wasn't exactly one of the most extroverted, loud people but he was one of the most gentle souls I ever came across. We bonded over photography classes and lunch breaks. We would share our photographic fears and our dreams for our future. I wanted to move to New York and he wanted to move to California. At the end of last year, he was able to move to California to be with his fiancee, Kim. When it was my birthday, Brye sent me a letter along with a drawing that contained two characters, one holding a balloon.
Once Brye moved to California, he became increasingly sick. He began to experience painful migraines to the point he was unable to walk. Unbeknownst to me, he had been suffering from Lupus ever since he was 16. On June 22nd, I was delivered some unfortunate news by Kim that Brye had passed away due to complications of Lupus. He was only 23.
My campaign is a photographic project I have labeled ""The Purple Balloon Project"". The color purple is associated with Lupus. When I heard this terrible news, I wanted to be able to help out. I felt inspired to pursue a project where I would be able to help out others suffering from Lupus with the hopes of a cure someday.
I would like to start a photographic series containing subjects holding a purple balloon in natural light. The purpose of this series is to raise awareness of Lupus and serve as an homage to my dear friend, Brye. This project will be a joint effort along with a documentary that will be produced by Brye's fiancee, Kim.
 


What We Need & What You Get
In order to be able to bring ""The Purple Balloon Project"" to life, I am asking for help in funding some of the equipment to be able to photograph the best possible ideas. At the moment, the camera that I use presents some limitations for the type of project I would like to do. I am looking to begin shooting ""The Purple Balloon Project"" in August.
I'm asking for a funding fee of $5,000 to cover some of the following:-Canon f/4 24-105 mm USM

Because this project is on a ""Fixed"" funding schedule, our goal of $5000 must be met in order to continue with this project. About 80% of the funding will be donated to the Lupus Foundation of America (Philadelphia Tri-State Chapter). Please help us get there. 
 
Alas, if our goal is not reached within 45 days, I will still pursue ""The Purple Balloon Project"" with my limited resources.
 
In exchange for your generosity, the following perks will be delivered to you via mail once the project is completed (please make sure you click on ""Claim this Perk"" and not just ""Contribute"" if you'd like a perk)
:
$5 - Personalized Thank You note via mail (unlimited)
$10 - Thank You note + 4x6 print (100 available)
$20 - Thank You note + 4x6 print + 5x7 print (50 available)$50 - Thank You note + 4x6 print + 5x7 print + 8x10 print (30 available)$100 - Thank You note + 4x6 print + 5x7 print + 2 8x10 prints (10 available)
$250 - Thank You note + 4x6 print + 5x7 print + 2 8x10 prints + Photo Book
(5 available)
 
 
*NOTE: I apologize ahead of time but I cannot ship internationally!
 

The Impact
Any contribution would mean the world to me. First, you're helping to raise awareness of Lupus as a disease. Two, you're helping me raise funds in order to be able to bring my project to light. Most importantly, you're showing me you've read the story about Brye.

MA, I spent several years honing my craft as an event and sports 
photographer. With each event, I found that my best shots were always 
the ones that captured the personal, private moments of the subjects - 
each frame telling a specific story that could bring them back to not 
only a place in time, but a place of mind. As I pushed myself, I strove 
to not only create pretty pictures but those that exposed the inner-life
 of the subjects, while at the same time, revealed a larger-than-life 
nature of the event.  My career then evolved into creating advertising 
and lifestyle photography, shooting both in-studio and on location, for a
 wide variety of clientele.</p>
<p>I was ecstatic when I learned of a process to convert my photographs 
into translucent 3D-prints. I quickly realized the potential there-in,

With this, we can expand the small photography studio into something new and exciting to offer our clients. We are constantly thinking of new ways to combine the two worlds of photography and 3D printing and we can't wait to implement and develop more. These products are an example of what we can offer when we are 
able to afford a professional 3D printer. If our project is successful, 
we will be able to make this purchase. </p>
<p>We'd also like to continue the development of our product. The true beauty of Topografic™ prints is 
revealed when you view them in front of a light, whether it is in front 
of a window or an artificial source. With your funding, we are also going to 
be pursuing the development our patent pending idea of creating an 
artificial light source embedded into the frame. We believe that this 
will greatly enhance the range of enjoyment and flexibility of your 
topografic print.</p>
<p>This project is a fixed funding campaign. 
Since our first goal is to get a 3D printer, we need to cover those 
costs. Hopefully we can raise more than our goal to continue our 
development.</p></span><h1><span class=""notranlsate""><h2>what we are offering:</h2></span></h1>

<span class=""notranlsate""><h3>Topografics™</h3>
<p>Topografics™ are 
personalized 3D-printed photographs
 that have revolutionized the way we experience our favorite images. 
These are printed on high resolution 3D-printers from STL files, which 
have been converted from traditional photographs. Using specific preset 
parameters, Studio DTW is able to ensure that your print will look 
incredible. Adding the sense of touch, Topografics™ give you a fully 
immersive viewing experience.  With these prints, not only are you 
viewing your favorite 
memories, but you can feel the texture, and see it come to life over and
 over.</p>
<p>The great thing about 3D-printing is its on-demand 
production. No need to make molds, assembly lines or any of that 
old-school business. We are diving head first into the exciting world of
 Rapid Prototyping and Additive Manufacturing. We already have a local 
company in place to help us develop all of these 100% unique and 
customized prints. This means that your digital photo gets sent to us, 
processed, printed, packed (all around Providence, RI) and shipped back to
 you. We are really hoping to nail down a local manufacturer for our 
frames as well, but we are still searching for the perfect fit.</p>

<ul>
<li>We, basically two friends from Melbourne Australia run a small social media marketing company and always find difficult to get good photos to use in our projects for a reasonable price. Most of the big stock images sites costs a lot and as we serve small businesses, we do not have a budget to purchase expensive photos. So, Gregory my friend clicks natural meaningful photographs catering small business needs and we give them away for free. We usually go out on Sundays to photograph and help others this way.</li>
<li>We came to indiegogo to ask for help, as we are small startup and do not have enough money to fund hosting, travel and management costs for this startup. We want to start slow and grow this community slowly. We have 10 photographers around the World on-board with 15,000 images ready to go live, but we need good servers and development cost to get this up and running.</li>
<li>Once the project is completed, all the supporters will get instant access to our library with special pack of 500 photos exclusive to supporters. We want to create a free online world with free beautiful meaningful images.</li>

<p>Let us introduce our
project and ourselves, We are <b>K+A</b>: </p>
<p><b>K</b>ira
– photographer-inventor, which reveals the inner world of people through
photography and images. She is the K. </p>
<p><b>+</b></p>
<p><b>A</b>rtem
- writer and journalist who writes about photo sessions, adventures and other
activities of K+A. He trying to get to know people, and to convey their essence
through conversations, surveys and articles. He is the A.</p>
<p><b>If you wish to learn more about us, we will be always
glad to see you, at The universe of K+A: </b><a href=""http://www.kirartem.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kirartem.com</a><b><a href=""http://www.kirartem.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></b></p>
<p>We believe that
every person is unique and beautiful in his own way. We believe in this, even
when the person don’t believe. In each photo article, we try to convey a unique
story of a person, his inner world, or his state of mind.  </p>
<p>We are always very
carefully treat to each person, and we always co-ordinate every aspect of our
work with that person. To each person we use an individual approach.</p>
<p>With somebody, we
can spend many hours of conversation, but to someone conversation will seem
superfluous, and only in front of the camera he can convey his true inner
world, without further ado...</p>
<p>For several years
of our work, we met many different people, including twins. And we became very
interested, what is the essence lies behind persons, which looks very similar. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>We worked with
several twins, they told us about their life, about relations to each other,
about how they see this world and much more. We photographed them, and always
tried to convey their true essence, to convey which they really are. We met
different pairs of twins, which were friendly on each other, and not exactly,
worked with the twins, who tried to show that they are the one integrated
entity, and with some twins, which more liked to show personality of each
other. Also, we made personal interviews for the twins and conducted the survey
with each twin, separately from each other, for explore the point of view, of
each twin, and then compared their results. For each pair of twins, we came up
with unique, appropriate to them, questions based on their relationships,
temperament, lifestyle... As a result, we created amazing photo articles with
the twins.</p>

<br/>
<p>Before we start
working with the twins, we couldn’t have imagined how interesting and amazing
this experience. We would like to share this experience with the world! That is
why we decided to create our project <b>“Among Twins”</b>!!!</p>
<p>In <b>“Among
Twins.Europe”</b>, we will try to visit as much as possible countries of Europe, to
meet there as much as possible twins, and at last to know the answer to a
question of the whole world: “Who are the twins?” It is our first project <b>“Among
Twins”</b>, and as it is clear of the word Europe, we are going to visit in our
first project some countries in Europe, and with the twins from the each
country we will create amazing a photo article. </p>
<p>From you, dear
friend, will depend, number of the countries which we will visit in Europe, and
respectively, and number of twins. (How exactly you can help us, you can learn
below, in the section ""Help us""). The end result, will be the awesome
<b>Photobook ""Among Twins.Europe""</b>, which we ,with pleasure will, share
with you, after you purchase one of our perk. </p>

Yes, it is our first
big project, and yes it will pass in Europe, but it doesn't mean that, having
finished this project we will stop on it, in independence of success of this
project, we want to visit as much as possible countries of the world, and to
depict as much as possible twins in our photo articles. Therefore, we need your
help. Let's create this project together! You are the irreplaceable member of
our <b>team</b>. Yes, <b>TEAM</b>, everyone who will help us by anything, that already part

<p>Our plans
are very great. The most priority task for us is to share with you and with the
whole world, our works.  Therefore, our
way is difficult.  Almost half of our
expenses will account to the manufacture of our products for you and all other contributors.
And since almost half of this amount will be spent on gifts for you, we will
remain the sum which, according to our calculations, will last only for three
countries that we can visit in Europe, this countries is: Poland, Germany and
Czech Republic. But, as we already wrote, all in your hands. We create this
project together, and we very much hope for your support. From number of the
gained sum, will depend the number of the countries and number of twins. Each
gathered $10000, over ours goal, will add on 2-3 countries, in our list of a
trip, and at least on 2-3 pairs of twins. We thought of adding electronic
versions of our photobooks to our productions, in this way we could reduce our
expenses, but we refused at once this idea. Expenses. We are ready on any
expenses, only in order that each contributor could hold before himself our
photobook and could behold essence of twins, to see that we saw, to feel that
energy, those feelings which we felt, being <b>Among Twins.</b></p>

Let us introduce our
project and ourselves, We are K+A: 
Kira
– photographer-inventor, which reveals the inner world of people through
photography and images. She is the K. 
+
Artem
- writer and journalist who writes about photo sessions, adventures and other
activities of K+A. He trying to get to know people, and to convey their essence
through conversations, surveys and articles. He is the A.
If you wish to learn more about us, we will be always
glad to see you, at The universe of K+A: www.kirartem.com
We believe that
every person is unique and beautiful in his own way. We believe in this, even
when the person don’t believe. In each photo article, we try to convey a unique
story of a person, his inner world, or his state of mind.  
We are always very
carefully treat to each person, and we always co-ordinate every aspect of our
work with that person. To each person we use an individual approach.
With somebody, we
can spend many hours of conversation, but to someone conversation will seem
superfluous, and only in front of the camera he can convey his true inner
world, without further ado...
For several years
of our work, we met many different people, including twins. And we became very
interested, what is the essence lies behind persons, which looks very similar. 




We worked with
several twins, they told us about their life, about relations to each other,
about how they see this world and much more. We photographed them, and always
tried to convey their true essence, to convey which they really are. We met
different pairs of twins, which were friendly on each other, and not exactly,
worked with the twins, who tried to show that they are the one integrated
entity, and with some twins, which more liked to show personality of each
other. Also, we made personal interviews for the twins and conducted the survey
with each twin, separately from each other, for explore the point of view, of
each twin, and then compared their results. For each pair of twins, we came up
with unique, appropriate to them, questions based on their relationships,
temperament, lifestyle... As a result, we created amazing photo articles with
the twins.




Before we start

We love travelling and we would like to share our passion and joy with people we meet on the road. We are starting our journey at the beginning of this campaign during which we plan to give way photos taken by Fuji Instax cameras and remind people of the feeling of holding the photos in their hands.Digital cameras might promise to store all our photos effortlessly. However, photos are taken, saved and forgotten somewhere among many other files on our computers. We would like to get back to basics - one shot, one original photo and a lot of happiness.We have given out more than 100 photos and saw what joy can one photo bring. And the best thing about it? It costs less than one beer to make someone happy. What do we need and what will you get in return? We have the cameras, some money for travelling and also some film cassettes. We don’t need much and we’ve learnt to travel for a bare minimum. Nevertheless, we need a lot more film cassettes in order to give away as many photos as possible. After deducting the costs of films we will be left with 2000 euros for 4 people for 2 months (250 euro per person per month).  If you bought us a “beer”, it would cover our expenses of giving away photo to one person and a little patch for travelling around Europe. If we manage to raise 3000€, we will visit the capital cities of EU (except for Cyprus and Malta) including Switzerland and Norway. Not to mention many other cities that we visit on our road. We will give away photos of people and places while traveling or send them to the address you provide us. This way, we can make your friend or just a random person happy.We will post our photos, observations and traveling updates online at whowantsaphotonow.com and on our facebook. We will also inform you about our actual whereabouts and where we are heading to, so we can meet with you. We would like to meet every single one of you and if it is possible, take a photo of your desire. We would like to meet you for a coffee or grab a beer with you and talk about our traveling and shooting experience. We will love to give you tips for good places to visit and tricks on how to travel low cost. TargetsReaching each target, will prolong our travels by half a year.3000€ - Photo shooting in the EU+Switzerland+Norway. 2-4 months. We will start taking photos 2 weeks after achieving 3000 EUR goal. We will take pictures mostly in capital cities and other cities on our planned route. We will give away the photos mainly to your friends, fellow travellers who we meet and also to the fans at music festivals.10000€ - Photo shooting will take place in the whole Europe. We will give away photos mainly to children and families in less developed regions. (We can also visit some nursing facilities or any other non-profit organizations).20000€ - We will add 10 more countries in North Africa and East Asia.30000€ - We will add 10 more countries in Southeast Asia.40000€ - We will add 10 states in North and Central America.50000€ - We will add 10 more countries in South America.100000€ - We can take photos and give them away in more than 90% of the countries in the world.Risks & ChallengesWe travelled around Europe many times and we always did pretty well (nobody got harmed in any way, nor robbed). We can’t influence natural disasters and don’t want to predict small wounds but there’s gonna be more of us in the terrain so the risks will be spread. Instax photos are a good quality and trustworthy product.The second risk is related to the vendor of negatives. We could face distributing issues and troubles with supply. We will try to have a stockpile of negatives at hand and we will deal with other prospective problems operatively.We are starting right nowYou can find us in June and July at these places:Hove Festival, Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, Bodø, Tromsø, Stockholm, Malmö, Roskilde Festival, Pohoda Festival, Reggae Geel Festival, Copenhagen, and Amsterdam.After we reach our goal, we will be able to start shooting around these locations:Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany, Thailand, specifically Lowlands Festival, Rotterdam, Helsinki, Brussels, Luxembourg City, Paris, London, Dublin, Hamburg, Munich, Berlin, and Bangkok.When the campaign is finished, we will be travelling in the following countries:Spain, Portugal, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.And many more!

Meine Leidenschaft ist es, Menschen zu zeigen, die nicht dem Schönheitsideal entsprechen, aber genauso schön sind. Zu klein, zu dick, zu dünn, mit Narben oder zu bunt; es gibt nichts was es nicht gibt.<br/></p>
<p>Aufgrund einer Bilderaktion mit Dr. Mark Benecke, Kriminalbiologe und bekannt durch viele TV-Sendungen, wurden die Nachfragen nach einem Kalender mit Tattoomodels die keine Modelmaße haben oder Makel wie Narben ect., so enorm, dass mein Kopfkino in Gang kam und ja, wir sollten uns jedes Jahr und 365 Tage im Jahr daran erinnern, das jeder von uns schön sein kann.</p>
<p>Ihr könnt es ermöglichen, dass wir einen Kalender erstellen, in dem tätowierte Menschen  zu sehen sein werden, die aussehen wie du und ich, egal, welche Kleidergröße sie tragen, egal, wie lang ihre Beine sind und egal, was sie sonst noch besonders macht. Alter spielt keine Rolle, Religion spielt keine Rolle und auch sonst gibt es keine Formen, denn der Kalender soll uns zeigen als das, was wir sind, nämlich Menschen.</p>
<p>Wenn wir das Finanzierungsziel erreichen, werden Dr. Mark Benecke und ich einen Tag in einem Kölner Fotostudio Shootings mit Euch machen (Termin und Ort werden nach Erreichen des Finanzierungsziels noch bekannt gegeben)<br/></p>
<p>Jeder kann sich bewerben und wir schauen, das wir einen bunten Mix von allen für den Kalender aussuchen, um eben unsere Gesellschaft widerzuspiegeln. <br/></p>
<p>Die ausgesuchten Personen werden dann von mir fotografiert, erhalten drei Bilder aus dem Shooting als Datei für sich, und eins dieser Fotos wird für den Kalender verwendet.<br/></p>
<p>Mit eurer Unterstützung sind die Kosten zur Erstellung des Kalenders komplett abgedeckt. Das Studio, das Layout, der Druck des Kalenders mit allem Drum und Dran. Dr. Mark Benecke möchte für diesen Tag kein Geld und freut sich einfach, das Projekt mit seiner Person unterstützen zu können.<br/></p>
<p>Mit eurer Unterstützung könnt ihr euch z.B. schon einen Kalender sichern oder eine Person eurer Wahl wird auf jeden Fall mit im Kalender abgedruckt.<br/></p>
<p>Niemand sollte sich verstecken müssen und niemand sollte sich schämen müssen. Die Gesellschaft ist kunterbunt und so sollten wir uns auch zeigen dürfen. <br/></p>
<p>Selbst große Tattoo-Zeitungen weigern sich, Mädels ab Kleidergröße 40 zu zeigen. Laßt uns trotzdem zeigen, wie schön wir alle sind. <br/></p>

Mit eurer Unterstützung sind die Kosten zur Erstellung des Kalenders komplett abgedeckt. Das Studio, das Layout, der Druck des Kalenders mit allem Drum und Dran. Dr. Mark Benecke möchte für diesen Tag kein Geld und freut sich einfach, das Projekt mit seiner Person unterstützen zu können.
Mit eurer Unterstützung könnt ihr euch z.B. schon einen Kalender sichern oder eine Person eurer Wahl wird auf jeden Fall mit im Kalender abgedruckt.
Niemand sollte sich verstecken müssen und niemand sollte sich schämen müssen. Die Gesellschaft ist kunterbunt und so sollten wir uns auch zeigen dürfen. 
Selbst große Tattoo-Zeitungen weigern sich, Mädels ab Kleidergröße 40 zu zeigen. Laßt uns trotzdem zeigen, wie schön wir alle sind. 

Wir müssen uns gemeinsam stärken, um zu sehen, wie schön wir sind.Nicht jeder hat die finanziellen Möglichkeiten, das Projekt zu unterstützen, aber jeder kann helfen, in dem ihr euern Freunden davon erzählt, das Projekt teilt und z.B auf Facebook Werbung dafür macht.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<span>Hi, I’m Julian Latif, an LA based photographer from Jakarta, Indonesia. I came to Los Angeles in 2010 to go to college. I have been interested in photography since I was a kid and it had become more and more apparent as I grew up. So, I decided to pursue a degree in that field. Studying photography at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena has been an eye-opening experience for me. It revealed so many things that have deepened my affection for photography, film camera in particular. That is why I mainly shoot with film, because I just love the genuine and raw details that no digital cameras could ever catch. As I just graduated a few of months ago, I planned on going back home to Indonesia and continue my career path there. So here am I, spending my last year here in LA doing things that I thought would prepare me for the real world, including this project that I am about to explain further below.</span><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p> </div><div><span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459513658/Untitled-1_qnzwf7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></div><div><span><p><i>                                          Jon Cozart, Brizzy Voices and Luke Korns</i><br/></p></span></div> <div> <h3><span>BTW If you get the early bird price, the book will be delivered to your door early June, which means you can bring it to VIDCON (June 23rd) to ask for signatures from each of the YouTuber on their portraits!</span></h3>

<p>“Red Play Book” is dedicated to all the people who are involved in it and all their fans; not to mention those who just have interest and passion in arts and photography like I do. I love to shoot real people, not just models. Like these YouTubers, there are no masks, filters, that keep me from finding their emotion.

<p><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>Dhanbad is called the ""Capital of Coal"" and is located in Jharkhand state in northern India. Coal is mined everywhere, and large parts are sorted by hand by people who once had land and houses, and lived in villages that now have become big black pits. Many have been forced away from these areas when companies and authorities recognized the richness that hides in the ground. The underground fires force people to relocate. The mining companies claim they are unable to put out the fires while the local people blame the companies for letting the fires burn so the coal can be reached and excavated from underneath the villages.</p>
<p>BLACK DIAMOND is about the environmental aspects of fossil fuel usage and it is also a close portrait of the people who work with extracting it from the ground. The photographs show the coal mining and the everyday lives of coal workers and miners in India.</p>
<p>There is a fragile balance between nature and mankind. The human inability to break patterns is painstakingly visible in these photographs, as we knowingly keep on extracting the ground beneath our own feet. Energy produced by the burning of coal is the single biggest contributor to the carbon dioxide emissions generated by human kind. Coal is a major part in the issue of global warming.</p>
<p><strong>THE BOOK</strong></p>
<p>BLACK DIAMOND will be a high quality hardcover photo book with printed cover and 112 pages containing 42 photographs including 5 double fold-out pages (left and right). The book will go to print in October/November 2018. It will be published and designed by German Kehrer Verlag.</p>

<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave, is wedged between Poland, Lithuania and the Baltic Sea. You must cross over 800km and pass through both Lithuania and Belarus to get to 'Big Russia.' It is this geographic isolation of being neither a part of Europe, nor being physically connected to motherland that gives this area its uniqueness. Kaliningrad’s history has been fraught with great transformations from its beginnings. It was once known as Konigsberg, a major city of Prussia, until 1944 when the Red Army invaded and the German and Lithuanian population fled or were killed. Those who live here tell me how, to the rural and the poor of Russia, Stalin proclaimed, '</span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">Come to Konigsberg - choose your home and build your city</span><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">.' Then came the cold war and with its strategic military position and containing the Baltic Fleet, the region was closed to foreigners and only open to certain eminent Russians. It was not until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 that it re-opened. The independence of Lithuania and Latvia severed Kaliningrad from Russia and has left the region in the fragile position of being an exclave of Russia and an enclave of the EU.</span></p>

The view of this faded garden explodes my mind and I get paralyzed, I have no clue how to move two legs, let alone a thousand. - Natasha
Neither is an exploration into the hearts of young women in Kaliningrad. The first generation to have grown up after the collapse of the Soviet Union, they look to define their identity in this small 'island' within Europe. The women I have been living with and sharing with have generously opened up their homes and their minds to allow me to better understand this link between place, identity and history.
This project that has been such a large part of my life over the last few years is now at its final stage. Having changed and grown with the support of many, I finally feel like I'm getting a chance to give a voice to the amazing women that I spent so much time with bringing me into their homes, telling me of their dreams and fears. This book is a dedication to their strength and I hope you will help me realize their stories.
Winner of the Alliance Francaise Photography Prize

History
Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave, is wedged between Poland, Lithuania and the Baltic Sea. You must cross over 800km and pass through both Lithuania and Belarus to get to 'Big Russia.' It is this geographic isolation of being neither a part of Europe, nor being physically connected to motherland that gives this area its uniqueness. Kaliningrad’s history has been fraught with great transformations from its beginnings. It was once known as Konigsberg, a major city of Prussia, until 1944 when the Red Army invaded and the German and Lithuanian population fled or were killed. Those who live here tell me how, to the rural and the poor of Russia, Stalin proclaimed, 'Come to Konigsberg - choose your home and build your city.' Then came the cold war and with its strategic military position and containing the Baltic Fleet, the region was closed to foreigners and only open to certain eminent Russians. It was not until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 that it re-opened. The independence of Lithuania and Latvia severed Kaliningrad from Russia and has left the region in the fragile position of being an exclave of Russia and an enclave of the EU.

Book
This work became very much a collaborative project as I built close relationships with Natasha, Olga, Jenya, Anastasyia etc. With the need to establish their power within this project, I have worked continuously with the women to edit the work and contribute their texts and ideas. Being able to effectively give a voice to them has always been difficult to realize within the gallery space but needed to be completed within the book form. Over the last six months I have been working with the internationally renowned Dutch designer -SYB- to create the book. Using eyewitness accounts of women who first arrived in Kaliningrad in 1945, and handwritten diary entries of contemporary women, the book works to establish their voices within this project. These personal stories in conjunction with my images, do not seek to answer any questions but rather give a voice to their experiences.

The book starts with an in-bound booklet of eyewitness accounts of women's experiences of first arriving in Kaliningrad in 1945 from 'Big Russia' taken from the Oral History Archive of Kant University, Kaliningrad. We are then brought through contemporary images of the region and the women that now inhabit it with one of the personal handwritten accounts sliced into small parts and printed between the images. The book ends with a final in-bound booklet of the 'diary' entries of the modern women that are shown throughout the book.

<b>A photobook &amp; calendar celebrating 64 yrs of the iconic Volkswagen Type 2 </b>
<p>Depending on where you are in the world, the Volkswagen Type 2 is affectionately known by a number of
nicknames, but whatever it's called, it holds
a special space in our collective psyche! </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/117535/files/20131007013843-VW_Kombi_Festival_2013_040-3.jpg?1381135123"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>It has headlights that look like eyes, a badge for a nose, a bumper that
presents a wry smile and a tendency to break down at the worse possible time
and place (but is thankfully easily repairable).<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/117487/files/20131007010907-VW_Kombi_Festival_2013_314-1.jpg?1381133347"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It represents the dreams
and aspirations of an entire generation and embodies the idea of “freedom” in one big lovable bundle of tin, steel, vinyl and rubber. Just load up the van, grab
some friends and head down the coast to chase down some waves.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/117490/files/20131007011037-VW_Kombi_Festival_2013_141-1.jpg?1381133437"" src="""" style=""""/></p>In the US it's known as the ""<i>VW bus</i>"", or “<i>vee-dub</i>”, a ""<i>minibus</i>"", a ""<i>hippie van</i>"", a “<i>combie</i>” or just simply ""<i>The Bus</i>”. <br/><p>In the UK its the “<i>Camper</i>”. In Australia &amp; South America the “<i>Kombi</i>”. Affectionately called the ""<i>breadloaf</i>” in Portugal and the <i>""R</i><i>ugbrød - ie. rye bread "" </i>in Denmark and the “<i>Kleinbus</i>” in Chile and Finland.  It's the ""Volksie Bus"" in South Africa.</p>
<p>Apart from being the ultimate hippy mobile of the 60’s, it
was also embraced for more utilitarian purposes.</p>
<p>Some became hearses, refrigerated vans, taxi's, food trucks, ambulances,
postal vans, police vans, military vehicles 

 or specialty tradesman vans. Now many lay in a field somewhere, a rusty monument to another time, secretly hoping that some nostalgic soul will restore it to its former glory.</p>

<p>Sadly, after 64 years of faithful service, the Type 2 Volkswagen bus will cease
production this December in its last bastion - Brazil’s Sao Paulo. The German’s and Americans stopped production in 1979 because of tougher road safety regulations and now the
Brazilians are to do the same. <br/></p>
<p>VW produced over 10 million “bricks on wheels”
and it's a testament
 to the original design that so many are still going strong. All made possible by millions of backyard VW mechanics who trade and swap parts to the point of obsession.</p>

<p><b>Who are you?</b>  Hopefully you love the ""old bus"" as much as we do (or know someone who does) and are willing to support this last hurrah to the icon of 20 century alternative motoring.  It's also quite possible that if you are between the age of 30 and 50 years old you may have been conceived in the back of one. That may explain your peculiar attraction to corduroy, paisley prints and sandals...</p>

<h3> What You Get</h3>
<p>A beautifully produced 96 page journey into the heart and soul of this 20th century cultural icon. As many color photos as I could pack into the back of an old Kombi, together with some history, some weird and wonderful conversions and an ""up close and personal"" look at some owners . Even if you have never owned or driven one, you may have noticed that Kombi drivers give each other a secret wave as they pass on the highway. I attempt to delve into this secret society of VW aficionados and try to figure out what makes them tick.</p>
<p>You can support this project by selecting one of the cool perks. I've self published before, so I understand the challenges ahead and we are 100% committed to delivering all perks by the end of November if we reach the fixed funding target.</p>
<p><b>That's were you come in....</b></p>
<p>Choose an electronic version of the book for only $9 or if you would prefer the feel and smell of real paper (like I do), I'll send you the real thing from only $39 if you get in quick. (see the early bird perks to the right). </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/102647/files/20130929135634-popcover4.png?1380488194"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The book is to be printed in portrait format 8.25"" x 10.75""  by a leading worldwide printhouse, printed on super quality fine matte, acid free, fully recyclable stock with perfect binding (ie it has a proper spine). It will be printed on demand in one of 4 facilities across the US and Europe, depending on which is closest to you. This means there is no waste or unsold copies - with the bonus of fast door to door delivery with the smallest possible environmental footprint. That's why I've included shipping in the perk pricing and it's so low. A big sorry for those in Oz (like me), Asia, Africa or South America. Your shipping (also included) is a little more expensive since there is no similar print facilities in these regions.</p>
<p>The Fixed Funding goal of $US 2,500. <br/>So why have I chosen fixed rather than flexible funding? If you help me get to the target, that's when production volume discounts kick in and I've kept the perk prices low to reflect this volume.</p>
<p>If you don't fancy a book, and you have an empty space on the wall in your Man-Shed, score the massive 17 x 11"" 2014  Wall Calendar for only $25.

A photobook & calendar celebrating 64 yrs of the iconic Volkswagen Type 2 
Depending on where you are in the world, the Volkswagen Type 2 is affectionately known by a number of
nicknames, but whatever it's called, it holds
a special space in our collective psyche! 


It has headlights that look like eyes, a badge for a nose, a bumper that
presents a wry smile and a tendency to break down at the worse possible time
and place (but is thankfully easily repairable).
It represents the dreams
and aspirations of an entire generation and embodies the idea of “freedom” in one big lovable bundle of tin, steel, vinyl and rubber. Just load up the van, grab
some friends and head down the coast to chase down some waves.
In the US it's known as the ""VW bus"", or “vee-dub”, a ""minibus"", a ""hippie van"", a “combie” or just simply ""The Bus”. In the UK its the “Camper”. In Australia & South America the “Kombi”. Affectionately called the ""breadloaf” in Portugal and the ""Rugbrød - ie. rye bread "" in Denmark and the “Kleinbus” in Chile and Finland.  It's the ""Volksie Bus"" in South Africa.
Apart from being the ultimate hippy mobile of the 60’s, it
was also embraced for more utilitarian purposes.
Some became hearses, refrigerated vans, taxi's, food trucks, ambulances,
postal vans, police vans, military vehicles 

 or specialty tradesman vans. Now many lay in a field somewhere, a rusty monument to another time, secretly hoping that some nostalgic soul will restore it to its former glory.
The ""old bus"" graced covers of iconic Bob Dylan and Beach Boys
record albums and is forever linked to the Grateful Dead and their legion
of fans that chased the band across the US.Even Steve Jobs is said to have sold his VW van to buy circuit
boards to build one of the first Apple computers.


Sadly, after 64 years of faithful service, the Type 2 Volkswagen bus will cease
production this December in its last bastion - Brazil’s Sao Paulo. The German’s and Americans stopped production in 1979 because of tougher road safety regulations and now the
Brazilians are to do the same. 
VW produced over 10 million “bricks on wheels”
and it's a testament
 to the original design that so many are still going strong. All made possible by millions of backyard VW mechanics who trade and swap parts to the point of obsession.
Even though the famous type 2  has stopped rolling off the production line, ""the bus"" will forever live in our imagination and folklore.Who am I?   I'm a project manager by day and and a Kombi tragic the other 16 hours of the day. My wife is wonderful photographer, so with her help, we hope to inform, entertain and reminisce about everything Type 2 Vee Dub!
Who are you?  Hopefully you love the ""old bus"" as much as we do (or know someone who does) and are willing to support this last hurrah to the icon of 20 century alternative motoring.  It's also quite possible that if you are between the age of 30 and 50 years old you may have been conceived in the back of one. That may explain your peculiar attraction to corduroy, paisley prints and sandals...

 What You Get
A beautifully produced 96 page journey into the heart and soul of this 20th century cultural icon. As many color photos as I could pack into the back of an old Kombi, together with some history, some weird and wonderful conversions and an ""up close and personal"" look at some owners . Even if you have never owned or driven one, you may have noticed that Kombi drivers give each other a secret wave as they pass on the highway. I attempt to delve into this secret society of VW aficionados and try to figure out what makes them tick.
You can support this project by selecting one of the cool perks. I've self published before, so I understand the challenges ahead and we are 100% committed to delivering all perks by the end of November if we reach the fixed funding target.
That's were you come in....
Choose an electronic version of the book for only $9 or if you would prefer the feel and smell of real paper (like I do), I'll send you the real thing from only $39 if you get in quick. (see the early bird perks to the right). 

The book is to be printed in portrait format 8.25"" x 10.75""  by a leading worldwide printhouse, printed on super quality fine matte, acid free, fully recyclable stock with perfect binding (ie it has a proper spine). It will be printed on demand in one of 4 facilities across the US and Europe, depending on which is closest to you. This means there is no waste or unsold copies - with the bonus of fast door to door delivery with the smallest possible environmental footprint. That's why I've included shipping in the perk pricing and it's so low. A big sorry for those in Oz (like me), Asia, Africa or South America. Your shipping (also included) is a little more expensive since there is no similar print facilities in these regions.
The Fixed Funding goal of $US 2,500. So why have I chosen fixed rather than flexible funding? If you help me get to the target, that's when production volume discounts kick in and I've kept the perk prices low to reflect this volume.
If you don't fancy a book, and you have an empty space on the wall in your Man-Shed, score the massive 17 x 11"" 2014  Wall Calendar for only $25. Replace that tired old girly skin calendar with something that has a real body designed get you through all next year!

Are you a Kombi freak and want to contribute to the book?
I'm not just crowd funding this project but  also seeking submissions for the book!
If you have a unique VW bus or know somebody that does - show it off in the book! Please contact me via email poprascal@gmail.com. Photo's before and after would be great and I'll send you some questions about your VW bus project. Who knows you may be the star of the book!

<p><u>Where Flowers Grow</u> began three years ago when we adopted
our son and daughter from Ethiopia.  From that moment on, Ethiopia
became a part of our heritage as well.  A year and a half ago, I knew that
it was time to return and do something more for Ethiopian orphans<i>.

<p>Photography is one of
my loves, so I decided to leverage it in Ethiopia.  After researching
numerous organizations and talking with people in country, I was referred to
Ebenezer Grace Children's Home, a growing orphanage in Hawassa, Ethiopia serving 36 orphans.
 Knowing the needs of their growing organization, I decided to create a
coffee table book to generate awareness and funding for what they do.  </p>
<p>So in May 2014, I
traveled to Ethiopia and spent 11 days with these amazing children.  Their stories were inspiring, their lives were simply beautiful.  It was effortless--I took over 2,000 digital images, 700 Polaroids, and 600
Instax prints.  Many of these I gave to the children and workers at the
orphanage.  The rest I reserved for the coffee table book.  I chose to
use vintage Polaroid cameras for many of the shots, because I believe it best represents who they are: one-of-a-kind, precious, and worthy.  It imparts an organic, timeless aspect to the images as well. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F9SkU5k7Mges%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9SkU5k7Mges&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F9SkU5k7Mges%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div> <p></p>
<p>I created a prototype

be 68 pages with large 5 inch images and text that honors the lives and relationships of the people I met there.  The photos include both vintage Polaroid images and digital
images.  Your support of this project will allow for an initial press run
of 400 copies, most of which will be sold to benefit Ebenezer Grace Children's

<p>To meet this goal, I need to raise $5,500.  The funds will help me design, set the

<p><strong>For years, we have been working on presentations of objects with focus on tourism</strong>, we make websites, interior photos, panoramas for Google Maps (Google Street View Trusted Photographers), and for some time we have been fascinated by drones and presentation possibilities of facilities and places they allow. We know that peoplo love to see more than from the ground and <strong>aerial 360 panoramas are perfect for sightseeing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>We started to make aerial panoramas and combine them into virtual tours from the air </strong>and it is drawing more and more attention and interest. That's why we started to combine aerial panos into one common <strong>platform with virtual tours</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The basis for this platform are panoramic photos</strong> from the air so we set the first target to create virtual tours around <strong>15 places on the East Baltic Coast in Poland</strong>. We want the whole tour to be based on <strong>150 panoramas</strong>. We currently have 40, we need resources to add another 110.</p>
<p>We have calculated the amount we need on average for one panorama - 130 $. We are able to do 30% alone, so <strong>we need about 90 $ on average for one panorama</strong>. The goal is 110 panoramas, that is 9900 $, but regardless of whether we can achieve the goal every 90 $ support will add another panorama in the tour. And if we get more, we will be able to make more panoramas in other regions of Poland.</p>

<p><strong>When you are going to any place to spend your free time</strong>, you usually want to know where you are going. You browse photos on booking.com, look for information on tripadvisor.com, check the website of the objects you are going to visit.<br/>Usually on these pages you can see photos that show how the object looks like inside and outside. Most often photos are taken from the ground, although more often you can view the pictures from the air. However, mostly these are pictures showing only the object and the places selected inside.</p>
<p><strong>360 photos became a great innovation</strong>, which can be seen more often in Google Maps as part of Street View, showing a view around - in each direction. The next step  is the so-called Business View, i.e. pictures of interiors and objects that can also be placed in Google Maps. Thanks to them, you can see the object in detail, everything inside is there is nothing to hide. Then you know where you are going and what you pay for.<br/>Ok, but you are not sitting inside all the time, so <strong>what about the neighborhood?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here Google Maps with satellite photos are very helpful</strong>, allow you to see the area from the air, get an idea of ​​the location of the object and the surrounding attractions. Unfortunately, they are often of poor quality, not always made with favorable weather conditions and often outdated.</p>
<p>Surely, photos from the drone showing the surroundings and objects are more interesting, but they have a limited perspective to the selected frame, they do not show the whole area.</p>
<p><strong>But ... from the air you can also take panoramic 360 photos that allow you to look around!</strong> Thanks to that, we can also look around the area from a bird's eye view!</p>
<p><strong>What if these photos are as well combined with each other in a virtual tour like this?</strong></p>

<h3>About project</h3>
<p><strong>For years, we have been dealing with the presentation of objects</strong>, we make websites, interior photos, panoramas are Google Maps (Google Street View Trusted Photographers), and for some time we have been fascinated with drones and presentation possibilities of facilities and places they allow.</p>
<p><strong>Pictures from the drone allow you to look at objects and surroundings</strong> from a perspective that we do not watch on a daily basis, which is why they are so attractive. They also show larger areas. For over a year, we have started to take 360 ​​panoramic photos from the air, which give even more presentation possibilities! We take such photos for clients and combine them with virtual tours from the ground, it lets you see practically everything!<br/>However, these are single pictures. In the next steps we came up with the idea to connect more with each other and create an aerial virtual tour - for example around the city. Due to our location, we began to create a virtual tour around Sopot - a beautiful tourist city in northern Poland on the Baltic Sea. But there are so many beautiful tourist areas around, that we went a step further and started planning a bigger tour ... and a very large project was created!<br/>And because it requires resources that currently exceed our capabilities, we decided to look for support and that's why we are on indiegogo.com and we count on your help!</p>
<h3><strong>Idea</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Our dream is to create a virtual tour from the air in attractive tourist areas all over Poland</strong> to allow them to be seen from the air and to facilitate the selection of places to visit live and this way promote Poland and encourage tourists to visit this beautiful country.</p>
<p>To make your dream come true you have to start working on it and take the next steps, <strong>so we started with a tour on the Polish Baltic Coast</strong>, the most popular tourist area, especially in the summer. We've developed a plan, we've chosen places and we've started working. The result of this work is a demo tour consisting of 40 panoramas around the Tri-City - an agglomeration of cities of Gdańsk, Gdynia and Sopot. We can continue the project ourselves, but we know that it can take a lot of time - a few months. For pictures to look good they should be done in good weather, on a sunny day, and the number of such days is limited. Well ... winter is comming! ;)</p>
<p>Therefore, if we wanted to continue, we would not end it this year, we could return to the pictures in May, when it will turn green again.</p>
<p><strong>But ... we can make it this year - if we collect funds for development.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Process</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How the process of creating the tour looks like:</strong><br/>1. We take pictures - approximately 25 photos per one panorama<br/>2. Each of the photos needs to be prepared - colors, light, contrasts, etc.<br/>3. The single photos are later stitched into a 360 panoramic photo<br/>4. Panoramas combines into a virtual tour with the help of software that allows you to view them and move between panoramas<br/>5. In a virtual tour we place markers for points - tourist facilities, hotels, restaurants, etc. Ultimately, we want to expand them with descriptions of selected places, photos and links, this will be the most time-consuming part of the project, which we can also complement and expand later.<br/>We are able to do each of the stages of work independently, but this work is very much and it would take us a few months. But we can speed it up by commissioning selected stages outside.<br/>It is particularly critical to take pictures as soon as possible, so that we can make it this season, while the leaves have not fallen from the trees :)</p>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>Because we have already done a lot of work, we are able to estimate the time and costs of the entire project.</p>
<p><strong>The cost of one panorama</strong> including the shooting / purchase of photos, processing, stitching and programming the tour <strong>is about 130 $</strong> at market rates. In order to make a trip this season, we have to outsource about <strong>70%</strong> of the work outside, especially fast shooting on sunny days, because it has to be done in the same time. This means that <strong>we need about 90 $ for each panorama</strong>, which will be in a tour. We will do the rest of the work ourselves!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Target: Stage 1 - Virtual Tour of Baltic East Coast in Poland</h3>
<p>As we started thinking about the project, we comprehensively prepared a virtual tour plan all over Poland. Such a project will take a lot of time. But to check if it meets interest at all, we want to first perform Stage 1 - a tour along the coast.<br/>We've chosen <strong>15 tourist destinations</strong> of great popularity for this tour, in total the tour will be based on <strong>150 panoramas</strong> from the air. Below is a list of selected places:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537612388/u5asbzq5rpqqlcdpmp4h.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As part of the demo version that we have prepared, we have today 40 panoramas of 3 major cities - Gdańsk, Gdynia, Sopot.</p>
<p>You can see it here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gdańsk (14 panoramas): <a href=""http://visitpoland.online/gdansk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://visitpoland.online/gdansk/</a>
</li>
<li>Sopot (14 panoramas): <a href=""http://visitpoland.online/sopot/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://visitpoland.online/sopot/</a>
</li>
<li>Gdynia (12 panoramas): <a href=""http://visitpoland.online/gdynia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://visitpoland.online/gdynia/</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All the panos we are publishing on our new facebook profile as well: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/VisitPolandOnline"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/VisitPolandOnline</a></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The entire tour is to consist of <strong>150 panoramas</strong> in the final version, which means that <strong>we still need 110 panoramas</strong>, that is a total of <strong>9900 $ support for this stage</strong> to be successful!</p>
<p>What if we do not collect this amount? <strong>Each 90 $ is another panorama,</strong> so we'll make as many panoramas as we have enough resources. So the tour will grow anyway!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>You will be able to see results on our Facebook profile, where we will publish all the panoramas from our virtual tour: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/VisitPolandOnline"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/VisitPolandOnline</a></strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>What if we gather more? Then, without waiting, we will move with the next panoramas so that the dream of a virtual tour around Poland will come true :)<br/>Our big idea is to take a tour over the majority of tourist areas in Poland, after finishing one stage, we will go to the next one.</p>
<h3>Next stages:</h3>
<p><strong>Stage 2 - Warsaw and Cracow - most popular tourist cities in Poland (D1, D2)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stage 3 - Zakopane and Polish Mountines (C1)</strong></p>
<p>Our big idea is to take a tour over the majority of tourist areas in Poland, after finishing one stage, we will go to the next one.<br/>Below we show the map that we have prepared. There are 5 main zones on it:<br/>A. Baltic Coast<br/>B. Masurian Lakes - the land of lakes<br/>C. Polish Mountains<br/>D. Larger tourist cities in central Poland and their surroundings<br/>E. Other smaller interesting places in Poland</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537614342/av748rs1bos7ou7rsdka.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So - if we succeed in completing the first stage, we will go straight to the next one. And if our work will meet interest and we will be able to obtain the appropriate funds, we are able to complete the entire project by the end of next year, so let's get started :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's next? Not only Poland.</h3>
<p>And what next? If we are able to implement such a project in Poland in cooperation with local drone operators and photographers, then we can also continue it in other countries .. and we are already thinking about it, but first let's do our first stage!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Main risk is the weather. ""Winter is coming"" so we do not have much time to shoot photos, so the sooner we start the bigger the chance that we will be able to finish the project this year. So the faster we manage to collect funds the more panoramas we can include in our project.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
For years, we have been working on presentations of objects with focus on tourism, we make websites, interior photos, panoramas for Google Maps (Google Street View Trusted Photographers), and for some time we have been fascinated by drones and presentation possibilities of facilities and places they allow. We know that peoplo love to see more than from the ground and aerial 360 panoramas are perfect for sightseeing.
We started to make aerial panoramas and combine them into virtual tours from the air and it is drawing more and more attention and interest. That's why we started to combine aerial panos into one common platform with virtual tours.
The basis for this platform are panoramic photos from the air so we set the first target to create virtual tours around 15 places on the East Baltic Coast in Poland. We want the whole tour to be based on 150 panoramas. We currently have 40, we need resources to add another 110.
We have calculated the amount we need on average for one panorama - 130 $. We are able to do 30% alone, so we need about 90 $ on average for one panorama. The goal is 110 panoramas, that is 9900 $, but regardless of whether we can achieve the goal every 90 $ support will add another panorama in the tour. And if we get more, we will be able to make more panoramas in other regions of Poland.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have always wanted to travel the length of the coast of Ireland to find the hidden coves and overlooked inlets.  To me the <strong>Wild Atlantic Way</strong> became my siren call and again I found myself as a tourist in my adopted home. </p>
<p>The <strong>Wild Atlantic Way </strong>was developed to promote tourism along the series of linked roadways that make it up.  I want to be a part of that endeavour by creating a catalogue of time lapse photo clips of sites along the entire route. </p>
<p>There are so many benefits of this project:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An organized catalogue of clips and still images assembled by location, duration and special attributes. </p></li>
<li><p>Clips will include both common and more obscure way points and surrounding locations.</p></li>
<li><p>These clips will be made available to communities, businesses, and civic and tourism agencies to advertise the route.  Each clip will be available with generous licensing rights for extended use.</p></li>
<li><p>A unified view of what the <strong>Wild Atlantic Way </strong>was like in 2017.  Provide a set of baseline images for the period from 2017-2018 that can be used in the future to measure use and activity.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for assistance to raise €16,500. </p>
<p>The project will take almost a year to complete.  Most of the field work will be done during the summer, autumn, and winter of 2017-2018.  The clips will be assembled, catalogued and uploaded as we progress and after the field work is completed. </p>
<p>We will be providing camera equipment, tripods, cases, Adobe software, web structure and expertise.  But that will not be enough to complete this project.</p>
<p>We will need additional financial assistance for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>€7,000 for direct production expenses including insurance, travel, food and lodging.</p></li>
<li><p>€9,500 for additional equipment including an additional camera, sliders, laptop, software and website upgrade. You can find a list of the necessary equipment in our blog article:  <a href=""http://waw-project.sleepinggiantstudio.ie/wordpress/additional-camera-equipment-necessary/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">What additional equipment is necessary</a><a href=""http://waw-project.sleepinggiantstudio.ie/wordpress/additional-camera-equipment-necessary/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">?</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The name of everyone who donates to the project will be named and thanked on our Donor’s Page.  In addition, we will provide a few other perks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Smaller donations will receive prints.</p></li>
<li><p>Medium level donations will receive prints and discounted clips for promotional use. </p></li>
<li><p>Large donations will receive free clips for promotional use. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We have never done a project like this.  No one has, that is why we are doing it.  Large sweeping project have inherent risks and challenges.  Though risk can never fully be avoided, the effect can be somewhat mitigated through careful planning and an adherence to the general project principals. </p>
<ul><li><p>Equipment theft, damage or failure can be somewhat mitigated with appropriate insurance coverage.  This cost of this coverage is included in the direct production expenses and will be extended over the term of the project.</p></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Illness, injury or death of the project principals.  Both principals will be covered by health and life insurance over the course of the project.  If one or both principals become temporarily unable to work on the project the term of the project will be extended.  If one of the principals is unable to continue then that person will be replaced.  If both are unable to continue the project will be cancelled, and no refund will be issued. </p></li>
<li><p>Weather delays.  Most of this project will be shot outside and subject to prevailing weather conditions.  Part of our considerations for each region includes existing meteorological data.  Weather delays may occur and the result will be an extension of the project term. </p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Other ways you can help.</h3>
<p>We understand that money is tight and that there are many worthy projects that beg for assistance.  There are other things that can be done to help:</p>

Smaller donations will receive prints.
Medium level donations will receive prints and discounted clips for promotional use. 
Large donations will receive free clips for promotional use. 

Risks and challenges
We have never done a project like this.  No one has, that is why we are doing it.  Large sweeping project have inherent risks and challenges.  Though risk can never fully be avoided, the effect can be somewhat mitigated through careful planning and an adherence to the general project principals. 
Equipment theft, damage or failure can be somewhat mitigated with appropriate insurance coverage.  This cost of this coverage is included in the direct production expenses and will be extended over the term of the project.

Illness, injury or death of the project principals.  Both principals will be covered by health and life insurance over the course of the project.  If one or both principals become temporarily unable to work on the project the term of the project will be extended.  If one of the principals is unable to continue then that person will be replaced.  If both are unable to continue the project will be cancelled, and no refund will be issued. 
Weather delays.  Most of this project will be shot outside and subject to prevailing weather conditions.  Part of our considerations for each region includes existing meteorological data.  Weather delays may occur and the result will be an extension of the project term. 

Other ways you can help.
We understand that money is tight and that there are many worthy projects that beg for assistance.  There are other things that can be done to help:

<h3>Open Mag Vol I </h3> <p>Hi, my name is Alex, I'm a mexican photographer who believes in diversity of beauty. In the world we live we are constantly in front of parametters of how human beauty should be. I truly believe that beauty is much more than a list of stereotypes.</p>
<p>Everybody can enjoy their own beauty and sexuallity, and we all have the right to feel confortable in our own bodies.</p>
<p>DeProfundis MX exists to remind us that we all are equal and nobody is more important just for fitting in media beauty standars. It also teach us that aesthetic values can help people to experience situations and sensations through media such as photography, showing that anyone can their own body.</p>
<p>Erotism and self love is one of the most important parts of personal development and happiness.</p>

<p>Soy un fotógrafo mexicano que cree en la diversidad de la belleza, en un mundo en donde estamos constantemente bombardeados de parámetros del ""deber ser"" de la belleza humana. Creo que la belleza es mucho más que una lista de estereotipos.</p>
<p>Todos podemos disfrutar nuestra belleza y sexualidad, y todos tenemos el derecho de sentirnos bien con nuestros propios cuerpos. </p>
<p>DeProfundis MX existe para recordarnos que todos somos iguales y nadie es más importante por encajar en los estándares de belleza difundidos a través de los medios. Los valores estéticos pueden ayudar a la gente a experimentar situaciones y sensaciones a través de medios como la fotografía, enseñándonos que cualquiera puede disfrutar de su propio cuerpo.</p>
<p>El erotismo y el auto-cuidado de nuestras emociones respecto a lo que somos es una de las partes más importantes del desarrollo personal y nuestra propia felicidad.</p> </div><div>
<h3>What we offer / Qué ofrecemos</h3> <p>We are a team working with homoerotic beauty diversity represented through photo and video. DeProfundis wants to make an art mag  with 100 homoerotic photos. </p>
<p>We need 5000 USD for the photography work, models, editorial design and impresion of 500 copies.</p>

</div></div>","Open Mag Vol I  Hi, my name is Alex, I'm a mexican photographer who believes in diversity of beauty. In the world we live we are constantly in front of parametters of how human beauty should be. I truly believe that beauty is much more than a list of stereotypes.
Everybody can enjoy their own beauty and sexuallity, and we all have the right to feel confortable in our own bodies.
DeProfundis MX exists to remind us that we all are equal and nobody is more important just for fitting in media beauty standars. It also teach us that aesthetic values can help people to experience situations and sensations through media such as photography, showing that anyone can their own body.
Erotism and self love is one of the most important parts of personal development and happiness.

Soy un fotógrafo mexicano que cree en la diversidad de la belleza, en un mundo en donde estamos constantemente bombardeados de parámetros del ""deber ser"" de la belleza humana. Creo que la belleza es mucho más que una lista de estereotipos.
Todos podemos disfrutar nuestra belleza y sexualidad, y todos tenemos el derecho de sentirnos bien con nuestros propios cuerpos. 
DeProfundis MX existe para recordarnos que todos somos iguales y nadie es más importante por encajar en los estándares de belleza difundidos a través de los medios. Los valores estéticos pueden ayudar a la gente a experimentar situaciones y sensaciones a través de medios como la fotografía, enseñándonos que cualquiera puede disfrutar de su propio cuerpo.
El erotismo y el auto-cuidado de nuestras emociones respecto a lo que somos es una de las partes más importantes del desarrollo personal y nuestra propia felicidad. 
What we offer / Qué ofrecemos We are a team working with homoerotic beauty diversity represented through photo and video. DeProfundis wants to make an art mag  with 100 homoerotic photos. 
We need 5000 USD for the photography work, models, editorial design and impresion of 500 copies.

<h3>Origins of the Sweet Dreams Photo-Book Project</h3>
<p>Hello to everyone.</p>
<p>My name is Zaida and I am starting my career as a model. As you may already know, all the beginnings are hard and complicated.</p>
<p>I have already done a few photographic sessions and performances, now I want to create a Photo-Book and spread it all over the world and let people know about me.</p>
<p>Of course, that would cost a lot of money which I currently don't have, so a friend recommended me to start a Indiegogo campaing to try to get the funds for the project.</p>
<p>We discussed a lot about the thematic of the Photo-Book, size and characteristics, and that’s how the title and the contents came to us.</p>
<p>As this job is like a dream becoming reality, we found that ""Sweet Dreams"" will be an appropriate name.</p>
<p>So that, once we had the name, thinking the thematic was easier than we thought at first.</p>
<p>That’s how we decided that it will be a lingerie and bed thematic. We think that we will get great results with that thematic and people will enjoy it.</p>
<p>The images that you see here, even they are mine, are not the ones that will be in the Photo-Book. A new photographic sesion will be made from which all the photographs will be taken.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/p206x206/74294_10200173484644703_1442825913_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Photo-Book</h3>
<p>Sweet Dreams will be a 25x25cm 58 pages full color Photo-Book when it’s completed, <strong>but this will only happen with your support!</strong></p>
<p>The book will be a Limited Edition of 1.000 units and each copy will be dated, numbered and personally signed by me.</p>
<p>Given the large dimensions, volume and print quality requirements, this type of a photo book is fairly expensive to print.</p>
<p>The Indiegogo goal will only cover the first 200 units, including the photographic session, printing and taxes. If this Indiegogo campaign raises funds beyond that, the amount of copies will be increased accordingly, until the Limited Edition run of 1.000 copies is reached, which will cost around 35.000 €</p>

Then I went on to check all the photos I had taken over the last three years with my dslr camera which i had bought almost at the same time with that phone. What I saw was all my street photography photos taken in these three years from two different perspectives and how that affected the overall appearance of the two group's photos.<br/>Photos, which until then I just saw individually, took a whole new meaning and the David and Goliath photobook idea was born.<br/>I'm not a pro, I do what I do just because I love it and this is my first attempt to go public after 9 years of photography. I gathered what I considered the best photos of both David and Goliath which led me to 52 photos from both groups (26 from each), I planed the photobook and worked with friends to prepare it. The photos cover a wide range from buildings, to public transportation and people, all street photography aspects I like to shoot, and where taken while commuting, during long walks or just site seeing. All photographs are in black and white and with minimum editing, mainly cropping and exposure adjusting and Davids photos were exclusively edited on the cell phone it self, so you see there is no cheating for the little guy.<br/><br/></p>
