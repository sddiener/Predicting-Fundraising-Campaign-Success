At least equally important is the geometry change that can occur when climbing. The Missing Link is able to fully extend the rear shock during steep climbs, while still maintaining full bump absorbing capabilities. This extension, coupled with more fork compression due to the forward rider position, can effectively be up to 3-4 degrees steeper in the head tube and seat tube, than another bike of similar travel, with similar static geometry. </p><p>Simply put, this puts the rider in a much better position on the bike, more over the pedals and handlebar, enabling more of the rider’s energy to go directly into pedaling. It’s so much easier to climb, because you are focused on pedaling and the terrain, not trying to maintain a good position on the bike while feeling as if you’re falling off the back. </p><p>On a long travel trail or enduro bike, this translates into easier climbs , with more energy at the top for the fun stuff to come. For a short travel cross country bike, this translates into time. It is said that cross country races are won on the climbs. The Missing Link offers a quantifiable time advantage on a climb.</p><p>At the same time, the ability for the Missing Link to engage the suspension at speed allows the geometry and head tube angle to relax, further increasing the advantage of the ""adaptive"" geometry over conventional designs.</p><p>The intuitively variable suspension performance, combined with the adaptive geometry combines for a ride like no other.</p><p>Listen to what demo riders and actual paying customers have to say:</p><p><i><strong>""climbing this shallow rock covered grade. The Outburst was - I'll just say what I said to Brian after riding through there - it was like cheating.

I'm going to trust that the competency and poise I felt on the short downhill bursts will translate onto bigger terrain.

<h3>
<u>Missing Link Attributes</u>  </h3>
</div>
<p>This unique, patent pending, suspension takes all of the force inputs available, from the rider, the terrain, the laws of physics, and provides the best suspension action and frame geometry for those conditions.  </p>
</div><p>It does this by using a novel (MISSING) link,, which, by reacting to the fore/aft horizontal forces on it, will control the amount and quality of the suspension travel to provide only what is needed for the given conditions. Additionally, it will also provide the optimum geometry available for the conditions.  </p><p>It can provide a much steeper climbing geometry than you could normally use on an all around bike. Eventually what goes up must come down, so in turn it allows much slacker geometry when the Missing Link allows the suspension to fall into its travel at speed or pointing downhill. </p><p>The Missing Link does allow the suspension travel to vary from essential zero, under maximum power, to whatever the maximum limit of the bike is, and provide unprecedented ability to absorb bumps for that amount of travel due to the manipulation of the spring force as needed, as well as the initial rearward wheel trajectory.</p><p><i><strong>The graph below shows how the Missing Link can modify spring force at the wheel, in either a positive or negative direction, depending on forward acceleration or bump and braking forces.</strong></i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483550533/tt4pkgsnwbwexungvufa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483560216/bgvrkv71nmtzdyupzgph.jpg"" src=""""/></p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pjlyimeL7yM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3> <u><strong>Missing Link Peformance Features</strong></u>   </h3><p> Virtual hardtail on steep, smooth terrain  </p><p> Very steep climbing geometry (ST and HT)</p><p> Higher BB when climbing  </p><p> Instant reaction to bumps, even while climbing  </p><p> Stiff, short travel suspension with moderate geometry while sprinting on level ground  </p><p> Instant reaction to bumps, even while sprinting  </p><p> Slacker geometry at higher speed and/or downhill</p><p> Very plush suspension reaction to bumps as spring rate falls during initial bump travel  </p><p> Suspension does not wallow in travel due to ML  </p><p> Bottomless feel due to rising rate in last part of travel  </p><p> Initial rearward axle path to further aid square edge bump absorption</p><p> Immediately slacker geometry upon application of rear brake  </p><p> Slower “topout” reaction of suspension when encountering a jump lip or other bump that would have a tendency to kick the back up. This is due to the increase in rebound force from sag to full extension, a result of the rapidly changing motion ration in this range of travel.

Offering advantages to each category that until now have been unattainable.  </p><p> This design utilizes very short, stiff and light links. The ST, BB and main pivot are tied in with the shock mount resulting in high chassis stiffness.

After very careful consideration, we settled on four build levels.</p><p>At the lowest priced level, we wanted to offer the best possible value at the lowest price. The caveat was that all of the components had to perform at a base level. That means every component must be cable of serious mountain bike terrain, including extremely technical. They also must be able to survive such use. This is what we came up with. The <strong>LowDough</strong>. Yes, at this base price, you have to lower your saddle manually (all other builds come with a dropper), but this is a value priced bike you can ride any terrain. These builds are around 30 pounds complete, no pedals  </p><p>The next level up, the <strong>WorkingMan</strong>, is indeed, for every discriminating woman or man. This build has important upgrades at almost every component from suspension to brakes to shifters and wheels. A dropper post is also included. The upgrades save weight and improve performance and reliability for the more serious and avid rider, that might more regularly ride tougher terrain. The build is intended to use the ""sweet spot"" of component technology. That is to say, use components that are close enough to the best in order to utilize most of the technology, while avoiding the price. These builds are around 29 pounds with no pedals.  </p><p>The <strong>RACE</strong> build is just that. It is intended for the rider that wants to race enduro, or even downhill on their Tantrum. It includes a longer travel, higher performance fork, slacker head tube angle, upgraded rear shock, lighter but stronger wheels and more powerful brakes. A lighter crank and saddle help keep the weight under 29 pounds, no pedals.</p><p>Now...........enter the <strong>DDS</strong>. Let's face it, if you can afford it, a top end build kit is SWEET!!!

Things that he is passionate about and enjoys daily. For whatever reasons, for Brian Berthold, those things always seem to involve speed. Even as a kid, bikes were being modified. Wheels, tires, gears, frames; it was mix and match with whatever worked. There were even a few ill-fated attempts at adding suspension (to a StingRay) where there was none.</p><p>Bikes and wooden crate downhill carts were soon augmented with motorcycles and real karts. Where to channel this passion was an issue at first. With no chance of college and the impending Vietnam era draft looming, Berthold chose to enlist in the Air Force, serving a 3 year stint in the test ranges of Nevada. The desert was good for racing motorcycles, which Brian was already involved in and would continue to do long after. By the time his enlistment ended, Berthold realized that the GI Bill would let him get a Mechanical Engineering degree  and let him make a good living at his passion, making things go fast.</p><p>Brian spent the next 15 years as a professional race engineer, chassis designer, aerodynamicist and shock absorber design specialist. His work has won many races and championships at the highest levels of motorsport, from Formula 1, to Indy Cars to Paris/Peking Rallye cars to LeMans prototype sports cars. He had worked for such factory teams as Jaguar, Audi, Nissan, Toyota as well as motor racing luminaries such as Jackie Stewart, Hans Stuck, Walter Rohrl, Arie Lyundyk, Chip Ganassi, Robby Gordon and many more.</p><p>Throughout his high speed motorsports career, bikes were never far from Berthold’s focus. He was known in the pits for bringing whatever his latest creation was and riding it through the paddock, eschewing the common scooters and golf carts. Riding a bike around a race track provided subtle insights that helped Brian engineer the car. Things such as a slight, previously unnoticed elevation change or a bump, entering or exiting a corner.</p><p>When the mountain bike world started getting serious about suspension in the 90’s, Berthold knew he had something to offer. While still employed full time in auto racing, Brian started racing XC and downhill and developed OE prototype shocks for Cannondale and Proflex. To address a growing demand for downhill specific products, he designed a highly regarded 7 inch travel upside down fork. Brian sponsored a male and female pro DH racer, as well as traveling the NORBA National DH circuit himself, racing as an amateur while servicing customers and athletes.</p><p>Later on, first with his Brake Therapy disc brake conversion for the rear in high demand since no bikes had mounts on the frame, then with the Brake Therapy floating brakes, Brian had customers ranging from John Tomac’s factory team, to the Giant, Jamis and Trek factory DH teams as well as supplying floating brakes to Trek on an OE basis. He then starting working with and sponsoring Fabian Barel on the Kona factory DH team. This led to Brake Therapy having full factory sponsorship for the entire team, resulting in multiple World DH championships for Fabian and Tracey Mosely.</p><p>As he was already designing and licensing floating brakes to Kona, Berthold approached them with his concept for a Magic Link bike. Just a plastic model at the time, but Kona gave Brian a Dawg to hack up and make a rideable prototype, which Brian promptly dubbed the “Frankendawg”. Less than a year later, the first production Magic Link Coilairs were in the hands of customers. Rushed to market, the first bikes suffered from early QC issues and were a bit ungainly to look at. Berthold remembers “my mandate was to adapt the invention into an existing Kona frame, changing as little as possible. The result was akin to stuffing a V8 into a Chevy Vega (ok a Prius).  </p><p>But the bikes garnered worldwide critical success and were among the earliest models to sell out. The line spread to 3 models with the G2 version, which was cleaner in every detail, with the shorter travel Abra Cadabra and 2+2 complimenting the big mountain Coilair. Said Berthold “the G2 bikes were a clean sheet of paper, which I really enjoyed designing and working with the factory to innovate new production methods to optimize the design for the Magic Link”  </p><p>The Magic Link bikes sold well over a 5 year period, garnering over US$40 million in sales and numerous glowing magazine reviews for its suspension performance. </p><p>Brian knew he could design an even better system. A system with the Magic Link’s advantages of variable geometry and spring rate according to the demands of rider and terrain, but in a more simple layout, lighter, stiffer, easier and cheaper to make, easier to understand and setup and less visually intimidating due to the elimination of the secondary auxiliary shock.  </p><p>The Missing Link was born, with the added advantages of even more geometry change and the ability to go to infinite stiffness in the rear spring rate, if climbing dictated and smooth surface allowed.  </p><p>Brian decided to take a different route licensing this design. The exclusive arrangement was just that. It excluded too many brands and people that wanted to enjoy the design. Berthold decided the best way to make it available was to start his own brand. Using a wealth of connections and knowledge accumulated from the bike industry, he formed Tantrum Cycles not only to make the design available to customers, but to promote and license the design to other brands. This would increase the scope of availability. And no matter what the licensees might do, Brian knew that with Tantrum, he was free to offer the bike in whatever configuration he might choose.</p><p>For a detailed pictorial account of Brian's career, please go to <a href=""http://www.brianberthold.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.brianberthold.com</a></p><h3> <strong><u>Tantrum Timeline</u></strong>

These funds will provide very useful cash flow for all phases of this startup.</p><p> </p></div>","Why start Tantrum Cycles? The short answer? To get it out there. Since the advent of suspension for mountain bikes, the traditional goals of plush suspension action for comfort, traction and control has been at odds with the desire to minimize rider induced suspension action due to pedaling and weight transfer due to climbing.Until now, it has never been accomplished.The top reviewers and press in the mountain bike world have ridden and confirmed the Missing Link's unique capabilitiesHere's what Pinkbike's Richard Cunningham had to say:The Missing Link “does the impossible; pedals like a hardtail and delivers a plush ride over bumps-without levers or electronics”  ”The Missing Link delivers the goods. Compared to the current crop of carbon superbikes, the Tantrum Meltdown performs well on the downs - essential for any 160-millimeter trail bike-and its pedaling action is better than all of them”.   http://www.pinkbike.com/news/first-ride-tantrum...  Zach Overholt at Bike Rumor has this to say: “I’d go so far as saying the Meltdown may be one of the best climbing 160mm travel enduro bikes I’ve ridden.- “the suspension remains surprisingly supple while climbing, yet offers a supremely efficient climb.-excellent small bump absorption, yet climbs and pedals way better than the travel should allow.”  Zach concludes: “It’s – mindboggling because the design carries with it all the suspension clichés that have become so commonly thrown around, only this actually works.”http://www.bikerumor.com/2016/11/03/tantrum-cyc...Even in tech-savvy Germany, the bike's design is turning heads:Eurobike'16-Tantrum Cycles Missing Link, the new Superbike?http://twentynineinches-de.com/2016/09/13/eurob... The above statements are important, but in reality, only half the story. At least equally important is the geometry change that can occur when climbing. The Missing Link is able to fully extend the rear shock during steep climbs, while still maintaining full bump absorbing capabilities. This extension, coupled with more fork compression due to the forward rider position, can effectively be up to 3-4 degrees steeper in the head tube and seat tube, than another bike of similar travel, with similar static geometry. Simply put, this puts the rider in a much better position on the bike, more over the pedals and handlebar, enabling more of the rider’s energy to go directly into pedaling. It’s so much easier to climb, because you are focused on pedaling and the terrain, not trying to maintain a good position on the bike while feeling as if you’re falling off the back. On a long travel trail or enduro bike, this translates into easier climbs , with more energy at the top for the fun stuff to come. For a short travel cross country bike, this translates into time. It is said that cross country races are won on the climbs. The Missing Link offers a quantifiable time advantage on a climb.At the same time, the ability for the Missing Link to engage the suspension at speed allows the geometry and head tube angle to relax, further increasing the advantage of the ""adaptive"" geometry over conventional designs.The intuitively variable suspension performance, combined with the adaptive geometry combines for a ride like no other.Listen to what demo riders and actual paying customers have to say:""climbing this shallow rock covered grade. The Outburst was - I'll just say what I said to Brian after riding through there - it was like cheating. I had all the traction from riding my FS bike through there, and none of the fighting the suspension. Standing up and shifting the bike around, the bike pedaled like my hardtail, but I had traction for days.""""did not bottom out the bike at all, nor did I ever get the sense that it wasn't THE most plush bike I've ever ridden. Yet, it still pedaled as well - better? - than the best bikes I've ridden."" co""it rails corners with confidence""""it wouldn’t get out of shape when hitting roots in corners at speed. Normally I would expect a bike to feel “skittery” in situations like that, but this bike felt planted, both front and rear. This one of the best f*cking bikes I have ever ridden. It’s in the “one bike for pretty much everything” category."" ay""You don't have to think about the changing shock leverage. The rear suspension just seems to respond with exactly what is needed in any situation.""Yes, the bike behaved exactly as advertised. Yes, I think it will be my next bike. I'm going to trust that the competency and poise I felt on the short downhill bursts will translate onto bigger terrain. I'm going to believe that the traction and efficiency I felt on these short climbs will carry me up and over the top of something larger. And I have no reason not to."" bz""long story short it's an unbelievable bike. """"The tantrum is different. The first few pedal strokes out the drive way it's instantly noticeable, the bike accelerates faster than any other FS I've ridden. Coming out of corners the bike always seems more composed and faster. The section of trail I rode, lizard, has some bumpy parts where I usually put in a couple of pedal strokes while still going down a -15% hill. The transition to and from bumps and pedaling was completely seamless--even going downhill.""""Going up smooth stuff, it's like it's locked out. Once the bumps start to come, it's still composed, and it's plush over the bumps.""""The crazy thing about it is the grip and what happens at the front end when climbing. The bike just doesn't wander at all. It has crazy grip. I'm used to struggling to pedal up steep stuff while struggling to keep the rear tire from spinning and the front tire on the ground steering. This bike was just easier. """"I went down a trail called rattelsnake, it's a rock garden that's very awkward. it has loose rocks and ruts and there is no rhythm to it. There are narrow rocky chutes and 1-2' successive drop offs that seem perfectly arranged for a maximum OTB launch. I'm always careful riding a bike for the first time and half way down the trail I just realized I could go faster, and then as I picked up speed I realized I could go faster still and wondered why I had gone so slow at the beginning. it was super stable, didn't try and send me over the bars at all and didn't get hung up in any of the holes. """"This bike actually pedals better than a cross country bike and descends as well as an enduro bike. """"This summer is going to be amazing!"" li  Who else is talking?                                             Brandon Turman enjoying a MeltdownVital MTB had a chance to ride it. States Brandon Turman, ""I can confirm that this bike does indeed pedal incredibly well without sacrificing traction in the same manner that many other bikes do""Added Brandon ""On the gas, I was instantly surprised by just how quickly it responded to hard pedal inputs. Even though it has 160mm of travel, it stands up and accelerates with a gusto comparable to a good bike with 50-60mm less travel"""" the corresponding burst of uphill speed was nothing short of impressive. I actually found climbing fun during these sprint efforts. At no point did I notice any harsh pedal feedback while pedaling over bumps. Unlike a hardtail, the rear wheel stayed pretty well glued to the ground through the rough stuff.​""On the Downhills, Turman concludes""the bike has a great ability to maintain speed, in large part thanks to its pedaling traits for those smooth sections of trail between features. In most instances you get the sense that you're on a lighter bike with a low perceived weight.""""It has a precise nature that allows you to change lines easily. """"Those willing to take a risk on a startup and an unproven build might find reward in a revolutionary trail ride."""" ""its design allows for the rear shock to be fully extended on step climbs, all while retaining bump absorption capabilities. This"", says founder Brian Berthold, ""will effectively offer an extra 3 to 4-degrees in steepness at the head tube during a climb that comparable travel bikes.""   Mountain Bikes are generally either good at climbing uphill, or good at absorbing bumps. But the holy grail of MTB suspension design is one that’s good at both.""                       Why start Tantrum Cycles? So you can ride one. It is such an unbelievable joy to have people be able to enjoy your work. Amazingly fulfilling that they can appreciate and OWN something that is the culmination of vast life and professional experience, topped with an unceasing desire to not just improve what is available, but to actually re-imagine what might be possible. And achieve that goal. By supporting Tantrum Cycles, you are helping one man realize his goal of making his designs available, not to everyone, but to discerning riders that actually believe there is more left in the development of modern mountain bike suspension.The video below shows how the horizontal forces on the chainstay interact with the vertical bump forces on the shock.



Missing Link Attributes  

This unique, patent pending, suspension takes all of the force inputs available, from the rider, the terrain, the laws of physics, and provides the best suspension action and frame geometry for those conditions.  
It does this by using a novel (MISSING) link,, which, by reacting to the fore/aft horizontal forces on it, will control the amount and quality of the suspension travel to provide only what is needed for the given conditions. Additionally, it will also provide the optimum geometry available for the conditions.  It can provide a much steeper climbing geometry than you could normally use on an all around bike. Eventually what goes up must come down, so in turn it allows much slacker geometry when the Missing Link allows the suspension to fall into its travel at speed or pointing downhill. The Missing Link does allow the suspension travel to vary from essential zero, under maximum power, to whatever the maximum limit of the bike is, and provide unprecedented ability to absorb bumps for that amount of travel due to the manipulation of the spring force as needed, as well as the initial rearward wheel trajectory.The graph below shows how the Missing Link can modify spring force at the wheel, in either a positive or negative direction, depending on forward acceleration or bump and braking forces. Missing Link Peformance Features    Virtual hardtail on steep, smooth terrain   Very steep climbing geometry (ST and HT) Higher BB when climbing   Instant reaction to bumps, even while climbing   Stiff, short travel suspension with moderate geometry while sprinting on level ground   Instant reaction to bumps, even while sprinting   Slacker geometry at higher speed and/or downhill Very plush suspension reaction to bumps as spring rate falls during initial bump travel   Suspension does not wallow in travel due to ML   Bottomless feel due to rising rate in last part of travel   Initial rearward axle path to further aid square edge bump absorption Immediately slacker geometry upon application of rear brake   Slower “topout” reaction of suspension when encountering a jump lip or other bump that would have a tendency to kick the back up. This is due to the increase in rebound force from sag to full extension, a result of the rapidly changing motion ration in this range of travel. This helps prevent the rider from going over the bars in steep, bumpy terrain. Packaged in a compact design that can be optimized for any specialty and travel range, from full on 10” travel downhill bike to a 29” cross country race bike and everything in between. Offering advantages to each category that until now have been unattainable.   This design utilizes very short, stiff and light links. The ST, BB and main pivot are tied in with the shock mount resulting in high chassis stiffness. This avoids the long, curved links and separation of ST and BB that compromise stiffness of many designs.Modular Design allows multiple configurationsThe modular design of the Meltdown/Outburst series offers many unique advantages.  By changing the bolt-on dropouts, you can use either 142 x 12 OR 148 x 12 Boost wheels. (148 x 12 is standard).  By changing the dropouts, rocker arms, shock and shock mount, Either Meltdown or Outburst frame can be configured into one of 5 different models. With the right parts mix and front fork);  You can turn a standard Meltdown (27.5 x 160 mm travel/160 fork) into:  Meltdown RACE: Slacker geo, 180mm fork, 160 mm rr, 27.5 fr & rrOutburst: 140 mm fork, 125 mm rr, 29” fr and rr  Outburst RACE:: 150 mm fork, slacker geo, 125 mm rear, 29"" fr & rrOutburst XC: Steeper geo, 125 mm fork, 125 mm rr, 29” fr and rrDownburst: 150 mm x 29 front, 165 mm x 27.5 rearThe Outburst can be similarly configured into all models with a parts swap.                                               bolt on dropouts allow modular configurability                                                 Clean, all internal routing for dropper and rear derailleur                                                            External brake line routing                                             Room for Large water bottle in all size frames REWARDS  Note: All indiegogo frames will be hand serialized, signed and noted as indiegogo exclusives.   Frame add on upgradesThe following upgrades can be made to ANY frame award selected.

FSA and Gravity grid make up the majority of other components. These are all long time and highly regarded component companies with stellar reputations.  hubs and wheels have long been a favorite and we're very happy that they have a range of wheels with 30 mm internal width, to fit our group sets.   suspension has worked hand in hand with Tantrum to insure the forks and shocks are optimized to our specifications. While the lower priced versions lack some adjustability, they offer stellar performance for the price. suspension is regarded among the best and most adjustable on the market. 'nuff said. brakes offer excellent performance across the price range, which allows us to offer them exclusively, with the new for 2017 Trail version offering great power, bite and modulation with 4 piston front/2 piston rear calipers. have long been industry standards and personal favorites.Here's a little insight into how we chose the component groups for various backer levels. After very careful consideration, we settled on four build levels.At the lowest priced level, we wanted to offer the best possible value at the lowest price. The caveat was that all of the components had to perform at a base level. That means every component must be cable of serious mountain bike terrain, including extremely technical. They also must be able to survive such use. This is what we came up with. The LowDough. Yes, at this base price, you have to lower your saddle manually (all other builds come with a dropper), but this is a value priced bike you can ride any terrain. These builds are around 30 pounds complete, no pedals  The next level up, the WorkingMan, is indeed, for every discriminating woman or man. This build has important upgrades at almost every component from suspension to brakes to shifters and wheels. A dropper post is also included. The upgrades save weight and improve performance and reliability for the more serious and avid rider, that might more regularly ride tougher terrain. The build is intended to use the ""sweet spot"" of component technology. That is to say, use components that are close enough to the best in order to utilize most of the technology, while avoiding the price. These builds are around 29 pounds with no pedals.  The RACE build is just that. It is intended for the rider that wants to race enduro, or even downhill on their Tantrum. It includes a longer travel, higher performance fork, slacker head tube angle, upgraded rear shock, lighter but stronger wheels and more powerful brakes. A lighter crank and saddle help keep the weight under 29 pounds, no pedals.Now...........enter the DDS. Let's face it, if you can afford it, a top end build kit is SWEET!!! The lightest, strongest, best performing kit available. Featuring carbon rims, crank, handlebar and brake levers, and top line suspension, the SRAM Eagle 12 speed tops off a ride for the most discerning rider with a higher budget. These bikes tip in around 28 pounds, sans pedals.NOTE: In the event of non-availability of a certain component, we reserve the right to substitute with a component of equal or higher value                                                       Meltdown in Illusion Black                                      Reward Build Specification for Meltdown                                                                   Outburst in Blueberry                                         Reward Build Specification for Outburst                                             Reward build specification for Downburst                                   _________________________________________________________Tantrum pint glass.

Berthold remembers “my mandate was to adapt the invention into an existing Kona frame, changing as little as possible. The result was akin to stuffing a V8 into a Chevy Vega (ok a Prius).  But the bikes garnered worldwide critical success and were among the earliest models to sell out. The line spread to 3 models with the G2 version, which was cleaner in every detail, with the shorter travel Abra Cadabra and 2+2 complimenting the big mountain Coilair. Said Berthold “the G2 bikes were a clean sheet of paper, which I really enjoyed designing and working with the factory to innovate new production methods to optimize the design for the Magic Link”  The Magic Link bikes sold well over a 5 year period, garnering over US$40 million in sales and numerous glowing magazine reviews for its suspension performance. Brian knew he could design an even better system. A system with the Magic Link’s advantages of variable geometry and spring rate according to the demands of rider and terrain, but in a more simple layout, lighter, stiffer, easier and cheaper to make, easier to understand and setup and less visually intimidating due to the elimination of the secondary auxiliary shock.  The Missing Link was born, with the added advantages of even more geometry change and the ability to go to infinite stiffness in the rear spring rate, if climbing dictated and smooth surface allowed.  Brian decided to take a different route licensing this design. The exclusive arrangement was just that. It excluded too many brands and people that wanted to enjoy the design. Berthold decided the best way to make it available was to start his own brand. Using a wealth of connections and knowledge accumulated from the bike industry, he formed Tantrum Cycles not only to make the design available to customers, but to promote and license the design to other brands. This would increase the scope of availability. And no matter what the licensees might do, Brian knew that with Tantrum, he was free to offer the bike in whatever configuration he might choose.For a detailed pictorial account of Brian's career, please go to www.brianberthold.com Tantrum Timeline
We are ready for production. After the initial handmade prototype, three more iterations followed during a 3 year product development cycle. With countless hours of riding and testing, the result is the pre-production samples you see here.Actual production of frames will start in Jan 2017, to be delivered in Jul/Aug 2017.Risks and challengesThe mountain bike industry is full of technology and established brands. The biggest challenge is setting yourself apart and proving to people that what we have created isn't just a gimmick.We need to clearly communicate the overwhelming advantages available with the Missing Link suspension. Not marketing hype or jargon, but real world improvements in your daily ride.Of course, starting a bike company out of thin air is a challenge on it's own.To say the least. Thankfully, Tantrum has a wealth of long time industry friends to help and advise, as well as the experience of the founder. These funds will provide very useful cash flow for all phases of this startup.",30.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p><b style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Keeping
the dream alive!</b></p>
<p>So
many of us grow up with dreams as children and even as young adults, most of
these remain unfulfilled though or never even pursued. I have had a lot of
dreams over the years, but sailing around the world was not one of them, until
four years ago when I watched a film called <i>Deep
Water </i>(It was the famous story of the 1968 Golden Globe Race in which ten
amateur sailors attempted to race solo around the world), which sparked my
interest. Most inspirational stories usually have a punch line or good ending,
this one is more about the troubles the men faced at sea physically and
mentally, but it brought a sense of physical awareness and way of thinking I
never experienced. Looking back on it, as I sit here rolling side to side off
the South Coast of Tahiti, I realize that all of these men lacked purpose in
their quest to sail around the world, which is why most of them lost their mind
(literally and figuratively). They were out to achieve a goal that would only
measure themselves and not anyone else, although this was in fact the point of
the race itself! A man by the name of Bernard Moitessier was about to win after
10 months at sea, but he decided to keep sailing all the way to Polynesia, in
almost the exact spot I sit now. He realized that he could easily win both
the cash and title, but returning to his hometown Plymouth would not make him
happy, so he decided to keep on sailing. </p>
<p>I
had just started sailing a few months before when I decided to buy my sailing boat in
2013. The idea was I would get a boat and sail it around the world, but being
solo was not the original intention. It was really a pipe dream fueled by
ambition to do something great and embrace a life that was full of excitement.
My life before this entailed a bit of wanderlust that was filled with all
different walks of life, in a variety of cities across the U.S., so for those
that know me, it was not a surprise that I would take on such an
endeavor. </p>
<p>Once
I learned the basics of sailing, I set off down the Columbia River and landed
in a tiny harbor called Ilwaco. I spent two months in this coastal fishing
town working on the boat, speaking with all kinds of seafaring men, and even
took a sea trial to Greymouth, Washington. While I was not mentally ready for
heading offshore just yet, the boat was well equipped so I decided to press on.
I gathered a couple crew: the previous owner of the boat (a good sailor) and my
girlfriend at the time who never sailed before. It took us 8 days to reach San
Francisco (a long sea trial!)  after enduring heavy winds and seas, and from that point on I knew I could do this…but
not quite alone. In the meantime I fixed the boat up after breaking a number of
things and rounded up another couple crewmembers, who both had never been
offshore. We set off down the coast and eventually arrived in Los Angeles where
they would disembark. Once in Los Angeles I was feeling pretty confident at
this point handling the boat alone, but the Baja Peninsula was still quite
intimidating so I found one crew member and took off to Mexico. Once we reached Cabo
San Lucas, my crewmember was becoming a challenge so I decided it was time to
try being alone and sailed solo into an almost deadly storm. I was stuck with
35+ knot winds and 8-foot seas for over 12 hours, extremely close to shore…but
this was the icebreaker and so off I went!  </p>
<p>I
crossed the Sea of Cortez alone in late February and on April 1st, 2015 I cast
my dock lines off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico to begin a solo circumnavigation
and cross the biggest stretch of Pacific Ocean there is. I was excited and
nervous, but even more anxious for what the adventure would entail. I remember
the feeling of pure joy when the first night settled in and the land slowly
disappeared in the sunset... there was no turning back. </p>
<p> I
didn't understand much about the sea before I left, in terms of sailing, but
had a close relationship with it from a young age, when I witnessed 3 relatives
drown of the coast of Charleston, South Carolina. This taught me the power of Mother
Nature and also to be respectful of the natural environment, but didn't hold me back from learning to surf off the Oregon Coast. Now that I have
sailed over 10,000 miles I have gained a deep affection for the ocean and truly
love being a part of its magic, although sometimes it can be a bit ill tempered
and unforgiving.</p>
<p>Last
year as I made my way through the Pacific, I began to experience a variety of
problems with the boat and later turned out to be more expensive than I had anticipated. After arriving to the Marquesas in April, I noticed my
paint on the side of the hull was peeling back and also had a small crack below
the mast in what they call the bulkhead or mast beam reinforcement. While both
issues were not immediate problems I decided it would be best to haul the boat
in Papeete, Tahiti in July when I arrived. While I was hauled out I found that
the paint on the bottom was in need of complete stripping, along with a
complete rudder rebuild which was delaminating, and the pins holding it to the
boat were completely snapped. </p>
<p>In
order to fix this I had to fly one of my brother's out to help, which was
expensive, but still cheaper then hiring someone at the yard for such a big
undertaking. Over the course of 4 weeks I stripped and repainted the entire
boat, repaired the rudder along with its gudgeons and pinions, replaced two of
the seacocks, replaced the float switch and bilge pump, and tackled a variety
of other small projects. This undertaking cost over $6000 USD and was estimated
by the boat yard owner that it was a $15,000 USD project had I used their
labor, so was well worth the time invested.</p>
<p> Unfortunately
when I was working in the boatyard back in August, a car hit me on my skateboard while running
an errand and left me with a broken left arm, that turned out to be very
problematic (especially when falling off scaffolding two days later and getting
a concussion!). After finishing in the boat yard with a broken arm and getting
Antares settled back in the water, I figured it would be best to leave the
boat. I was in a full cast up to my shoulder and there was no way I would be
sailing anytime soon. The French government here only gives American’s a 3-month
visa and I was already two months overdue. As soon as I was out of my cast they
were going to ask me to leave in the beginning of cyclone season, making it too
dangerous to sail.  </p>
<p>I
decided instead to fly to New Zealand where I could obtain a long-stay visa to
French Polynesia, which would allow me to return with the boat for the
remainder of cyclone season. Part of the reason I chose NZ was to obtain my
Captain's License through the Mahurangi Technical Institute, a well respected maritime training facility. After sailing
almost 10,000 miles the past 2 years I acquired enough sea time to qualify for
my Yachtmaster’s Certificate (Offshore), but it was no easy feat to obtain. The
licenses I received are issued through Royal Yacht Association (RYA) and the
Maritime CoastGuard Agency (MCA), which now allow me to act as a commercial
skipper aboard any sailing vessel up to 200 gross tons. It required attentive
navigation, proper boat handling and docking, and a wide variety of seamanship
skills. It seemed like the right thing to do and now that I have it, I can
secure a job on a boat anywhere around the world. I am hoping that after I
complete my trip I can utilize my experience and licenses to begin my business.
For the time being I am focusing my attention on completing my
circumnavigation, because I have put so much work and time into getting
Antares sea worthy. </p>
<p>Before
I left California I also had some serious upgrades that were necessary for
being single handed and to keep Antares reliable and safe. These upgrades
included a Norvane-Windvane (last one broke!), VHF with AIS (so I can see other
vessels), Garmin Chartplotter &amp; Radar (GPS beats using a sextant!),
200-watts of Solar Power, 4-Person Liferaft (never know!), Satellite Phone
&amp; Rescue EPIRB (to keep in touch with the outside world), &amp; a dinghy so
I could reliably get to shore. While these were all expected expenses before I
left I still have some serious projects to tackle as I continue around the
world. </p>
<p>Antares
is celebrating her 50<sup>th</sup> birthday this year and requires the utmost
attention to detail. Since being in the tropics and enduring weeks of rain and
strong winds, the deck below the mast has begun to separate even more, so I am
going to have to pull the mast at some point in the following months. This is
no small feat I am undertaking and realize there are many risks involved, which
is why I want to make sure things are in working order. To do this I also need
to make sure my main mode of power, the sails, are working efficiently and are
reliable. Right now the main sail (almost 15 years old) has been patched in numerous places and begun
to show signs of serious wear from the tropical heat. The front sail (Jib or
Genoa) was already replaced after it was ripped sailing into Tahiti from the
Tuamotus. I was able to pick up a Genoa from a sailmaker here who had to cut
the hanks (clips) off and sewed the old luff tape onto this sail. While it
works for the time being, it is cut so high that makes trying to attach a pole
to the tack almost impossible, which is not safe while underway in any sort of
heavy seas. </p>
<h3><b><i>NOW THAT I HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL MAKING IT THIS
FAR…HERE IS WHAT'S HAPPENING NEXT! </i></b></h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>It’s
close to 50 years after the Golden Globe Race of 1968 and I share some of the same feelings as
Moitessier once did, and that is not return to the same life I lived before.
For almost two years now and it has given me the chance to explore a variety of
cultures and ways of life, along with learning more about myself. I realize now
that the most important aspect of all this is what you can take away from it.
It’s how you can interact and share ideas with various cultures along the way,
the type of people you influence, and more importantly the people that you
share moments with. I recently graduated with an environmental science degree
in 2014 and focused a lot of my attention on water issues over the past years,
so have learned valuable insight into the major problems that face our society.
As a sailor I see a lot of sailing boats on the water (FACT: over 10,000 ships
are out at sea at any given moment around the world!) yet most of the sailors
don’t set out to assist in anyway or contribute to scientific research, it is
for mere pleasure. Of course sailing for pleasure is the point of the whole thing, but for me I want it to be more than just sailing. One of the coolest and most interesting parts about sailing
around the world though is that you get the chance to visit some of the most remote
places on earth. You can also witness some of the human influence on the sea
such as plastics, coral degradation, water pollution, etc… As I continue my
circumnavigation from this point on, I am going to be focusing my time while on
land and at sea to engage in scientific research or volunteer work that can aid
the communities from an environmental standpoint. </p>
<p>I'm
gearing up to cross sail west to Australia in April and will be making a major
stopover in Fiji for the month of May to assist in a disaster relief effort
from Cyclone Winston. I will be working with the organization called SEA MERCY.
Once I arrive there I we will be repairing and building rainwater catchment
systems along with delivering a variety of tools and supplies. I will
probably spend around 4-8 weeks there assisting in the relief efforts before I
continue on. Including the time I spend volunteering, I will be donating 5% of
all my funds raised directly to a community as the organization see’s fit. </p>
<p>At
the moment I am undecided which route I will to take after Fiji, but the
goal is to sail to South Africa by the end of 2016 and complete the circumnavigation
by mid 2017 (depending on weather, circumstances, and the opportunities that
arise it is all subject to change).  This means I have a lot of sailing to do in the following months
so here is the tentative plan…</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>April – June 2016 – Tahiti to Fiji (Assist in disaster relief)</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>June – August 2016 – Fiji to Cairns, Australia (Volunteering or
other opportunities to conduct research along the way)</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>September – November 2016 – Australia to South Africa (Refit in Australia)</p>
<p>**<i>I will bypass
the Suez Canal Due to potential instability in the region and the fact I will be
sailing alone makes it dangerous with the amount of traffic.</i></p>
<p>o<span>  </span>December 2016 – January 2017 – South Africa to Brazil</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>March – April 2017 – Brazil to Caribbean </p>
<p>o<span>  </span>April  - June 2017 –
Caribbean to La Paz, Mexico</p>
<h3><b>SO
WHAT'S ALL THIS MONEY FOR? </b></h3>

<p>I'm
not going to lie, this whole sailing business is a lot more expensive than I
expected, which is where your generosity and support comes in. I am working on developing
Lifeline Explorers into a full-fledged business by the end of this trip, but in
the meantime I have no income except for some side projects for friends boats.  As Charles Bukowski said,<i>""If you
are going to try, go all the way, otherwise don't even start"". </i>With that said, I don't think now is the time to stop this trip.
The way I see it is I have the boat, my health, desire, and knowledge …I just need
your help to finish!</p> <b><i>How much money do I need?</i></b>: $12,000

<h3><b><span>Why
You Should Help?</span></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Sailing
     is one of the last great adventures you can take besides flying to the
     moon. It is like being on a different planet at times. Through sailing
     I've had the opportunity to touch, see, feel, swim and photograph in some
     of the most remote, rugged, and isolated destinations in the world. In
     each of these mind-blowing locations I've had the chance to share my
     stories and knowledge with others, and even more importantly, I've been
     given the unique opportunities to meet the locals and get a glimpse of
     what their local culture is all about - probably the single most important
     part of this trip overall has been learning about the native people and
     cultures in French Polynesia. Many of the places I will be visiting along
     the way live a life not connected to the Western world and it has and will
     continue to provide me a chance to share ideas and explore the values of
     their culture. My experience learning about these cultures will be
     followed-up with stories and video reports available on my YouTube channel
     and website.  </li>
<li>I'm
     currently involved with disaster relief projects in Fiji, and looking to work with a number of other organizations. I'm all ears for any other
     volunteer or philanthropic opportunities so if you want to recommend a
     worthy organization feel free to send information my way! <a href=""mailto:Justin@lifelineexplorers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><i><span>Justin@lifelineexplorers.com</span></i></b></a><b></b>
</li>
<li>You
     can follow my journey by watching my video logs and short documentaries on
     my website.  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>While
     there are always risks involved with sailing around the world solo, the
     biggest concern is that this investment could all be gone in a moment.
     Because of Antares' age and that fact that I am sailing solo, I'm unable to get her insured. Although I do everything I can to
     keep her safe, sometimes it is at the mercy of mother nature. The only thing I can do to insure that she remains afloat and is having things like the mast, deck and sails in working order. </li>
</ul>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>·<span>  </span>I know sometimes you can't financially help or for that matter
don't feel it is for           <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">you to support the cause. But if you like my story or have

Keeping
the dream alive!
So
many of us grow up with dreams as children and even as young adults, most of
these remain unfulfilled though or never even pursued. I have had a lot of
dreams over the years, but sailing around the world was not one of them, until
four years ago when I watched a film called Deep
Water (It was the famous story of the 1968 Golden Globe Race in which ten
amateur sailors attempted to race solo around the world), which sparked my
interest. Most inspirational stories usually have a punch line or good ending,
this one is more about the troubles the men faced at sea physically and
mentally, but it brought a sense of physical awareness and way of thinking I
never experienced. Looking back on it, as I sit here rolling side to side off
the South Coast of Tahiti, I realize that all of these men lacked purpose in
their quest to sail around the world, which is why most of them lost their mind
(literally and figuratively). They were out to achieve a goal that would only
measure themselves and not anyone else, although this was in fact the point of
the race itself! A man by the name of Bernard Moitessier was about to win after
10 months at sea, but he decided to keep sailing all the way to Polynesia, in
almost the exact spot I sit now. He realized that he could easily win both
the cash and title, but returning to his hometown Plymouth would not make him
happy, so he decided to keep on sailing. 
I
had just started sailing a few months before when I decided to buy my sailing boat in
2013. The idea was I would get a boat and sail it around the world, but being
solo was not the original intention. It was really a pipe dream fueled by
ambition to do something great and embrace a life that was full of excitement.
My life before this entailed a bit of wanderlust that was filled with all
different walks of life, in a variety of cities across the U.S., so for those
that know me, it was not a surprise that I would take on such an
endeavor. 
Once
I learned the basics of sailing, I set off down the Columbia River and landed
in a tiny harbor called Ilwaco. I spent two months in this coastal fishing
town working on the boat, speaking with all kinds of seafaring men, and even
took a sea trial to Greymouth, Washington. While I was not mentally ready for
heading offshore just yet, the boat was well equipped so I decided to press on.
I gathered a couple crew: the previous owner of the boat (a good sailor) and my
girlfriend at the time who never sailed before. It took us 8 days to reach San
Francisco (a long sea trial!)  after enduring heavy winds and seas, and from that point on I knew I could do this…but
not quite alone. In the meantime I fixed the boat up after breaking a number of
things and rounded up another couple crewmembers, who both had never been
offshore. We set off down the coast and eventually arrived in Los Angeles where
they would disembark. Once in Los Angeles I was feeling pretty confident at
this point handling the boat alone, but the Baja Peninsula was still quite
intimidating so I found one crew member and took off to Mexico. Once we reached Cabo
San Lucas, my crewmember was becoming a challenge so I decided it was time to
try being alone and sailed solo into an almost deadly storm. I was stuck with
35+ knot winds and 8-foot seas for over 12 hours, extremely close to shore…but
this was the icebreaker and so off I went!  
I
crossed the Sea of Cortez alone in late February and on April 1st, 2015 I cast
my dock lines off from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico to begin a solo circumnavigation
and cross the biggest stretch of Pacific Ocean there is. I was excited and
nervous, but even more anxious for what the adventure would entail. I remember
the feeling of pure joy when the first night settled in and the land slowly
disappeared in the sunset... there was no turning back. 
 I
didn't understand much about the sea before I left, in terms of sailing, but
had a close relationship with it from a young age, when I witnessed 3 relatives
drown of the coast of Charleston, South Carolina. This taught me the power of Mother
Nature and also to be respectful of the natural environment, but didn't hold me back from learning to surf off the Oregon Coast. Now that I have
sailed over 10,000 miles I have gained a deep affection for the ocean and truly
love being a part of its magic, although sometimes it can be a bit ill tempered
and unforgiving.
Last
year as I made my way through the Pacific, I began to experience a variety of
problems with the boat and later turned out to be more expensive than I had anticipated. After arriving to the Marquesas in April, I noticed my
paint on the side of the hull was peeling back and also had a small crack below
the mast in what they call the bulkhead or mast beam reinforcement. While both
issues were not immediate problems I decided it would be best to haul the boat
in Papeete, Tahiti in July when I arrived. While I was hauled out I found that
the paint on the bottom was in need of complete stripping, along with a
complete rudder rebuild which was delaminating, and the pins holding it to the
boat were completely snapped. 
In
order to fix this I had to fly one of my brother's out to help, which was
expensive, but still cheaper then hiring someone at the yard for such a big
undertaking. Over the course of 4 weeks I stripped and repainted the entire
boat, repaired the rudder along with its gudgeons and pinions, replaced two of
the seacocks, replaced the float switch and bilge pump, and tackled a variety
of other small projects. This undertaking cost over $6000 USD and was estimated
by the boat yard owner that it was a $15,000 USD project had I used their
labor, so was well worth the time invested.
 Unfortunately
when I was working in the boatyard back in August, a car hit me on my skateboard while running
an errand and left me with a broken left arm, that turned out to be very
problematic (especially when falling off scaffolding two days later and getting
a concussion!). After finishing in the boat yard with a broken arm and getting
Antares settled back in the water, I figured it would be best to leave the
boat. I was in a full cast up to my shoulder and there was no way I would be
sailing anytime soon. The French government here only gives American’s a 3-month
visa and I was already two months overdue. As soon as I was out of my cast they
were going to ask me to leave in the beginning of cyclone season, making it too
dangerous to sail.  
I
decided instead to fly to New Zealand where I could obtain a long-stay visa to
French Polynesia, which would allow me to return with the boat for the
remainder of cyclone season. Part of the reason I chose NZ was to obtain my
Captain's License through the Mahurangi Technical Institute, a well respected maritime training facility. After sailing
almost 10,000 miles the past 2 years I acquired enough sea time to qualify for
my Yachtmaster’s Certificate (Offshore), but it was no easy feat to obtain. The
licenses I received are issued through Royal Yacht Association (RYA) and the
Maritime CoastGuard Agency (MCA), which now allow me to act as a commercial
skipper aboard any sailing vessel up to 200 gross tons. It required attentive
navigation, proper boat handling and docking, and a wide variety of seamanship
skills. It seemed like the right thing to do and now that I have it, I can
secure a job on a boat anywhere around the world. I am hoping that after I
complete my trip I can utilize my experience and licenses to begin my business.
For the time being I am focusing my attention on completing my
circumnavigation, because I have put so much work and time into getting
Antares sea worthy. 
Before
I left California I also had some serious upgrades that were necessary for
being single handed and to keep Antares reliable and safe. These upgrades
included a Norvane-Windvane (last one broke!), VHF with AIS (so I can see other
vessels), Garmin Chartplotter & Radar (GPS beats using a sextant!),
200-watts of Solar Power, 4-Person Liferaft (never know!), Satellite Phone
& Rescue EPIRB (to keep in touch with the outside world), & a dinghy so
I could reliably get to shore. While these were all expected expenses before I
left I still have some serious projects to tackle as I continue around the
world. 
Antares
is celebrating her 50th birthday this year and requires the utmost
attention to detail. Since being in the tropics and enduring weeks of rain and
strong winds, the deck below the mast has begun to separate even more, so I am
going to have to pull the mast at some point in the following months. This is
no small feat I am undertaking and realize there are many risks involved, which
is why I want to make sure things are in working order. To do this I also need
to make sure my main mode of power, the sails, are working efficiently and are
reliable. Right now the main sail (almost 15 years old) has been patched in numerous places and begun
to show signs of serious wear from the tropical heat. The front sail (Jib or
Genoa) was already replaced after it was ripped sailing into Tahiti from the
Tuamotus. I was able to pick up a Genoa from a sailmaker here who had to cut
the hanks (clips) off and sewed the old luff tape onto this sail. While it
works for the time being, it is cut so high that makes trying to attach a pole
to the tack almost impossible, which is not safe while underway in any sort of
heavy seas. 
NOW THAT I HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL MAKING IT THIS
FAR…HERE IS WHAT'S HAPPENING NEXT! 

It’s
close to 50 years after the Golden Globe Race of 1968 and I share some of the same feelings as
Moitessier once did, and that is not return to the same life I lived before.
For almost two years now and it has given me the chance to explore a variety of
cultures and ways of life, along with learning more about myself. I realize now
that the most important aspect of all this is what you can take away from it.
It’s how you can interact and share ideas with various cultures along the way,
the type of people you influence, and more importantly the people that you
share moments with. I recently graduated with an environmental science degree
in 2014 and focused a lot of my attention on water issues over the past years,
so have learned valuable insight into the major problems that face our society.
As a sailor I see a lot of sailing boats on the water (FACT: over 10,000 ships
are out at sea at any given moment around the world!) yet most of the sailors
don’t set out to assist in anyway or contribute to scientific research, it is
for mere pleasure. Of course sailing for pleasure is the point of the whole thing, but for me I want it to be more than just sailing. One of the coolest and most interesting parts about sailing
around the world though is that you get the chance to visit some of the most remote
places on earth. You can also witness some of the human influence on the sea
such as plastics, coral degradation, water pollution, etc… As I continue my
circumnavigation from this point on, I am going to be focusing my time while on
land and at sea to engage in scientific research or volunteer work that can aid
the communities from an environmental standpoint. 
I'm
gearing up to cross sail west to Australia in April and will be making a major
stopover in Fiji for the month of May to assist in a disaster relief effort
from Cyclone Winston. I will be working with the organization called SEA MERCY.
Once I arrive there I we will be repairing and building rainwater catchment
systems along with delivering a variety of tools and supplies. I will
probably spend around 4-8 weeks there assisting in the relief efforts before I
continue on. Including the time I spend volunteering, I will be donating 5% of
all my funds raised directly to a community as the organization see’s fit. 
At
the moment I am undecided which route I will to take after Fiji, but the
goal is to sail to South Africa by the end of 2016 and complete the circumnavigation
by mid 2017 (depending on weather, circumstances, and the opportunities that
arise it is all subject to change).  This means I have a lot of sailing to do in the following months
so here is the tentative plan…
o  April – June 2016 – Tahiti to Fiji (Assist in disaster relief)
o  June – August 2016 – Fiji to Cairns, Australia (Volunteering or
other opportunities to conduct research along the way)
o  September – November 2016 – Australia to South Africa (Refit in Australia)
**I will bypass
the Suez Canal Due to potential instability in the region and the fact I will be
sailing alone makes it dangerous with the amount of traffic.
o  December 2016 – January 2017 – South Africa to Brazil
o  March – April 2017 – Brazil to Caribbean 
o  April  - June 2017 –
Caribbean to La Paz, Mexico
SO
WHAT'S ALL THIS MONEY FOR? 

I'm
not going to lie, this whole sailing business is a lot more expensive than I
expected, which is where your generosity and support comes in. I am working on developing
Lifeline Explorers into a full-fledged business by the end of this trip, but in
the meantime I have no income except for some side projects for friends boats.  As Charles Bukowski said,""If you
are going to try, go all the way, otherwise don't even start"". With that said, I don't think now is the time to stop this trip.
The way I see it is I have the boat, my health, desire, and knowledge …I just need
your help to finish! How much money do I need?: $12,000



What's it going to be used for?:  

New
     Mainsail: $2500 
New
     Headsail / Genoa: $1500 

        **Sailmaker to be used is undetermined at this point, quality and price will be                  evaluated after funds are raised** 


Watermaker:
     $2000
Deck
     / Mast Repair: $1000
Any
     remaining funds will be used for food, supplies, and visiting costs in
     other countries. 
NOTE: IndieGoGo
     & transaction costs total around 8% of funds raised so my funding goal
     is higher because of this.

Why
You Should Help?

Sailing
     is one of the last great adventures you can take besides flying to the
     moon. It is like being on a different planet at times. Through sailing
     I've had the opportunity to touch, see, feel, swim and photograph in some
     of the most remote, rugged, and isolated destinations in the world. In
     each of these mind-blowing locations I've had the chance to share my
     stories and knowledge with others, and even more importantly, I've been
     given the unique opportunities to meet the locals and get a glimpse of
     what their local culture is all about - probably the single most important
     part of this trip overall has been learning about the native people and
     cultures in French Polynesia. Many of the places I will be visiting along
     the way live a life not connected to the Western world and it has and will
     continue to provide me a chance to share ideas and explore the values of
     their culture. My experience learning about these cultures will be
     followed-up with stories and video reports available on my YouTube channel
     and website.  
I'm
     currently involved with disaster relief projects in Fiji, and looking to work with a number of other organizations. I'm all ears for any other
     volunteer or philanthropic opportunities so if you want to recommend a
     worthy organization feel free to send information my way! Justin@lifelineexplorers.com

You
     can follow my journey by watching my video logs and short documentaries on
     my website.  

Risks
& Challenges

While
     there are always risks involved with sailing around the world solo, the
     biggest concern is that this investment could all be gone in a moment.
     Because of Antares' age and that fact that I am sailing solo, I'm unable to get her insured. Although I do everything I can to
     keep her safe, sometimes it is at the mercy of mother nature. The only thing I can do to insure that she remains afloat and is having things like the mast, deck and sails in working order.

Other Ways You Can Help
·  I know sometimes you can't financially help or for that matter
don't feel it is for           you to support the cause. But if you like my story or have
a friend, family              or coworker with wanderlust who might want to live vicariously
through me - please forward this on to them! I would greatly appreciate it! I
have a feeling it's going to take a lot of work to raise the funds necessary
for this trip and anything you're willing to contribute is much appreciated!

I’m pretty sure my previous Lumos helmet saved my life before. The Ultra feels like a totally normal helmet. The price is reasonable for any helmet and it looks like a helmet I would buy even if it didn’t have lights. Throw in the lights and it’s totally a no-brainer! Everyone should have one! — <strong>David Rolfe, San Francisco</strong></i></p><p><br/><i>It’s obvious that Lumos Ultra was built on love and experience.<br/>I have been following Lumos products since the first helmet came out on Kickstarter, and I believe the Ultra is the best one yet. It looks really cool, is super comfortable to wear, and feels very light on my head. As a surgeon, I have to go to the hospital at odd hours, lots of midnights and early mornings.. Since I’ve had the Ultra helmet, I am more confident in cycling to work. The bright lights and turn signals makes me feel more visible on the road, and visible is safe! In broad daylight, the smooth design and good-looking colors turns a lot of heads! — <strong>Petra Wahjoepramono, Indonesia</strong></i></p><p><br/><i>Are you are looking for a helmet that gives you the best protection both day and night?

You can control the turn signals on Lumos Ultra by simply raising your arm.Keep the sun and rain out of your eyes while you ride with an optional attachable visor. Lumos Ultra will also come with an option to add MIPS. This is an extra safety feature that is built into the helmet to add protection against rotational motion transferred to the brain. Rotational motion affects the brain and increase the risk for minor and severe brain injuries.   Chips On Board (COB) is a method of LED packaging which has a number of advantages over more conventional technologies. It allows for a more compact footprint whilst delivering a higher intensity of light meaning you’ll be seen from further away. It is also what gives the lights a more uniform look. We like to think of it as Currently Our Best LED technology.  It’s our most vented helmet yet. We’ve been listening to customer feedback and have paid very close attention to the way Ultra directs air through its internal venting system. We’ve created 3 enormous exhausts in the rear to ensure hot air gets pushed out helping to keep the rider cool whether on a commute or on a training session.  We’ve already done the initial crash tests on our beta units and they pass with plenty of safety margin to spare. We’re confident that Ultra will be one of the safest helmets on road even without the lights on.  When you ride, you must be prepared to ride in any weather. That's why Ultra is built to IPX6 standards, to withstand the elements and keep you riding bright, come rain or shine.  We've worked really hard to improve the weight of our smart helmets. By using more efficient manufacturing methods, we were able to use less material without compromising the high level of protection that our helmets provide. Our very first helmet weighed in at 490 grams, Ultra is estimated to have a final weight of 370 grams. Now that's a big win (or loss).  There are multiple benefits to wearing lights high up on the head. Firstly, it makes it possible to be seen more clearly by motorists on the road. You're less likely to encounter a situation where your lights are being blocked by parked cars or other things on the road. Secondly, by illuminating your head, it's much easier for motorists to see where you're looking and thus know approach more carefully.   Ultra is the helmet for everyone, from kids to even bigger kids. It is available in the sizes S, M-L and XL, and they are all equipped with a click-dial fit system to ensure that Ultra sits firmly yet comfortably on your head.
Small (S): 51-55 cm / 20-21.6 in
Medium to Large (M-L): 54-61 cm / 21.3-24 in
Extra Large (XL): 61-65 cm / 24-25.6 in
   

   Despite starting with a design brief of creating the successor to the wildly popular Kickstart helmet, but at half the cost, the design of Ultra has been a labour of love. We could’ve just taken the simpler approach of cutting costs from the Kickstart helmet, but we wanted to create a helmet that takes all of our learnings from building smart wearables and push the limits of helmet design to completely new heights. We’ve agonized over all the small details refining them to the point where they’d feel more at home on a $200+ helmet.Just a few of the things we’ve considered include a design that’s not too overstated, yet exudes style. We’ve taken an even more focused user-centric approach to consider useful extras such as the sun visor and overall weight, as well as taking a keen interest in venting to help keep the head cool on more demanding rides. We’re super stoked about how the design has progressed over Ultra’s development cycle, and know that our customers will appreciate the attention to detail once they get the product in their hands.  From sketches, to CAD, to 3D printed models and design validation beta prototypes, we are now in the final stages of the design process. We are collecting tons of valuable feedback and are working on refinements to release the perfect product. With each new version, we get closer to the ultimate helmet for cycling.We've completed our beta testing phase. These are some of the pictures and feedback we've gotten from our beta testers.Better styling, amazing air flow and a shockingly lower price. Lumos Ultra really deserves the name, and frankly should be selling like hot cakes. The Lumos Ultra shows how the brand has matured from its Kickstarter roots into an established and innovative company. — James Gill, Nuneaton, UKHonestly having lights on your helmet is life changing.. The thing I like best is that if I have any doubt about whether a driver has seen me, I can look at them or their rear view mirror and know the light will flash right at them. — Caterina Buizza, London, UKNot only will you will be investing in your safety, but you will also be getting a premium helmet. Ultra is light and breathable. It’s innovative, giving you THAT thing that other helmets are missing. I love how it looks awesome and really feels great. — Francisco Garcia, New YorkFor anyone that was on the fence with the previous products due to price, hopefully this new version makes the decision much easier. Just as effective as the previous versions in terms of safety (see and be seen), but with a sleek new design and more accessible price point? What’s not to like….! — John Yu, San FranciscoThis is by far the best helmet if you want great protective gear, slick looks -and- lights. With the lights on your head they are above car roofs so they can always be seen. The cool look, the ventilation and the lightweight, non-bothering fit makes this my A+ choice for my 100 k per day commute as well as for ride my race bike or going on trails with my kids. — Henrik Becker, GermanyI love the concept of the Lumos helmet. I’m pretty sure my previous Lumos helmet saved my life before. The Ultra feels like a totally normal helmet. The price is reasonable for any helmet and it looks like a helmet I would buy even if it didn’t have lights. Throw in the lights and it’s totally a no-brainer! Everyone should have one! — David Rolfe, San FranciscoIt’s obvious that Lumos Ultra was built on love and experience.I have been following Lumos products since the first helmet came out on Kickstarter, and I believe the Ultra is the best one yet. It looks really cool, is super comfortable to wear, and feels very light on my head. As a surgeon, I have to go to the hospital at odd hours, lots of midnights and early mornings.. Since I’ve had the Ultra helmet, I am more confident in cycling to work. The bright lights and turn signals makes me feel more visible on the road, and visible is safe! In broad daylight, the smooth design and good-looking colors turns a lot of heads! — Petra Wahjoepramono, IndonesiaAre you are looking for a helmet that gives you the best protection both day and night? Look no further! Lumos Ultra is lightweight, high quality, durable and has the most awesome front and tail lights customization that other similar helmets only can only dream of. — Stijn Buyse, BelgiumThis is the Tesla of bike helmets. Style functionality, safety features and comfort. It’s unlike any helmet I have seen on the road. This is the future of bike helmets. — Grant Leslie, Australia  Note:Due to the large order of helmets currently, we cannot ship all the helmets at the same time. Hence the long duration of Mass Production to Delivery from Sept 2020 to April 2021, during which we will ship out helmets weekly.*Helmets for Indiegogo/In-Demand customers will likely have their helmets shipped out starting early 2021.As this is an estimate, timelines may get pushed up or pushed back but we will give our 100% to make sure that things are completed on, or even ahead of schedule. At the end of the campaign, we will send you a Backerkit survey via email.From there, you will be able to choose your: Color, MIPS-add on, size, visor and other add-ons we might release throughout the campaign.MIPSIf you have already purchased the Lumos Ultra MIPS reward, you will not need to add MIPS in the survey. It will be assigned to you automatically.However, if you have bought the standard Lumos Ultra, you will still be able to purchase the MIPS add-on for the difference in price between the rewards.SizeWe will be launching Ultra in small (S: 51-55 cm/20-21.6 in), medium to large (M-L: 54-61 cm/21.3-24 in) and extra large sizes (XL: 61-65 cm/24-25.6 in) so that anyone from kids to adults can have an Ultra. You will be able to choose the size you want through the Backerkit survey we send you at the end of the campaign.VisorYou will also be able to add on the attachable visor if you decide that you need one for your daily ride. The visor will retail for $25, but for this campaign, we are launching it at only $14.95.Other add-onsWe are currently working on some Lumos merchandise, ranging from other cycling gear to everyday wear items. Once we lock down the designs and start building prototypes, we will share them with you! You will also be able to buy these add-ons through the Backerkit survey. Shipping, Taxes (and VAT) will be calculated and paid for towards the end of the campaign, before we ship the helmets out to you. During these uncertain times, shipping costs have gone up significantly, however, we do believe that the prices will go down as the situation gets better globally.Hence, we do not think charging shipping right now, upon pledging is at the interest of our supporters as the prices today might be more expensive than that in a few months time.Here are our estimates of what shipping would be.* Prices do not include taxes and VAT. That will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country. ** Note that these prices are dependent on the situation and may increase or decrease by a few dollars in the months to come.""I don't see my country as a shipping option"" : If you do not see your country as a shipping option, it means that we currently do not offer shipping to that country.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544805435/pucbgdymrptxm3pjmwce.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Hi!! Thank you for stopping at our page.  I, Michael a US Navy veteran,  currently own and operate a local market. The land we would like to develop was in a distressed state when purchased.  Even then the serenity and beauty of the area was clearly seen but the town and surrounding area needs attention.  The local market we now operate was on the brink of closure thus continuing the downward projection of development and opportunity in this rural desert community.  We couldn't allow the only market in town to close and so took on the ownership and management.  The market is now a pride of the community but still a small portion of what is needed.   </li>
<li><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540956458/j8gjw9v609lg3ozs2xjn.jpg"" src=""""/></li>
<li>The only store in town.  We understand the lack of opportunity present in the area which is causing a burden on the community and the local government.  There is nature tourism but it mostly passes through this unique town of Ranchita.  Ranchita has a lot to offer and much room to grow in order to support the community.</li>
<li><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544806445/grh5umxm3wu2fthsvk2g.jpg"" src=""""/></li>
<li>We have invested all our savings into the local market but we can't stop there.  The project vision is possible with community support and capital.  We have spread the word to the community and they love it, all that is left is to raise funds to get the project started and the community working.  North Mountain area of San Diego County is breathtaking.  Amazing views, great weather, and untapped potential.  Secret gem for those within and outside the county as a place to visit and relish the outdoors.  But lacking in many ways for the residents of this rural desert community hoping to stay but unable to find stable work  or bright future for the community.  This project will create opportunity for the community while preserving and enhancing nature tourism.This  project fits right in with the county future plans for sustainable smart agriculture to both develop and maintain the local characteristic.   When our business becomes fully operational the profits will feed into a private foundation dedicated  community development projects.  These projects will focus on education, local commerce business development, and sustainable infrastructure. </li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>This project will need to be funded in phases.  The first phase is the design and planting.  This phase will primarily consist of engineering drawing plans, government zone permitting, tree planting, fresh water fish ponds.<ul>
<li>We know the main features but experts are needed to provide specific guidance.  We want everything that will be built or grown on the orchard to mesh well with the local vegetation and in no way adversely affect the ecosystem. $30,000</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary


Hi!! Thank you for stopping at our page.  I, Michael a US Navy veteran,  currently own and operate a local market. The land we would like to develop was in a distressed state when purchased.  Even then the serenity and beauty of the area was clearly seen but the town and surrounding area needs attention.  The local market we now operate was on the brink of closure thus continuing the downward projection of development and opportunity in this rural desert community.  We couldn't allow the only market in town to close and so took on the ownership and management.  The market is now a pride of the community but still a small portion of what is needed.   

The only store in town.  We understand the lack of opportunity present in the area which is causing a burden on the community and the local government.  There is nature tourism but it mostly passes through this unique town of Ranchita.  Ranchita has a lot to offer and much room to grow in order to support the community.

We have invested all our savings into the local market but we can't stop there.  The project vision is possible with community support and capital.  We have spread the word to the community and they love it, all that is left is to raise funds to get the project started and the community working.  North Mountain area of San Diego County is breathtaking.  Amazing views, great weather, and untapped potential.  Secret gem for those within and outside the county as a place to visit and relish the outdoors.  But lacking in many ways for the residents of this rural desert community hoping to stay but unable to find stable work  or bright future for the community.  This project will create opportunity for the community while preserving and enhancing nature tourism.This  project fits right in with the county future plans for sustainable smart agriculture to both develop and maintain the local characteristic.   When our business becomes fully operational the profits will feed into a private foundation dedicated  community development projects.  These projects will focus on education, local commerce business development, and sustainable infrastructure. 



 
What We Need & What You Get

This project will need to be funded in phases.  The first phase is the design and planting.  This phase will primarily consist of engineering drawing plans, government zone permitting, tree planting, fresh water fish ponds.
We know the main features but experts are needed to provide specific guidance.  We want everything that will be built or grown on the orchard to mesh well with the local vegetation and in no way adversely affect the ecosystem. $30,000

The government is a huge hurtle for everything and we have done our research on what can be done without major permits and what is required.  The use of caves for lodging we believe is required in order to preserve the vast unhampered views of the desert.  But it will also be a challenge permitting wise.  We will need structural engineers working with the building department.  $60,000

Good thing we don't need permission to plant trees.  We have a nursery of trees but we are no where close to what will be needed to cover 60 acres.  Tree planting coincides with the pond creation for the fish and shellfish.   $500,000 for trees, $100,000 for ponds.

 
The fresh water fish and shellfish we plan to rear are  prawns, crabs, and whitefish.  This will be semi-intensive with focus on locally sourced fish feed.  This means that we intend to either grow the ingredients needed to supplement the natural ecosystem within the pond or support a local farmer to become part of the supply chain.  Our ponds will not be crammed and the water serves as a natural fertilizer for the near-by trees.  This is a system of systems operation.

 
We have two locations which affords us the opportunity to grow slightly different climate trees and shrubs that will be used to make both alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages. Ranchita is a cooler climate so the trees will be mostly fruit and nut trees that require a defined cold season.  All must be drought tolerant.  Our main nursery location is in Ramona which is a bit warmer.  This is where we will start the young trees and also grow subtropical trees for beverages and other products.






We truly appreciate your time and interest.  This project is unique and  just bubbling with love and good times. Our perks will be the same, a project you will have the ability to be part of, own a piece of and experience the gratitude we have to offer.  Thank you   

If we are unable to reach our goals we will still move on with the project.  It would takes us longer and probably include selling some portion of the project but the goal is solid and we plan to reach it.

The Impact

Your contribution will not only change my life but the the lives of over 3,000 people that call the this North Mountain area of San Diego their home.  This outdoor destination project is the catalyst to uplift the community and improve the economic outlook.   

Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk and challenge for this project is government approval.  Originally when we started we thought that maybe the locals might not want this in their neighborhood, because it is a very rural town with no commercial business besides the market.  But we were wrong.  The more locals we spoke to the more we realized they want this project just as much as we do.   Owning a market has opened my eyes to the battles with permitting and licensing.  Its not for the faint at heart.  But seeing that our vision aligns with the county's future development plan we are positive on the outcome.  The key is to be tenacious and consistent.  We've learned so much from operating the market.  The government rules and regulations are meant to help and its best to keep positive, ask lots of questions, and don't stop calling for status updates.  It helps :D

The next biggest risk is the wildfire danger.  This a very real and present threat that we are very aware of and plan to design into the layout of the orchard possible ways to minimize damage and increase recovery.  Fire prevention and defense will be designed into our orchard layout, we will work with a specialist to provide guidance and advice.

I’ve gone back every year since to sail or stay in an island villa, but there’s been one consistent challenge: planning the trip. Making selections from dozens of islands, hundreds of villas and boats, arranging transportation, lodging, activities, dining, and making sure that the trip meets my original vision. After ten years and twelve islands, the planning has never gotten any easier. I formed Regatta to solve this problem and make these vacations readily accessible to the rapidly growing population of affluent, high net-worth individuals who desire them.

Making selections from dozens of islands, hundreds of villas and boats, arranging transportation, lodging, activities, dining, and making sure that the trip meets my original vision. After ten years and twelve islands, the planning has never gotten any easier. I formed Regatta to solve this problem and make these vacations readily accessible to the rapidly growing population of affluent, high net-worth individuals who desire them. """"Join us - where life meets the sea, relaxation meets luxury, and where the wind will revitalize your spirit - I promise that a Regatta trip will change your life,” WilliamRegatta makes these truly unique and life-changing vacations readily accessible for busy, affluent families. There is nothing like experiencing life from a crisp infinity pool overlooking a sunset or peacefully riding the wind in our massive sailing and power boats. We enable our customers to share their vision, then our technology compares thousands of islands, villas/boats, and vibes until we find the perfect one for them.Sifting through dozens of islands and hundreds of boats and villas is a wasted effort if the choices don’t provide the activities you wish to enjoy. Arrive on an island that doesn’t have beaches? Arrive to a town that doesn’t have shopping? Find yourself on a boat without scuba or fishing equipment? All these are possible, but Waypoint ensures you get to experience the tropics without heartbreak.How Waypoint WorksWaypoint is our AI-based engine that provides the backbone to our activity-based approach to travel planning. It is radically different and makes the planning process enjoyable, simple, and highly effective.  Waypoint pulls from thousands of options to design a trip guaranteed to fulfill your dreams.When first arriving at Waypoint, users are prompted to select the desired vacation activities they wish to experience. The user selects: the time frame, number of beds, target budget, and the activities they wish to partake in. Once you have selected your preferences, the search engine matches available yachts and villas detailing potential activities you can do. The results will detail the top 3 locations that most suit your desired activities and the optimal boat and/or villa to support your trip! They can tweak the options and compare results. From there, the user is prompted to create a consultation booking with one of our excellent concierge representatives and a custom itinerary will be created for you!Head to www.regatta.travel to explore!At Regatta Travel we offer the best sailing catamarans, sexy power-cats, out-of-this-world yachts, and the magnificent views and indoor-outdoor living of luxury villas. Using our unique activity-based approach to travel we get them to the places that excel in the activities they want to experience. Rather than the typical long list of vacation options, they choose the vacation experience they desire, then we identify the island destination and accommodations that meet their needs (and vibe) for a private, covid-safe, and truly unforgettable experience.Help put wind in our sails so that we can radically change the travel industry. Help us make these life-changing getaways possible and you’ll earn discounts and free days for your own out of this world excursion!We are seeking your help in raising $500,000 to help Regatta Travel:

I could have fit all my gear into my large duffel except that my daypack didn't fit well, so I was forced to carry it outside like a dope. The problem distracted from the amazing places we visited. When I got back I looked at the available options only to find packs that were too simple, too small, or too expensive. The gears in my head started turning and I started researching to find and solve the problems found in packable daypacks available on the market.</p><p>Here I am in Zurich thinking about an easier way to do things:</p><div data-caption=""Walking around like this even for a little while is frustrating and makes you vulnerable to pickpocketers."" data-id=""25385115""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Walking around like this even for a little while is frustrating and makes you vulnerable to pickpocketers."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1561657275/mcndh0couckm04pmxlfq.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p>Walking around like this even for a little while is frustrating and makes you vulnerable to pickpocketers.</p>

The anti-theft pockets cannot be reached by anyone without swinging the pack to your side, which allows for easy access of your valuables.
 Keep your valuables hidden and touching your back, where you can feel that they are secure.
 
Nobody has access to the pockets against your back except for you. Gear Access That Makes Sense  
  
The roll to lets you easily take gear in and out.

Quick access through the side vertical zipper (sealed).
 The roll top opens wide for easy stuffing of your pack with all your gear, while the sealed side zipper allows for easy access without having to open the top again. It's the best of both worlds!  Premium, Low Profile Materials   Only the highest quality materials are used for the daypack. The main fabric is an incredibly strong 30D Nylon Ripstop, with a DWR water resistant coating. This will keep water out, scratches off, and will last a long time. Every zipper is water sealed and are the industry leading YKK with a soft grip TPU molded zipper pull. All of these have been field tested to last the test of rugged conditions.We have also decided to change the logo to black due to popular demand!We will be getting a mock up of what it will look like soon but in the meantime use your vivid imagination to picture the logo black (shouldn't be too hard). The Straps and AdjustersThe shoulder straps on this pack are as wide as a standard backpack (2"") and have a light padding to provide comfort while still being lightweight. The mesh on the underside of the shoulder straps gives a cool and lightweight feeling, while still keeping their strength from the reinforcements designed in along the sides. The shoulder straps are extra long so every body type can wear the pack comfortably.Shoulder Strap (Left) has a soft mesh on the outside with padding on the inside. Sternum strap (right) can adjust up and down and open wider.Sternum straps should stand the test of time, that's what we believe. The sternum strap is super robust and has a light stretchy section so it is extra comfy. It can be adjusted up, down, and wide to fit every person's body type. The strap dimensions are: 18"" (45cm) length padded section + 24"" (60cm) adjustable nylon strap length, so the total usable strap length is 42"" (107cm).  Water Bladder Compatible
The Uinta Daypack has an integrated water bladder system that is perfect for hiking or those long days to always keep you hydrated. The hose routing makes sense without having to leave a zipper cracked open. There is a seperate compartment just for a hydration bladder that does not open to the main compartment. The hose can be pushed through the hole and around to the shoulder strap for quick access where you need it.Most 2L Hydration packs will fit into the custom designed pocket.
 Perfect Complementary products (Designed to fit together) Perfect Hydration Bladder (2L) This is not your typical hydration bladder. It is packed with our favorite features such as pop-proof TPU material that is seriously tough, the bladder mouth that completely opens to turn it inside out to clean it, and a quick release mechanism for the hose. It is dishwasher safe, leak-proof, and has a pop-up bite valve that lets out just the right amount of fluid when biting. All of the features are super durable and made from the highest quality materials.      Would you do this to your old blue hydration pack? Didn't think so. This one can take the abuse.Washable!Turn it inside out and throw it in the dishwasher! Have you ever made the worst mistake ever and left liquid in your old water bladder or even worse put Gatorade in it? If you are like us, you have, and you will never forget how horrible it was to clean out the bladder. We think time is better spent doing anything else in the world, so you can easily clean this bladder by turning it completely inside out and putting it in the dishwasher! Compression Packing Cubes Compress these indestructible cubes down by 30%. If you've never experienced the joy of traveling with packing cubes, prepare yourself to regret never having them before...This set of three cubes compress down your stuff to carry the lowest possible volume. They are made with a super strong, yet lightweight 410D Nylon Ripstop and YKK zippers. The compression zipper brings the volume down by about 30% to make packing your gear efficient and dense. The cubes open all the way so they can be used right in drawers without having to unpack and repack when you are done. All these features fit into a super small package that weighs next to nothing. This is what the kit includesKit Includes: 2L Compression Cube: Perfect for electronics or small personal items.4L Compression Cube: Just the right size for undies and Tees.10L Compression Cube: This is the big boy that keeps all your pants, shirts, and maybe your travel companion's too! Featured on: When will it all ship?Design ProcessProject inspiration and development:The project was born from a 10 day trip in Europe where I brought both a large duffel and a standard backpack, which didn't make a lot of sense to me. I wore the duffel on my back and the backpack on my front, which made me feel like a Bull in a china shop wherever I went. I could have fit all my gear into my large duffel except that my daypack didn't fit well, so I was forced to carry it outside like a dope. The problem distracted from the amazing places we visited. When I got back I looked at the available options only to find packs that were too simple, too small, or too expensive. The gears in my head started turning and I started researching to find and solve the problems found in packable daypacks available on the market.Here I am in Zurich thinking about an easier way to do things:Walking around like this even for a little while is frustrating and makes you vulnerable to pickpocketers.
 Customers were surveyed, the pack was scrutinized, field tested, iterated on, and finally we captured the design with only the best features.  The included features hone in on the most important uses of a day pack, and cut out the rest. The minimal design is very functional, yet does not add unnecessary complexity that can clutter the use and ad failure points. Early survey data, Sketches, and first prototype iterations. Refunds/Returns?      We only use premium materials and offer a one year warranty.

<h3>About Snowflake</h3>
<p>We created Snowflake last winter after realizing there wasn't an easy way for like-minded people to connect and go on outdoor adventures - yes, you could go on Tinder, Bumble or one of the other several social apps out there, but they're not the most ideal apps for finding someone to go skiing or hiking with. In a given year,<strong> 30% of skiers and riders</strong> won't go shredding because they simply ""don't have anyone to go with."" Here at Snowflake, we're all <i>very passionate</i> about skiing, riding, hiking and other outdoorsy sports - <strong>there's truly nothing more fulfilling than being in the mountains, especially with friends! </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475269521/j2t6ellbjxr5cy4pi1u6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Sometimes a friend isn't up for going riding one Saturday though or perhaps you want to go on an impromptu trip to Park City, Utah one weekend and want to <strong>find someone to ski or ride with</strong>. Snowflake is the community we've all been longing for - a <strong>community of adventurers </strong>that want to spend time outdoors or simply grab a drink after a long day of shredding! We're currently just allowing users to choose <strong>skiing and snowboarding</strong> for sports they're interested in, but we will be <strong>adding hiking, mountain biking, </strong>and<strong> other outdoor sports this spring! </strong></p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Snowflake is<strong> integrated with Facebook</strong> so it's super easy to create a profile, upload a few photos, answer a few questions about your ability level and mountains preferences and input your home mountain.</p>

<h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP </h3>
<p>With winter just around the corner, it's the perfect time to get involved with Snowflake especially with all of the new changes occurring! One of Snowflake's co-founders, Catherine developed a passion for programming while running Snowflake last winter in Breckenridge, CO. This past summer, she attended a 3-month <strong>web development course</strong> at <strong>DevMountain</strong>, a top coding boot camp in the country. She learned a significant amount about coding but does not have the expertise to build the<strong> Android version </strong>completely by herself without a senior developer. She is contributing to the code but we have hired a more experience Android developer - <strong>app development is not cheap</strong> and we will also be revamping the iOS app as well with those new features.</p>
<p>We will use any remaining funds on marketing Snowflake to expand our markets and create a <strong>community of thousands of people</strong> around the US, Canada, and parts of Europe! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are several components that go into app development - it's no easy feat, but with Catherine's recent education and experience creating a few website apps, we're confident that iOS and Android app development will go smoothly. </p>
<p><strong>Lastly, we want to thank all of our Kickstarter supporters from last year (it didn't reach it's goal), our investors, and everyone that downloaded and used Snowflake in its infancy. We're super psyched to revamp Snowflake, to create a larger world-wide community of outdoor adventurers, to butter on powder with fellow Snowflakers, and have an incredible ski season - we hope that you will help us achieve this!</strong></p>

-Nick @ Trainer Tips reviews GO Backpack first 5 minutes

 

-Dronpes @ The Silph Road
 

 
The GO Backpack is a smart and flexible backpack designed around the everyday workflow of Pokémon trainers. From exercising at the gym, to running for classes, to meeting with coworkers or sprinting for that Tyranitar, it is the one backpack for all the situations.
 
 
 

I'm 5'8""
 


Four key features for Pokémon* trainers –
1. Organizer pockets for multiple batteries. Inside the back panel. It is the best spot for weight distribution.

2. Insulation pockets on both sides. Bring your own bottle to avoid paying extra for hydration. And keep your water bottles cool. 

3. The perfect exit spots for charging cable. Two exit points for left handed play and right handed play.


4. Secret wallet pocket located on your lower back. Sprint or walk, you can feel confident that your wallet is safe and secure.

 

It’s more than a backpack for Pokémon Go*, it’s your everyday carry workhorse. Every feature had been meticulously evaluated and engineered to give you maximum value for your money. In Pokemon Go* speak, the IV of this pack is off the charts high! 
For Work

For School

For Gym - There's walking, and then there's working out 
 
For Vacation - Nom.Nom.Nom your way to the next adventure 
 
For Baby - Too... Much... Diapers...

<h3>Adventure is everywhere! </h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Monica Ortega and I am the creator and host of Monica Goes. I want to show people that you don't have to be an adrenaline junkie, an expert, or a rich world-traveler to take an adventure and change your life. From national parks, to big cities, to going off the beaten path, adventure truly is everywhere. </p>
<p>I have been a professional host, actress, singer, line dancer, and occasional bull-rider for the past 13 years and trying new things and pushing out of my comfort zone made me want to encourage other people to do the same. I don't want to just SHOW you the different adventures that I'm on, I want to take you along, give you the information you need to go, and inspire you to take the leap and do it yourself!</p>
<p>In the past two years I've created over 35 episodes, written 90 blogs, started an #adventurechat on Twitter, built up a following of over 35,000 people, and created relationships with many different companies. It's right at that next step! I'm in the process of securing sponsorships and pitching the sizzle reel to networks but I need your help. I research, shoot, host, edit, and promote the show entirely on my own and have done it all out of pocket for the last two years. With one more year of funding, I can get the show to a place where it is either on a network educating people on tv, or a self-sustaining webseries that continues to grow and inspire. </p>
</div><div>
<p>I am looking to raise $30,000 to fund Monica Goes and get it to a place where it is making enough money on its own. This money will go toward travel costs and camera equipment as well as networking events and conferences. I am always learning and trying to improve. Last year I attended a 3-day entrepreneur workshop, the Women in Travel Summit, the LA Travel and Adventure Show and became a member of the Superstar blogging e-course. Also, because I create the entire show on my own, the funding would go towards having an assistant to help me shoot the episodes and work with potential sponsors. </p>
<p>In 2017 I have already traveled to Pismo Beach and Kings Canyon National Park. I have trips planned to Iceland and Colorado and am hoping to add Alaska, Michigan, the Grand Canyon, Arizona, and Portland to the list. This money will help make these episodes a reality.</p>
<p>I also feel very strongly about giving back! I want this to be a show for everyone and I love our National Parks and want to encourage people to explore them for years to come. So for every donation the show receives I will donate $1 to the National Park Service. </p>
<p>Here are some more perks to donating!</p>
<ul>
<li>$25 donations receive a Monica Goes pen and personalized thank you message</li>
<li>$50 donations will receive a pen and Monica Goes sticky pad as well as a thank you</li>
<li>$100 donations will get an adventure bumper sticker, the pen, sticky pad, and a thank you!</li>
<li>$1000 donations will receive everything above as well as a producer credit</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>Every little bit helps! If the goal is not reached, I plan to take whatever is raised and put it toward advancing this show. I believe wholeheartedly in creating something inspiring and will continue to do that in whatever way I can. Even if you cannot contribute you can still be a part of this goal by sharing this campaign with others through email, social media, and even word of mouth. Chances are you know someone who loves the outdoors and travel and might be looking for something exactly like this. Thank you in advance for all of your help and encouragement! </p>

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Bart, I'm 27 and I'm becoming a father in July. I was born in Poland, although in my opinion, the whole Earth is our homeland, if we're wise enough to cooperate with it.<br/>I've always loved traveling. Whether it be by plane, train, or automobile. However most of my trips were wild, extreme and really dangerous. In my life, I found myself in more than a few difficult situations.</p>
<p>I've never felt that I'm 100% prepared with standard survival kits to face out difficulties during my adventures.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489162937/blgslqkonwfvfjqv2lc7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>STRAPZ came out of need to feel <strong>safe</strong> and be <strong>prepared</strong>, whether it is a short tour or a long, exhausting expedition.<br/>I wanted to create timeless and <strong>extra durable</strong> piece to fulfil your survival needs, an accessory that you can bring with you to the city, on hikes, and on all of your adventures. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Women</strong>, as well as men, can use STRAPZ.</p>

<p>I would like to make sure, that <strong>you</strong> or your <strong>family</strong> will be always <strong>prepared</strong> for difficulties caused by unexpected things.</p>
<p>There is no team of ""experts"" with me, as can you usually notice on other projects.  As my mission and goals are clear, I don't really need a bunch of folks messing around (no offense). I know what I'm doing and I know how to deliver the <strong>best product quality</strong> to customers.</p>

</ul>
<p>This material is <strong>waterproof,</strong> <strong>UV resistant </strong>and<strong> floatable</strong> (melting point <strong>300°F</strong>).</p>
<p>I invented STRAPZ to benefit people in 3 ways: <strong>FIRST AID</strong>, <strong>SURVIVAL</strong> and <strong>OUTDOOR EXERCISES.</strong> </p>
<p>It completes and works with every survival gear. However it's a great survival kit itself!</p>

I was born in Poland, although in my opinion, the whole Earth is our homeland, if we're wise enough to cooperate with it.I've always loved traveling. Whether it be by plane, train, or automobile. However most of my trips were wild, extreme and really dangerous. In my life, I found myself in more than a few difficult situations.
I've never felt that I'm 100% prepared with standard survival kits to face out difficulties during my adventures.

STRAPZ came out of need to feel safe and be prepared, whether it is a short tour or a long, exhausting expedition.I wanted to create timeless and extra durable piece to fulfil your survival needs, an accessory that you can bring with you to the city, on hikes, and on all of your adventures. 
Women, as well as men, can use STRAPZ.


I always wanted to become a paramedic, but I've chosen to study National Defence. My mission is to give you the right tools, to deal with sudden accidents during your trips. I want you to come home safe and sound from your every journey.
I would like to make sure, that you or your family will be always prepared for difficulties caused by unexpected things.
There is no team of ""experts"" with me, as can you usually notice on other projects.  As my mission and goals are clear, I don't really need a bunch of folks messing around (no offense). I know what I'm doing and I know how to deliver the best product quality to customers.
STRAPZ has the strongest stitches on the market!

One of the people, who tested STRAPZ (an ex-army officer) said to me ""It's just a couple of straps and other accesories, but it works perfectly and most importantly - it gives the ability to save lives...pitty you weren't born earlier Bart..""
 “The greatest ideas are the simplest.” William Golding

STRAPZ is made of thick and extremely durable polypropylene webbing, breaking strength of:

RED -  3858lb;1750kg,
BLACK - 2204lb;1050kg
GREEN - 1543lb;700kg

This material is waterproof, UV resistant and floatable (melting point 300°F).
I invented STRAPZ to benefit people in 3 ways: FIRST AID, SURVIVAL and OUTDOOR EXERCISES. 
It completes and works with every survival gear. However it's a great survival kit itself!
STRAPZ is fully invented, designed and manufactured by myself. I put my best effort in the whole process of production. 
 
All components of STRAPZ:

 


Green harness - comfortable (shoulder strap pads included) & fully adjustable, features emergency whistle, fire starter, pill/tinder container, paracord (16ft - 5m) and 3 x carabiner.

Red bands - the most durable straps. You will find them useful to fasten firewood, huge objects such as logs, trees, etc. They work great as arm sling, ankle stabilizer or improvised traction splint.

Black handles - the most durable handles in the world, help you to carry unstable items. Also perfect for outdoor workouts.

Green band/tourniquet - provides an effective mean to stop 'catastrophic haemorrhage' - serious bleeding wounds to the extent that death is imminent due to blood loss. Green band can also be used as a bedroll strap.

Black tow strap - connected to the harness allows you to literally tow heavy objects or injured companions (on improvised stretcher). Black strap works well as sling shot .

Green bottle/can holder - heavy duty & water resistant. Keep your hands free during your outing and have your water or favorite drink at you side (if you find yourself in a difficult situation without any bottle or can, you may always use a plastic bag filled with water).

All weigh just 1.94lb(880g)!

STRAPZ fits into small and waterproof bag, which can be used as a floatation device.

Screw lock carabiners are much safer than normal ones.

Right shoulder strap features an integrated emergency whistle, fire starter and a paracord (16ft - 5m).

My goal is to build a company and create products that give the people confidence on every trip. STRAPZ is just the begining, I have more innovative ideas inside my head.

<h3>Historic Log Cabin Renovation</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>Hi, I am Nancy Page.  I am the owner of Wakaigan Shores LLC.  We are a small, family run resort on Houghton Lake in Michigan.  We have nine log cabins that were built in the early 1950's.  I took ownership of this resort in 2012 and my family and I have been working very hard to restore the quality of this establishment.  We are currently running at 90% occupancy rate during the summer season and have mostly repeat business each year.  Our goal is to be the premium family resort in Michigan and to bring back the wholesome family vacation that was very popular  in the 'good old days'.</p>
<p>Since we took ownership we have been working very hard to renovate the log cabins.  We have been roofing cabins, replacing rotted logs, chinking, and a variety of other tasks that are required by these special structures. "" Morning Mist"" (aka Cabin 4), has some special problems.  Her walls have pulled apart which has led to a sagging roof.  In addition, she needs some foundation work and approximately 15 logs replaced.  Once this is done, she will also need a new roof.  My husband and I try as best we can to make the repairs ourselves, but straightening walls and log replacement is a bit beyond our skill level.  We do have an excellent Michigan craftsman that helps us with these tasks and has provided us with a plan to save this lovely cabin. However, in this case, time is critical as the more winters pass, the more difficult it becomes to save this great cabin.  We want to have this work completed by the summer 2016 season, so the families who stay in ""Morning Mist"" will be able to enjoy our efforts.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise $4000, which should be sufficient to repair the logs and walls.  It should also cover the chinking material (we do this work ourselves).  Any additional funds will go to cover roofing material and to help repair our other eight log cabins.  We have replaced roofs on two cabins and have completed log repair on four cabins, but there is still a lot of work to do.  Log cabins are a labor of love!</p>
<p>We appreciate all donations, regardless of size.  We have offered ""perks"" for larger donations, but every dollar is meaningful.  And whether you can donate or not, you can help our cause by sharing our campaign in email and on facebook, so please tell your friends.  </p>
<p>Thank you so much from me and my family at Wakaigan Shores Resort!</p>

Have
you ever worked alone till late at night, feeling tired, sleepy and lonely?
Are
you always obsessed in computer without even having a rest?
Do
you think there's not enough realistic interaction but too much in virtual?
Don't
worry, here comes the MOMO!
MOMO is your desktop friend designed to
accompany you and remind you in order to solve the above problems you may have
encountered.



Why MOMO?
Though sitting for a long time is a universally-known unhealthy habit, we usually find it hard to stop working with the computer without a reminder.
There are existing apps and alarms indeed, however, they are always easy to shut down and don't have interaction with humans . A cute and friendly reminder from reality gives you love and care. That’s why we design MOMO.
Get your own MOMO to have a healthier and efficient
work style!


What have MoMo Achieved Now ?

Basic Functions



MOMO is a cute desktop reminder robot that can
help you build up healthy and orderly working habit. It has an ultrasonic module and
a human infrared sensor module to receive information from the environment and it
will properly remind the user based on the information. 






If you have been sticking to the PC for 52
minutes, it will nod his head and remind you to take a break for about 17
minutes, as the 52-17 pattern is considered to be the healthiest and the most efficient
way of working.







If you ignore his behavior and go on working, it will get irritated, nodding heavier and
quicker for it realizes ""my master didn't listen to me"".




Simple, cute and friendly, MOMO is the tiny hero standing on your table, always taking care of your health and
accompanying you.







The Features!

Robot toy(easy,safe,fun)




We are inspired by wooden
puzzle. The structure is not only solid and artistic but also make
assembly process full of fun. You will get a sense of accomplishment by making up a MOMO on your own!


Personalized shell(color,shape)  


you can DIY to change the face,
the color or even the shape of your MOMO freely! It's a simple but pleasant
work with numbers of choices far beyond your imagination! We also provide various shells for
you to make up your MOMO!


What more can MOMO Achieve with Your Support?

in both Kernel and Shell, we extremely need your support to help us carry on
our process to develop it. Your contribution will help to improve MOMO a lot in terms of the following aspects:

Kernel
1. Using better sensors to get more accurate data

2. Make it completely encapsulated so that it can change the shells freely or just make the electrical components easy enough to be assembled by anybody.

3. Build an app to make its function more diversified and
privatized. 
4. Build up MOMO’s datacloud technology module to record your working habit and provide
personalized suggestions

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Todd.  I am 51 years old and I love to travel.  I work in the transportation, logistics, and process management field so I travel 40-50 trips per year.  I am married to the most incredible woman I have ever known.  </p>
<p>The Tabuum idea came to me when I was flying to California and had to move my tablet so the flight attendant could place the food on my tray table.  When i arrived in California I went to a local store and purchased two bathroom shower suction cups and a snake light.  With the help of a friend I put together a very basic concept of a Tabuum just to see if it would actually work and hold my tablet and stick to the tray table.  And wow did it work!  Over the past 4 months and with a lot of help I have produced a working and highly functional prototype and I have used it during 8 recent flights.  Several flight attendants have remarked ""what is that?"" ""where did you buy it?"" and ""wow, that is the coolest thing I have seen on a plane"".  Those comments, along with several others, got me really excited and thinking that I am on to something special.</p>
<p>I have come up with ideas in the past and have never had the resources to take them to market.  I wanted something beautiful, highly functional, and not made from plastic that will break over time.  This time I decided that this product is just too useful to let it fall by the wayside.  Please help us take this great idea to market and allow us to develop other innovative ideas.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will use the money we receive to purchase materials, pay for a company to machine the aluminum and anodize the parts.  We also need to design and buy the custom rubber suction cups.  We need do things like, register for a patent, register a trademark, build a website, and develop packaging and user manuals.  Unfortunately, we will also need to pay for liability insurance and for attorney's to help us with all of the legal stuff.</p>
<p>I am new to this entire process and will require professional assistance throughout the process. But with your help I know we can make the Tabuum a success.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In my industry I am a fixer and a problem solver.  I work relentlessly to overcome complex business and technical problems on a daily basis.  I have spent the last several months overcoming design challenges and other significant issues to simply make the Tabuum prototype a reality.  I have had to learn how to 3D Print parts, learn CAD software, and sleep on a friends couch in the US for weeks on end just to bring the idea to life.</p>
<p>Some of the risks are that we cannot get the Tabuum produced in a cost effective manner due to the rising cost of aluminum and the cost of the CNC machining work that is required.  I am doing everything possible to have the Tabuum manufactured in the US by a small CNC machine shop because I believe in supporting small businesses.  Building a solid relationship with a small hungry CNC machine shop in the US where I can watch over the machining process personally and make changes on the fly are crucial to the success of the Tabuum.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Believe me I understand that life is always challenging and giving money to a project is not always possible even if you believe in the concept.  If you can't contribute financially you can help us by spreading the word, linking to our project via social media, and or sharing your thoughts with us about the design, process, packaging, etc.  Or if you are an attorney who would be willing to assist us at a discounted rate, an engineer, web designer, (I am not any of those) who would be willing to help us, please reach out to me.</p>

</div></div>","Who am I?
My name is Todd.  I am 51 years old and I love to travel.  I work in the transportation, logistics, and process management field so I travel 40-50 trips per year.  I am married to the most incredible woman I have ever known.  
The Tabuum idea came to me when I was flying to California and had to move my tablet so the flight attendant could place the food on my tray table.  When i arrived in California I went to a local store and purchased two bathroom shower suction cups and a snake light.  With the help of a friend I put together a very basic concept of a Tabuum just to see if it would actually work and hold my tablet and stick to the tray table.  And wow did it work!  Over the past 4 months and with a lot of help I have produced a working and highly functional prototype and I have used it during 8 recent flights.  Several flight attendants have remarked ""what is that?"" ""where did you buy it?"" and ""wow, that is the coolest thing I have seen on a plane"".  Those comments, along with several others, got me really excited and thinking that I am on to something special.
I have come up with ideas in the past and have never had the resources to take them to market.  I wanted something beautiful, highly functional, and not made from plastic that will break over time.  This time I decided that this product is just too useful to let it fall by the wayside.  Please help us take this great idea to market and allow us to develop other innovative ideas.  
 

What We Need & What You Get
We will use the money we receive to purchase materials, pay for a company to machine the aluminum and anodize the parts.  We also need to design and buy the custom rubber suction cups.  We need do things like, register for a patent, register a trademark, build a website, and develop packaging and user manuals.  Unfortunately, we will also need to pay for liability insurance and for attorney's to help us with all of the legal stuff.
I am new to this entire process and will require professional assistance throughout the process. But with your help I know we can make the Tabuum a success.  

Any pledge amount $5.00 to $24.99 the person will be entered into a drawing to receive a free Tabuum when it becomes available!
Any pledge amount $25.00 to $49.99 the person will receive 20% off the retail price of the Tabuum when it becomes available.
For every $50.00 pledge you will receive a $25.00 gift card to Restaurants.com where you can choose what restaurant you would like to go to.  You will also receive 20% off the retail price of the Tabuum when it becomes available.
If you pledge $100.00 you will receive a free Tabuum when it is available.  The projected retail price will be in the range of $119.99 - $149.99 depending on surface finish and cost of the aluminum at time of manufacture plus applicable tax.  The purchaser will be responsible for all shipping charges and duties plus applicable taxes/VAT if any.  *one per pledge.

So he can pay for immediate medication for his son’s progressive blindness due to sort of genetic disease. I feel so “guilty” that I can not return him on time, such delay results in his son's eyes in danger…I often suffer insomnia for such sense lately.If we can raise more than 10,000, we will:--Pay off the money we borrowed, at least stop paying interest as soon as possible.--Gradually pay to the manufacturer to finish the rest 70% of the contract, so we can keep good relationship with them. And this product can be shared by more families in the world.To show our appreciation to all backers, we offer an Indiegogo-only huge discount based on the MSRP US$250; also we will provide free accessories.If we don't reach our entire goal, we will Still ship Arch Arks to backers so they can --significantly save money as Arch Ark is multifunctional--have a trial to make their summer happier--give us feedback to improve our product further--use their word of mouth or networking to share their experience with all people in the world, so all families can save money and enjoy this amazing product!If the fund reaches more than our goal, especially the reflective quantity more than 3200, we can make more in 1 to 2 months then deliver to backers.Risks & ChallengesBasically, there is NO RISK for this project, because the campaign goal is 10,000, the reflective quantity is  no more than 100, but we have 3200 (1728 in California, US and Vancouver, Canada; 1500 in Shanghai, China) Arch Arks ready to go.If the fund raised reflects a quantity more than 3200 products,--We can start delivery from China in 1 to 1.5 months, from North America in 1.5 to 2 months. That is because we only need to buy PVC materials, which will take 3 to 4 weeks to be made. Factory can make 200-300 Arch Arks a day, 300 units can fill a 20-foot container, if shipped from China to US west coast, 2 to 3 weeks is enough.FAQs--About ProductCan we use Arch Ark on surface with sands, such as beach? Or we can use it on even more coarse surface?Though Arch Ark is made of 12 gauge / 0.30 mm (standard thickness for swimming pool in the market) PVC material, as it has no reinforcement cloth inside, like materials used to make professional marine-class inflatable boat, it is still possible to be cut/broken by sharp articles.For users plan to use on coarse surface, we suggest to use a mat ( we also make very good garage floor mat, topped  No. 1 seller in Amazon Canada), put Arch Ark on the mat, you are much more carefree for piercing on Arch Ark.Certainly, a little silver sand on surface of Arch Ark is definitely OK.--About ShippingHow is your shipping arrangement, is it possible to ship worldwide?We have established accounts with UPS, Fedex and Purolator covering US, Canada and the whole world. We get mini. 35% discount from above courier services, this discount has been reflected on the shipping costs we charge backers.For shipping from China to other continents, we use DHL, we ever shipped Arch Ark order from China to London, UK.Other Ways You Can Help

<li>We believe that if more people with disabilities knew about accessible places to go, they would explore more and experience new things</li>
<li>We have confidence that the community surrounding those with disabilities will adopt our service and help make our tool valuable for those with accessibility needs (they'll submit reviews so that others will know which locations are accessible).</li>

<p>Accessibility information is <strong>extremely limited</strong> and oftentimes <strong>inaccurate</strong>. When someone with a disability wants to go out to eat, visit a coffee shop, or enjoy a drink at a bar, it's difficult for them to know which establishments can serve them. We are campaigning to support the development of AbiliTrek so that we can provide a vast amount of accessibility information to people with disabilities.

</div><div>
<h3>Campaign Breakdown</h3>
<p>It takes plenty of time and really talented people to make a great working product, so with your support we'll be able to achieve the following milestones:</p>
<p><strong>Development of current product, AbiliTrek.com</strong> - $10,000. In our early stages, our website application will allow our users to review how accessible places are and also see other's accessibility reviews on our web platform.</p>
<p><strong>Website Enhancements</strong> - $10,000. Reaching the $20,000 milestone in funding will allow us to improve our web platform of AbiliTrek to make it even more useful for our users. This will include features not yet implemented into our initial website and features requested from Beta testers.</p>
<p><strong>Pilot City Launches and Conferences</strong> - $15,000. It is crucial for our users to find AbiliTrek useful, and without reviews it may not be. Meeting the $35,000 milestone would allow AbiliTrek to launch in 3 pilot cities; Seattle, WA, Washington D.C., and New York City. Initially serving these cities with high disability populations will allow users to quickly generate large amounts of accessibility reviews, making those cities more accessible using AbiliTrek. Additionally, attending disability related conferences will allow leaders in the disability community to adopt our service so that AbiliTrek can be brought back and used all over the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Development of iOS Application</strong> - $30,000. Reaching our FINAL fundraising milestone of $65,000, we can serve our community of iOS users with disabilities. iOS devices are generally more accessible, and that is why we will first develop AbiliTrek for iOS users. We want our iOS users to be able to easily use AbiliTrek on the go, so that they can more easily navigate their everyday lives. With your very generously donated $30,000 we can make that possible.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many people don't know how inaccessible our world is or how many people are dependent on accessible accommodations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>There are over 50 million people with disabilities in the United States.</i> The majority of you likely know someone who has a physical disability, whether it's a friend, family member, or coworker.</li>
<li>It is extremely difficult for people with disabilities to find places they can get into, bathrooms they can use, or even tables they can sit at.</li>
<li>Your contribution to our campaign directly impacts the lives of those with disabilities. Every dollar donated helps make it possible for AbiliTrek to get into the hands of those with disabilities, making it easier for them to plan their days and live their lives.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><i>Risk - </i>Success in completing our mission requires a large community of people to be involved. Gathering accessibility reviews and information is necessary for the AbiliTrek tool to be useful.</p>
<p><i>Opportunity -</i> Advertising on multiple platforms in multiple ways will, both internally and outsourced, will yield a high number of involved community members, and therefor a high number of accessibility reviews.</p>
<p><i>Risk</i> - The accessibility reviews provided by our users bring to light the fact that many places are not accessible.</p>
<p><i>Opportunity -</i> This is an opportunity to for us to encourage our users to be honest in their reviews in order to bring awareness of accessibility to public businesses and locations.</p>
<p><i>Strength -</i> Multiple members of our team have first hand knowledge of accessibility and disability. This allows our team to successfully serve our target users because they have experienced the problem we are solving.</p>

Additionally, attending disability related conferences will allow leaders in the disability community to adopt our service so that AbiliTrek can be brought back and used all over the United States.
Development of iOS Application - $30,000. Reaching our FINAL fundraising milestone of $65,000, we can serve our community of iOS users with disabilities. iOS devices are generally more accessible, and that is why we will first develop AbiliTrek for iOS users. We want our iOS users to be able to easily use AbiliTrek on the go, so that they can more easily navigate their everyday lives. With your very generously donated $30,000 we can make that possible.

The Impact
Many people don't know how inaccessible our world is or how many people are dependent on accessible accommodations.


There are over 50 million people with disabilities in the United States. The majority of you likely know someone who has a physical disability, whether it's a friend, family member, or coworker.
It is extremely difficult for people with disabilities to find places they can get into, bathrooms they can use, or even tables they can sit at.
Your contribution to our campaign directly impacts the lives of those with disabilities. Every dollar donated helps make it possible for AbiliTrek to get into the hands of those with disabilities, making it easier for them to plan their days and live their lives.


 
Risks & Challenges
Risk - Success in completing our mission requires a large community of people to be involved. Gathering accessibility reviews and information is necessary for the AbiliTrek tool to be useful.
Opportunity - Advertising on multiple platforms in multiple ways will, both internally and outsourced, will yield a high number of involved community members, and therefor a high number of accessibility reviews.
Risk - The accessibility reviews provided by our users bring to light the fact that many places are not accessible.
Opportunity - This is an opportunity to for us to encourage our users to be honest in their reviews in order to bring awareness of accessibility to public businesses and locations.
Strength - Multiple members of our team have first hand knowledge of accessibility and disability. This allows our team to successfully serve our target users because they have experienced the problem we are solving.

<p>Anyway, back in 2014 she embarked for a jolly summer trip through Portugal with friends, as she had done several times before.

 Hi, I’m Parker.I like to make things. I make pens, knives, treehouses, drones and, now, anything else my kids want to make. But the biggest thing I’ve made is an airplane.Yeah, the kind you get in and fly. I flew it all over our beautiful country - Death Valley, Maine, Florida, through the Bahamas and other places where the “airport” is really just a patch of crushed coral or a clearing carved out of the forest. These are places where there aren’t mechanics to work on airplanes, so taking tools along is a pretty good idea.Airplanes can only lift a certain amount of weight and there isn’t much space, so you have to think carefully about what to take and how to pack it. Getting smacked in the face by a floating wrench really hurts.That’s when I fell in love with tool rolls. Tool rolls can be small, barely larger than the tools themselves, the individual pockets keep everything organized and, since they’re made out of fabric, they don’t weigh much. It’s easy to see if you’re leaving a wrench buried in the grass. Mine didn’t have to be nice, so I usually made them myself.  So I launched the first version of Tashtego - the tool roll for your toiletries - on Kickstarter with huge success. 1,400 backers raised over $57,000 to make it a reality! I manufactured the products and shipped them around the world. People liked the product, but 1400 backers had lots of ideas for improvement.   So I hired a professional design firm and, together 15 of our most diehard fans,  we improved all the things we loved and added new features to solve the problems of the 1.0. Now, we’re ready to get the new, improved Tashtego to you and reinvent toiletry travel bags forever.

The change demands the power kit which is the Nepal’s Light 3.0 that will have almost everything to save life that too in a portable format. This portable version will track you in case of any emergencies as well as provide you shelter no matter where you are.</p><p>Imagine a situation where you are locked inside your car because of the battery running out of charge. What will you do? Nepal’s Light 3.0 will save you from those circumstances which are unpredictable. </p><div>
<p>With the immense support, motivation and love from you all in the past, Nepal's Light was born. After successful landing of the project in 2016, Nepal's Light 2.0 was made with all of yours involvement. The Nepal's Light 1.0 and Nepal's Light 2.0 became the reason to smile for most of the earthquake victim in different remote places of Nepal.</p>
<p>As you all know that Nepal's Light 1.0 and Nepal's Light 2.0 altogether made 1000 different families and may be more than 1500 individuals started smiling even in the night because of the light that we spread with Nepal's Light. I am unable to find a beautiful word to say that I really appreciate all of yours support. Each and everyone of you are equally kind hearten and are engaged in this project. Having your backup gave me the strength to realize that world has bunch of generous individuals to make this planet a beautiful and cozy place. </p>
<p>How will you react if I say that I have decided to work for yet another version of Nepal's Light? Will you be surprised? How about I say the new version 3.0? YES!! Nepal's Light 3.0. You might be curious on what's with the next version?  For that you can have a look at this:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564021127/vkaa3iw8det52gygvi8g.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>I have started to give new shape to Nepal's Light by making it capable of providing power to almost anything in emergency scenarios. In the past, it was able to charge few mobile phones and provide lights. Now, with some research on how to make more powerful energy, I am all set to make Nepal's Light 3.0, which will charge not only phones but will be a power energy backup even for laptops, that too in the same portable size. Alongside, the 3.0 will also have an emergency kit. The kit will include everything that is needed to save life during emergency, from safety aid to urgent network to powering up devices.</p>
<p>The version 3.0 will have its own mobile application and the app opens up when one uncovers the Nepal's Light 3.0 kit and will start using the network provided by the 3.0. The app will then automatically send the information of that user to our server. We will then be able to know who is at risk and where. While we prepare to reach out to that user, the user will be using the 3.0 kit to protect them and still get connected to us. </p>
<p>I have realized this concept of next version having heard of so many natural disasters as well as man-made emergency scenarios where so many lives were lost that could have been saved if a bit more catious system were created then. But it is never late to do good job and together we all can!</p>
<p>To make this happen, I need support from all of you and your reviews so that the concept becomes more strong as well as reliable. After hearing from you, I will again post update on how the 3.0 is actually going to look and what are the stuffs that the Nepal's Light 3.0 kit will have.</p>

<p>On April 25th, 2015, a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal, killing 8,000 people and injuring 21,000. The earthquake also triggered an avalanche on Mt. Everest, killing 21 - the deadliest day in Everest’s history. In addition to the death and destruction caused by the quake, hundreds of thousands of people were were left homeless and lost access to basic needs like water, electricity, and communication services.</p>

<p>This is a tranquil place with caring people of modest means; we didn’t deserve this. People tried to console me, but their words did not ease my anguish. However, I am not going to dwell about the pain this tragedy inflicted on me, my family and my community.

<h3>My Objective</h3>
<p>My goal in this project is to inform people about the impact of this tragedy on the people of Nepal and to introduce an invention I designed to address one particular consequence of the disaster, i.e., that people have been left without an adequate source of electricity to power their homes as well as to recharge their mobile phones and other electronic devices.</p>

<h1>Part I: My Upbringing</h1>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580913529/szfksvtubxpxvvnqgp9r.jpg"" src=""""/></p></div>
<p>I am originally from Bouddha, Kathmandu and  have always been fascinated by electronics and how things work. As a teenager I was inspired by engineers and people who were adept at building and fixing stuff. Engineering, particularly hardware and electrical engineering, captivated me. This led me to apply to Khwopa Engineering College in Bhaktapur, Nepal, where I studied electrical engineering, and began my journey into the engineering universe.</p>
<blockquote><p>In college, I really began to understand what I was meant to do: build things.</p></blockquote>
<p>I transformed from a kid with lots of wacky ideas to a professional engineer with a mental framework for problem solving. Once the earthquake hit, I was immediately able to put my engineering training and passion to work.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Part II: The Inception of the Idea</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The desperation I felt when the earthquake hit compelled me to conceive of some way to help these people - my neighbors - and my engineering background inspired me to devise a temporary, portable power source.</p>
<blockquote><p>It dawned on me that a solar powered mobile phone charger that could also power some other devices and which also had a flashlight was an ideal, economical solution.</p></blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465498729/150427103509-13-nepal-quake-0427-super-169_mlrcm5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>However, I soon found out that a similar device was already available on the Chinese market, but the shipping costs makes them prohibitively expensive. There were also similar devices in Nepal but they were also not affordable for most people. This is when I began to think about making an affordable portable solar powered charger for my Nepali community.<p> </p>
<h1>Part III: The Prototype</h1>
<p>I drove to my Engineering Lab in Kathmandu, and I got to work on building a prototype. I scrapped together a spare solar panel, some electrical cables, solder, a soldering iron, and a variety of spare electrical parts, and spit out a prototype. Here it is:</p>

<p>A stroke of serendipity hit when manufacturers with whom I developed relationships when I was in college participating in tech hackathons became interested in partnering with me to build the product.</p>
<p>I showed the prototype to Sir. Bal K Joshi of <a href=""http://thamel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thamel.com</a> and he promised me he would help me manufacture the product so that it reaches to the needy. He introduced me to Ghampower, a solar company in Nepal.</p>
<p>I got to know about Bal Sir from Idea Studio Nepal. Idea studio is the platform that turns business ideas into reality by providing networks, funds and business strategies. I am fortunate that I was selected from my idea to initiate a robotics lab in Nepal couple of years ago. Because of Idea studio that I was able to talk with Joshi Sir and his network. Idea studio provided me with all necessary networks that I needed to explore. Idea studio is currently executing its 2nd session to find out sustainable business ideas. Thanks to idea studio for opening up opportunity.</p>
<blockquote><p>With funds from Joshi Sir and with help from Ghampower, I was able to develop 500 such lights in just couple of weeks. The lights were sent to different rural districts of Nepal. Some of those lights were sent to Gorkha, the epicenter of the first earthquake where most houses were destroyed and there were thousands of casualties.</p></blockquote>
<p>In persuading the manufacturers to back me, it didn’t hurt that I had already sold 100 of the devices, and I had an impressive order book for many hundreds more.</p>
<p>We quickly ramped up and went into mass production, and with experience, we figured out how to make an even less expensive and higher quality product. The device now costs only $20 per unit - 3x less than competing devices in Nepal - and it not only operates as a mobile recharger but it also has and two lights attached to illuminate the device. The unit also includes a rechargeable torch-light which operates as a super flashlight.</p>
<p>When I first conceived of the idea, I was only thinking of designing a relatively cheap product to solve a desperate problem. However, working with the manufacturers forced me to focus on building a very high quality, reliable product, not just a cheap one. Now, allow me to give you a more detailed look at Nepal’s Light.</p>
<p>The conditions I encountered trying to build the light were less than ideal. Just imagine a situation where you have to walk 5 Kilometers just to get a single LED light or a solar panel. I still remember that while I was was working on the final design at the factory an aftershock hit and we were terrified! In spite of this, I continued to work and finally completed the prototype and began manufacturing the product.</p>
<p>I need help in making this light a real product for the world.</p>
<p>I want to reach each and every village where there is no light and people still have no way to charge their mobile phones. To do this, I need funding in order to make a better product so that product works fine for longer time. I also need funding because we need to manufacture in high speed so that people in need get access to this light sooner.</p>
<p>As noted, we were able to manufacture 500 Nepal’s Lights. We are now working on an improved version of the product on Collaborizm, as well as crowdfunding $10,000 on IndieGoGo to add new features to the device and to scale production to 5,000 more units.</p>

</div></div>","The Nepal's Light 3.0My aim is to produce portable power bank for Tesla Electric Vehicles.The Nepal's Light 3.0 technical testing phase:  Why Nepal’s Light 3.0? The answer is very simple: To save life in any sort of emergencies. The Nepal’s Light is coming back with so many added features and by making itself a life savior. The previous version was only able to charge mobile phones and provide light but imagine! what if a portable kit is powerful enough to charge almost any electronic device that too in emergency? What if the next version will power your electric car? Wouldn’t that be amazing? Yes, The Nepal’s Light 3.0 will be a complete package that can charge a laptop, a phone to a car. Along with that, the kit will also have a first aid kit included, drinking water, some food & a tent that becomes essential to save life during disaster. We have seen many people around the world getting stuck to a place for days during disaster. To avoid the damage done to people’s lives by those situations The Nepal’s Light 3.0 is mandatory. There were first aid kits in the past but with the change in time we have digitized ourselves. The change demands the power kit which is the Nepal’s Light 3.0 that will have almost everything to save life that too in a portable format. This portable version will track you in case of any emergencies as well as provide you shelter no matter where you are.Imagine a situation where you are locked inside your car because of the battery running out of charge. What will you do? Nepal’s Light 3.0 will save you from those circumstances which are unpredictable. 
With the immense support, motivation and love from you all in the past, Nepal's Light was born. After successful landing of the project in 2016, Nepal's Light 2.0 was made with all of yours involvement. The Nepal's Light 1.0 and Nepal's Light 2.0 became the reason to smile for most of the earthquake victim in different remote places of Nepal.
As you all know that Nepal's Light 1.0 and Nepal's Light 2.0 altogether made 1000 different families and may be more than 1500 individuals started smiling even in the night because of the light that we spread with Nepal's Light. I am unable to find a beautiful word to say that I really appreciate all of yours support. Each and everyone of you are equally kind hearten and are engaged in this project. Having your backup gave me the strength to realize that world has bunch of generous individuals to make this planet a beautiful and cozy place. 
How will you react if I say that I have decided to work for yet another version of Nepal's Light? Will you be surprised? How about I say the new version 3.0? YES!! Nepal's Light 3.0. You might be curious on what's with the next version?  For that you can have a look at this:
I have started to give new shape to Nepal's Light by making it capable of providing power to almost anything in emergency scenarios. In the past, it was able to charge few mobile phones and provide lights. Now, with some research on how to make more powerful energy, I am all set to make Nepal's Light 3.0, which will charge not only phones but will be a power energy backup even for laptops, that too in the same portable size. Alongside, the 3.0 will also have an emergency kit. The kit will include everything that is needed to save life during emergency, from safety aid to urgent network to powering up devices.
The version 3.0 will have its own mobile application and the app opens up when one uncovers the Nepal's Light 3.0 kit and will start using the network provided by the 3.0. The app will then automatically send the information of that user to our server. We will then be able to know who is at risk and where. While we prepare to reach out to that user, the user will be using the 3.0 kit to protect them and still get connected to us. 
I have realized this concept of next version having heard of so many natural disasters as well as man-made emergency scenarios where so many lives were lost that could have been saved if a bit more catious system were created then. But it is never late to do good job and together we all can!
To make this happen, I need support from all of you and your reviews so that the concept becomes more strong as well as reliable. After hearing from you, I will again post update on how the 3.0 is actually going to look and what are the stuffs that the Nepal's Light 3.0 kit will have.
Help me make this successful by sharing this update to your friend and family as well, so that we together can make a better kit very soon.
 The Nepal's Light 2.0I am thankful to everyone who have helped me raise funds to create and distribute Nepal's Light. After successfully raising the funds I have developed new version of Nepal's Light and soon after few days I will be going to different rural areas and start distributing the Light to people and families in real need. Here is how the new version looks:
  Nepal's Light version 2.0 distribution started from remote village of Nepal from 11th Feb 2017.
Here are few images of distribution:
  
  The Project Story (Since 2015)The Nepal's Light 1.0Short SummaryI am a 25-years old electronics and communication engineer in Nepal, who built a solar-powered charger, named “The Nepal’s Light”, and this invention is currently powering 500 Earthquake victims homes in rural Nepal. I am looking to raise funds to distribute and manufacture this product to rural regions of Nepal, hardest hit by the Earthquake. The Earthquake
On April 25th, 2015, a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal, killing 8,000 people and injuring 21,000. The earthquake also triggered an avalanche on Mt. Everest, killing 21 - the deadliest day in Everest’s history. In addition to the death and destruction caused by the quake, hundreds of thousands of people were were left homeless and lost access to basic needs like water, electricity, and communication services.
It’s hard to describe what it’s like to watch not only your home, but your entire neighborhood get destroyed by nature’s fury.
This is a tranquil place with caring people of modest means; we didn’t deserve this. People tried to console me, but their words did not ease my anguish. However, I am not going to dwell about the pain this tragedy inflicted on me, my family and my community. I am an engineer and I have been trained to solve complex problems, and that is how I decided to focus my energies.
 
 

(Nepali Earthquake Victims holding the Nepal's Light 1.0, honoring those lost in the quake) 
My Objective
My goal in this project is to inform people about the impact of this tragedy on the people of Nepal and to introduce an invention I designed to address one particular consequence of the disaster, i.e., that people have been left without an adequate source of electricity to power their homes as well as to recharge their mobile phones and other electronic devices.
 
 
Part I: My Upbringing

I am originally from Bouddha, Kathmandu and  have always been fascinated by electronics and how things work. As a teenager I was inspired by engineers and people who were adept at building and fixing stuff. Engineering, particularly hardware and electrical engineering, captivated me. This led me to apply to Khwopa Engineering College in Bhaktapur, Nepal, where I studied electrical engineering, and began my journey into the engineering universe.
In college, I really began to understand what I was meant to do: build things.
I transformed from a kid with lots of wacky ideas to a professional engineer with a mental framework for problem solving. Once the earthquake hit, I was immediately able to put my engineering training and passion to work.
 
Part II: The Inception of the Idea
 
The desperation I felt when the earthquake hit compelled me to conceive of some way to help these people - my neighbors - and my engineering background inspired me to devise a temporary, portable power source.
It dawned on me that a solar powered mobile phone charger that could also power some other devices and which also had a flashlight was an ideal, economical solution.
 
However, I soon found out that a similar device was already available on the Chinese market, but the shipping costs makes them prohibitively expensive. There were also similar devices in Nepal but they were also not affordable for most people. This is when I began to think about making an affordable portable solar powered charger for my Nepali community. 
Part III: The Prototype
I drove to my Engineering Lab in Kathmandu, and I got to work on building a prototype. I scrapped together a spare solar panel, some electrical cables, solder, a soldering iron, and a variety of spare electrical parts, and spit out a prototype. Here it is:

 
Part IV: Initial Manufacturing Run
 
A stroke of serendipity hit when manufacturers with whom I developed relationships when I was in college participating in tech hackathons became interested in partnering with me to build the product.
I showed the prototype to Sir. Bal K Joshi of thamel.com and he promised me he would help me manufacture the product so that it reaches to the needy. He introduced me to Ghampower, a solar company in Nepal.
I got to know about Bal Sir from Idea Studio Nepal. Idea studio is the platform that turns business ideas into reality by providing networks, funds and business strategies. I am fortunate that I was selected from my idea to initiate a robotics lab in Nepal couple of years ago. Because of Idea studio that I was able to talk with Joshi Sir and his network. Idea studio provided me with all necessary networks that I needed to explore. Idea studio is currently executing its 2nd session to find out sustainable business ideas. Thanks to idea studio for opening up opportunity.
With funds from Joshi Sir and with help from Ghampower, I was able to develop 500 such lights in just couple of weeks. The lights were sent to different rural districts of Nepal. Some of those lights were sent to Gorkha, the epicenter of the first earthquake where most houses were destroyed and there were thousands of casualties.
In persuading the manufacturers to back me, it didn’t hurt that I had already sold 100 of the devices, and I had an impressive order book for many hundreds more.
We quickly ramped up and went into mass production, and with experience, we figured out how to make an even less expensive and higher quality product. The device now costs only $20 per unit - 3x less than competing devices in Nepal - and it not only operates as a mobile recharger but it also has and two lights attached to illuminate the device. The unit also includes a rechargeable torch-light which operates as a super flashlight.
When I first conceived of the idea, I was only thinking of designing a relatively cheap product to solve a desperate problem. However, working with the manufacturers forced me to focus on building a very high quality, reliable product, not just a cheap one. Now, allow me to give you a more detailed look at Nepal’s Light.

To do this, I need funding in order to make a better product so that product works fine for longer time. I also need funding because we need to manufacture in high speed so that people in need get access to this light sooner.
As noted, we were able to manufacture 500 Nepal’s Lights. We are now working on an improved version of the product on Collaborizm, as well as crowdfunding $10,000 on IndieGoGo to add new features to the device and to scale production to 5,000 more units.
How it Works
Under the hood we are using:
1 Solar Panel
Nepal's Light comes equipped with a model x solar charger. It is is durable and is designed for outdoor use.
 
 12 Hours of Illumination
The light, states here, can power an average home for 12 hours .
 
 12 Hours of Cell Phone Charging
The Light comes with 2 chargers for cell phones, and can charge 5 phones for 1 hour.
 
 Business Venture

While my product addresses a major problem confronting Nepalis and I conceived of it out of my concern for my community, I must acknowledge that my venture is for profit - I am young and I support myself - though I only intend to cover my costs and make a modest return.
We have a viable business model; i.e. we have proven that we have a scaleable business and have secured adequate manufacturing capacity from reputable sources, we have a strong engineering/technical team, and we have reliable distribution channels.

<li>Our product line will be well worth your support, and doesn't stop at this model.  We have BIG PLANS for future Intelligent Cranium Helmets products.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Of course with any project we as developers and engineers encounter Risks &amp; Challenges.  No one wants to see a good idea executed poorly. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Indiegogo and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but a few risks &amp; challenges we expect are:</p> <ul> <li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">MANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There are typical delays regarding molding, technical difficulties during testing that could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with expert tooling manufacturers partners, engineers (internal), software developers (internal) with a track record for prompt quality.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the iC-R gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit and safety of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located and my product commercialization experts will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Availability of components</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Meeting important rider helmet safety standards</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif;"">We will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our Intelligent Cranium Helmets customers.</p>

iC-R Features
Two Heads-up Transparent LCD Displays
These heads-up display lenses provide a projected split view of all real time video streaming from the two rear-view cameras, as well as mobile software related functions such as: Incoming Calls, Navigation, Rider Speed/Rider Telemetry, and much more.
LED Interior Notification Lighting
This interior lighting acts as a notification system and is integrated with an ARS (Assisted Rider Software) and internal sensors. There are two LED colors supporting this system which are Amber & Red. The LED lighting system works in tandem with a warning sound and/or vibration inside the helmet. The soft Amber color means ""Warning""; which will blink in 2 second intervals when a vehicle gets within 420 ft. This feature is also accompanied by a warning sound and/or vibration (optional) inside the helmet. - The Red color means ""Danger""; which will blink in 1 second intervals when a vehicle gets within 240 ft. (Note: These warning distances have been calculated based on speed of travel).  This feature is also accompanied by a warning sound and/or vibration (optional) inside the helmet. Both colors will be visible, but not as to blind or distract the rider while on the road.



Software Center | OTA Software Updates | Open SDK

The software center is the brain of the motorcycle helmet and where all the magic happens.  The PCB (Printed Circuit Board) will come with a very high level of security baked in.  The software center will offer Bluetooth Smart/LE, OTA software updates, Open SDK (for custom mobile application development) capabilities and much more.
Two Rear-view Cameras (210° Field of View)
The Two Rear-View Cameras are strategically placed, and share a total field of view of 210° allowing the rider to see a wider view of what is behind him or her; completely removing the need for the rider to take his or her eyes off the road ahead.
Power Port
This Power Port is built into the rear of the helmet acting as the primary power source, and is in place to allow the helmet and all internal components to be charged and always operational; in the event there is lack of sufficient solar energy throughout the riders day.
Solar Panel
This Solar Panel is built into the top of the helmet acting as the secondary power source; allowing the helmet and all internal components to be charged and always operational while the rider is riding the motorcycle.
High End Interior Speakers
These interior speakers work in tandem with the built in hardware and software to provide sound and audio notifications to the rider as needed.  My team is currently seeking to partner with a big name audio company to achieve the best sound quality for this iC-R system.
User Controlled Tinting Visor
This user controlled tinting visor is projected come standard on all iC-R Helmets and will allow for the fastest response in tinting your visor when you need it.
Bluetooth Smart|LE 

This Bluetooth Smart | LE feature will work in tandem with the iC-R Cloud app allowing any rider with an iC-R Helmet to:


Share their location with other riders


Link with riders nearby and begin two-way communication via voice activation.  The app will provide each rider with an audio & visual prompt to connect.  Both riders must accept in order to connect with each other.

iC-R Cloud Mobile App

The iC-R Cloud mobile app will link and work in tandem with the iC-R Software Center.  This app will boast a number of internal features such as: a Maps section which will provide Navigation, Radar, Riding Conditions, Traffic Patterns, Fuel Stations, & more.



Allow riders sharing their location via Bluetooth LE to see & connect with other riders nearby through text or voice communication.






   The Impact You Can Make By Contributing By sharing our passion to make riding safer for all riders abroad & joining us in this journey to make that happen, you can rest assured that:  You are supporting a Team more than capable of surpassing the tasks at hand. Every cent of all contributions will go directly and solely to the pursuit of bringing this life changing product to market, and in the hands of riders everywhere. The iC-R Dream Team will successfully meet ALL demands during this journey, placed on us by you the contributor/consumer, and those in the near future.
Our product line will be well worth your support, and doesn't stop at this model.  We have BIG PLANS for future Intelligent Cranium Helmets products.    Risks & Challenges  Of course with any project we as developers and engineers encounter Risks & Challenges.  No one wants to see a good idea executed poorly. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Indiegogo and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but a few risks & challenges we expect are:  MANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There are typical delays regarding molding, technical difficulties during testing that could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with expert tooling manufacturers partners, engineers (internal), software developers (internal) with a track record for prompt quality.
PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the iC-R gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit and safety of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.
FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located and my product commercialization experts will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.
Availability of components
Meeting important rider helmet safety standards

We will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our Intelligent Cranium Helmets customers.
ANY pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal. Help us bring this great concept product to life by selecting a Perk option to Back This Project, or by helping us spread the word by sharing our page.

The iC-R Dream Team are firm believers in that ""it's not the size of the storm that comes your way, but how you go through it"".

Maybe you’re one of the 350,000 people in the U.S. every year who have contracted a tick-borne illness and don’t want one again. Or you just don’t want to get sick in the first place.Tick Bands empower people to feel safe outdoors with advanced tick protection. We want you to enjoy being in the woods or your back yard. Your enjoyment shouldn’t suffer because you’re worried about ticks or getting sick.And Tick Bands are incredibly easy to use: just spray, wrap and go!Tick Bands’ secret weapon against ticks is patent-pending Thermoflage technology. When ticks are close by you, they hunt using infrared vision. Thermoflage uses anti-infrared materials developed to make soldiers invisible to night vision goggles – so you look less like a tick’s next meal. Our StoryTick Bands come from the personal experience of founders Dean DeSeve and his dad Gerry. We love being outdoors. We also live in Pennsylvania – the state with the most cases of Lyme Disease, a tick-borne illness.Dean at age 9When Dean was 9 he was bitten by a tick and came down with Lyme. Once he recovered, he didn’t want ticks to keep him from being outside.So Dean picked up a glue gun and made the first Tick Bands using scrap fabric. They worked so well that we made more, to keep our whole family safe.The first Tick Band, made by DeanSince those first Tick Bands, we’ve built and tested nine generations of prototypes. Each one has been an improvement, with better design, stronger construction, and more rugged materials.We researched how ticks hunt their prey and how they see. We’ve spent hours field testing Tick Bands to make sure they’re truly effective. We bought an industrial sewing machine (nicknamed “The Beast”) to make lots of Tick Bands for use in the real world. Praise For Tick BandsWe’ve been thrilled by the positive reactions to Tick Bands by testers and fans. Here are some of the reactions so far:this is AMAZING! - Julie C.I have used Tick Bands for months now and I find them effortless to put on and so comfortable to wear that I forget they’re on. I cannot recommend them enough. - Chris S.Our family spends a ton of time in the woods either hiking or geocaching. Tons of opportunities to get ticks. So far, so good and no ticks! - Joan L.The moment I saw them I thought 2 things:  (1) Genius; and (2) I can’t believe these weren’t invented years ago. Great product. - Mark O.I had to drop you a note telling you how much I have enjoyed the Tick Bands. Living here in the Connecticut Valley and being an avid woodcock hunter I ended up with three embedded ticks at the beginning of hunting season last fall. Sending along a photo of [all of the ticks] I took off of [my dog] Sassy in one two hour hunt. After putting on the bands I didn’t have one problem. The thing that was most significant for me was the peace of mind that it created. Again can’t thank you enough. - Rich CTicks taken off of Rich C's dog Tick Bands Go AnywhereTick Bands are made to go anywhere and do anything you love doing outdoors, like hiking, camping and gardening. Making A Great ProductWe’re obsessed with making sure Tick Bands are a great product. We want your Tick Bands to keep you safe for years. So we're making them in the USA from the most rugged, high-quality materials available. We've gotten a lot of requests to ship Tick Bands as soon as possible. In order to meet this need, we will produce Tick Bands in-house for our first backers using our industrial sewing machine. We've made hundreds of Tick Bands already and we're ready to make more so our early backers can get them quickly.Volume production will be done by MISC Products of Michigan. MISC is a custom manufacturer of complex webbing assemblies such as aircraft harnesses and seat belts. They've been in business for more than 50 years.MISC Products' production facility in Macomb, MichiganMISC's customers include Tesla, GM and the Department of Defense.

<h3>Unique Tree house in cradle of nature</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551347405/vwnbdh4t1xfgyq3nukon.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Most tree houses in Lithuania are only for private use, so we decided to make a tree house available for public. We want that anyone could come in our tree house and spend here some time in calm and nice nature. The tree house is supposed for those, who want to run from stress, from city, from fast life mode and escape to place they dreamed about - nature, nobody around, slow life mode, calm, birds, swinging tree house in the trees and possibility to do nothing. The tree house will be equipped with wood stove heating system, walls, roof and floor heat insulation so you could stay in winter time as well. You even could celebrate Christmas time 2019 or 2020 New Year celebration or 2020 Valentine day in the tree house. </p>
<p>This tree house will be best for alone or couple stay. You can watch birds from early spring to late autumn. The tree house is only few kilometers away from Žuvintas biosphere reserve, where birds are the lords. And there are thousands of them, they live there all the time. So you will be able to listen and to see them. During your stay in the tree house you will be able to go directly to Žuvintas biosphere reserve and stay there for all day and then come back to tree house for night calm rest.  You can find many information about Žuvintas biosphere reserve <a href=""http://www.zuvintas.lt/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. This is official reservation page, so it is in Lithaunian, but of  course, please ask us if you have any need of translation. Property of ""Perk"" pictures belongs to Žuvintas biosphere reserve.</p>
<p>So we want to offer for our contributors and supporters to live in the tree house as first guests and to get this possibility for lower price. Later, we will rent the tree house over booking.com, airbnb.com and other platforms. We have investigated the budget for tree house, we made visualization, which you can see in our video and we made action plan for building the tree house. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551882931/glmgpjzeyhhdxjpybigr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are professional tree house builders with 5 years of experience. In this time we created and tested different types of tree house platform attachments and completed around 20 projects of different tree houses. Our <a href=""https://www.namasmedyje.lt/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>. Time plan for Veribejai tree house is:<br/>- Up to April 15, 2019 to build the platform.  This depends on weather and how fast the spring will come.<br/>- Up to June 1, 2019 to build the tree house. This will depend on the contributions we will get. If we will get full sum we need, then we will finish the tree house in full scale as we planed. <br/>- Up to June 15, 2019 to finish the tree house and invite first guests by that date. As well by that date it will be made camping site and fireplace on the ground next to the tree house. Again, this will very very depend on the contributions we will get. </p>
<p>Contributors will be able to stay in this tree house first ones - 2019 summer and later depends on when you will want to come.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We already chose place, made agreement with landlord, made 3D drawings and have materials for platform. </p>
<p>To build this unique Tree house we need your support of 7000 EUR / 7971 USD for materials and hired labor. Total amount of the project is 7790 EUR / 8870 USD. Around 10% of the sum we will invest our own funds.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551346776/hwafgs28jgcwhao7zrpr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If we will not succeed to gather necessary amount of money, we will built the tree house in smaller scale and with less features. This will be specified later according to the budget we will gather.</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>Most tree houses in Lithuania are private and people can't use opportunity to stay in the tree houses. We will change the game and we will create the opportunity for anyone to stay or even live for longer time in the tree house.  </li>
<li>Tree house is located next to the most important swamp in the Europe - Žuvintas biosphere reserve (It is in UNESCO secured territory list). So we will make possible for people to stay next to that marvel place and to listen, to watch and to feel the birds life.</li>
<li>Of course, people stayed in the calm tree house will improve their mental situation (less stress, rest in the nature). </li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tree house platform is quite big, so we need to hing it on trees with less stress for trees.</li>
<li>Our goal is to do as less as possible intervention and not to damage trees.</li>
<li>The risk is not build tree house up to the time we decided if we will not gather enough budget. So we will have to make it in smaller scale and less features. </li>
</ul>

Of course, people stayed in the calm tree house will improve their mental situation (less stress, rest in the nature). 

Risks & Challenges

Tree house platform is quite big, so we need to hing it on trees with less stress for trees.
Our goal is to do as less as possible intervention and not to damage trees.
The risk is not build tree house up to the time we decided if we will not gather enough budget. So we will have to make it in smaller scale and less features.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a retired Architect/Project Manager that controlled a large region for an Telecommunications company. During my many trips, especially on very early mornings, I found it difficult if not impossible to sleep on planes or trains and envied those who could fall asleep immediately on take-offs. Asking for pillows was futile, as I could not get them in the correct position to aid in my comfort. I always thought there were possibilities, but after searching and finding nothing that offered relief, I went about sketching ideas. After numerous tries, I came up with one design that quickly turned into a home made prototype. This was tested out on my spouse who found it extremely comfortable on an 8 hour drive. Wanting to believe, I tried it out myself on the return trip and found myself asleep on the drive home. The prototype sat in the closet for a few years until recently.</p>
<p>Fast forward to retirement and the Travel Kozy came alive. Now I have taken it to a point where I need to get this out to the mass market so that it can be enjoyed by the million of travelers around the world. I've been in contact with several professional marketers that can assist with this effort, but I need your support to make this happen. I have taken the Travel Kozy from the concept stage to being patented, trademarked and produced, now I need to get it to the mass market through a well planned marketing campaign that will benefit the many travelers given the environment of smaller, thinner and hard seats we are experiencing in today's airplanes.</p>
<p>With your help and backing, the Travel Kozy can be featured in the ""As Seen on TV"" market, Travel magazines, retail and on-line stores and the like. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am seeking a sum of Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000) to embark on this campaign with all funding going towards marketing to the general public and the purchase of additional promotional items shown further along and described below. </p>
<p>Perks being offered include:</p>
<p>A well designed beverage koozie with the company logo</p>
<p>Baseball cap with company logo</p>
<p>Polo shirts with company logo in white, black or charcoal</p>
<p>Canvas shopping bag with company logo</p>
<p>Best of all, the Travel Kozy in 1 or 3 piece design (<strong>ready to ship</strong>)</p>
<p>I am seeking flexible funding with funds going towards the marketing efforts and/or purchase of promotional items (depending on support over and above those already in hand). The remaining funds will be supplemented by personal funds to achieve the marketing funding goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In my video, I shared a story about an elderly lady and her discomfort on the flight home from Las Vegas and how the Travel Kozy made her flight comfortable. Stories like hers demonstrate how a device like the Travel Kozy is important for the traveling public, especially for those that suffer from back and other upper body issues. Since its development and testing, there are several testimonials from travelers that swear by the Travel Kozy and its comfort, but I need you the public to support this effort in bringing this to the mainstream market and making today's travel more comfortable and bearable given the trend in seat designs and overcrowded planes.</p>
<p>Although the Travel Kozy was designed and intended mainly for travel, we have discovered multiple other uses for the device, all reporting back from our in-field testers who are constant business travelers. Below are just a few testimonials!</p>
<p>""I use the Travel Kozy in my hotel room propped on pillows to provide the perfect support while completing my trip reports. It does not collapse like pillows and offer the perfect support""</p>
<p>""I could only drive for 2 hours on long trips before stopping to stretch due to back pains. With the Travel Kozy I was able to drive for 8 hours without stopping""</p>
<p>""I could not sleep on planes and dreaded my long flight from Tampa to Hawaii because of my severe back pains, but with the Travel Kozy, I not only slept for the first time, but did not experience the pains with the trip""</p>
<p>These comments only fueled my desire to make the Travel Kozy a success story and with your help, this can become a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To date I have overcome most of the challenges associated with a product of this type. The prototypes were developed with a local company, the patent was secured in record time (10 months) was featured in Inventors Digest and had a pre-launch on line. Due to some medical issues and other distractions in retirement, the project has lapsed into obscurity and now is the time to bring it back to life. The Travel Kozy is lightweight, measures 6 inches in diameter by 15 inches long in its compressed state and travel bag. The challenge faced is how to get it to market without an infomercial so that people will realize the benefits of the product. This is a daunting task that your assistance will play an important role in making this happen.</p>

<p>The Manneken Trip started 16 months ago on January 2018, and is a big success so far. Since the beginning of the expedition, I (Arnaud Maldague) covered + 12.000 kilometers, through very diverse and extreme environments. If the americas have been crossed before, none were as innovative and challenging, this human powered expedition is a Worldwide first.</p>
<p>- <strong>Skiing &amp; ski-kiting</strong> the Canadian Arctic : 1700 km , 110 days.<br/>- <strong>Cycling</strong> Manitoba : 1900 km , 30 days.<br/>- <strong>Kayaking</strong> the Mississippi river : 3900 km , 103 days.<br/>- <strong>Cycling</strong> USA, Mexico, and Belize : 4500 km, 69 days.</p>

The expedition is now halfway, nonetheless huge challenges remain ahead. And that's why The Manneken Trip needs your support !</p>
<p>- <strong>Sailing</strong> the Caribbean sea : Belize to Guyana.<br/>- <strong>Paddling and walking</strong> the Amazon jungle : Guyana, Manaus Brazil, Peru. <br/>- <strong>Cycling</strong> Peru and Bolivia<br/>- <strong>Horse-riding</strong> Argentina<br/>- <strong>Walking</strong> Patagonia.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why this trip ? What benefits ? </p>
<p>This adventure has as main purpose to demonstrate the perks of going out of your comfort zone. We all have unfulfilled dreams, or unfollowed passions, the expedition wants to demonstrate the perks of following them, spark the energy inside you.

<p>The Manneken trip is also an environmental project, which goal is to promote environmental initiatives in each country. Giving an open voice all over the Americas to socio-environmental initiatives and focus on positive  and concrete actions.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks and challenges are numerous, the journey is paved with them and that's what makes it a unique achievement. Pirates, wildlife, jungle, mountains, the ocean, health issues, extreme weather and dangerous environments are all big threats to be aware of. Most legs of this expedition, if taken apart, offer huge challenges, combined they create a unique, unprecedent and extreme one.</p>
<p>This is why I trained for 2 years prior to the expedition. The Manneken trip has been my single focus since 2016, training all over Europe in each practice of the trip. Each leg has been carefully analysed and accounted for. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hello, our names are Jim and Ryan! We both live in Rigby, Idaho and enjoy creating and building new ideas. Jim moved to Idaho a couple years ago after selling his cattle business in Eastern Washington to help his wife pursue her dream of running a business. They have a young boy and love riding horses and being out in the country. Ryan moved back to Idaho a few months ago after three years of living in Arizona running a small business with his wife. They are both passionate about the outdoors and love traveling and meeting new people. </li>
<li>We have both worked in the construction industry and know how difficult it can be to carry small, yet heavy, equipment around. We also understand the difficulties of storing heavy equipment when you travel or go camping. Combining these two aspects into one idea, we created an assisted lift to haul heavy equipment around the work-site and the camp-site. We are motivated by the joy people see in our products and inventing new ideas to help those around us who enjoy the outdoors and traveling. </li>
<li>This is a new product that has never been on the market before. We have patented the design and it's functionality. We are being our online store and hope to be present in retail stores and construction equipment stores around the nation. </li>

<p>Inspired by the development of social apps combined with our passion for
technology, a team of Italian students, Filippo Ugo, Giovanni Pignatelli, Tommaso Tofacchi and
Federico Magri, decided to develop an application which could present a new
way of reviewing locations and events. The result was Mapp, an app that aims
to provide its users with trustworthy reviews they can rely on. What is special
about it (and what identifies it from Tripadvisor) is that it functions like a
social network which will only allow the user to see the reviews of his/her
friends. This makes them trustworthy since you know who reviewed the
location.
We are very excited about this project and we have plans for its evolution!
Please help us achieve these goals by downloading and testing for yourselves.
“Mapp – Go Worldwide!” is now available on the Apple App and we hope it
will soon be available for Android. Quick link to: <a href=""http://appsto.re/it/B-Ws5.i"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://appsto.re/it/B-Ws5.i</a><br/></p>
<p>Any that believe on the success Mapp could have are very welcome to help us adjust the problems and improve the present functions. </p>
<p>We are going to need 1500€ to help us set up a team of professional developers in order to certify the apps quality and perfect its functions. With the team set up, which will cost around 1000€, we will use the spare money to start campaigning the app through famous websites and blogs in order to reach as many people and attract them into downloading and start using Mapp. </p>
<p><b>Mapp really aims at allowing people to trust the reviews</b> they see and at the same time being able to review anything. We think that reviewing shouldn't be limited to just restaurants and hotels, people should be able to share with their friends whatever they want, a new park that just opened and would be wonderful for a jog in the morning or a shop that has amazing stuff with low prices! If you know who reviewed the place, you know you can trust them, with most location reviewing apps you can see everybody's review, what makes you think that the bad reviews of a restaurant come from the owner of the restaurant in front?</p>
<p>What we dream is a social network that gives the people the opportunity to enter a bar because they know their friends said it's amazing, or giving them the chance to have a variety of cultural sightseeing places to go to during your trip to another country. <b>We want a world wide network that people can trust. </b></p>
<p>If you downloaded the app, you still might see problems or bugs, this is the reason we need your help to help us fix them and allowing you users a better and more efficient experience.

<h2>Perk 1: FacebookLIVE Webinar in Chrome</h2>
<p>I'm just going to say it, if your Facebook LIVE videos are boring or not a lot of people are interacting with them by leaving comments or reacting to it by liking or hearting it, then you need this!</p>
<p>This training is going to teach you everything you need to know when it comes running a webinar inside of Chrome and adding other elements over your LIVE Video.</p>
<h3>You'll Be Able To Add:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Powerpoint/Keynote presentations</li>
<li>Fancy Animated Call-to-Actions<ol>
<li>""<i>Like"" this video</i>
</li>
<li><i>""Heart"" this video</i></li>
<li><i>""Share"" this Video</i></li>
<li><i>Turn on Notification</i></li>
<li><i>Leave a Comment</i></li>
<li><i>Ask a Question</i></li>
<li><i>Say ""hi"" Below</i></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use Logo Animation</li>
<li>Add Watermark</li>
<li>Show Images/Quotes</li>
<li>Play Videos</li>
<li>Use Lower Thirds</li>
<li>Product Launch Countdown</li>
</ol> <h3>Do FacebookLIVE Mini Webinar</h3>
<p>This concept is pretty simple, inside of just doing a LIVE vide with just your face on it, why not spruce it up a little with some flashy images or a presentation to better help teach your audience?</p>
<p>The idea is not to put on a full blown webinar, but instead add interest to your LIVE videos so you step out from the avalanche of bland LIVE videos your audience sees everyday.</p> <h3>Don’t want to do a Webinar?</h3>
<p>This set up is not only for webinars but LIVE videos in general, it adds an extra flare to your on-camera presence, it lets your audience knows you’re serious about what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Instead of a presentation, you can show your audience a video or an image of an inspirational quote and do an entire LIVE video around that. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Do I Need A Special Software? </strong>Yes, in addition to Chrome (which is free) you need a special software that'll allow you to choose what you want to show on your LIVE Video, it will allow you to switch from your camera to your presentation effortless. Module 1 of the training covers this topic in detail.</p>
<p><strong>What's Price of the Software That I Need? </strong>The software is only $20, the price for two coffee, but it's one of the most powerful tool you can own! Most popular Software for FacebookLIVE can cost up to $500.</p>
<p>However, <i><strong>there is a Free version </strong></i>of the software you can use while you go through this training.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Chrome Important? </strong>Because Facebook has a feature to use your Web Camera to go LIVE <i>(instead of your phone) </i>and the option to go LIVE consistently appears on your Facebook when you're using Chrome. Other browsers have this feature but Facebook seems to favor Chrome over the others.</p>
<p><strong>Mac or Windows? </strong>Actually, it works on both platforms! The software runs comfortable and connects perfectly without a hitch!</p>
<p><strong>Can I use a USB Mic? </strong>Yes you absolutely can! I would highly recommend it! Any USB Mic will work as long as it's installed and working on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>What Kind of WebCam Do I need? </strong>Any web camera will do, as long as it's installed and working on your computer then you will be able to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Will I Get to Use Those Fancy Animated Call-To-Actions? </strong>YES!! They are including in the training. </p>
<p><strong>Can I Preview The Animated Call-To-Actions? </strong>Yes you can! Just below this section, there is a video preview of the Animated Call-To-Actions</p>
<p><strong>How Did You Get Your Logo Animation and How Can I Get Mine? </strong>My logo animation was designed by me, I'm an animator. Since your Logo Animation needs to be crafted by someone in order to fit with your brand, I have a service that allows you get your logo animated. Read more below</p>
<h3>FacebookLIVE Call-To-Actions (Bonus)</h3>
<p>The easiest way to get your audience to become interactive on your LIVE video is to show them what you want them to do, if they have to think about what you want them to do then that slows down the process. Instead show them an animation of what you want them to do and watch as the interactive in your LIVE videos skyrocket.</p>
<p><br/>Here's a Preview of the included Bonus of Animated Call-to-Action you can use inside of your FacebookLIVE Webinar in Chrome</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q1zxGqpIKFI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div>While you're LIVE talking to your audience, simply click any of those Call-To-Action to activate them, they'll take up the entire screen to prompt your videos to become more engaging with you and your content. </div>

I'm just going to say it, if your Facebook LIVE videos are boring or not a lot of people are interacting with them by leaving comments or reacting to it by liking or hearting it, then you need this!

 Do FacebookLIVE Mini Webinar
This concept is pretty simple, inside of just doing a LIVE vide with just your face on it, why not spruce it up a little with some flashy images or a presentation to better help teach your audience?
The idea is not to put on a full blown webinar, but instead add interest to your LIVE videos so you step out from the avalanche of bland LIVE videos your audience sees everyday. Don’t want to do a Webinar?
This set up is not only for webinars but LIVE videos in general, it adds an extra flare to your on-camera presence, it lets your audience knows you’re serious about what you’re talking about.
Instead of a presentation, you can show your audience a video or an image of an inspirational quote and do an entire LIVE video around that. The possibilities are endless.
Frequently Asked Questions
Do I Need A Special Software? Yes, in addition to Chrome (which is free) you need a special software that'll allow you to choose what you want to show on your LIVE Video, it will allow you to switch from your camera to your presentation effortless. Module 1 of the training covers this topic in detail.
What's Price of the Software That I Need? The software is only $20, the price for two coffee, but it's one of the most powerful tool you can own! Most popular Software for FacebookLIVE can cost up to $500.
However, there is a Free version of the software you can use while you go through this training.
Why is Chrome Important? Because Facebook has a feature to use your Web Camera to go LIVE (instead of your phone) and the option to go LIVE consistently appears on your Facebook when you're using Chrome. Other browsers have this feature but Facebook seems to favor Chrome over the others.
Mac or Windows? Actually, it works on both platforms! The software runs comfortable and connects perfectly without a hitch!
Can I use a USB Mic? Yes you absolutely can! I would highly recommend it! Any USB Mic will work as long as it's installed and working on your computer.
What Kind of WebCam Do I need? Any web camera will do, as long as it's installed and working on your computer then you will be able to use it.
Will I Get to Use Those Fancy Animated Call-To-Actions? YES!! They are including in the training. 
Can I Preview The Animated Call-To-Actions? Yes you can! Just below this section, there is a video preview of the Animated Call-To-Actions
How Did You Get Your Logo Animation and How Can I Get Mine? My logo animation was designed by me, I'm an animator. Since your Logo Animation needs to be crafted by someone in order to fit with your brand, I have a service that allows you get your logo animated. Read more below
FacebookLIVE Call-To-Actions (Bonus)
The easiest way to get your audience to become interactive on your LIVE video is to show them what you want them to do, if they have to think about what you want them to do then that slows down the process. Instead show them an animation of what you want them to do and watch as the interactive in your LIVE videos skyrocket.
Here's a Preview of the included Bonus of Animated Call-to-Action you can use inside of your FacebookLIVE Webinar in Chrome

While you're LIVE talking to your audience, simply click any of those Call-To-Action to activate them, they'll take up the entire screen to prompt your videos to become more engaging with you and your content.

förhoppning är att så många som möjligt ska ge sig ut och plocka de här godsakerna

</div></div>","My name is Shawn Bouley & I am the Founder of The Rollick Hotel Co. I've spent almost 20 years managing world-class events such as the Winter Olympic Games, NFL Super Bowl, NCAA Men's Basketball Final Four, to name just a few. 
One day I realized sold-out hotel rooms and lodging challenges were becoming a common occurrence at events of all types throughout the country (Super Bowl, Final Four, Coachella Music Festival, Bonnaroo Music Festival, Bassmaster Classic, Comic-Con, etc.) and decided to leverage my industry experience and relationships to take the 'NO' out of 'NO VACANCY' at sports & entertainment events and music festivals. 
I founded The Rollick Hotel Co. to temporarily increase local available lodging with popup hotel villages for fans & event attendees, event workforce & services staff, and corporate brands...where they want to be. 
And I need YOUR help to succeed.    What We Need & What You Get Our team has produced a prototype hotel suite and need $50,000 to fully launch our next phase of operations. 




Our first step is revealing our hotel suite at HD Expo (http://www.hdexpo.com) in Las Vegas in early May, the premier trade show for the hospitality industry. 
The $50,000 will be used to transport the suite back & forth from our home base in Texas, and facilitate travel, site planning, and permits for our initial event clients, defray insurance expenses for the suite, cover legal costs to execute event contracts, and prepare for production of our initial inventory of hotel suite rooms.

Risks & Challenges
 Like any venture, there are plenty of operational risk & regulatory and financial challenges to our success but with our team's track record of managing events like the Olympics, Super Bowl, Final Four, Bassmaster Classic, World Police & Fire Games, and countless others, we are uniquiely qualified to navigate these challenges and execute this concept successfully.

</div><div> <p>Nothing of value and with great reward comes without taking risks and dealing with challenges.  Taking risks and dealing with challenges is second nature to most entrepreneurs, including both of us. We are big dreamers and risk takers, but we are strategic in our approach and we take adequate time to write our plans before implementation.  We have also leveraged our national networks to seek out guidance from seasoned hotel operators and managers. We have been very fortunate to have people in our network who are from Jamaica or know people in Jamaica, who have been very instrumental in introducing us to key government officials, tourism agencies and reliable business owners that have helped us gain knowledge about the landscape of Jamaica and the hospitality industry.  Taking the time to plan and connect with the right people will help minimize our risk level and help us anticipate and resolve challenges we may encounter along the way.  We do not claim to know everything about the hotel business so we will continue to seek knowledge from our advisors who work in management at some of South Beach's finest boutique hotels. We will also hire experienced professionals during the construction phase to ensure will have the most knowledgeable project manager and contractors with verified track records to meet our deadlines to ensure an October opening.</p>

<p>As a marketer for the past 20 years, I have worked on several large construction projects in the US such as the world's largest Museum of African American History which opened in Detroit. I worked closely with the general contractor and spearheaded the community relations, marketing and public relations functions for the museum.  It opened in 1997 as a world class cultural institution.  I am looking forward to opening Rock Cliff Jamaica as a world class luxury resort.</p>

Hello World! I'm Stephanie M. Clark, a serial social entrepreneur. I have been very blessed to do what I love professionally for the past 20 years as an entrepreneur, marketer, founder of two non-profits, business coach & consultant. Two years ago, I decided my next business venture would be starting and operating a bed and breakfast and working within the hospitality industry. Through sharing my dream with friends, I met my business partner Kez Ford, a seasoned automotive exec, project manager and race car enthusiast. Together, we are now Dreamers Resorts.

We believe in divine connections and that God allows our paths to cross with others for a reason, a season and some times a lifetime.  This is our story, a story of how two people with big dreams were brought together to build a business and community in Jamaica! We hope you will help our dream become a reality so that you and others can come experience Rock Cliff Jamaica (RCJ) when we open in October!
God has brought other talented individuals to our ""dream team"" and we want to thank Hugh ""Chef Irie"" Sinclair, RCJ's culinary consultant & executive chef; Priscilla Dames, our resident corporate trainer; Tonii Sumner, our Group Sales Coordinator; Elizabeth Garcia, our Spa Consultant; Linda Stubbs, our Publicist; and Juan Ruiz, our talented videographer.  Our team members are all entrepreneurs who are contributing their time and talents to make our collective dreams come true! Thanks Dream Team!  Also, thank you to Blondie Ras Productions for usage of the Taste The Islands and Island Origins footage.

Through Rock Cliff Jamaica, we want to create a special place where people can come live, play and work without boundaries.  We want people to come and be inspired to dream big and to do what they love, just as we are doing.
We are offering really great perks and packages (50% off our regular room rates) during our campaign to help us reach our fundraising goal of $50,000 to support our renovations and transformation of Rock Cliff Jamaica into an all-inclusive, boutique luxury resort.

Our Community Impact This campaign is not only about helping us raise money to complete our renovations.  It's much bigger than us!  We have plans to create jobs in hospitality and construction as well as business opportunities for Jamaican citizens who will work on our renovations, provide artwork and merchandise for us to display and sell on their behalf, and who we will train and hire to work as part of our Rock Cliff Jamaica team.





Rock Cliff Community Development Initiative (CDI)


Our mission is two-fold: (1) to open and operate a luxury resort, Rock Cliff Jamaica (RCJ) that will provide a five star hospitality and cultural experience for tourists and world travelers; and (2) to position Rock Cliff Jamaica as an anchor institution and catalyst for community development that creates economic, educational and empowerment opportunities that support the social well-being of Jamaican citizens.

Through the Rock Cliff Community Development Initiative, we plan to acquire an adjacent property that will become the Rock Cliff Culinary, Hospitality & Business (CHAB) Training Center anchored by Dreamers Restaurant which will service our resort as well as provide on-the-job training and employment to graduates of CHAB.

The Rock Cliff
CDI model includes:
Stephanie M. Clark, COO, Dreamers Resorts, LLP has extensive experience working in the areas of economic and community development in underserved communities in Michigan (Detroit), New Jersey (Somerset, Newark & Camden), Georgia (Atlanta), and Florida (Miami). With her expertise, vision and vast national network, she will lead the Community Development Initiative in Jamaica.
Risks Equals Rewards
 Nothing of value and with great reward comes without taking risks and dealing with challenges.  Taking risks and dealing with challenges is second nature to most entrepreneurs, including both of us. We are big dreamers and risk takers, but we are strategic in our approach and we take adequate time to write our plans before implementation.  We have also leveraged our national networks to seek out guidance from seasoned hotel operators and managers. We have been very fortunate to have people in our network who are from Jamaica or know people in Jamaica, who have been very instrumental in introducing us to key government officials, tourism agencies and reliable business owners that have helped us gain knowledge about the landscape of Jamaica and the hospitality industry.  Taking the time to plan and connect with the right people will help minimize our risk level and help us anticipate and resolve challenges we may encounter along the way.  We do not claim to know everything about the hotel business so we will continue to seek knowledge from our advisors who work in management at some of South Beach's finest boutique hotels. We will also hire experienced professionals during the construction phase to ensure will have the most knowledgeable project manager and contractors with verified track records to meet our deadlines to ensure an October opening.



As a marketer for the past 20 years, I have worked on several large construction projects in the US such as the world's largest Museum of African American History which opened in Detroit. I worked closely with the general contractor and spearheaded the community relations, marketing and public relations functions for the museum.  It opened in 1997 as a world class cultural institution.  I am looking forward to opening Rock Cliff Jamaica as a world class luxury resort.


We plan to become connected with hotel and tourism trade associations in Jamaica and the U.S. and will aggressively seek out opportunities to gain additional knowledge to ensure we are positioned to address future operational challenges.  
Other Ways You Can Help
 We hope you will support this campaign by purchasing a package to Rock Cliff Jamaica or one of the other perks that fit your budget.  Please help us spread the word and share our campaign with your social media networks by using the Indiegogo sharing tools.
We look forward to sharing the progress of our construction milestones and details about our grand opening.  We especially look forward to hosting you at Rock Cliff Jamaica! Thank you so much for your support!",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

We have been chasing this dream for nearly a decade and the perfect opportunity with the perfect land owner has been secured. Here’s what we’ve been up to so far;</p><ul>
<li>We obtained a contract license to use the site for all free flight and camping activities.</li>
<li>A completed application has been submitted to PASA and the USHPA RRRG to operate a Flight School from the Flight Park. Early indications show an upcoming approval.</li>
<li>We expect to gain approval for a Conditional Use Permit for Boise County commercial recreational operations on Aug 17<sup>th</sup>, 2017.</li>
</ul><p>The ducks are in a row and the ball is rolling, now we’re picking up momentum. Our path with this private 910 acre property is clear and someday we’d like to earn a reputation as a premier, world class flight park.</p><p>Scott Edwards is a Boise local who works hard to provide for his family; 3 great kids and a beautiful wife. He found the sport of speedflying in 2008. Shortly after that he could be found frequently flying around Horseshoe Bend, ID. It was fate that he ended up meeting a real nice land owner of the property he happened to be hiking up to go fly! The owner happily agreed to let Scott and his friends fly on his property. Even gave them a ride to the top! Over the years they built a solid relationship. One day during a safety meeting, Justin Boer and Scott were talking about what their dreams and visions are for the sport we are so passionate about. About a year later and a lot of hard work, here we are! Scott had the location and Justin brings to the table an extensive training program and close ties with major industry manufacturers. Justin has been instructing paragliding and speedflying as a certified USHPA Avd/Miniwing/Tandem Instructor for the past 8 years. Since 2013, he’s lived in HI focusing on recovery from a spinal cord injury. Because of that, he’s deeply involved with adaptive sports, enjoys inspiring other athletes and is developing an adaptive paragliding non-profit organization. This will eventually fit very well at the HSB Flight Park because it is such a reliable, safe and beautiful site to fly at.</p><p>Our goal with this campaign is to raise enough funds to properly set up and develop a flight park that offers safety training on forgiving terrain and reliable conditions, employment opportunities, equipment demos, and a super fun place to hang out! The Flight Park will unite pilots from around the world and strengthen our community in the US. This campaign is important to us because the future of our sport is depending on positive exposure, safety training and flying sites that build up the community and that’s what we want to be able to provide with HSB Flight Park.</p><p>By contributing to our cause you will be helping us achieve something of such a magnitude that it will go down in the history books of the sport of paragliding. We will build the largest and most renowned Flight Park in the US.</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>Here’s some things we need (money raised from this campaign goes 100% towards these items):</p><ul>
<li>2x Shuttle Vehicles</li>
<li>Big Shade Area (metal or black shade cloth with grommets)</li>
<li>2x Shipping Container</li>
<li>Garage Doors</li>
<li>Solar Power Kit</li>
<li>Future Restroom and Shower Building</li>
<li>Picnic Tables</li>
<li>Astroturf Launches &amp; at Shaded Home Base Area</li>
<li>Sun Shade Tents</li>
<li>Lawn Mowers (riding?)</li>
<li>Weed Wackers</li>
<li>Rakes &amp; Shovels</li>
<li>Material for Fires Pit/BBQ</li>
<li>Generators</li>
<li>Wood (for equipment shed and shade construction)</li>
<li>Pavers</li>
<li>Sand</li>
<li>Gravel</li>
<li>12x 1st Aid Kits</li>
<li>12x Fire Extinguishers</li>
<li>2x Snake Bite Kits</li>
<li>Signage Material</li>
<li>Holding Tank (showers &amp; drinking water?)</li>
<li>Hand Wash Station</li>
</ul><p>Here’s some things that we are currently working on:</p><ul>
<li>Mowing &amp; Grading 20+ acres for LZs (so far by donated push mowers)</li>
<li>Mowing 3+ acres for Launches and Access Roads (so far by donated push mowers)</li>
<li>Mowing &amp; Grading 2+ acres Camping Area (so far by donated push mowers)</li>
<li>Spring Fed “Rinse Off Station”</li>
<li>Building Kitchen (need shipping containers first)</li>
<li>Removing Posts, Corral, 1 Mile+ Barbed Fencing (and all other obstacles in LZ areas)</li>
<li>Electricity, Wifi, Cell Phone Booster and Well for Drinking Water (future)Signage</li>
</ul><p>We set the funding amount to $50,000 because we will have at least that amount of costs going into the preliminary development. Future projects will exceed this amount as we have ideas about, but not limited to, a restaurant/bar in the LZ.</p><p>How exciting is it to be involved from the beginning of something that will change so many people’s lives?! Excited is an understatement. We are offering some really amazing perks for your generous donations and we’ll put you on our newsletter so you can always stay updated with the latest improvement to the park. When you donate to this campaign you instantly become part of a very special community and we consider you family. We’ll do our best to have our park in top shape so we can be there to cater to every pilot and non-pilot member’s needs. Even if we do not meet our goal, all the money raised will go directly in to the park improvements.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>The biggest challenge so far other than all the physical labor of building the Flight Park, is going to be the public hearing to get our Conditional Use Permit on Aug 17<sup>th</sup>. In addition, we have spent a ton of time preparing for the Flight School insurance through PASA and the RRRG and we’re currently entering the final stages for approval. There is no doubt, we will succeed with both of these important stages.</p><p>We are qualified to overcome these hurdles because we spent countless hours preparing plans for any scenario that may occur at the Flight Park. We’re ready to answer any questions that may arise and the community is very much supporting our efforts for the HSB Flight Park.</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>It’s totally understandable that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. We are looking for assistance with any items on the above list, maybe you have a connection for a discount, have something laying in your garage or wouldn’t mind coming out to the park and getting your hands dirty. There’s lots of work to do and we welcome any type of help from our family, of course the cooler will always be full of cold beverages.</p><p>Another effective way to support our campaign would be to write a quick note sharing this page on your social media pages, it’s super easy to use the Indiegogo share tools. Email, message or text your friends and family showing your enthusiasm, passion and desire for the success of HorseShoe Bend Flight Park.

Our path with this private 910 acre property is clear and someday we’d like to earn a reputation as a premier, world class flight park.Scott Edwards is a Boise local who works hard to provide for his family; 3 great kids and a beautiful wife. He found the sport of speedflying in 2008. Shortly after that he could be found frequently flying around Horseshoe Bend, ID. It was fate that he ended up meeting a real nice land owner of the property he happened to be hiking up to go fly! The owner happily agreed to let Scott and his friends fly on his property. Even gave them a ride to the top! Over the years they built a solid relationship. One day during a safety meeting, Justin Boer and Scott were talking about what their dreams and visions are for the sport we are so passionate about. About a year later and a lot of hard work, here we are! Scott had the location and Justin brings to the table an extensive training program and close ties with major industry manufacturers. Justin has been instructing paragliding and speedflying as a certified USHPA Avd/Miniwing/Tandem Instructor for the past 8 years. Since 2013, he’s lived in HI focusing on recovery from a spinal cord injury. Because of that, he’s deeply involved with adaptive sports, enjoys inspiring other athletes and is developing an adaptive paragliding non-profit organization. This will eventually fit very well at the HSB Flight Park because it is such a reliable, safe and beautiful site to fly at.Our goal with this campaign is to raise enough funds to properly set up and develop a flight park that offers safety training on forgiving terrain and reliable conditions, employment opportunities, equipment demos, and a super fun place to hang out! The Flight Park will unite pilots from around the world and strengthen our community in the US. This campaign is important to us because the future of our sport is depending on positive exposure, safety training and flying sites that build up the community and that’s what we want to be able to provide with HSB Flight Park.By contributing to our cause you will be helping us achieve something of such a magnitude that it will go down in the history books of the sport of paragliding. We will build the largest and most renowned Flight Park in the US.What We Need & What You GetHere’s some things we need (money raised from this campaign goes 100% towards these items):
2x Shuttle Vehicles
Big Shade Area (metal or black shade cloth with grommets)
2x Shipping Container
Garage Doors
Solar Power Kit
Future Restroom and Shower Building
Picnic Tables
Astroturf Launches & at Shaded Home Base Area
Sun Shade Tents
Lawn Mowers (riding?)
Weed Wackers
Rakes & Shovels
Material for Fires Pit/BBQ
Generators
Wood (for equipment shed and shade construction)
Pavers
Sand
Gravel
12x 1st Aid Kits
12x Fire Extinguishers
2x Snake Bite Kits
Signage Material
Holding Tank (showers & drinking water?)
Hand Wash Station
Here’s some things that we are currently working on:
Mowing & Grading 20+ acres for LZs (so far by donated push mowers)
Mowing 3+ acres for Launches and Access Roads (so far by donated push mowers)
Mowing & Grading 2+ acres Camping Area (so far by donated push mowers)
Spring Fed “Rinse Off Station”
Building Kitchen (need shipping containers first)
Removing Posts, Corral, 1 Mile+ Barbed Fencing (and all other obstacles in LZ areas)
Electricity, Wifi, Cell Phone Booster and Well for Drinking Water (future)Signage
We set the funding amount to $50,000 because we will have at least that amount of costs going into the preliminary development. Future projects will exceed this amount as we have ideas about, but not limited to, a restaurant/bar in the LZ.How exciting is it to be involved from the beginning of something that will change so many people’s lives?! Excited is an understatement. We are offering some really amazing perks for your generous donations and we’ll put you on our newsletter so you can always stay updated with the latest improvement to the park. When you donate to this campaign you instantly become part of a very special community and we consider you family. We’ll do our best to have our park in top shape so we can be there to cater to every pilot and non-pilot member’s needs. Even if we do not meet our goal, all the money raised will go directly in to the park improvements.Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge so far other than all the physical labor of building the Flight Park, is going to be the public hearing to get our Conditional Use Permit on Aug 17th. In addition, we have spent a ton of time preparing for the Flight School insurance through PASA and the RRRG and we’re currently entering the final stages for approval. There is no doubt, we will succeed with both of these important stages.We are qualified to overcome these hurdles because we spent countless hours preparing plans for any scenario that may occur at the Flight Park. We’re ready to answer any questions that may arise and the community is very much supporting our efforts for the HSB Flight Park.Other Ways You Can HelpIt’s totally understandable that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. We are looking for assistance with any items on the above list, maybe you have a connection for a discount, have something laying in your garage or wouldn’t mind coming out to the park and getting your hands dirty. There’s lots of work to do and we welcome any type of help from our family, of course the cooler will always be full of cold beverages.Another effective way to support our campaign would be to write a quick note sharing this page on your social media pages, it’s super easy to use the Indiegogo share tools. Email, message or text your friends and family showing your enthusiasm, passion and desire for the success of HorseShoe Bend Flight Park. We are so grateful for all of you that have and will spread the word of mouth! It’s been a great journey to get to this point and we’re ready to make some noise about the premier flight park location in Horseshoe Bend, ID.Mahalo, Gracias, Arigato, Khob Chai, Obrigado, Danke, Grazie, XieXie, Spasibo, Merci, Chur, Мерси, Dik, Hvala Vam, Teşekkür Ederim, Gomabseubnida, Takk,Thank You!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are thrilled to be back to introduce our Key Titan product line! We started our crowdfunding career with Pry.Me, a penny-sized titanium bottle opener and more recently ran a special Kickstarter “All in 1” 7-day campaign with Brew Soldier, a key-sized titanium bottle opener. We have gotten tremendous support for Pry.Me and Brew Soldier both on Kickstarter and here on Indiegogo and are excited share our patent pending Key Titan lineup!        Comparison of Standard Key Ring vs Key Titan - Shake Test   KT5: Put a Ring on ItThe KT5 uses a Suppression Ring to silence your keys.

The elastic is in an optimal position for varying key lengths allowing easy storing and deployment of individual keys.

To store the key back into your Key Titan slide the elastic loop up and push the key back into position:Key Access on KT7 (Applies to KT10) Separate Key and Hang AreasWe gave Key Titan two clip areas, one for keys (green area) and one for hanging the Key Titan unit (red area) removing the chance of an accidental key drop when clipping your Key Titan to your pant loop, purse handle, or other objects.Separate key opening (green area) and hang opening (red area) to prevent accidental key drops when attaching or removing Key Titan. KT5: 2-Step Key RemovalYour keys are important to you…so we have added a 2-step removal to all the products in the Key Titan lineup to ensure they don’t unexpectedly get away from you:Step 1) Open Closure GateStep 2) Unhook Suppression Ring from the Suppression Ring Hook and push into the Closure Gate Opening2-Step Removal of Keys from KT5 KT7 and KT10: 2-Step Key RemovalYour keys are important to you…so we have added a 2-step removal to all the products in the Key Titan lineup to ensure they don’t unexpectedly get away from you:Step 1) Untuck Keys from the Elastic Band Step 2) Open Closure Gate2-Step Key Removal of Keys from KT7 (Applies to KT10) Concealed Bottle Opener (KT5, KT7, KT10)As you may already know from our previous crowdfunding projects with the penny-sized Pry.Me and key-sized Brew Soldier bottle openers, we love inconspicuous bottle openers which keep your keys professional but always beer ready.

How on earth did we pack 100 Lumens into such a compact design? Simple, we upgraded to a state-of-the-art SUPER THIN SMD LED Module offering a higher lumen output for lower energy consumption. 

 
How did we finish this tiny, powerful key torch? Our signature black aerospace aluminum and a NEW SOLID Titanium BULL3T. One of the most notable advantages of titanium is its strength. It’s among the strongest and most durable metals on the planet, which is why we used it for BULL3T. In fact, titanium has the highest strength-to-density ratio of any metallic element on the periodic table, making it the best possible metal to use for a tiny flashlight. Another key advantage associated with titanium is its natural resistance to rust and corrosion. We've come a long way since 2015.

<p>I can still contract out some production to a small local operation which would allow even greater variety, I would sacrifice margin.

When she asked I was taken aback because it was snowing so hard outside that I could not see the building across the street. My clever moment came when I asked ""Do I get a badge for that"" and she replied ""That will depend on your effort"". So I rushed home got my scouting hat and handkerchief for around my neck, packed my ruc sack with comics and potato chips....ok that last  part is not true. Camp Love Scouts was created to recognize your scandalous scouting achievements and provide incentive for more.So I was thinking this could be fun, and what the world needs now, (to borrow a phrase from the 60's)- Is love sweet love. Okay I am borrowing from a guy named Burt (Who was married to Sheelana the woodland temptress) ok different Burt....Bacharach.Camp Love Scouts is your opportunity to enjoy the great outdoors while making memories that will keep you smiling for years to come. When others ask if you have been out biking lately, or boating, or climbing they might also wonder what those blushes are for.You have the scandalous outdoor recreation, We have the reward for that! All in a format that your grandmother could approve. (Yay!)This IndieGoGo funding will provide us with:
 Production equipment - $6,200
Start up inventory - $19,500
Web page design, hosting, other marketing - $9,400
Packing, shipping, inventory hardware and software - $1,350
12 months 8-5 customer service outsource, telephone, cable $6,800
Goal is to provide a humorous, slightly suggestive, unique high quality product at a fair price with high customer satisfaction.

Risks, Challenges, and Impact:
Even though I have a bachelors degree in Marketing as well as Accounting and have plenty of independent business experience I still struggle with the confidence in getting the word out about the business and the concept.

I have searched out production opportunities in Haiti, and the states of Kentucky, Michigan, Washington, and Wisconsin. So there is still a high likelihood that success will travel to other localities and not just our small city.

Other than the t-shirts the remaining merit awards can be contracted out to manufacturers and I can still order quantities that get good cost points.

<div>Have you ever been caught in a situation were you need some cash, and there's not a ATM machine in sight.

<div>I do a lot of outdoor sports in Yorkshire (England), its an amazing place but the weather can turn very quickly. I find simple solutions are often the best, I set out  with these key requirements for the design:</div>

<p> My first prototype used plastic but after a crash on my mountain bike it split, so I decided to use aluminium as its strong yet light. The screw top is the best reseable solution, as it offers far superior waterproof seal compared with flaps and push together seals.</p>

<div>As Series Main Partner to the Extreme Sailing Series™, Land Rover presented the Above and Beyond Award to relative newcomers, Team Turx powered by Kaya Ropes, co-skippered by Edhem Dirvana and Mitch Booth. The team posted six podium positions, one race win and were the third highest point scoring team on the final day. Land Rover’s Global Brand Ambassador, Hannah White, commented, <i>“It’s been a tough venue for the teams, who have been buffeted by strong winds and waves of up to three metres. Showing grit, determination and strength of mind, Team Turx powered by Kaya Ropes was also revealed by SAP Sailing Analytics to be the fastest starting and upwind boat of the Act on average – they’re certainly ones to watch.”</i><br/>

Gel sen de takımın bir parçası ol ve ilk defa bir Türk takımının bu dünya etkinliğinde yer almasına imkan sağla ve şampiyon olmasına destek ol!

******************************************************ENGLISH SUMMARY


Donate and be part of a winning team andt help Turkey's first ever Extreme Sailing team to participate in the full 2015 Series.  
In 2014, for the first time ever, a Turkish was invited to participate in the World Extreme Sailing Series as a ""guest"".  This was the result of months of hard work and practice since 2011.  In 2015, the team was invited to participate in the whole series as a real competitor!  The team delivered 3 wins from the first leg of the race in Singapore and took home Land Rover Above and Beyond Award from Muscat, the second leg along with an overall 5th degree!  We now have 6 more races to go!

And the team needs your support to complete the remainder of the legs.  Your contribution is not only important financially but also in terms of count of individual supporters.  The more supporters we an show (and of course the more money we can raise), the more our chances are with big corporate sponsors.

So please donate....what ever amount you like or one of the set amounts on the right to claim one of our many ""thank you gifts"".
Want to more about us?  See us on the Extreme Sailing Series homepage:

Thank you in advance!
Your contribution and support means a lot to us!
Team TurX wins Land Rover Above and Beyond Award in Muscat for their spirited performance!
As Series Main Partner to the Extreme Sailing Series™, Land Rover presented the Above and Beyond Award to relative newcomers, Team Turx powered by Kaya Ropes, co-skippered by Edhem Dirvana and Mitch Booth. The team posted six podium positions, one race win and were the third highest point scoring team on the final day. Land Rover’s Global Brand Ambassador, Hannah White, commented, “It’s been a tough venue for the teams, who have been buffeted by strong winds and waves of up to three metres. Showing grit, determination and strength of mind, Team Turx powered by Kaya Ropes was also revealed by SAP Sailing Analytics to be the fastest starting and upwind boat of the Act on average – they’re certainly ones to watch.”",3.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>My application and much more is <a href=""http://ja-natuurlijk.com/site2/adam-zaretsky/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a></b></p>
<p><b>The reason for this study was a permit application for an exhibition involving zebra fish embryos which would be injected with genetically-modified (GM) cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). In dealing with this request it became clear that the present assessment framework has no provision for exhibitions. There is a trend in art in which biological (living) materials are used, treated and exhibited. Government, risk assessors, artists and the general public hold differing views about the desirability and admissibility of such activities. The differences make it clear that there is a clash between the technological possibilities and how public opinion is formed. </b><b>The use of higher order organisms and genetic modification without a primarily scientific goal would appear to heighten the discussion.</b></p>
<p><b>COGEM notes that most applications of GMOs and organisms in exhibitions are covered by the existing regulatory framework. COGEM observes that certain niche applications of BioArt, specifically combinations of GMOs with embryos, however, are covered only by the GMO legislation.

<p>A short excerpt:</p>
<p>Things are gettng tricky with episode 3. <a href=""http://www.diysect.com/fearoftheunknown/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fear of the Unknown</a> which should is out on vimeo as of today!</p>
<p>The episode delves into the discussions surrounding synthetic biology. On the one hand, a project like the Kickstarter-funded <a href=""http://www.glowingplant.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Glowing Plant </a>is creating controversy by bringing synthetic biology to the consumer market in the form of a plant that glows in the dark. Its developers' rhetoric is fairly unconvincing (at least as far as i am concerned.) On the other hand, the technology watchdog group <a href=""http://www.etcgroup.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ETC</a>. Its members fear the lack of regulation (the plant doesn't require any form of approval in the U.S. since it is not food) and the potentially damaging impact that the release of the plant might have on the environment.

</div></div>","Whats up with VASTAL?

I run a public life arts school: VASTAL (The Vivoarts School for Transgenic Aesthetics Ltd.) I am really into
DIY-BIO, citizen science and Bioart in terms of maker spaces and hacker
culture, biopunk and pure, amateur research without the big science aftertaste.
VASTAL provides open to the public art and science labs involving: Eco Art,
Food Art, Bio Art, Transpecies Art and Body Art. We specialize in hybrid,
living, interactive, hands-on, alt-educational, exhibition style
biotech-embodied art production labs. VASTAL has been asked to take part in events, think-tanks, exhibitions and advising in Greece and Portugal in the next two months!

Back Story:



My writings about VASTAL public labs focused on an array of legal,
ethical, social and libidinal implications of biotechnological and all live art materials and
methods. 

That kind of insight earned me a Doctorate (I/EAR, RPI, 2012)

The Dissertation earned me a book deal at a peer-reviewed university
press (PSU Press)

In the name of the book deal, I applied for a post-doctoral
Research position and I got that too!


I
am now a Next Nature
post-graduate ARA (Advanced Research Associate) and receipient of the ARA I-Node Grant for 2014-2015 of the I-Node of the
Planetary Collegium programme and its host Institution – the Ionion Center of Arts and Culture (based on the Island of
Cephalonia in Greece.)
Besides my utterly limited cash, everything is on course. ;)







Who am I?

I am Adam Zaretsky, Ph.D., a Wet-Lab Art Practitioner mixing Ecology, Biotechnology, Non-human Relations, Body Performance and Gastronomy. I stage lively, hands-on bioart production labs based on topics such as: foreign species invasion (pure/impure), radical food science (edible/inedible), jazz bioinformatics (code/flesh), tissue culture (undead/semi-alive), transgenic design issues (traits/desires), interactive ethology (person/machine/non-human) and physiology (performance/stress).
A former researcher at the MIT department of biology, for the past fifteen years, I have been teaching experimental bioart classes at: San Francisco State University (SFSU), SymbioticA (UWA), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), University of Leiden’s The Arts and Genomic Centre (TAGC), Waag Society, Das Arts, Carnegie Melon University (CMU) and New York University (NYU). I am currently Media Arts Faculty in the School of Communication and the
Arts at Marist College. My life is really fun and I like
teaching, parenting and taking my art on the road. I like my son to see the
world with me too. We have a lot of fun and he learns about international
culture, meets smart and diverse people and generally gets to explore.



What do I
want to fund?
Primarily,
I want to make two important presentations/exhibitions happen:
I have been invited to Greece in April and Portugal in May. 
They are both important to my career and
the venues are professional, funky and smart:
A: The trip to Greece is a part
of my post-doctoral research position requirement. Part of this trip involves
poster presentations at the following venues:
•   Ionion Center for the Arts and
Culture
•   Art Athina, Athens International Art
Fair
The postdoctoral research part of this trip aids in continuance
towards development of a fine working draft of my first book for peer-review.
Along with the poster session, I will continue fulfilling my professional
development as an international post-doctoral research associate by mixing and
co-advising graduate and doctoral students from the multimode-multinode
gathering of students from: the Swiss, Italian and Greek Nodes of the program.
It’s a very cool big deal at an artist’s residency: the Ionion Center for the Arts and Culture on the island of Cephalonia. I would like to offer an
art-lab as part of my appreciation of Katerina Karoussos, Director of the
I-Node, Planetary Collegium, my host in Cephalonia, Ionion Center for the Arts
and Culture and the Director of the whole program, Professor Roy Ascott.
B: 
I have been invitated to participate in exhibition in Portugal. This one
is curated by Marta de Menezes Graça, Director of Cultivamos Cultura. She is organizing an
international exhibition and Conference called for the Spring/Summer
of 2015. The exhibition she is organising is primarily devoted to new media in
art, with a focus on experimentation and research. Cultivamos Cultura is a
nonprofit organization dedicated to the
promotion of the creative arts within a local community in the Southwest of
Portugal. The main focus is the exploration of new avenues for artistic
manifestations, namely new media (with an emphasis in technology) and new
discourses. My family is actually invited for three weeks, to develop a new art exhibition
and create with an internationally known bunch of bioart literati.

Why do I
need to ask for money? 

Along with exhibition, the trips are built to develop a fine working draft of my first book for peer-review and continue the international post-doctoral research associate position. The goals are worthwhile. Here is the crux of it. Both the book and the research position
are affiliated with Universities, but both projects are not funded. In fact,
the postdoc charges tuition and I pay for airfare. The postdoc is low residency
and it allows you to keep your job but it does not pay. I did receive a grant
that made my tuition significantly lower for which I am thankful. I
certainly am not fluid enough to do all of the above without some help. Both scenarios
are important to my career and the venues and company engaged are professional, fun and personal. So, I am turning to crowd funding to make it all happen.

 How much
will it cost?
The trip for Greece is planned to leave for Greece April 17th
and return May 2nd. In order to be able to attend, I need to pay my
tuition for the year. Tuition is due in April and should be covered for the
year. The cost of tuition about $5000.00 (minimum amount due this session is
$3000) It costs $2000-$3000 in airfare round-trip from New York to
Athens-Cephalonia (for myself and my son and perhaps a friend to care for him
when I am in postdoctoral advising sessions.) If I want to offer a lab or two,
I should provide my own materials and some documentation. I like healthy exorbidance
in my labs and a nice production value. I am sure the Ionion Center
for the Arts and Culture would be able to raise some funds but this is a gift
world culture and I would like to thank my hosts by sponsoring something for
them too! One of my labs can be had produced handily for $1110.00. There is also all
the extraneous costs: transportation, food, toiletries, etc. So, I have asked
for $11110.00 to make it all happen.

What
happens if VASTAL reaches our goal and then more money comes in?
 Well, I do need to take my time and write in July and August.
The book needs effort and when I am off from work is the best time to make big
leaps. I also have an offer to run a summer VASTAL residency in the Catskills (New York
State country, two hours north of Manhattan) in collaboration with Grace Exhibition
Space, Body Art and Performance Space and funky involved folk. That could be a
wild sleep away camp! I would also like to get two of my major artworks (the
VASTAL Virginarium and the Errorarium shipped to the US for further use and
experimentation. If this works I may startup a more permanent version of
VASTAL. I am considering forming a biotech company for artist researchers only. Perhaps with a street level clinic for medical tourism, psychic fertility etc. I suppose time will tell. The future looks favorable and even bold.
Lets just see if we can get our shows!


What if I don’t reach my goal?
Well, nothing is perfect. Leonard Cohen says, “there is a
Crack in everything, that’s How the light gets IN!” If there is enough money to
pay tuition and fly to Greece, I will continue my ARA post doc with the
Planetary Collegium. If there is only enough money to go to Portugal, then that is what I will do. On the other hand, I am optimistic in
general, sometimes to a fault! Life goes on and all will be well. I just think
these projects are worth making happen.

 
08.01.2015 | GMOs on display The use of genetically modified organisms in exhibitions (CGM/141219-01)
http://www.cogem.net/index.cfm/en/publications/publicatie/gmos-on-display-the-use-of-genetically-modified-organisms-in-exhibition
The Netherlands Commission on Genetic Modification (COGEM) was asked by the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment (IenM) to prepare a report on the societal or public interest aspects of exhibitions involving the use of GMOs.
My application and much more is HERE
The reason for this study was a permit application for an exhibition involving zebra fish embryos which would be injected with genetically-modified (GM) cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). In dealing with this request it became clear that the present assessment framework has no provision for exhibitions. There is a trend in art in which biological (living) materials are used, treated and exhibited. Government, risk assessors, artists and the general public hold differing views about the desirability and admissibility of such activities. The differences make it clear that there is a clash between the technological possibilities and how public opinion is formed. The use of higher order organisms and genetic modification without a primarily scientific goal would appear to heighten the discussion.
COGEM notes that most applications of GMOs and organisms in exhibitions are covered by the existing regulatory framework. COGEM observes that certain niche applications of BioArt, specifically combinations of GMOs with embryos, however, are covered only by the GMO legislation. As a consequence, objections or a general sense of public unease could arise in society.

This report is about the use of genetic modification in BioArt: the altering of genetic material in microorganisms, plants and animals or combinations of these in exhibitions. It sets out the various elements involved in the use of GMOs in exhibitions.

DIYsect. A series about the 

DIY Biology & Biology-Art 
intersection releases chapter 
3: Fear of the Unknown 
today. 

The article/review by Regine of We-Make-Money-Not-Art (wmmna.com) is HERE.  

A short excerpt:
Things are gettng tricky with episode 3. Fear of the Unknown which should is out on vimeo as of today!
The episode delves into the discussions surrounding synthetic biology. On the one hand, a project like the Kickstarter-funded Glowing Plant is creating controversy by bringing synthetic biology to the consumer market in the form of a plant that glows in the dark. Its developers' rhetoric is fairly unconvincing (at least as far as i am concerned.) On the other hand, the technology watchdog group ETC. Its members fear the lack of regulation (the plant doesn't require any form of approval in the U.S. since it is not food) and the potentially damaging impact that the release of the plant might have on the environment. Somewhere in the middle is artistAdam Zaretsky who has long used his provocative performances to try and raise a broader debate about what is ethical or not in the field of synthetic biology. There's this great moment in the film when he explains that we don't really know what we are doing and that we need to stop and think before we 'fuck up our world' beyond human control.
On a side note, i believe we need to see more of Zaretsky's provocations and reflections here in Europe, so let's help him fund his next trip to the old continent.

Three major innovations make our shoes unbelievably lightweight-----only 8 ounces
 

1. Cooperating with Ortholite®, the world-renowned insole manufacturer, we designed a dual-layer insole - The top side that touches your feet is Merino wool and the bottom layer is full of air pockets that support your feet with a lightweight structure.
 

2. Talent Jogger uses ultra-lightweight, rubberized EVA for its outsole compound. 
 

A unibody construction such as this, provides both excellent abrasion performance and running-shoe elasticity.
 

3. Our original Hive-Impact™ outsole construction is the core innovation occupying the rear 2/3rds of the outsoles. 
 

With hexagon cavities, this design reduces even more weight from our insoles.
 

When combined, these innovations greatly reduce the weight of the overall shoe while still providing comfortable, all-day support. A pair of Talent Joggers is on average, 15% lighter than a typical pair of wool sneakers.
 

A pair of Talent Joggers is on average, 15% lighter than a typical pair of wool sneakers.
 

 
 


According to our ergonomics research, the proprietary Hive-Impact™ technology makes the rear 2/3rds of the outsole considerably more stable and structurally more rigid, while retaining the flexibility of the forefoot section.
 

The hexagon structure also supports your feet better than a traditional solid outsole when you walk, or even during jogging. 
In general, with our cutting-edge technologies, Talent Jogger can keep strong support for at least 18 months.
 
 


Merino wool is prized for footwear because it naturally wicks away moisture while remaining breathable. It continuously absorbs small amounts of liquid into its fibers, then wicking moisture away through small openings in the woven fabric.
 

 This results in a shoe that is never too hot, eliminating perspiration build up and leaving your feet dry and comfortable. 
The unique open-cell structure of Ortholite® foam creates a moisture management system, helping to remove moisture and provide a cooler, drier, healthier environment. It also contains active anti-microbial agents to prevent fungi from growing inside your shoes.
 

Talent Jogger are the ultimate in comfort for bare feet.
 

 
 

Merino wool is easy to care for. Talent Joggers may be cleaned in your washing machine and air dried.  (Shoelaces and insoles are still recommended to wash by hand separately)
 

 
 

Sustainability is part of our mission.
1. Merino wool can be fully recycled and is often reused as material for carpets.
2. Ortholite® uses recycled rubber in every pair of insoles, and bio-oil from castor beans which reduces the need for petroleum-based ingredients in insoles.
 
Take a closer look at some other details
· Latex-free, elastic holding straps on the shoe tongue
· 3M® reflective tape heel-loop
· Eyelets with custom computerized embroidery

Detail makes perfect

· Heel counter with recyclable TPU insert
· Long-lasting PU collar foam (from premium sports bras) Ideal for All Styles and Occasions

Headed up by Mike Ludgrove, the group's combined labour of over 40 years has brought the construction of the project, Helena, to near completion. A 60ft classic yacht due to be launched in spring 2018.</p><p>As the date for her launch draws ever closer, we now look for assistance from backers to make the final step from workshop to water possible.  In return we'd like to offer you the opportunity to step aboard and set sail with us upon her maiden voyage.</p><p>We are offering a range of sailing experiences from one day coastal hops in the South West of England to charters in the French Riviera, the Mediterannean and even Christmas in the Caribbean!</p><p>As a boy Mike was given the chance to sail with the London Sailing Project, a charitable organisation which allows underpriviliged young people the opportunity to experience an adventure at sea. This formative experience remained with Mike through several non nautical related endeavours in his early adult life until he was in a position to embark upon creating his dream. As homage to this early inspiration, Helena will be used in the same spirit, to help and inspire young people who would not ordinarily get the chance to do such a thing.</p><p>In order to get Helena in the water we need your pledge; with this contribution we can procure over 2,500 sqft of canvas and an expert sailmaker. These sails will harness the power of the wind, withstanding loads of up to 30 tons, powering Helena to any destination in the world.</p><p>The funds will also be used to transport Helena to the waters edge and crane her in, cover the cost of creating the upholstery and furthermore, provide her with a bank of batteries to power the onboard systems such as navigational equipment, water desalinator, lighting and entertainment. What remains of £80,000 after these things have been paid for will cover mooring fees while system tests and sea trials are carried out to ensure that everything is working smoothly.</p><p>Then comes the best part. When these tasks are complete you'll be invited to come aboard, join us for a drink or two at one of our cocktail parties, bring a friend along and we'll show you around Helena, the project you helped to complete. Or for a sail, whether you choose to keep it local, taking a hop along the Devon and Cornwall coast, or joining us somewhere a little more exotic.</p><p><strong>Corporate Daysail  </strong>is a tailored package aimed at staff groups/ businesses for team building or one day holiday/ adventure experience and is priced for the entire boat for a group of up to 8 people with Champagne reception and 3 course dinner included. The day will begin when you and your team are welcomed aboard with a champagne reception at the recently redeveloped Royal William Yard in Plymouth. This spectacular historic naval yard is the perfect place from which to set off on an afternoon sail around the natural harbour of Plymouth Sound wich offers a beautiful but sheltered location for those who have not earned their sea legs. Your group will be active participants in crewing Helena; under expert supervision you will be shown some basic navigation, how to sheet in the sails and even get your hands on the wheel. As the sun begins to set, you will return for dinner to the William Yard which boasts a selection of great bars and restaurants.

Growing up in a deprived area in the south of London in 1950's post war Britain, it was just such an experience that gave Mike the purpose that he found and lead him to where he stands today.

You can climb the ladder and walk stern to bow on her swept teak deck as we do every day, go below and see the galley, the nav station and the ample saloon, all with cheerfully light, solid maple cabinetry. Helena will reach the water one way or another; if we don't reach our goal we will explore investment partnerships. With this in mind we chose to go the route of flexible funding because whatever is raised will help and all pledges will be fulfilled.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After traveling to many campground across the country I found most campgrounds are ill-equipped to handle special needs guest. After many conversations with families dealing with a disabled loved one I often heard that same stories of how they would love to take the family camping but would be impossible do to the lack of true handicap accessible campgrounds. Hearing this broke my heart so I decided to do something about it. With the help of my fiancee, family, friends, and great people like you I can make this campground come true for so many people!</p>

I know there are good people out there that want to be part of such a unique project
If I fail to open all money raised will be donated to several charities!

We're Ryan and Stacy, and we moved to Isla Bastimentos to found <a href=""https://www.seamonkeybocasdeltoro.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Sea Monkey</a> in August of 2014. A lot of people dream of quitting their jobs, moving to a tropical island, and opening their own bed and breakfast, and <strong><i>we did it</i></strong>!</div><div> </div><div>While we both had several years of experience in the hospitality industry, we were complete newbies when it came to construction and to operating a business overseas.

Get yourself a stay at a discounted rate that <strong>can be redeemed any time in the future</strong>!</div><div> </div><h2>Our Budget</h2><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527284217/b7gbfq7mmezbma4rrpva.jpg"" src=""""/></div><div>
<p>After working with several local builders and suppliers, we've created <strong>a budget of $39,000</strong> for the first of our three new loft-style overwater suites, including labor, materials, furniture, decor, and permits.</p>
<p>Budget breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Building materials and furniture/decor: $19,840</p></li>
<li><p>Labor and permits: $15,000</p></li>
<li><p>Chakra bags/postcards/t-shirts/totes and shipping: $1000</p></li>
<li><p>Indiegogo's 5% fee on funds raised: $2000</p></li>
<li>Stripe's 2.9% fee on credit card pledges: $1160</li>
</ul>
<p>We know from prior experience that project costs can increase over projections due to changes in the availability of materials and fluctuations in material and labor prices, so we are seeking to raise <strong>$45,000</strong> to ensure that -- even if unexpected hiccups arise -- we can complete our new bungalow <strong>by January of 2019</strong>.</p>
<p>If we are lucky enough to come in under budget or to exceed our goal, any extra funds will be put toward beginning work on the other two suites shown on the left in the architectural drawing above.</p>
<p>Should we fall short of our full goal, the funds we do raise will help us begin work on our new suite and will not affect our ability to fulfill our perks since we already have two overwater bungalows ready to go. And, after four years building and working in Panama, <strong>we're no strangers to working around challenges</strong>!</p>
<h2>Exclusive Perks for Our Backers</h2>

<p>We have some <strong>stellar perks</strong> to offer to our backers, which we are ready to deliver immediately since we already have two overwater bungalows and an award-winning restaurant in place.</p>

<h3>A Focus on the Environment and Local Community</h3>

<p>We would obviously love your help to achieve our goal of expanding our little creation, <strong>but it's about more than that</strong>! We employ four local chefs and housekeepers and several local tradesmen, and provide income to all of our local boat captains who transport our guests around the islands and on tours.</p>
<p><strong>We promote a living wage</strong> in the community by paying our employees significantly more than the local average. By expanding, we will be able to <strong>create at least six new construction and hospitality/tourism jobs</strong> that offer high wages and opportunities to learn new job skills.</p>
<p>In our local community of Old Bank, unemployment is relatively high, so it would be hard to overestimate the impact those jobs could have for several local families.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527291873/dwc1posuigybfphuvprm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We also work closely with the local government to improve infrastructure and to <strong>promote the protection of our community's natural treasures</strong> by sponsoring local clean-up days, educating our guests about the threats that plastic waste pose to our ecosystem, and limiting waste and the use of plastics in our operation.</p>
<p>We have never sold drinks in plastic bottles or used plastic or styrofoam takeout containers, we were the first business on the island to go <strong>plastic-straw free</strong>, we've consistently managed to stay close to <strong>zero food waste</strong> by shopping carefully and by serving our extra food to locals in need, and we strive to reduce our environmental impact by<strong> salvaging and reusing materials</strong> in building and landscaping.</p>

A lot of people dream of quitting their jobs, moving to a tropical island, and opening their own bed and breakfast, and we did it! While we both had several years of experience in the hospitality industry, we were complete newbies when it came to construction and to operating a business overseas. The learning curve was steep and there were challenges along the way, but we've built two overwater bungalows and founded one of the top-rated restaurants on the island. In the process, we've learned the ins and outs of local construction and of operating a business here in Panama. We now find ourselves in the enviable position of having more demand than we can accommodate, so we're ready to build three new, loft-style overwater suites, starting with the first unit, which you can see on the right in the architectural drawing below. And, because we already have two bungalows, we're ready to start delivering perks to our backers now! Claim your fully-transferable stay with no blackout dates or expiration date at a steep discount, and help us achieve our dream of expanding our creation while helping create at least six new high-paying construction and hospitality jobs in our community! Get yourself a stay at a discounted rate that can be redeemed any time in the future! Our Budget
After working with several local builders and suppliers, we've created a budget of $39,000 for the first of our three new loft-style overwater suites, including labor, materials, furniture, decor, and permits.
Budget breakdown:

Building materials and furniture/decor: $19,840
Labor and permits: $15,000
Chakra bags/postcards/t-shirts/totes and shipping: $1000
Indiegogo's 5% fee on funds raised: $2000
Stripe's 2.9% fee on credit card pledges: $1160

We know from prior experience that project costs can increase over projections due to changes in the availability of materials and fluctuations in material and labor prices, so we are seeking to raise $45,000 to ensure that -- even if unexpected hiccups arise -- we can complete our new bungalow by January of 2019.
If we are lucky enough to come in under budget or to exceed our goal, any extra funds will be put toward beginning work on the other two suites shown on the left in the architectural drawing above.
Should we fall short of our full goal, the funds we do raise will help us begin work on our new suite and will not affect our ability to fulfill our perks since we already have two overwater bungalows ready to go. And, after four years building and working in Panama, we're no strangers to working around challenges!

We would obviously love your help to achieve our goal of expanding our little creation, but it's about more than that! We employ four local chefs and housekeepers and several local tradesmen, and provide income to all of our local boat captains who transport our guests around the islands and on tours.
We promote a living wage in the community by paying our employees significantly more than the local average. By expanding, we will be able to create at least six new construction and hospitality/tourism jobs that offer high wages and opportunities to learn new job skills.

We also work closely with the local government to improve infrastructure and to promote the protection of our community's natural treasures by sponsoring local clean-up days, educating our guests about the threats that plastic waste pose to our ecosystem, and limiting waste and the use of plastics in our operation.
We have never sold drinks in plastic bottles or used plastic or styrofoam takeout containers, we were the first business on the island to go plastic-straw free, we've consistently managed to stay close to zero food waste by shopping carefully and by serving our extra food to locals in need, and we strive to reduce our environmental impact by salvaging and reusing materials in building and landscaping.

By supporting The Sea Monkey, our backers are also supporting the responsible development of the islands of Bocas del Toro and helping support local families and the community of Old Bank as a whole.

Why Back Us?

Unlike a lot of crowdfunding campaigns, we aren't starting from scratch. We've been in operation since June of 2015 and have managed to create a solid reputation for our business online and in our community.
We aren't new to the challenges of building on a remote island in a developing country, either. We've built hundreds of feet of dock, two overwater bungalows, and the foundation platform for our three new suites from scratch.
We have also remodeled a local home from the ground up to create Casa Takalua, our overwater casita, and have founded one of the highest-rated restaurants in the area, which we've been operating since 2015. Both our restaurant and bed and breakfast have consistently earned TripAdvisor's Certificate of Excellence and are recommended by Lonely Planet.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Dionysios Mylonas. I hold an MSc in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, an MBA from the Imperial College, London and a BSc in Chemical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece. My specialization as an engineer is in Fuels' Technology and as a financier in Investment Banking. You may find my detailed bio here: <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dionyssis-mylonas-88051156/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/in/dionyssis-mylonas-88051156/</a></p>
<p>My present campaign is the first start-up I am attempting.  It is based on personal work I have commenced, on a part-time basis since 2009, and on a nearly full-time basis since February 2018 trying to find an accurate method for <strong>measuring horsepower not at the wheels, but at the internal combustion engine's crankshaft or the electric motor's rotor shaft. </strong>The result of this work is two approved patents I hold, namely<strong> GR1008172 </strong>and<strong> GR1009319 </strong>as well as a <strong>US Patent Application </strong>for which I expect first USPTO action in the next months (pls see below sections). Finally, <strong>I have already personally funded</strong> patenting expenses and, most importantly, a fully functional Android working prototype of the mobile app that implements this patenting work, elaborated by the developers' team I have hired. <strong>This project has Arrow Certified Technology, meaning Arrow has reviewed the design and deemed it feasible for manufacturing.</strong></p>
<p>A prospect contributor may think, ""isn't this field, i.e. Automotive Technology, a rather specialized one? Will it have broad appeal?"". The answer is yes, it is indeed specialized, but this is exactly the reason it requires someone qualified for scientifically proven, accurate and reliable results. As detailed in the Impact and FAQ sections below, <strong>the present project will still appeal to no less than 45 million existing users </strong>of competing mobile apps commercially launched, but not based on patents and, imho, giving inaccurate results despite the fact that some are quite expensive. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What The Car Addict Team Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>My detailed budget, as formulated following necessary input by my developers, has as follows:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576874166/pvsg4k5x6bal0lwyd8u1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As one can see, the first two tasks are necessary for the automatization of the horsepower and torque measurement phase. <strong>This phase is fundamentally complete</strong>, as, for example, we have measured crankshaft horsepower of my tuned Audi S3 MKII at 299 +/-1.5% ps. In fact, all measurements were between 295 and 303 ps, of course after (manual, for the time being) correction for the prevailing ambient conditions. I believe it's noteworthy that this horsepower turned out to be slightly higher when I replaced the malfunctioning wastegate valve, as shown in the three related YouTube videos associated with this campaign. It has to be pointed out that two different chassis dynos have tested this Audi S3 at 278 ps and 306 ps, with much lower repeatability (""reliability"" in statistics' jargon). To be fully transparent, the above difference of 28 ps, or 10%, has given me the final push to try to find a more accurate and reliable horsepower measurement method. Above chassis dynos' results are available to anyone interested. Returning to the measurements with our app, we found similar to the Audi S3's tests reliability on tests of cars like the Maserati Gransport that is shown as one of this campaign's card images, as well as on less powerful cars such as a Mazda MX-5 Miata 2.0lt and a Volkswagen E-Golf, owned by friends of mine who volunteered to offer them to me for testing. </p>
<p>The next tasks, as explained from Row 3 and below of the above table, <strong>do not require any mechanical engineering inventiveness, but IT work tasks</strong> of the specific costs outlined above. The most important part, allow me to repeat, is complete and has verified the three (two approved and one pending) patents' claims, as well as certain additional claims that will be filed via a CIP (Continuation In Part) Patent Application upon receipt of first USPTO action. </p>
<p>An important query I believe I have to address, is what will happen to the funds collected if I don't reach my total goal of USD 9,700, calculated in the above listed table. The answer is clear: <strong>such funds will go towards implementing as many tasks of said table as possible</strong>. In other words, I will continue following my goal to launch and commercialize Car Addict, by directing all available funds towards further upgrading this mobile app. I will be available to prove this, by delivering<strong> </strong>the<strong> Current Mobile App featuring Arrow Certified Technology </strong>to any backer who claims it after the end of this campaign, whereas the <strong>Enhanced Mobile App</strong> per above budget and the <strong>Upgraded Mobile App</strong> are currently hidden perks, to be offered at a higher than 50% discount during the course of my campaign. The Upgraded Mobile app will incorporate other performance measurements such as accelerations, as well as certain functions that will enhance ease and safety of its use. Development of <strong>the iOS version of Car Addict </strong>will be the next and final step. </p>
<p>As regards the abovementioned <strong>perks</strong> I, of course, realize that they do not translate to a significant monetary equivalent, but hopefully contributors will find some value in this. However, allow me to stress out at this point that, as beta testing is one of the next steps for which I seek your funding, we will have to be extremely careful as regards the Android smartphone to which the contributor will download the Current Mobile App, as not all accelerometers embedded in such smartphones always give accurate signals; Car Addict is based on such signals to measure horsepower and, in the near future, other car performance figures. </p>
<p>Finally, I will offer my personal acknowledgement in the form of an Electronic Certificate to every single contributor, and if this campaign proves successful I will be more than grateful to see them become members of the Car Addict blog to be formed. </p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This product, i.e. the mobile app I have named Car Addict, appeals to a specific target market: car enthusiasts. It does not appeal to the family man who drives a  Honda Odyssey or to the housewife who drives a Toyota Camry. <strong>So, is the audience for such a product large enough? The answer is definitely yes.</strong> By the end of 2013, according to published data (<a href=""http://www.prioridata.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.prioridata.com</a>), there were already 8.9 million active users of only iOS mobile apps competitive to Car Addict. Assuming that the ratio of Android/ iOS users of such apps was then proportional to the ratio of Android/ iOS users for all apps (i.e. 1.95x), this leads to a total number of 26.3 million users of relevant apps as of 2013 year end. The Compounded Annual Growth Rate, CAGR of global expense for mobile apps is estimated at 19.2% yoy for the period 2016-2023 (<a href=""https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports/ALLI-Auto-3C188/mobile-application-market?gclid=Cj0KCQiAjfvwBRCkARIsAIqSWlPGPEwQj2_zNE0T8fTbTiD7pIK9RUhcBBfLYnRs-uaS1y5VHIJl9JgaAuhTEALw_wcB"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports/ALL...</a><a href=""https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwif9p73qYbnAhWG4VEKHW-rAsAYABAFGgJ3cw&amp;ohost=www.google.gr&amp;cid=CAESQOD2KmNYqJ595IKYKVUNPrYoIsLcqe0f3YROkjX35NM7zyCEAPSSsLO2-v4nmmds2JfWFBhz7HgKS_jJwX97Vas&amp;sig=AOD64_3gUXmZR7IcwQAf6X7z_kfJ9mI-Kw&amp;q=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-2pP3qYbnAhXi8eAKHQa8C-UQ0Qx6BAgNEAE&amp;adurl=https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa...</a>). Assuming, for conservatism purposes, a significantly lower CAGR of 10% for mobile apps of the Car Addict category, we end up to a projected figure of <strong>46.6 million active users by 2019 year end, i.e. practically now</strong>. I, nevertheless, strongly believe that the figure is much higher than the above, as Android users are currently 7 times as many as iOS ones. </p>
<p>Therefore, this product is a specialized one, but still the audience and the relative need are substantial, to say the least. Users of such apps tend to buy more than one in order to compare the one against the other. Key market is the US and especially SoCal, where it is rumored that about half of the world's supercars are located. Indeed, car enthusiasts love to measure their car performance and power frequently, e.g. before and after service checks, or before and after tuning, in order to share and compare their results with fellow car enthusiasts. Responding to this need, there exist thousands of  mobile apps broadly related to cars, as well as numerous YouTube channels addressed to the car addict. </p>
<p>One might definitely ask, ""There exist chassis dynos, as they are called, costing dozens of thousands of dolars, since decades ago. What are, therefore, the benefits of a cheap mobile app measuring horsepower, as compared to this costly equipment?"". Apart from what I have written in the previous section, the three major advantages of Car Addict are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Convenience: </strong>You can measure horsepower with  Car Addict as you drive, using your chosen gear and your desired speed range (start and finish). There is no need to book an appointment at a dyno center in advance and spend half a day. It is, nevertheless, strongly recommended that use of Car Addict,  <strong><i>if</i></strong> <i>it is</i> <i>at high (illegal) speeds,</i> be made in tracks/ circuits built for this purpose. </li>
<li>
<strong>Cost:</strong> Dyno center costs vary from $70-100 per measurement, whereas Car Addict can be downloaded at an est. $4.95 and used infinitely. For rough comparison purposes, the two most expensive competitive current Android apps are priced at 27.99 and 12.99 euros. </li>
<li>
<strong>Reliability and Accuracy:</strong> Car Addict helps avoid engine fatigue and overheating that are usual in dyno measurements. The main reason for this fatigue is that chassis dynos exert a much greater resistance to the rolling of car's wheels than the resistance encountered in real road conditions, i.e. on the asphalt concrete. I have seen a car engine of mine switching to ""safe mode"" during a dyno run due to the intervention of the Engine Control Unit, ECU in order to protect the engine. I have witnessed a supercar's engine (I cannot reveal the brand, for obvious reasons) burst during a dyno run and I have also seen a similar video on YouTube. </li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, Car Addict is a more convenient, inexpensive, reliable and accurate alternative to traditional chassis dynos and competitive mobile apps. For more info on comparison with competing apps, pls read the following section.</p>
<p>And, it goes without saying, if you still don't trust me, I believe that the first paragraphs of the next section will appease your concerns.</p>

<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>It is important for a prospect contributor to know who the creator of this project is and what qualifies him to undertake it. As noted above, I am a <strong>Chemical Engineer MSc (UCLA), and my specialization is in Fuels' Technology</strong>. The reason I took this specialization is simply that I am a car addict myself, so I tried to combine my hobby with my studies. My Bachelor's project at the National Technical University of Athens was a combination of Organic Chemistry and Automotive Engineering: I was developing new gasoline/ petrol additives and testing them on a standard engine with variable compression ratio: the well known CFR engine. Subsequently, my Master's thesis at UCLA was dealing with specific aspects of pollution in the LA basin, which was mainly caused by, what else, automobiles. My thesis was briefly presented as a paper published in one of the major scientific journals in the field, namely <i>Atmospheric Environment</i>:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/096016869190211O"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/096016869190211O</a> </p>
<p>I have also worked as an Associate Researcher for the Fuels and Lubricants Laboratory of the National Technical University of Athens. I participated in a project of utmost importance for the Greek State's Fuel Policy: a cost-benefit project for the separation of Diesel Fuel in Greece in two types, heating and motor. Project's recommendations were immediately implemented by the Government and since then Diesel fuel consumed in Greece is separated in the above two types, making the country, allow me to say, a more ""modern"" one to this respect.</p>
<p>Finally, although I followed for many years a banker's career, capitalizing on my MBA from the Imperial College (after all, we do many things in our lives just for money!), I never stopped researching and keeping up with all developments in the automotive field. I therefore developed two Greek patents, GR1008172 and GR1009319 and filed for a US Patent Application, of which the first page is shown below (I have erased some details for confidentiality purposes, as the patent application is published but first USPTO office action is pending): </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564325434/sgaqqdhybqax1nlgtpkd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>In addition, the fully functional Android working prototype of Car Addict has Arrow Certified Technology as of September 13, 2019.</strong> </p>
<p>As said above, the patents on which this project is based have been already tested, quite extensively I dare to say, on various automobiles, as <strong>the major risk of this project is competition</strong>: there already exist on app stores thousands of mobile apps broadly related to cars: speedometers, lap timers, apps for driving assistance, for taxi booking, car trivia etc, as well as quite a few apps that measure performance and power like Car Addict. However, and to the best of my knowledge,  none of the apps belonging to the last category is based on patents or is featuring certified technology (and I have searched, downloaded and used a lot of them myself) .</p>
<p>In addition, they all do the same thing: they measure horsepower not at the crankshaft, but at the wheels. Then, in order to calculate horsepower at the crankshaft they assume a certain percentage of transmission loss, which is to a large extent arbitrary, and add it to the measured wheel horsepower. Why do I characterize this assumed percentage as ""arbitrary""? To give you a striking example, the two most expensive current Android apps, one priced at 27.99 and the other at  12.99 euros as priorly mentioned, assume that these losses are 9.9% and 17.6% respectively of the crankshaft power of my Audi S3 MKII, an all-wheel-drive car; a difference of 7.7%. Another app assumes a 14% loss for all manual transmission cars, where there exist powerful front-wheel-drive manual gearbox cars with only 5% transmission losses, such as the older European spec Ford Focus developing 305 ps (301 bhp), the Honda Civic Type-R of 310 ps (306 bhp), etc. <strong>Car Addict is based on a totally different mechanical engineering approach</strong>, whereby powertrain losses, which include engine and/or electric motor(s) and transmission ones, are measured; it does not simply assume a transmission loss percentage as competition does. Therefore, the expected accuracy is within +/- 2% of the real (i.e., measured by the car manufacturer's bench test) horsepower. Car Addict will not give the user a 14% transmission loss when it is only 5%, i.e. a 9% deviation; it will measure this transmission loss with the above quoted accuracy of 2%.</p>
<p>Apart from the above decisive competitive advantage, <strong>Car Addict is suitable for the horsepower measurement of electric and hybrid cars</strong>, for which regenerative braking can be disabled. Some competitors are developing their codes for being able to measure electric and hybrid cars, but Car Addict is ready to use relative proprietary formulas. In addition, the patented electromechanical engineering method applied <strong>unburdens the user of the need to know and enter from the menu a number of parameters</strong> such as aerodynamic drag coefficient, frontal area, rolling friction coefficient/ tyres' size, exact engine displacement, gear/ differential ratios, transmission and gearbox type etc. Only car weight and speed per 1,000 rpm are needed -the latter only if you want to plot horsepower and torque Vs rpm-, and if not known, the Enhanced Mobile App will help the user find them. </p>
<p>Finally,  <strong>Car Addict, has a number of additional advantages</strong>. Unlike other applications, it does not require calibration. The user only needs to mount her/ his smartphone on the windscreen and verify that the acceleration values along the three axes are right, as given by numerous free apps, some offered with the smartphone per se. Again, unlike other applications, it does not require to start measurements from a complete stop, provided that the user has entered in advance the correct inputs and has not exceeded the start speed. Lastly, the car performance and safety of use functions offered will be numerous, but cannot be revealed at this stage, for reasons related to competition.</p>
<p>Another challenge I am facing with this project is <strong>market positioning</strong>. I did my best as regards this aspect also; although my specialization as an MBA holder and banker is Investment Banking/ Structured Finance, I do have some marketing knowledge and quite some relevant experience, dealing with large corporate clients since 1996 (you may wish to see my LinkedIn profile on this point). Furthermore, I have completed an initial marketing survey through <i>SurveyMonkey</i>, testing the waters with respect to the idea, the pricing, the pros and the cons, etc. The cons were addressed during the development of Car Addict. This initial survey indicated that 31 out of 40 people who took the time to respond found the idea to be ""interesting"" to ""great"" to ""awesome"". Survey's results are available, on a confidential basis, to prospect contributors.

<p>I know what I wrote above, ""this is the most interesting project I have ever run"" sounds trite, but it is true. It is the only project I have created 100% on my own, driven by personal need and curiosity. Usually, modern day projects are run by companies or organizations and, as such,  they are run by many qualified people; I have participated in quite a few, some already mentioned above, in both my engineering and banking career. So, this one is what Americans call ""my baby"", as I have devoted endless hours to its development, especially since February 2018, on both my laptop desk and the field testing various versions of Car Addict on different cars. Therefore, I would be grateful, even if you cannot contribute in monetary terms, if you spread out my campaign by your word of mouth or through the social media you are in.

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Dionysios Mylonas. I hold an MSc in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, an MBA from the Imperial College, London and a BSc in Chemical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece. My specialization as an engineer is in Fuels' Technology and as a financier in Investment Banking. You may find my detailed bio here: http://www.linkedin.com/in/dionyssis-mylonas-88051156/
My present campaign is the first start-up I am attempting.  It is based on personal work I have commenced, on a part-time basis since 2009, and on a nearly full-time basis since February 2018 trying to find an accurate method for measuring horsepower not at the wheels, but at the internal combustion engine's crankshaft or the electric motor's rotor shaft. The result of this work is two approved patents I hold, namely GR1008172 and GR1009319 as well as a US Patent Application for which I expect first USPTO action in the next months (pls see below sections). Finally, I have already personally funded patenting expenses and, most importantly, a fully functional Android working prototype of the mobile app that implements this patenting work, elaborated by the developers' team I have hired. This project has Arrow Certified Technology, meaning Arrow has reviewed the design and deemed it feasible for manufacturing.
A prospect contributor may think, ""isn't this field, i.e. Automotive Technology, a rather specialized one? Will it have broad appeal?"". The answer is yes, it is indeed specialized, but this is exactly the reason it requires someone qualified for scientifically proven, accurate and reliable results. As detailed in the Impact and FAQ sections below, the present project will still appeal to no less than 45 million existing users of competing mobile apps commercially launched, but not based on patents and, imho, giving inaccurate results despite the fact that some are quite expensive. 
 

What The Car Addict Team Need & What You Get
My detailed budget, as formulated following necessary input by my developers, has as follows:

As one can see, the first two tasks are necessary for the automatization of the horsepower and torque measurement phase. This phase is fundamentally complete, as, for example, we have measured crankshaft horsepower of my tuned Audi S3 MKII at 299 +/-1.5% ps. In fact, all measurements were between 295 and 303 ps, of course after (manual, for the time being) correction for the prevailing ambient conditions. I believe it's noteworthy that this horsepower turned out to be slightly higher when I replaced the malfunctioning wastegate valve, as shown in the three related YouTube videos associated with this campaign. It has to be pointed out that two different chassis dynos have tested this Audi S3 at 278 ps and 306 ps, with much lower repeatability (""reliability"" in statistics' jargon). To be fully transparent, the above difference of 28 ps, or 10%, has given me the final push to try to find a more accurate and reliable horsepower measurement method. Above chassis dynos' results are available to anyone interested. Returning to the measurements with our app, we found similar to the Audi S3's tests reliability on tests of cars like the Maserati Gransport that is shown as one of this campaign's card images, as well as on less powerful cars such as a Mazda MX-5 Miata 2.0lt and a Volkswagen E-Golf, owned by friends of mine who volunteered to offer them to me for testing. 
The next tasks, as explained from Row 3 and below of the above table, do not require any mechanical engineering inventiveness, but IT work tasks of the specific costs outlined above. The most important part, allow me to repeat, is complete and has verified the three (two approved and one pending) patents' claims, as well as certain additional claims that will be filed via a CIP (Continuation In Part) Patent Application upon receipt of first USPTO action. 
An important query I believe I have to address, is what will happen to the funds collected if I don't reach my total goal of USD 9,700, calculated in the above listed table. The answer is clear: such funds will go towards implementing as many tasks of said table as possible. In other words, I will continue following my goal to launch and commercialize Car Addict, by directing all available funds towards further upgrading this mobile app. I will be available to prove this, by delivering the Current Mobile App featuring Arrow Certified Technology to any backer who claims it after the end of this campaign, whereas the Enhanced Mobile App per above budget and the Upgraded Mobile App are currently hidden perks, to be offered at a higher than 50% discount during the course of my campaign. The Upgraded Mobile app will incorporate other performance measurements such as accelerations, as well as certain functions that will enhance ease and safety of its use. Development of the iOS version of Car Addict will be the next and final step. 
As regards the abovementioned perks I, of course, realize that they do not translate to a significant monetary equivalent, but hopefully contributors will find some value in this. However, allow me to stress out at this point that, as beta testing is one of the next steps for which I seek your funding, we will have to be extremely careful as regards the Android smartphone to which the contributor will download the Current Mobile App, as not all accelerometers embedded in such smartphones always give accurate signals; Car Addict is based on such signals to measure horsepower and, in the near future, other car performance figures. 
Finally, I will offer my personal acknowledgement in the form of an Electronic Certificate to every single contributor, and if this campaign proves successful I will be more than grateful to see them become members of the Car Addict blog to be formed. 
 

The Impact
This product, i.e. the mobile app I have named Car Addict, appeals to a specific target market: car enthusiasts. It does not appeal to the family man who drives a  Honda Odyssey or to the housewife who drives a Toyota Camry. So, is the audience for such a product large enough? The answer is definitely yes. By the end of 2013, according to published data (www.prioridata.com), there were already 8.9 million active users of only iOS mobile apps competitive to Car Addict. Assuming that the ratio of Android/ iOS users of such apps was then proportional to the ratio of Android/ iOS users for all apps (i.e. 1.95x), this leads to a total number of 26.3 million users of relevant apps as of 2013 year end. The Compounded Annual Growth Rate, CAGR of global expense for mobile apps is estimated at 19.2% yoy for the period 2016-2023 (https://reports.valuates.com/market-reports/ALL...https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa...). Assuming, for conservatism purposes, a significantly lower CAGR of 10% for mobile apps of the Car Addict category, we end up to a projected figure of 46.6 million active users by 2019 year end, i.e. practically now. I, nevertheless, strongly believe that the figure is much higher than the above, as Android users are currently 7 times as many as iOS ones. 
Therefore, this product is a specialized one, but still the audience and the relative need are substantial, to say the least. Users of such apps tend to buy more than one in order to compare the one against the other. Key market is the US and especially SoCal, where it is rumored that about half of the world's supercars are located. Indeed, car enthusiasts love to measure their car performance and power frequently, e.g. before and after service checks, or before and after tuning, in order to share and compare their results with fellow car enthusiasts. Responding to this need, there exist thousands of  mobile apps broadly related to cars, as well as numerous YouTube channels addressed to the car addict. 
One might definitely ask, ""There exist chassis dynos, as they are called, costing dozens of thousands of dolars, since decades ago. What are, therefore, the benefits of a cheap mobile app measuring horsepower, as compared to this costly equipment?"". Apart from what I have written in the previous section, the three major advantages of Car Addict are:


Convenience: You can measure horsepower with  Car Addict as you drive, using your chosen gear and your desired speed range (start and finish). There is no need to book an appointment at a dyno center in advance and spend half a day. It is, nevertheless, strongly recommended that use of Car Addict,  if it is at high (illegal) speeds, be made in tracks/ circuits built for this purpose. 

Cost: Dyno center costs vary from $70-100 per measurement, whereas Car Addict can be downloaded at an est. $4.95 and used infinitely. For rough comparison purposes, the two most expensive competitive current Android apps are priced at 27.99 and 12.99 euros. 

Reliability and Accuracy: Car Addict helps avoid engine fatigue and overheating that are usual in dyno measurements. The main reason for this fatigue is that chassis dynos exert a much greater resistance to the rolling of car's wheels than the resistance encountered in real road conditions, i.e. on the asphalt concrete. I have seen a car engine of mine switching to ""safe mode"" during a dyno run due to the intervention of the Engine Control Unit, ECU in order to protect the engine. I have witnessed a supercar's engine (I cannot reveal the brand, for obvious reasons) burst during a dyno run and I have also seen a similar video on YouTube. 

Therefore, Car Addict is a more convenient, inexpensive, reliable and accurate alternative to traditional chassis dynos and competitive mobile apps. For more info on comparison with competing apps, pls read the following section.
And, it goes without saying, if you still don't trust me, I believe that the first paragraphs of the next section will appease your concerns.
 

Risks & Challenges
It is important for a prospect contributor to know who the creator of this project is and what qualifies him to undertake it. As noted above, I am a Chemical Engineer MSc (UCLA), and my specialization is in Fuels' Technology. The reason I took this specialization is simply that I am a car addict myself, so I tried to combine my hobby with my studies. My Bachelor's project at the National Technical University of Athens was a combination of Organic Chemistry and Automotive Engineering: I was developing new gasoline/ petrol additives and testing them on a standard engine with variable compression ratio: the well known CFR engine. Subsequently, my Master's thesis at UCLA was dealing with specific aspects of pollution in the LA basin, which was mainly caused by, what else, automobiles. My thesis was briefly presented as a paper published in one of the major scientific journals in the field, namely Atmospheric Environment:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/096016869190211O 
I have also worked as an Associate Researcher for the Fuels and Lubricants Laboratory of the National Technical University of Athens. I participated in a project of utmost importance for the Greek State's Fuel Policy: a cost-benefit project for the separation of Diesel Fuel in Greece in two types, heating and motor. Project's recommendations were immediately implemented by the Government and since then Diesel fuel consumed in Greece is separated in the above two types, making the country, allow me to say, a more ""modern"" one to this respect.
Finally, although I followed for many years a banker's career, capitalizing on my MBA from the Imperial College (after all, we do many things in our lives just for money!), I never stopped researching and keeping up with all developments in the automotive field. I therefore developed two Greek patents, GR1008172 and GR1009319 and filed for a US Patent Application, of which the first page is shown below (I have erased some details for confidentiality purposes, as the patent application is published but first USPTO office action is pending): 
 

In addition, the fully functional Android working prototype of Car Addict has Arrow Certified Technology as of September 13, 2019. 
As said above, the patents on which this project is based have been already tested, quite extensively I dare to say, on various automobiles, as the major risk of this project is competition: there already exist on app stores thousands of mobile apps broadly related to cars: speedometers, lap timers, apps for driving assistance, for taxi booking, car trivia etc, as well as quite a few apps that measure performance and power like Car Addict. However, and to the best of my knowledge,  none of the apps belonging to the last category is based on patents or is featuring certified technology (and I have searched, downloaded and used a lot of them myself) .
In addition, they all do the same thing: they measure horsepower not at the crankshaft, but at the wheels. Then, in order to calculate horsepower at the crankshaft they assume a certain percentage of transmission loss, which is to a large extent arbitrary, and add it to the measured wheel horsepower. Why do I characterize this assumed percentage as ""arbitrary""? To give you a striking example, the two most expensive current Android apps, one priced at 27.99 and the other at  12.99 euros as priorly mentioned, assume that these losses are 9.9% and 17.6% respectively of the crankshaft power of my Audi S3 MKII, an all-wheel-drive car; a difference of 7.7%. Another app assumes a 14% loss for all manual transmission cars, where there exist powerful front-wheel-drive manual gearbox cars with only 5% transmission losses, such as the older European spec Ford Focus developing 305 ps (301 bhp), the Honda Civic Type-R of 310 ps (306 bhp), etc. Car Addict is based on a totally different mechanical engineering approach, whereby powertrain losses, which include engine and/or electric motor(s) and transmission ones, are measured; it does not simply assume a transmission loss percentage as competition does. Therefore, the expected accuracy is within +/- 2% of the real (i.e., measured by the car manufacturer's bench test) horsepower. Car Addict will not give the user a 14% transmission loss when it is only 5%, i.e. a 9% deviation; it will measure this transmission loss with the above quoted accuracy of 2%.
Apart from the above decisive competitive advantage, Car Addict is suitable for the horsepower measurement of electric and hybrid cars, for which regenerative braking can be disabled. Some competitors are developing their codes for being able to measure electric and hybrid cars, but Car Addict is ready to use relative proprietary formulas. In addition, the patented electromechanical engineering method applied unburdens the user of the need to know and enter from the menu a number of parameters such as aerodynamic drag coefficient, frontal area, rolling friction coefficient/ tyres' size, exact engine displacement, gear/ differential ratios, transmission and gearbox type etc. Only car weight and speed per 1,000 rpm are needed -the latter only if you want to plot horsepower and torque Vs rpm-, and if not known, the Enhanced Mobile App will help the user find them. 
Finally,  Car Addict, has a number of additional advantages. Unlike other applications, it does not require calibration. The user only needs to mount her/ his smartphone on the windscreen and verify that the acceleration values along the three axes are right, as given by numerous free apps, some offered with the smartphone per se. Again, unlike other applications, it does not require to start measurements from a complete stop, provided that the user has entered in advance the correct inputs and has not exceeded the start speed. Lastly, the car performance and safety of use functions offered will be numerous, but cannot be revealed at this stage, for reasons related to competition.
Another challenge I am facing with this project is market positioning. I did my best as regards this aspect also; although my specialization as an MBA holder and banker is Investment Banking/ Structured Finance, I do have some marketing knowledge and quite some relevant experience, dealing with large corporate clients since 1996 (you may wish to see my LinkedIn profile on this point). Furthermore, I have completed an initial marketing survey through SurveyMonkey, testing the waters with respect to the idea, the pricing, the pros and the cons, etc. The cons were addressed during the development of Car Addict. This initial survey indicated that 31 out of 40 people who took the time to respond found the idea to be ""interesting"" to ""great"" to ""awesome"". Survey's results are available, on a confidential basis, to prospect contributors. Therefore, I believe that the marketing elements of this project have been satisfactorily addressed and I am proceeding safely. 
A last challenge is time, as competition may offer new features - the underlying engineering method is legally risk free to this respect, as it is secured by the approved patents as well as the filing date of the pending one. I would like to stress the fact that my IT team consists of three qualified developers, all Computer Science graduates - one of them is following his graduate studies concurrently with this project. As one of these three team members has recently moved to London to pursue more lucrative professional opportunities, I will hire two additional ones, if I secure funding, to expedite the procedure. Therefore we will do our best to complete the additional app features the soonest possible in order to be ahead of the competition.

<h3><strong>Concept of Operations</strong></h3>
<p><strong>(HOW)</strong></p>
<p>You already live within a 3-4hr car ride of awesome adventure areas! We are experience focused, not location locked.</p>
<p>The SOF Adventure approach saves the expense of an airline ticket and time of travel days by choosing an outdoor location near you. This means, no need to build 2 days of air travel and the related cost, stress and hassle into your itinerary. We'll maximize your vacation time spent on actual vacation, not travel to it.</p>
<p>SOF Adventures brings everything required to complete the task. Just bring the right attire (we'll help here, as required). No investment in gear. You get to test drive our stuff that we chose because it worked in the Special Operations Community.</p>
<p><strong>Force Multiply!</strong></p>
<p>A Force Multiplier, simply put, makes more. We've trained Foreign Forces to recruit teammates or tell a buddy. One becomes two, two becomes six. Wet the gremlin, feed 'em after midnight, instant party!</p>
<p>Be a Force Multiplier and share with 5-12 like-minded teammates who want SOF Adventures to bring the adventure.</p>
<p><strong>(WHEN)</strong></p>
<p>Once you've formed a team of at least 6 and have dates in mind contact us for availability. We'll identify a viable location, get your team booked and relay additional details in a trip package.</p>
<p><strong>(WHERE)</strong></p>
<p>ALL bookings for the 2020/21 season will be run in the extended US Mid-Atlantic Region, PA, DE, MA, NY, MD, VA, NC, CT AND RI.</p>
<p>Visit us at  <a href=""http://sofadventures.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sofadventures.com</a> for details, trip booking and to review all terms, conditions and policies.</p>

<p><strong>(WHY)</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Limitations Preventing Potential Adventure Seekers:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The PROBLEM:</strong></p>
<p>Through trips with family, friends and a few soft openings we found that many did not take the first step to outdoor adventure primarily due to a few limiting factors outlined here. When the opportunity was presented to get outdoors, with limited risk and overhead equipment expense, all surveyed could not wait to do it again.</p>
<p><strong>We fear what we don't understand.</strong></p>
<p>This is generally a lack of Knowledge, Skill and Ability (KSA). KSA is a common term used to check understanding for Courses of Instruction within the Special Operations community. Basically, subject matter <i>Knowledge</i> is relayed. <i>Skill</i>  is demonstrated by the participant. <i>Ability </i> is confirmed through practical exercises. Just going camping takes quite a bit of logistical management.</p>
<p><strong>Location, Location, Location</strong></p>
<p>Where do I go? This is not your typical KOA campground outing. We've found awesome private locations, often bordering 1000's of open to the public acres that allow exclusive camping options with access to incredible recreational areas.  You already live within a 3-4hr ride of these areas.   For your planning purposes SOF Adventures saves the expense of an airline ticket and travel days by selecting a viable adventure site near you.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong></p>
<p>The expense of purchasing the right expensive tents, sleeping bags and pads, backpacks, food prep equipment, etc.., is a huge leap for beginners. Why would you invest in this endeavor if you aren't certain it is for you? When coupled with the KSA barrier this can be a non-starter for most.   We'll help you find the way...</p>

<p><strong>Our SOLUTION:</strong></p>
<p>A diverse team of highly skilled Veterans share our cumulative <i>Knowledge</i>  of outdoor recreation activities.</p>
<p>We will refine your <i>Skills</i>, sharing best practices of Special Operation Teams applied to your group's outing. </p>
<p>Your<i> Ability</i>  will be challenged with practical exercises in the field related to the focus of your desired course of instruction. You will leave with the confidence to apply your new abilities to plan and manage your own outdoor adventures.</p>
<p>SOF Adventures applies a crawl, walk, run approach to our instruction. Allowing you to progress at the team's relative pace. Our customizable packages allow for return trips with adventures of increasing levels of difficulty. </p>
<p>SOF Adventures isn't a traditional guide service. From mission planning to trip execution, we'll teach you to do it alone. We bring all the gear required, no experience necessary, no risk of commitment to the expense of gear, if outdoor adventure turns out not to be your thing.</p>
<h3><strong>Campaign Impact</strong></h3>
<p>SOF Adventures will force multiply good stewards of the environment, foster no impact/no trace recreational outdoor activities and enable more people to enjoy these activities in their immediate area. Our concept eliminates the need for airline tickets and travel time. We suspect it will be car pool friendly, since we bring all the required equipment. These factors will help limit impact on the environment you are about to explore.</p>
<p>With the current COVID -19, enhanced outdoor activity may become a safe replacement for typical vacation travel. We hope to offer exciting options to traditional vacation travel.</p>
<p>SOF Adventures is Veteran staffed/operated and a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business. We take pride in offering the best qualified cadre who have made careers of dedication to service.</p>

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Be a Force Multiplier, spread the word! Form your team quickly. There will be limited availability for these exclusive outings. Booking at <a href=""http://sofadventures.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sofadventures.com</a> as soon as possible ensures your trip makes it on the calendar.</p>
<p>Our largest obstacle, aside from the one below, is the cost for initial procurement of the equipment load-out. This campaign will allow for rapid procurement of the outstanding items. We'll still get it done if these goals are not fully met but the process will be more complicated without your support.</p>
<p><strong>COVID-19</strong></p>

(WHO)
SOF Adventures is a Veteran owned and enabled adventure guide service.
SOF Adventures was created with two objectives in mind. First, supporting Special Operation Forces (SOF) and other Veterans with value added employment that translates our cumulative experiences to meaningful outdoor opportunities for others. Secondly, encouraging others to get outside, disconnect and explore their nearby parks, recreational areas and environment.
​You may currently be reconsidering the trip to Wally World amusement park, that high population density cruise or other traditional vacations. SOF Adventures is standing by with options to disconnect and get outdoors.
We offer adventures similar to a certain British TV adventure personality without the prerequisite of being a Hollywood A-list celebrity.

 
COI Examples:

Concept of Operations
(HOW)
You already live within a 3-4hr car ride of awesome adventure areas! We are experience focused, not location locked.
The SOF Adventure approach saves the expense of an airline ticket and time of travel days by choosing an outdoor location near you. This means, no need to build 2 days of air travel and the related cost, stress and hassle into your itinerary. We'll maximize your vacation time spent on actual vacation, not travel to it.
SOF Adventures brings everything required to complete the task. Just bring the right attire (we'll help here, as required). No investment in gear. You get to test drive our stuff that we chose because it worked in the Special Operations Community.
Force Multiply!
A Force Multiplier, simply put, makes more. We've trained Foreign Forces to recruit teammates or tell a buddy. One becomes two, two becomes six. Wet the gremlin, feed 'em after midnight, instant party!
Be a Force Multiplier and share with 5-12 like-minded teammates who want SOF Adventures to bring the adventure.
(WHEN)
Once you've formed a team of at least 6 and have dates in mind contact us for availability. We'll identify a viable location, get your team booked and relay additional details in a trip package.
(WHERE)
ALL bookings for the 2020/21 season will be run in the extended US Mid-Atlantic Region, PA, DE, MA, NY, MD, VA, NC, CT AND RI.
Visit us at  sofadventures.com for details, trip booking and to review all terms, conditions and policies.

(WHY)
Limitations Preventing Potential Adventure Seekers:
The PROBLEM:
Through trips with family, friends and a few soft openings we found that many did not take the first step to outdoor adventure primarily due to a few limiting factors outlined here. When the opportunity was presented to get outdoors, with limited risk and overhead equipment expense, all surveyed could not wait to do it again.
We fear what we don't understand.
This is generally a lack of Knowledge, Skill and Ability (KSA). KSA is a common term used to check understanding for Courses of Instruction within the Special Operations community. Basically, subject matter Knowledge is relayed. Skill  is demonstrated by the participant. Ability  is confirmed through practical exercises. Just going camping takes quite a bit of logistical management.
Location, Location, Location
Where do I go? This is not your typical KOA campground outing. We've found awesome private locations, often bordering 1000's of open to the public acres that allow exclusive camping options with access to incredible recreational areas.  You already live within a 3-4hr ride of these areas.   For your planning purposes SOF Adventures saves the expense of an airline ticket and travel days by selecting a viable adventure site near you.
Equipment
The expense of purchasing the right expensive tents, sleeping bags and pads, backpacks, food prep equipment, etc.., is a huge leap for beginners. Why would you invest in this endeavor if you aren't certain it is for you? When coupled with the KSA barrier this can be a non-starter for most.   We'll help you find the way...

Our SOLUTION:
A diverse team of highly skilled Veterans share our cumulative Knowledge  of outdoor recreation activities.
We will refine your Skills, sharing best practices of Special Operation Teams applied to your group's outing. 
Your Ability  will be challenged with practical exercises in the field related to the focus of your desired course of instruction. You will leave with the confidence to apply your new abilities to plan and manage your own outdoor adventures.
SOF Adventures applies a crawl, walk, run approach to our instruction. Allowing you to progress at the team's relative pace. Our customizable packages allow for return trips with adventures of increasing levels of difficulty. 
SOF Adventures isn't a traditional guide service. From mission planning to trip execution, we'll teach you to do it alone. We bring all the gear required, no experience necessary, no risk of commitment to the expense of gear, if outdoor adventure turns out not to be your thing.
Campaign Impact
SOF Adventures will force multiply good stewards of the environment, foster no impact/no trace recreational outdoor activities and enable more people to enjoy these activities in their immediate area. Our concept eliminates the need for airline tickets and travel time. We suspect it will be car pool friendly, since we bring all the required equipment. These factors will help limit impact on the environment you are about to explore.
With the current COVID -19, enhanced outdoor activity may become a safe replacement for typical vacation travel. We hope to offer exciting options to traditional vacation travel.
SOF Adventures is Veteran staffed/operated and a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business. We take pride in offering the best qualified cadre who have made careers of dedication to service.
We suspect this chapter will be more fun for ALL involved!
Contributions 
Your contributions will help offset SOF Adventures' startup costs related to licensing, marketing, insurance, legal fees, website build, program development and initial equipment procurement.
Contribute on the ""BACK IT"" button at the top of the page. SWAG and Perks can also be accessed via this button.
For the 10% off A 3-Day Baseline Voucher you must be on the original CSV email and list of contributors. This is for a single person discount, not an entire group, unless all the group members meet these two requirements. Remember, SOF Adventures requires a minimum of 6 people for our team to build and execute your adventure. If your team members did not meet these two requirements we'll assist you in making fun of them over the course of the trip. 
Perks
Perks listed will be shipped ASAP, currently expecting NLT the end of November 2020. We'll update here if that changes but we know the outfit (quadpromo.com) that does this for the SEAL Teams.
New Perks will be added to unlock and will include discounted trip coupons, surprise limited release survival related items and more SWAG.

Risks & Challenges
Be a Force Multiplier, spread the word! Form your team quickly. There will be limited availability for these exclusive outings. Booking at sofadventures.com as soon as possible ensures your trip makes it on the calendar.
Our largest obstacle, aside from the one below, is the cost for initial procurement of the equipment load-out. This campaign will allow for rapid procurement of the outstanding items. We'll still get it done if these goals are not fully met but the process will be more complicated without your support.
COVID-19
We also suffered some setbacks here, delayed start and waiting for reopening of related service providers.
SOF Adventures takes the COVID-19 outbreak seriously. We'll mitigate risk of exposure through use of masks and buffs (perk coming soon) as required, social distancing as applicable for outdoor activity and the best sanitary practices to disinfect hands and equipment.

<p>After a long development phase involving designers, engineers, and technicians the round 28 mm version of the Clever Caps is completely ready to go to market.</p>
<p>It works perfectly as a:</p>
<p>- cap (threading, sealing and how the seal works)</p>
<p>- building block (they can be assembled with each other and are compatible with Lego blocks)</p>
<p>The cap has already been certified as a toy by the INMETRO (National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology – the Brazilian certification agency). It is therefore approved<b> </b>for marketing.</p>
<p>The pilot/development mold is validated for the production of caps in low volumes. Several tests have been performed, and scaling up will be a question of investment in the acquisition bigger molds.</p>

<p>Our first goal is to manufacture industrial scale molds of the 3 Clever Cap models already developed so production scale can be achieved.</p>
<p>We will then invest in expanding the concept of Clever Caps to other market segments and other kinds of packaging.</p>We believe that with sales growth we will be able to increase our production scale and to advertise globalize the product, so products using Clever Caps can be seen in various countries.<br/>

<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>- Why do we need to invest in bigger molds, if we already have molds?</b></p>
<p>Right now, we have a single cavity mold, which makes just one cap per injection cycle. This is OK for samples or even for a first subsidized pilot launch. However, in order to reach a virtuous cycle of growth, we need bigger molds with much more cavities which will allow us both lower production cost and increase manufacture scale.</p>
<p><b>- Where will the caps be made?</b></p>
<p>Clever Caps will be made either in Brazil or in the United States.</p>
<p><b>- Why the shipping cost is so high?</b></p>
<p>Sending goods overseas from Brazil is quite expensive. We are looking for ways to lower shipping costs. If we succeed (and we hope we will) we will share the savings with our contributors by sending additional of caps.</p>
<p><b>- How long will
it take to get Clever Caps to shelves?</b></p>
<p>The first commercial
product to be marketed with Clever Caps will be a Brazilian local brand mineral
water. For this forthcoming low scale pilot launch, Clever Caps will be
manufactured with the pilot mold. </p>
<p>The level of success in this Crowd
Funding project will have an important impact on the speed of marketing and
expansion of the Clever Caps. That means
that each contribution will help us bring the new caps to market with the goal
of practical expansion of this sustainability concept.</p>
<p><b>- Why are
Clever Caps sustainable?</b></p>
<p>They are sustainable because they
meet the 3 criteria of a sustainable product:</p>
<p><b>· They are
environmentally correct:</b></p>
<p>Clever Caps leave a smaller
environmental footprint because they will be directly reused, i.e., they do not
require any industrial processing.</p>
<p>Since the caps will be reused there
is less garbage in the streets, ocean, beaches, etc.</p>
<p><b>· They are
socially just and accessible:</b></p>
<p>Clever Caps can become inexpensive,
educational, and fun toys for children; raw material for artisans; and learning
tools to foster environmental awareness and develop creativity for people of
all ages.</p>
<p><b>· They are
economically viable:</b></p>
<p>No extra phases are added to the
manufacturing of caps (same manufacturing process of conventional caps).</p>
<p>No extra phases are added to the
bottling process (bottle filling and cap screwing).  Only assembly line adjustments are needed.</p>
<p>They use the same raw materials as
conventional caps and their weight increment is small, without a significant price
increase.</p>
<p><b>- Are Clever
Caps against recycling?</b></p>
<p>Not at all.
Recycling is essential for our planet.</p>
<p>It is impossible not to recycle the
trash we generate and just take new raw materials from the environment. </p>
<p>The matter is that recyclinged also
leaves an environmental footprint.</p>
<p>To turn trash into a new product, it must be sorted
out as different materials (plastic, paper, glass, aluminum, organic material,
etc.), washed, crushed, granulated until it becomes a new raw material. </p>
<p>This recycled raw material must be processed in
injecting, blowing, and extruding  machines, and only
then will it become a new product.</p>
<p>During all of these processes, a lot
of electricity and fuel (for the various transportation phases) will be spent.</p>
<p>Both the use of electrical power
(66% of which is generated by thermal plants) and the diesel-based
transportation release CO2 gas, one the villains of the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p><b>Our proposal
with Clever Caps is reuse, which avoids all of these phases. It is also an
alternative to recycling.</b></p>
<p><b>- Can Clever
Caps be recycled?</b></p>
<p>Yes. They
are made from the same raw materials as conventional caps: polypropylene or
polyethylene, plastics that can be 100% recycled. </p>
<p>However, because they can be used to
assemble objects and develop people’s creativity, we believe using them as
building blocks is a better alternative.</p>
<p><b>- I like the
idea but will not be using Clever Caps on a daily life.
What can I do with them?</b></p>
<p>If you do not want to use Clever
Caps, you can donate them to a day-care center, school, etc. Children will be happy with the donation since
the Clever Caps will be used as toys. Another
choice is to donate them to artisans who can use them as raw material in their
projects. Bars and restaurants can use
Clever Caps in a smart and creative manner. The
possibilities for using and reusing the caps are endless!</p>
<p><b>- Don’t Clever
Caps violate Lego’s intellectual property right?</b></p>
<p>Within the limits of
our knowledge and based on studies conducted by specialists in intellectual
property (copyrights), we understand that Lego’s trademark rights are not violated. A patent is valid for 20 years, so .... This view is also strengthened by the fact that
building blocks compatible with Lego blocks have been sold internationally for
years by several competing companies.</p>
<p>We are great admirers of Lego and we
believe that bringing Clever Caps to the market can enhance their brand’s
success even more.</p>
<p><b>- Is Clever
Caps’ weight difference significant?</b></p>
<p>No, the weight difference between a
Clever Cap and most ""conventional"" plastic bottle caps is minimal
because Clever Caps are lower than most conventional caps so they can be
compatible with Lego blocks. So, even with the little ears and pins, the weight
difference is very small.</p>
<p><b>- How are
Clever Caps applied to bottles in bottling lines?</b></p>
<p>The same way as conventional caps. No new machines or additional manufacturing
phases are required - only adjustments to existing equipment.</p>
<p><b>- What are
other Clever Caps advantages?</b></p>
<p>In addition to bringing the concept
of sustainability to life, we took into consideration several points during the
realization of Clever Caps:</p>
<p>- Foster the development of users’
creativity.</p>
<p>- Enhance the access of needy
children to smart and creative toys.</p>
<p>- Serve as an input to projects by
artisans and artists.</p>
<p>- Help awaken and develop a
“sustainable mind frame” for final users.</p>
<p>- Diminish the amount of plastic
discarded, often not recycled, into the environment.</p>
<p>- Provide an extra purchase decision
factor for the consumer: packaging reuse.</p>
<p>- Make advertising campaigns easier
through the compatibility with Lego blocks </p>
<p>- Make opening easier,
due to the better grip and bigger leverage.</p>
<p><b>- Are Clever Caps
BPA-free?</b></p>

Yes<br/>

<p>Thanks for visiting Clever Caps crowdfunding campaign site. We hope you will like our project and our cause. </p>
<p>By contributing with our campaign, you will also be helping poor children either directly (you can choose the ""Donation Perk"" for which each 1 dolar will be transformed into 10 Clever Caps to be donated to charity institutions) or indirectly (the sooner we are able to increase production scale, the sooner more products closed with Clever Caps will reach the shelves, and the sooner ""used"" caps will be available to be reused as building blocks). </p>
<p>30 days after our campaign deadline we are still very far from our target. So, any contribution will be very important for us, You can help our campaign in 2 ways: by making a $ contribution and by inviting your friends to visit this site.</p>
<p>Even if we do not reach the $ 100,000 USD target, we will deliver the perks. In this case, the delivery will probably take 3-4 months longer, but we will deliver. </p>

<p>A versão redonda em 28 mm das Clever Caps, está totalmente pronta para ir ao mercado.</p>
<p>Ela funciona perfeitamente como:</p>
<p>- tampa (rosqueamento, vedação e funcionamento do lacre)</p>
<p>- bloco de montar (encaixes entre si e compatibilidade com blocos Lego)</p>
<p>A tampa já está certificada como brinquedo pelo INMETRO ( National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology - órgão brasileiro de certificações), sendo assim está aprovada para  ser comercializada.</p>O molde piloto/de desenvlvimento está validado para a produção das tampas.

<p>Nosso primeiro objetivo é a fabricação de moldes de escala
industrial dos 3 modelos das Clever Caps já desenvolvidas, para poder ter
escala de produção.</p>
<p>Em seguida, investiremos na expansão do conceito das Clever
Caps para outros segmentos de mercado e tipos de embalagem, como: embalagens
cartonadas, bebidas carbonatadas (com gás), iogurtes, pouches, cosméticos,
creme dental, etc.</p>
<p> As novas tampas
manterão os 2 pontos básicos que usamos nos 3 modelos já desenvolvidos:</p>
<p> - Elas se adaptarem
aos gargalos, existentes no mercado.</p>
<p> - As tampas serem
compatíveis com blocos Lego.</p>
<p>Acreditamos que com o crescimento das vendas teremos
condições de aumentar nossa escala de produção e a divulgação do produto, de
modo que produtos tampados com Clever Caps possam ser encontrados em vários
países.</p>
<p>Também é nosso desejo, que a popularização das Clever Caps
possa ajudar na disseminação de conhecimentos e práticas sustentáveis no dia a
dia das pessoas, bem como estimular inovações nessa direção.</p>
<p></p>

<p>As Clever Caps já são uma realidade. Entretanto, 
para alavancarmos o projeto, precisamos ter escala de produção, e para 
isso acontecer, precisamos do financiamento da fabricação do molde de 
escala industrial, tanto da versão redonda em 28 mm, quanto das versões 
quadrada e retangular.</p>

<p><b>- Quanto tempo levará para as Clever Caps chegarem às
prateleiras?</b></p>
<p>As Clever Caps, modelo CC1, fabricadas com o molde piloto,
deverão chegar às prateleiras nos próximos 60 dias, no Brasil. O nível de
sucesso nesse projeto de Crowd Funding terá um importante impacto na aceleração
da comercialização e expansão das Clever Caps. Ou seja, cada colaboração nos
ajudará a colocar as novas tampas no mercado, objetivando expandir esse conceito
de sustentabilidade na prática.</p>
<p><b>- Por que as Clever Caps são sustentáveis?</b></p>
<p>Elas são sustentáveis pois atendem aos 3 critérios de um
produto sustentável:</p>
<p><b>· São ecologicamente corretas:</b></p>
<p>As Clever Caps deixam uma menor pegada ambiental, pois serão
reutilizadas diretamente, ou seja, não precisam passar por nenhum processo
industrial, como a reciclagem.</p>
<p>A reciclagem é muito importante para o nosso planeta,
porém,  muitos gases CO 2 são liberados durante o processo. Assim, o reuso
direto de um produto é mais sustentável do que a reciclagem. Além disso, muitas
das tampas vão para o lixo comum e não chegam a ser recicladas. E outras tantas
são jogadas nas ruas, no mar, nas praias, etc, poluindo o meio ambiente.</p>
<p><b>· São socialmente justas e acessíveis:</b></p>
<p>As Clever Caps podem se tornar brinquedos baratos,
educativos e divertidos para crianças carentes, materiais para artesãos e
ferramentas didáticas para estimular a consciência ecológica e desenvolver a
criatividade das pessoas de todas as idades.</p>
<p><b>· São economicamente viáveis para a indústria:</b></p>
<p>Não acrescentam etapas na fabricação da tampa, pois usam do
mesmo processo de fabricação das tampas convencionais.</p>
<p>Não acrescentam etapas no envase (enchimento do frasco e
montagem da tampa), apenas alguns ajustes na linha de montagem.</p>
<p>Usam as mesmas matérias primas das tampas convencionais e o
incremento de matéria prima é pequeno, sem aumento significativo no preço.</p>
<p><b>- A Clever Caps é contra a reciclagem?</b></p>
<p>De forma alguma. A reciclagem é essencial para o nosso
planeta.</p>
<p>É impossível não reciclar o lixo que geramos e só retirar
novas matérias primas do meio ambiente. A questão é que a reciclagem também
deixa uma pegada ambiental.</p>
<p>O lixo tem que ser separado entre os diversos matérias como
plástico, papel, vidro, alumínio, material orgânico, etc. Esses materiais tem
que ser lavados, moídos, re-separados (caso do plástico separando o PP do PE,
do PET, etc.), secos, extrusados, granulados ou derretidos, etc. até que se
transformem em uma nova matéria prima. Aí, então, esse material é novamente
processado para virar um novo produto e fechar o ciclo novamente para ser usado
pelo consumidor.</p>
<p>Então, para o lixo virar um novo produto, muita energia
elétrica terá sido consumida e diversos materiais poluentes poderão ter sido
usados no processo, inclusive nas diversas etapas de transporte desses
materiais.</p>
<p>O transporte gera gás CO2 com a queima de óleo diesel.</p>
<p>Sabemos que 66% da energia elétrica do planeta vem da queima
de petróleo, gás ou carvão. Ou seja, a cada 3 máquinas elétricas, 2 funcionam
indiretamente com petróleo, gás ou carvão gerando CO2, que é o vilão do efeito
estufa.</p>
<p>O que propomos com Clever Caps é o reuso, uma alternativa
mais barata e  mais simples para a reciclagem.</p>
<p><b>- As Clever Caps podem ser recicladas?</b></p>
<p>Sim. Elas são fabricadas com as mesmas matérias primas que
tampas convencionais, Polipropileno ou Polietileno, plásticos que podem ser
100% reciclados. Entretanto, como elas podem ser usadas para montar objetos e
desenvolver a criatividade das pessoas, acreditamos que elas tem um melhor
aproveitamento como bloco de montar.</p>
<p><b>- Acho a ideia bacana, mas não irei usar as Clever Caps
no meu dia a dia. O que posso fazer com elas?</b></p>
<p>Se você não quiser usar as Clever Caps, você pode doa-las
para uma creche, escola, etc. As crianças ficarão felizes com a doação, pois
elas serão usadas como brinquedos. Outra opção é doá-las para artesãos, que
poderão usá-las como matéria prima para seus projetos. Bares e restaurantes
podem usar as Clever Caps de forma inteligente e criativa. As possibilidades de
uso e aproveitamento das tampas são muitas!</p>
<p><b>- As Clever Caps não infringem direitos da marca Lego?</b></p>
<p>Dentro dos nossos melhores conhecimentos e com base em
estudos de especialistas em propriedade intelectual, entendemos que
não. Uma patente tem validade de 20 anos, assim .... Colabora com essa
percepção o fato que blocos de montar compatíveis com blocos Lego são
comercializados internacionalmente, há anos, por várias empresas concorrentes.</p>
<p>Somos grandes admiradores da Lego e acreditamos que a
colocação das Clever Caps no mercado possa contribuir com o sucesso ainda maior
da marca.</p>
<p><b>- A diferença de peso das Clever Caps é significativo?</b></p>
<p>Não, a diferença de peso entre uma Clever Cap e a maioria
das tampas ""convencionais"" de garrafas PET é mínima, pois as Clever
Caps são mais baixas que a maioria das tampas convencionais para poderem ser
 compatíveis com os blocos Lego, assim mesmo com as orelhinhas e os
pininhos a diferença de peso é bem pequena.</p>

<p><b>- Como as Clever Caps são aplicadas nos frascos nas
linhas de envase?</b></p>
<p>Da mesma forma que as tampas convencionais. Não precisa de
maquinas novas ou etapas adicionais de fabricação, apenas ajustes nos
equipamentos existentes.</p>
<p><b>- Que outras vantagens as Clever Caps possuem?</b></p>
<p>Além do conceito da sustentabilidade na prática, levamos em
conta diversos pontos quando idealizamos as Clever Caps:</p>
<p>- Estimular o desenvolvimento da criatividade dos usuários.</p>
<p>- Aumentar o acesso a brinquedos inteligentes e criativos a
crianças carentes.</p>
<p>- Servir como insumo para trabalhos de artesãos e artistas.</p>
<p>- Contribuir para despertar e desenvolver o ""pensamento
sustentável"" no consumidor final.</p>
<p>- Diminuir a quantidade de plástico descartado no meio
ambiente, que muitas vezes não é reciclado.</p>
<p>- Acrescentar um fator de decisão de compra para o
consumidor: reutilizar parte da embalagem no seu dia a dia.</p>
<p>- Compatibilidade com blocos Lego facilita campanhas
promocionais (rodinhas, bonecos, etc.)</p>
<p>- Maior facilidade de abertura das embalagens.</p>
<p><b>- As Clever Caps são livres de BPA?</b></p>

We hope you will like our project and our cause. By contributing with our campaign, you will also be helping poor children either directly (you can choose the ""Donation Perk"" for which each 1 dolar will be transformed into 10 Clever Caps to be donated to charity institutions) or indirectly (the sooner we are able to increase production scale, the sooner more products closed with Clever Caps will reach the shelves, and the sooner ""used"" caps will be available to be reused as building blocks). 30 days after our campaign deadline we are still very far from our target. So, any contribution will be very important for us, You can help our campaign in 2 ways: by making a $ contribution and by inviting your friends to visit this site.Even if we do not reach the $ 100,000 USD target, we will deliver the perks. In this case, the delivery will probably take 3-4 months longer, but we will deliver. Thanks for your help.Henry Suzuki, Claudio Patrick Vollers & Clever Caps TeamClever Caps donations tocharity organizationsClever Caps are reusable caps that have two
lives straight out of the factory:
-  in the first
life, it is a cap-  in the second,
a building block.
Using them requires no other action. Take it off the bottle and use it.The caps will no longer go into the garbage neither will they make streets, beaches, etc. dirty. They will be bilt into daily life objects and toys.
Clever Caps were designed to adapt to the market:- 
they can be
used with standard bottleneck bottles

- 
they are compatible with Lego blocks
- 
they are made from the same recyclable raw materials as conventional caps.Eco Design, putting the concept of reuse into practice.

Playing with Clever Caps is funny. You will not want to stop. Any time somebody will find a new way to use them.


Good for children and bring the family together


Field activity with
Clever Caps development batch. Many generations sat
together to play with the Caps, like the old times.




For a product to be sustainable it must be:
- Environmentally correct
- Socially just
-  Economically viable

Environmentally correct:

They are reusable, less likely to leave garbage on the streets, beaches, oceans, etc., and are an alternative to recycling 




An alternative to recycling
Recycling is very important for the planet but it does leave an environmental footprint since CO2 gas is released during the phases of transportation and also the use electrical power (separation of the different materials, washing, and reprocessing).
Note:66 % of the world’s electrical power comes from thermal plants, which burn fossil fuel and release CO2 gas.




Long process for new product



Directly to a new product, second life



We are to test Clever
Caps manufacture with renewable materials. It will be one additional step for
the good of the environment.


We can help change this scenario!Clever Caps will help changing this scenario!



Socially just:

An inexpensive toy that awakens children’s creativity.
One more choice of raw material for artisans.


Economically viable:

No extra phases are added to the manufacturing of caps or to the bottling line.
Minimal difference in material
They use the same raw material as
conventional caps.



- Bringing together people from different generations in activities to assemble objects and toys
- Bringing needy children closer to a fairer world, giving them the chance to create and assemble several toys.
- Contributing to a lower environmental impact
- Awakening people so they can look for alternative solutions.
- Inspiring people to leave routine and be back to childhood, even if for a while
- Breaking barriers: caps from different products and different companies interacting.











After a long development phase involving designers, engineers, and technicians the round 28 mm version of the Clever Caps is completely ready to go to market.
It works perfectly as a:
- cap (threading, sealing and how the seal works)
- building block (they can be assembled with each other and are compatible with Lego blocks)
The cap has already been certified as a toy by the INMETRO (National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology – the Brazilian certification agency). It is therefore approved for marketing.
The pilot/development mold is validated for the production of caps in low volumes. Several tests have been performed, and scaling up will be a question of investment in the acquisition bigger molds.
Pilot/development mold,one single cap per injection cycle 


A Brazilian bottled mineral water brand is finalizing tests in their bottling/production line. Within the next 60 days they will be selling mineral water bottles, closed with Clever Caps produced with the pilot mold.
Square and rectangular Clever Cap models are in the final phase of pilot mold adjustments and tests.

Our first goal is to manufacture industrial scale molds of the 3 Clever Cap models already developed so production scale can be achieved.
We will then invest in expanding the concept of Clever Caps to other market segments and other kinds of packaging.We believe that with sales growth we will be able to increase our production scale and to advertise globalize the product, so products using Clever Caps can be seen in various countries.
It is also our wish that as
Clever Caps become better known, they will help disseminate sustainable
knowledge and practices in people's daily lives, as well as encourage
innovation in this direction.


Clever Caps are a reality
already. However, in order to leverage the
project it is essential that production scale be achieved. To make that happen
we need financing to manufacture industrial scale molds.(most costly item in
the project).










- Why do we need to invest in bigger molds, if we already have molds?
Right now, we have a single cavity mold, which makes just one cap per injection cycle. This is OK for samples or even for a first subsidized pilot launch. However, in order to reach a virtuous cycle of growth, we need bigger molds with much more cavities which will allow us both lower production cost and increase manufacture scale.
- Where will the caps be made?
Clever Caps will be made either in Brazil or in the United States.
- Why the shipping cost is so high?
Sending goods overseas from Brazil is quite expensive. We are looking for ways to lower shipping costs. If we succeed (and we hope we will) we will share the savings with our contributors by sending additional of caps.
- How long will
it take to get Clever Caps to shelves?
The first commercial
product to be marketed with Clever Caps will be a Brazilian local brand mineral
water. For this forthcoming low scale pilot launch, Clever Caps will be
manufactured with the pilot mold. 
The level of success in this Crowd
Funding project will have an important impact on the speed of marketing and
expansion of the Clever Caps. That means
that each contribution will help us bring the new caps to market with the goal
of practical expansion of this sustainability concept.
- Why are
Clever Caps sustainable?
They are sustainable because they
meet the 3 criteria of a sustainable product:
· They are
environmentally correct:
Clever Caps leave a smaller
environmental footprint because they will be directly reused, i.e., they do not
require any industrial processing.
Since the caps will be reused there
is less garbage in the streets, ocean, beaches, etc.
· They are
socially just and accessible:
Clever Caps can become inexpensive,
educational, and fun toys for children; raw material for artisans; and learning
tools to foster environmental awareness and develop creativity for people of
all ages.
· They are
economically viable:
No extra phases are added to the
manufacturing of caps (same manufacturing process of conventional caps).
No extra phases are added to the
bottling process (bottle filling and cap screwing).  Only assembly line adjustments are needed.
They use the same raw materials as
conventional caps and their weight increment is small, without a significant price
increase.
- Are Clever
Caps against recycling?
Not at all.
Recycling is essential for our planet.
It is impossible not to recycle the
trash we generate and just take new raw materials from the environment. 
The matter is that recyclinged also
leaves an environmental footprint.
To turn trash into a new product, it must be sorted
out as different materials (plastic, paper, glass, aluminum, organic material,
etc.), washed, crushed, granulated until it becomes a new raw material. 
This recycled raw material must be processed in
injecting, blowing, and extruding  machines, and only
then will it become a new product.
During all of these processes, a lot
of electricity and fuel (for the various transportation phases) will be spent.
Both the use of electrical power
(66% of which is generated by thermal plants) and the diesel-based
transportation release CO2 gas, one the villains of the greenhouse effect.
Our proposal
with Clever Caps is reuse, which avoids all of these phases. It is also an
alternative to recycling.
- Can Clever
Caps be recycled?
Yes. They
are made from the same raw materials as conventional caps: polypropylene or
polyethylene, plastics that can be 100% recycled. 
However, because they can be used to
assemble objects and develop people’s creativity, we believe using them as
building blocks is a better alternative.
- I like the
idea but will not be using Clever Caps on a daily life.
What can I do with them?
If you do not want to use Clever
Caps, you can donate them to a day-care center, school, etc. Children will be happy with the donation since
the Clever Caps will be used as toys. Another
choice is to donate them to artisans who can use them as raw material in their
projects. Bars and restaurants can use
Clever Caps in a smart and creative manner. The
possibilities for using and reusing the caps are endless!
- Don’t Clever
Caps violate Lego’s intellectual property right?
Within the limits of
our knowledge and based on studies conducted by specialists in intellectual
property (copyrights), we understand that Lego’s trademark rights are not violated. A patent is valid for 20 years, so .... This view is also strengthened by the fact that
building blocks compatible with Lego blocks have been sold internationally for
years by several competing companies.
We are great admirers of Lego and we
believe that bringing Clever Caps to the market can enhance their brand’s
success even more.
- Is Clever
Caps’ weight difference significant?
No, the weight difference between a
Clever Cap and most ""conventional"" plastic bottle caps is minimal
because Clever Caps are lower than most conventional caps so they can be
compatible with Lego blocks. So, even with the little ears and pins, the weight
difference is very small.
- How are
Clever Caps applied to bottles in bottling lines?
The same way as conventional caps. No new machines or additional manufacturing
phases are required - only adjustments to existing equipment.
- What are
other Clever Caps advantages?
In addition to bringing the concept
of sustainability to life, we took into consideration several points during the
realization of Clever Caps:
- Foster the development of users’
creativity.
- Enhance the access of needy
children to smart and creative toys.
- Serve as an input to projects by
artisans and artists.
- Help awaken and develop a
“sustainable mind frame” for final users.
- Diminish the amount of plastic
discarded, often not recycled, into the environment.
- Provide an extra purchase decision
factor for the consumer: packaging reuse.
- Make advertising campaigns easier
through the compatibility with Lego blocks 
- Make opening easier,
due to the better grip and bigger leverage.
- Are Clever Caps
BPA-free?

Yes

Para um produto ser sustentável ele deve ser:
- Ecologicamente correto
- Socialmente justo
-  Economicamente viável 

Ecologicamente correto:
As Clever Caps são reutilizáveis, então colaboram em deixar menos lixo espalhado pelas ruas, praias, mares, etc. e são uma alternativa para a reciclagem,


Uma alternativa a reciclagem
A
 reciclagem é muito importante para o planeta, porem também deixa uma 
pegada ambiental, visto que libera gás CO2 durante as etapas de 
transporte e de consumo de energia elétrica.
Obs: 66 % da energia elétrica mundial vem de termolétricas, que queimam combustível fóssil liberando gás CO2.
O CO2 é o vilão do o maior problema ambiental: Efeito Estufa!

Longo processo para obtenção de um novo produto
É diretamente um novo produto, segunda vida

Nós podemos modificar esse cenário! 

Clever Caps will help changing this scenario!


Estamos testando a fabricação das Clever Caps em materiais recicláveis. Será um passo adicional para o bem ao meio ambiente.





Socialmente justa:

Um brinquedo barato que desperta a criantividade das crianças.
Mais uma escolha de matéria prima para os artesãos.


Economicamente viável:
Sem fases adicionais na fabricação das tampas ou na linha de envase.
Diferença mínima no material. 
Eles usam a mesma matéria-prima que as tampas convencionais.

A versão redonda em 28 mm das Clever Caps, está totalmente pronta para ir ao mercado.
Ela funciona perfeitamente como:
- tampa (rosqueamento, vedação e funcionamento do lacre)
- bloco de montar (encaixes entre si e compatibilidade com blocos Lego)
A tampa já está certificada como brinquedo pelo INMETRO ( National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology - órgão brasileiro de certificações), sendo assim está aprovada para  ser comercializada.O molde piloto/de desenvlvimento está validado para a produção das tampas. Já forma realizamos diversos testes com tiragens maiores.
Molde piloto em funcionamento

Uma
 marca de água mineral brasileira está finalizando os 
testes em sua linha de envase/produção. Nos próximos 60 dias está 
vendendo água mineral com as Clever Caps produzidas com o molde piloto.O modelos das Clever Caps quadrada e retangular estão em fase final de ajustes das tampas e teste dos moldes pilotos.



Nosso primeiro objetivo é a fabricação de moldes de escala
industrial dos 3 modelos das Clever Caps já desenvolvidas, para poder ter
escala de produção.
Em seguida, investiremos na expansão do conceito das Clever
Caps para outros segmentos de mercado e tipos de embalagem, como: embalagens
cartonadas, bebidas carbonatadas (com gás), iogurtes, pouches, cosméticos,
creme dental, etc.
 As novas tampas
manterão os 2 pontos básicos que usamos nos 3 modelos já desenvolvidos:
 - Elas se adaptarem
aos gargalos, existentes no mercado.
 - As tampas serem
compatíveis com blocos Lego.
Acreditamos que com o crescimento das vendas teremos
condições de aumentar nossa escala de produção e a divulgação do produto, de
modo que produtos tampados com Clever Caps possam ser encontrados em vários
países.
Também é nosso desejo, que a popularização das Clever Caps
possa ajudar na disseminação de conhecimentos e práticas sustentáveis no dia a
dia das pessoas, bem como estimular inovações nessa direção.




As Clever Caps já são uma realidade. Entretanto, 
para alavancarmos o projeto, precisamos ter escala de produção, e para 
isso acontecer, precisamos do financiamento da fabricação do molde de 
escala industrial, tanto da versão redonda em 28 mm, quanto das versões 
quadrada e retangular.





- Quanto tempo levará para as Clever Caps chegarem às
prateleiras?
As Clever Caps, modelo CC1, fabricadas com o molde piloto,
deverão chegar às prateleiras nos próximos 60 dias, no Brasil. O nível de
sucesso nesse projeto de Crowd Funding terá um importante impacto na aceleração
da comercialização e expansão das Clever Caps. Ou seja, cada colaboração nos
ajudará a colocar as novas tampas no mercado, objetivando expandir esse conceito
de sustentabilidade na prática.
- Por que as Clever Caps são sustentáveis?
Elas são sustentáveis pois atendem aos 3 critérios de um
produto sustentável:
· São ecologicamente corretas:
As Clever Caps deixam uma menor pegada ambiental, pois serão
reutilizadas diretamente, ou seja, não precisam passar por nenhum processo
industrial, como a reciclagem.
A reciclagem é muito importante para o nosso planeta,
porém,  muitos gases CO 2 são liberados durante o processo. Assim, o reuso
direto de um produto é mais sustentável do que a reciclagem. Além disso, muitas
das tampas vão para o lixo comum e não chegam a ser recicladas. E outras tantas
são jogadas nas ruas, no mar, nas praias, etc, poluindo o meio ambiente.
· São socialmente justas e acessíveis:
As Clever Caps podem se tornar brinquedos baratos,
educativos e divertidos para crianças carentes, materiais para artesãos e
ferramentas didáticas para estimular a consciência ecológica e desenvolver a
criatividade das pessoas de todas as idades.
· São economicamente viáveis para a indústria:
Não acrescentam etapas na fabricação da tampa, pois usam do
mesmo processo de fabricação das tampas convencionais.
Não acrescentam etapas no envase (enchimento do frasco e
montagem da tampa), apenas alguns ajustes na linha de montagem.
Usam as mesmas matérias primas das tampas convencionais e o
incremento de matéria prima é pequeno, sem aumento significativo no preço.
- A Clever Caps é contra a reciclagem?
De forma alguma. A reciclagem é essencial para o nosso
planeta.
É impossível não reciclar o lixo que geramos e só retirar
novas matérias primas do meio ambiente. A questão é que a reciclagem também
deixa uma pegada ambiental.
O lixo tem que ser separado entre os diversos matérias como
plástico, papel, vidro, alumínio, material orgânico, etc. Esses materiais tem
que ser lavados, moídos, re-separados (caso do plástico separando o PP do PE,
do PET, etc.), secos, extrusados, granulados ou derretidos, etc. até que se
transformem em uma nova matéria prima. Aí, então, esse material é novamente
processado para virar um novo produto e fechar o ciclo novamente para ser usado
pelo consumidor.
Então, para o lixo virar um novo produto, muita energia
elétrica terá sido consumida e diversos materiais poluentes poderão ter sido
usados no processo, inclusive nas diversas etapas de transporte desses
materiais.
O transporte gera gás CO2 com a queima de óleo diesel.
Sabemos que 66% da energia elétrica do planeta vem da queima
de petróleo, gás ou carvão. Ou seja, a cada 3 máquinas elétricas, 2 funcionam
indiretamente com petróleo, gás ou carvão gerando CO2, que é o vilão do efeito
estufa.
O que propomos com Clever Caps é o reuso, uma alternativa
mais barata e  mais simples para a reciclagem.
- As Clever Caps podem ser recicladas?
Sim. Elas são fabricadas com as mesmas matérias primas que
tampas convencionais, Polipropileno ou Polietileno, plásticos que podem ser
100% reciclados. Entretanto, como elas podem ser usadas para montar objetos e
desenvolver a criatividade das pessoas, acreditamos que elas tem um melhor
aproveitamento como bloco de montar.
- Acho a ideia bacana, mas não irei usar as Clever Caps
no meu dia a dia. O que posso fazer com elas?
Se você não quiser usar as Clever Caps, você pode doa-las
para uma creche, escola, etc. As crianças ficarão felizes com a doação, pois
elas serão usadas como brinquedos. Outra opção é doá-las para artesãos, que
poderão usá-las como matéria prima para seus projetos. Bares e restaurantes
podem usar as Clever Caps de forma inteligente e criativa. As possibilidades de
uso e aproveitamento das tampas são muitas!
- As Clever Caps não infringem direitos da marca Lego?
Dentro dos nossos melhores conhecimentos e com base em
estudos de especialistas em propriedade intelectual, entendemos que
não. Uma patente tem validade de 20 anos, assim .... Colabora com essa
percepção o fato que blocos de montar compatíveis com blocos Lego são
comercializados internacionalmente, há anos, por várias empresas concorrentes.
Somos grandes admiradores da Lego e acreditamos que a
colocação das Clever Caps no mercado possa contribuir com o sucesso ainda maior
da marca.
- A diferença de peso das Clever Caps é significativo?
Não, a diferença de peso entre uma Clever Cap e a maioria
das tampas ""convencionais"" de garrafas PET é mínima, pois as Clever
Caps são mais baixas que a maioria das tampas convencionais para poderem ser
 compatíveis com os blocos Lego, assim mesmo com as orelhinhas e os
pininhos a diferença de peso é bem pequena.

- Como as Clever Caps são aplicadas nos frascos nas
linhas de envase?
Da mesma forma que as tampas convencionais. Não precisa de
maquinas novas ou etapas adicionais de fabricação, apenas ajustes nos
equipamentos existentes.
- Que outras vantagens as Clever Caps possuem?
Além do conceito da sustentabilidade na prática, levamos em
conta diversos pontos quando idealizamos as Clever Caps:
- Estimular o desenvolvimento da criatividade dos usuários.
- Aumentar o acesso a brinquedos inteligentes e criativos a
crianças carentes.
- Servir como insumo para trabalhos de artesãos e artistas.
- Contribuir para despertar e desenvolver o ""pensamento
sustentável"" no consumidor final.
- Diminuir a quantidade de plástico descartado no meio
ambiente, que muitas vezes não é reciclado.
- Acrescentar um fator de decisão de compra para o
consumidor: reutilizar parte da embalagem no seu dia a dia.
- Compatibilidade com blocos Lego facilita campanhas
promocionais (rodinhas, bonecos, etc.)
- Maior facilidade de abertura das embalagens.
- As Clever Caps são livres de BPA?

Sim.

<p>The Fair Game Eco Adventure Resort offers
flights from Toronto to Timmins and transportation to the resort form the
airport. Accommodations will be in fully-equipped cabins for two, four, or
eight people. High-end cuisine will be prepared at the main lodge which will
include a lounge a corporate facilities. Guided wilderness adventures will
include tracking and stalking irreplaceable wildlife while guests will be
quipped with a non-lethal rifle adapted with a smart device, filming high
points and photographing ""The Kill Shot!"" Evenings will be spent
eating, drinking, and reviewing the best shots of the day. </p>
<p>Revenue will come from customers such as
corporate team building events, transitioning hunters, European and domestic
family vacationers, and nature and Canadian heritage enthusiasts. </p>
<p>Expanding, The Fair Game Eco Adventure
Resort will add a spa to its facilities in addition to more lodging. A higher
quality kitchen will be installed to attract the best local chefs. With
consistent sales by this point, The Fair Game Eco Adventure Resort can approach
a regular airline that services Toronto to Timmins to create a strategic
partnership.</p>
<p><b>Key
Services Offered</b></p>
<p>Accommodations
and food services</p>
<p>Hosting guests for a number of nights is
integral to Fair Game Eco Adventure’s business plan. As such, accommodations
will be constructed in the form of cabins containing individual rooms with a
main lodge that will serve as a place for meeting, relaxing, and dining. A
full-service kitchen will provide guests with all meals throughout day, or
alternatively, pack meals for when guests will be out on an expedition. </p>
<p>Ethical
Hunting</p>
<p>At the center of Fair Game Eco Adventure’s
business is the tracking and pursuit of the wildlife that inhabit the estate
and surrounding crown land. As such, dedicated guides well-versed in the ways
of game tracking, hiking, nature, and the wilderness will lead expeditions
throughout the area. These expeditions can be tailored to guest experience
level and, of course, the time of day. </p>
<p>Fishing</p>
<p>As an alternative adventure to
wilderness expeditions, guests can fish in the many rivers and lakes on the
property. Fishing equipment is on site with professionals that can assist
guests if required. </p>
<p>Hiking</p>
<p>An alternative to the intensive
expedition and tracking that encompasses much of a guests time at the Fair Game
Lodge is basic hiking. Ranging from a self led tour of the property on marked
trails and paths to going on group walks, guests can get a last minute taste of
the forest or simply not be out for the many hours that an expedition
requires. </p>
<p><b>Sales
Plan</b></p>
<p>To coincide with marketing initiative,
and to tie into sales initiatives, Fair Game Eco Adventure should consider
being present at as many conferences and trade shows as possible. In this way,
the brand and name can begin to circulate within the industry and within the
devoted niche of clients that would attend these kinds of events. Organic
promotion will then be possible. </p>
<p>Corporate</p>
<p>It will be important in the early stages
of Fair Game Eco Adventure to reach out to potential corporate partners looking
for locations for executive or employee retreats. Reaching out by phone or in
person will likely be the most effective methods for setting up in-person
meetings. Once in the door, a refined presentation could be given to elaborate
on the benefits of visiting the Fair Game Eco Adventure Resort. Materials could
also be left at each location.</p>
<p>Family</p>
<p>The family segment could potentially be
more difficult to reach directly. Some sales may come indirectly from corporate
contact. Some sales campaigns could take the form of mailouts targeting ideal
regions based on favourable demographics. Further, promotions could be
purchased with institutions like CAA or other travel magazines. </p>
<p>Nature-Enthusiast</p>
<p>This customer segment will most likely
be engaged with at trade conferences about nature, outdoorsmanship, hunting,
etc. </p>
<p><b>Operations
Plan</b></p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>Fair Game Eco Adventure will provide
necessary transportation to get to site. Generally, this will include booking round
trip airfare to Timmins where guests will be met at the airport and driven to
site. On site transportation will not be necessary as all activities will be
done on foot. All water activities will have appropriate equipment necessary,
such as canoes and floatation devices. </p>
<p>Accommodations/
Hospitality </p>
<p>The nature of Fair Game Eco Adventure’s
business plan is to provide all goods and services necessary for an enjoyable
week long stay in the Ontario wilderness. Cabins will have all amenities
necessary for an enjoyable stay, including linens, towels, bedding, bathrooms,
and showers. Any special requests will be happily met with advanced notice for
those with mobility restrictions etc. </p>
<p>Food
and beverage</p>
<p>Clientele will enjoy home cooked meals
for the duration of their stay and will have a wide selection of beverages
available to suit their needs. All meals will be provided as part of the charge
for the week’s stay and will be cooked by qualified employees, meeting all
health standards and regulations. </p>
<p>Ethical
Hunting</p>
<p>A knowledgeable and experienced guide
will provide nature tours for Fair Game patrons. Services will include tracking
of various wildlife and information about various species to provide both an
informative and fun tour. Ontario is home to many different species of
wildlife, however, variability will exist in what wildlife are seen depending
on the time of year.</p>
<p>Fishing
and boating</p>
<p>Fishing will require various forms of
equipment including rods, fishing line, bait, tackle boxes etc. In order for fishing
to be successful, a guide may be necessary depending on the difficulty of
catching fish as well as the process of releasing fish back into the water.
Maintenance of all boating equipment as well as storage will also be
necessary. </p>
<p>For
the Kids/ Family</p>
<p>Offering informative and engaging
sessions about the lives of nearby First Nations is part of Fair Game’s planned
operations. This will benefit multiple stakeholders including First Nations and
may offer employment opportunities. Packages containing information as well as
research will be necessary aspect of operations. </p>
<p><b>Start-up
Plan</b></p>
<p>Site
Planning</p>
<p>Site visits to determine an ideal
location for the lodge, followed by the blueprinting and mapping out of the
surrounding area. It will also be important to start mapping the routes for
planned expeditions with guests. </p>
<p>Material
and machine purchase/ rent</p>
<p>Based on the plan, rent the necessary
equipment and machinery and buy the appropriate materials as they are
necessary. </p>
<p>Construction</p>
<p>Assemble a proficient and reliable team
to execute the building plan. </p>
<p>Stakeholder
Engagement</p>
<p>While construction is happening, engage
with local stakeholder groups including native bands. Constructive
conversations should inform if there is an opportunity for a fruitful strategic
partnership. Topics to explore could include involving them in the leading of
expeditions through Fair Game land in addition to the surrounding crown land.
It could also be worthwhile to discuss the potential for the resort to host
guest-engagement activities with the natives to learn about the culture and
ways of life.</p>
<p>Marketing
and PR</p>
<p>While construction and stakeholder
engagement meetings are happening, the marketing team should be reaching out to
local and provincial media about all that Fair Game Eco Adventure has to offer,
its vision, mission, and overall service offerings. It is important to get
traction as early in the process as possible to ensure that, by opening time,
there are many bookings and stories. </p>
<p>Pre-book
a few months</p>
<p>As a part of the marketing process, it
is especially important in the early days to have at least weekends sold out
for a couple of months. Word of mouth will hopefully perpetuate this process,
in addition to online efforts, and enable constant and reliable revenues. </p>
<p>Hiring
and training</p>
<p>Staff will need to be hired and trained
just before construction is completed. A maid, a grounds keeper, kitchen and
wait staff, a front desk concierge, and expedition guides are among the staff
that will be necessary to run the resort. </p>
<p>Soft-Opening</p>
<p>As a part of the training process and
the testing of all accommodations, equipment, and processes, a soft opening
will be conducted with family and friends of the owner and employees. This will
allow the staff to work in a live environment, will provide an opportunity to
add services that might be missing, eliminate irrelevant processes, and better
prepare the facility to receive paying patrons. </p>
<p>Hard-Opening</p>
<p>With the media present and invited to
stay and enjoy a weekend experience, Fair Game Eco Adventure Resort will
officially open to the public. </p>
<p>Sustained
operations</p>
<p>With reservations for at least a few
months in advance, the resort can continue to operate, learn, and perfect the
services that it offers. </p>

<p>I’m Rick Sokoloff and I've been
skiing, mountain biking and living in Stowe, VT for the past 36 years. I was
the co-founder of the Stowe Mountain Bike Club and founding president. I ran
the club for over 10 years and help develop over 50 miles of legal and
permanent trail. </p>
<p></p>
<p>What I saw was missing was a better way for people to get
started. Being a ski instructor, I realized we could make it
easier. I am certified by the International Mountain Bike Association and spent a lot of time teaching and guiding. I am very excited that there is a real need, not only to learn, but to be shown around, given some tips and to share some local knowledge. </p>
<p>With that in mind, I started 4 Points VT, a Mountain Bike School, with Guides and Brewery Tours. Yup,
Brewery Tours, the best thing after a ride. And you don’t have to go on a
mountain bike ride to visit the breweries. It's a great combo, but not everyone will get on a mountain bike and you don't have to go on a brewery tour to mountain bike.</p>
<p>I’m running this Indiegogo campaign
to get this business going. I have upfront costs and need to pre-sell trips to
raise money to purchase a 12 passenger van for guests and a 12 foot trailer for
the bikes. You can help; buy something and use it anytime, it will <b><u>not expire</u></b>.
And to make it worth your while, I’m offering discounts on mountain bike
lessons, guide service and brewery tours. </p>
<p>The offerings make great gifts or
company outings! Bring your employees or friends on a brew tour, get them on a
bike or do a special event; bike in the morning, have lunch and take a brew
tour in the afternoon! Please check out the ‘Perks’ and see if there’ anything
you might like. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>To get started I will need to raise
around $25,000. This will give me a down payment on a 12 passenger van, a
trailer for bikes, a small marketing budget and a down payment on the insurance,

</div></div>","Short Summary 
I’m Rick Sokoloff and I've been
skiing, mountain biking and living in Stowe, VT for the past 36 years. I was
the co-founder of the Stowe Mountain Bike Club and founding president. I ran
the club for over 10 years and help develop over 50 miles of legal and
permanent trail. 

What I saw was missing was a better way for people to get
started. Being a ski instructor, I realized we could make it
easier. I am certified by the International Mountain Bike Association and spent a lot of time teaching and guiding. I am very excited that there is a real need, not only to learn, but to be shown around, given some tips and to share some local knowledge. 
With that in mind, I started 4 Points VT, a Mountain Bike School, with Guides and Brewery Tours. Yup,
Brewery Tours, the best thing after a ride. And you don’t have to go on a
mountain bike ride to visit the breweries. It's a great combo, but not everyone will get on a mountain bike and you don't have to go on a brewery tour to mountain bike.
I’m running this Indiegogo campaign
to get this business going. I have upfront costs and need to pre-sell trips to
raise money to purchase a 12 passenger van for guests and a 12 foot trailer for
the bikes. You can help; buy something and use it anytime, it will not expire.
And to make it worth your while, I’m offering discounts on mountain bike
lessons, guide service and brewery tours. 
The offerings make great gifts or
company outings! Bring your employees or friends on a brew tour, get them on a
bike or do a special event; bike in the morning, have lunch and take a brew
tour in the afternoon! Please check out the ‘Perks’ and see if there’ anything
you might like. 
   What We Need & What You Get 
To get started I will need to raise
around $25,000. This will give me a down payment on a 12 passenger van, a
trailer for bikes, a small marketing budget and a down payment on the insurance,
legal fees and accounting. 
What you get is the opportunity to have great experiences in the green mountains of Vermont. If you become a mountain biker, you get to live a healthy, active lifestyle. You also get to help build the mountain bike economy and support the local community.    The Impact 
The past 15 years has seen an
incredible trail network develop in Stowe. And in the last five years we have
seen mountain biking explode, not only in Stowe, but around the country if not
the entire world. 
I am passionate about this project,
not only do I get to work with something I love, but it will also make a

<h3><strong>Support System for a Weightless Feel</strong></h3>
<p>The foundation of the Lucky Backpack is that the market lacks a solution that provides maximum comfortability while allowing travelers to pack and reach enough items for months on the road. We’ve created a state-of-the-art support system to keep your back straight and distribute the weight of the pack evenly onto your back and shoulders at all times.</p>
<p>The backpack contains a supportive metal plate that holds the padded back panel. This means that no matter what items are inside of your pack your back will always feel the padded straight back panel.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522675390/nxav9jvpsbtgsej4k76p.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3><strong>An Exterior Built to Last</strong></h3>
<p><br/>Building a world-class exterior for our modern day community of adventurers was no simple task. We arrived at the perfect balance of visual appeal and functionality. Starting with a high-quality polyester fabric that is sure to make the backpack last for years and endure countless weather conditions around the world. </p>
<p>On the other hand, we understood a simple but critical problem with current travel backpacks: All backpacks with enough room to fit ALL the items you'll need for a long adventure did not look good or had an opening at the top making your items inaccessible unless you removed all your items from the pack.</p>
<p>That is why we built this backpack with full carry-on suitcase style functionality. Meaning it will open 180 degrees flat across the backpack. Now there exists a travel backpack that works like a carry-on AND is capable of storing all the things you'll need on your next adventure. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523979003/h0yp7f9sre78bostjzfa.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Ever had to store certain items that you need to be hidden from the public eye? Your phone, passports, personal medicine? Our back panel is designed with a special pocket to be visible and accessible only to the traveler carrying the pack.</p>

<h3><strong>Superior Carry-On Interior</strong></h3>
<p>The interior of the backpack features expansive technology that will expand the fabric of the pack as you fill the main compartment. Simply place all your belongings inside and the backpack will expand accordingly to its optimal size. </p>
<p>We also equipped the backpack with highly functional compartments and features including an area to separate your dirty clothes or shoes, pockets for toiletries and essentials, and a compartment for your external battery.</p>
<p><strong>Fully Carry-On Access - 180 Degree Main Compartment</strong></p>
<p>The Lucky Backpack functions exactly as a carry-on suitcase because it opens completely 180 degrees. Lay the pack horizontally flat and pack all your things. The backpack will stretch proportionally to fit everything. Easily reach any of your items at all times.</p>

<h3>
<strong>The Lucky Backpack Design - Built By Adventures for Adventures</strong> </h3>
<p>The journey started by taking a leap of faith when our founder Edgar decided to live abroad instead of taking a consulting job in New York City. From that moment, the Lucky Backpack community was being born. We grew into the hundreds and then thousands by visiting countless countries, meeting travelers around the world, but most importantly discovering the beautiful cultures in every corner of the globe.</p>
<p>From this experience, we learned all about the life and journey of thousands of travelers: Their glories, their struggles, their stories. We saw a large opportunity to create a product with them for the entire adventure community. </p>
<p>Over the past 2 years, we captured pain points in hostels, airports, music festival, and many more places. We held critical focus groups with people from over 35 countries in person, online, and every other method in between. We arrived at the Lucky Backpack. By us for us. </p>

<p>Growing up we never had the opportunity to travel or explore the world so the Lucky Backpack story all began with a decision to live abroad and travel the world before starting the corporate world after graduation. That experience over the last three years led us to meet thousands of people from around the world with beautiful cultures and precious traditions.</p>
<p>We were personally moved by the experiences we had that it changed our lives forever making us better individuals and opening our views to the effect that worldwide travel can have many seeking opportunities for a better life.</p>
<p>That is why we created Lucky Backpack, with the mission to provide products to allow anyone with the will to explore the world to do so regardless of their financial or demographic background.</p>
<p>Our backpack is built to function as a carry-on to solve the vast majority of problems of backpacking like removing back pain, storing dirty clothes, safety pockets, storing and retrieving essentials on the go,  all without having to shed out the premium price on the market.</p>

</div></div>","WE TRAVELED THE WORLD AND LEARNED OF MAJOR PAIN POINTS. WE SOLVED THEM.

Support System for a Weightless Feel
The foundation of the Lucky Backpack is that the market lacks a solution that provides maximum comfortability while allowing travelers to pack and reach enough items for months on the road. We’ve created a state-of-the-art support system to keep your back straight and distribute the weight of the pack evenly onto your back and shoulders at all times.
The backpack contains a supportive metal plate that holds the padded back panel. This means that no matter what items are inside of your pack your back will always feel the padded straight back panel.

 
An Exterior Built to Last
Building a world-class exterior for our modern day community of adventurers was no simple task. We arrived at the perfect balance of visual appeal and functionality. Starting with a high-quality polyester fabric that is sure to make the backpack last for years and endure countless weather conditions around the world. 
On the other hand, we understood a simple but critical problem with current travel backpacks: All backpacks with enough room to fit ALL the items you'll need for a long adventure did not look good or had an opening at the top making your items inaccessible unless you removed all your items from the pack.
That is why we built this backpack with full carry-on suitcase style functionality. Meaning it will open 180 degrees flat across the backpack. Now there exists a travel backpack that works like a carry-on AND is capable of storing all the things you'll need on your next adventure. 



 
Material
Built with fully water-resistant polyester to make the backpack the perfect durable product for years of travel. Food and drinks will not stick to the fabric of the backpack.

Waist Straps
Gone are the days when you have to remove your backpack off your back to reach essentials like metro cards while in-transit. Our padded waist straps contain high-quality zippers that open a pocket to hold essentials.

Stash Pocket
Ever had to store certain items that you need to be hidden from the public eye? Your phone, passports, personal medicine? Our back panel is designed with a special pocket to be visible and accessible only to the traveler carrying the pack.


Charger Port
Our devices are important during our travels so now you may charge any device while in transit with our charging port built on the side of the backpack. Feel free to connect any portable battery to the port and place inside the pack.

 
Superior Carry-On Interior
The interior of the backpack features expansive technology that will expand the fabric of the pack as you fill the main compartment. Simply place all your belongings inside and the backpack will expand accordingly to its optimal size. 
We also equipped the backpack with highly functional compartments and features including an area to separate your dirty clothes or shoes, pockets for toiletries and essentials, and a compartment for your external battery.
Fully Carry-On Access - 180 Degree Main Compartment
The Lucky Backpack functions exactly as a carry-on suitcase because it opens completely 180 degrees. Lay the pack horizontally flat and pack all your things. The backpack will stretch proportionally to fit everything. Easily reach any of your items at all times.
 
Special Toiletry Pocket for Quick Access
Store any toiletry or health item in the special pocket designed for easy access right when opening the interior of the backpack.

Separate Your Dirty Clothes or Shoes from the Rest 
The dilemma of carrying around dirty clothes or shoes in our backpacks has long haunted millions of travelers. Now with the Lucky Backpack travelers have the ability to store any items separate from the rest in the special elastic compartment.

Essential Pockets and Battery Compartment
Mesh pockets on the inside of the backpack to store those items needed to reach on the go. Store and connect your external batter in the open mesh pocket on the inside.

 
Best in Class Safety Measures
When it comes to security, all external zippers feature our theft-proof lockable feature where you can slide any lock to secure your belongings. There’s also a safety whistle on the chest strap’s buckle to use at any moment to alert your surrounding. Our logo is also made from reflective fabric to light at night.



The Lucky Backpack Design - Built By Adventures for Adventures 
The journey started by taking a leap of faith when our founder Edgar decided to live abroad instead of taking a consulting job in New York City. From that moment, the Lucky Backpack community was being born. We grew into the hundreds and then thousands by visiting countless countries, meeting travelers around the world, but most importantly discovering the beautiful cultures in every corner of the globe.
From this experience, we learned all about the life and journey of thousands of travelers: Their glories, their struggles, their stories. We saw a large opportunity to create a product with them for the entire adventure community. 
Over the past 2 years, we captured pain points in hostels, airports, music festival, and many more places. We held critical focus groups with people from over 35 countries in person, online, and every other method in between. We arrived at the Lucky Backpack. By us for us. 

 
 

 


 


 

 


Growing up we never had the opportunity to travel or explore the world so the Lucky Backpack story all began with a decision to live abroad and travel the world before starting the corporate world after graduation. That experience over the last three years led us to meet thousands of people from around the world with beautiful cultures and precious traditions.
We were personally moved by the experiences we had that it changed our lives forever making us better individuals and opening our views to the effect that worldwide travel can have many seeking opportunities for a better life.
That is why we created Lucky Backpack, with the mission to provide products to allow anyone with the will to explore the world to do so regardless of their financial or demographic background.
Our backpack is built to function as a carry-on to solve the vast majority of problems of backpacking like removing back pain, storing dirty clothes, safety pockets, storing and retrieving essentials on the go,  all without having to shed out the premium price on the market.

<p>Capture Travel is a Dublin-based start-up company pioneered by Katie Doyle. Inspired by the missed opportunities for young adults visiting Europe, The Capture Travel Card is an initiative that brings them closer to unique opportunities offered by small businesses. </p>
<p>After living and working around Europe, Capture Travel's Katie Doyle (23) realized that city trips are often trails through historical monuments, overpriced restaurants and unoriginal encounters. Whereas, the real essence of a culture is not in its landmarks but in its businesses. It's sitting with a great coffee in a cafe window, observing Londoners go about their day-to-day life, it's eating dinner in an old train car in Amsterdam or a decadent restaurant in Paris, finding an amazing thrift shop in Edinburgh or having a cocktail in a converted market hall in Dublin.</p>

It's sitting with a great coffee in a cafe window, observing Londoners go about their day-to-day life, it's eating dinner in an old train car in Amsterdam or a decadent restaurant in Paris, finding an amazing thrift shop in Edinburgh or having a cocktail in a converted market hall in Dublin.
 

 
We want to change the way young adults see Europe by bringing them closer together with the real side of a city. At the same time, we'll be promoting small businesses that deserve to be recognized for their high quality products and services. 
 

 
I YOU I 
 
We market our card and the businesses involved to an array of young adult groups on social media primarily through Facebook, Instagram and Twitter (you might have seen us!). When we say 'young adults' we mean everybody from undergrads still at university, to graduates in the professional workplace: anyone who lives in, travels to or dreams of Europe.
Capture Travel is a young, vivacious start-up business that will endeavour to change the way we see European cities; not full of tourist attractions, but instead, filled with opportunities.  
We started this brand with you in mind. We want you to have real life experiences in Europe- meeting people of the same age, enjoying modern amenities and finding original adventures in the capitals.

<p>WHO IS LOUISE TRES? LOUISE IS A WONDERFUL LADY
OF THE SEA, A 43 FEET SAILING BOAT, BUILT IN 1988 BY
ELAN SHIPYARD IN SLOVENIA AND DESIGNED BY J &amp; J.
GREAT FOR CRUISING, COMFORTABLE 4 ROOMS AND 2
BATHROOMS, SPACIOUS DINETTE WITH A BIG TABLE
WHICH CAN HAVE 8 PEOPLE ON BOARD, TO 10
MAXIMUM; TWO FORWARD CABINS ARE BANK BEDS
WITH A COMMON BATH, TWO AFT CABINS ARE DOUBLE
BED, ONE HAS A LITTLE BAD FOR KID AND COMMON
BATH ASWELL.
</p>
<p>LOUISE SAILED IN DENMARK MOST OF HER LIFE THAN
WAS SELLED IN SPAIN AND THERE HAS BEEN
FORGOTTEN FOR A WHILE SINCE I BOUGHT IT FIXED A
BIT AND SAILED WITH TO ITALY. I'M GOING VERY SLOW
WITH THE REFIT DUE TO JOB, THAT WAS AROUND THE
WORLD IN THE LAST YEARS; DUE TO SPENT, WHICH
ARE TOO MUCH FOR ME AND OTHERS PRIORITY LIKE
FAMILY SPENT.
</p>
<p>RECENTLY I QUIT FROM MY JOB AS SAILOR/MEDIA
MANAGER ON MASERATI ITALIA 70; WORKING AS FREE-
LANCE PHOTOGRAPHER NOW, AND IN FREE TIME I
WANT TO FINISH THE JOBS ON LOUISE.
</p>
<p>THIS BOAT HAS A BIG POTENTIAL, CAN BE USED FOR
CRUISING AROUND WORLD, (HAS ALREADY SAILED
ATLANTIC OCEAN), CAN BE REALLY COMFORTABLE
AND EASY TO USE FOR SAILING SCHOOL; AND WHEN
WEATHERS CONDITION LOOK YOU ON THE DOCK CAN
BE NOT JUST A BOAT BNB, BUT A FUNNY PLACE FOR
SPECIAL DINNERS COOKED BY ME.
</p>
<p>LOUISE DECK NEED TO BE PAINTED, I ALREADY TOOK
OFF THE OLD TEAK WHICH WAS REALLY BAD, AND
</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>FILLED DECK; THE FINISHING WILL BE ANTI SKID. I'M
REPLACING NOW THE TEAK IN THE COOKPIT, I STARTED
NEW ELECTRICAL WIRING, PART OF MOTOR CHECK UP,
SEALING HATCHES, FIXING HAUL AND SEACOOKS.
</p>
<p>WE NEED NEW SAILS, INSTRUMENTS AND AUTO-PILOT
AND SOLAR PANEL. FRIDGE, AND HOT WATER BOILER
NEEDS WORK, HEOLIC GENERATOR TOO, MAYBE
REPLACED BY A HYDRO GENERATOR. WE HAVE
HEATERS IN ANY CABIN AND IN DINETTE, BUT
WEBASTO HEATING MOTOR NEED TO BE REPLACED.
</p>
<p>THE BOAT IS DOCKED IN ITALY, NEAR THE CAVE OF
WHITE MARBLE.<br/>
AS SOON SHE WILL BE READY, WILL START TO SAIL IN
MED SEA, ITALY, GREECE AND SPAIN. IN OCTOBER OF
THE SAME YEAR, WILL MOVE TO CANARY ISLANDS, SP,
IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, TO WAIT FOR RACE IN THE
ARC.
</p>
<p>(The ARC is a ‘must do’ for many sailors, and attracts over 200
boats and 1200 people every year to sail 2700 NM across the
Atlantic from Gran Canaria to Saint Lucia. The ARC is for
everyone; families with children, tough racers, cruising couples,
big boats and modest boats. Crossing the Atlantic together, but
having their own adventures. More than just a boat race, the ARC
is about friendships made ashore in the two weeks of pre-
departure activities continued over the radio net at sea. It’s about
arriving in Saint Lucia to be met on the dock with a rum punch
and a chilled beer, knowing you have achieved something
fantastic - crossing an ocean on a small sailboat).

SEA AND LEAVE IT ABOUT IN APRIL. FLORIDA CAN BE

Puedo hacer mucho trabajos, los últimos años he navegado con Maserati un VOR 70, alrededor de el mundo. Obtenemos varios récord de velocidad como la New York - San Francisco y la Cape2Rio. Tengo casi 100.000 millas náuticas en todos océanos. Esperando que con esto se sientan al seguro, les voy ofrecer para sus donaciones la posibilidad de llegar al barco donde quieren sin limitaciones en el tiempo.
