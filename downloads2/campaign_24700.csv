</p><p>Hi my name is Olivia; I am 15 years old and have been blessed
with the opportunity to dance since I was 7. Even before I started dancing I
imagined myself being a ballerina one day. I would walk around the house on my
toes, watch ballet movies, and make up choreography to music in my living room. I
think I wore out my VCR tape of “I wish I were a ballerina.” Many things satisfy
me in life but nothing quite like ballet. I dance because it makes me happy and
fulfills me like nothing else can. The way I feel when I dance it is my definition
of what true love is and where I feel closest to God. When I think of a day
where I am not able to dance anymore it breaks my heart. I can envision myself
as a very old woman still dancing in my pointe shoes. It may be only in my
dreams but I will be dancing. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/488426/files/20140406155937-BeachBallet.gif?1396825177"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>My Biggest Supporter</strong></p><p>My mom and dad got divorced when I was about 7. My mom
thought that my sister and I needed something to focus on, so she put my sister in ice
skating and I chose what I always dreamed of…ballet. I strongly believe that along with my faith, ballet
saved me. It was the brightest of lights at the end of my darkest tunnel. It
gave me something to look forward to everyday and showed me a love so rare I
can’t imagine it missing from my heart. I would have never started dancing if
my mom hadn’t encouraged me to take my first class, and I would definitely not
be dancing right now if it weren’t for her constant love, support, and
encouragement. I will never be able to
repay her for that. However, being a single mom with one income, the cost of my
monthly dance classes, pointe shoes, tights, leotards, etc. things have been
very far from easy to pay for. To be quite honest it has put a financial strain
on my family. My mom has given up so much for me to be able to live out my
passion. Being able to dance is a privilege and both my mom and I put in an
equal amount of effort to make it work. Although I do the actual work in class,
she gets me to dance classes, carpools my friends, pays for everything with the help of my grandma,
stays late and waits for me when we are in the theater, the list goes on and
on. Not to mention the fact the she works a full time job and 2 side jobs. She also
gives her time as the volunteer coordinator for our productions at my dance
studio. She does this because I am already away from home so much; if she is
with me at the studio it will give us more time together. Both of our lives are completely consumed by
my dancing.</p><p><em><br/></em></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/488297/files/20140406144206-editedDSC_0154.jpg?1396820526"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><strong>Senior Summer Intensive 2014 Texas</strong></p><p>To dance professionally is my dream.  And to reach this goal I have to look for

grow as well. This winter I applied to many summer dance intensive programs
throughout the country and although I received other offers I was blessed to be accepted into one of my top
choices. This Summer Intensive
program offers a 6-week session of study for serious students who are seeking a
professional dance career, like myself. This Intensive will give me a deeper understanding of ballet technique, 
focusing on pointe, variations, partnering and
repertoire. I am excited to have opportunity to take classes with well-established modern, jazz and
theatre dance teachers.

Although this is a financial hardship, it is a step I feel necessary to take
in order to become the dancer I am striving to be. My eyes are wide open to the fact that the ballet world is
very difficult and extremely competitive. It is never easy and will never be easy. There
is literally blood, sweat, and tears as well as daily aches and pains that get
put into what I do. But every blister, ache, and pain is worth the fullness of
my heart. It is the life that I have chosen and the only life I can imagine
myself living. Without dance life would feel pointeless! </p><p><em>Olivia's feet en pointe 2012</em></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/487624/files/20140406092035-DSC_0064.jpg?1396801235"" src="""" style=""width: 247.2px; height: 309px;""/></p>

minimize housing cost by me staying with them. I felt it was a great first time
away from the familiar and away from the help my mom offers me. I learned so much about myself during that
summer and I grew immensely as a dancer. It took me out of my comfort zone and opened
me up to new ideas. The teachers at my studio are wonderful but it is so
beneficial to seek out training from others who have had different experiences

Chloe does not want, the only thing that can make it better is an 
evening at Grandma’s. Tonight, Grandma has something special: a book 
that’s been hidden away in the attic gathering dust. Soon an epic 
adventure begins, involving a prince, a servant, three circus 
performers, a pirate, a fairy, a witch, and a dwarf.</p>
<p>Part action, part romance, part adventure, part comedy, <i>The Kingdom Next to Fid</i>
 spins a tale of devotion that soon has Grandma and Chloe burning 
through the chapters (and the cookies) to find out if undying love will 
triumph at the end. Sword fights, chases, war, betrayal, kidnapping, a 
magic inn, loyalty, heartache and friendship all mix with a little bit 
of sorcery and a lot of heart in this original fantasy. A whole new 
world awaits as the audience is transported from the Valley of the 
Wandering Willows to the Fen of Infinite Funk; from Raethein, to 
Graomar, to Draewen, to Fid; from the Cacophonous Pearl to the Forest of
 Chirping Crickets. Heck, there may even be a unicorn.</p>
<p>Supporting the main action are a dozen or so “background” players who
 go from soldier to knight to pirate to villager plus a “living set” 
manned by actors who not only fluidly change the scenery but 
literally make the magic happen. A unique experience for both the actors and audience. <br/></p>
<p><i>The Kingdom Next to Fid </i>will enchant adults while still being 
suitable for children 10 and up. Don’t miss the world premiere of this 
magical play by two of MuCCC’s own artists in residence, who clearly 
have too much time on their hands! It’s the greatest story you never 
heard of.</p><p></p><h3></h3><h3>The Cast</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/562199/files/20140506205224-Master.jpg?1399434744"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">The Playwrights </span><br/></p><p></p><i>The Kingdom Next to Fid</i> came to life because we wanted to tell an
 epic fantasy/fairy tale that would be appropriate for children while 
genuinely engaging and entertaining adults (there is, after all, a kid 
in all of us). We chose the genre because it allowed us to hit action, 
comedy, and drama all in one, plus we got to come up with some 
ridiculous location names like the Fen of Infinite Funk and the 
Cacophonous Pearl.  It also allows for us to do some pretty exciting things to push the community theatre envelope. After killing ourselves trying to find an old, public
 domain story we could adapt and finding only bits and pieces of plot

Chloe does not want, the only thing that can make it better is an 
evening at Grandma’s. Tonight, Grandma has something special: a book 
that’s been hidden away in the attic gathering dust. Soon an epic 
adventure begins, involving a prince, a servant, three circus 
performers, a pirate, a fairy, a witch, and a dwarf.
Part action, part romance, part adventure, part comedy, The Kingdom Next to Fid
 spins a tale of devotion that soon has Grandma and Chloe burning 
through the chapters (and the cookies) to find out if undying love will 
triumph at the end. Sword fights, chases, war, betrayal, kidnapping, a 
magic inn, loyalty, heartache and friendship all mix with a little bit 
of sorcery and a lot of heart in this original fantasy. A whole new 
world awaits as the audience is transported from the Valley of the 
Wandering Willows to the Fen of Infinite Funk; from Raethein, to 
Graomar, to Draewen, to Fid; from the Cacophonous Pearl to the Forest of
 Chirping Crickets. Heck, there may even be a unicorn.
Supporting the main action are a dozen or so “background” players who
 go from soldier to knight to pirate to villager plus a “living set” 
manned by actors who not only fluidly change the scenery but 
literally make the magic happen. A unique experience for both the actors and audience. 
The Kingdom Next to Fid will enchant adults while still being 
suitable for children 10 and up. Don’t miss the world premiere of this 
magical play by two of MuCCC’s own artists in residence, who clearly 
have too much time on their hands! It’s the greatest story you never 
heard of.The CastThe Playwrights The Kingdom Next to Fid came to life because we wanted to tell an
 epic fantasy/fairy tale that would be appropriate for children while 
genuinely engaging and entertaining adults (there is, after all, a kid 
in all of us). We chose the genre because it allowed us to hit action, 
comedy, and drama all in one, plus we got to come up with some 
ridiculous location names like the Fen of Infinite Funk and the 
Cacophonous Pearl.  It also allows for us to do some pretty exciting things to push the community theatre envelope. After killing ourselves trying to find an old, public
 domain story we could adapt and finding only bits and pieces of plot 
that we really liked, we finally went, ""Um, let's just write something
 ourselves."" So that's exactly what we did! ~Meredith & KarenBoth Meredith and Karen are Artist in Residence at MuCCC Theatre and accomplished performers in the Rochester Theatre Community. We Need Your Help!

</h3>
<p>My name is Daisy Jorgensen, and I have written a one act play, called Silent Wings.</p>
<p>The play is inspired by 'I Have Not Seen A Butterfly' around here - a published collection of artwork and poetry created by children living inside Terezin, a concentration camp set up by the SS during World War Two.</p>
<p>It all started as my final year dissertation submission whilst in training as an actor at The prestigious Guildford School of Acting. Then in 2013 I was kindly offered a platform to showcase a 20 minute excerpt of the piece by the 20:20 Vision Writing Festival. After seeing talented actors bring it to life, and generous audiences responding well, I went back to the script, and decided it had legs (maybe). After seeking advise from playwrights, theatre makers, and actors alike, running R&amp;D sessions and workshops, then editing and improving the script, the opportunity came along to stage the full length play for a two night run at the wonderful Burdall's Yard venue, as part of the Bath Fringe Festival 2016.</p>
<p>This is SO exciting, however like most creative opportunities, this one comes hand in hand with certain costs. Although much of the work so far has been self-funded, in order to allow the play to reach it's full potential, I have decided to set up this campaign to enable me, and the wonderful team working alongside me to deliver a more high quality peice to Bath theatre goers! </p>
<p>Any generous contributions will go directly back into the project, supporting the actors, director, musicians, technicians, and crew, all offering up their time to make my little vison a reality, alongside the creation of costumes, publicity, a set, and hopefully an enjoyable and reflective couple of evenings for our audience. </p>

<h3><u><strong>WHAT'S HAPPENING?</strong></u></h3>
<p>The Instigators are a troupe of dynamic actors who create stories that entertain and provoke audiences by embracing theater's potential as both an art and a sport. We are ambitiously moving forward by producing two plays in simultaneous rep at the Secret Theatre in LIC: <i>Hedda Gabler </i>by Ibsen and <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> by Wilde. Staged in the thrust, these shows immerse audiences into the theatrical world of each play. Our last production, Golden Boy by Clifford Odets, was described by Theater Pizzazz as ""striking, no-nonsense portrayal of a classic work"" by a ""heavy-hitting company of talented young artists.""**</p>
<h3><u><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</strong></u></h3>
<ul><li>Throw some $$$ our way!</li></ul>
<p><u><strong><i>​​</i></strong></u>The money we raise will go directly to renting The Secret Theatre, paying for rehearsal space, purchasing props and costumes, printing and distributing marketing materials, and compensating our designers, artists, and production team. Your financial support enables us to exist. All donations are deeply appreciated.</p>

The Instigators are a troupe of dynamic actors who create stories that entertain and provoke audiences by embracing theater's potential as both an art and a sport. We are ambitiously moving forward by producing two plays in simultaneous rep at the Secret Theatre in LIC: Hedda Gabler by Ibsen and The Importance of Being Earnest by Wilde. Staged in the thrust, these shows immerse audiences into the theatrical world of each play. Our last production, Golden Boy by Clifford Odets, was described by Theater Pizzazz as ""striking, no-nonsense portrayal of a classic work"" by a ""heavy-hitting company of talented young artists.""**
HOW CAN YOU HELP?
Throw some $$$ our way!
​​The money we raise will go directly to renting The Secret Theatre, paying for rehearsal space, purchasing props and costumes, printing and distributing marketing materials, and compensating our designers, artists, and production team. Your financial support enables us to exist. All donations are deeply appreciated.
Spread the word!
We need butts in seats. Buy your tickets here: http://instigatorsnyc.brownpapertickets.com/

<h3>HELLO!!</h3>
<p>My name is Alden Adair, I’m the producer and director behind Queen Henriette. As an actor’s life “ebb’s and flows like the moon” its important to have self-created work to keep in practice. Queen Henriette began as a need to create and work at a time when I wasn’t working in my artistic field. Over the past two years, this show has changed its form as I searched for what this story could say about today’s social climate.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Queen Henriette explores gender and the social expectations of women and men within the framework of an adapted King Henry IV pt. I by William Shakespeare. Language is mutable: words and language used in different situations have different meanings and weight. Shakespeare is a master at using language to play with meaning. So what would happen when women stepped into these roles originally designed for men? How does the existing language inform their experience? What text remains the same, and what needs to change to suit our adaption? How does a person’s social image affect their actions? How are they treated differently if they fall within or outside of the social norms? These are some themes we are eager to explore in this great play.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<h3>NEEDS</h3>
<p>Funds raised will be going to three areas. <strong><i>Space. Bells. Desk.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Space</i></strong> is what we need to move and breath. We need a place to rehearse, to speak, to fight, to get it wrong, and then get it right. Then we need a space to present. A space where the artists and community come together to share the experience of this event.</p>
<p>-Rehearsal space</p>
<p>-Performance space</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Bells</strong></i> is everything that makes our senses jingle jangle, from our eyes to our ears. This includes costume pieces, and music. Production value is what some call it, I prefer bells. </p>
<p>-Costumes</p>
<p>-Sound and Music Design</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Desk</strong></i> is about the paper work. While this is an artistic venture, we need to do a lot of administrative work to get the production running. We need to protect our artists, ourselves and our renting partners. We need the up front cash to promote our show, otherwise you’re the only one who’s gonna hear about it ;) We also need lots of paper and ink as we make our cuts and edits.</p>
<p>-Administration </p>
<p>-Insurance Costs</p>
<p>-Publicity, Posters, Bills</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>IMPACT</h3>
<p>Actors need to act. That’s how they grow. Putting an artist onstage makes them stronger, and the stronger they are, the greater the collective artistic wealth becomes. Actors need to act. So women need to play more roles that are more diverse, and different from what they commonly have access to. This show will give some fantastic women the opportunity to explore “an undiscovered country” of character that they have yet to have chance to explore. Actors need to act. For artists from outside of Ontario, the move to Toronto can be a hard challenge, and the opportunity to perform onstage in Toronto can be scarce. We have a predominantly Saskatchewan cast and production team, and this show will give some of these artists their first time to perform onstage in this great city.</p>
<p>But more than the artists, having a space where people can experience and SEE women in places of power and influence adds to the movement of equality within our City and our Country. </p>

<br/>Our Initiative

All ticket proceeds from the event will be donated to support a local charity dedicated to providing a safe space for members of the LGBTQ Community. Help us bring Snow Queen to life by funding this project and supporting the initiative behind it!</p>

<p><strong><em>""LINE 0""</em></strong> by EstadoFlotante is a dance performance that explores different human connections through the concept of energy transformation, using a dynamic and intense physicality. Energy has the characteristic of traveling through the body, the objects, and the space; therefore, this transformation also influences the environment and the atmosphere.

<p><em>I started this process in 2013 where I tried the central ideas of this work, My intention was to develop a dance from physical reaction, in a way that we discover the piece each time it is performed. Now after almost two years I restart the process with a completely different group of dancers and collaborating with a costume designer and a music composer; we get to complete the work and discover new things each time. It doesn't stop surprising me all the mystery hidden that a group, a dancer, a movement, and a performance situation can reveal.</em></p>

<p><strong>Can you spare $25 for the sake of art?!</strong></p>
<p>Modern Times Stage Company in association with Crow’s Theatre presents Russian playwright Anton Chekhov's <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> during the period of March 26 to April 13, 2019 in Toronto.  I have been really taken by the work of Soheil Parsa over the years and therefore wanted to reach out to some of my closest friends, family and/or likeminded creative aesthetes! - to assist in raising additional resources for this upcoming spectacular production!</p>
<p>It is a large-scale production and is going to need more money than it currently has to support a 10 + cast! <strong><u>My goal is to raise $5000 and thus am reaching out to a select group hoping that if each person can donate $25 I will reach my goal!</u></strong></p>
<p>All money raised will go directly to production costs and you will receive a tax receipt for your donation. It would be incredible if you can help out here and of course -  hope to see you at the show as well!</p>
<p><strong>MORE ABOUT THE SHOW</strong></p>
<p><i>The Cherry Orchard</i> has been described as ""a theatre poem of the suffering of change"" or a poem about life and death, transition and change. The Cherry Orchard unearths and explores the human comedy in the most tragic conditions. It is a comedy of life, with characters who are simultaneously ridiculous and touching. Modern Times' simple, imagistic and minimalist approach offers a new look into this timeless classical masterpiece. In a production filled with vitality, intimacy, poetry and fluidity, director Soheil Parsa explores the human capacity for self-destruction and self-deception, the mystery of life, loss of values, human loneliness and the inability of people to comprehend the world in which they live.</p>

<p>That’s right, inspiration can come from anywhere. It was a bar graph of stock performance throughout the year and at the bottom of each bar was the first letter of each month. I couldn’t help noticing that the months July through November spell out J.A.S.O.N. and an idea was born.</p>
<p>What story could I tell in five scenes taking place over those five months? Maybe it’s the Greek in me, but I knew that it would have to involve that legendary leader of the Argonauts in the quest for the Golden Fleece - but how to make it work?</p>
<p>It was a short leap from a mythical band of heroes to a one-hit-wonder band of Punk Rockers and their biggest fan, a groupie named Medea. Still, there was the Golden Fleece to consider. What could stand in for such an iconic object as that? Then, it struck me:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""I'm a really good girl!  I don't even have a traffic ticket!""  That's the note I sent to the house mother of The Rehearsal Club back in 1970.  I got a cot in a room with 4 other young women -- all of us pursuing a dream in the theater.  Two weeks later I was on Broadway, met my husband of 40 years and, here I am, trying to help ""preserve the name of The Rehearsal Club, tell its story and inspire future generations.""  That's our Mission Statement.</p>
<p>Now?  The site of our lovely home is now a vacant lot.  We, the women of The Rehearsal Club, are heightening the awareness for the City of New York to understand how very important that dilapidated, old brownstone was to the many young professionals trying to stay in New York and get a foothold in one of its most challenging professions.</p>
<ul>
<li>July 1, 2013 is our Centennial</li>
<li>Women from all over the country are coming to renew friendships.</li>
<li>Our collaboration has inspired a documentary, a book and a new musical.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the women of the RC were born with a financial cushion.  All we had were big dreams.  Some of us achieved fame -- like Carol Burnett &amp; Blythe Danner -- many of us had our 15 minutes on Broadway, film and TV.  Me?  You may remember me as ""Katie Parker"" on The Guiding Light, but like The Rehearsal Club, that's gone too except in hearts of our many fans.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All funding is TAX-DEDUCTIBLE.  We're setting a first goal of $5,000 which will primarily fund The Players Club space and catering for other ""free"" spaces donated by the Museum of Modern Art and the Erarta New York Gallery.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
""I'm a really good girl!  I don't even have a traffic ticket!""  That's the note I sent to the house mother of The Rehearsal Club back in 1970.  I got a cot in a room with 4 other young women -- all of us pursuing a dream in the theater.  Two weeks later I was on Broadway, met my husband of 40 years and, here I am, trying to help ""preserve the name of The Rehearsal Club, tell its story and inspire future generations.""  That's our Mission Statement.
Now?  The site of our lovely home is now a vacant lot.  We, the women of The Rehearsal Club, are heightening the awareness for the City of New York to understand how very important that dilapidated, old brownstone was to the many young professionals trying to stay in New York and get a foothold in one of its most challenging professions.

July 1, 2013 is our Centennial
Women from all over the country are coming to renew friendships.
Our collaboration has inspired a documentary, a book and a new musical.

None of the women of the RC were born with a financial cushion.  All we had were big dreams.  Some of us achieved fame -- like Carol Burnett & Blythe Danner -- many of us had our 15 minutes on Broadway, film and TV.  Me?  You may remember me as ""Katie Parker"" on The Guiding Light, but like The Rehearsal Club, that's gone too except in hearts of our many fans.


What We Need & What You Get
All funding is TAX-DEDUCTIBLE.  We're setting a first goal of $5,000 which will primarily fund The Players Club space and catering for other ""free"" spaces donated by the Museum of Modern Art and the Erarta New York Gallery.
We are ALSO taking seed money from anyone who would like to target the development of the new musical, ""Good Girls Only,"" currently in development.  A staged reading is set for March 13, 2013 in New York with a stellar Broadway cast.

Some events are open to the public - like the Lincoln Center Library presentation on June 27, 2013.
$1,000 donors, however, will get a seat at our exclusive Players Club Dinner and get a chance to mix and mingle with the stars!
Other donors will receive our exclusive merchandise (while supplies last).
Large Donors (potential producers) to the musical will be invited to the first presentation.


The Impact
The women of the Rehearsal Club represent collaboration and support.  That first job I got on Broadway?  One of the RC girls coached me on my song for the call back.  The rest of my Cinderella life is history.

This Centennial is NOT just a ""reunion."" 
We will be spotlighting attention on the need for affordable arts housing in New York.
This Centennial will also debut the collaborative efforts of the alum through the documentary trailer, the book and the new musical.

<h3><u>The Teeth of Haros</u></h3>
<ul><li>Cowards and Kings is a new theatre company founded by young aspiring theatre makers Joshua MacGregor and Chomba Taulo, actors-in-training who have a strong passion for theatre and new writing. Josh's rich history in dance and creative writing have allowed him to create characters who are living, breathing, and can inhabit the theatre space. Chomba's extensive knowledge of acting theory, hunger to always learn more, and eagerness to explore the arts make him a driving force of positive change in the world and the perfect man to be directing the company's first play.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>As theatre practitioners, we believe that the Edinburgh Fringe is the ideal stage for upcoming companies to create and present new work, and would be an invaluable opportunity for us to learn more about our craft and to come into contact with our fellows, the next generation of theatre makers.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Making it to this festival will go a long way to launching our emerging theatre company out into the world. Doing so with minimal financial strain will allow us to place all our efforts into creating a piece of work that is sophisticated, powerful, and meaningful to today's society. The closer we get to our goal, the easier it will be to make this possible and continue our work in future years. </li></ul>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
During the summer of 2007 several students at The Columbus Academy formed Shots in the Dark Independent Theatre Company to provide performance opportunities for students not getting the chance to perform. The Columbus Academy graciously allowed us to perform in their theater. Our first production, <em>The Long Red Herring</em>, turned out to be a greater success than expected. We used the donations from the show to grow. We formed working relationships with Parks and Recreations Departments and other community theaters to perform in some of the most beautiful theatre spaces in Central Ohio. We celebrated our fifth anniversary season with an expanded production schedule including our inaugural winter season. Starting with this past season Shots in the Dark shifted focus to producing new work, work new to Columbus, or work rarely produced in Columbus. This past summer, operating under this philosophy, we produced three new plays including the award-winning shows ""Swing of the Sea"" and ""Lunch Lady: Tater Tots of Love"" which played a sold-out run. We earned 19 BroadwayWorld Columbus award nominations, and won 9! We are in the process of obtaining our non-profit 501(c)3 status so patrons can enjoy the tax benefits of sponsoring a non-profit corporation. As a non-profit, professional theatre company, Shots in the Dark continues to rely on sponsorships and donations for our continued success. </div>

<div><h3>Presented by Generic Ensemble Company in Partnership with The VORTEX<br/>in conjunction with LuckyChaos</h3></div>

<p><b><i>The Mikado:
Reclaimed </i></b>flips the Gilbert and
Sullivan classic on its head, presenting an (almost) all-Asian American cast
performing a devised theatre piece with select musical numbers from the
(in)famous operetta. Set in an internment camp in the near future, internees
seek humanity amidst racism, corruption, and xenophobia. Queer love stories
mingle with examinations of yellowface and conflict as we reinvent the
well-known characters of Yum-Yum, Nanki-poo, and Ko-Ko.   </p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>Why This Project Now</h3>
<p>In a political climate of over-crowded immigrant detention centers, calls for “Muslim Bans,” and the largest refugee crisis in decades, <b><i>The Mikado: Reclaimed</i></b> explores human resilience and liberation in the face of real and metaphorical confinement. We are devising our piece based on research of Japanese American internment during World War II, Syrian refugee camps, and family detention centers.</p>
<h3>How We Will Use These Funds</h3>
<p>Donations from this campaign will go directly toward paying creative collaborators, that include seven actors, a director, video director and crew, music director, a stage manager, four designers and other personnel. We have already received a grant from the City of Austin, which will cover much of our talent and materials costs. We are grateful to The VORTEX for underwriting our project through providing performance space and other material goods so we can direct most of our resources toward paying talent. It is our goal to pay each actor at least $500. The $3000 will insure that. It is the goal of the Generic Ensemble Company to make creative labor sustainable for all collaborators. Love makes art good, but you can't eat it. Money helps.</p>
<h3>Let's Talk About <i>Radical Rush</i>
</h3>
<p>We are so proud to be partnering with The VORTEX on their Radical Rush program that reserves a bloc of <b>free tickets</b> in the spirit of sustainability, accessibility, and participating in the gift economy. Radical Rush tickets are released an hour before the performance starts--first come first serve. Your donation to this campaign allows us to offer our show to all patrons, regardless of their socio-economic status. </p>
<h3>Why We Are So Cool</h3>
<p>The Generic Ensemble Company (GenEnCo) is one of the few troupes in Austin, and nationally, that centers people of color bodies and experiences in physically engaged, experimental, ensemble-based performance. GenEnCo has some grants and awards under its belt, and director, kt shorb, has presented work nationally. This is the most recent project aimed at asking profound questions toward social change through rigorous, dangerous, and community-conscious theatre. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot help out with donating to our cause, we are looking for volunteers to run the house, be backstage, and distribute media material. Do you have a blog, radio show, or column? Talk to us and share our project with your audience!</p>

We put on two shows per year which all raise money for a local charity. In the past we have raised money for the <b><a href=""http://www.kab.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kent Association for the Blind</a>, <a href=""http://www.catchinglives.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Catching Lives</a>, <a href=""http://www.battleofbritainmemorial.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Battle of Britain Memorial</a> and <a href=""http://www.ageuk.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AgeUK</a></b>. We are a relatively new and small amateur dramatics group but are continually growing.</p>
<p>This October we will be back at the <b><a href=""http://www.thegulbenkian.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gulbenkian</a></b> in Canterbury with <b>Jane Austen's 'Pride &amp; Prejudice,'</b> adapted for the stage and directed by our very own Leila Sangtabi.</p>
<p>Due to unforeseen circumstances, the players are in need of a little financial help to make sure that Pride &amp; Prejudice is the best it can be and that's where you come in! Your generous donations not only mean that you can grab some great exclusive experiences and goodies but also help us to put on a great show for you all and more importantly, raise as much money as possible for this production's chosen charity - the <b>Kent MS Therapy Centre.</b></p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://kentmstc.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Kent MS Therapy Centre</a></strong> offers first class facilities to support people affected by Multiple Sclerosis – those that have the condition, their families, friends and those who care for them. Some of our members have been affected by Multiple Sclerosis and so this charity is close to their hearts. <b>Multiple Sclerosis (MS)</b> is a disease of the central nervous system, which is often progressive. At present it remains incurable.</p>
<p><b>Tickets are on sale now from the <a href=""https://uk.patronbase.com/_Gulbenkian/Productions/BRZ/Performances"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gulbenkian website </a>and in person at the box office! Grab yours today before they're gone!</b></p>

<h3>About the Production</h3>
<p>This tale of love and values unfolds in class-conscious England in the late 18th century. The five Bennet sisters - including strong-willed Elizabeth - have been raised by their mother with one purpose in life: finding a husband. When the wealthy bachelor, Mr Bingley, takes up residence in nearby Netherfield, the Bennets are abuzz. Amongst Bingley’s sophisticated circle of friends, surely there will be no shortage of suitors for the Bennet sisters. But when Elizabeth meets up with the handsome and - it would seem - snobbish Mr. Darcy, the battle of the sexes begins.</p>
<p>This production has been adapted for the stage and directed by <b><a href=""http://www.leilasangtabiproductions.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Leila Sangtabi</a>. </b>The original artwork for the poster was created by Assistant Director <b>Corinne Smallman</b> and film composer <a href=""http://www.chiarafulgoni.com/#!about/c2414"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Chiara Fulgoni</b></a> has composed original music for the show. Expect real regency dancing from Jane Austen's era taught to us by <a href=""http://www.contrafusion.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">John at ContraFusion</a> as well as beautiful costumes, set and heartwarming performances from our fabulous (if rather enormous) cast.</p>
<p>Previous productions from the University of Kent Players include Comic Potential, Cash on Delivery, A Murder is Announced, Flare Path and Murder Inn.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>This production is our most ambitious production to date and is already in full swing with tickets on sale now. Any donations we receive will be much appreciated and as so, we do not have a specific target amount but would like to raise around £700 to cover all of our costs in the run up to opening night. We will then be able to donate a larger amount of ticket sale profit to our charity.</p>
<p>In return, apart from our expressed gratitude you can grab yourself some great goodies and experiences only available to our Indiegogo backers including Mr Darcy's backstage tour, Lizzie's regency dance class, goody bags and more!</p>
<p>Your donations will go towards the building of our fantastic set designed by Neil Hornsey and the creation of some beautiful costumes.</p>
</div><div>

We are a relatively new and small amateur dramatics group but are continually growing.
This October we will be back at the Gulbenkian in Canterbury with Jane Austen's 'Pride & Prejudice,' adapted for the stage and directed by our very own Leila Sangtabi.
Due to unforeseen circumstances, the players are in need of a little financial help to make sure that Pride & Prejudice is the best it can be and that's where you come in! Your generous donations not only mean that you can grab some great exclusive experiences and goodies but also help us to put on a great show for you all and more importantly, raise as much money as possible for this production's chosen charity - the Kent MS Therapy Centre.
The Kent MS Therapy Centre offers first class facilities to support people affected by Multiple Sclerosis – those that have the condition, their families, friends and those who care for them. Some of our members have been affected by Multiple Sclerosis and so this charity is close to their hearts. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system, which is often progressive. At present it remains incurable.
Tickets are on sale now from the Gulbenkian website and in person at the box office! Grab yours today before they're gone!

About the Production
This tale of love and values unfolds in class-conscious England in the late 18th century. The five Bennet sisters - including strong-willed Elizabeth - have been raised by their mother with one purpose in life: finding a husband. When the wealthy bachelor, Mr Bingley, takes up residence in nearby Netherfield, the Bennets are abuzz. Amongst Bingley’s sophisticated circle of friends, surely there will be no shortage of suitors for the Bennet sisters. But when Elizabeth meets up with the handsome and - it would seem - snobbish Mr. Darcy, the battle of the sexes begins.
This production has been adapted for the stage and directed by Leila Sangtabi. The original artwork for the poster was created by Assistant Director Corinne Smallman and film composer Chiara Fulgoni has composed original music for the show. Expect real regency dancing from Jane Austen's era taught to us by John at ContraFusion as well as beautiful costumes, set and heartwarming performances from our fabulous (if rather enormous) cast.
Previous productions from the University of Kent Players include Comic Potential, Cash on Delivery, A Murder is Announced, Flare Path and Murder Inn.   What We Need & What You Get This production is our most ambitious production to date and is already in full swing with tickets on sale now. Any donations we receive will be much appreciated and as so, we do not have a specific target amount but would like to raise around £700 to cover all of our costs in the run up to opening night. We will then be able to donate a larger amount of ticket sale profit to our charity.
In return, apart from our expressed gratitude you can grab yourself some great goodies and experiences only available to our Indiegogo backers including Mr Darcy's backstage tour, Lizzie's regency dance class, goody bags and more!
Your donations will go towards the building of our fantastic set designed by Neil Hornsey and the creation of some beautiful costumes.

    Other Ways You Can Help If you are unable to back us then don't worry, there are other ways you could help us to get to our target. Please share our campaign far and wide and tell all of your friends about the production! You can also grab some tickets from the Gulbenkian and come down to support us during our three night run.

<p><b></b></p><h3><b>What Third Side On The Road Is About</b></h3><p></p>
<p><b><i>The Third Side</i></b> is a new dance work I am creating for inclusion in dance Immersion's<i> <b>Queen's Calling Choreographers' Showcase</b> scheduled for February 6-</i>8, 2015 in Toronto. We need your help in making this a success.</p>
<p>I am Artistic Director of A Company of Dancers (ACOD), a federally tax exempt organization based in Detroit, MI. ACOD currently uses 6 dancers although we've had a roster of as many as 12. Our number of dancers depends on the dance pieces being performed. </p>
<p>Personally, I am a performing artist who works in more than one genre of the arts. I have received grants for creating a number of multidisciplinary works using artwork, music, film projection and, of course, movement. I am an Assistant Professor of Dance and for the last two years been a Master Teacher affiliated with Michigan State University's Michigan Museum's Michigan Traditional Arts Apprenticeship Program. In 2012 I was given the Heritage Award in the Performing Arts. In 2008 I was ArtServe Michigan (now the Creative Many) Arts Educator of the Year.</p>
<p>I created a poster to represent our project. This poster, also, speaks to the unique voice within the piece. Titled from lines written by Stirling Silliphant, the piece explores all kinds of social dance for the stage as elements integral to the development of this contemporary ballet. It is, also, a world premiere filled with emotive call-and-response voicings that looks at the sensibilities of the personalities within it. It is an abstract mélange, which uses social dance steps of the 20th century, ballet and contemporary/modern dance to look at three sides of a coin – the voices of mother, daughter and abductor.</p>
<p>Although based on the abduction of the Nigerian schoolgirls in 2014 the topic has more universal issues within it that can resonate in any community. I feel strongly that the loss of a child, the violation of the sanctity of one's home, domestic terrorism can certainly be found in any community. Predators, theives and gangs live somewhere near you. As the only American choreographer invited to present I feel strongly that coming from Detroit, MI USA allows me to apply an urban outlook.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Budget and Investor Perks</h3> <p>I am asking for $3500 to make this dance a reality. Our expenses include - <span><br/></span>studio rental for rehearsals <br/>costumes <br/>travel to and from Toronto <br/>accommodations while in Toronto <br/>per diem for the dancers (food and incidentals while away) <br/>stipends for the dancers <br/>a stipend for the choreographer </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary This one-act new play by Lucia Cox completes The WInged Trilogy (Dawn Chorus, Blackbird). It is based on English Folk stories, fairy tales and folk songs. 
It is the story of an adopted daughter (Cuckoo) who is left to nurse a broken-hearted mother to her grave. Once gone, her biological daughters come home to claim their inheritance with dire consequences and disturbing truths about their past.
Told using original folk music, traditional songs and folk dance, the piece will be performed at Salford City Council gem, Ordsall Hall.
There will be a local community choir and we have a partnership with MMU Fashion department with 2nd year students designing and making the costume.
Reaching audiences who do not normally engage with theatre and to offer professional development to young creatives is at the heart of House of Orphans ethos and goal. 
We are committed to making work in the NW but have also toured to London's Cockpit Theatre and to 59E59 in New York (One Hand Clapping, 2015). We hope to take Cuckoo on the road after its premiere in Salford.

<p>Twelfth Night is Shakespeare's romantic comedy, but there is more to it than just that. The clever bard wrote a script for the festivities on the twelfth night holiday that is all about rabblerousing. The script definitely embodies the holiday as it has lots of  having fun, gender switching, foolery, and he even slipped in some jokes poking fun at himself. However, his cleverness didn't stop there, he dropped in some ideas about gender and the role gender plays in love as well as some interesting viewpoints on what  love means to each person.  Which is why I chose this play, we get to indulge in the language and the comedy but it also has some points that still pertain to the modern community. </p>
<p>That being said I wanted to stage Twelfth Night in an outdoor urban park or garden setting. As our set designer Kari Warfield says ""Shakespeare's outdoors is a place anything can happen. In the comedy where
just about everything does happen, filling a black box with as much green as
possible is a necessity."" That is exactly what this campaign is about, building a park indoors. This garden will host
some of the staples of The Globe including three separate entrances, a
trapdoor, and our interpretation of a balcony. A wood within a neighborhood
nestled somewhere between Wicker Park and Bucktown allows us plenty of
opportunity for plots to unravel.</p>

the audience can become fully immersed in the play. With your contributions we
can create a place separate from the concrete jungle, a place secluded from the
garish light of day, love can blossom, fail, and twist perceptions. Hope can be

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>While growing up I had a Reader’s Digest book titled “Laughter
is the Best Medicine.” This is an idea that I believe in wholeheartedly. In
today’s world we a constantly bombarded by struggling economy, war in the
middle east, and the everyday stresses of life in a busy world. I strive to
give to the community a place where they can let the cares and stresses of the
world slip away and lose themselves in the fun and frivolity of comedic entertainment.
By helping us we can in turn help the community by hopefully taking some of the
stress away. I believe in community and everyone getting together not just for
a cause but for a shared experience. </p>
<p>You should take a moment to check out what we did last year
with Harry Kurnitz’s “A Shot in the Dark”</p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shakespeare is a classic and bringing classics back to life
is a challenge. Fist we have the language. They spoke like this to each other
back then but we have digressed to a much less formal way of speaking. This is
a definite challenge to step up to as we have to use the language and make its intention
clear to the audience. We are also modernizing a classic there is risk in discrepancies
from old to new and things we no longer use like swords. Being a classic it has
been done many times over and will people come see something that they have
seen before? That means that we cannot just have an average show. With your
help here we can bring that bar higher with a great set.</p>
Luckily I have put together an amazing team of
people the work on this project with a shared vision. We have a talented cast
of twelve eager people ready and willing to take on Shakespeare. Plus a great
crew of artists ready to get to work vigilantly on the set. And of course the
help of my beautiful partner in life Kari Warfield and her set design, script
work, and acting.  <p> </p>

world slip away and lose themselves in the fun and frivolity of comedic entertainment.
By helping us we can in turn help the community by hopefully taking some of the
stress away. I believe in community and everyone getting together not just for
a cause but for a shared experience.

  Risks & Challenges


Shakespeare is a classic and bringing classics back to life
is a challenge. Fist we have the language. They spoke like this to each other
back then but we have digressed to a much less formal way of speaking. This is
a definite challenge to step up to as we have to use the language and make its intention
clear to the audience. We are also modernizing a classic there is risk in discrepancies
from old to new and things we no longer use like swords. Being a classic it has
been done many times over and will people come see something that they have
seen before? That means that we cannot just have an average show. With your
help here we can bring that bar higher with a great set.
Luckily I have put together an amazing team of
people the work on this project with a shared vision. We have a talented cast
of twelve eager people ready and willing to take on Shakespeare. Plus a great
crew of artists ready to get to work vigilantly on the set. And of course the
help of my beautiful partner in life Kari Warfield and her set design, script
work, and acting.   
  Other Ways You Can Help 

Times are tough and I understand that not everyone can
contribute. You can still help out by sharing. Send this out to all your
friends however you can.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p> <p>Hello! Welcome to the Indiegogo campaign for Quantum Dragon Theatre.</p>
<p><b>What's This About:</b> We believe that science fiction (and fantasy, and post-apocalyptic wastelands, techno-dystopias, steampunk utopias, time travel paradoxes, superheroes, Lovecraftian horror, and everything in between) is awesome. We also believe that live theatre is awesome. Quantum Dragon is about taking these awesome things and merging them together.<br/><br/><b>Who Are We:</b> We are the San Francisco Bay Area's first and only speculative-fiction-centric theatre company. We love these kinds of stories, but they are almost never to be seen on stage - we exist to solve this problem. Don't expect to see any Shakespeare or Ibsen here: we're focused on original works, rarely performed genre plays, and adaptations of your favorite stories and novels. That's just how we roll. <br/><br/><b>Our Promise:</b> We will never let off the gas, rest on our laurels, or dabble in the mundane. Always expect the unexpected. By pushing the boundaries of the theatre and telling these new types of stories, we hope to fascinate, entertain, and maybe (just maybe) learn a little more about what it means to live in this crazy reality of ours.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why Indiegogo:</b> We've got a great line-up of three plays which we intend to present over the course of 2016. They run the gamut from cerebral to emotional, dystopian to lighthearted, near-realistic to wildly conceptual. They all focus on fascinating characters trying to cope with the worlds in which they live. We're excited to show them to you. </p>
<p>But to make this season happen, we're going to need your help. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Our First Season</h3>

Chi
Siamo?

QuindiQuando
presenta il progetto MiiM, pensato e sviluppato grazie alla
collaborazione con la realtà milanese d’improvvisazione teatrale
Teatribù. QuindiQuando è una noprofit culturale che opera sul
territorio milanese da quattro anni per la promozione dell’Arte e
della Cultura. La nostra associazione ha prodotto e/o partecipato
attivamente alla realizzazione di eventi di spicco nel panorama

andiamo più fieri è proprio quella con Teatribù.          Qual è
il nostro progetto?

lancia il progetto MiiM come una grande scommessa, una sfida, una
provocazione: Milano ha bisogno di improvvisare.

All’interno

generation wrestles with the emotional and spiritual effects of the Holocaust
through the stories of those who lived through it. The ASH Project takes the
2013 concert dance piece and expands upon the striking narrative, the visceral
punch of film, and the dense emotional rawness and physical exertion this
intimate work entails to create a captivating art film exploring a young
generation's reaction to human suffering. ASH chases after one of the most
vulnerable human conditions – the question of profound loss – through stress
and struggle as it melts to the edges of the spirit.</span></span></p>

the Holocaust and other great human tragedies to abstract the process of human
suffering, weaving a story that follows one woman’s struggle to come to terms
with the suffering that surrounds her. We walk with her as her world is torn
apart, and we enter her mind and heart as she struggles in a post WWII
landscape that seems absent of God or purity. Like many great tragedies, there
is no resolution, no answer to be had, just a question that continues in
perpetuity; the question of what our actions says about who we are as a people.</span></span></p>

through a narrative of dehumanization and redemption, portraying the
dichotomies of human and animal, light and dark, presenting body and spirit as
both bound and free as they explore a deep visceral struggle in the throes of
the poignant musical scores of Arvo Pärt, Chopin, Hauschka, Glenn Gould, and
Alva Noto. ASH is a statement on the collective heart and the ache that is born
within it. Through reflections of vulnerability, desperation, resilience,
bravery, loss, and above all, hope, we bring into focus beauty and truth in the
midst of destruction. It is, at its core, the story of humanity, stripped of
artifice and raw in its primal emotions.</span></span></p>

haunting, deserted industrial landscape that can provide, better than any set,
the perfect backdrop for the spiritual desolation evoked in the piece. In such
an environment, film allows us to take ten steps back from the stage, and
perceive the dance within a larger, palpably real setting. It allows beams of
sunlight and steel, and dust hanging illuminated in the air to come between the
viewer and the dancers, heightening the reality of the experiences portrayed,
the subtle movements of fingers, facial expressions of vulnerability and hope,

of film would allow us to fill in the necessary background - the cultural and
political climate, the religious, personal and social implications - that I

<p></p></div>","Welcome to The ASH Project! 
WHAT IS ASH? 
ASH is a concert dance piece that explores how our young
generation wrestles with the emotional and spiritual effects of the Holocaust
through the stories of those who lived through it. The ASH Project takes the
2013 concert dance piece and expands upon the striking narrative, the visceral
punch of film, and the dense emotional rawness and physical exertion this
intimate work entails to create a captivating art film exploring a young
generation's reaction to human suffering. ASH chases after one of the most
vulnerable human conditions – the question of profound loss – through stress
and struggle as it melts to the edges of the spirit.
 ASH draws upon art, religion, ritual, and stories from
the Holocaust and other great human tragedies to abstract the process of human
suffering, weaving a story that follows one woman’s struggle to come to terms
with the suffering that surrounds her. We walk with her as her world is torn
apart, and we enter her mind and heart as she struggles in a post WWII
landscape that seems absent of God or purity. Like many great tragedies, there
is no resolution, no answer to be had, just a question that continues in
perpetuity; the question of what our actions says about who we are as a people.
  The powerful choreography of ASH leads the dancers
through a narrative of dehumanization and redemption, portraying the
dichotomies of human and animal, light and dark, presenting body and spirit as
both bound and free as they explore a deep visceral struggle in the throes of
the poignant musical scores of Arvo Pärt, Chopin, Hauschka, Glenn Gould, and
Alva Noto. ASH is a statement on the collective heart and the ache that is born
within it. Through reflections of vulnerability, desperation, resilience,
bravery, loss, and above all, hope, we bring into focus beauty and truth in the
midst of destruction. It is, at its core, the story of humanity, stripped of
artifice and raw in its primal emotions.
 Filming will take place at the Albuquerque Railyard - a
haunting, deserted industrial landscape that can provide, better than any set,
the perfect backdrop for the spiritual desolation evoked in the piece. In such
an environment, film allows us to take ten steps back from the stage, and
perceive the dance within a larger, palpably real setting. It allows beams of
sunlight and steel, and dust hanging illuminated in the air to come between the
viewer and the dancers, heightening the reality of the experiences portrayed,
the subtle movements of fingers, facial expressions of vulnerability and hope,
the dirt under the fingernails, and the stained skin.
   The purpose of the ASH Project is to create a 40-minute
film from the concert dance piece, incorporating new choreography, dynamic
setting, and all that film has to offer to the telling of a story. Our hope is
that we can share this art with a young generation of students and artists to
show the importance of trying to connect to events like the Holocaust. Bridging
the gap and carrying on conversations about events like the Holocaust grows
even more important as the events themselves become further away in time. Once
the film is finished, we plan to present it in a grand screening in mid to late
May, and take our message to dance festivals and the community at large. 
  ASH was created and directed by University of New Mexico dance student
Kevin Clark, and premiered to high acclaim by a corps of UNM student dancers in
October, 2013. ASH was subsequently selected to represent UNM in a juried
showcase at the American College Dance Festival in March, 2014. Pre-production
for the ASH Project has already begun, and filming will take place in early
April, 2014. The ASH Project team consists of ten amazing dancers, an
exceptionally talented cinematography crew, a dedicated production manager, and
all of you! 
 
 
WHY FILM ASH? 
 





Dance connects us in a primal sense, filling the spaces
between us; it lives in our bones, it runs in our blood, it emotes the words we
cannot say. These reasons alone are enough to drive us to share our work with
an audience larger than live performance can reach. Even more, we want to use
the medium of film to raise ASH to a level beyond what is artistically possible
in stage performance.
 
Film also lets us bring the viewer’s focus to intimate
details - the subtle movements of fingers, facial expressions of vulnerability
and hope, the dirt under the fingernails, and the stained skin that are simply
lost on stage.


Building on the evocative
foundation of the choreography itself, we intend to use every device film can
offer to make ASH a truly captivating and visceral experience for the viewer.
To add further depth, we are developing new choreography - exclusive to the
film - that will explore the effects of religion, ritual and nature on the
themes of the piece.     


Finally, many of these amazing young artists working on
ASH hope to make careers in dance or film. In supporting the production of this
film, you can help these aspiring professionals to create a concrete
illustration of their skill and dedication, which will surely support them in
finding future opportunities to give their artistry and hard work to the arts
and to their communities.



 
About the creator of ASH
 
My name is Kevin Clark. I am in my final year of the
dance program at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, NM, and I am the
creator and artistic director of the ASH Project. Since my first introduction
to dance in high school, I have been dancing, performing, and choreographing
for 9 years. The joy and connection to other people I have found through dance
has been nothing short of life changing, and it has become my passion and life
path to use this expansive art field to contribute to the world however I can.
In 2013, I became consumed and compelled by the stories
and experiences of those impacted by the Holocaust, and I began constructing
the concept for the concert dance piece that would become ASH. Countless books,
videos, historical research, cultural connections, religious investigation, and
movement invention have gone into the development of this piece, and over this
past year ASH was brought to life with the help of the remarkable student
dancers and the world-class dance faculty at UNM.
Earlier this year, my faculty mentor for this project
encouraged me to turn ASH into a site-specific film. Originally, our plan was
simply to film the piece as it already existed; however, as planning
progressed, and more amazing artists joined us, it became clear that the medium
of film would allow us to fill in the necessary background - the cultural and
political climate, the religious, personal and social implications - that I
felt were missing from the original piece.
So here I am, because I believe we've found something special with the
ASH Project - something that deserves to be shared - and we need your help to
do that.


What We Need & What You Get
        
  We are asking for pledges to help fund the many ways we can make ASH
amazing. Creating a high quality, visually stimulating, and artistically rich
film has many important aspects, and each enhance or facilitate the process in
their own unique way. 
We decided to get personal with our perks and compiled a specialized set unique to this project, like the 30 Second
Solo or A Day On Set! Just to give
you an idea of where your generosity goes, below is a list of our highest
priority requirements to get us where we need to go:
•               
Video and Lighting (operation,
equipment, and rental)                
     
  - $4150
        
   Light and video is what makes a film a FILM! This area covers the
costs of renting lights, lighting equipment, lighting operators, rigging,
video, cinematographers, video equipment, editing, sequencing, and
operating. 
•               
Wardrobe, Costume, and
Makeup (design, construction, materials) -  $1100
      
 Costumes and makeup are essential to creating the right mood and feel of
an artistic piece. This area covers the designing of costumes and makeup
for the new sections of the piece, cost of materials, construction of those
costumes, specialized DirtWorks makeup essential to ASH, and
the makeup crew.
•               
Music Rights (licensing, publishing,
synch rights)                  
         -  $1000
        
   The music of ASH is
nothing short of breathtaking; from Arvo Pärt to Hauschka to Frederic
Chopin, the soundtrack for this film commands as much attention and emotion as
the video does. Acquiring the rights and permission to use these pieces comes
part and parcel with any film work, and these masterpieces are no
exception. 
•               
General Needs      
                     
                     
                     
          -  $1500
        
   This covers everything from dancers fees, first aid equipment,
craft services, set equipment, generators, heaters, printing, and any
unexpected costs that may arise.
In the event we raise more funds than
our goal, our plan and promise to you all is that we reinvest that money back
into the project not only to increase the quality of our final product, but to
also pay our dancers and crew a little bit more. We truly have world-class
dancers and a phenomenal crew. We want to be able to support them in any way
possible for being such a big part in the realization of this vision. 
The
Impact
Every pledge
you give, every time you like or share this project on social media, and every
person you encourage to help us puts another minute of film together, puts a
dancer in riveting clothing, shines a spotlight onto an intimate moment to be
shared with the whole world; it secures a light, feeds a camera operator, puts
sound into the ears of the viewer, and brings us that much closer to creating
the moving, riveting film I know this project can be. We are ever so humbly
grateful for all levels of your support. 
Other
Ways You Can Help

<h3>Where Does the Money Go?</h3>

The money goes to <a href=""https://drupal.org/user/288060"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Darren Douglas Lee</a>, the expert Drupal programmer (that's him on the right. He's also an artist... but like, a ninja artist!)</p>
<p>We'll re-build Playpoi.com with a responsive theme in the latest version of <a href=""https://drupal.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Drupal</a>, a powerful content-management program.</p>
<p>The remaining budget will go towards the poi-community map of the world, the looping-video-thumbnails, and making it easier for other poi artists to contribute to Playpoi.com.</p>
<p>To give you just an idea of what Darren will be doing, here's an initial breakdown:</p>
<ol>
<li>Responsive theme using the existing site artwork. (30 hours)</li>
<li>Full audit of the site content and structure. Re-implementation of existing functionality identified as useful. (50 hours)</li>
<li>Transfer of the existing site content identified as useful to a fresh Drupal 7 site. (40 hours)</li>
<li>Drupal 7 site infrastructure setup - user roles and permissions. Database and site files in scheduled backups. Editorial workflow. (20 hours)</li>
<li>Setup Pantheon development. (10 hours)</li>
<li>Onwards into community resources...</li>
</ol><h3>Other Goals</h3>
<p>Another goal is to have 10,000 people on the <a href=""http://www.playpoi.com/community/poiticipate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Playpoi newsletter</a>. If I can announce fun poi projects, they can happen! And no, Facebook doesn't work so well any more. The newsletter is better!</p>
<p>Yet another goal is to boost traffic to Playpoi.com to an average of 1000 unique visitors per day. For a few years I was dealing with a shoulder injury and website issues, etc. During this time I wasn't producing much content and website traffic went down (along with registration for Playpoi events, eek). Now that I'm producing content again I want to get traffic back up. You can help promote Playpoi simply by visiting the <a href=""http://www.playpoi.com/community/poiticipate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Poiticipation Page</a>. It's a page of mostly easy and free ways to help Playpoi be awesome. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Playpoi.com will be much more awesome!</p>
<p>I will commit to making two new videos every week for all of 2014!</p>
<p>I will go boldly into my 40's knowing that I can make a career with my love of poi! :)</p>
<p>I will spend less time wrestling with website problems and more time producing creative content, community resources, fun community projects, and getting out in the real world to have fun with other people... in short: I'll be putting much more of my energy into the People-Being-Happy-Plan!</p>

</div></div>","Our Story

What happens when your world is turned inside out? When you don't feel like yourself anymore? When your own family doesn't recognize you? When reality shifts like quicksand under your feet? Suspended Pieces is a compelling story about a young woman's journey into an abyss she never could have imagined.
 
The Impact
City of Peace is a docu-theatre company dedicated to quality issue-based theatre. Suspended Pieces is the company’s first production. Through the medium of theatre, we hope to, shed some light on a sensitive subject that many have to deal with, yet few are willing to talk about. Your contribution will allow us to put forth an honest and dynamic story about mental health. All profits from the play will go to L’Abri en Ville (www.labrienville.org), a non-profit organization in Montréal that provides housing and a stable community for people with mental health issues. Also, your contributions will help our fledgling production company get off to a strong start.
 
What We Need and What You Get
We are hiring an award-winning graphic designer to create our posters and a strong image that will encourage more people to see the show. We will be setting up a Web page with bi-weekly updates to keep those not on IndieGoGo up to date on all the exciting developments. The rest of the funds will offset the Fringe costs, costumes, props and any other expenses we incur in bringing this story to you. If we do not meet our full target, City of Peace, along with local businesses who purchase an ad in our program, will cover the difference.

<h3><strong>ABOUT THE PROJECT </strong></h3>
<p><em>Requiem For Black Marie</em> is a full-length play by Sara Farrington with an ensemble of twelve, including a live band and original score (composed and performed by the St. Fortune Theater Collective) all under the direction of Shannon Sindelar. <em>Requiem</em> is premiering at The Incubator Arts Project, June 14th-23rd.</p>
<p><em>Requiem For Black Marie</em> is a wild and darkly funny imagining of the sexual and creative ins and outs of the Brecht Machine during the Weimar Republic (1919-1933) period in Berlin. The play is Farrington's interpretation of playwright Bertolt Brecht’s collaboration with his many lovers, specifically, Elisabeth Hauptmann and Margarete Steffin, in the few years before the Brecht team fled Germany in 1933. The play rejects the commonly taken position that Brecht villainously stole from his female collaborators, but rather that the women were complicit in giving their work over to him, which led to miserable, lonely and, worst of all, anonymous lives for both women. Farrington's version of this story (which is only<em> sort of</em> historically accurate) is told in seventeen quick and theatrical scenes, inspired by accounts and stories from the real people involved as well as photos and paintings of the era.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>
<p>Oliva Contemporary Dance Project (OCDP) is a synergism of passion, audacity and perserverance. Initially founded in Italy under the name “Pantaeri,” OCDP has since evolved from 2004 to be known for its exquisite movement style and visionary choreography. With each dancer’s diverse background, individual dancers contribute to the company’s talent as a whole while still manifesting personal artistry. Michele Oliva and Francesca Dario create choreography that magnifies dancers in their prime and provides room for genuine personality to come alive on stage. The company’s trademark style integrates love, strength, and refinement on one stage; this ensures an long-lasting impression with each performance. Itaiian Artistic Director and Co-Founder's Oliva and Dario are at the helm of this global and ambitious company.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Introducting Our First Season!</strong></h3>
<p>     Macbeth: A Very Serious Play by William Shakespeare – January / February 2020</p>
<p>     Pillowman by Martin Mcdonagh – May 2020</p>
<p>     Celtic Yule: An Ancient Celebration of the Winter Solstice – November / December 2020</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We, the Miscreants of Denver, are seeking to produce high-quality, accessible and intimate fringe theatre! Welcome to our very first season announcement and our very first foray into crowdfunding! Our collective is young but we are not new to the theatre scene;  between all of our unique perspectives we have decades of experience working with and creating live theatre in Colorado, and we think we’ve got some fantastic stories that we want to share with everyone, and that includes folks who don’t normally go to the theatre.</p>
<p>Our 2020 season will have three shows and to hit that super ambitious goal we are going to need everyone’s help. Yeah, that’s right, even you! We have several tiers to suit your budget and if you can’t throw us a few dollars please take a moment to share this campaign on your social media of choice and give us a like on Facebook and Instagram, especially if you’re like Aerosmith and you don’t want to miss a thing.</p>
<p>So, why should you give us some of your hard earned money? Why not use that money for classy brunches, or fidget spinners or whatever you kids are buying these days? Well, with your money you are supporting art and local artists. By donating you become a patron of the freaking arts just like Lord Chamberlain back in the Shakespeare days. And if that isn’t enough for you then peep the perks!</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is to create cutting edge, high quality, intimate and accessible theatre that speaks to the hearts and minds of everyone, including those who don't usually go to the theatre. Your donations will go a long way toward making our community a reality!</p>
<p>Our theatre-style is human focused because we believe very strongly in the human element, be that an onstage performer, a director, or a designer. We are dedicated to paying performers and technicians what they're worth. Because you can do great theatre on a shoestring budget if you have the perfect crew of people. So, most of the money you donate will go to the artists that make these shows possible!</p>

<h3><strong>Our History</strong></h3>
<p>The Collective spun out of the idea of doing Shakespeare's MacBeth. I mean, what could possibly go wrong? And in the process of bringing the show to life an incredible, Power Ranger-like team assembled and we all liked hanging out so much that we decided to form a Megazord of Fringe theatre might! We are now Miscreant Theatre Collective, an ever-growing group of likeminded artists!</p>

</h3><p> </p><h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3><p>In a world gone mad, it's important to remember the true comedy greats, whose lasting impact lives within each and everyone of us post WWII babies.  John Belushi lived life on his terms, calling the shots and moving at a breakneck speed.  That's how he lived; that's how he performed; and what was ultimately lost in the tragedy of his death was the story of his life.</p><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><p>With tickets for the NY run of the show already on sale and selling, and the production of the documentary already rolling, we are nothing less than a freight train picking up speed as it heads down the tracks.  Are there risks the show won't happen?  I mean who knows.  But right now, it all seems like a go.  A green light as they say in Hollywood.  </p><p>The challenges are all about getting the word out and getting people to the theatre to see the show.  But what we have going in?  Is that the show was already a critical and audience success at The Hollywood Fringe Festival.  We not only see no problem transferring that success to this year and in New York City, we see it as an easy fit, especially given that the show and theatre are basically ground zero for John Belushi's creative and party life in New York City. </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Putting on a great tribute to one of the 20th Century's greatest comic geniuses and helping TWO great charities.  That's what this campaign is about.  Thank you for checking us out and for any questions you may have, please check out our FAQ section below.  As John would say: ""Parrr-TEE!""</i></h3><p>Your help in this campaign will make sure all the above happens in a professional and timely manner.  We've got great perks for any level investor and whether you can donate or not, I thank you for your time, your love of comedy and let's all raise a glass to the late great John Belushi.  </p><p>For more information, please go to our website and thank you for visiting and donating and/or passing along this campaign to others who may want to donate as well.  </p><p>Thank you from the bottom of our comedy hearts, </p><p><i><strong>The With a Little Help...It's John Belushi!

 The ImpactIn a world gone mad, it's important to remember the true comedy greats, whose lasting impact lives within each and everyone of us post WWII babies.  John Belushi lived life on his terms, calling the shots and moving at a breakneck speed.  That's how he lived; that's how he performed; and what was ultimately lost in the tragedy of his death was the story of his life.Risks & ChallengesWith tickets for the NY run of the show already on sale and selling, and the production of the documentary already rolling, we are nothing less than a freight train picking up speed as it heads down the tracks.  Are there risks the show won't happen?  I mean who knows.  But right now, it all seems like a go.  A green light as they say in Hollywood.  The challenges are all about getting the word out and getting people to the theatre to see the show.  But what we have going in?  Is that the show was already a critical and audience success at The Hollywood Fringe Festival.  We not only see no problem transferring that success to this year and in New York City, we see it as an easy fit, especially given that the show and theatre are basically ground zero for John Belushi's creative and party life in New York City.  Putting on a great tribute to one of the 20th Century's greatest comic geniuses and helping TWO great charities.  That's what this campaign is about.  Thank you for checking us out and for any questions you may have, please check out our FAQ section below.  As John would say: ""Parrr-TEE!""Your help in this campaign will make sure all the above happens in a professional and timely manner.  We've got great perks for any level investor and whether you can donate or not, I thank you for your time, your love of comedy and let's all raise a glass to the late great John Belushi.  For more information, please go to our website and thank you for visiting and donating and/or passing along this campaign to others who may want to donate as well.  Thank you from the bottom of our comedy hearts, The With a Little Help...It's John Belushi!

<h3>Who we are, Why we are</h3>
<p><strong>HEIDCO</strong> is an NYC-based, interdisciplinary dance company seeking to foster relationships between the arts and other sectors through collaboration, risk-taking and engaging our evolving audiences in new ways. We're questioning what's happening now, in the name of creation, in the name of safety, in the name of community and the proliferation of it. We are aiming to position ourselves as partners in the creative community, rather than agents of displacement. Our point of view directly regards community impact, seeking relevance and constituency amongst disparate audiences and neighbors.</p>
<p>HEIDCO creates embodied responses to wavering examples of democracy present in our society. Our process questions, empowers, and reimagines  organizational systems for the sake of research and development. HEIDCO houses an inclusive environment where collaborators are forced to confront and reshape the conventional methods of creation by distributing and exchanging the roles of leader, supporter, follower and rebel, establishing equality and mutual respect amongst the group. In her essay, (1970) ""The Tyranny of Structurelessness,"" Jo Freeman identifies how power can be distributed in the formation of informal structures. These principles - delegation, responsibility, distribution, rotation, allocation, diffusion of information, and equal access to resources - respond to her involvement in the Women's Liberation Group, and have manifested innately at the core of our process. The work explores movement, theater, bodily puzzles and invites a constant flow of in-studio conversation. Through verbal, nonverbal and unnamable language, the artists process and provide lenses into their realities while in dialogue, collision and agreement with shared space and time.</p>

Indeed, it’s being announced as one that is not only regional but national and international, too!Many young Italian dancers who have flown abroad after signing contracts with some of the most prestigious dance companies in the world will perform during the show. Moreover, career prizes will be awarded to two dancers considered to be amongst the most important on the current world dance scene: Federico Bonelli (The Royal Ballet) and Marianela Núñez (The Royal Ballet) who, along with many other extraordinary professional dancers, will receive their awards from Ms. Carla Fracci.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">ABOUT THE SHOW</b><b><br/></b>
</h3>
<p><b>So glad you’re here!</b> We’re creating a new musical — a creative, positive approach to an issue that divides us all too often. Our work has been called fresh, sensitive, and entertaining, and we hope you'll want to lend your thoughts and your support. </p><p>The show is called <i>A Pint of Understanding:
The Professor, the Policeman and the President</i>, and it all started with a
true story. Remember the controversial arrest of a famous African American
professor by a white police officer? The media ran away with the story, and that led to the “Beer Summit” with President Obama at the White
House. The whole thing got intense very quickly, and almost as quickly, it was
swept under the rug. </p>
<p>And then Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner; Donald Sterling and Ferguson…
and here we are, one nation, indivisible ... ? <b>Our team,</b> <b>the Pint Collaborative, felt we had to do something</b>, and for us,
that meant writing a musical. (<i>What</i>? More on that and the team in a minute.) Everything
we’ve learned from working together during the last 18 months has made clear
that most of us Americans — most of us humans — want the same things. We
want harmony. Respect. Change for the better. (To love and be loved. The list goes on.)</p>
<p>We believe <i>A Pint of
Understanding</i> is an important work, a rejection of this painful divide, a
revolt against complacency, a creative and positive contribution to the
progress our country can make — if we all insist on it. </p>
<p><b>And we think
it’s a really great show</b>. </p><p>Creatively, <i>A Pint of Understanding</i> might feel both familiar and adventurous to you. It’s an experiment in hybridity: It makes the most of the power and immediacy of live theater, but it also feels like a movie. The music has a jazz sensibility, but a number of genres come into play — blues, rhumba, gospel, R&amp;B and hip hop, to name a few. And ultimately, the show will make use of projections and multimedia to depict the influence of the media on society.<br/></p>
<p>The <i>Pint of Understanding</i> family includes an extended group of people who are passionate about
bringing this musical to life. They have generously given their time, talent,
and resources to help us get us to the point where we can produce a workshop
this February in Boston. We’re talking about the complete work — all the music
and a revised book (the play) based on feedback we’ve gotten from two previous developmental
readings and performances. We’ve been doing this independently, but now it’s
getting real, the stakes are higher, and we’re ready to take it to the next
level. But we can’t make it happen without you. </p><p><b>We need your help and we hope you’ll join with us.</b></p>
<p>The dubious arrest of the Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. was the inspiration for our story
— but <i>A Pint of</i> <i>Understanding</i> is a work of fiction. It ventures off and explores
the issues broadly, imagining how things might have gone if the
president had appointed the professor and the police officer to work together. We
bring all points of view into focus and introduce characters we hope you’ll
come to love. Plus, they can sing!</p>
<p>Our story offers a few twists that we think you’ll enjoy, some points
to reflect on, and — believe it or not — a lot of laughs. As Chekov said, ""Tragedy is about the difficult. Comedy is about the unbearable.” In
other words, comic relief gives us some room to breathe and the opportunity to
laugh at ourselves and then … get back to it.</p>
<p>Our creative team, “The Pint Collaborative,” consists of not one but two
composers, Joel LaRue Smith and Joseph Smith, lyricist/book writer Lee Phenner, director
Benny Sato Ambush, and music director Scott Nicholas. In a sense, our diverse
backgrounds and experiences actually bring to life the central messages of <i>A Pint of Understanding</i>. We did that on
purpose. You can learn more about us below.</p>
<p><b>A forum for discussion</b>: When we say we’re inviting you in, we
really mean it. The February 2015 workshop will feature a post-performance
discussion where the audience, cast and an expert in cultural studies will
discuss their views in an open and constructive way. And of course we’re
online, building our community on Facebook and Twitter. Like us,
follow us, join us, and we’ll have some great exchanges. (See the links on this page.)</p>
<h4><b>WHAT YOU’RE
HELPING TO CREATE</b></h4>
<p>The February workshop of <i>A Pint of Understanding </i>will feature top talent and a skilled crew, and
we’ll get the word out through strategic promotion and audience and civic engagement. Along
with the goal of creating exciting theater that people want to see, we hope to encourage
discussion and foster empathy through online and live forums. </p><p><b>We have big dreams</b>. The February workshop is the first major milestone toward professional staging and
ideally will be presented at a level that will attract a development
partner/producer.</p>
<p>The cast consists of
nine singer/actors: four in lead roles and five chorus members who play a
number of parts. We’re casting performers with a strong command of their craft
and exceptional versatility. Production costs include space rental, performer
fees, and crew fees over a two-week rehearsal and performance period in late
February.</p>
<p>The work has to be
documented with video, audio recordings, and still photography to continue promoting the work so that development can move forward.</p>
<p>There’s the less
glamorous side of the project involving essentials like marketing and
promotion, as well as legal and accounting fees.</p>

measure. Truly, any amount you can give will help. No contribution is too
small.<br/><br/></b></p><h4><b><span>YOUR IMPACT</span></b></h4>
<p><b>It’s personal</b>: If you love music. If you love musicals. If you love theater. If you
care about social justice. If you share our values — u<i>nity </i>and<i> respect</i>, e<i>mpathy</i>, b<i>eauty</i>, t<i>ruth </i>and<i> relevance</i>, and hey, a dash of<i> humor</i> —
you’ll be adding your voice to this chorus.</p>
<p><b>It’s societal</b>: Our country’s
been grappling with these issues for too long, and we need to find a healthy
way to connect, to talk and explore and really see and hear each other. We hope to add something meaningful to that conversation.</p>
<p><b>Our track record</b>: As a team,
we’ve produced two successful developmental readings, each with an engaging,
stimulating discussion afterwards. We are grateful to have received funding and
in-kind support from the Puffin Foundation, Eastern Bank Foundation, the Bob
Jolly Charitable Trust, Emerson College, Tufts University, Berklee College of
Music, and Northeastern University, as well as some generous individuals. So we
know we can take the project to the next stage — the full workshop in February.</p>
<p>in addition, the credentials and accomplishments of the individual artists
on the creative team suggest that this project can be created and
produced to the highest standards. </p>
<h4><b>PERKS</b></h4><p>
Our perks run the gamut. Some are fun, useful items that symbolize your
commitment to music, theater and the arts as a path to positive change — like our official <i>A Pint of Understanding</i> pint glasses, our official tote bag, and the <i>Pint of</i> <i>Understanding</i> unity scarf;</p>
<p>Others are mementoes that relate to our February 2015 workshop
performance — your very own photo of the cast or perhaps a signed script.</p>
<p>And some are up-close-and-personal: dinner with a member or two of the
creative team and schmoozing at an after-party with the <i>Pint</i> team and cast. </p><p></p><p><b>As one of our songs goes, “We can lead a sea change.”</b></p><p><b>But only together.</b></p><p>We hope you’ll get in on the ground floor with <i>A Pint of Understanding</i>, our new musical in development. It’s a great story with incredible music, and it delivers an important message. It’s a project, it’s a community, and it could be a movement to overcome discrimination and live up to the principles on which the United States was founded.

So glad you’re here! We’re creating a new musical — a creative, positive approach to an issue that divides us all too often. Our work has been called fresh, sensitive, and entertaining, and we hope you'll want to lend your thoughts and your support. The show is called A Pint of Understanding:
The Professor, the Policeman and the President, and it all started with a
true story. Remember the controversial arrest of a famous African American
professor by a white police officer? The media ran away with the story, and that led to the “Beer Summit” with President Obama at the White
House. The whole thing got intense very quickly, and almost as quickly, it was
swept under the rug. 
And then Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner; Donald Sterling and Ferguson…
and here we are, one nation, indivisible ... ? Our team, the Pint Collaborative, felt we had to do something, and for us,
that meant writing a musical. (What? More on that and the team in a minute.) Everything
we’ve learned from working together during the last 18 months has made clear
that most of us Americans — most of us humans — want the same things. We
want harmony. Respect. Change for the better. (To love and be loved. The list goes on.)
We believe A Pint of
Understanding is an important work, a rejection of this painful divide, a
revolt against complacency, a creative and positive contribution to the
progress our country can make — if we all insist on it. 
And we think
it’s a really great show. Creatively, A Pint of Understanding might feel both familiar and adventurous to you. It’s an experiment in hybridity: It makes the most of the power and immediacy of live theater, but it also feels like a movie. The music has a jazz sensibility, but a number of genres come into play — blues, rhumba, gospel, R&B and hip hop, to name a few. And ultimately, the show will make use of projections and multimedia to depict the influence of the media on society.
The Pint of Understanding family includes an extended group of people who are passionate about
bringing this musical to life. They have generously given their time, talent,
and resources to help us get us to the point where we can produce a workshop
this February in Boston. We’re talking about the complete work — all the music
and a revised book (the play) based on feedback we’ve gotten from two previous developmental
readings and performances. We’ve been doing this independently, but now it’s
getting real, the stakes are higher, and we’re ready to take it to the next
level. But we can’t make it happen without you. We need your help and we hope you’ll join with us.
The dubious arrest of the Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. was the inspiration for our story
— but A Pint of Understanding is a work of fiction. It ventures off and explores
the issues broadly, imagining how things might have gone if the
president had appointed the professor and the police officer to work together. We
bring all points of view into focus and introduce characters we hope you’ll
come to love. Plus, they can sing!
Our story offers a few twists that we think you’ll enjoy, some points
to reflect on, and — believe it or not — a lot of laughs. As Chekov said, ""Tragedy is about the difficult. Comedy is about the unbearable.” In
other words, comic relief gives us some room to breathe and the opportunity to
laugh at ourselves and then … get back to it.
Our creative team, “The Pint Collaborative,” consists of not one but two
composers, Joel LaRue Smith and Joseph Smith, lyricist/book writer Lee Phenner, director
Benny Sato Ambush, and music director Scott Nicholas. In a sense, our diverse
backgrounds and experiences actually bring to life the central messages of A Pint of Understanding. We did that on
purpose. You can learn more about us below.
A forum for discussion: When we say we’re inviting you in, we
really mean it. The February 2015 workshop will feature a post-performance
discussion where the audience, cast and an expert in cultural studies will
discuss their views in an open and constructive way. And of course we’re
online, building our community on Facebook and Twitter. Like us,
follow us, join us, and we’ll have some great exchanges. (See the links on this page.)
WHAT YOU’RE
HELPING TO CREATE
The February workshop of A Pint of Understanding will feature top talent and a skilled crew, and
we’ll get the word out through strategic promotion and audience and civic engagement. Along
with the goal of creating exciting theater that people want to see, we hope to encourage
discussion and foster empathy through online and live forums. We have big dreams. The February workshop is the first major milestone toward professional staging and
ideally will be presented at a level that will attract a development
partner/producer.
The cast consists of
nine singer/actors: four in lead roles and five chorus members who play a
number of parts. We’re casting performers with a strong command of their craft
and exceptional versatility. Production costs include space rental, performer
fees, and crew fees over a two-week rehearsal and performance period in late
February.
The work has to be
documented with video, audio recordings, and still photography to continue promoting the work so that development can move forward.
There’s the less
glamorous side of the project involving essentials like marketing and
promotion, as well as legal and accounting fees.
We’re building this work page by page, measure by
measure. Truly, any amount you can give will help. No contribution is too
small.YOUR IMPACT
It’s personal: If you love music. If you love musicals. If you love theater. If you
care about social justice. If you share our values — unity and respect, empathy, beauty, truth and relevance, and hey, a dash of humor —
you’ll be adding your voice to this chorus.
It’s societal: Our country’s
been grappling with these issues for too long, and we need to find a healthy
way to connect, to talk and explore and really see and hear each other. We hope to add something meaningful to that conversation.
Our track record: As a team,
we’ve produced two successful developmental readings, each with an engaging,
stimulating discussion afterwards. We are grateful to have received funding and
in-kind support from the Puffin Foundation, Eastern Bank Foundation, the Bob
Jolly Charitable Trust, Emerson College, Tufts University, Berklee College of
Music, and Northeastern University, as well as some generous individuals. So we
know we can take the project to the next stage — the full workshop in February.
in addition, the credentials and accomplishments of the individual artists
on the creative team suggest that this project can be created and
produced to the highest standards. 
PERKS
Our perks run the gamut. Some are fun, useful items that symbolize your
commitment to music, theater and the arts as a path to positive change — like our official A Pint of Understanding pint glasses, our official tote bag, and the Pint of Understanding unity scarf;
Others are mementoes that relate to our February 2015 workshop
performance — your very own photo of the cast or perhaps a signed script.
And some are up-close-and-personal: dinner with a member or two of the
creative team and schmoozing at an after-party with the Pint team and cast. As one of our songs goes, “We can lead a sea change.”But only together.We hope you’ll get in on the ground floor with A Pint of Understanding, our new musical in development. It’s a great story with incredible music, and it delivers an important message. It’s a project, it’s a community, and it could be a movement to overcome discrimination and live up to the principles on which the United States was founded. Let’s have A Pint of Understanding. Thanks!(Incidentally, you can choose to give without receiving a perk. Click the red ""Contribute Now"" button near the top of the page and enter any amount. (You can also contribute more than a designated perk amount.

<p>Hi everyone! This is Matt Sternberg, producer of Jeff Goode's The Eight: Reindeer Monologues. I've wanted to put this show up for a long time and I'm finally able to make this dream come to life. So, I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>What your contribution will mean:</strong></p>
<p>Your donations will mean that we can afford the following costs:</p>
<p>Theater rental, rehearsal space, set dressings, marketing, costumes, and a whole lot of thank yous from our company of artists that want to bring you something stimulating and awesome.</p>
<p>We have these amazing perks (some handmade and some not) from our team of designers and artists. These perks are something personal that you can hang on to and as the PSA video says, help these reindeer shine bright.  </p>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
<p>This show was written in 1993 and its themes are more relevant now than ever!  As the description above says: Santa's eight reindeer speak out about his ""un-Christmas"" like behavior and hold nothing back. Funny and touching, this show is a site to behold. This Jew is for You Production Company is doing something different and visually fantastic to set us apart. </p>
<p>I started this grassroots production company with these artists and actors to give our talent a platform to thrive. This is our first production and it's our introduction to the world. We want to continue with future projects and trust that you can help us make that happen. Most production companies need to start somewhere and the time for us is right now!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></p>
<p>We understand if you can't contribute; however, please SHARE, SHARE, SHARE (via social media) the love and what we stand for and get the word out there about our little band of artists! That's one of the best gifts you can give us. Thank you!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">PWR Presents: WASSAILMANIA</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573371338/upp9gnotvxzn7lqkp5vj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Party World Rasslin' is Austin, Texas's huge, invulnerable beacon of Ultimate Party Violence and Total Party Excess. It is a unique and miraculous spectacle celebrating friendship, beer, lore, and wrestling. Last time we gathered, we watched in mute horror as a Highland Park, Dallas-based oilman played dirty and one-upped a beloved community organizer in a display that put the “rudge” in “grudge match.” But that’s not where his reign ends… Nothing ever ends… it is time to return to the font of MAXIMUM PARTY VENGEANCE!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WINTER WONDERSLAM VI</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573371427/orsvzu0xnm15ia9tho1q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It’s cold time! The cold world approaches! Imagine… A great and friendly log, set ablaze with kindness... Cocoa, pronounced with three syllables… Snow for dogs to play in… Chompis in his tattered bathrobe… it’s “WINTERMAS”! A perfect time to return to the ancient custom of visiting breweries in beer-producing regions of Austin, reciting incantations and singing to the trees to promote a good harvest for the coming year. Wow! This is… WASSAILMANIA!</p>
<p>We'll be transforming <strong>4th Tap Brewing Co-op (10615 Metric Blvd, Austin, TX) </strong>into haunted chillscape, complete with gleaming lights, cold nights, wintry frights, and gourds of all shapes and sizes. Here, at <strong>6:30pm on December 7th</strong>, PWR's epic PARTY COMBAT will be waged once more. Will our bowl be crowned with lambswool, or will we be made a damnfool? Will our Partyweight Champion, Big Daddy Bolero, be bested in the name of holiday decency, or will his reign of hot terror ruin another family get-together? This crucial spectacle will be illuminated with a full professional lighting system, shout with a clear and juicy sound system, and broadcast on 3 screens and beyond with a sweet 3-camera video setup! Wow</p>
<p>It wasn't always like this, though. Thanks to you—the MULTIVERSE—this thing has become something far beyond what we ever could have imagined. In 5 years we've gone from a handful of people messing around in a homemade ring to the glorious spectacle we know today.  We continue to do a safer-space DIY show that is all-ages and free to the public, even as costs increase. Your continued support allows our core ethos to flourish. It means so much to us. The show remains FREE TO ATTEND, even as we mount mammoth costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE STORY SO FAR</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>At GHOST MALL, the ghost of a mall, we picked our collective jaw off the beer-spill’t ground as Dallas magnate BIG DADDY BOLERO, assisted by coffee pervert RALF MACCHIATO, handcuffed ALEXANDRA CAGE to the ring and retained the PARTYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP BELT. </p>
<p>The ambitious and towering BDB remains shielded from interference by the Mother Worm, and can pursue his goal of total domination and utter development of the Multiverse. That’s sour news! But can he bulldoze and jack up the price of… holiday cheer itself? He intends to find out!</p>
<p>Only one person… one nymph… stands between Big Daddy and his big scheme: SWEETIE TUFF! They watched their beloved CRYBABY die away at the hands of a cyber-assassin Bolero hired, and now they’re thirsty for two things: Apple wassail, and revenge!</p>
<p>Gather round the yule log and gaze into the fire… this combat is going to be hot!</p>
<p>FULL CRIMBO CHEER awaits: as the usual PARTY ATHLETES explore the universe of story: Luigi Primo, Bull DeCroix, The Dumpster Babes, Sweetie Tuff, Dock Master, Pastaman, Bench Horse, The Valkyries Ralph Machiatto, Sprida , Arbitro Obscuro, Hot Dog, and MORE!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is this money used for?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>$6000 is a lot of money! What’s it going toward?</p>
<p>First, an important recitation: PWR's quarterly Austin shows are free. PWR is for everyone, even if they can't afford to pay cover at a show. We'd like to keep from having to charge admission for as long as we can.</p>
<p>PWR is also now a 80-person organization putting on one of the largest free events in Texas. Increased expectations beget increased (and wholly worthwhile) costs: we spend north of $10,000 on each of our shows.</p>
<p>We diligently budget and carefully save so that we can ask for an amount that is sustainable. We are continuously able to improve the show and make it grander; our rigorous planning -- combined with your support -- have allowed us to do this without our costs ballooning to a hellish degree! It's all on the backs of our beautiful volunteers who submit themselves to the Multiverse out of love. We've survived more than five years as we've grown into the massive wrestling party you know today—and we're not slowing down! Accept no impostors! HELL RIGHT</p>
<p>Some of the cool things your donations will help us do include:</p>
<p><strong>Art and design.</strong> We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage. 4th Tap was turned into a mall horizon at our last show! This time, we're turning the brewery into an incredible gourd frenzy! Though most of our resources are scavenged from trash bins and thrift stores, filling a venue of our size with cool decorations—and the storage to keep them preserved show after show!—costs money.</p>
<p><strong>Air Conditioning.</strong> Not a concern this show!</p>
<p><strong>Paying artists.</strong> We work hard to make sure everyone who contributes to our production gets some money in exchange—whether our art team, our powerful tech wizards, or our A/V crew.</p>
<p><strong>Safer space/security.</strong> PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Projection and lighting.</strong> PWR has some of the most advanced lighting for an independent wrestling show in the country! And we built it ourselves, with your help. We always have tweaks to make to reach towards our goal of TV-quality lighting. If you saw our lights at the last show, you know how shockingly powerful our latest generation is! Also, our projection system allows people to watch the show from 3 different places in the venue, each with different sitting and standing options! Plus, we now STREAM our shows over twitch, and your support helps us improve the quality of it.</p>
<p><strong>Training.</strong> Party Violence is its own unique sport. We have crafted a training program that makes use of experienced pro-wrestling coaching to help keep our PARTY ATHLETES smooth n' safe.  </p>
<p><strong>Profit split.</strong> after we cover all our costs, we take 20% of our profits and reinvest it in PWR. We split up whatever is left among performers and staff who worked on the show.</p>
<p>For transparency: this Indiegogo doesn’t cover all of adolescent PWR’s expenses, but it takes care of a big chunk of them. Below is our complete operational budget.</p>
<p><strong>Show Expenses: </strong>$2115.00:</p>
<p>Art Supplies: $400.00</p>
<p>Equipment Rental and Accessories (AC units, Video/Sound, Generators, etc): $250</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As PWR continues its evolution from backyard party to professional art-collective, we never want to lose the heart of partying and stupidness that makes it good. We aim to balance a relentless work ethic with a light touch and and inviting environment for our attendants, volunteers and staff. It's hard wrangling 80 people to put on a huge free show, but knowing others will join us to reap the rewards makes it worth it one million times. Rest assured we're working tirelessly to have the time of our lives on December 7th! </p>

</div><p> </p></div>","PWR Presents: WASSAILMANIA

Party World Rasslin' is Austin, Texas's huge, invulnerable beacon of Ultimate Party Violence and Total Party Excess. It is a unique and miraculous spectacle celebrating friendship, beer, lore, and wrestling. Last time we gathered, we watched in mute horror as a Highland Park, Dallas-based oilman played dirty and one-upped a beloved community organizer in a display that put the “rudge” in “grudge match.” But that’s not where his reign ends… Nothing ever ends… it is time to return to the font of MAXIMUM PARTY VENGEANCE!
 
WINTER WONDERSLAM VI
 

It’s cold time! The cold world approaches! Imagine… A great and friendly log, set ablaze with kindness... Cocoa, pronounced with three syllables… Snow for dogs to play in… Chompis in his tattered bathrobe… it’s “WINTERMAS”! A perfect time to return to the ancient custom of visiting breweries in beer-producing regions of Austin, reciting incantations and singing to the trees to promote a good harvest for the coming year. Wow! This is… WASSAILMANIA!
We'll be transforming 4th Tap Brewing Co-op (10615 Metric Blvd, Austin, TX) into haunted chillscape, complete with gleaming lights, cold nights, wintry frights, and gourds of all shapes and sizes. Here, at 6:30pm on December 7th, PWR's epic PARTY COMBAT will be waged once more. Will our bowl be crowned with lambswool, or will we be made a damnfool? Will our Partyweight Champion, Big Daddy Bolero, be bested in the name of holiday decency, or will his reign of hot terror ruin another family get-together? This crucial spectacle will be illuminated with a full professional lighting system, shout with a clear and juicy sound system, and broadcast on 3 screens and beyond with a sweet 3-camera video setup! Wow
It wasn't always like this, though. Thanks to you—the MULTIVERSE—this thing has become something far beyond what we ever could have imagined. In 5 years we've gone from a handful of people messing around in a homemade ring to the glorious spectacle we know today.  We continue to do a safer-space DIY show that is all-ages and free to the public, even as costs increase. Your continued support allows our core ethos to flourish. It means so much to us. The show remains FREE TO ATTEND, even as we mount mammoth costs.
 
THE STORY SO FAR
 
At GHOST MALL, the ghost of a mall, we picked our collective jaw off the beer-spill’t ground as Dallas magnate BIG DADDY BOLERO, assisted by coffee pervert RALF MACCHIATO, handcuffed ALEXANDRA CAGE to the ring and retained the PARTYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP BELT. 
The ambitious and towering BDB remains shielded from interference by the Mother Worm, and can pursue his goal of total domination and utter development of the Multiverse. That’s sour news! But can he bulldoze and jack up the price of… holiday cheer itself? He intends to find out!
Only one person… one nymph… stands between Big Daddy and his big scheme: SWEETIE TUFF! They watched their beloved CRYBABY die away at the hands of a cyber-assassin Bolero hired, and now they’re thirsty for two things: Apple wassail, and revenge!
Gather round the yule log and gaze into the fire… this combat is going to be hot!
FULL CRIMBO CHEER awaits: as the usual PARTY ATHLETES explore the universe of story: Luigi Primo, Bull DeCroix, The Dumpster Babes, Sweetie Tuff, Dock Master, Pastaman, Bench Horse, The Valkyries Ralph Machiatto, Sprida , Arbitro Obscuro, Hot Dog, and MORE!
 
What is this money used for?
 
$6000 is a lot of money! What’s it going toward?
First, an important recitation: PWR's quarterly Austin shows are free. PWR is for everyone, even if they can't afford to pay cover at a show. We'd like to keep from having to charge admission for as long as we can.
PWR is also now a 80-person organization putting on one of the largest free events in Texas. Increased expectations beget increased (and wholly worthwhile) costs: we spend north of $10,000 on each of our shows.
We diligently budget and carefully save so that we can ask for an amount that is sustainable. We are continuously able to improve the show and make it grander; our rigorous planning -- combined with your support -- have allowed us to do this without our costs ballooning to a hellish degree! It's all on the backs of our beautiful volunteers who submit themselves to the Multiverse out of love. We've survived more than five years as we've grown into the massive wrestling party you know today—and we're not slowing down! Accept no impostors! HELL RIGHT
Some of the cool things your donations will help us do include:
Art and design. We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage. 4th Tap was turned into a mall horizon at our last show! This time, we're turning the brewery into an incredible gourd frenzy! Though most of our resources are scavenged from trash bins and thrift stores, filling a venue of our size with cool decorations—and the storage to keep them preserved show after show!—costs money.
Air Conditioning. Not a concern this show!
Paying artists. We work hard to make sure everyone who contributes to our production gets some money in exchange—whether our art team, our powerful tech wizards, or our A/V crew.
Safer space/security. PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.
Projection and lighting. PWR has some of the most advanced lighting for an independent wrestling show in the country! And we built it ourselves, with your help. We always have tweaks to make to reach towards our goal of TV-quality lighting. If you saw our lights at the last show, you know how shockingly powerful our latest generation is! Also, our projection system allows people to watch the show from 3 different places in the venue, each with different sitting and standing options! Plus, we now STREAM our shows over twitch, and your support helps us improve the quality of it.
Training. Party Violence is its own unique sport. We have crafted a training program that makes use of experienced pro-wrestling coaching to help keep our PARTY ATHLETES smooth n' safe.  
Profit split. after we cover all our costs, we take 20% of our profits and reinvest it in PWR. We split up whatever is left among performers and staff who worked on the show.
For transparency: this Indiegogo doesn’t cover all of adolescent PWR’s expenses, but it takes care of a big chunk of them. Below is our complete operational budget.
Show Expenses: $2115.00:
Art Supplies: $400.00
Equipment Rental and Accessories (AC units, Video/Sound, Generators, etc): $250
Construction Supplies: $50
Insurance: $455.00

Ring/Facilities Maintenance: $175.00
Office Supplies: $30.00
Props/Costume: $75.00
Security Phone: $60.00
Transportation: $350.00
Service Subscriptions: $70
Operational Expenses: $4470:
Artist and Staff Pay: $4070
New Projects Capital: $400.00
Indiegogo Reward production and fulfillment: $2912
Indiegogo and credit card fees: $548.709

Extremely Hype Swag
As always, your donation comes with a cool perk! Check out this incredible design by Nat Bradford, available in 2 fabric colors as a t-shirt or a sweatshirt!How about Sweat...PANTS!And hey, PWR candles are BACK! You can get these grey-black ones with the DRAGON BLOOD scent!Or, GREEN-hued candles scented of CHRISTMAS THYME (pics forthcoming!)
Risks and Challenges
 
As PWR continues its evolution from backyard party to professional art-collective, we never want to lose the heart of partying and stupidness that makes it good. We aim to balance a relentless work ethic with a light touch and and inviting environment for our attendants, volunteers and staff. It's hard wrangling 80 people to put on a huge free show, but knowing others will join us to reap the rewards makes it worth it one million times. Rest assured we're working tirelessly to have the time of our lives on December 7th!

<p>Who is <strong>LMI</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>LET ME IN is a theatre company run by Justine Christensen and Patrick J. Horan.</p></li>
<li><p>The company began three years ago in theatre school, when Justine and Patrick discovered a mutual obsession with the artistic possibilities of adaptation. This came about after working together on a year-long ""found text"" project that forced them to look at classical work in a new way. </p></li>
<li>Since then, LMI has been interested in producing impulsive work that disrupts <strong>perceptions of gender</strong> in classical and contemporary theatre.

<h3>Who We Are &amp; What We're Doing</h3>
<p><strong>TYA Professional Training Program</strong> provides high-quality professional musical theatre training to young artists while producing award-winning and cutting-edge theatre. We also have a strong history of producing area premieres, and this season is no different.  This January, TYA Professional Training Program will produce the <strong>area premiere</strong> of new American musical, <strong><i>Hands on a Hardbody</i></strong>. Based on a documentary film of the same name, the show follows ten contestants in a competition at a local car dealership who compete to win a Nissan hardbody pickup truck. The last contestant who has his or her hands on the truck wins it. Throughout the musical, the audience learns the background of the characters in the competition.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The central set piece (and a character in the play in its own right) for <i>Hands on a Hardbody</i> is a pickup truck. That’s right—we have to get a pickup truck on our stage to tell this story. We’ve already located the perfect truck, which is perfectly outfitted to be in the show. Now we just need the funds to purchase it and get it here. We remain committed to providing a theatrical education to any student accepted into TYA, and we don’t raise tuition when production costs like pickup trucks find their way into a budget for a show we’re producing. It <i>does</i> mean that we need to get creative with getting it here, and that’s why we’re turning to you. Please consider supporting this campaign to get TYA’s hands on this hardbody truck.</p>
<p>We're aiming to raise at least <strong>$2,500</strong> to cover the cost to <strong>purchase, transport, and install</strong> the truck in our space.  We have some great perks to reward those of you who would like to support this project. Bring home a piece of #TYAHandsOn memorabilia like a <strong>limited edition t-shirt</strong> or <strong>trucker hat</strong> OR make a lasting memory with a <strong>pre-show photo opportunity</strong> in the passenger seat of the truck and <strong>front row seats</strong> to this exciting area premiere.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Funding this project will ensure that we are able to continue to provide a well-rounded theatrical education to advanced theatre students. In addition to working with professional directors and designers to produce high-quality, professional, cutting edge theatre, our students also learn character development and arts management skills through work on dramaturgy projects and marketing teams. By bringing this truck to our stage through this crowdfunding campaign, we can make sure that all tuition these students pay continues to go directly to the education they receive rather than to  the expenses of the production. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have tackled many theatrical challenges over the course of several seasons of cutting edge theatre with TYA professional training program. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building a chic NYC restaurant on stage for <i>First Date</i><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480448711/xuahmtpki3gezg7ptksm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </li>

<li>Magic and illusions live on stage with <i>Ghost the Musical</i>
</li>
<li>Building a revolve for <i>Les Miserables</i>... and so many more!</li>
</ul>
<p>There are inherent risks in creating theatre, but we've navigated through many and are confident in our abilities to execute another challenging piece of live theatre. We are fortunate to have found a truck that has already been outfitted for a production of this title. Our largest obstacle right now is the cost to bring it here. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Val Dunn and I'm gathering my community to drink beer, express rage, and hex Mike Pence. The play's called <i>Now More Than Ever</i>; it's a dark comedy about our commitment to rage and ineffectual activism. Come join us in a secret West Philly attic hideout where we've kidnapped the vice president and America is magically fixed! Maura Krause is directing this jawn featuring the work of Zandra Espinoza, Alison Ormsby, Minou Pourshariati, Sara Outing, Eliana Fabiyi, &amp; more. I'm not saying this play will actually solve anything. I'm just saying you look like you need to take a 70-minute time out to drink a beer and cast aside empathy. <i>Now More Than Ever</i> will be my premiere in the Philadelphia Fringe Festival; I'm excited to come out with your support. Cheers! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">~:~:~:~</p>
<p>Val Dunn is a Philadelphia-based playwright &amp; deviser who creates plays, performance art, and rituals. Val enjoys fighting fascism with radical queer joy (primarily in the form of foolish dancing to the West Philadelphia Orchestra). She is an alumna of the Foundry and a current member of Writers on the Rocks with whom she has developed <i>A Shock of Wheat</i>, <i>I Know the Wind for the Things It Touches</i>, and <i>Down in the Holler</i> (Play Penn 2018; semifinalist, Bay Area Playwrights Festival 2018). Val’s work has been supported by the Orchard Project, Centrum, Juniper Productions, The Bearded Ladies Cabaret, Azuka’s Spotlight Series, SANDBOX, and Philly Plays @ the Drake. The day after this show closes she will flee America to hike 177 mile hike along Offa's Dyke on the English/Welsh border. If this play doesn't fix everything, Val may never return... Support her art while you still can!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help to raise $1,300 to cover the cost of a bare bones production. Your contribution will go directly to invaluable expenses such as props, air conditioning for the attic, and performer fees. If we <i>exceed</i> our goal, we get to pay our artists sums closer to what they actually deserve! (Wow! Artists should get paid adequately for their work, what a concept?!)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Can theatre really change things? Fuck if I know. But I guess it's worth risking a $5 donation on the chance that our play <i>could</i> contribute to getting rid of the Trump/Pence regime. You'd buy a beer for $5. Heck, some of you might buy <i>half</i> a beer for $7 at Local 44. Why not throw $5 toward the kind of scrappy-as-hell art ritual that's the reason the NEA no longer has funding?! </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Maura Krause is an expert producer/artistic director/director/dramaturg/kick-boxing-witch-goddess &amp; I'm really enthusiastic! And WOAH have you seen our cast &amp; creative team?! Together, </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I think we can make this jawn happen! All we need is your dirty money*!</span></p>
<p><i>*and universal healthcare, clean water for Flint, basic rights for Trans folx, open borders, $15 minimum wage, regulations of carbon emissions... </i></p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi! I'm Val Dunn and I'm gathering my community to drink beer, express rage, and hex Mike Pence. The play's called Now More Than Ever; it's a dark comedy about our commitment to rage and ineffectual activism. Come join us in a secret West Philly attic hideout where we've kidnapped the vice president and America is magically fixed! Maura Krause is directing this jawn featuring the work of Zandra Espinoza, Alison Ormsby, Minou Pourshariati, Sara Outing, Eliana Fabiyi, & more. I'm not saying this play will actually solve anything. I'm just saying you look like you need to take a 70-minute time out to drink a beer and cast aside empathy. Now More Than Ever will be my premiere in the Philadelphia Fringe Festival; I'm excited to come out with your support. Cheers! 
~:~:~:~
Val Dunn is a Philadelphia-based playwright & deviser who creates plays, performance art, and rituals. Val enjoys fighting fascism with radical queer joy (primarily in the form of foolish dancing to the West Philadelphia Orchestra). She is an alumna of the Foundry and a current member of Writers on the Rocks with whom she has developed A Shock of Wheat, I Know the Wind for the Things It Touches, and Down in the Holler (Play Penn 2018; semifinalist, Bay Area Playwrights Festival 2018). Val’s work has been supported by the Orchard Project, Centrum, Juniper Productions, The Bearded Ladies Cabaret, Azuka’s Spotlight Series, SANDBOX, and Philly Plays @ the Drake. The day after this show closes she will flee America to hike 177 mile hike along Offa's Dyke on the English/Welsh border. If this play doesn't fix everything, Val may never return... Support her art while you still can!

What We Need & What You Get
We need your help to raise $1,300 to cover the cost of a bare bones production. Your contribution will go directly to invaluable expenses such as props, air conditioning for the attic, and performer fees. If we exceed our goal, we get to pay our artists sums closer to what they actually deserve! (Wow! Artists should get paid adequately for their work, what a concept?!)

The Impact
Can theatre really change things? Fuck if I know. But I guess it's worth risking a $5 donation on the chance that our play could contribute to getting rid of the Trump/Pence regime. You'd buy a beer for $5. Heck, some of you might buy half a beer for $7 at Local 44. Why not throw $5 toward the kind of scrappy-as-hell art ritual that's the reason the NEA no longer has funding?! 
Maura Krause is an expert producer/artistic director/director/dramaturg/kick-boxing-witch-goddess & I'm really enthusiastic! And WOAH have you seen our cast & creative team?! Together, I think we can make this jawn happen! All we need is your dirty money*!
*and universal healthcare, clean water for Flint, basic rights for Trans folx, open borders, $15 minimum wage, regulations of carbon emissions... 

Risks & Challenges
I am fronting all of the money to put on this bare bones production. If we don't meet our fundraising goal, I will become a full-time employee of Federal Donuts, and the Philadelphia Theatre Community will never see the like of me again. Save yourselves from that fate! 
Creating any piece about contemporary issues runs the risk of becoming prematurely irrelevant. On the off chance that our earnest Facebook posts and leftist in-fighting fix all of the issues discussed in this play (TW: Trump, Pence, fascism, capitalism, white supremacy, white feminism, nationalism, homophobia, transphobia, etc.) before September 14th, 2018... we will use this money to throw a giant bacchanalian party. 
Also, apparently it’s not illegal to put children in cages but it is illegal to threaten public officials. But what is art if not taking risks? I’m not suggesting that this show condones violence… but neither will it inspire you to fly an American flag from your Baltimore Ave. anarchist co-op.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Recognize Theatre is comprised of one director, Kristin Heckler; three actors, Jacob-Sebastian Phillips, Sarah Raimondi, Pauline Sherrow; and one producer, Aurea Tomeski. We are a small team with a powerful story. Recognize Theatre is dedicated to rebuilding society's image of the sexual woman into a positive one, and Exposed is no exception. With this production, we hope to get reviews, additional producer and hopefully, a next production or a tour!</p>
<p>Our play presents the story of the Duke Pornstar, renamed Ariel Cox (:-)). We seek to humanize this celebrity and force each person to ask themselves what they thought when they heard about the scandal. The play juxtaposes choreographed staged porn scenes with original scripted scenes created by the team. The audience follows our heroine from hidden high school masturbation through the thrill of her secret porn career through the violent tweets and derisive talk show hosts to her standing up for herself and the consequences of her choices.</p>
<p>The writing process has been unique. The first draft contained only found text from articles about the incident, actual tweets and verbatim interviews. The ""Twitter Storm"" and ""Talk Show"" have barely changed since that first draft but we realized we wanted to breathe real life into this girl and the people surrounding her. We began improvising some ""day in the life"" style scenes and the new structure built from there. The four of us work together to determine which snippets of her life we need or want to see in order to stitch the major plot points together. Jacob, Sarah and Pauline then improvise the scene, Kristin records it and then writes a draft scene based on that improv. The next rehearsal, the draft scene is read at the table, discarded, more specific goals are determined for the scene and the actors improv the scene again. We continue in this pattern until the scene feels completed. The script at that point is frozen with the understanding that small words or sections of sentences will always change, even in performance. Although it's always true for theatre, each performance of Exposed is truly different.</p>
<p>This play is unique and the story is sensational, literally, but NYC is inundated with live theatre and we need to get the word out there! That's where you come in.</p>
<p>We've secured the funds for our venue and have cleverly built a low budget production but we want to hire a PR Agent to let everyone know about the show. We've found someone who can get our show the coverage we need for $2000.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $2000 for a NYC PR Agent</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Recognize Theatre has been producing theatre in New York for three years, including at the New York International Fringe Festival. We have upheld our mission to present theatre which challenges society's preconceived ideas about what is feminine and what is masculine with plays like <i>How I Learned to Drive</i> and <i>Paraphilia: Everyone Has A Sexual Disorder.</i> </p>
<p>In this play we tackle the ever burgeoning issue of ""slut-shaming"" and the double standard men and women experience with regard to sexuality. Women are encouraged to be a ""lady in the streets but a freak in the bed"" and men are often encouraged to ""sow their wild oats"" and ""play the field."" But some women want to wear their sexuality on their sleeve and some men want monogamy, or even other men. What about them?</p>
<p>If it was discovered that a male freshman was doing porn to pay for his tuition, would people have encouraged him to kill himself? </p>
<p>The Duke pornstar chose to perform in rough, BDSM porn and was told that she couldn't be empowered while several dudes ejaculated on her face. Can you tell someone that they aren't empowered when they say they are? Can a woman be empowered by being subjugated?</p>
<p>On The View, the Duke pornstar said she watched porn since she was 12 and the hosts were scandalized, shocked. Would they have reacted that way if she were a boy? Do they know girls experience puberty, and therefore sexuality, before boys?</p>
<p>How can a woman be a freak in the bed if she also isn't expected to learn or think about sex?</p>
<p>Why did everyone care so much that this girl did porn? Is it because she's smart? Or because she defended her choice? Or because she considered this option to begin with?</p>
<p>These questions need to be asked and our play asks them. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Exposing New Yorkers to Exposed is our biggest challenge! We've got the show ready to go, we need the people!</p>
<p>All of our other combined costs total; $8,000, three weeks at our venue being the largest expense at $6,900. </p>
<p>The investment of our time, two years of rehearsals and productions, and money would all be wasted if we aren't able to propel the show to the next level. We want to get the attention of producers so we can work toward moving the show to either a national tour or an Off-Broadway house. To do that, we need reviews. To get reviews, we need a PR agent.</p>
<p>More important than press is an audience. We've got 3 weeks, 11 performances, and 550 seats to fill and a PR agent helping to spread the word will get people to our show!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Monique. I have been writing this show my entire life without knowing it. I am a singer, songwriter, playwright and truth seeker. I grew up afraid of everything and everyone, which meant I did a lot of observing from afar. But with that distance came a longing to be connected to people. I've spent my life exploring what it means to be honest, authentic and your full self. I've traveled the world entertaining international audiences including foreign dignitaries, high class prostitutes, oil tycoons and I'm sure at least one spy.  I coach people to use their 'voice' to express their greater 'Voice' in the world. </li>
<li>This campaign is important to me because I believe the story I'm telling is a universal one. Yes, it's main character is a mixed race woman, but we have all struggled to find and claim our own identity. This show allows audiences to witness a fellow human being's journey and at the same time, reflect on their own journey. It will make you laugh, cry and open your heart in a way that will have you wanting to connect with people you've never noticed before. Or one better, it'll have you feeling more empowered to connect with people you've wanted to but were too afraid or felt too awkward to do. </li>
<li>By contributing to this campaign, you will help make a dream come true. This show is a trailblazer and leads the way towards more understanding of yourself and those around you. By contributing to my campaign you will support great theater. I have the intention of having this show land on Broadway- with your contribution, you can get in on the ground floor and say that you knew it would make it!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>My intention is to raise $12,000.  This money will cover production costs (set design, lighting and audio design, the theater tech), theater rental and PR to get the word out. The theater rental alone cost over $6000! </li>
<li>The perks offered are few, but great. You can support at any level and receive my original music, performance tickets for the spring run, one on one holistic voice sessions with me or your own masterfully curated performance for your friends or your organization. This show is an awesome conversation starter and can be beautifully used in a corporate setting as well. The perks will continue to be revealed as the campaign goes on...</li>
<li>If we don't reach the entire goal, please rest assure that every cent that we DO raise will go right into the production. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project is valuable to the world because our country is in a state where we can no longer be satisfied from seeing each other as different, less than or asshole-y (yes that is a word). This show lays the foundation for those who get to see it (and those who simply get to hear about it) to begin the beautiful process of self-reflection and connection in a time when we're desperate for it. </li>
<li>I've written and recorded two albums (which you can take home as a perk!) and have also just completed a third one which will be released later next year. I am a mother of two young  boys whom I adore. I am responsible person, especially with other people's hard earned energy. I am so enthused and inspired by this project because I know its value when it's experienced. I am absolutely committed to making this show happen in March. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I honestly don't see any risks or challenges to making this show a success in the spring. I feel like a lot of the heavy lifting has been done all this year in writing the show. It took every ounce of courage to write the stories that are shared in this show. I always felt that my life, my experiences weren't mine to share because other people were involved in them. It took being diagnosed with a health condition to help me realize that I am not responsible for anyone's experience but my own. And me keeping all my stories locked inside was impacting my health, my life force. </p>
<p>No more. </p>
<p>All of 2017 has been spent writing, crafting and workshopping this show. I truly believe the hard part is behind me and with your financial contribution, we can tell this story to so many more people. Will you help me do that?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that we are all not able to contribute financially. I get it. If you fall into that category, I know your energy is valuable and I would greatly appreciate you helping in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please get the word out and make some noise about my campaign. Sharing the link on your social media, telling your friends, coworkers, strangers about the show. (What a great excuse to speak to someone you've been wanting to connect with!) </li>
<li>If you're able to share the word with 5 people in a tangible way (sharing the link on their walls, snapping a picture of you with the person you tell about it with Hashtag #MulattoMath, I'll happily give you a shout out on social media. It will be fun!)</li>
<li>Please use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Thank you for your time and the energy it took to read this. I know our time and attention are our two most precious resources.  I don't take you for granted. </p><p>Help me raise the funds needed and let's get Mulatto Math out into the world!</p><p>Love and light.<br/>Monique</p></div>","Summary

is not a person alive who has not in some way been touched by Alzheimer's

It is difficult to put into words the array of emotions one feels when faced
with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s in one’s family. Denial. Anger. Despair. Sadness. Confusion.
Helplessness. <br/>
<p>Three years ago, we came across
a play that we felt touched upon all of these emotions in a funny, moving and ultimately
hopeful way.<span>  We wanted to produce the
play immediately, but with a cast of 7 characters, it was prohibitively
expensive for us.  </span><br/></p>
<p>So, we put it on the proverbial
“shelf”. <br/></p>
<p>But we have decided that the play
is simply too important to sit on that shelf any longer.  We have decided
to take the plunge and commit to producing this powerful piece of theatre in
the spring of 2016, and to reach out to you—all of you who have been affected
by this disease—and ask you to help us bring this beautiful story to the stage.
It is our hope that this play will offer catharsis and solace to those who have
been called upon to meet the often unfathomable demands of remaining true to a

We are looking to raise <b>$25,000</b> to help us cover the costs of artist salaries
and community outreach activities around this production.
<p>The size of this production is a
stretch for us.<span>  We are a small regional
theater and generally keep our cast to just a few actors, but we feel the
subject matter and this playwright’s vision are well worth the additional risk.</span><br/></p>
<p>So we humbly ask you to consider
how this disease touches all of our lives and to take an active role in helping
us to bring this play to the stage.<span></span><br/></p>
<p><i>With your help</i>, we can spark a
dialogue and promote healing throughout our entire community, across boundaries
of gender, age and social class.</p>
<p><i>With your help</i>, we can host
post-performance talkbacks with professionals in the field of elder care and
off-site programming at assisted living facilities, extending the impact of who
the play reaches and what voices are heard.</p>
<p><i>With your help</i>, we can create an
on-site Context Room, an interactive space for audiences to listen to
pre-performance talks, to explore the issues and emotions raised by the play,
and to share their own experiences.</p>
<p>We
want to create a movement around this play—but we need you.

entire funding goal is reached.  Whatever funds are raised will go toward
the production, and we will find a way to fund the rest.  We always do. The
show must go on! Without your help,
this will truly be a great stretch for us.<span> 
But with your help, if we are successful in raising $25,000, we will end
our fiscal year on much stronger footing and be in a much better position to
produce the next really important play that comes our way.</span></p>

<p>At the risk of sounding naive,
the most important thing you get by contributing to our campaign is the joy of
being a part of something positive - something bigger than yourself.  You get to give hope and support to
those who need to know they’re not alone. You get to honor a loved one, gone
too soon, and the people who cared for them.</p>
<p>This is a horrible disease that we
cannot yet control or overcome.  But human beings are resilient, and artists
perhaps most of all.  We cannot yet defeat this disease, but through art
and community, we can seek solace and comfort in our shared experiences, and
honor lives well-lived. This is why we do theatre.  It is not for a
paycheck or for fame or praise.  It is to transform the world one life at
a time.

<p>Plays developed by Luna Stage
have gone on to be produced in New York and around the country.  In the last
few years alone, our premieres have been produced in New York City, Chicago,
and Cleveland.  <i>The Whipping Man</i>
by Matthew Lopez, developed and premiered by Luna Stage, has been one of the
most produced plays in the country for the last three years running.

</p>
<p>We expect <i>Old Love New Love</i> to have a long life beyond our premiere
production.  We are investing in this play, and asking YOU to invest in
this play, because we believe it has the potential to speak universally to
audiences across the country. </p>
<p>We believe <i>Old Love New Love</i> can get people talking and thinking about
Alzheimer's Disease the way <i>Wit</i> made
people think about cancer and <i>The Laramie
Project</i> made people think about gay rights.  Our production—OUR
production—could be the spark that starts a flame: a flame of healing, of
increased awareness, and of action.</p>

<p>Producing theatre is a crazy
business.  Government and corporate support for the arts is dwindling, and
the massive explosion of technology competes for everyone’s attention and
dollars.  But still, we persevere. Why?  Because we believe that as
people become less and less connected to their families and their neighbors and
their communities, that live theatre becomes more vital that ever.

</p>
<p>Because
of how much we value that responsibility, we pick plays that start hard
conversations and share uncomfortable truths. We pick plays that ask our
audiences to dig deep into their empathy. We pick plays that resonate in the here and now and that
will challenge our audience to see their world and themselves a little
differently. Those kinds of plays aren’t always easy to fund. </p>
<p>And perhaps most importantly, we
produce new plays.  Plenty of theatres produce the classics of the
American Theatre and there is a place for that.  But we're looking to
identify the <u>next</u> classic, the <u>new</u> voice that will alter the
course of the American theatre, and thus our lives.</p>
<p>This is inherently risky. 
There is no name recognition with a new play. You can't count on getting reviews.
You can't control it when the weather forces you to cancel performances.  </p>
<p>But we can rely on this. For 23
years we have watched audience members of all ages and backgrounds walk into
our 99-seat theatre and 90-120 minutes later walk out transformed. This is what
theatre can do.  It can hold a mirror up to our society and ourselves, and
in that dark room, where you can see the sweat forming on the face of an actor and
feel the subtle movements of the person sitting besides you, one is reminded
that we are all human, and that we all share the same origin and ultimately the
same fate. But in that time in between, we are capable of greatness. </p>

<br/><br/><p></p></span></div>","There
is not a person alive who has not in some way been touched by Alzheimer's
Disease. And while we pray that one day soon scientists will discover a cure or
prevention, in the interim, we must find ways to seek comfort and a deeper understanding
of the emotional aftermath of this devastating illness.


At Luna Stage, we don’t look for the most popular plays or the plays that will
make the most money.  We look for the
plays that will change lives. For 23
years, Luna Stage has been developing and producing new plays that foster
a sense of community and spark honest, heartfelt discussion, even around the
most sensitive of subjects.

And so it is with great pride and anticipation that this spring, we will produce the world premiere of Old Love New Love, a beautiful and life-affirming new play by Laura Brienza about the challenges of caring for a loved
one with Alzheimer's and the lengths one often has to go to in order
to truly honor a life. 


It is difficult to put into words the array of emotions one feels when faced
with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s in one’s family. Denial. Anger. Despair. Sadness. Confusion.
Helplessness. 
Three years ago, we came across
a play that we felt touched upon all of these emotions in a funny, moving and ultimately
hopeful way.  We wanted to produce the
play immediately, but with a cast of 7 characters, it was prohibitively
expensive for us.  
So, we put it on the proverbial
“shelf”. 
But we have decided that the play
is simply too important to sit on that shelf any longer.  We have decided
to take the plunge and commit to producing this powerful piece of theatre in
the spring of 2016, and to reach out to you—all of you who have been affected
by this disease—and ask you to help us bring this beautiful story to the stage.
It is our hope that this play will offer catharsis and solace to those who have
been called upon to meet the often unfathomable demands of remaining true to a
life-long love in the face of this devastating disease.


We are looking to raise $25,000 to help us cover the costs of artist salaries
and community outreach activities around this production.
The size of this production is a
stretch for us.  We are a small regional
theater and generally keep our cast to just a few actors, but we feel the
subject matter and this playwright’s vision are well worth the additional risk.
So we humbly ask you to consider
how this disease touches all of our lives and to take an active role in helping
us to bring this play to the stage.
With your help, we can spark a
dialogue and promote healing throughout our entire community, across boundaries
of gender, age and social class.
With your help, we can host
post-performance talkbacks with professionals in the field of elder care and
off-site programming at assisted living facilities, extending the impact of who
the play reaches and what voices are heard.
With your help, we can create an
on-site Context Room, an interactive space for audiences to listen to
pre-performance talks, to explore the issues and emotions raised by the play,
and to share their own experiences.
We
want to create a movement around this play—but we need you.



Luna Stage is committed to producing this play, regardless of whether our
entire funding goal is reached.  Whatever funds are raised will go toward
the production, and we will find a way to fund the rest.  We always do. The
show must go on! Without your help,
this will truly be a great stretch for us. 
But with your help, if we are successful in raising $25,000, we will end
our fiscal year on much stronger footing and be in a much better position to
produce the next really important play that comes our way.


At the risk of sounding naive,
the most important thing you get by contributing to our campaign is the joy of
being a part of something positive - something bigger than yourself.  You get to give hope and support to
those who need to know they’re not alone. You get to honor a loved one, gone

This can play out in many ways- through voyeurism, audience tasks, and even one-on-one moments with the performers.</p><p>To date, The Horror Ensemble<i> </i>has created three unique individual horror experiences in three very different spaces. The project has developed an anthology style- with the core ensemble members returning for each show to create an entirely new story and experience in a new space.</p><p>The coming return of The Horror Ensemble will be taking over the entirety of The Athenaeum Theater, resulting in our biggest, baddest, most immersive horror yet. The Athenaeum's scale, style, and historical grandeur will all contribute to the haunting nature of the experience.</p><p>Our hope is that the work of The Horror Ensemble provides an alternative to haunted houses that is grounded in the idea of creating an exciting, engaging, thought-provoking, and terrifying theatrical experience for our audience. </p><p>Dark Day will run October 26th-28th at 10:30PM and Sunday October 29th at 7:30PM.

The style of the event allows audience members to explore different characters and storylines by creating their own path through the experience. This can play out in many ways- through voyeurism, audience tasks, and even one-on-one moments with the performers.To date, The Horror Ensemble has created three unique individual horror experiences in three very different spaces. The project has developed an anthology style- with the core ensemble members returning for each show to create an entirely new story and experience in a new space.The coming return of The Horror Ensemble will be taking over the entirety of The Athenaeum Theater, resulting in our biggest, baddest, most immersive horror yet. The Athenaeum's scale, style, and historical grandeur will all contribute to the haunting nature of the experience.Our hope is that the work of The Horror Ensemble provides an alternative to haunted houses that is grounded in the idea of creating an exciting, engaging, thought-provoking, and terrifying theatrical experience for our audience. Dark Day will run October 26th-28th at 10:30PM and Sunday October 29th at 7:30PM. Tickets are available here: https://web.ovationtix.com/trs/pr/978299What We Need & What You GetMost of our budget is going towards the rental of The Athenaeum, however there are also other expenses that go into building a production, particularly one that attempts to create the most immersive environment possible. Your contributions will be put towards:
Space rental
Creepy costumes
Petrifying props and practical effects (i.e. fake blood and other essentials)
Macabre Marketing/Advertising
Ghostly goodies for the audience
This production has become a labor of love. The team hopes to continue exploring this project simply because we are excited about making new discoveries and working together again to create a bigger and better production for a wider audience. No one involved is being paid from these funds. All contributions will go toward creating a higher quality experience for our audience.Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that most of our supporters are not high rollers.

<p>The money we raise will go towards the numerous costs that are included in production on a show; rehearsal space; costume; make-up; props and promotional material.

<h3>From the seed of an idea to a fully staged production</h3>

Coming to New York's IRT Theater this fall, this adaptation of the Daphne &amp; Apollo myth asks what being a vulnerable human means after our vulnerability is violated.

<p>Short Summary</p>
<p><strong>My name is SaRa Schabach.  I just started a theatre company in the DC area.  I have been involved with all aspects of theatre since I was very young.  I have a degree in Theatre and a Master's degree in Acting from Florida State University.  I worked in NYC for 4 years and just moved last year to Alexandria.  I love my new home and the community that has been so very warm and welcoming.  I do it all. Direct, Act, Build, Design, Choreograph, Stage Manage, Box Office.... you name it, I've done it.  It is time for me to build my own company and I am ready and excited for this enormous challenge.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My company will be for both old and new productions that are written for or by women, those considered minorities, and the LGBT community.  I have a deep passion for Civil Rights.  I'm so confused by the fact that we are still discussing the issue and we need to continue the conversation so that some day it will no longer be an issue.  The best way I know how to do this is through theatre.  I hope that my company will be able to educate, entertain and inspire audience members.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>I want to work.  Being an Actor is difficult.  There are a lot of us out there and not enough work to go around.  Unfortunately, I have also heard horror stories of actor's that do get work being treated terribly.  My company will be a place where I pledge...I promise...all artists will be treated with respect.  I wont tolerate any unkindness through words or action.  It will prove successful because true creativity can only be born in a place that is free of judgment and animosity.  The only intolerance I have is for intolerance.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>This company will also build an extensive community outreach program.  I would like to develop after school programs for low-income students.  I want to donate time to cleaning area parks and streams and entire communities if needed.  Everything from feeding the hungry and clothing the cold.  Although it wont be required for company members to participate in these programs, it will be strongly suggested and those who have already expressed interest are those who would be there to help the community.  Through this outreach program, we can only grow closer together as a company and gain respect for our company with in the community.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>The money donated by you today will go to filing for our tax-exempt non-profit status, building an interactive website, print business cards, make t-shirts to give away for advertising reasons, and making a brochure to hand out in the city, and begin planning the out reach programs.  With your help, Capitol R Company can start with a bang.  Art is very important.  There are many out there who believe it isn’t necessary, but with out all forms of art, we would be less human.  I want to celebrate art and creativity because with out it we are dead inside.  Let's push some buttons.  Let's make people talk.  Let's make people laugh and cry.  Help me in my greatest life changing challenge.  I want to make a difference in the world through performing arts because it is the gift I know I can give.  </strong></p>

<p>In fact, what is home to you? It is a theme that resonates deeply with many of us living in what has become an increasingly global world . With backgrounds spanning from Australia and Taiwan, to Spain and Holland, we are a creative collaborative team of theater practitioners who have found their new home in Berlin and are passionate about the subjects of ‘belonging’ and the ingredients one needs to concoct the true essence of ‘home‘. We, <strong>Thin Skin Theater</strong> in cooperation with production platform <strong>SISYPHOS, DER FLUGELEFANT</strong>, have spent the last year researching, developing and finally brewing these themes which has led to the creation of <strong>BERLIN BOUND</strong>, the theater production we are proud to be premiering  at Kater Holzig in Berlin on November 22, 2012.</p>
<p>We wanted our piece to be performed somewhere that represented the true spirit of Berlin: ""poor but sexy"", alternative, where one can feel free to be who they are and where ""wir haben es nicht nötig, jemand anderer zu sein (we don’t need to be someone we are not). In a city so famous for its underground electro music institutions we felt it important to find a venue that celebrated this egalitarian ethos and so chose <strong>Kater Holzig</strong>, the famous Berlin nightlife wonderland as our venue because of the way they celebrate individuality and inspire in others the hope of a better, more open-minded future.</p>
<p>Your much appreciated support  (be it big or small, sugar or spice) will help us manifest our dream to finally share our simmering recipe with the world! We hope you enjoy this taste of our work.</p>
<p><strong>Your contribution</strong> will help us fund the rent of our venue Kater Holzig, our flyers and posters, props and costumes and rehearsal space and most importantly contribute towards the payment of our collaborative team whose collective imputs have made the development and creation of BERLIN BOUND possible. Your support will help us make our production become a reality. <strong>Herzlichen Dank!</strong></p>

<h3><em><strong> </strong></em></h3>
<p><em><strong>Deathtrap</strong></em> is a play by Ira Levin with many plot twists, even referencing itself as a play within a play. Written in 1978, it holds the record for the longest running comedy-thriller on Broadway and was also nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play. </p>
<p><span>It takes place in the home of Sidney Bruhl, the washed-up playwright who once made fame and fortune with successful murder mysteries for the stage. Now, with a deadly case of writer's block, Sidney plans to murder and steal the script of up-and-comer, Clifford Anderson, whose first play promises to be a smash-hit However, nothing in this play is as it appears. Wives, lawyers and psychics attempt to thwart Sidney's scheme, but no one knows what he's really after or what he'll do to get it.</span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>Deathtrap</strong></em><strong> </strong>requires not only a deflty creative and talented cast, but an intricate set and long list of props including a wall of swords, axes and guns. Our cast includes highly skilled actors Bruce Coen, Lauren Whyte, Jack Sorenson, Hope Garrett Cook, and Wilton Zenon. Your contributions will go toward the construction of the set and the aquisition of props for the production. Any extra funds will be used in other areas of the production (publicity, merchandise, etc.)<br/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Lauren-Reilly Eliot Company, founded by Cooper Helm and Scott Gremillion, is deeply committed and inspired to deliver high-quality theater and film to Lafayette! We believe theatre should not only entertain, but transport audiences to another place, another time. We believe it can be an experience that changes lives and perspectives. Our previous productions include <strong><em>Buried</em> <em>Child</em></strong> and <em><strong>At Home at the Zoo</strong></em><strong>.</strong> </p>

Our cast includes highly skilled actors Bruce Coen, Lauren Whyte, Jack Sorenson, Hope Garrett Cook, and Wilton Zenon. Your contributions will go toward the construction of the set and the aquisition of props for the production. Any extra funds will be used in other areas of the production (publicity, merchandise, etc.)
 
The Lauren-Reilly Eliot Company, founded by Cooper Helm and Scott Gremillion, is deeply committed and inspired to deliver high-quality theater and film to Lafayette! We believe theatre should not only entertain, but transport audiences to another place, another time. We believe it can be an experience that changes lives and perspectives. Our previous productions include Buried Child and At Home at the Zoo.

-       Cover some of the administrative costs in conducting rehearsals, planning, fundraising, publicity, marketing, and running the company this year.

<p>Hello! I'm Bella. I'm an actor. I trained at LAMDA, and have been working professionally in the theatre for over 5 years. This is the first play I have written. It is based on my experience of the deaths of my parents. It is obviously a very personal piece of work, and creating it has been a cathartic process. However, I am sharing it because I think its themes are universal, and I hope the story will connect with many people in lots of different ways. </p>
<p>I am really proud and excited that Will and Ben, the artistic directors at the Tristan Bates Theatre, liked the script enough to include the play in their Camden Fringe programme. I hope that our week-long run this August will be the beginning of a long life for the project. I want to share my story with as many people as possible, and this is an opportunity to showcase the play and generate interest with a view to producing it again in future at other theatres.</p>
<p> I am honoured and thrilled to have an incredibly talented team of creatives working on the project with me:</p>
<h4>DONNACADH O'BRIAIN - DIRECTOR &amp; DRAMATURG</h4>
<p>Donnacadh and I have a rich working history. I have performed in no less than five plays directed by him, and I can tell you from experience that he's brilliant (the reviews above were for two of those previous collaborations) . His insight has been invaluable in helping me develop the script, and making it into something that will be fun to watch. You can read more about his work here: <a href=""http://www.donnacadhobriain.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.donnacadhobriain.co.uk</a></p>
<h4>ESH ALLADI - ACTOR</h4>
<p>Esh is a close friend and an incredibly charismatic performer. Esh also trained at LAMDA, and can currently be seen onstage in <i>The Beaux Stratagem</i> at the National Theatre. On our first day workshopping the play together, he had me so breathless with laughter that I couldn't say my lines. (This could be a problem.)</p>
<h4>ANNA O'GRADY - COMPOSER</h4>
<p>Anna is another close friend. She plays the piano as if music is a magic she has just created, and it could disappear at any moment. The music she makes is beguilingly beautiful. Her score lifts my words to a whole new level. </p>
<h4>ELIZABETH HARPER - DESIGNER</h4>
<div>Elizabeth is a graduate of the MA Theatre Design course at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. She is a talented artist, and she already has some wonderful ideas for building a space in which my story can come to life. I can't wait to see what she creates.</div>
<h4>KEEGAN CURRAN - SOUND DESIGNER</h4>
<div>Keegan is also a graduate of Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. He has nine years' experience of working in theatre and live events, most recently based at Tobacco factory Theatres. Keegan has some great ideas for conjuring the world of the play through sound. </div>
<h4>GEORGIE BARWICK - PRODUCER</h4>
<p>Georgie came to us highly recommended by Will and Ben at the Tristan Bates Theatre after working on <i>The Glasshouse</i> there last year. She is a recent graduate, set to make a big splash in the theatre scene.  She will be pestering the press big-time! </p> <h1>THE MONEY</h1>

THE PEOPLE


BELLA HEESOM - WRITER & ACTOR
Hello! I'm Bella. I'm an actor. I trained at LAMDA, and have been working professionally in the theatre for over 5 years. This is the first play I have written. It is based on my experience of the deaths of my parents. It is obviously a very personal piece of work, and creating it has been a cathartic process. However, I am sharing it because I think its themes are universal, and I hope the story will connect with many people in lots of different ways. 
I am really proud and excited that Will and Ben, the artistic directors at the Tristan Bates Theatre, liked the script enough to include the play in their Camden Fringe programme. I hope that our week-long run this August will be the beginning of a long life for the project. I want to share my story with as many people as possible, and this is an opportunity to showcase the play and generate interest with a view to producing it again in future at other theatres.
 I am honoured and thrilled to have an incredibly talented team of creatives working on the project with me:
DONNACADH O'BRIAIN - DIRECTOR & DRAMATURG
Donnacadh and I have a rich working history. I have performed in no less than five plays directed by him, and I can tell you from experience that he's brilliant (the reviews above were for two of those previous collaborations) . His insight has been invaluable in helping me develop the script, and making it into something that will be fun to watch. You can read more about his work here: www.donnacadhobriain.co.uk
ESH ALLADI - ACTOR
Esh is a close friend and an incredibly charismatic performer. Esh also trained at LAMDA, and can currently be seen onstage in The Beaux Stratagem at the National Theatre. On our first day workshopping the play together, he had me so breathless with laughter that I couldn't say my lines. (This could be a problem.)
ANNA O'GRADY - COMPOSER
Anna is another close friend. She plays the piano as if music is a magic she has just created, and it could disappear at any moment. The music she makes is beguilingly beautiful. Her score lifts my words to a whole new level. 
ELIZABETH HARPER - DESIGNER
Elizabeth is a graduate of the MA Theatre Design course at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. She is a talented artist, and she already has some wonderful ideas for building a space in which my story can come to life. I can't wait to see what she creates.
KEEGAN CURRAN - SOUND DESIGNER
Keegan is also a graduate of Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. He has nine years' experience of working in theatre and live events, most recently based at Tobacco factory Theatres. Keegan has some great ideas for conjuring the world of the play through sound. 
GEORGIE BARWICK - PRODUCER
Georgie came to us highly recommended by Will and Ben at the Tristan Bates Theatre after working on The Glasshouse there last year. She is a recent graduate, set to make a big splash in the theatre scene.  She will be pestering the press big-time!  THE MONEY


Invested so far:

The Yard Theatre in Hackney Wick supported the development of the piece by giving us space for R&D, because they saw the potential of the project. The amazing creatives listed above have generously donated their time and talent because they believe in the project. I (Bella) have invested a significant amount of my personal savings. We have paid the Camden Fringe registration fee. We have hired the theatre. We have had some gorgeous promotional materials designed by the brilliant Rebecca Pitt. This is happening! And now...
What we need:
We need your help to pay for  the following:



Rehearsal space hire

Set and costume
Printing promotional materials (posters & fliers)
Expenses for the creatives making the show happen
Boring practical costs (public liability insurance etc)

Anything you can give will help. We have calculated that we need £2,000 to cover the above. If we raise more, then we will pay everyone involved for their hard work.
To show our IMMENSE APPRECIATION of your kind generosity in helping to make My World Has Exploded A Little Bit  the best play it can be, we are offering some lovely PERKS to donors! Take a look at the list on the right :)

</p><p>Who is David Shepherd?</p><p>Born in New York City, David Shepherd studied
English at Harvard and received an M.A. in the History of Theatre at 
Columbia University. Disenchanted with what he perceived
as a European dominated theatre on the east coast, Shepherd gravitated 
to the Midwest.  In 1953, Shepherd was one of the founders
of the Playwrights Theatre Club in Chicago. 
In 1955, with Paul Sills, he founded the Compass Players, the forerunner
 of Second City.<br/></p><p>Compass launched the careers of Ed Asner, Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Jerry
Stiller, Alan Alda, Alan Arkin, Barbara Harris, and Shelley Berman (to name a
few) and started a revolution in entertainment. In 1972, David formed Group
Creativity Projects, a non-profit organization which enables amateurs and
professionals to improvise their own plays, movies, radio shows, poetry and
novellas.  Along with Howard Jerome in 1972, David designed and produced
the Improv Olympics - a performance sport which premiered in New
 York City and later spawned a citywide competition in Chicago during the early
1980s.</p>
<p>The Improv Olympics was adapted in Ottawa
as the Canadian Improv Games (CIG) by Willie Wyllie and Howard Jerome. 
Now in its 38th year, CIG is part of the curriculum for over 300 Canadian high
schools nation wide.  Since the inception of Group Creativity Projects,
David has invented countless other improv formats including the Responsive
Scene Radio Show (listeners create their own stories on air) and MOVIExperience
(improvising a movie) which culminated in the publication of his book “That
Movie In Your Head.”  That book was the inspiration for Nancy Fletcher's
non-profit organization Act Now, which adapted David's work by creating a movie
making format for adolescent girls designed to enhance leadership and
self-esteem.  His latest format is Life-Play, where people improvise over
the phone.</p>
<p>David's work has influenced  Second
 City, the Groundlings,
Upright Citizen's Brigade, i.O.,  Saturday Night Live, MadTV, and the work
of film directors such as Christopher Guest, Paul Mazursky, Mike Nichols and
Henry Jaglom. David has been presented with lifetime achievement awards by Second City,
Canadian Improv Games and Chicago Improv Fest.</p>

I have known David Shepherd for 43 years and have been directly
involved or a consultant on every format he's created since 1972.  I co-produced and wrote a documentary about David,
called ""David Shepherd: A Lifetime of Improvisational Theatre."" In
the improv community, I'm known as his protege. I can say with confidence that
I am an expert on David's career and life.<br/><br/><p>David, who is now 90 years old, has asked me to collect, characterize and
prepare his archives for permanent placement in a publicly accessible
collection.  I have completed an initial review of those archival
materials, and put those materials into 10 boxes. Those boxes contain 60 years
of David's improv formats.  The boxes include vintage pictures, journals, flyers,
scripts, press releases, posters, awards, correspondence, video and audio
tapes.  David's archives are under consideration for being added to Northwestern University Library's Special Collections, which houses the Viola Spolin Collection.<br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, his archives are in a shambles. Over the years, improv material has
been misfiled and merged with family memorabilia. I have to separate family
material from improv, while identifying little known formats and rearrange the
memorabilia in a coherent order. This is a major undertaking, where I plan on spending seven to ten days at David's home to
accomplish this task.  I live in Los Angeles. David resides in Belchertown, Mass.
</p>

This project will benefit everyone in the improv
community and many in the broader U.S. theatre community. David
Shepherd's work will be preserved for posterity. Quite simply, David Shepherd
is a man who changed the course of American Theatre. We all deserve to have his
archives carefully and comprehensively collected, sorted, cataloged and 
made available to academics and other students of the history of American
Theatre.<br/><br/>The $5,000 I am hoping to raise will cover the following expenses;<br/><br/>Airfare (Los Angeles to Massachusetts) <br/>Car rental/gas<br/>Hotel<br/>Food<br/>Scanning/shipping<br/>Interns to assist with cataloging<br/>My stipend (which covers work I have already accomplished since 2009)<br/><br/><br/></div>","Who is David Shepherd?Born in New York City, David Shepherd studied

She asked, ""How can dance education reach underserved populations, and how can trained dancers use their skill set to give back to the world?""In three years, we have reached our dream of developing a sustainable dance education program. With a group of dedicated and passionate volunteers, we are changing lives through dance.                                                                                                 


                                                                



                                                                    


Our dance diplomats are U.S. dancers who teach dance in underserved populations in Panama, the U.S., and soon to be India with your support. Dance diplomats teach in orphanages, at-risk youth foundations, and universities. We are nurturing a community of service-minded dancers.

Shanawaz was seven years old and a polio victim when he arrived at SEC. 20 years later, despite being wheel-chair bound, he became the assistant teacher to acclaimed Bollywood dancer, Shiamakdavar. Inspired by the power of dance, he began teaching the many children at SEC Day School to dance and move beyond their conditions.Shanawaz and the SEC Day School recently presented a dance piece and won 1st Prize from The Create Foundation - Trophy for Artistic Excellence.                                                   Ek Prayaas—“an effort” in Hindi— supports, educates, and develops the lives of underprivileged children in West Bengal. Housing 130 children between the ages of four and fourteen, Ek Prayaas offers both academic and vocational training, with a mission to advance “literacy into learning.” Movement Exchange will provide dance education to Ek Prayaas in alliance with the local Kolkata dance school, DNA Danceworks. We believe the best way to immerse our sustainable model into new communities is by first developing partnerships with local established dance leaders. 
       
  These are two partnerships that Movement Exchange has cultivated in India thus far. With YOUR support, we will continue to build the formative connections necessary to unite communities and empower youth through the universal language of dance.                                                                

Movement Exchange is committed to understanding, with empathy and integrity, the communities in which we serve. Your donation will contribute to the research required to provide sensitive and customized dance education that is relevant to the physical, developmental, and emotional needs of our participants.  
                                                               In the same way we have established our Panama program, Movement Exchange maintains sustainable impact as a number one priority. Not only will we bring dance diplomats to new communities in India for outreach and exchange, but we will ensure sustainable dance education for at-risk youth in two main ways:                                           Igniting local interactions— empowering         Donating to our partners, and relationships between local Indian dancers      employing local Indian dancersand at-risk youth foundations by creating        to give back to their owndance education programs that did not           communites. previously exist.       
                   










                             
                            


            



    
     
         All donations are tax-deductible, and our perks are pretty awesome.",76.0,6,"1 Campaign

This August 23 -27th, 2011 for 5 performances,we return to our Edmonton roots,(on the heels of of Pagliacci staged inside the famed Circus and Sideshow in Coney Island)and the heart of Little Italy, to present Puccini's timeless classic Madame Butterfly, a tearjerker about Cho cho san the teenaged geisha with a heart of gold, and Lieutenant Pinkerton, the US Naval Officer who breaks it. In one night Mercury Opera will transport you to the romantic,the beautiful, the exotic and ultimately the tragic, in an exquisite rendition of Puccini's tale spun with a new twist and fresh air setting in post World War 2 Japan, during the US occupation.

We want to create a yearly opera festival that will be enjoyed during the summer in Edmonton, as an adjunct to the already existing festival base.
