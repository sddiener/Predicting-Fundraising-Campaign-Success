<h3>WTF is GRRRL? And Why Should You Support Us?</h3>
<p>We are GRRRL, a revolutionary clothing company for women,  and we’re changing the goddamn game! We’ve been busting our vag for 2 years straight, winning awards every year in our short life, and along the way, have built an incredible army of women with a crystal clear mission and vision.</p>
<p>We passionately believe that women have to be free to reach their potential if we are to have any  chance of saving this world. And to help us, to help more women reach that potential, we need funding.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/DiM1BKw6WRk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The clothing is the highest quality. lowest price and we have totally rewritten all the rules of fashion:</div>
<p><strong>No photoshop. No body discrimination. No fat shaming. No ethnicity, religious, gender identity, or body type discrimination. No models only athletes. No sizes.</strong></p>
<p>Because it's time to call bullshit on the evil that comes from fashion and create something that genuinely has positive outcomes.</p>
</div></div>
<p>Instead of raising money through predominantly male venture capitalists who couldn’t give a flying fuck about why we exist, we’re coming to you, the people. </p>
<p>We believe in win + win relationships, and know you will feel empowered, and may even feel a sense of purpose, in having a hand in rewriting HERSTORY. </p>
<p>Support <strong>US</strong> &gt; we will reward <strong>YOU</strong> with an amazing piece of GRRRL Gear &gt; we will take <strong>OUR</strong> life changing live experience on the road.</p>
<p>So, when you support the growth of our mission, we will give you an amazing item from our range in return for your support. And take our life changing live event on the road to five cities in the USA and make access to the event completely free of charge.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520661666/hpciines1uuiqejgieri.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Every pledge of support will count, and the region with the most numbers of supporters will get the live experience events.</p>
<h3><strong>The Self-Love Rebellion Project</strong></h3>
<p><strong>It's really more than win:win. It's win:win:win.</strong></p>
<p>Support our growth.</p>
<p>Get an amazing piece of clothing or one of our accessories, and</p>
<p>We will take self love on the road.</p>
<p>Will you stand with us? We didn't get to where we are today alone. All along there has been an Army of women driving us forward. We need YOU to help us keep the momentum going.</p>
<div>Last year our first annual event in Las Vegas, helped women from around the world change their lives indefinitely.  It was a combination of experience sharing, teaching, seminars and interactive sessions.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Women quit their 9-5 job on the drive home, and start their own company the next day; created new best friends; Stopped abusing their bodies; Found freedom from self-harm; Made a connection they've never felt before.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So if you fund us, we won't just reward you with our something amazing from the award winning GRRRL. We'll also get that show on the road.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And it will be entrance fee free so every woman will be able to access the community, support and empowerment they need.</div>
<div> </div>

<p>$85,000 will give us the funding we need and kick off the tour and in the process, create thousands of foot soldiers, to deliver a series of projects that will ultimately change the future for women around the world. </p>
<p>The tour will consist of day long events hosted by our MFCEO, Kortney Olson, key note speakers, educators, trainers and accompanied by our resident photographers and videographers to capture and share your experiences and stories, GRRRL Athletes, fun, food, and life changing experiences. And the events will be streamed live to send the self-love message around the world.</p>
<p>Free of cost, the day events will be open to anyone aged 13 and up who is living and presenting as Female.  The numbers of attendees will be open to as many as humanly possible, with location and details, driven by the votes of our campaign supporters, announced once the campaign has concluded.  <strong>The tour will come to the region with the greatest number of supporters. Every perk purchase will count towards bringing the tour to your region. </strong></p>
<p><strong>If we smash through that target we have more self-love for the world, local community groups, more roadshows, digital self love courses, a new self loving social media platform and a hundred more projects we can fund to take self love to the world.</strong></p>

Getting<br/>tired of being broke and spending hundreds on bathing suits, I<br/>decided to borrow my mom’s sewing machine and make my own. It<br/>was a little rough around the edges because my sewing skills were<br/>not top notch, but the design was what I wanted so I began wearing<br/>them to the beach.</p>
<p><img alt=""5$ perk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i143.photobucket.com/albums/r142/ginienos/7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div> My friends really liked it and asked for suits. Pretty soon I had more requests so I slapped up a page online and started getting orders. I had to work to get my sewing to a higher standard, so my mom spent some time with me and I got better. Orders started picking up. But hey, it’s only me and my mom’s old machine so it began to get hectic.</div>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i143.photobucket.com/albums/r142/ginienos/5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Then my parents sprung for a new machine of my own.<br/>This was a big deal, because my parents never handed me anything.<br/>After I began getting orders I set up a bank account and the savings<br/>began to pile up. I knew I had to pay back my parents back but as a<br/>teenage girl, you need gas money to get to the beach.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i143.photobucket.com/albums/r142/ginienos/3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My suits are now becoming more popular. I have always followed<br/>fashion and bikini design. But they’re ridiculously expensive. Plus, they<br/>aren’t even made in Hawaii. There is so much creative talent but it’s<br/>really hard to turn that talent into something succesfull. I’m trying to<br/>do that and I want to be an inspiration to other young designers and<br/>show them that they can do this too.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i143.photobucket.com/albums/r142/ginienos/coininside.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I’m getting orders not only from Hawaii, but all across America. And now<br/>the word is spreading. What’s really important to me is<br/>that I can make them fast at an affordable price, wherever they may<br/>be.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i143.photobucket.com/albums/r142/ginienos/cointop.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So what makes my bikini line special? Well, several things, starting<br/>with current design trends, photos, great friends, and a pretty<br/>wide social network. And the fact that a high school student is doing<br/>it. Plus the obvious; quality and price. Living in Hawaii is special.<br/>too. I can get great photos of my friends having a blast and wearing<br/>Akela Swim suits. My friends are awesome, they really support me with pictures, and they help spread the word with posts and IGs.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i143.photobucket.com/albums/r142/ginienos/4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And, why am I here on Indiegogo with a campaign?</p>
<p>Well, it’s time to up my game and I need a little boost.

<p> </p></div>","My name is Nina and I am a high school senior in Hawaii. Gettingtired of being broke and spending hundreds on bathing suits, Idecided to borrow my mom’s sewing machine and make my own. Itwas a little rough around the edges because my sewing skills werenot top notch, but the design was what I wanted so I began wearingthem to the beach.

 My friends really liked it and asked for suits. Pretty soon I had more requests so I slapped up a page online and started getting orders. I had to work to get my sewing to a higher standard, so my mom spent some time with me and I got better. Orders started picking up. But hey, it’s only me and my mom’s old machine so it began to get hectic.

Then my parents sprung for a new machine of my own.This was a big deal, because my parents never handed me anything.After I began getting orders I set up a bank account and the savingsbegan to pile up. I knew I had to pay back my parents back but as ateenage girl, you need gas money to get to the beach.

My suits are now becoming more popular. I have always followedfashion and bikini design. But they’re ridiculously expensive. Plus, theyaren’t even made in Hawaii. There is so much creative talent but it’sreally hard to turn that talent into something succesfull. I’m trying todo that and I want to be an inspiration to other young designers andshow them that they can do this too.

I’m getting orders not only from Hawaii, but all across America. And nowthe word is spreading. What’s really important to me isthat I can make them fast at an affordable price, wherever they maybe.

So what makes my bikini line special? Well, several things, startingwith current design trends, photos, great friends, and a prettywide social network. And the fact that a high school student is doingit. Plus the obvious; quality and price. Living in Hawaii is special.too. I can get great photos of my friends having a blast and wearingAkela Swim suits. My friends are awesome, they really support me with pictures, and they help spread the word with posts and IGs.

And, why am I here on Indiegogo with a campaign?
Well, it’s time to up my game and I need a little boost. I think a realisticway to do that is to start by asking for enough funds for a newprofessional sewing machine and an updated website that can showcase my line and handle the orders. The home sewing machine and generic web sites I am sellingthrough just aren’t cutting it anymore. I want to do better. I’m at thatpoint where I have outgrown my equipment.
 
Right now I have less than a year before starting college.My family is not super rich, that means I will have to work my waythrough college. Tuition is one thing, spending money is another.How many times have I had to hear from my parents that they hadjobs in college. They have really encouraged me to continue with my businessso that I don’t have to wash dishes, or flip burgers, or compete fora job. Plus, jobs are really hard to get right now. With my bikinibusiness I have my own job, I’m building business skills, and I amshowing people that it can still be done.
This will all come in steps, the success of one leading up to the next.Right now I am well pass the bottom and asking you for your supportin my next step up to better equipment. Thanks forchecking us out. Aloha and Mahalo.

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Short Summary</span></h3>
<p>Rose Lin has been designing and making handcrafted jewelry by herself for years now. She started out just making a few pieces and selling them in a small stand. However, she has slowly expanded her catalogue and now her jewelry has been apart of art and craft exhibitions and she's had her products sold in botiques and department stores. To her, it's not about the jewelry or the money, but about following her dream and having her art make people happy.  Recently some of her American friends, decided to help her expand her reach and truly realize her goal. Our international team is working now to bring her dream to life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to use the money to buy new materials so she can make even better designs. She's been invited to new exhibiitons and shows, but she needs to have more of her jewelry ready made for the shows. Furthermore, if we can raise enough funds, we can sell directly to consumers and expand our reach. We can open our own store, attend more international art and craft exhibitions and negotiate better deals through third party sellers. </p>
<p>We are offering our most popular products in exchange for your support. We are giving them at a discounted rate with shipping included in the cost.  You will be our first global customers and the first outside of Asia to own a piece of handcrafted art. </p>

<p>First, we need to increase our inventory so that we can fulfill orders. Currently we only have a limited supply of shirts and have to produce on an as ordered basis which slows down delivery time. We want to have enough back stock to ship orders as they come in and keep production moving. We feel that $2000 can get us to that point.</p>
<p>Second, we want to develop new products. These products will include new colors, shirt styles, new phrases, hoodies, hats, and stickers. The development costs for all of this are estimated around $3000 to start small production runs of each of these.</p>
<p>Finally, The last $2500 would go towards website development, marketing, packaging and operating costs. We want to make your experience with brand:me the best possible. This includes a simple to use website with a feeling of community and acceptence, simple checkout processes and amazing graphic design. Plus, we want to be able to share it with the world!</p>
<p>If we don't make our goal of $7500 then we will start from the top and work our way down. The main goal is to aquire inventory. We need to be able to get this product into your hands. </p>
<p>For the contributors, we will set aside specific amounts to fulfill your chosen perk. Even if we aren't able to make full runs of new products the contributors will get limited editions of the perk they chose. </p>

Hundred for Hope

Hundred for Hope is a 100 mile bike ride created by one father to prove to his 4 year old daughter than she can do anything she sets her mind to. Through this ride we are working with Stand Against Suicide, an organization out of New York, to raise awareness for suicide prevention. 20% of brand:me website Hundred for Hope sales go toward helping this event and its mission.
Stand Against Suicide is a nonprofit organization started in 2011. Their Mission is to raise suicide awareness and prevention by educating about suicide and mental illness. They are dedicated to promoting alternatives to suicide through education and awareness. They also distribute awareness and educational materials to schools, colleges, businesses and to the general public. 100% of profits go back into the organization.

Bee stands at a diameter of 24 mm (size of a US Quarter) and a thickness of 8mm (thickness of a pencil).</li></ul><p><strong>How many cards can I store on the Bee?</strong></p><ul><li>You can store up to 20 cards on your Bee. This includes your credit cards, debit cards and prepaid cards. In future Bee users can expect to store access control cards, and transit cards.</li></ul><p><strong>How secure is my Radiius Bee?</strong></p><ul><li>Bee is equipped with a biometric fingerprint scanner that makes sure you are the one true user of your Bee. You can store multiple fingerprint information and unlock the device any time before using your Bee.The security of Bee is more nuanced and in layers. It has a biometric fingerprint scanner, it conforms to EMV Co. standards and it uses tokens instead of PAN (or real card numbers) during transactions.In addition, Radiius does not store any sensitive information on your smartphone. All data communication is encrypted with strong keys end-to-end. We consider these as basic hygiene.</li></ul><p><strong>Does my Bee require charging?</strong></p><ul><li>Bee does not require charging, and is expected to work for two years with normal usage.</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><u>BEEHIVE APP</u></strong></p><p><strong>What is BeeHive?</strong></p><ul><li>BeeHive is a one stop Android/iOS solution that lets you add, delete, update and manage your cards for use with Bee. BeeHive is a safe and secure solution and does not store your complete payment card info anywhere in your phone or outside Bee.In future, BeeHive plans to include money management and expense tracking solutions as well as advise Bee users on where to get the best deals and offers.</li></ul><p><strong>Can my Bee connect to more than one smartphone at the same time?</strong></p><ul><li>For safety’s sake, one Bee wallet or account can only be linked with one smartphone at a time, to make sure only you have access to your card information.</li></ul><p> </p><p><u><strong>USING BEE</strong></u></p><p><strong>How do I add cards to my Bee?</strong></p><ul><li>Bee works in sync with the BeeHive, and BeeHive gives you an option to scan your cards or manually enter the details. BeeHive works in the background with bank applications to get the secured credentials and store them on Bee.</li></ul><p><strong>Can I upload both my credit and debit cards to Bee?</strong></p><ul><li>Yes, you can upload debit, credit, pre-paid, rewards and loyalty cards to Bee</li></ul><p><strong>Can I add my new bank card before it arrives from the bank via postal/mail service?</strong></p><ul><li>Yes banks can deliver new cards directly to the Bee device via the mobile application. What we mean here is that banks do not have to go through the process of issuing plastic cards and shipping it to consumers. They can directly provide tokens for the new cards to the Bee device through the Bee app on the mobile.</li></ul><p><strong>Do I need a smartphone to use the Bee?</strong></p><ul><li>To manage cards, activating Bee and registering your fingerprint information, you’re going to need the BeeHive app. For a payment transaction on PoS terminals, you do not need the BeeHive app.</li></ul><p><strong>What brands of smart watches can Bee attach to?</strong></p><ul><li>All android and iOS based smart watches can pair with the Bee Device.</li></ul><p><strong>Where can I use my Bee?</strong></p><ul><li>Anywhere, everywhere. As long as the retailer you’re paying at has a PoS device that supports contactless payments, your Bee will work flawlessly.In future, you may be able to use your Bee instead of ID cards that require NFC-security walkthrough, and instead of your regular transit ticket.</li></ul><p><strong>How do I make a purchase using Bee?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Look for a terminal that has NFC sign on it.- Unlock the Bee by placing your finger on the sensor.</li>
<li>Bring it close to the terminal and complete the verification (signature, if needed)</li>
<li>That’s it!</li>
</ul><p><strong>What transit tickets can Bee integrate with? (i.e. Metro Card, Charlie Card, Tap Card, etc. )</strong></p><ul><li>Any transit card or access card that uses NFC reader at the turnstile can be integrated on the Bee device </li></ul><p><strong>I have multiple cards enrolled in my Bee. How do I know which card is being used?</strong></p><ul><li>The BeeHive app on your smartphone allows you to identify your default card. Once you mark your default card, the Bee pre-selects this card during payment. You can, of course, always select another card as your default anytime.</li></ul><p><strong>Will all features and functionalities be available when I receive my Bee?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Support for Transit, Access and Location based rewards would be future releases that will be updated via App updates or FOTA (firmware over the air) updates to a user's existing Bee device</li>
<li>Additionally, while Radiius would like to ensure support from most of the large banks and issuers, some banks may not be immediately supported at the time of our launch. Similarly, our network partner may have either readiness issues or may require additional approvals to support us in some countries and geographical regions. </li>
</ul><p> </p><p><u><strong>PROBLEM RESOLUTION</strong></u></p><p><strong>What if my Bee stops working?</strong></p><ul><li>Your Bee comes with a 1 year warranty, that lets you replace your device in case there are any manufacturing defects. We guarantee you receive your Bee free of manufacturing defects.</li></ul><p><strong>I lost my Bee. What should I do now?</strong></p><ul><li>Losing anything valuable can be stressful. But you need not worry about misuse of Bee. It has multiple layers of security.Bee cannot be used without your biometrics. If any unauthorized person tries to use your Bee, it will permanently lock itself after 10 wrong tries.Next, you can disable all the cards on Bee by using ‘Disable all cards’ feature in BeeHive. Your physical cards will continue to work.You can call and ask for a replacement. You will have to pay the cost of a new Bee in your account. Radiius is planning a 24-hour replacement program for most metro locations in the United States.</li></ul><p><strong>How do I restore my cards on the replaced Bee?</strong></p><ul><li>Simply open the BeeHive app and activate your replacement Bee as before. The enrolled cards will automatically synch up with your new Bee and will be restored.</li></ul><p><strong>What if I change my smartphone?</strong></p><ul><li>You will need to go through a simple process to link your new smartphone with Bee. As a part of it, we will verify you as the right owner of the Bee. Since, we do not store any payment information on the phone, the process is very secure.This is where you get the freedom and peace of mind. You are not tied to a phone company or model in order to continue using your Bee.</li></ul><p><strong>Can I use Bee to withdraw cash at an ATM?</strong></p><ul><li>Very few ATM machines work on NFC. If your ATM machine supports NFC, Bee will work.</li></ul><p><strong>Can a transaction decline while using the Bee?</strong></p><ul><li>If a transaction declines, it would most like be due to a server issue on your card providers’ end. None of your transaction information goes through our servers in real time.</li></ul><p> </p><p><u><strong>ORDERING</strong></u></p><p><strong>How much does a Bee cost?</strong></p><ul><li>Stay tuned for early-bird offers.</li></ul><p><strong>Can I buy more than one Bee?</strong></p><ul><li>Yes, of course! The more, the merrier. You can link all your Bees to a single BeeHive wallet (on your smartphone) and they would behave exactly like each other. So carry one on your watch, one in your handbag and one as your key fob. We leave this to your imagination.</li></ul><p><strong>How do I pre-order a Bee?</strong></p><ul><li>You can pre-order through our Indiegogo campaign or directly through our website.</li></ul><p><strong>Can I invite friends and family to try the Bee?</strong></p><ul><li>Certainly, you can. You can invite people who have not yet purchased a Bee. At Radiius, we are pushing for the convenience of a cashless, cardless, hassle-free lifestyle.</li></ul><p><strong>When will the Bee ship?</strong></p><ul><li>The first batch is expected to ship out in February 2018.</li></ul><p><strong>Can I choose any color?</strong></p><ul><li>Bee comes in stylish and sporty colors, some of them are limited in number. You can choose which color you want while placing the pre-order.</li></ul><p><strong>I am outside the US. When can I get my Bee?</strong></p><ul><li>If you’re outside the US, please subscribe to Bee updates and we’ll let you know when we can ship you your Bee.</li></ul><p><strong>Can I change or cancel my perk?</strong></p><ul><li>Indiegogo has now made it easier than ever to upgrade your perks. You can now do so on the contributions tab of your Indiegogo profile. See more information on how to do this for Indiegogo here:<strong> <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526756-How-to-Upgrade-Your-Perk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526756-How-to-Upgrade-Your-Perk</a> </strong>Regarding cancellations, Indiegogo policy dictates that campaign owners have no ability to adjust perk selections. Backers can upgrade, change, or cancel their perks/rewards at any time on their contributor's profile until the campaign has closed. After the campaign has ended and funds have been disbursed, the campaigners will evaluate such requests will be handled on a case-by-case basis.</li></ul><p><strong>How is shipping handled?</strong></p><ul><li>We will be shipping via the United States Postal Service First Class mail with delivery tracking confirmation. International shipments will be sent via International First Class.</li></ul><p><strong>How much is shipping and handling?</strong></p><ul><li>Shipping is decided based upon which perk you choose for your contribution. We recommend choosing perks which offer free shipping and best value.</li></ul><p><strong>Will I be able to replace my Bee battery after two years?</strong></p><ul><li>Bee devices would need to be reordered after two years. we are working a replacement solution that allows for change of battery every year.</li></ul><p> </p><p><u><strong>REGULATORY</strong></u></p><p><strong>Is Bee certified by any authority?</strong></p><ul><li>Yes. It is EMV Co. certified and the solution is approved by payment networks (MasterCard and Visa). The Radiius ecosystem including all applications hosted on cloud are compliant with Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards.</li></ul><p><strong>If Bee is ever hacked and I have money stolen or unauthorized payments from the device, will your company cover the funds lost?</strong></p><ul><li>Bee conforms to all security standards in vogue by the concerned authorities (EMV Co). These standards are globally accepted and recognized by banks and card issuing authorities and better than the security currently in place for cards. Effectively this means that current treatment viz unauthorized transactions will apply. That means - consumers right/ ability to contest and refute a transaction are intact. In cases of losses due to such conflicts, the original card issuing authority owns the liability.</li></ul></div>","In October of 2015, business and financial institutions were required to implement stricter security protocols (called the liability shift) for payments that switched away from magnetic-stripe cards which paved the way for safer payments. In light of the many recent credit card data breaches, now is an especially good time to present a solution that finally shields our wallets from theft and fraud.

<p>A Mobile Device sold today no longer includes a user manual.<span>  However, manuals provided with a mobile
device in the past didn’t really help understanding how to use all those
functions anyway.  Unless you happen to
be Tech-Savvy, they can understand the techno-talk used in these manuals.  For the Non-Tech-Savvy this techno-talk
was/is the same as a foreign language and they may hold a master’s degree.</span></p>
<p>The gap between Tech-Savvy and Non-Tech-Savvy is revealed
further in “simple” basic functions.<span>  Basic
functions of a mobile device are now managed by applications (Apps), which are
small programs on the device identified by an icon.  You must be able to identify and master these
apps with or without the help of a manual. Some app names are self-descriptive
and some are not. Many of these basic apps also have alternatives, referred to
as third-party-apps, which are not designed by the manufacturer of that device
but an outside vendor. Some of these alternative apps are actually better than
the basic apps provided by the manufacturer and some not.</span></p>

<p>
</p>
<p>So we have the Technology-Savvy or Tech-Savvy in society,
defined in the dictionary as “knowing a lot about technology, especially
computers” and the Non-Tech-Savvy who are actually not defined.<span>  When the term Non-Tech-Savvy is used, it
commonly refers to seniors, though a large part of this group are not seniors.  The Non-Tech-Savvy members of society does
include seniors but it also includes those of many ages, educational level,
income level and language that just don’t know a lot about technology of any
kind.  The population of the
Non-Tech-Savvy has been estimated to be as large as the Tech-Savvy, but no-one
actually knows.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>AARP
reports 64 percent of their members are “very uncomfortable with technology,
for many digital immigrants the path to becoming smarter than a smartphone many
require a little instruction”. (This percentage equates to millions in the
world’s population)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Eighty-one percent of U.S. cell phone users send text
messages, but only half of them tackle more complex tasks like downloading apps
and reading or sending email. These Non-Tech-Savvy are usually not accounted
for in media releases and are the non-senior in the Non-Tech-Savvy population.

so many Non-Tech-Savvy members of society, it truly surprises me that so-very few
seem to care about the dilemma they face every day.<span>  Taken for granted are the benefits and
potential benefits mobile devices can provide for the Non-Tech-Savvy.  Benefits such as reminders (medicine, meals, appointment,
etc.), emergencies, announcements, keeping in touch with loved ones and
services. But does society voice a real
concern for this dilemma, No!  Shame on
you!</span></p><p>Each
and every one of you (Including media journalists, authors &amp; writers)
reading this campaign has a family member or friend that is Non-Tech-Savvy.<span>  Only a few scant articles have made note of
it.  Do not treat this as trivial,
consider who they really are, people you care about!  These are some of the most important members
of society and they deserve your support.</span></p><p>
</p><p><u>Current Status</u></p>
<p>Since introduction of the mobile device, manufacturers and
sellers marketing strategies have been designed for the Tech-Savvy, leaving
Non-Tech-Savvy members of society to fend for themselves.<span>  Sellers have made small attempts to address
this problem in various ways. They identify YouTube videos that tell you how a
particular device works. Some will
provide a free clinic in which <u>they</u> tell you how best to use a
particular device. Some identify online
resources where you can download a PDF version of the manual and some sellers
will provide a PDF app of the manual on the device. Unfortunately none of these
efforts really take into consideration their customer base, Tech-Savvy and
Non-Tech-Savvy.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, manufacturers of mobile devices have made
no attempts at all to address this dilemma. To the contrary, they no longer
provide the lowly cousin to a mobile device, the user’s manual.<span>  Now, supposedly, they are developing a
marketing strategy aimed at the Non-Tech-Savvy. 
How do they expect the Non-Tech-Savvy to learn how to use current and
future mobile devices without any effective means of instruction?</span></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/658776/files/20140618163714-Going_Green1.jpg?1403134634"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
</p><p>Why did manufacturers of mobile devices stop providing users
manuals?<span>  They referred to this event as
“Going Green”, saving trees and the forest. 
Which is true, for every device they were including a small booklet that
was eventually going to be thrown away. 
If it was effective as an instructional document or not is a question
only the reader can answer.  But the
manufacturer saved millions of dollars by not including a manual.  What green are they saving?  Who is pay the price for this savings? </span></p>

<p>Another aspect of the Non-Tech-Savvy, is an individual’s
reading comprehension level which some may wish were better.<span>  Social City Net understands this as part of
the Non-Tech-Savvy dilemma and designed an Interactive Webinar Class which we
feel best addresses this global issue. </span></p>
<p>Our Webinar’s allow a person to log into an Interactive
Class from anywhere in the world, and actively participate in a presentation, question

with maximum of 15 students and is offered multiple times over a period of days
and weeks based on demand. </p>
<p>The structure of each device presentation is based on the
device manual but presented in an easy to understand manner while allowing for
questions and answers from each class member. Each webinar is recorded and added to a video
library which any member can access for playback at any time in the future.<span>  Webinars are facilitated by an expert on the
specific device scheduled for that class. Individuals book a class thru the Social City
Net website which shows a schedule of classes, dates &amp; times for selected

<p>I
have worked in Software Development and Business Analysis for over 15 years,
with expertise in programming and project management. The purchase of a
smartphone for my daughter and her/our frustrations learning to use it began
this project. Social City Net is
centered on the website, it provides class description, scheduling, booking and
client information. Taking the website through concept, design and finally
construction has been quite a journey.</p>
<p>I
believe Social City Net is an awesome concept and this campaign is a funding
effort, but it also conveys a serious message.<span> 
The Non-Tech-Savvy face a serious dilemma every day for no reason and
without a voice to raise an alarm.  You
might think this trivial today but tomorrow hopefully you will see it is not.</span></p>
<p>If
you feel it’s a great idea but aren't able to contribute financially, no
problem. There are so many other ways to help out. We appreciate those who
tell us they talk about Social City Net with people they meet. It helps us
when people join in on our social media pages to ""like"", comment,
share, tweet, and pin. We have to give a special shout out to our wonderful
Facebook fans who have formed a sort of grass roots movement to help spread the
word. Thank you to each and every one of you!<b>  </b><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pub/anthony-ferguson-sr/10/175/256/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><span><u>LinkedIn</u></span></b></a></p>

Which is true, for every device they were including a small booklet that
was eventually going to be thrown away. 
If it was effective as an instructional document or not is a question
only the reader can answer.  But the
manufacturer saved millions of dollars by not including a manual.  What green are they saving?  Who is pay the price for this savings? 

Social City Net
Another aspect of the Non-Tech-Savvy, is an individual’s
reading comprehension level which some may wish were better.  Social City Net understands this as part of
the Non-Tech-Savvy dilemma and designed an Interactive Webinar Class which we
feel best addresses this global issue. 
Our Webinar’s allow a person to log into an Interactive
Class from anywhere in the world, and actively participate in a presentation, question
& answer session from the privacy of their own home or location. Each class covers a specific mobile device
with maximum of 15 students and is offered multiple times over a period of days
and weeks based on demand. 
The structure of each device presentation is based on the
device manual but presented in an easy to understand manner while allowing for
questions and answers from each class member. Each webinar is recorded and added to a video
library which any member can access for playback at any time in the future.  Webinars are facilitated by an expert on the
specific device scheduled for that class. Individuals book a class thru the Social City
Net website which shows a schedule of classes, dates & times for selected
mobile devices. 
Details on how to connect to your webinar emailed to you at
the time a class is booked, connection details are also provided on the website’s
side menu.

Support Needed For
Business
functions currently in place include Website, Scheduling & Booking, Basic
Internet Marketing and 256 Bit SSL Website Security (This is high level
security is required for a website that accepts credit cards to protect
personal verification information). For
a 3 month period, funding will secure:

Office
Space – In McClellan Park, formally McClellan Air Force Base, where $7,143
(2,381 per month) will provide 3 months to firmly establish this service
location in Sacramento California.  This location
provides a financial advantage as utilities are included in this monthly fee.
Staffing
for 3 Months – Systems technician $6,960, Facilitator (commission), Founder (military
retirement)
Office
requirements for 3 Months – Furniture $800, Equipment $650, Communications $550

Expanded
Marketing - $1,300

There are 6 unique perks for donations 
(1)  $5 (Support) –
Receive a special thanks and our appreciation, 
(2) $25 (Copper) – Receive a special thanks and entry on our
sponsorship page, 
(3) $100 (Bronze) – Receive Copper perks and a 1 year
membership, 
(4) $500 (Silver) – Receive Bronze perks and a free class of
your choice, 
(5) $1000 (Gold) – Receive Silver perks and your image in
our Sponsorship image slider, 
(6) $5000 (Platinum) – Receive Gold perks and your name on
our classroom.
If
the entire goal is not met I will still go forward with the business, and funds
collected will go towards additional marketing, facility and office
requirements. I am confident the shortfall can be covered by sales and a loan
with operations on a month by month basis. This will be a much slower startup
with exposure to a higher risk but I refuse to give up on such an awesome idea.

Operations
Our
initial class schedule of current popular devices is a selection from
the 2014 Global Mobile Awards. Future classes will include past popular
devices in addition to current and new devices as they enter the market.
Classes will also be provided in different languages and coupons made available
reducing the already low class price. Classes are held in a Webinar conference
manner which means they are interactive. So at any time during the presentation
a class member may ask questions. These interactive classes can help anyone
gain working knowledge and understanding of their device, no matter what their
reading level.  . When you book a class,
$14.95 USD, you automatically become a website member.

About
me
I
have worked in Software Development and Business Analysis for over 15 years,
with expertise in programming and project management. The purchase of a
smartphone for my daughter and her/our frustrations learning to use it began
this project. Social City Net is
centered on the website, it provides class description, scheduling, booking and
client information. Taking the website through concept, design and finally
construction has been quite a journey.
I
believe Social City Net is an awesome concept and this campaign is a funding
effort, but it also conveys a serious message. 
The Non-Tech-Savvy face a serious dilemma every day for no reason and
without a voice to raise an alarm.  You
might think this trivial today but tomorrow hopefully you will see it is not.
If
you feel it’s a great idea but aren't able to contribute financially, no
problem. There are so many other ways to help out. We appreciate those who
tell us they talk about Social City Net with people they meet. It helps us
when people join in on our social media pages to ""like"", comment,
share, tweet, and pin. We have to give a special shout out to our wonderful
Facebook fans who have formed a sort of grass roots movement to help spread the
word. Thank you to each and every one of you!  LinkedIn
If
you are not supporting this campaign because you are Tech-Savvy and feel this message
trivial, think about who the Non-Tech-Savvy really are!  If you still can’t donate but realize what a
great idea this is, please tell others about it and share the Indiegogo tools!",8.0,0,"4 Campaigns

With your mobile you can arm or disarm the system without using the mobile application, just passing the mobile in front of the NFC transmitter</p><p><b>Door Lock</b> - Know who's coming and going in your home. Assign entry codes to help you control traffic and improve your sense of security when you're not there without having to copy a key.  You can remotely unlock doors from other areas of your property using a remote, smartphone or tablet.</p><p><b>Indoor/ Outdoor Wireless IP Camera</b> - Allows you to watch over your home or business in real-time, from anywhere in the world from your smartphone or tablet. In the event of an emergency alarm derived from sensors, the camera starts recording to capture pre and post alarm, then delivers directly to you.</p><p><b>PIR Quad Motion Sensor</b> - Detects motion by measuring changes in the infrared (heat) levels emitted by surrounding objects. Compared to Smarthings, Canary or Scout, the ALYT quad motion detector is far more powerful. ALYT use a 4 ray IR sensor that covers over 150° wide and 15m distance. We take security serious.</p><p><b>Volumetric Outdoor Sensor </b>- Volumetric Alarm protects your home, business, vehicle, boat or RV and instantly sounds an alarm at the first sign of an intruder. Unlike other sensors that notify once the intruder breaches, ALYT detects changes in air pressure and can sound an alarm in advance of an intruder entering.</p><p><br/></p><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Smart Home Add-Ons</span></h3><p><b>Lamp Holder Actuator</b> - This allows you to switch a light bulb on and off according to the energy-saving home automation system settings.</p><p><b>Temperature Sensor</b> – Ideal for monitoring/ energy optimizing temperatures in pools, spas, aquariums, cellars, attics and more.</p><p><b>Smoke CO2 Detector</b> - Monitor the state of your home and be alerted to smoke, fire and carbon monoxide.

Does it come with the board only? Or also the box/cover?</b></p><p>The Guru edition comes complete like the product in mass production with all the sensors in the kit and accessories. But there is a big difference: ALYT GURU is a onetime special edition with a PCB branded ALYT GURU and in a translucent case!</p><p><b>Is there any difference in the hardware between the GURU edition and the final edition? Does the final edition include any additional features?</b></p><p>No, there will be no differences between the GURU edition and the final one. However, the GURU Limited Edition will offer something extra: an engraving stating ""ALYT GURU"", to recognize and reward our early supporters.</p><p><b>What are the shipping costs?</b></p><p>Shipping in the US will be $15 and $30 everywhere else. Shipment does not include extra fees from customs, or additional costs associated with your country. As we investigate the specifics of product availability in each country, we will refund your order if ALYT is not compatible with your country's requirements  </p><p><b>Will ALYT work with other security products on the market?</b></p><p>Yes, the communication channels use standard and widespread protocols: </p><p>- ZWave: all the certified devices sold in the market will be integrated in ALYT</p><p>- ZigBee and Bluetooth: not only the standard stacks and protocols can be used, but also proprietary if needed by the user.</p><p>Third-party system can interact with ALYT using standard web services communication.</p><p><b>How long do the batteries last?</b></p><p>ALYT will only need to rely on the battery in the event of a power outage. Our goal is to operate in battery mode as long as possible, but this is definitely related to user actions. For example, if the user is using the mobile phone and requires a lot of live or recorded video streams then the battery life will be unfortunately be shorter. However, the system in normal operation mode can work for several days.</p><p><b>What if I lose my smartphone?</b></p><p>If you lose your phone, you can still arm and disarm your system with the buttons on the hub itself or using RFID remote control. The lost phone can be disabled via web interface.</p><p><b>Does ALYT have to be connected to the internet to work?</b></p><p>No, it is possible to use the system in local WiFi mode which does not require an internet connection.</p><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Technical Questions</span></h3><p></p><p></p><p><b>ALYT is safe? What happens if my power or internet goes out?</b></p><p>Yes, data communications uses 128-bit AES encryption. The ALYT system integrates a back-up battery in order to keep your system running when the power goes out. In these scenarios, two external data communication channels are used:  3G cellular and a WiFi, then the internet connectivity is assured via WiFi, through the home router, or via cellular network. If internet is not available, it is always possible to directly call the user (voice call) or send an SMS text message using the GSM network. Plus, if WiFi local mode is available, then without internet (cellular or WiFi) the system can always be activated or deactivated.</p><p><b>What phones work with ALYT?</b></p><p>iOS and Android smartphones, using our mobile app, can control the system. Future development will include control via SMS, direct call voice recognition, DTMF signaling and responsive design web pages, and also GSM mobile phone,</p><p><b>Does ALYT work with 230V 50 Hz?</b></p><p>Of course, ALYT works perfectly also with 230V 50Hz.</p><p><b>Is it possible to use ALYT with European Z-Wave (868.42 MHz) and Zigbee (868 MHz) devices?</b></p><p>The EU version work on the European frequency, Z-Wave (868.42 MHz) and Zigbee (868 MHz).</p><p><b>Will the ALYT GURU limited edition ship with EU frequencies in June 2014 with all required CE certifications ?</b></p><p>Absolutely, yes. We have years of experience dealing with certifications, including EN50131, IMQ and TUV. We are already testing them inside our labs. </p><p>We will get all the necessary certifications after the preproduction.</p><p><b>Is 512mb enough RAM to power Alyt as expansions are added?</b></p><p>Yes, 512Mb is plenty to manage all of the expansions! This is because the user interface is not onboard ALYT, so all the resources are dedicated to the ALYT core process.</p><p><b>Since ALYT is a wireless system, what is the reliable distance for a consistent signal?</b></p><p>1) Security Protocol: up to 2000Ft (600m) in open field, up to 350Ft (100m) indoors. If you have reinforced concrete the radio signal can pass through three to four inches of reinforced concrete. </p><p>2)Z-Wave and Zigbee: these are mash protocols, so each device can exchange the signal to the next.</p><p>3)Bluetooth 4.0: up to 200Ft.</p><p><b>Since Alyt works with cellular service, does it require a SIM card? If so, what type?</b></p><p>ALYT has built-in 3.5G cellular connectivity, so YES you will need a SIM card to use it! However, we will provide (in some regions) a SIM card, but you can also choose to use your own favorite SIM card, too! ALYT uses the GSM Standard and is able to operate worldwide. You can use a standard SIM card from any carrier (no Verizon or any CDMA only carriers at the moment).</p><p><b>For your wireless security protocol that operates over 868MHz, are you able to change this frequency to operate between 915MHz to 928MHz?</b></p><p>YES we can use different frequencies for different countries (for example in China we will use 433Mhz). We use Texas Instrument chips to manage our protocol, in particular the model series CC11XX (cc1101 cc1110 cc1121). Everything can be set to communicate on different frequencies including 433Mhz, 868Mhz, 908Mhz, 915Mhz 928Mhz. We just need to use a different antenna and change some passive components.</p><p></p><br/><p></p><p>

It can save 30%.Socket Switching Actuator - Reduces the energy waste from phantom loads that run through appliances while they are turned off. This can save 11%.Z-Wave Clamp Power Meter - Enables you to measure the power consumption of your home or office. It can report actual consumption (in W) and the accumulated power used (in kWh), enabling you to understand when and how you use electricity, which allows you to make decisions on how you can reduce your energy consumption and energy bills.We didn't want ALYT to be ""just another app.""Mobile AppALYT will allow you to control and monitor your world in real-time with a single dedicated APP for smartphones and tablets, from anywhere in the world. ALYT App will learn from the user’s habits. It can be customized on the basis of little and specific needs in order to make each aspect of everyday life easier. It is an open app which allows anybody to develop new additional features, sharing them with all the ALYT community of users.Android Operating SystemALYT is the first system of its kind that runs internally on the Android platform with completely open software.ALYT is not just a hub since ANDROID runs inside ALY, powering its engine. So, much like any ANDROID smartphone or tablet, ALYT is immediately ready for expansion from third party apps and devices.Open SourceThanks to the ALYT open architecture, the features are likely to be expanded upon by a global ecosystem of ALYT ""gurus"" for the benefit of the world user community.
“We believe in an open, boundless world, and that’s why our product is the first Smart Home Manager powered by Android,” Luca Gaetano Capula, founder and CEO of Link Your Things.
“Since Android is open and runs inside the unit, thousands of developers will be able to help us improve consumers’ lives at home. We decided to make even our hardware design open so that developers and manufacturers can innovate using ALYT as a solid base.”
ALYT APP StoreThe home security and smart home marketplace is one of the fastest growing markets and developers will be readily able to take advantage of this new, smart way of living. Kind of just like the app store…Developers can create and sell apps that can be purchased and downloaded much the same way you do from the Google Play Store or Apple Store today.
ALYT Integration With Others
There are several ways to integrate ALYT with other apps, devices and systems. The user, maker or developer can extend ALYT functionalities using the Java Classloader technology. This way, ALYT will know how to interact with new devices of any type. Other systems can interact with ALYT using standard http call to get or set the status of the devices or trigger some actions. Finally users can installer Android App directly on ALYT using the well-known tool (Eclipse). If you want, you can flash ALYT and do whatever you want!CREATE SCENES WITH ALYTA scene is a sequence of actions defined by your preferences. We’ll paint a picture of how your life could look like using scenes.
Do you leave the house every day around 8:30 AM? ALYT can turn the thermostat down to save up energy; it can also start warming up the house by turning up the temperature for when you come back, let’s say 6:30 PM? Done. 
The sprinklers work harder during summer months. One of your rules can be that during winter, the sprinklers only turn on every other day. 
What if you’re working late and you’re worried about an empty house? You can set the lights to turn on, from wherever you are, at a certain time in random patterns so it looks like someone is home.
WAKE UP! The lights in your bedroom can gradually turn on, while the TV, with a slowly increasing volume goes to your favorite music channel, and your morning coffee is ready for you to enjoy. “Going to bed”, “Arriving home”, “Vacation” can be the type of customized scenes that you can setup to make your daily life more comfortable and enjoyable.SETUP IS EASY!ALYT is riducoulsely easy to set up! It takes 3 steps...

The Brains Behind ALYTThe team behind ALYT is founded on the principle of security and compose some of the top experts in the secuirty industry.ALYT integrates the highest levels of professional security, the latest functionality in home automation and the endless opportunity for the Internet Of Things. We have built a team of high skilled engineers from all around the world, selected the best -performing components and chose the most reliable suppliers.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSGeneral QuestionsHow difficult is it to install ALYT?It is very easy and intuitive, anyone can learn to use it in a matter of minutes, just plug ALYT in and follow a few setup steps to get up and running.Will ALYT be available worldwide?Yes, we are going to sell products worldwide!What’s the difference of the GURU offer? Does it come with the board only? Or also the box/cover?The Guru edition comes complete like the product in mass production with all the sensors in the kit and accessories. But there is a big difference: ALYT GURU is a onetime special edition with a PCB branded ALYT GURU and in a translucent case!Is there any difference in the hardware between the GURU edition and the final edition? Does the final edition include any additional features?No, there will be no differences between the GURU edition and the final one. However, the GURU Limited Edition will offer something extra: an engraving stating ""ALYT GURU"", to recognize and reward our early supporters.What are the shipping costs?Shipping in the US will be $15 and $30 everywhere else. Shipment does not include extra fees from customs, or additional costs associated with your country. As we investigate the specifics of product availability in each country, we will refund your order if ALYT is not compatible with your country's requirements  Will ALYT work with other security products on the market?Yes, the communication channels use standard and widespread protocols: - ZWave: all the certified devices sold in the market will be integrated in ALYT- ZigBee and Bluetooth: not only the standard stacks and protocols can be used, but also proprietary if needed by the user.Third-party system can interact with ALYT using standard web services communication.How long do the batteries last?ALYT will only need to rely on the battery in the event of a power outage. Our goal is to operate in battery mode as long as possible, but this is definitely related to user actions. For example, if the user is using the mobile phone and requires a lot of live or recorded video streams then the battery life will be unfortunately be shorter. However, the system in normal operation mode can work for several days.What if I lose my smartphone?If you lose your phone, you can still arm and disarm your system with the buttons on the hub itself or using RFID remote control. The lost phone can be disabled via web interface.Does ALYT have to be connected to the internet to work?No, it is possible to use the system in local WiFi mode which does not require an internet connection.Technical QuestionsALYT is safe? What happens if my power or internet goes out?Yes, data communications uses 128-bit AES encryption. The ALYT system integrates a back-up battery in order to keep your system running when the power goes out. In these scenarios, two external data communication channels are used:  3G cellular and a WiFi, then the internet connectivity is assured via WiFi, through the home router, or via cellular network. If internet is not available, it is always possible to directly call the user (voice call) or send an SMS text message using the GSM network. Plus, if WiFi local mode is available, then without internet (cellular or WiFi) the system can always be activated or deactivated.What phones work with ALYT?iOS and Android smartphones, using our mobile app, can control the system. Future development will include control via SMS, direct call voice recognition, DTMF signaling and responsive design web pages, and also GSM mobile phone,Does ALYT work with 230V 50 Hz?Of course, ALYT works perfectly also with 230V 50Hz.Is it possible to use ALYT with European Z-Wave (868.42 MHz) and Zigbee (868 MHz) devices?The EU version work on the European frequency, Z-Wave (868.42 MHz) and Zigbee (868 MHz).Will the ALYT GURU limited edition ship with EU frequencies in June 2014 with all required CE certifications ?Absolutely, yes. We have years of experience dealing with certifications, including EN50131, IMQ and TUV. We are already testing them inside our labs. We will get all the necessary certifications after the preproduction.Is 512mb enough RAM to power Alyt as expansions are added?Yes, 512Mb is plenty to manage all of the expansions! This is because the user interface is not onboard ALYT, so all the resources are dedicated to the ALYT core process.Since ALYT is a wireless system, what is the reliable distance for a consistent signal?1) Security Protocol: up to 2000Ft (600m) in open field, up to 350Ft (100m) indoors. If you have reinforced concrete the radio signal can pass through three to four inches of reinforced concrete. 2)Z-Wave and Zigbee: these are mash protocols, so each device can exchange the signal to the next.3)Bluetooth 4.0: up to 200Ft.Since Alyt works with cellular service, does it require a SIM card? If so, what type?ALYT has built-in 3.5G cellular connectivity, so YES you will need a SIM card to use it! However, we will provide (in some regions) a SIM card, but you can also choose to use your own favorite SIM card, too! ALYT uses the GSM Standard and is able to operate worldwide. You can use a standard SIM card from any carrier (no Verizon or any CDMA only carriers at the moment).For your wireless security protocol that operates over 868MHz, are you able to change this frequency to operate between 915MHz to 928MHz?YES we can use different frequencies for different countries (for example in China we will use 433Mhz). We use Texas Instrument chips to manage our protocol, in particular the model series CC11XX (cc1101 cc1110 cc1121). Everything can be set to communicate on different frequencies including 433Mhz, 868Mhz, 908Mhz, 915Mhz 928Mhz. We just need to use a different antenna and change some passive components.

<i style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">THE BACKGROUND</i><br/>
</h3><h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Mindset - The vision</span></h3><p>We
are living in a fascinating moment in the global history of fashion.
The industry has for the last twenty years tirelessly exploited its
human and material resources. Nothing is more scandalous in 2014 than
the existence of these enormous wastelands, regions of the world where
history, materials, urban legends and the images produced are as yet
undiscovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two
expressions encapsulate this moment : “ new wind ” and “ fresh blood ”. The
world is on the lookout for new stories, new aesthetics, new rhythms,
and it has never been more urgent than it is today to follow through
on our creative impulses, to regenerate models and to shed light on the
diversity of knowledge. The world is waiting for us, we’re at it’s
front door…</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each
of the factors that can contribute to the construction of viable
fashion projects is controllable and in our hands. The passion of
certain people, the talent of others, the digitalisation of interactions and
consummation, this is how the future of Senegal’s young creators is
evolving. SRK subscribes to this perspective, at a key moment for the
brand, one of big changes and new orientations. The label has been
able to create a refined offering, relevant on both a local and
international level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SRK
has understood its market and possesses a knowledge of the necessary
tools for its development and fulfilment, which are expected to be
major in 2014 and 2015. This is based upon the construction of an
enterprise project that would be the leader in terms of textile
confection and style in Senegal. The element which will complete the
mould relies upon your participation in the development of the
project, here and now.</p><p></p><h3>The creative director - Selly Raby Kane</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/475472/files/20140401052920-524736_10152388330460206_1785431891_n.jpg?1396355360"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Credit photo &amp; copyright : Omar Viktor Diop</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>

a land of conformity, she wears fluoro hair extensions as necklaces
and mixes pagne with denim, jersey or plastic. Always chic, always
glam, always cool, but never taking herself too seriously, only she
knows how to flirt with the “ bizarre ” with so much class. Icon
of the Dakar underground and Senegalese fashion, an emblematic figure
of the new artistic scene with an unrestrained creativity and a style
that is effervescent and offbeat, the stylist Selly Raby Kane invites
you to into the universe of her new collection, in the theme of Alien
Cartoon. Prepare for lift-off, direction Dakar’s train station,
mid-May 2014…</p>
<p>
</p><p>A
graduate in business administration in France with a masters in
product management in textile industries and styling (MOD’SPE
Paris), Selly Raby Kane created the label SRK in 2008. Since then
this young creative entrepreneur has enjoyed significant success for
her unconventional universe which disrupts trends and habits; for
example her most recent fashion show “ Be Street ” where with her
collective Les Petites Pierres she created an enormous living urban
décor, “ The Street is in Style ”, the first street fashion show
in Senegal (Gueule Tapée Canal, Médina) or the production of “
Inner Cruise ”, a dreamlike voyage into her interior universe…</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even
at the time of its first appearance on the Senegalese artistic
scene, the name SRK was rapidly recognised within the fashion
industry as one to watch, from Paris to Algiers, from New York to
Cape Town, and Selly Raby Kane is often invited beyond Senegal, where the label has
kept its base. Following on from the first phase of development
centred on an events and <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">image
strategy, the SRK project is entering into its second phase, the
focus being an enterprise project which plans in 2014 and 2015 to
mount an industrial production line, and aims for a commercialisation
and diffusion of the brand’s projects on a large scale.</span></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3><i><br/></i></h3><h3><i>THE PROJECT</i></h3><h3>An african invaded city - Alien Cartoon</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/475470/files/20140401052418-8_Moodboard_Dakreative.jpg?1396355058"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Credit photo &amp; copyright : Guillaume Bassinet</i></p><p></p><p>

in Mali that have put the legendary Dakar-Bamako line on hold have
left the station vulnerable to neglect and disuse. What was once a
bustling centre for commerce and travel is now falling into ruin,
twice a day welcoming Dakar’s suburban commuter train, a tiny
example of what the station could become if rehabilitated.</p><p>This
building is unique within the architectural landscape of the city, in
terms of size and style, and provides the perfect opportunity to
create a space that will serve both its original function of train
station, and interact with the passage and movement of people through
its halls through a dynamic of exhibitions and cultural events. Selly
Raby Kane and Les Petites Pierres have initiated a campaign to ensure
that the “ Old Lady ” will be brought back to life and re-instated
as an essential part of Dakar’s heritage ; past, present and future.
“Alien Cartoon” is one of several events planned for the station
in 2014, as a way of demonstrating the incredible prospects that it
offers to Dakar’s population.

</div></div>","THE BACKGROUND
Mindset - The visionWe
are living in a fascinating moment in the global history of fashion.
The industry has for the last twenty years tirelessly exploited its
human and material resources. Nothing is more scandalous in 2014 than
the existence of these enormous wastelands, regions of the world where
history, materials, urban legends and the images produced are as yet
undiscovered.

Two
expressions encapsulate this moment : “ new wind ” and “ fresh blood ”. The
world is on the lookout for new stories, new aesthetics, new rhythms,
and it has never been more urgent than it is today to follow through
on our creative impulses, to regenerate models and to shed light on the
diversity of knowledge. The world is waiting for us, we’re at it’s
front door…

Each
of the factors that can contribute to the construction of viable
fashion projects is controllable and in our hands. The passion of
certain people, the talent of others, the digitalisation of interactions and
consummation, this is how the future of Senegal’s young creators is
evolving. SRK subscribes to this perspective, at a key moment for the
brand, one of big changes and new orientations. The label has been
able to create a refined offering, relevant on both a local and
international level.

SRK
has understood its market and possesses a knowledge of the necessary
tools for its development and fulfilment, which are expected to be
major in 2014 and 2015. This is based upon the construction of an
enterprise project that would be the leader in terms of textile
confection and style in Senegal. The element which will complete the
mould relies upon your participation in the development of the
project, here and now.The creative director - Selly Raby KaneCredit photo & copyright : Omar Viktor Diop
In
a land of conformity, she wears fluoro hair extensions as necklaces
and mixes pagne with denim, jersey or plastic. Always chic, always
glam, always cool, but never taking herself too seriously, only she
knows how to flirt with the “ bizarre ” with so much class. Icon
of the Dakar underground and Senegalese fashion, an emblematic figure
of the new artistic scene with an unrestrained creativity and a style
that is effervescent and offbeat, the stylist Selly Raby Kane invites
you to into the universe of her new collection, in the theme of Alien
Cartoon. Prepare for lift-off, direction Dakar’s train station,
mid-May 2014…

A
graduate in business administration in France with a masters in
product management in textile industries and styling (MOD’SPE
Paris), Selly Raby Kane created the label SRK in 2008. Since then
this young creative entrepreneur has enjoyed significant success for
her unconventional universe which disrupts trends and habits; for
example her most recent fashion show “ Be Street ” where with her
collective Les Petites Pierres she created an enormous living urban
décor, “ The Street is in Style ”, the first street fashion show
in Senegal (Gueule Tapée Canal, Médina) or the production of “
Inner Cruise ”, a dreamlike voyage into her interior universe…

Even
at the time of its first appearance on the Senegalese artistic
scene, the name SRK was rapidly recognised within the fashion
industry as one to watch, from Paris to Algiers, from New York to
Cape Town, and Selly Raby Kane is often invited beyond Senegal, where the label has
kept its base. Following on from the first phase of development
centred on an events and image
strategy, the SRK project is entering into its second phase, the
focus being an enterprise project which plans in 2014 and 2015 to
mount an industrial production line, and aims for a commercialisation
and diffusion of the brand’s projects on a large scale.THE PROJECTAn african invaded city - Alien CartoonCredit photo & copyright : Guillaume Bassinet
Dakar
train station as never seen before, transformed into an Alien space
base. This is the designer's outlandish project for her annual
fashion show. The entirety of the installation will stay in place
for two weeks, giving the public the opportunity to throw themselves
into the fantastical universe of Alien Cartoon.

An
interactive fashion show and art performance concept that will turn
the station’s main building into an Alien village, offering a
sensory, visual and auditive experience to the public. Artists from
the Les Petites Pierres collective will take part
in this project, as well as international artists on creative
residencies.

The
use of digital and innovative technologies will be prioritised,
particularly during the first part of the opening event, where a
large-scale labyrinth installation will hold the public in the
forecourt of the station before the doors open."" If
I had to define Alien Cartoon it would be a reflexion on a futuristic
invaded African city, where naive and fantastic creatures
evolve among human beings.What would that city look like ? What would its inhabitants wear ? What
would gravity become ? How would we go from one place to another ? Air
? Seas ? Under-Underground ? Teleportation ? ""Selly Raby Kane speaking about Alien Cartoon

THE
ALIEN CARTOON LABYRINTH / EXPERIMENTAL ZONE

The labyrinth is an incredible experience and installation on the Dakar train station's including forecourt with creative screenings &
projections, a digital technology installation, living creatures…Including:The House of the Holy AlienEnter
into the Alien Cartoon universe : creatures in movement, naïve,
fantastical and futurist, costumes integrating touch-screen tablets,
interactive video content, LED lights, electricity, water, take a look at the installation concept below…The BrainCerebral alien activity in the form of draws featuring contents which bring thoughts and urges to life: an interactive experience based on the discovery of different objects and textures…OCTOPUS INSTALLATIONCreation
of a giant octopus (half-octopus/half-tree) whose tentacles and
roots unwind throughout the space, accompanied by a specific sonar
universe. An
artistic collaboration between Doulcy (senegalese fashion designer) and Doctor L (french video and sound composer).

THE INNER CRUISE INSTALLATIONA reconstruction and reinterpretation of the theme developed in the film produced by Tom Escarmelle on the universe of Selly Raby Kane. Projections of content from the film, an oneiric bathtub décor, branches and foliage, baobabs and vegetation...

THE ALIEN PHOTOBOOTHVisitors

THE ALIEN BARSMonochrome
drinks, weird cocktails, a “ what would these aliens drink ?
” beverage…THE RUNWAY - ALIEN CARTOON FASION SHOWThe Alien cartoon Collection will show the influence that fantastic and futuristic creatures has had on the human clothing aesthetic. To put the highlight on the garments, a minimal runway will be set up with an animated and organic background.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar, and seemingly secure, to embrace the new. But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power.Alan Cohen---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A collective art performance
In
the spirit of exchange and travel that is at the heart of Alien
Cartoon, multi-disciplinary artists from both Senegal and abroad will
be invited to create site-specific installations in response to the
theme.Music and video makers

A collaboration between Selly and Paul is scheduled during his stay.  YOUR SUPPORTSave the old lady ! - Dakar's old train station
The
decision to host the show at the Dakar train station is most
certainly not a random one. The Old Lady (Dakar train station) will be celebrating her
100th
birthday this year, and there’s no way Selly could let such an
important date go by without throwing a great big shindig. A general
wane in rail travel cross the African continent, combined with events
in Mali that have put the legendary Dakar-Bamako line on hold have
left the station vulnerable to neglect and disuse. What was once a
bustling centre for commerce and travel is now falling into ruin,
twice a day welcoming Dakar’s suburban commuter train, a tiny
example of what the station could become if rehabilitated.This
building is unique within the architectural landscape of the city, in
terms of size and style, and provides the perfect opportunity to
create a space that will serve both its original function of train
station, and interact with the passage and movement of people through
its halls through a dynamic of exhibitions and cultural events. Selly
Raby Kane and Les Petites Pierres have initiated a campaign to ensure
that the “ Old Lady ” will be brought back to life and re-instated
as an essential part of Dakar’s heritage ; past, present and future.
“Alien Cartoon” is one of several events planned for the station

Welcome Threading Epilation!Do you know that Depilation and Epilation have two different meanings? Depilation removes hair at just the surface, while epilation removes the entire hair and lasts longer than depilation.Here you can find the smartest and chicest tool for epilation: COLIBRY removes body hair follicles, delaying the re-growth until follicles bulbs are reformed.COLIBRY uses the ancient hair removal technique of threading and makes it smarter. Conventional Hair Removal Technique Pain PointsLet's be honest: how much do you struggle to remove body hair? How much do you spend on body care? No matter the answer. What we know is that:Razors and Chemicals are as fast as dangerous, and hair grow faster and stronger. This method cannot be included in the hashtag #bodycare.Waxing and Electric Epilators are as efficient as painful, not even yet to consider they both waste materials and energy; they also affect aggressively on the skin, thereby causing irritation.Electroepilators and Laser are even more dangerous and infinitely more expensive. Above all, ""burning"" the skin is quite far from the idea of natural beauty.That's why COLIBRY is committed to threading epilation, because the ancient tradition is still the best option that we have to remove body hair efficiently. In modern times, all efforts to make an efficient tool for threading are not enough. We've tried them all, but they didn't work as well as we expected.COLIBRY Features COLIBRY is a whole new concept: it's delicate on the skin without irritation, actually stimulating micro-circulation under skin tissue; it epilates with long duration and weakens the hair; it's ecological because it doesn't need battery and doesn't produce waste; it's precise because you can see clearly where you are epilating; and it's economic because you only need COLIBRY, and voilà - it's done.How COLIBRY WorksThis technique of hair removal is possible thanks to a durable thread which is rolled up on itself forming a small spiral: rendering hair uprooting possible because hair remains trapped following the hand movement.Colibry is designed to save time and allows you to easily move around removing even the shortest hair on the skin.COLIBRY is very simple, and very efficientThe passage is rapid. You won't believe how pleasant it is.Who Tried It First?""You designed it, so you try it!"" - said everyone ever.And so I let the designers test COLIBRY on themselves first, turns out, it worked wonderfully even on strong hair, and even for men. ""I used to wax my legs when I was a football player. I remember so much pain. But Colibry is different: just a constant tickle on the skin. And then smoothness..""""..obviously I epilated my entire body after this shot"" What You Can Do With COLIBRYCOLIBRY is so manageable that you can use it on different occasions, starting from a self-application on the legs.The hair on the arms won't be a problem anymore.

Lastly, most dress shirts are uncomfortable. Driven by LEZÉ the Label's core principle for comfort, the world's first recycled coffee dress shirts was created. Using 100% sustainable and vegan materials, we've crated the best fitted dress shirt brought by extensive research on different body types. 

 
IF YOU'RE DRINKING COFFEE, WHY NOT WEAR IT?  Every year, 2.25 billion cups of coffee is enjoyed by the world annually. Instead of ending the cycle of utility, we are taking the benefits from the roasted coffee grounds into our shirts. When coffee beans are roasted, they experience expansion, which activates its natural moisture-wicking & odor-fighting properties.  The oil from used ground coffee is extracted at a micro-level to create this patented S Cafe® technology. Next, it is infused during the production of our yarn to maintain its coffee benefits, without its original colors or scent.   Our vegan-friendly recycled coffee yarn and bamboo rayon are knitted into a single jersey using a single needle weft machine. The entire process takes place at Blue Sign and Global Recycle Standard certified facilities. We are proud to partner with a women-owned and operated manufacturer based in Taiwan, who proudly compensates employees with 15% higher pay than industry standard.   Our anti-gaping button technology starts with strategically placed buttons over the bust for maximum coverage, supplemented with added fabric width to prevent stretching around the armpit. The buttons are further reinforced by hidden magnets that automatically clasps your shirt closed during sudden movements.  Gone are the days where a simple movement will create permanent creases on your shirt for the rest of the day. Our wrinkle-resistant article ensures this shirt will never see the existence of an iron.      Life is stressful. Face high-intensity situations with the certainty knowing your armpits will be sweat stain-free. Our innovative technology wicks away sweat for 200% faster drying process than cotton. At the same time, our fabric's coffee pores absorb odors that pass through, allowing you to stay fresh for longer.     Experience the versatility of our knit fabric in a 4-way stretch. Its flexible construction adapts to your body's natural movements, so you are comfortable no matter what you're doing.    To complete your hunt for dress shirts, we have three styles with anti-wrinkle, moisture-wicking, and no-gaping technology. Whatever function or event that you're dressing up for, we have a shirt for you. Our Slim Fit dress shirt showcases a minimalist style with a mandarin collar and rounded cuffs. Pleats are strategically placed in the back only to maintain a clean look. The hidden placket further conceals our magnetic no-gape technology to ensure your blouse stays closed at all times.    Our Classic Fit consists of a traditional collar with infusion for the perfect amount of stiffness in its structure. Two buttons adorn the cuffs to allow for flexibility in wrist comfort. Similar to the Slim, pleats line the back so the front is sleek and modern, while the chest is enclosed with our magnetic no-gape technology.     Our Boyfriend Fit sports a relaxed fit, while still maintaining an appealing silhouette. The statement 7"" cuffs add a French twist. A singular pocket dresses the front chest, while the lining adopts a hi-low fashion and a layered slit for ease of tucking in the shirt. Instead of our magnetic no-gape technology, the bust has a precise amount of space to prevent buttons from gaping.                                                           We highly recommend that you measure yourself to find the right size, and avoid referencing off other brands, as sizing can be subjective. Our sizes are True to Fit.    Feeling daunted in the workplace is a feeling that we can all relate to, and entrepreneurs Tanya and Karen were no different. Before starting LEZÉ the Label, the pair leveraged their wardrobe to combat self-doubt - but found that most workwear were neither versatile or comfortable.   With a fond affinity for loungewear, the two became inspired to create functional and fashionable workwear beyond one purpose.

<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Hey Indiegogo!</span></h2>
<p>My name is Justin Sohn and I’m here to launch Sidebar Eyewear.</p>
<p>As a college student, I have always loved and needed sunglasses. One morning, I woke up to my Oakleys chewed up on the floor next to my bed, thanks to my puppy Melo. Immediately I went out and started looking for my next pair. The only options available were cheap $10 knockoffs that don’t protect your eyes or crazy expensive designer brands.</p>
<p>So why are sunglasses so expensive? A few large powerhouses have been running a monopoly and inflating prices since the 1980s. The worlds largest eyewear company, Luxottica, owns almost every brand or store you can think of related to sunglasses such as, Rayban, Oakley, LensCrafters, and Sunglass Hut. They also control all aspects of manufacturing, including design, pricing, and distribution. This results in extremely inflated prices for sunglasses.</p>
<h3>THE IDEA WITH SIDEBAR</h3>
<p>I wanted stylish and durable shades that I could wear anywhere without having to worry about breaking or scratching them. I have always wanted sunglasses for places like the beach, parties, skating, surfing, or just chilling by the pool and enjoying life; and that is what I am now offering to you. I also wanted shades that I wouldn't get bored of. Shades and colors that I could customize to rep sports teams or just switch up the vibe when I wanted to.</p>
<p><em>My goal with Sidebar is to offer the highest quality, polarized, and fully customizable sunglasses at an extremely affordable price. AKA, offer you guys awesome sunglasses that I, myself, am proud to wear. <br/></em></p>
<p><em> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/823358/pictures/full/20130521151250-justinsohn_indiegogo2.jpg?1369174373"" src="""" style=""""/>-Justin<br/></em></p>
<h3><strong>SIDEBAR PREMIER LINE<br/></strong></h3>
<p>The premier line will be Sidebar's first production run ever and that is why we're offering it on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, we have progressed through multiple product design stages, created 3D electronic renditions, built prototypes, sourced samples, refined the design again, completed product durability tests and overall perfected the product.</p>
<p>Sidebar's premier line allows you to be unique every single day. Whether you want to rep your school, your sports team, match any color of clothing possible, or just switch up your style.</p>
<h3><strong><strong>MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION</strong></strong></h3>
<p>We've done our best sourcing and testing of the highest quality materials available<strong><strong>. </strong></strong>As project backers, I believe you have the right to know exactly how your sunglasses are made.</p>
<p><em><strong>SnapBar Hinges</strong></em></p>
<p>The premier line has a SnapBar hinge system that allows you to take apart the sunglasses in a matter of seconds. With SnapBar hinges you can custom build your own shades whenever you want, where ever you want, by interchanging the parts between glasses.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/824264/pictures/original/20130522012705-Snapbar_hinge_indiegogo.jpg?1369211224"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/></span></em><em><strong>Polarized Polycarbonate Lenses</strong></em></p>
<p>The lenses are polarized polycarbonate and have UV filters which block 100% of UVA and UVB ultraviolet rays up to 400 nanometers.</p>
<p>We chose polycarbonate because it is an extremely light weight and strong material. This material is also commonly used to make bullet proof glass, crash helmets, and riot shields. It protects your eyes much better than the often used acrylic or CR-39 lenses.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/824281/pictures/full/20130522014818-lens_materials_indiegogo.jpg?1369212501"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em><strong>The Frames</strong></em></p>
<p>The frames are made of a TR90 memory polymer that is extremely flexible and durable. It can be put under enormous pressure and flex and still return back to its original shape, completely unphased.</p>
<p>You can bend it and twist it in any which way without having to worry about stress marks or cracks. We even ran over the frames with a 4,000 pound truck and it held up like champs!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/824884/pictures/original/20130522094614-1m0q4.gif?1369241158"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p class=""p1"">veer nyc started as a personal need. We had no place to go where clothing was curated with attention to androgynous style for women, and with the understanding that can only come from fitting the description yourself. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Over the past year, veer nyc, has evolved from a need, to a concept, and now onto a business. Both Jenny and Allie have a history in different aspects of the fashion industry. Allie is a photographer and works for a high fashion, multi-brand photo studio. Jenny manages the marketing/advertising division of a large, commercial photo and video production company specializing in fashion and entertainment. Simply put, we look at fashion season after season. Personally, our interests and needs for andro-accessible clothing will help give depth and understanding to the collections we intend to curate.  </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">veer nyc is about to curate our very first collection! To do this we need to purchase a full inventory of apparel and accessories for AW 13 to sell exclusively <strong>online </strong><em>[at first]</em>. We've spent the last few months meeting with designers and brands from all over our country and the world. We've individually selected pieces from men's, women's, and unisex collections that will fit your style, and your body. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Every penny you donate will go towards curating an impeccable first collection that will be on sale later this year. In order to make sure we have everything ready, our selections must be placed and paid for within the next few weeks. So, we are on a serious deadline.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So far, veer nyc has been 100% self-funded. Jenny and Allie believe so much in this business and this need that we are ready and willing to continue to self-fund as much as we possibly can. We are only asking for what we need right now, and every little bit can be used. </p>
<p class=""p1""><em>The more we get, the more you get.</em></p>
<p class=""p2"">We have spent a lot of time trying to determine what we could give back to you for your support! What we've come up with is a series of coveted personal artwork (some which has been published ONLY for our supporters), gift cards (think of it as pre-buying your new wardrobe!), PIZZA PARTIES, styling sessions, and more. The truth is that we could never give back enough though.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Beyond veer nyc</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">veer nyc will help you curate your own wardrobe, but it also is an important step for our culture. Gender presentation is not so black and white. It's easier for many to think the solution is offering ""menswear"" for women, but in reality, we need to get back to just offering clothing; clothing free of men's or women's intentions. </p>
<p class=""p2"">Fashion is one of the most common forms of self-expression. It is an art in itself and every one of us is a walking masterpiece. </p>

<p class=""p1"">For every one of us that begins to break the mold, we will become that much closer to opening the world's eyes to a new understanding of gender and physical expression. Join us in making a difference both personally and culturally.</p>

What we've come up with is a series of coveted personal artwork (some which has been published ONLY for our supporters), gift cards (think of it as pre-buying your new wardrobe!), PIZZA PARTIES, styling sessions, and more. The truth is that we could never give back enough though.
Beyond veer nyc
veer nyc will help you curate your own wardrobe, but it also is an important step for our culture. Gender presentation is not so black and white. It's easier for many to think the solution is offering ""menswear"" for women, but in reality, we need to get back to just offering clothing; clothing free of men's or women's intentions. 
Fashion is one of the most common forms of self-expression. It is an art in itself and every one of us is a walking masterpiece. 
""…it occurred to me looking around at all of your things and your work and going through years of work in my mind, that of all your work, you are still your most beautiful. The most beautiful work of all."" - Patti Smith
For every one of us that begins to break the mold, we will become that much closer to opening the world's eyes to a new understanding of gender and physical expression. Join us in making a difference both personally and culturally.

<p><b>DIESEL MOTORCYCLES FOR THE WORLD!    <br/></b></p>
<p>Support<b> </b><i>MotorEarth's</i>® efforts to provide an ultra-efficient, multi-fuel diesel to the world.</p>
<br/><p><b><u>HOW
IT ALL STARTED</u></b></p>
<p>Years ago, at a biodiesel meeting in
Boulder, CO, Tom Judd and Aaron Scott first met. Tom, engineer, machinist,
mechanic amongst other things, and Aaron, business owner and environmentally
conscious 'gearhead,' decided to build a diesel motorcycle so that they could
benefit from the high efficiency and fuel economy of a diesel engine, and also
be able to run alternative, sustainable, locally made fuels in the bike. This
union spawned the creation of <i>MotorEarth</i>®. The idea was to build a diesel bike
that, up to now, has not been available here in the U.S. <br/></p>
<p>It was obvious early on that manufacturing a
completely new bike was cost prohibitive, so they decided to convert an existing
gas powered bike to diesel and provide these machines to those who have
wanted a simple, rugged, 130+mpg motorcycle able to run on a variety of fuels. </p>
<p></p>
<br/><span><span></span></span>
<p><b><u>THE BIKE</u></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/783776/files/20140812142528-silv358.jpg?1407878728"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>The bike is a multi-fuel, diesel
powered motorcycle converted from a vintage Royal Enfield motorcycle. The
original gas engine is swapped out with a brand new, single cylinder diesel engine,
giving the rider a fuel economy between 130 and 150mpg and designed to run on a
variety of alternative and traditional fuels, including biodiesel, diesel,
SVO/WVO (Straight Vegetable Oil/Waste Vegetable Oil, with proper conversion for utilizing vegetable oils) .

</p>
<p>In an age of ever increasing complexity
and electronic controls in the machines we depend on, this bike is a throw-back
to times when the average person could service and repair their own
transportation with only a few tools and the willingness to get a little dirty.
Its design and mechanics are elegantly simple, rugged, affordable, now fuel
flexible and ultra-efficient. </p>
<p>Fill it up on whatever fuel is
available, ride it down the block, or take it on the open road.  Any way
you choose it, this bike will get you to where you want to go, efficiently,
reliably, and with a stylishly unique character.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><u>130+ MPG!!</u></b> – The efficient 456cc 13HP single
cylinder diesel engines that power these give you fuel-sipping
130+ miles per gallon!!  Ultra simple in function and dead reliable in operation , this power
plant is designed for long life and low maintenance. </p>
<br/><p><b><u>Multi Fuel -</u></b> The unique design of a diesel engine (compression
ignition engine) is that it is able to run on a variety of different fuels,
including environmentally friendly, sustainable, carbon neutral fuels such as
biodiesel and vegetable oil. 

</p>
<br/><p><b><u>Simple, Reliable -</u></b> These motorcycles (Royal Enfields) are known for their
simplicity. They are rugged, field tested, easy to maintain and repair. <br/></p>
<br/><p><b><u>Serviceable -</u></b> When the time comes for maintenance to keep your bike
in tip top shape, they are extremely easy to service and repair. 90% of the
parts that make up these motorcycles are very affordable, stock Royal Enfield
parts which are readily available here in the US and elsewhere around the world.
The motor we have chosen to use in the design of these is one of the most
prolifically produced, single cylinder engines in the world. Parts are also very
affordable and available from a variety of vendors here in the U.S. and around
the world.</p>
<p><b><u><br/></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>WHY WE </u></b><b><u>NEED</u></b><b><u>
YOUR SUPPORT</u></b></p>
</div><div>
<p>
</p>
<p>The goal of this Indiegogo campaign is for you to
have the opportunity to support a product built by the “little guys.” We are two environmentally-conscious motorcycle enthusiasts, trying to bring something to the market that the major manufacturers just have not provided. We are doing our part to bring alternatives to those like us, wishing to cease our dependence on imported, unsustainable and environmentally destructive fossil fuels.<br/></p>
<p>With the funds raised in this campaign, we will purchase the remaining parts needed to finish the eleven (11) uncompleted chassis we currently have here in Denver. The parts we need include: engines, transmission and drive line parts, body parts and paint, rims and tires, and the specialty conversion parts. After these are taken care of, we would ultimately like to purchase more conversion chassis' and the corresponding parts needed to complete the bikes. If there is room for it in the funding, we will put research into moving full production to India and making a completely new, high-efficiency, light, diesel motorcycle for the world market. We also plan to adapt these to a Power Take Off unit (PTO) in order to power generators and water pumps for remote power for those in need, especially in 3rd world countries that do not have power in remote areas. <br/></p>
<p>By providing your support, we will be able to get
these bikes into production quickly, and you will be directly involved in the process of
bringing this diesel motorcycle to life. More than just helping us achieve this goal, you'll lay
claim to being among a select group of supporters to own one of the <i>FIRST</i> commercially
available diesel powered motorcycle in the U.S., and be able to take advantage
of this one time only Indiegogo pricing on these conversions. You have the
chance to be the first to experience the empowerment that comes with running
alternative fuels and the incredible mileage that this bike offers firsthand. And
you'll be able to say that <i>you</i> helped make it a reality!</p>

<br/><p><b><u>RISKS AND CHALLENGES :</u></b></p>
<p>These
bikes are not just an idea, or sitting on a drawing board somewhere. These are a reality. We here at <i>MotorEarth</i>® will make every effort to
stay on schedule and deliver the product to our supporters as soon as possible.
We currently have eleven motorcycles that are in modified-chassis stage…, meaning the
frames have been modified and welded, ready for diesel adaption. Once we secure funding, we will be able to finish the assembly of these. All of these bikes are located here in our shop in Denver, Colorado. We have already test run the prototype
bike for many miles, and are confident in its operation, longevity, and safety.
At this point, we just need the final financial push to be able to complete the
remaining motorcycles and launch our business, which is where you, our supporters, come in. </p>
<p>You will never find a more resourceful,
determined, and dedicated team. We have overcome every obstacle thrown at us so
far (and there have been quite a few in this venture!) and are supremely confident that we will
continue to overcome any challenge that arises to get these bikes to you as
soon as possible. Finally, if there are problems or delays during the
production process, it is our policy to communicate this information and keep our customers in the loop.

</div><br/></div>","DIESEL MOTORCYCLES FOR THE WORLD!    
Support MotorEarth's® efforts to provide an ultra-efficient, multi-fuel diesel to the world.
HOW
IT ALL STARTED
Years ago, at a biodiesel meeting in
Boulder, CO, Tom Judd and Aaron Scott first met. Tom, engineer, machinist,
mechanic amongst other things, and Aaron, business owner and environmentally
conscious 'gearhead,' decided to build a diesel motorcycle so that they could
benefit from the high efficiency and fuel economy of a diesel engine, and also
be able to run alternative, sustainable, locally made fuels in the bike. This
union spawned the creation of MotorEarth®. The idea was to build a diesel bike
that, up to now, has not been available here in the U.S. 
It was obvious early on that manufacturing a
completely new bike was cost prohibitive, so they decided to convert an existing
gas powered bike to diesel and provide these machines to those who have
wanted a simple, rugged, 130+mpg motorcycle able to run on a variety of fuels. 


THE BIKE


The bike is a multi-fuel, diesel
powered motorcycle converted from a vintage Royal Enfield motorcycle. The
original gas engine is swapped out with a brand new, single cylinder diesel engine,
giving the rider a fuel economy between 130 and 150mpg and designed to run on a
variety of alternative and traditional fuels, including biodiesel, diesel,
SVO/WVO (Straight Vegetable Oil/Waste Vegetable Oil, with proper conversion for utilizing vegetable oils) .


In an age of ever increasing complexity
and electronic controls in the machines we depend on, this bike is a throw-back
to times when the average person could service and repair their own
transportation with only a few tools and the willingness to get a little dirty.
Its design and mechanics are elegantly simple, rugged, affordable, now fuel
flexible and ultra-efficient. 
Fill it up on whatever fuel is
available, ride it down the block, or take it on the open road.  Any way
you choose it, this bike will get you to where you want to go, efficiently,
reliably, and with a stylishly unique character.

130+ MPG!! – The efficient 456cc 13HP single
cylinder diesel engines that power these give you fuel-sipping
130+ miles per gallon!!  Ultra simple in function and dead reliable in operation , this power
plant is designed for long life and low maintenance. 
Multi Fuel - The unique design of a diesel engine (compression
ignition engine) is that it is able to run on a variety of different fuels,
including environmentally friendly, sustainable, carbon neutral fuels such as
biodiesel and vegetable oil. 


Simple, Reliable - These motorcycles (Royal Enfields) are known for their
simplicity. They are rugged, field tested, easy to maintain and repair. 
Serviceable - When the time comes for maintenance to keep your bike
in tip top shape, they are extremely easy to service and repair. 90% of the
parts that make up these motorcycles are very affordable, stock Royal Enfield
parts which are readily available here in the US and elsewhere around the world.
The motor we have chosen to use in the design of these is one of the most
prolifically produced, single cylinder engines in the world. Parts are also very
affordable and available from a variety of vendors here in the U.S. and around
the world.

WHY WE NEED
YOUR SUPPORT



The goal of this Indiegogo campaign is for you to
have the opportunity to support a product built by the “little guys.” We are two environmentally-conscious motorcycle enthusiasts, trying to bring something to the market that the major manufacturers just have not provided. We are doing our part to bring alternatives to those like us, wishing to cease our dependence on imported, unsustainable and environmentally destructive fossil fuels.
With the funds raised in this campaign, we will purchase the remaining parts needed to finish the eleven (11) uncompleted chassis we currently have here in Denver. The parts we need include: engines, transmission and drive line parts, body parts and paint, rims and tires, and the specialty conversion parts. After these are taken care of, we would ultimately like to purchase more conversion chassis' and the corresponding parts needed to complete the bikes. If there is room for it in the funding, we will put research into moving full production to India and making a completely new, high-efficiency, light, diesel motorcycle for the world market. We also plan to adapt these to a Power Take Off unit (PTO) in order to power generators and water pumps for remote power for those in need, especially in 3rd world countries that do not have power in remote areas. 
By providing your support, we will be able to get
these bikes into production quickly, and you will be directly involved in the process of
bringing this diesel motorcycle to life. More than just helping us achieve this goal, you'll lay
claim to being among a select group of supporters to own one of the FIRST commercially
available diesel powered motorcycle in the U.S., and be able to take advantage
of this one time only Indiegogo pricing on these conversions. You have the
chance to be the first to experience the empowerment that comes with running
alternative fuels and the incredible mileage that this bike offers firsthand. And
you'll be able to say that you helped make it a reality!

<div><b>So why tobacco?</b></div>
<div>
<div>Tobacco is a highly transgenic plant. There are several plant species that are transgenic, such as lettuce, rice and potatoes. Tobacco grows quickly and grows taller than wide. This makes it perfect for our orbiting garden growing system. Because we are using the entire leafy green plant, we can produce larger quantities faster than other plants. Think tobacco leaf vs. a grain of rice.</div>
<div>The plant can produce vaccines  and other medicines that can be dried and mixed in with food products, liquid to be ingested, injected or vaporized or processed into pill form. Delivery of the medicine will depend on the patient and where the treatment will be best applied.</div>

</div></div>","MNPHARM needs $42,000 to complete our testing and begin production. After meeting this goal, we have additional stretch goals laid out that will help us get this process completed even sooner.Process | Impact | Mission | Facilities | Team | News | FAQMNPHARM will produce proteins for vaccines and antibodies that are personalized and can be produced as much as 30 times faster than current methods. Our methods can be used to fight maladies like cancer and infectious diseases.
The technology MNPHARM intends to utilize is proven to work and, in all likelihood, will be how most vaccines and antibodies are made in the future.Below are a few examples of this technology being used today:


The treatment used to treat the two U.S. citizens that were suffering from Ebola last fall, ZMAPP, was made using tobacco plants at Kentucky BioProcessing, LLC.

Medicago Inc., a Canadian company, recently won a 2012 DARPA Blue Angel Challenge by producing 10,000,000 flu vaccines in just one month using tobacco plants. 
A personalized cancer vaccine clinical trial was recently featured on the Dallas Hope documentary series.

MNPHARM's forward-thinking approach to cancer treatment and desire to make personalized cancer treatments will lead the way to faster and lower cost treatments, making our methods more accessible to everyone. 



For some people, cancer is a condition that comes and goes. It is believed that if managed successfully, certain cancers can be kept from coming back after initial treatment. Many devastating medical conditions from the past are now conditions that are managed with the right medical treatment.

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/102913/files/20130929163434-Family_3_photos.jpg?1380497674"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></h1>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em;"">Hi, we are Fale and Leihana, the parents of five wonderful children, two of which have significant disabilities, Isaiah who has Down Syndrome coupled with a hearing impairment and Ariana who was born blind, is intellectually impaired with severe Autism.  Among their many every day struggles includes the inability of tying shoelaces.  </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h1></h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our oldest son, Viliami, wondered what the solution could be to help them tie their laces, and so with his little brother and sister as his inspiration, he came up with a device that would tighten, neatly and simply lock away the Shoe Laces with a few twists. And so the LACEVAULT was born.</span></p>The <b><i>LACEVAULT</i></b> is not a product just for the disabled, but is a great tool for athletes, the elderly and every day laced up shoe wearers. Simply insert the aglet and turn, that is how simple it is to use.<p></p>
<p>That's not all, <b><i>LACEVAULT</i></b> also goes a step further to become not just a functional device but also the latest in shoe fashion accessories with the release of a great range of colors, and finishes to compliment any laced shoe, for any occasion, from the sports fields and courts to the dance floor or work place.  There is a <b><i>LACEVAULT</i></b> style for everyone and everywhere.<br/></p>

<h2><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>50% of all PROFITS DONATION</b><br/></i></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Through our own experiences of the struggles of raising two disabled children, we have connected and met with many families, and there are thousands of families like ours out there, who have similar struggles and positive desires for their families. However, one underlying need with so many of us, was the lack of opportunity to break away from the endless routines, medical, therapy and educational appointments, and the ongoing constant support of the family member in need. </p>
<p>We all love our children and dedicate our lives to their care, however the chance to take a holiday, to rejuvenate, to reflect and to replenish the body, mind and soul, is almost an impossible dream to reach for many families.  Money is always needed for medical and educational tools and expenses which leaves little or none at all for quality family time, and a break from what can often become tense and stressful situations. Up to 70% of families with special needs individuals end up in divorce. Fathers and even mothers walk out on their family simply because they cannot get a break, a time out or take their family on a holiday.</p>
<p>Because of this great need being so evident among families who support special needs family members, with the sale of each <b><i>LACEVAULT,</i></b> we have committed to pledge 50% of our profit to a foundation that will fund families with time outs, holidays, and family centered recreational activities.  </p>
<p>We have invested time and significant capital to get as far as we have with the designs, and samples, but to go that one step further to commercially launch and fully manufacture and package the <b><i>LACEVAULT</i></b> we need your help.  </p>
<p>We know that our product is simply fantastic, it will help almost everyone and will also look amazing on every laced shoe, but we love the help we could offer families like ours with disabled family members with the sale of each pair. </p>

Hi, we are Fale and Leihana, the parents of five wonderful children, two of which have significant disabilities, Isaiah who has Down Syndrome coupled with a hearing impairment and Ariana who was born blind, is intellectually impaired with severe Autism.  Among their many every day struggles includes the inability of tying shoelaces.  


Our oldest son, Viliami, wondered what the solution could be to help them tie their laces, and so with his little brother and sister as his inspiration, he came up with a device that would tighten, neatly and simply lock away the Shoe Laces with a few twists. And so the LACEVAULT was born.The LACEVAULT is not a product just for the disabled, but is a great tool for athletes, the elderly and every day laced up shoe wearers. Simply insert the aglet and turn, that is how simple it is to use.
That's not all, LACEVAULT also goes a step further to become not just a functional device but also the latest in shoe fashion accessories with the release of a great range of colors, and finishes to compliment any laced shoe, for any occasion, from the sports fields and courts to the dance floor or work place.  There is a LACEVAULT style for everyone and everywhere.
      

So what is Lacevault and how does it work?

Insert the aglet into the Lacevault and turn the dial for a perfect fit and to lock the loose lacing neatly away. To release, simply press the button and pull, that is how simple it is to use.

50% of all PROFITS DONATION

Through our own experiences of the struggles of raising two disabled children, we have connected and met with many families, and there are thousands of families like ours out there, who have similar struggles and positive desires for their families. However, one underlying need with so many of us, was the lack of opportunity to break away from the endless routines, medical, therapy and educational appointments, and the ongoing constant support of the family member in need. 
We all love our children and dedicate our lives to their care, however the chance to take a holiday, to rejuvenate, to reflect and to replenish the body, mind and soul, is almost an impossible dream to reach for many families.  Money is always needed for medical and educational tools and expenses which leaves little or none at all for quality family time, and a break from what can often become tense and stressful situations. Up to 70% of families with special needs individuals end up in divorce. Fathers and even mothers walk out on their family simply because they cannot get a break, a time out or take their family on a holiday.
Because of this great need being so evident among families who support special needs family members, with the sale of each LACEVAULT, we have committed to pledge 50% of our profit to a foundation that will fund families with time outs, holidays, and family centered recreational activities.  
We have invested time and significant capital to get as far as we have with the designs, and samples, but to go that one step further to commercially launch and fully manufacture and package the LACEVAULT we need your help.  
We know that our product is simply fantastic, it will help almost everyone and will also look amazing on every laced shoe, but we love the help we could offer families like ours with disabled family members with the sale of each pair.

<p>That’s why you’ll find a map of Ecuador on the inside of every pair, so you never forget where they came from.</p>

<p>Juntos Project has been in the works for over 2 years.

Typically produced in mass and with low quality, the shoe is a social signifier for the working class. </p>
<p>We set to work redesigning and manufacturing the traditional style at a higher quality and comfort level. The Juntos shoe is incredibly light and features special design features.</p>
<p>With prototypes of our new design ready, we introduced the Juntos Shoe from a food truck during Art Basel. We were invited by Soho Beach House to present our shoe to their members and received amazing feedback and the courage to continue.

But the vision didn’t stop there, once we are established the goal is to:</p><ol style=""margin-left:80px;"">

But the vision didn’t stop there, once we are established the goal is to:

Reinvented. 　 One hundred years ago today, The Great War came to a close. A stunning tribute to a man of that most heroic era and to those who faced the impossible. A perfect match of the latest technology and timeless design, we are proud to release our most refined and advanced timepiece ever. But let's start from the beginning.A LITTLE BIT OF AXIOM HISTORYThe success of our two KICKSTARTER campaigns in 2017 and 2018 was beyond all our expectations: With your support, we have been able to create our own watches. Please now let's see our lattest timepiece. ""EVERYTHING HAS A LIMIT THAT MUST BE SURPASSED""Man has always raised his eyes to the sky, hoping to imitate the bird, free and independent, reigning over the Earth and discovering countries still unknown, with no other constraint than the air that carries it.  At the dawn of the twentieth century, birds of metal, wood, and fabric replaced the wildest dreams. They dominated the battlefields with their beaks, equipped with sophisticated weapons, and were tamed by men whose boundless audacity was matched only by bravery. Masters of the skies, Legendary heroes, this was the time of the Aviateurs.Montre d'Aviateur, Modèle I Born of our passion for the dawn of military aviation, this timepiece is a tribute to the Knights of the Air and their flying mounts. With a diameter of 42 mm and a thickness of 14.70 mm, resistant to depths of up to 200 meters, and fully sculpted 316L stainless steel, the case of the Montre D'Aviateur, Modèle I has been redesigned to incorporate a heart of 31 jewels beating at 28,800 vph with a power reserve of 38 hours: The mythical and extremely accurate Swiss Made Sellita SW 260-1.This is the first AXIOM watch fitted with a movement made in Switzerland. In addition to its outstanding characteristics and its flawless reliability, this movement allows the use of a seconds dial at 6 o'clock, which was a must for us, in order to respect the unique style of watches from the beginning of the Twentieth century. THE SWISS PRECISION FOR A FIELD USEEngraved with the AXIOM logo, the rotor is visible thanks to the sapphire caseback; itself encased in a brushed stainless steel piece precisely engraved (not laser engraved) with the unique serial number of the watch.The case, with a slightly flattened side, is proudly engraved in depth with the name ""Modèle I"" on its left side, reminding the markings on military firearms, while the onion-shaped screw-down crown is a nod to the watches mounted on the cockpits of the fighter planes of the Great War. Finely sandblasted, the case has the exclusive AXIOM ""Gris de Guerre"" (""War Grey"") finish, an anthracite grey PVD process imitating the bluing of the British twin 7,7 mm (.303) Vickers Machine Guns. Firing through the propeller of some of the most the legendary fighters like the SPAD XIII or Nieuport 28, the Vickers was standard on French and British military aircrafts.AN INSTRUMENT ON THE SIDE OF THE WRISTThe dial of the Montre d'Aviateur Modèle I, whose deep matte, non-reflective black texture is revealed in full light, has been conceived and designed as a true instrument panel of the fighter plane. Stylishly contrasting with their dark background, the light-relief figures have the pale yellow colour of ageing Radium, like an Aircraft instrument dial of the Great War having developed a graceful patina over this last century.The result of long research and development work, the seconds hand was created according to the drawing of a classic model of a circa 1918 French on-board instrument hand.With only the diamond of ageing Radium colour, the tip reveals the shiny polish of the metal, this hand, absolutely new in the world of watchmaking, is a real pride for us, and in our eyes is the true signature of the Montre d'Aviateur, Modèle I. The small dial, encircled with polished metal, is placed slightly below the main dial, bringing a structural depth already present in the form of contrasting colours and finishes, such as the glossy polish of the skeleton hands and the logo. In order to make it possible to read the time instantly, whatever the conditions, the numbers 1 to 11, as well as the three hands, have a latest-generation luminous coating which is effective even with minimum exposure to light. Resistant to scratches, we opted for a curved sapphire crystal to bring a final touch of elegance and vintage refinement to this new model. 　QUALITY AS OUR OBJECTIVEAll the parts of our watches are strictly selected. Calf leather was chosen for our straps, both for its natural flexibility to fit perfectly around the wrist, and for its silkiness and softness to the touch. The Montre d'Aviateur Modèle I originally comes with the ""Noyer"" strap, but an ""Acajou"" strap with its buckle is also offered to the project contributors. We decided to keep to the spirit of the first military watches, using a 14 mm wide strap, sliding into a 26 mm wide reinforcement strap. This particular design was once standard, making the watch better suited for field and combat use, giving it a unique identity that we wanted to respect.Nevertheless, the Montre d'Aviateur, Modèle I can obviously be worn with the 14mm strap alone!Finally, each watch is delivered in a strong box of excellent quality  cardboard covered with kraft paper, reproducing the codes and same manufacturing techniques as the packaging of the early 1900s. 　 VETERAN LEATHER TRAVEL ROLLThe Montre D'Aviateur, Modèle I, can also be delivered with a very high quality travel roll in addition to the standard cardboard box. Made entirely of selected leather, our Veteran roll has features a beautiful patina, just like a WWI Aviator jacket!There are only 5 pieces are available, don't miss your chance!A WATCH OF TODAY FOR EVERY DAYThe Montre D'Aviateur, Modèle I. Unique. Perfect for any day, any occasion. Built to last. Through masterful craftsmanship, it demonstrates the toughness of a military designed watch, with the classic beauty of the most elegant Era. AXIOM NEEDS YOU! Launched in 2017, AXIOM needs your support to grow.Believing in us will secure our brand and production, and trust us, we have many other very exciting and totally innovative watchmaking projects in mind!The success of our previous KICKSTARTER campaigns and sales has allowed us to fund all the needed components: cases, dials, hands, etc., of the Montre d'Aviateur, Modèle I.This INDIEGOGO campaign will help us funding the NEXT 2019 watch! A prototype will be manufactured early 2019, and a full production is planned for May or June 2019. We really need your support!Our dream to offer you this timepiece with ageless style, a vibrant tribute to men with only courage as their principle, is now in your hands!Thank you for your support. 　Sincerely,Jonathan & Priscillia. 　  TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS  　 CASE: Montre D'Aviateur, Modèle I DIAMETER: 42 mm THICKNESS OF THE CASE: 14.70 mm  MATERIAL: 316L stainless steel FINISH: Exclusive ""Gris de Guerre"" (""War Grey"") PVD processGLASS: Curved sapphire crystal                                                   SEALING: Waterproof up to 200 meters and screw-down crownMOVEMENT: Swiss Made Sellita SW 260-1 engraved self-winding, 28,800 A/h (4 Hz), 31 jewels  FUNCTIONS: Hours and minutes in the centre.

<blockquote><i>Synergos Wallet Makes Your Life Simpler</i></blockquote>
<h1><i>OUR STORY</i></h1>
<p>We're fans and users of minimal wallets. Their very nature disciplines you to streamline a small part of your everyday life - to bring only what you truly need for the 10-12 hours per day you're carrying a wallet - not the junk that somehow accumulates over time in a traditional wallet or purse.</p>
<p><em>(Did you notice in the video the traditional wallet in the back pocket how about the Synergos? Can you find the Synergos?)</em></p>
<p>The choice between an uncomfortable traditional wallet in your back pocket - (<i>which has the potential of damaging your sciatic nerve over time)</i> or a front pocket Minimal Wallet, is for us, a no brainer. We're fans of the Minimal aesthetic.</p>
<p><img alt=""SYNERGOS WALLET vs A TRADITIONAL WALLET"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/789/918/eff71e2b9bd23ead7ebdf6e1d433e7bf_large.JPG?1375217432"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">SYNERGOS WALLET vs A TRADITIONAL WALLET</strong><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p> Synergos Wallet started about seven months ago after a series of events pointed us in its direction. The first was going to see a potential new client <em> (a 1200 mile trip</em>). Just before the presentation, our team stopped at a FedEx/Kinko's to print some pages we forgot. We left the presentation that took nearly 6 weeks to create - on a USB in their computer.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/736/277/5d31940259d13a58b5d891016ac9c659_large.jpg?1373485182"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p> <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">When we arrived for the meeting and realized we didn't have the USB - we figured, no problem,  we'd go online and access our Drop Box account - the company's Internet was out - we made our apologizes and headed back to the airport.... an embarrassing and expensive moment. </span><em style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><strong>We had joined the over  ONE MILLION + folks that lose their USB's yearly.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">That same week, a friend told us about a party where a party goer had hacked his Smart Phone and ""borrowed""  most of the other party goers credit card numbers without them knowing - he thought it was a funny trick. Our friend said it basically ""creeped"" everyone at the party out.</span><br/></p>
<p> We've all heard about skimmers <em>(about the size of a Netbook</em>) for stealing credit card info via RFID - but we never  heard of something as simple as a Smartphone.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""344"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1NgCDYNhgA?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent"" width=""612""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So we began making sketches and prototypes to see if it would be feasible to create an <strong><em>RFID Blocking, USB, Small, Simple, Functional Minimal Wallet that felt great to carry.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p></p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We also wanted to concentrate  on the weight factor with the Synergos Design <em>- The heavier the wallet, the more noticeable</em> <em>it becomes over a long day<strong>.  Synergos Wallet weighs just at one ounce.</strong></em></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><em><strong><img alt=""A Synergos Wallet weighs just ONE OUNCE - less tha 6 nickles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/818/884/5e15a4c6295391168f12d7e200205414_large.JPG?1376153857"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></strong></em></em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>-We also felt it important to be able to  get our cash in and out easily. Many of the Minimal Wallets we own have an inherent awkwardness to their designs for getting paper bills in and out. So we chose to create a slim and efficient <em>""Money Card</em>"" to solve the problem.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> We considered a money clip/ band, but felt the use of a money clip or an exterior elastic band - for us -  we felt it would take away from the aesthetics of the wallet's cleanly defined lines.</em></strong></p>

<p>So after a number of months of prototyping we were able to Mashup<em> all our wants and needs into a simple clean Minimal</em> <em>Piece</em> - <strong>with just the right balance of form, function, </strong>which we love to carry in our pockets everyday. </p>

Synergos Wallet Makes Your Life Simpler
OUR STORY
We're fans and users of minimal wallets. Their very nature disciplines you to streamline a small part of your everyday life - to bring only what you truly need for the 10-12 hours per day you're carrying a wallet - not the junk that somehow accumulates over time in a traditional wallet or purse.
(Did you notice in the video the traditional wallet in the back pocket how about the Synergos? Can you find the Synergos?)
The choice between an uncomfortable traditional wallet in your back pocket - (which has the potential of damaging your sciatic nerve over time) or a front pocket Minimal Wallet, is for us, a no brainer. We're fans of the Minimal aesthetic.


SYNERGOS WALLET vs A TRADITIONAL WALLET

 Synergos Wallet started about seven months ago after a series of events pointed us in its direction. The first was going to see a potential new client  (a 1200 mile trip). Just before the presentation, our team stopped at a FedEx/Kinko's to print some pages we forgot. We left the presentation that took nearly 6 weeks to create - on a USB in their computer.

 When we arrived for the meeting and realized we didn't have the USB - we figured, no problem,  we'd go online and access our Drop Box account - the company's Internet was out - we made our apologizes and headed back to the airport.... an embarrassing and expensive moment. We had joined the over  ONE MILLION + folks that lose their USB's yearly.
That same week, a friend told us about a party where a party goer had hacked his Smart Phone and ""borrowed""  most of the other party goers credit card numbers without them knowing - he thought it was a funny trick. Our friend said it basically ""creeped"" everyone at the party out.
 We've all heard about skimmers (about the size of a Netbook) for stealing credit card info via RFID - but we never  heard of something as simple as a Smartphone.


So we began making sketches and prototypes to see if it would be feasible to create an RFID Blocking, USB, Small, Simple, Functional Minimal Wallet that felt great to carry.







One of the first prototypes we tested to make sure we were on the right track for the RFID blocking.


We also wanted to concentrate  on the weight factor with the Synergos Design - The heavier the wallet, the more noticeable it becomes over a long day.  Synergos Wallet weighs just at one ounce.



-We also felt it important to be able to  get our cash in and out easily. Many of the Minimal Wallets we own have an inherent awkwardness to their designs for getting paper bills in and out. So we chose to create a slim and efficient ""Money Card"" to solve the problem.
 We considered a money clip/ band, but felt the use of a money clip or an exterior elastic band - for us -  we felt it would take away from the aesthetics of the wallet's cleanly defined lines.



More Testing to make sure the Money Card helped make our money and lives easier

So after a number of months of prototyping we were able to Mashup all our wants and needs into a simple clean Minimal Piece - with just the right balance of form, function, which we love to carry in our pockets everyday. 

So small you don't know it's in your pocket - but yet can carry all the information you may need.


SYNERGOS WALLET'S precision machining feels at home in any environment.

How we got there

- We wanted a wallet that was small, simple, easy to use and made our lives easier and maybe a bit more fun.
- We wanted to integrate  a USB that was so unobtrusive we wouldn't know it was even there - resumes, videos,  presentations, games, storage, backups, virus cleanup, etc - could now easily come with us - fortunately we've never left our wallet behind - but have over the years left behind a half a dozen USB's.
- We wanted to be able to get paper money in and out of our Minimal Wallets easily.
- We wanted to stop thieves from skimming our credit card info.
- We wanted the wallet to be so slight (1 ounce) you would not even feel it    in your pocket even after a 10 - 12 hour day.
     _____________________________________________________________
Here's a few of the steps we used
After the first rough hand made prototypes we had a CAD program done for the metal parts we needed.

 
Testing of various elastic brands & tensil strengths

Testing of placement and configurations of chips

Swapping out bands on the Anza watch is very simple. There are no pins to remove, the bands slide easily in and out of the watch body.Q: Is the watch waterproof?A. The Anza watch is water resistant up to 10 ATM (100M).Q. Is this watch battery powered?A. Yes, the Anza watch is a quartz movement (battery powered) and the battery is built to last approximately 2 years. The battery is replaceable.Q: Is this watch visible in the dark?A. The Anza watch features Superluminova hands and numerals for optimal viewing in multiple environments.  Q: Can I buy extra straps?A. The watches ship with 2 straps at this time and when the watch starts shipping in September, we will have replacement straps available.  Thank you!",75.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>MEET AND
GREET ………………………………………………………………...........</strong></p>
</div><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p>My name is Dollie,
and I am one of the co- founders of Dollica.  I’m a fun
loving girl who adores jewelry, ice cream, morning runs, swimming,
thunderstorms and butterflies.  </p><div>
</div><p>In January of 2012, I was diagnosed
with stage III breast cancer.  Never in a million years did I think I
would be diagnosed with cancer and especially at the young age of 31.  I
considered myself to be a healthy person. I worked out on a regular basis and mostly
ate healthy with the exception of my ice cream escapades. Thankfully the cancer
had not spread to other parts of my body.  But needless to say, after my
diagnosis my life seemed to be turned upside down……..</p><div>
</div><p>What would I do next? I became obsessed
with worrying about the future and things that I had no way of changing.
 “What if” became a constant fixture in my mind. I eventually realized that I wanted something to
replace the fear about my diagnosis. Before 2012, life was happening at high speed
and with an active family the pastimes that I enjoyed doing sometimes got
bumped to last on the “to-do” list. It was time to revise my priorities and push the little
enjoyments in life a bit higher on the list. That’s when I found time to
explore jewelry making. It was something that I really took pleasure in doing! And
during chemo, it was an escape for me. Assembling jewelry was an endorphin release
and the distraction that I was looking for. </p><div>
</div><p>  My cancer diagnosis inspired me to start making
pieces that highlight breast cancer awareness. It was a way for me to express
myself without any limitations. That experience has developed into a full
fledged dream to make beautiful jewelry that inspires others to never stop
believing. I have learned that we should try to embrace any challenges; because
in the end, challenges are what create depth and backbone. Sometimes you have
to go through the “bad” stuff to get to the “good” stuff. Today I am a two year
cancer survivor!!!!! And I’m happy to say that there is plenty of phenomenal
stuff to come from Dollica! </p><div>
</div><p>My name is Angelica and I am the second half of Dollica. To
sum me up in a nut shell, I’m a goof ball, a hard worker who loves ice cream,
traveling, a good chick flick or comedy, a juicy read, some Sunday football,
music, the arts and twinkling lights. I’m a self proclaimed jewelry freak and
I’m passionate about leaving the world a little better than I found it. </p><div>
</div><p>At 28 years old, I feel humbled to have found my passion
early on and work within my desired industry. I’ve worked as a Merchandise
Coordinator for a jewelry company that mass produces &amp; supplies to
reputable catalog and television outlets. And I’m currently working as a
Marketing and Sales Manager for a fine jewelry brand. I’m obsessed with
beautiful gemstones and find the details of jewelry design to be fascinating.
My creative energies are bursting at the seams and are ready to be unleashed to
the public. It was an inspiration to see my sister take on the life altering
experience with such determination and poise. And this event has also taught me
to actively pursue your dreams because life is too unpredictable to do
otherwise. I’ve always wanted to achieve entrepreneurship and my working experience
gives me the confidence to take on the expectations for our desired industry. </p><div>
</div><p>I believe that the timing is perfect for both my sister and
I to take our dream to the next level. After all, we’ve been prepping since the
days of playing dress up in our mommy’s closet! And by combining the love of
striking jewels with our passion to help fund a cure for the illness that
touched our family in a personal way, we are presenting a collection with heart.
I, along with my sister are excited to launch Dollica and present a gorgeous
compilation of fine jewelry that women will love to wear and feel good about
purchasing!</p><ul></ul><div>

thunderstorms and butterflies.  
In January of 2012, I was diagnosed
with stage III breast cancer.  Never in a million years did I think I
would be diagnosed with cancer and especially at the young age of 31.  I
considered myself to be a healthy person. I worked out on a regular basis and mostly
ate healthy with the exception of my ice cream escapades. Thankfully the cancer
had not spread to other parts of my body.  But needless to say, after my
diagnosis my life seemed to be turned upside down……..
What would I do next? I became obsessed
with worrying about the future and things that I had no way of changing.
 “What if” became a constant fixture in my mind. I eventually realized that I wanted something to
replace the fear about my diagnosis. Before 2012, life was happening at high speed
and with an active family the pastimes that I enjoyed doing sometimes got
bumped to last on the “to-do” list. It was time to revise my priorities and push the little
enjoyments in life a bit higher on the list. That’s when I found time to
explore jewelry making. It was something that I really took pleasure in doing! And
during chemo, it was an escape for me. Assembling jewelry was an endorphin release
and the distraction that I was looking for. 
  My cancer diagnosis inspired me to start making
pieces that highlight breast cancer awareness. It was a way for me to express
myself without any limitations. That experience has developed into a full
fledged dream to make beautiful jewelry that inspires others to never stop
believing. I have learned that we should try to embrace any challenges; because
in the end, challenges are what create depth and backbone. Sometimes you have
to go through the “bad” stuff to get to the “good” stuff. Today I am a two year
cancer survivor!!!!! And I’m happy to say that there is plenty of phenomenal
stuff to come from Dollica! 
My name is Angelica and I am the second half of Dollica. To
sum me up in a nut shell, I’m a goof ball, a hard worker who loves ice cream,
traveling, a good chick flick or comedy, a juicy read, some Sunday football,
music, the arts and twinkling lights. I’m a self proclaimed jewelry freak and
I’m passionate about leaving the world a little better than I found it. 
At 28 years old, I feel humbled to have found my passion
early on and work within my desired industry. I’ve worked as a Merchandise
Coordinator for a jewelry company that mass produces & supplies to
reputable catalog and television outlets. And I’m currently working as a
Marketing and Sales Manager for a fine jewelry brand. I’m obsessed with
beautiful gemstones and find the details of jewelry design to be fascinating.
My creative energies are bursting at the seams and are ready to be unleashed to
the public. It was an inspiration to see my sister take on the life altering
experience with such determination and poise. And this event has also taught me
to actively pursue your dreams because life is too unpredictable to do
otherwise. I’ve always wanted to achieve entrepreneurship and my working experience
gives me the confidence to take on the expectations for our desired industry. 
I believe that the timing is perfect for both my sister and
I to take our dream to the next level. After all, we’ve been prepping since the
days of playing dress up in our mommy’s closet! And by combining the love of
striking jewels with our passion to help fund a cure for the illness that
touched our family in a personal way, we are presenting a collection with heart.
I, along with my sister are excited to launch Dollica and present a gorgeous
compilation of fine jewelry that women will love to wear and feel good about
purchasing!

We sell fine leather goods without the luxury markup.<br/><br/>We started Linjer because we ourselves struggled to find high-quality leather laptop bags that we could actually afford. They all seemed to cost well above $1,200. <br/><br/>At some point we learned of the outrageous markups that luxury brands place on their leather goods. In many cases, retail prices can be 10 or 20 times the production price!<br/><br/>We thought: why don’t we start our own brand, sell directly to customers and cut out all the needless costs? Then more people (including ourselves and our friends) can actually dream of owning beautiful, well-made leather products! 

<br/><br/>So here we are! Our products are crafted with premium materials alongside products of top luxury brands. We design everything in house. We keep our prices lower by selling directly to customers; cutting out middlemen, storefront costs and inefficient marketing spend; and not marking our products up just because.</p><br/><p style=""text-align: center; font-family: 'proxima nova', verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0.06em; margin: 0 10%;"">We've come to Indiegogo to raise funds so that we can place orders for leather and fund our next production at the factory.

<br/><p style=""text-align: center; font-family: 'proxima nova', verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0.06em; margin: 0 10%;""><b>WHAT DOES ""VEGETABLE-TANNED"" MEAN?</b><br/><br/>Vegetable tanning is the traditional tanning method refined by the Spanish, Italians and French during the Renaissance. Today it makes up only 10% of leather produced. Unaided by potent chemicals, vegetable tanning takes much longer than chrome tanning (several weeks/months vs a day). As a result, it can be more expensive…but it’s worth it. Vegetable-tanned leather looks natural, smells sweet and develops a unique patina over time.</p>
<br/><p style=""text-align: center; font-family: 'proxima nova', verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0.06em; margin: 0 10%;""><b>WHAT IS ""FULL GRAIN"" LEATHER?</b><br/><br/>The top surface of a hide, or the grain, is the strongest part of the hide. ""Full grain"" means that the surface has not been buffed or sanded to remove imperfections. It is much longer-lasting and durable than top-grain leather (which has been buffed or sanded) or split-grain leather (which doesn't have any grain at all). Top-grain leather is more prevalent on the market because it's cheaper to buy low-quality leather and buff off the defects than to buy quality hides.</p>

<b>Delivery time</b>: For our first pre-order campaign, we were marginally late with delivery of the first batch of products (~1-2 weeks) as we had some issues with our box manufacturer. However, the first time is always the roughest, and we've since straightened out our supply chain. We're confident that we'll be able to fulfill according to schedule. We'll also try our best to deliver ahead of schedule.<br/><br/><b>Duty/VAT charges</b>: If you live outside of the US, you will be responsible for any applicable duty/VAT charges.<br/><br/><b>Customs</b>: Some countries are known for being very slow with customs, and you probably know if you live in one. We're sorry that we can't put a magic stamp on our packages to help them get through faster.

We'll update you frequently about our progress, and if there are any blips along the way, we'll let you know!

Hi! We are Roman and Jenn, the founders of Linjer.
</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'proxima nova', verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0.06em; margin: 0 10%;""><br/>
We started Linjer because we ourselves struggled to find high-quality leather goods that didn't break the bank. At some point we learned of the outrageous markups that luxury brands place on their leather goods.
</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'proxima nova', verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0.06em; margin: 0 10%;""><br/>

We thought: why don’t we start our own brand, sell directly to customers and cut out all the needless costs? Then more people (including ourselves and our friends) could actually dream of owning beautiful, well-made leather products.
</p>
<br/>
<p style=""font-family: 'proxima nova', verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0.06em; margin: 0 10%;"">

So we did. We spent a couple years preparing our first collection, which we launched on Indiegogo in October. We met our funding goal of $50,000 within 48 hours. The support from our backers enabled us to place our first orders for leather and fund our first production run. 
</p>
<br/>
<p style=""font-family: 'proxima nova', verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em; letter-spacing: 0.06em; margin: 0 10%;"">

We've already shipped many orders and we're delighted by the enthusiastic reception from our early backers. We're really excited to share our second collection with you!

</div></div>","We sell fine leather goods without the luxury markup.We started Linjer because we ourselves struggled to find high-quality leather laptop bags that we could actually afford. They all seemed to cost well above $1,200. At some point we learned of the outrageous markups that luxury brands place on their leather goods. In many cases, retail prices can be 10 or 20 times the production price!We thought: why don’t we start our own brand, sell directly to customers and cut out all the needless costs? Then more people (including ourselves and our friends) can actually dream of owning beautiful, well-made leather products! 

So here we are! Our products are crafted with premium materials alongside products of top luxury brands. We design everything in house. We keep our prices lower by selling directly to customers; cutting out middlemen, storefront costs and inefficient marketing spend; and not marking our products up just because.We've come to Indiegogo to raise funds so that we can place orders for leather and fund our next production at the factory. We'd be grateful for your help in reaching our fundraising goal of $15,000 USD!

As a result, it can be more expensive…but it’s worth it. Vegetable-tanned leather looks natural, smells sweet and develops a unique patina over time.
WHAT IS ""FULL GRAIN"" LEATHER?The top surface of a hide, or the grain, is the strongest part of the hide. ""Full grain"" means that the surface has not been buffed or sanded to remove imperfections. It is much longer-lasting and durable than top-grain leather (which has been buffed or sanded) or split-grain leather (which doesn't have any grain at all). Top-grain leather is more prevalent on the market because it's cheaper to buy low-quality leather and buff off the defects than to buy quality hides.

NOTES

Delivery time: For our first pre-order campaign, we were marginally late with delivery of the first batch of products (~1-2 weeks) as we had some issues with our box manufacturer. However, the first time is always the roughest, and we've since straightened out our supply chain. We're confident that we'll be able to fulfill according to schedule. We'll also try our best to deliver ahead of schedule.Duty/VAT charges: If you live outside of the US, you will be responsible for any applicable duty/VAT charges.Customs: Some countries are known for being very slow with customs, and you probably know if you live in one. We're sorry that we can't put a magic stamp on our packages to help them get through faster.

We'll update you frequently about our progress, and if there are any blips along the way, we'll let you know!



ABOUT THE FOUNDERS





Hi! We are Roman and Jenn, the founders of Linjer.


We started Linjer because we ourselves struggled to find high-quality leather goods that didn't break the bank. At some point we learned of the outrageous markups that luxury brands place on their leather goods.



We thought: why don’t we start our own brand, sell directly to customers and cut out all the needless costs? Then more people (including ourselves and our friends) could actually dream of owning beautiful, well-made leather products.




So we did. We spent a couple years preparing our first collection, which we launched on Indiegogo in October. We met our funding goal of $50,000 within 48 hours. The support from our backers enabled us to place our first orders for leather and fund our first production run. 




We've already shipped many orders and we're delighted by the enthusiastic reception from our early backers. We're really excited to share our second collection with you!


Thank you for your support!

<p>I’m Thulare Monareng, a South African fashion designer and creator of <strong>The Fashion Deli</strong>, which is a unique concept store, that I first opened in Cape Town, South Africa in 2011, specializing in <strong>ethically produced</strong> and <strong>sustainable</strong> fashion &amp; lifestyle products <strong><em>inspired by</em></strong> and <strong><em>made in Africa</em></strong> </p>
<p>My <strong><em>DREAM</em></strong> is to bring this concept to New York and I need <strong><em>YOUR</em></strong> help!</p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>ABOUT THE FASHION DELI</strong></em></p>
<p>The creation and launch of The Fashion Deli, was conceived to leverage a niche retail opportunity for <strong>eco concious<em>, made in Africa</em></strong> brands, as well as to provide consumers with an exciting, experiential and sustainably conscious retail alternative.</p>
<p>We carefully select and work with some of Africa’s most talented designers, who are committed to ethical &amp; sustainable design as well as the long-term development of Africa’s creative, textile and manufacturing industries.</p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>WHY THIS MATTERS</strong></em></p>
<p>Africa has long been regarded as a mysterious, beautiful and tragic continent. Acknowledged by world leaders as a continent of abounding potential, it is also leading the world of sustainable fashion and has become the go-to destination for ethical designers due to highly skilled artisans, raw materials &amp; rich culture.</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years I have had the pleasure of travelling throughout Africa, meeting  &amp; working with some of these talented designers and artisans and have developed an immense passion and commitment to exposing their vision to the world. It is this journey that inspired the Fashion Deli, and it is my hope that it will inspire <strong>you</strong> just the same.</p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Our Goals</strong></em></p>
<p>1. To showcase ethically produced &amp; sustainable fashion and lifestyle products <strong>inspired by</strong> and <strong>made</strong><strong> in Africa</strong>.</p>
<p>2.  To provide a unique globally focused retail platform for emerging and established African designers, whose exquisite products would otherwise go unrecognized.</p>
<p>3. To build iconic African designer brands and manufacturing capabilities on the continent for the international market.</p>
<p>4. To encourage an awareness of the diversity in talent, ingenuity and creativity found on the African continent.</p>
<p>5.  To challenge misconceptions about Africa and African design, art &amp; culture.</p>
<p>6. To connect with our customers in an experiential and interactive way.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>ABOUT THE CONCEPT</strong></em></p>
<p>As opposed to the traditional rails and racks of department stores, The Fashion Deli re-imagines the classic delicatessen as a unique retail experience. With social and ethical responsibility at the core of our business, we adhere to fair trade principles in the sourcing, manufacturing and retail of ALL our products. As a result brands are merchandised in repurposed refrigerators, ice cream freezers and beverage crates, and packaged in recycled pizza boxes, ice cream tubs, brown paper bags and other innovative packaging.</p>
<p>The Fashion Deli teaches the world that sustainability, style and presentation fused with creative interaction is the way forward. It showcases African design differently than expected or typified, through fashion as art and innovative retail. It mirrors the electric energy of contemporary Africa and represents the most promising talent of the Africa’s creative explosion.</p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></em></p>
<p>It is our mission to become the world’s pre-eminent purveyor of cutting edge African designer fashion &amp; lifestyle products, as well as to Influence, inform and inspire consumers by stimulating dialogue around contemporary African design, art and culture.</p>
<p>The next step, towards achieving this goal, is to bring the Fashion Deli to New York, for a month long, Pop-Up store, during New York Fashion Week in September. This is strategically intended to broaden brand awareness of The Fashion Deli and our featured designers and products within the US market, as well as laying the foundation for a permanent flagship store in New York, where our market research indicates a lucrative, niche retail opportunity, for our specific brands and products.</p>
<p>Our goal therefore is to raise a total of $175,000 to bring this project to life. Our expenses include store rental in a strategically located area of New York to ensure maximum foot traffic and exposure to our target customers, fixtures &amp; packaging in line with our eco-sustainable delicatessen concept, staff salaries, permits, insurance, travel, promotional costs, utilities, signage fit out and much more.</p>

<p><strong>YOU</strong> can help us realize this dream by making a financial contribution to <strong>OUR </strong>campaign. If you’re not in a position to contribute <strong>YOU</strong> can help by telling as many of your friends, family and colleagues as possible.

This is done by providing food, sustainable resources, and life saving aid to the world’s most vulnerable as well as creating a global commitment to mobilize the necessary support for transformational development programs.</p>

Simply, a world without hunger.









How will it work?


Each global tie has the potential to feed a defined amount of people. Transparency is our main focus. We strive to ensure that you know exactly what kinds of changes are being made with the funding of Global Ties.

Perks!
There are three bracelets in our first collection of Global Ties:

Black Rope with Silver Pendant // Feed 12 Individuals
Brown Leather with Rose Gold Pendant // Feed 24 Individuals
Black Leather with Gold Pendant // Feed 48 Individuals

Black Rope // Silver
The bracelets have two adjustable knots to fit all.
Brown Leather // Rose Gold
Black Leather // Gold
Social Media // Help Spread Awareness
We can only push our campaign so much. Far greater changes can be enabled if our supporters help to spread the word about Global Ties. Sharing on any social media can be just as powerful as contributing for a bracelet.
It would only take a second to share our project with your loved ones, but it could mean a lifetime for someone in need.

Where will our funds go?

The majority of the funds raised will be allocated for the fulfillment of the defined metrics for each reward. The rest funds will go towards the production, distribution, and marketing of the first collection of Global Ties.
Manufacturing – We have already started production on a small scale. We now need your help to expand our movement on an international scale.
Marketing – You are ones behind powering this movement. We need every supporters' help to spread our message to friends and loved ones.
Growth – If successfully funded, we want to focus our efforts to other causes. We will create new collections of Global Ties among different products that will help create diversified change.
We have been working for the past year to ensure that all goes smoothly with this campaign. We have designed the product, lined up mass production, and partnered with a notable charity. We just need your help now. Each of us can make an impact. 


Our Mission:

To provide a service that creates opportunity for change. Through the power of consumers, we will be able to make a tangible change in the world.
This first campaign will focus on world's single biggest, but solvable issue; hunger.
Your support will contribute to towards the effort of ending hunger in our lifetime. This is done by providing food, sustainable resources, and life saving aid to the world’s most vulnerable as well as creating a global commitment to mobilize the necessary support for transformational development programs.
As we expand our mission, we will be able focus on other global issues such as a Clean Water Initiative, Poverty, HIV/AIDS, and Cancer.
Who we are:

Global Ties is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in San Francisco and operating in Los Angeles. Founder Steven Elliot is at third year student at UCLA currently.
Our Partners:


No animals were harmed in the manufacturing of our synthetic leather bracelets.

<br/><a href=""http://www.thegbelt.com/home_page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>What is ""The Gravity Edge Belt"" better known as ""The G Belt""</strong></a>
</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 150px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thegbelt.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/Belt_Ad_1.284124042_std.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>“The G Belt” is a exercise and fitness training enhancement product which can be used safely by runners, walkers, fitness and aerobic personnel, anyone training for any other leg related sport and people looking to lose weight quicker.  It is an adjustably weighted belt and is adjustable from 1 to 9 pounds.  It has a very specific memory foam cushioning system which allows the user to comfortably wear the belt around their waist or center of gravity and keeps the belt from moving around along with making sure the user doesn’t get bruised or chafed.  The weight itself goes all the way around the belt so that the user will always maintain perfect balance while wearing the belt.  It is made of water proof materials so it can get wet and dirty and yet clean up easily in a sink or shower without harming the belt especially the memory foam.<br/>    “The G Belt” was designed so that it would safely help runners, walkers, aerobic personnel and all other athletes become better at what they do while performing the same activities in the same amount of time they already do now.  It will make the user faster, stronger and in the case where the user is trying to lose weight the belt will help because it makes the user burn more calories when they use the belt in their workouts.  Once funded I will be able to get the belts made so that everyone needing to improve their performance will be able to do so in less time.  Please help me help the athletes, military, police and firemen.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.thegbelt.com/home_page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(Click here for more information and educational Videos)</a><br/>    </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Who Really Can Benefit From ""The G Belt""?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Runners:</strong> While running the same mileage and workouts you already do now only with the added weight around your center of gravity forcing you to work harder, get stronger legs and a fitter cardiovascular sysytem.  Then on race day you leave the belt at home and you show up feeling lighter, stronger, faster and race faster times. ""<em>(The PR Maker) Belt""</em></p>
<p><strong>Walkers:</strong>  You do the same walks at the same pace for the same milage you already do now but with the added weight around your center of gravity you get stronger, slimmer legs and burn more calories per mile causing you to lose weight quicker than you would have without the belt.  ""<em>(The Body Slimmer, Fat Burning) Belt""</em></p>
<p><strong>Aerobic Personnel and Dancers:</strong>  You go to your aerobc or dance class or stay at home performing your activities in front of your TV only now with the added weight around your center of gravity.  No matter what activity you do your legs and cardiovascular system are forced to work harder, you burn more calories per hour and end up making yourself a stronger leaner you.  ""<em>(The Weight Lose, Fitness) Belt""</em></p>
<p><strong>Sport Athletes:</strong>  You go to practice and follow the same practice routines and activities your coach always has you perform.  The difference now is the added weight around your center of gravity will make every activity you perform harder allowing you to get more out of your practice in the same amount or less time.  You get stronger, faster, quicker, jump higher, become more agile and on game day perform better than you ever have before which then helps your team to victory.  ""<em>(The Game Changer) Belt"" or ""(The Scholarship Producing) Belt""</em></p>
<p><strong>Military Soldiers:</strong>  You need to be fit to stay alive in combat or to support other combat troops.  Every branch of the Military performs some form of PT ( Physical Training ) and utilizes many different exercises and activities.  With the extra weight around a soldiers center of gravity they will be forced to work harder and benefit by getting stronger and fitter in less time than they would have without the belt.  The military then gets a stronger, faster, fitter fighting force in less time.  ""<em>(The Super Soldier) Belt""</em></p>
<p><strong>Police and Firemen:</strong>  To save lives while keeping temselves alive in the process all police and firemen personnel train especially hard to get into and stay in top shape.  There are many ways they accomplish this but in every case if they increase the weight around their center of gravity they will achieve more in a faster time frame.  Then while on duty they will better be able to serve and protect better than they ever have before.  ""<em>(The Saves More Lives) Belt""</em></p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Funding Needed:</strong></h3>
<p>We need $30,000.00 to send to the manufacturer so that they can make the belts.  This money covers materials and labor.  I can’t sell the belt to anyone needing it until they get made.  Due to economy of scale and the price of the materials the more I have the manufacturer make the less the price is to make each one.  These are the savings I want to pass on to the comsumer so I am hoping to see at least 750 sold for the first run.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 210px;"">***IMPORTANT NOTICE*** </h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Delivery Schedule:</h3>
<p>Due to the ramp up of manufacturing there will be a restriction put on the delivery dates of the belts ordered.  I hope everyone will be patient with us while we get through these early months of production.  These will be established on a first to order the belt will be the first to receive the belt basis.  Shortly after this campaign is over everyone who has ordered a belt will receive an email update which will give you an approximate date of delivery of the belt you have ordered.  To get the belt soonest you must try and be one of the first to place your order.  The number amounts and delivery dates will go as follows:  <br/><br/>The first 500 orders of “The G Belt” will get made and delivered starting May 01, 2013 until July 01, 2013.  After that any other belts ordered will be delivered after July 01, 2013 but no later than September 01, 2013 no matter what the number of belts that get ordered.  After September 01, 2013 any belts ordered will be shipped out with no more than a two week wait.  </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">
<br/><strong>What are Athletes Looking for?</strong>
</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 180px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://thegbelt.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/2013-03-17_13-29-39_231.75111015_std.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Athletes are always looking for an edge to make themselves better, faster and stronger athletes so their chances of winning go up.  Other people need or want to lose weight so they can be healthier and look better.  In both cases, some people have chosen not so safe, legal or healthy ways of achieving their goals.  Blood doping, steroids and very unhealthy weight lose drugs find their way into these peoples lives.  We read about this in the news way to often. </p>
<p>One of the ways which can help prevent this from happening is the use of the Gravity Edge Belt or “The G Belt” by these athletes and weight lose personnel.  ""The G Belt"" will help these personnel achieve their goals without having to seek out the alternative bad solutions.  We especially want to help the younger people choose ""The G Belt"" over the alternatives so that they can achieve greater results while staying clean and healthy.  In the end we hope to help everyone looking to better themselves as an athlete, fitness or weight lose personnel so that they may achieve all of their own personnal endeavors and goals. </p>
<p>Victory Within Reach!!!  Go Ahead, EXCEL!!!</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">
<strong>T</strong><strong>his Campaigns Main Objectives:</strong>   </h3>
<p>As part of this campaign we are not only hoping to raise the money we need to get ""The G Belt's"" manufactured but to get the word out that there is now a better alternative to better training and training practices.  Please if you know anyone you think could use this product let them know right away.  If you know or can get in contact with your local Athletic Director or School Coaches please lead them to this campaign so they can take advantage of the group discounts for all of their athletes and kids.  If you know of a Soldier, Policemen or Firemen also let them know about this new product and the many ways it can help them in their endevors.  Even if the only people you know are simply fighting their own weight gains and loses can be greatly helped by this product and should be told of it's existance. </p>
<p>Together we can all help make better, safer, healthier persons and athletes of everyone we know.</p>

<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: georgia,palatino;""><strong>Three Sizes of The Belt:  </strong>The Small Belt fits 26"" to 30"" waist lines, The Medium Belt fits 30"" to 34"" waist lines and the Large Belt fits 34"" to 38"" waist lines.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: georgia,palatino;""><strong>Two 360 Degree Weight Chambers:</strong>  These allow for easy changing of the two different weighted Bean Bags and hold the weighted Bean Bags tightly and securely around the wearer's waist.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: georgia,palatino;""><strong>Two Differently Weighted Bean Bags:</strong>  There are two differently weighted bean bags for each size Belt, making for three differently weighted options for each size Belt.  <strong>The Small Belt</strong> comes with 1 1/2 and 3 1/2 pound bean bags and makes the three weighted options for this size belt either 1, 2 1/2, 4 1/2 or 6 pounds.  <strong>The Medium Belt</strong> comes with 2 and 4 pound bean bags and makes the three weighted options for this size belt either 1, 3, 5 or 7 pounds.  <strong>The Large Belt</strong> comes with 3 and 5 pound bean bags and makes the three weighted options for this size belt either 1, 4, 6 or 9 pounds.</span></li>

<li><span style=""font-family: georgia,palatino;""><strong>Waterproof Material:</strong>  The entire Belt is made with high strength waterproof material to ensure it holds up to all sorts of weather, sweat and use.  It allows for easy cleaning after use with a simple washing in the sink or shower and drys quickly afterwards so it is ready for the next use.</span></li>

<p><span style=""font-family: georgia,palatino;"">Running and almost all other sports require you to push your body as fast and as far as you can.  You do this by exerting your body weight against the natural force of gravity.  Regardless of your size and weight, your body over time learns to adapt.  </span><br/><span style=""font-family: georgia,palatino;"">The more you train against the force of gravity, the more efficiently your body adjusts to it and the faster and further you can run and perform all athletic endeavors.</span> </p>

<p><span style=""font-family: georgia,palatino;"">Now, increase your own body weight during your training and your body will adapt even more to the force of gravity to overcome it’s basic effect.  You will gradually become stronger and faster, because of the added weight.  In short, you will accomplish more.  Once you have become stronger and faster by training at the heavier weight, we want you to do the following: </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: georgia,palatino;"">Hello:  My name is James Garrett, President and CEO of Sport and Fitness Propulsion.  I am a former national class distance runner and winner of three of the seven marathons I competed in.  I have a Sport Management degree from Slippery Rock University were I studied Anatomy, Anatomy and Physiology, Exercise Physiology, and Kinesiology just to name a few of the studies I have taken.  It is the running and school experience that helped me design and develop my new product “The Gravity Edge Belt” better known as “The G Belt”. <a href=""http://site.sportandfitnesspro.com/about_us/presidents_bio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(Click here for full Bio:)</a></span></p>

</div></div>","What is ""The Gravity Edge Belt"" better known as ""The G Belt""


“The G Belt” is a exercise and fitness training enhancement product which can be used safely by runners, walkers, fitness and aerobic personnel, anyone training for any other leg related sport and people looking to lose weight quicker.  It is an adjustably weighted belt and is adjustable from 1 to 9 pounds.  It has a very specific memory foam cushioning system which allows the user to comfortably wear the belt around their waist or center of gravity and keeps the belt from moving around along with making sure the user doesn’t get bruised or chafed.  The weight itself goes all the way around the belt so that the user will always maintain perfect balance while wearing the belt.  It is made of water proof materials so it can get wet and dirty and yet clean up easily in a sink or shower without harming the belt especially the memory foam.    “The G Belt” was designed so that it would safely help runners, walkers, aerobic personnel and all other athletes become better at what they do while performing the same activities in the same amount of time they already do now.  It will make the user faster, stronger and in the case where the user is trying to lose weight the belt will help because it makes the user burn more calories when they use the belt in their workouts.  Once funded I will be able to get the belts made so that everyone needing to improve their performance will be able to do so in less time.  Please help me help the athletes, military, police and firemen.
(Click here for more information and educational Videos)    
Who Really Can Benefit From ""The G Belt""?
Runners: While running the same mileage and workouts you already do now only with the added weight around your center of gravity forcing you to work harder, get stronger legs and a fitter cardiovascular sysytem.  Then on race day you leave the belt at home and you show up feeling lighter, stronger, faster and race faster times. ""(The PR Maker) Belt""
Walkers:  You do the same walks at the same pace for the same milage you already do now but with the added weight around your center of gravity you get stronger, slimmer legs and burn more calories per mile causing you to lose weight quicker than you would have without the belt.  ""(The Body Slimmer, Fat Burning) Belt""
Aerobic Personnel and Dancers:  You go to your aerobc or dance class or stay at home performing your activities in front of your TV only now with the added weight around your center of gravity.  No matter what activity you do your legs and cardiovascular system are forced to work harder, you burn more calories per hour and end up making yourself a stronger leaner you.  ""(The Weight Lose, Fitness) Belt""
Sport Athletes:  You go to practice and follow the same practice routines and activities your coach always has you perform.  The difference now is the added weight around your center of gravity will make every activity you perform harder allowing you to get more out of your practice in the same amount or less time.  You get stronger, faster, quicker, jump higher, become more agile and on game day perform better than you ever have before which then helps your team to victory.  ""(The Game Changer) Belt"" or ""(The Scholarship Producing) Belt""
Military Soldiers:  You need to be fit to stay alive in combat or to support other combat troops.  Every branch of the Military performs some form of PT ( Physical Training ) and utilizes many different exercises and activities.  With the extra weight around a soldiers center of gravity they will be forced to work harder and benefit by getting stronger and fitter in less time than they would have without the belt.  The military then gets a stronger, faster, fitter fighting force in less time.  ""(The Super Soldier) Belt""
Police and Firemen:  To save lives while keeping temselves alive in the process all police and firemen personnel train especially hard to get into and stay in top shape.  There are many ways they accomplish this but in every case if they increase the weight around their center of gravity they will achieve more in a faster time frame.  Then while on duty they will better be able to serve and protect better than they ever have before.  ""(The Saves More Lives) Belt""
 
Funding Needed:
We need $30,000.00 to send to the manufacturer so that they can make the belts.  This money covers materials and labor.  I can’t sell the belt to anyone needing it until they get made.  Due to economy of scale and the price of the materials the more I have the manufacturer make the less the price is to make each one.  These are the savings I want to pass on to the comsumer so I am hoping to see at least 750 sold for the first run.
***IMPORTANT NOTICE*** 
Delivery Schedule:
Due to the ramp up of manufacturing there will be a restriction put on the delivery dates of the belts ordered.  I hope everyone will be patient with us while we get through these early months of production.  These will be established on a first to order the belt will be the first to receive the belt basis.  Shortly after this campaign is over everyone who has ordered a belt will receive an email update which will give you an approximate date of delivery of the belt you have ordered.  To get the belt soonest you must try and be one of the first to place your order.  The number amounts and delivery dates will go as follows:  The first 500 orders of “The G Belt” will get made and delivered starting May 01, 2013 until July 01, 2013.  After that any other belts ordered will be delivered after July 01, 2013 but no later than September 01, 2013 no matter what the number of belts that get ordered.  After September 01, 2013 any belts ordered will be shipped out with no more than a two week wait.  

What are Athletes Looking for?


Athletes are always looking for an edge to make themselves better, faster and stronger athletes so their chances of winning go up.  Other people need or want to lose weight so they can be healthier and look better.  In both cases, some people have chosen not so safe, legal or healthy ways of achieving their goals.  Blood doping, steroids and very unhealthy weight lose drugs find their way into these peoples lives.  We read about this in the news way to often. 
One of the ways which can help prevent this from happening is the use of the Gravity Edge Belt or “The G Belt” by these athletes and weight lose personnel.  ""The G Belt"" will help these personnel achieve their goals without having to seek out the alternative bad solutions.  We especially want to help the younger people choose ""The G Belt"" over the alternatives so that they can achieve greater results while staying clean and healthy.  In the end we hope to help everyone looking to better themselves as an athlete, fitness or weight lose personnel so that they may achieve all of their own personnal endeavors and goals. 
Victory Within Reach!!!  Go Ahead, EXCEL!!!

This Campaigns Main Objectives:   
As part of this campaign we are not only hoping to raise the money we need to get ""The G Belt's"" manufactured but to get the word out that there is now a better alternative to better training and training practices.  Please if you know anyone you think could use this product let them know right away.  If you know or can get in contact with your local Athletic Director or School Coaches please lead them to this campaign so they can take advantage of the group discounts for all of their athletes and kids.  If you know of a Soldier, Policemen or Firemen also let them know about this new product and the many ways it can help them in their endevors.  Even if the only people you know are simply fighting their own weight gains and loses can be greatly helped by this product and should be told of it's existance. 
Together we can all help make better, safer, healthier persons and athletes of everyone we know.

Heavier weighted bean bags: will be available this summer as a sold seperatly item for anyone wanting to add even more weight to ""The G Belt"". 

 

""The G Belt's"" Many Features:


Three Sizes of The Belt:  The Small Belt fits 26"" to 30"" waist lines, The Medium Belt fits 30"" to 34"" waist lines and the Large Belt fits 34"" to 38"" waist lines.
Two 360 Degree Weight Chambers:  These allow for easy changing of the two different weighted Bean Bags and hold the weighted Bean Bags tightly and securely around the wearer's waist.
Two Differently Weighted Bean Bags:  There are two differently weighted bean bags for each size Belt, making for three differently weighted options for each size Belt.  The Small Belt comes with 1 1/2 and 3 1/2 pound bean bags and makes the three weighted options for this size belt either 1, 2 1/2, 4 1/2 or 6 pounds.  The Medium Belt comes with 2 and 4 pound bean bags and makes the three weighted options for this size belt either 1, 3, 5 or 7 pounds.  The Large Belt comes with 3 and 5 pound bean bags and makes the three weighted options for this size belt either 1, 4, 6 or 9 pounds.
360 Degree Memory Foam Padding: The Memory Foam is a specially selected foam which compresses to form a thin but very protective comfort layer around the wearer's waist.  It protects the wearer from chafing and bruising and makes the Belt very comfortable to wear.
Velcro Strapping:  This allows the wearer to easily put the Belt on and also allows for easy size adjustments.  We will later be using a hook and loop fastener to accomplish the same thing
Velcro Patch Area:  This area is found in the front section of the Belt and allows the wearer to attach many different items when on the go.  You will be able to attach your favorite music device, phone or pouch, which could hold almost anything such as your money, keys, ID or cards.  We will later be using a hook and loop fastener to accomplish the same thing.
Ear Phone Cord Holder:  This keeps the ear phone cord safely out of the wearer's way in the back of the belt and allows for ease of exercise without your cord getting in the way.
Waterproof Material:  The entire Belt is made with high strength waterproof material to ensure it holds up to all sorts of weather, sweat and use.  It allows for easy cleaning after use with a simple washing in the sink or shower and drys quickly afterwards so it is ready for the next use.


Additional Scienctific Information:
The Natural Force known as ""Gravity"":
Running and almost all other sports require you to push your body as fast and as far as you can.  You do this by exerting your body weight against the natural force of gravity.  Regardless of your size and weight, your body over time learns to adapt.  The more you train against the force of gravity, the more efficiently your body adjusts to it and the faster and further you can run and perform all athletic endeavors. 
""The Gravity Edge Belt"" Advantage:
Now, increase your own body weight during your training and your body will adapt even more to the force of gravity to overcome it’s basic effect.  You will gradually become stronger and faster, because of the added weight.  In short, you will accomplish more.  Once you have become stronger and faster by training at the heavier weight, we want you to do the following: 
          Remove the added weight on your race or game day.  Here is what you will experience:  
You will instantly feel lighter, stronger, and faster.  We guarantee you will excel like never before.  You will feel as if you are defying nature and gravity’s effect, and you will feel stronger and run faster and further on your race or game day than you ever thought possible. Here at Sport and Fitness Propulsion we have developed the perfect way to accomplish this instant weight gain, which in turn will allow you to push harder against gravity and in time accomplish much more than ever before.  It’s called “The Gravity Edge Belt,” better known as “The G Belt.” 
Go Ahead, EXCEL !!!

<br/><h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>State Line is ALL about regional pride and representing where you are from, no matter where you go. </p>
<p>I got the idea for State Line one day at work in Las Vegas, NV. This particular job gave me the opportunity to meet people every day from all over the world. While we all come from different places, one thing we all had in common was our sense of pride and joy that comes over us when we get the question""Where are you from?"" I began noticing that this passion was common amongst everyone, regardless of region! I instantly started thinking of ways I could create something for everyone that embodies that euphoric feeling we feel when discussing our home towns. </p>
<p>That is how State Line came to fruition! This campaign is important because it gives us all a voice, an opportunity to put our cities and states ""on the map"". Your contributions will help this come to past.</p>

</div><div> <p>I need to raise $800 to at least get started. The money will help fund my first two designs that you see in the video. Any more contributions, like maybe my stretch goal of $2,500, will allow me to expand my designs, grow the brand and get more cities and states represented at the beginning of launching rather than further down the line.<br/></p>
<p>As a result of your contributions not only will a new and unique clothing brand be launched, but you will receive something tangible for your participation. These perks can range anywhere from a personal shout out on our website, hand written thank you post card, logo stickers, to even merchandise!</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our entire goal, the funds received will still go towards developing the brand and bringing to the market whatever we can afford.</p>

<h3>Boutique on Wheels</h3>
<p>We all love food trucks...so why not a fashion truck? Mobile shops have sprung up all over the West Coast, and it is now time for the greater NYC area to share in the love. Nomad will feature a carefully curated selection of funky &amp; affordable ladies' fashions (and a few items for the guys too!) We strive to become a (mobile) destination where local artists can showcase their designs, and where customers can purchase wallet friendly, one-of-a-kind items in a fun and intimate space.</p>
<p>Our plan is to pop-up shop on the streets of Hoboken, NJ, park our truck at various NYC Flea Markets, visit colleges, and provide private party services.</p>
<p>But first, we need the truck.</p>
<h3>In The Driver's Seat</h3>
<p>I got the idea for Nomad in the early summer of 2012. In the two years since I had graduated from college, I'd held four jobs, all of which I disliked. I was plagued by my early-twenties-state-of-confusion, and got increasingly fed up letting my age determine my state of being.</p>
<p>It was then that I promised myself, I was going to love what I do, to truly enjoy getting up for work each day. Combining my love for travel, style, and self-expression, I formed Nomad Boutique, LLC in September and have been working fiercely around the clock to make our forecasted April 1st launch a reality.</p>
<p>I've enlisted close friend, Matt Friend, as my Head of Operations, and together we will run the day to day, road to road, efforts of this enterprise.</p>
<p>Finding funding for such a venture when you are young and have limited resources can be tasking, but there is not a doubt in my mind that we will accomplish this. Your help in purchasing this truck will bring us one step closer to hittin' the road.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Your Contribution</h3>
<p>While the overhead costs for a mobile retail shop are less than those of a traditional brick-and-mortar boutique, we still have a vast list of start-up expenses. However, one of our top priorities is the truck, and that is where you come in.</p>
<p><span>We are asking Indiegogo for $10,000, of which:</span></p>
<p>$8,000: used Chevy P30 Stepvan</p>
<p>$2,000: interior and exterior renovations for truck (matched with $2,000 of my own savings)</p>
<p>Anything additional will go towards the start up of our base inventory.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>On The Road</h3>
<p>Any help (even a hug!) takes us one step closer to getting Nomad on the road. Please help spread word of this IndieGoGo Campaign, and drop us a line if you are a designer interested in having your goods on the truck!</p>

<p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;'>Summary</span></p>
<p>We are a small authentic company consisting of myself (Catherine) and my partner James. I grew up in a small Kentish village around country pursuits and tweed and James grew up on the South Coast surrounded by water sports and bright colours. Touch of Tweed was born when James and I met a number of years ago in sunny Somerset.  We spotted a niche in the market to create a new brand that combined both our upbringings and styles, but stayed true to who we are.</p>
<p>We wanted something different so we designed and created our very first products; one male and one female sweatshirt.  These combine the fashions of both country and coast using high quality materials to give you durable, comfortable and well fitted garments.  </p>
<p>Our mission is to create that go to item of your wardrobe. Somewhere in everyone’s wardrobe there’s an item of clothing, you know the one, you've owned it for years, but it just keeps on giving!  We are that brand….perfect for long walks, a day on the beach, a summers evening BBQ, or indeed any occasion, whether causal or smart.  Our garments are made to last and journey with you...</p>
<p>Our campaign will bring our brand to life and hopefully take us to production, but not without your backing.  We are starting out with our original sweatshirts, but the more backing we receive, the more products we can offer you lovely people!  Your contributions will directly support British manufacturing to bring you the garments we know you'll love and treasure. </p>
<p>Your contribution will mean more than words can describe and allow us the opportunity to bring our ideas and dreams to life.   Sharing our story with you is so exciting and the support so far has been unbelievable.  We just need to get over this last hurdle to really make this happen!</p>
<p>We are unique, fresh and made in Britain, we are Touch of Tweed...</p>

<p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;'>What We</span><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;'> Need...</span></p>
<p>We need £20,000 to take our brand to full production..</p>
<p>We are offering a range of perks, our biggest includes being amongst the first to get our original sweatshirt (they only available to pre-order here, no where else). The RRP of theses are; £79.00 and for this one time only we are offering, 25% off RRP(£59) for the first 20 pledges of the required amount. Once these 20 pledges are up there will be another chance for 15% off the RRP (£67) to the next 25 pledges of the required amount. After these have all gone, the sweatshirts will be back to their RRP, so be quick to get your discount. </p>
<p>If you like us and our story but perhaps a sweatshirt isn't for you, any donation would be greatly appreciated, we are of course offering other perks for your kind donations so please take a look at what we have available. </p>
</div><div>
<p>Even if we don't reach our overall goal, your contributions will make a huge difference..  Why is that, I hear you ask?  Because much of the global fashion industry is opaque, exploitative and environmentally damaging, as Ghandi said: <i>'""There is no beauty in the finest cloth if it brings hunger and unhappiness'"".  </i> We are different, we love fashion, people and the environment and we don’t want our clothes to come at the cost of people or our planet.  The people who make our clothes deserve to be celebrated, along with British manufacturing as a whole. </p>
<p>You won't find us on your local high street or sat in a glitzy office.  Yes you could buy a cheaper sweatshirt from others, but if you care about the origins and story of that sweatshirt, or indeed any item of your wardrobe, please join us in our campaign and help make a difference (and look pretty damn cool and trendy in the process!)  Who doesn't love a Touch of Tweed?!</p>
<p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;'>What you get...</span></p>
<p>One male or one female British made sweatshirt; made in Sheffield by the talented team at Hall UK Manufacturing; made with proper manufacturing techniques by local ladies and gentlemen.  We are proud to be able to trace our steps to production and share this journey with you.</p>

We are a small authentic company consisting of myself (Catherine) and my partner James. I grew up in a small Kentish village around country pursuits and tweed and James grew up on the South Coast surrounded by water sports and bright colours. Touch of Tweed was born when James and I met a number of years ago in sunny Somerset.  We spotted a niche in the market to create a new brand that combined both our upbringings and styles, but stayed true to who we are.
We wanted something different so we designed and created our very first products; one male and one female sweatshirt.  These combine the fashions of both country and coast using high quality materials to give you durable, comfortable and well fitted garments.  
Our mission is to create that go to item of your wardrobe. Somewhere in everyone’s wardrobe there’s an item of clothing, you know the one, you've owned it for years, but it just keeps on giving!  We are that brand….perfect for long walks, a day on the beach, a summers evening BBQ, or indeed any occasion, whether causal or smart.  Our garments are made to last and journey with you...
Our campaign will bring our brand to life and hopefully take us to production, but not without your backing.  We are starting out with our original sweatshirts, but the more backing we receive, the more products we can offer you lovely people!  Your contributions will directly support British manufacturing to bring you the garments we know you'll love and treasure. 
Your contribution will mean more than words can describe and allow us the opportunity to bring our ideas and dreams to life.   Sharing our story with you is so exciting and the support so far has been unbelievable.  We just need to get over this last hurdle to really make this happen!
We are unique, fresh and made in Britain, we are Touch of Tweed...


What We Need...
We need £20,000 to take our brand to full production..
We are offering a range of perks, our biggest includes being amongst the first to get our original sweatshirt (they only available to pre-order here, no where else). The RRP of theses are; £79.00 and for this one time only we are offering, 25% off RRP(£59) for the first 20 pledges of the required amount. Once these 20 pledges are up there will be another chance for 15% off the RRP (£67) to the next 25 pledges of the required amount. After these have all gone, the sweatshirts will be back to their RRP, so be quick to get your discount. 
If you like us and our story but perhaps a sweatshirt isn't for you, any donation would be greatly appreciated, we are of course offering other perks for your kind donations so please take a look at what we have available. 

Even if we don't reach our overall goal, your contributions will make a huge difference..  Why is that, I hear you ask?  Because much of the global fashion industry is opaque, exploitative and environmentally damaging, as Ghandi said: '""There is no beauty in the finest cloth if it brings hunger and unhappiness'"".   We are different, we love fashion, people and the environment and we don’t want our clothes to come at the cost of people or our planet.  The people who make our clothes deserve to be celebrated, along with British manufacturing as a whole. 
You won't find us on your local high street or sat in a glitzy office.  Yes you could buy a cheaper sweatshirt from others, but if you care about the origins and story of that sweatshirt, or indeed any item of your wardrobe, please join us in our campaign and help make a difference (and look pretty damn cool and trendy in the process!)  Who doesn't love a Touch of Tweed?!
What you get...
One male or one female British made sweatshirt; made in Sheffield by the talented team at Hall UK Manufacturing; made with proper manufacturing techniques by local ladies and gentlemen.  We are proud to be able to trace our steps to production and share this journey with you.


The devil is in the detail... we use 100% Organic Cotton - it's thick, it's super soft and has a fleecy brushed-back lining.  We use small elements of high quality Tweed, but not just any tweed...ours is bright, it's beautiful and it's British.  We add high quality details to finish the look: Robust YKK zips finished in 'antique copper', providing you with the comfort that it won't fail after two goes.  We have branded buttons, zip pulls and leather patches to give those subtle hints that they are made with love, from us to you.  Finally we will be sending our products to you in packaging that is either made from recycled materials or can be fully recycled. 



** please be aware the cuff detailing is to change slightly - to a portrait piece of tweed not landscape.


Sizes...
We are offering a range of sizes, as follows:Ladies:Extra Small (UK 6)Small (UK 8/10)Medium (UK 12/14)Large (UK 16/18)Mens:Small MediumLargeExtra LargePlease note when making a purchase that all of the option boxes have to be filled, so please click 'no option' on the opposite sex garment to that of which you are ordering to make sure all boxes are complete.

The Impact

<p>With a unique geometry to the dial design there truly is no other dive watch quite like the Gin Clear Diver. The design acknowledges the vintage divers of the past but, through the combination of modern manufacturing techniques and the Second Hour Watches design language, the Gin Clear Diver has its eye firmly on the future.  We divided our dial up into thirds, with major markers at 12, 4 and 8 o'clock offsetting the rounded circular indexes at all other positions. We absolutely love the effect created, and believe it sets the Gin Clear Diver apart.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588291199/cghreilnjvqf24vzfsr6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Because of the build quality, careful selection of components and quality controls applied throughout the manufacture and post-manufacture stages the Gin Clear Diver can be relied upon to function at its peak for years to come. We not only strongly believe in what we have created, but are certain our watches will take pride of place in your collection, however large or small. The Gin Clear Diver dial design, just like our logo, embodies our love for sacred geometry. </p>

<p>After developing the design and specification requirements for the Gin Clear Diver, around 15 manufacturing partners were engaged and tested to gauge the quality of service and ability to correctly interpret the design. After a costly process of elimination, several prototypes were produced from just three remaining manufacturers. Once these were examined in the Second Hour Watches workshop there was one clear choice with whom to partner.</p>
<p>The Gin Clear Divers you see here today are the result of this exhaustive (and exhausting) search for the perfection we want to share with you. We know you'll agree that the Gin Clear Diver not only looks spectacular, but has outstanding specifications and finishing at a price point that cannot be matched.</p>
<p><strong>SO WHAT'S IN THE GIN CLEAR DIVER?</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588292111/y9xwiejxmuzfwvkvv3pr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DIMENSIONS</strong></p>
<p>Here's the vital statistics of the Gin Clear Diver, a perfectly proportioned diver targeted to fit every wrist.</p>
<ul>
<li>Case diameter: 41.5mm. 42.5mm including the coin edge bezel</li>
<li>Lug to lug length: 49mm</li>
<li>Lug opening: 22mm</li>
<li>Case thickness (excluding domed sapphire crystal): 12.3mm</li>
<li>Bracelet: 22mm tapering to 18mm at the clasp</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Movement:</strong>  you can't make a watch with the finishing and build quality of the Gin Clear Diver and pair it with anything less than the finest Swiss automatic movement available at the price point: the Sellita SW200. The SW200 is a 26 jewel high beat movement beating at a vibration rate of 28,800 bph, 4Hz that features 38 hour power reserve, seconds hacking and hand winding. With a stated accuracy of between +/-12 seconds and +/- 30 seconds per day, in real world use our prototypes were performing between +2 to +6.5 seconds per day. </p>
<p>Movement Regulation: high accuracy can only be achieved because we regulate each movement during assembly in four positions, allowing us to hone that accuracy and monitor the movement for beat rate errors which may indicate a fault and require a change of movement.</p>

<p><strong>The dials:</strong> When you want a diver that screams class as well as utility you use highly detailed, 3D embossed dials. The Gin Clear Diver comes in four standard colours (Pastel Blue, Arctic White, Cream Sand and Black Sand) and two surface textures (light sheen and sand).

Analysis of this feedback highlighted that many cyclists knees track outward at the top of the pedal stroke adding unwanted stress on the knee and splaying the power outwards on an inefficient vector relative to the pedal travel. This outward tracking is typically addressed by adjusting cleat position or/and adding spacers between the cleat and shoe to intentionally narrow the knees all the way through the pedal stroke but this over recruits the stabilizers to track the knee on a unnatural plane, good pedal action involves as straight a vertical tracking of the knees as the riders physiology permits. LIMITS allows the cyclist to ride with a stance width that is comfortable and so allows the knee to track on the most vertically linear path as possible, it stands to reason that this action will put power directly down through the pedal.</span></div>

LIMITS is designed to make cycling power meters affordable, so all cyclists can power their performance.LIMITS is available on Indiegogo from just $249 and the expected retail price will be only $384. Such a price will now make it possible for everyone to own a power meter.                                              InterchangeableEvery aspect of LIMITS is designed to give you efficiency. It is truly interchangeable and compatible with every type of bicycle. For the first time, a bicycle power meter is located between the pedal and crank arm. And for the first time you can be flexible and move LIMITS between bicycles.                             Simple to useLIMITS takes user-friendly to the next level. Thanks to its unique design, which allows it to sit between the pedal and crank arm, you simply have to pedal. This means that no replacement parts or specialised tools are required. Removal and fitting of the pedal is easily achieved with standard bike tools.
 

 
 
 
LIMITS technology features
With technology that's been designed to take your performance to the edge, LIMITS isn't just a smart power meter, it's also incredibly powerful. Not only is it designed to be efficient and easy to use, but it’s also engineered to measure your power reliably and consistently. And it comes with replaceable battery, waterproof as standard, shock resistance and temperature compensation technology so you can maximize your training efforts and performance.
                                                       
Cadence is the rate at which you pedal, measured in revolutions per minute. LIMITS uses an inclinometer to measure your cadence. The inclinometer is highly accurate (detecting rotational change of sub 1 degree), and does not require the use of additional magnets.
 
                                                       
Torque is the product of the force provided by the rider and the length of the lever-arm or crank. The LIMITS power meter measures the true force input by you to drive the bike forward. The true force is measured by precision strain gauges.
                                                       
Power is a product of cadence and torque. Power output is how much energy you are providing over time. By knowing both power and heart rate, you can accurately measure your efficiency and significantly extend your peak performance. LIMITS gives you accurate, reliable power measurements in real time, allowing you to power your performance.

<h2>What and Why</h2>
<p>I started this Brand about 8 months ago after finally getting fed up with a job I didn't enjoy, doing the same thing for 8-10 hours every day. When I started I had one goal, to pursue something I love doing and hopefully break even in the process. After the first print series went so well and was even picked up by ""The Archives"" in Ft. Lauderdale, which has become one of my favorite boutique fashions stores. I've come to realize how much I really do enjoy doing this, so I've decided to push it further. I have a passion for design and have always been a fan of clothing brands that are more limited, unique and have a story to them. Brands that want to do more than simply sell as much as possible. My goal for this brand is to become well known and established but hold fast to staying a custom, limited, and unique brand that doesnt just become another typical un-original clothing line. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Details </h2>
<p>Every last penny raised by this campaign (whether we reach the full goal or not) is going straight into purchasing product and building the brand.</p>
<p>Previously We have purchased the product before hand and then sold it from there. But this time, Since we have pushed it further by adding more designs, snapbacks, backpacks, and even higher quality print processes, costs add up which makes it harder to front the entire bill up front. </p>
<p>I have set the funding goal at $2,000 which is being put towards the following</p>
<p>4 - different shirt prints</p>
<p>1 - the 1st series of our embroidered snapback hats</p>
<p>1 - the 1st order of our custom hand made backpacks</p>
<p>When you add it all up the cost will actually be significantly more than the goal. But hey in order to pursue something you want you have to take risks and be willing to support your own ideas am I right? </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Perks!</h3>
<h3>Perk #1:</h3>
<p>Every little bit helps! For helping support the building of this brand you get the following:</p>
<p>A teddy Grahams vynal sticker to place where ever you want, car, laptop, street light etc. </p>
<p>A teddy grahams printed bottle cap! why do we have custom printed bottle caps? becuase its different and awesome of course! make a key chain, necklace, you can even recap a beer with it if you feel like it. Just another way we strive to be unique and different. </p>
<p>Sealed with our wax stamp. Packaging is everything, and this is just another way to stand out. We will seal up these goodies by hand dripping and stamping wax with our custom logo seal. </p>

I started this Brand about 8 months ago after finally getting fed up with a job I didn't enjoy, doing the same thing for 8-10 hours every day. When I started I had one goal, to pursue something I love doing and hopefully break even in the process. After the first print series went so well and was even picked up by ""The Archives"" in Ft. Lauderdale, which has become one of my favorite boutique fashions stores. I've come to realize how much I really do enjoy doing this, so I've decided to push it further. I have a passion for design and have always been a fan of clothing brands that are more limited, unique and have a story to them. Brands that want to do more than simply sell as much as possible. My goal for this brand is to become well known and established but hold fast to staying a custom, limited, and unique brand that doesnt just become another typical un-original clothing line. 
 


The Details 
Every last penny raised by this campaign (whether we reach the full goal or not) is going straight into purchasing product and building the brand.
Previously We have purchased the product before hand and then sold it from there. But this time, Since we have pushed it further by adding more designs, snapbacks, backpacks, and even higher quality print processes, costs add up which makes it harder to front the entire bill up front. 
I have set the funding goal at $2,000 which is being put towards the following
4 - different shirt prints
1 - the 1st series of our embroidered snapback hats
1 - the 1st order of our custom hand made backpacks
When you add it all up the cost will actually be significantly more than the goal. But hey in order to pursue something you want you have to take risks and be willing to support your own ideas am I right? 
 
The Perks!
Perk #1:
Every little bit helps! For helping support the building of this brand you get the following:
A teddy Grahams vynal sticker to place where ever you want, car, laptop, street light etc. 
A teddy grahams printed bottle cap! why do we have custom printed bottle caps? becuase its different and awesome of course! make a key chain, necklace, you can even recap a beer with it if you feel like it. Just another way we strive to be unique and different. 
Sealed with our wax stamp. Packaging is everything, and this is just another way to stand out. We will seal up these goodies by hand dripping and stamping wax with our custom logo seal. 
Ships within 1 week (add $3 for international orders)

<p>Just to give you a little insight about me, I am much better at expressing myself in writing, so I hope you enjoy the blooper reel. So now that we have that cleared up...</p>
<p>In 2008, I did a lot of shopping online. I lived in Stillwater, Oklahoma where I had limited access to all of the boutiques I had come to love growing up in Florida. I was searching for some fashionable eco-friendly clothing like Stella McCartney, but without the Stella McCartney price tag. I searched and searched only to find that cute eco-friendly clothing was hard to come by, let alone affordable. I started to wonder why isn't there an online boutique for women like me?  Then I thought... why don't I just create it myself? </p>
<p>I loved the idea of creating a store that reflected both my Spanish heritage and my eco-friendly point of view. I came up with verrrde. Verde in Spanish means green and the three R's represent the famous mantra, ""Reduce, Reuse, Recycle"". </p>
<p>I created <a href=""http://verrrde.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">verrrde.com</a> as a lifestyle blog and come Spring 2014 I will add e-commerce to the site that will focus on eco-friendly clothing. I have a marketing strategy and a great team which I like to call my Think Tank. Now all we need are clothes to fill the pages! With your generous contributions, we will have enough to buy our merchandise (with a focus on dresses, tops, and accessories) for the first quarter Spring 2014. </p>
<p>I have done a lot of research finding wholesalers who offer clothing using renewable resources, recycled materials, and who are also committed to making the planet a better place to live. All items sold will be under $100, making eco-friendly clothing more accessible to the everyday woman. I have been in the retail business for over 7 years and I am a master at being thrifty and fashionable.</p>
<p>As with any business, you have to account for delayed items, not getting enough inventory, having too much inventory, website kinks, and overall mayhem. I have worked in both large and small retail companies. Being an online company, we are very flexible to the demands of consumers. We will be able to reach a broader base than a stand alone brick and mortar shop plus we will be accessible 24 hours a day. Working as a stylist has made me confident in my buying/curating abilities. I also have a wonderful team who can help me with any issues from taxes to web design to social media marketing.</p>
<p>I look forward to saving you a little green while going green. I have lined up some great rewards that you will not only love but will leave your friends verrrde with envy. :) </p>
<p>A special thanks to all of those who have helped me throughout the way: David Fedele, Kara Foley, Jessica Walther, Kate and David Ahern, Dave Harrison, and Ashley Johnson for being in my Think Tank, AJ Paglia for his awesome aesthetic and logo design (find out more at <a href=""http://www.ajpaglia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ajpaglia.com</a>), Streightangular for her awesome music (find out more at <a href=""http://www.streightangular.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.streightangular.com</a>). I have been blessed with wonderful family and friends and I can't say thank you enough!</p>

With your generous contributions, we will have enough to buy our merchandise (with a focus on dresses, tops, and accessories) for the first quarter Spring 2014. 
I have done a lot of research finding wholesalers who offer clothing using renewable resources, recycled materials, and who are also committed to making the planet a better place to live. All items sold will be under $100, making eco-friendly clothing more accessible to the everyday woman. I have been in the retail business for over 7 years and I am a master at being thrifty and fashionable.
As with any business, you have to account for delayed items, not getting enough inventory, having too much inventory, website kinks, and overall mayhem. I have worked in both large and small retail companies. Being an online company, we are very flexible to the demands of consumers. We will be able to reach a broader base than a stand alone brick and mortar shop plus we will be accessible 24 hours a day. Working as a stylist has made me confident in my buying/curating abilities. I also have a wonderful team who can help me with any issues from taxes to web design to social media marketing.
I look forward to saving you a little green while going green. I have lined up some great rewards that you will not only love but will leave your friends verrrde with envy. :) 
A special thanks to all of those who have helped me throughout the way: David Fedele, Kara Foley, Jessica Walther, Kate and David Ahern, Dave Harrison, and Ashley Johnson for being in my Think Tank, AJ Paglia for his awesome aesthetic and logo design (find out more at www.ajpaglia.com), Streightangular for her awesome music (find out more at www.streightangular.com). I have been blessed with wonderful family and friends and I can't say thank you enough!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Still Foxy was born out of the idea to encourage women who have or have had breast cancer.  It began as a commemorative effort for a very dear friend’s mother who passed away from breast cancer in 2009.  We printed a few shirts using our mascot (Starla Fox) from our children’s publication, Children’s View.  Everyone loved the shirts and so began this journey.  The amount of women diagnosed with breast cancer rises every year and those same women along with those who have beat it, need encouragement somewhere along their journey.  We want to remind them in a tangible way that they are Still Foxy.  Now we understand the huge financial strain breast cancer can create so that is why FOXY FORWARD was created.  The idea is simple; fund an item or items through IndieGoGo for someone you know or don’t know who is currently going through or has gone through breast cancer, or for you.  Our goal is to encourage women around the world with two words, Still Foxy.  A percentage of the proceeds from this project go to breast cancer research, so we can eventually beat this disease.

 
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET

A million dollars, we know that is the question you are asking and why, more importantly?  It is simple, it is estimated that 226,870 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 according to the American Cancer Society.  If you funded a bracelet for $5 X 226,870=$1,134,350.  Our goal is that you help us encourage the same amount of women as it is estimated to be diagnosed this year.  Told you it was simple.  Funding will go towards expanding our product line, ordering a screen printer, and ordering an embroidery machine.  We also have to save 25% for taxes as this is considered income.  We have ideas to expand into scrubs, pajamas, under garments, and hosting Still Foxy events (such as a motorcycle ride and tennis tournament to name a few).  The ideas are limitless and we want to be able to encourage as many women on as many different levels in as many different areas as we can. We just need to get the ball rolling.

 
It gets more exciting as the perks go:
 
Perk 1: Foxy Forward a Bracelet $5
We have two versions of this unisex bracelet (tell us which one you like best, by your funding).  The first bracelet (pictured) has our mascot Starla on one side and the words Still Foxy on the opposite side.  The other looks the same with the words Still on one side of Starla and Foxy on the other side.  They are a great conversation piece and reminder that you are Still Foxy.  
 
Perk 2: Foxy Forward a Hat $20
Not everyone wears hats, but there are some hat lovers out there and this is for you.  This adjustable unisex head piece has the words Still Foxy embroidered in pink across the top and comes in khaki, pink, and white.  A nice accessory to a relaxing day outside and oh yeah it helps keep the sun out of your face.
 
Perk 3: Foxy Forward a T-shirt $30
This is what started our journey of encouragement.  The Still Foxy t-shirt is a cotton shirt with your choice of logos.  You can pick from the Big Ribbon logo with Starla’s head in the center or the Silhouette logo with Still Foxy on the sides.  The shirts come in Ladies and Junior sizes, so please be specific and they range from S-XL.  Tell everyone how you feel without saying a word, Still Foxy!
 
Perk 4:  Foxy Forward a T and Hat Combo $45
We know some of you want it all, so get the shirt and hat and we’ll add a bracelet of your choice. 2 out 3 is good, but 3 out of 3 is better.
 
Perk 5:  Foxy Forward a group of 5 $225
This is where encouragement goes to another level.  Know of a breast cancer support group in your area, send them this encouragement pack?  It includes 5 shirts, 5 hats and 5 bracelets.  If you don’t know of any, we’ll gladly send it to one in your name and forward the information to you.
 
Perk 6:  Foxy Forward a group 10 $450
This is the same as perk 5 times 2.  You’ll receive or send 10 shirts, 10 hats, and 10 bracelets.
 
All items include shipping in the United States.  An additional $10-$25 will be added for international shipping.
 
IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL
Now if we don’t reach our target goal, we’ll still be able to encourage the women you’ve made a part of the Still Foxy family.  Also, we’ll focus on what you; our funders want to see next.
 
OTHER WAYS TO HELP
Like we stated earlier, we understand the enormous costs associated with breast cancer, so if you are unable to contribute we understand.  Spreading the word about Foxy Forward is just as valuable, because you know somebody that we don’t.  Help us out by using the IndieGoGo share tools or give someone a call (the old fashion way) and tell them about.  Thanks so much.
 
THANK YOU’S
Thanks to everyone for all of your support every step of the way
Our models:  Tameika, Ambrosia, Rashekia, and Sara

<p>For years we have used headlamps to light our adventures, work, and projects.  Unfortunately every traditional headlamp has one common problem - tunnel vision or a narrow beam of visibility.  The ONE80 solves that problem by eliminating the possibility of tunnel vision.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>The ONE80 solves tunnel vision by providing enough light to simulate daylight.  The 180 degree light allows you to naturally use your eyes the  way you use them during the day, with your peripheries. This eliminates the need to precariously turn your head to see, and opens you to a full peripheral perspective in the dark. </p>

<p>Strong, clean and clear peripheral sight. Most headlamps have 1 or 2 LEDs. If they’re 
super powerful you may see 4 or 5. The ONE8Ø Lights’ 20 LEDs wrap the front half of 
your head or waist to ensure you don’t lose any of your peripheral vision. You can rely on the natural movement of your eyes to see and experience everything around you.</p>

<p> Whether you’re running up a trail through the trees or rappelling down a canyon wall the ONE8Ø Light will give a steady and even light source.

<p>New possibilities open up with interchangeable parts. Quickly and easily trade out with a backup battery. Remove the LED illumination band and the battery pack from your Halo or Trek and light up your tent. Regardless of how you use your ONE8Ø Light, it will likely get dirty. Simply remove the illumination band and battery pack to machine or hand wash your headband and/or belt.</p>

ONE8Ø Halo Headlamp





ONE8Ø Trek Beltlamp 





For years we have used headlamps to light our adventures, work, and projects.  Unfortunately every traditional headlamp has one common problem - tunnel vision or a narrow beam of visibility.  The ONE80 solves that problem by eliminating the possibility of tunnel vision.










The ONE80 solves tunnel vision by providing enough light to simulate daylight.  The 180 degree light allows you to naturally use your eyes the  way you use them during the day, with your peripheries. This eliminates the need to precariously turn your head to see, and opens you to a full peripheral perspective in the dark. 





Headlamp Comparison





Check out a first hand view of what it's like to hike with a ONE8Ø Light. Rusty and Ammon hiking though the Nevada desert with a GoPro on a chesty mount. 





Strong, clean and clear peripheral sight. Most headlamps have 1 or 2 LEDs. If they’re 
super powerful you may see 4 or 5. The ONE8Ø Lights’ 20 LEDs wrap the front half of 
your head or waist to ensure you don’t lose any of your peripheral vision. You can rely on the natural movement of your eyes to see and experience everything around you.










 Whether you’re running up a trail through the trees or rappelling down a canyon wall the ONE8Ø Light will give a steady and even light source. You no longer have to worry about the bouncing beam of light that jolts around and shakes with every head and body movement. Experience steady Illumination no matter how active you are.  










New possibilities open up with interchangeable parts. Quickly and easily trade out with a backup battery. Remove the LED illumination band and the battery pack from your Halo or Trek and light up your tent. Regardless of how you use your ONE8Ø Light, it will likely get dirty. Simply remove the illumination band and battery pack to machine or hand wash your headband and/or belt.










Quick and convenient, the micro USB charging cable makes the ONE80 ready when you are.  Recharge the battery with an outlet, your computer or solar panel. Each 1800mA battery pack gives you 3hrs of battery life.  










The ONE8Ø Light fits comfortably to the contour of your head and waist. There are no protruding plastic pieces or parts that stick out from your body. The lightweight and flexible fit makes wearing it hardly noticeable. 










 At only 3.3 oz you’ll forget you’re wearing anything. Even the battery packs are extremely light weight. Pack along a few extras at only 1.5 oz each. Built and designed for an active, minimalist lifestyle. 















Unlike a AA or AAA battery powered light that begins dim shortly after turning on, the ONE8Ø lithium battery pack gives you the same constant power from full charge to no charge.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our choice of movement was a careful process of comparison between several cost-efficient, skeletonised calibres. We wanted to make watches that last for decades, so the durable and highly reliable Miyota/Citizen 8N24 became our choice. Beating at 21,600 VPH, the movement gives the watch a smooth sweep, yet retains the longevity advantages of lower-beat movements. With Parashock technology and an indirect drive shock-resistant gear train, this tiny movement is surprisingly shock resistant – yet at the same time with its skeletonised frame, it looks fantastic whether you want to admire it through an open heart or through the see-through case back we include as a standard.</span></p>

<h3 style=""font-weight: 300;"">FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Can anything be marked on the dial?</strong></p>
<p>A: As long as it doesn’t infringe other’s copyright.</p> <p><strong>Q: How fine can the signature or logo be marked?</strong></p>
<p>A: The finest line we can do is as thin as 0.05mm. To achieve the best result,  we recommend the picture you provided should be  1800px x 1800px resolution.</p> <p><strong>Q: Can we mark different color on the dial?</strong></p>
<p>A. At the moment no as we weren’t satisfied with the level of finish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I engrave the image without marking color on the dial or text cut-outs? </strong></p>
<p>A: Unfortunately, no. Pinot Blanc and Navigator only offers color marking on dial. This is our preferred method of customisation as it can personalised at a much higher resolution. If you would like to have our previous model Pinot Noir which includes the mentioned features, please contact us at <a href=""mailto:contact@eoniq.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact@eoniq.co</a> . FYI, the Pinot Noir is a pricier option and takes longer to craft.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I customize a watch?</strong></p>
<p>A: After backing, we will send you an access code for designing your watch 6 weeks before you will receive it. On our design app, you will be able to select the watch components, design the watch face, upload your own designs and graphics, from signatures to personal logos. With professionally designed templates and endless combination possibilities, you’ll be able to tell your own stories with a bespoke, timeless watch that is as unique as you are.</p> <p><strong>Q: Do you guys ship outside USA?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, we ship globally.</p> <p><strong>Q: What are the shipping costs?</strong></p>
<p>A: Global shipping costs USD20 to anywhere in the world with the exception of Hong Kong, where delivery is free.</p> <p><strong>Q: Can I get it before Christmas?</strong></p>
<p>A: Day 1 Only Perk - Yes.</p>
<p>If you back us with Super Early Bird or Indiegogo Special Perks, you will get your watch before Valentine’s day.</p> <p><strong>Q: Do I need to pay any tax?</strong></p>
<p>A: Some countries outside Hong Kong may require import tax, duties and related Customs fees for imports, and these costs are <strong>NOT</strong> covered by payments made to us. These charges, if applicable, are determined and charged by the Customs office of the destination country. For further details of charges, please contact your local Customs office.</p> <p><strong>Q: How long is the warranty and what does it cover?</strong></p>
<p>A: We offer 24-months warranty for our custom bespoke pieces. The warranty covers defective watches from the date of shipment. Should the watch stop working on its own, we will make you a new one. Simply contact us at <a href=""mailto:contact@eoniq.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact@eoniq.co</a> and we'll walk you through the process. We are not responsible for any accidental damage to the watch. We will refund warranty related shipping fees to the customer after we have clarified that the problem with your watch falls under warranty. However, please note that all return/warranty packages remain the responsibility of the customer until received by us. We therefore advise you to take the necessary precautions to ship your watch safely by using registered traceable services and appropriate packaging for all watch shipments.</p> <p><strong>Q: Can I return my watch after I receive it?</strong></p>
<p>A: Each of the watches we make are made to order and produced just for you. That means once the watch is produced, it will be extremely challenging for us to re-purpose it should you decide that you do not want it. Therefore we will not be able to accept returns unless the watch was defective when shipped.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Will it fit my wrist?</strong></p>
<p>A: Wrist circumference of our straps:</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Does it need batteries?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, mechanical watches are powered by the movement’s mechanical parts. The movement is fitted with an oscillating weight called therotor – meaning that the watch automatically winds and powers itself from the owner’s natural wrist movement. When the power reserve left in the watch runs down due to the watch not being worn, the watch stops running and needs to be re-set before wearing again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: How long will the watch run for? How much power can the watch reserve?</strong></p>
<p>A: 40 hours or more across all models.</p> <p><strong>Q: Is there any maintenance required for the watch?</strong></p>
<p>A: For automatic mechanical watches, you should wind it at least once a week, though regular wear is often enough to maintain it. For hand-wound, manual watches, you should wind it daily Try to avoid letting any mechanical watch sit inactive for more than a month. Minimal maintenance is needed for mechanical watches, but we recommend having the watch serviced every 5-10 years by a qualified watchmaker.</p> <p><strong>Q: Can EONIQ service my watch?</strong></p>

For advanced users: uploading a complete design of your own or modifying font, number sizes and more!

 
Step 2: We hand craft your watch. Each by 1 dedicated watch maker
Yes. One watch maker per watch. We believe this is the only way to respect true watch making craftmanship, and to convey your unique story.


 
Step 3: Some will get your watches by Christmas! The others will get them shortly after.
We don't mass produce any of our watches so it will take time and effort for each and every watch. We will do our best to complete everyone's custom watches as soon as possible.

 


Our watches are one of the very few offering in the market where you can add your own signature, and still have a great looking watch. We have intentionally designed our watch face so everything will look refined along with your personalization.

<b>The reason this campaign is so important and personal to me is because I once had a brother that was a bike rider. He had his motorcycle for 1 week before his fatal accident.

<h3><strong>Supporting LGBTQ Organization</strong></h3>
<p>If we reach our full goal, we'll be donating a portion of the campaign funds to Lyric (a San Francisco based LGBTQQ youth empowerment program), San Francisco's The Center, and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC).</p>

<p>As a member of the LGBTQ community, it's been impossible to sit by idly while the debate over the Supreme Court's upcoming judgement on Prop 8 and DOMA pulses through our country. After signing dozens of petitions, my partner and I wanted to join the movement in a more creative and personal way and help others do the same.

<p>We've started the Indiegogo campaign to help us produce and distribute the shirts to those who want to add their voice to the movement. Join us in spreading popular support for LGBTQ marriage equality. Purchase a JUDGE ME shirt, put a face to the discrimination being debated and start an honest conversation about this issue with someone in your community.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds from the Indiegogo campaign will go towards producing our first bulk run of the shirt. Our goal is based on a 200 shirt run, which would drive the cost per shirt down to a reasonable price, allowing us to donate to LGBTQ advocacy organizations and invest time in distributing them at LGBTQ outlets and events throughout the next few months.</p>
<p><strong>The Shirt</strong></p>
<p>The JUDGE ME t-shirt will be printed on black American Apparel brand t-shirts.  The foreground shows JUDGE ME in white letters with “DOMA/Prop 8 – Supreme Court 2013” printed in smaller lettering underneath.  The background text, printed in gray, includes gay and lesbian slurs in English and other languages from all over the world.  Your shirts can be picked up at the San Francisco distribution party or delivered to you at your home.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Sale Perk</strong></p>
<p>We have a limited number of ""pre-sale"" shirts for early supporters that are just a bit cheaper. We'll also be sure to send those shirts out first.</p>
<p><strong>San Francisco Distribution Party Perk</strong> </p>
<p>Live in San Francisco? Want to pick up your shirt and party with us? Buy this perk and the extra $5 will go towards getting a DJ and working with a venue for some excellent drink specials. Date and time TBD, but we'll keep you posted and give you plenty of advance notice. </p>

<h1>Developing Chapplicator</h1></span></figure>I created Chapplicator for lip balm users, like myself. If you use lip balm, you know it’s a challenge to apply it consistently. The tiny tubes are constantly disappearing, and it never seems to be accessible when you need it. Enter Chapplicator. With Chapplicator, you always know where your lip balm is, and you can quickly and easily apply it, with just one hand, and without that annoying little cap.</figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">I originally developed Chapplicator for snowsports. I learned to ski in 2009 and quickly fell in love with the sport. But the cold and dry air caused some serious chapped lips, and applying lip balm while on the slopes was a huge hassle. If you keep lip balm in the pocket of your ski jacket, it’s impossible to remove and apply it without taking off a glove, and using two hands.  I knew there had to be a better way, so I started working on a solution.</figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><span>At first, I had a lot of crazy ideas. But I quickly recognized that the solution needed to be a simple, stand-alone device that could hold any kind of lip balm. Drawing from my experience of having a GoPro camera mounted to my helmet, I decided that the side of my helmet was the perfect place for a lip balm holder. That way, I could just reach up, pull it off, apply, and put it back.</span></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><span><br/></span></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">Once I had the general concept, I needed to create prototypes. The very first prototype was made with Play-Doh. I took my molded model to a local industrial designer, and he and I worked together to create a CAD model of the device. We then created working prototypes using 3D-printing, slowly improving the function with each version. Finally, I took the model to a product development company who refined the design and is currently heading up the manufacturing process.</figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><span>With manufacturing quotes in-hand, I am coming to Indiegogo so that I can share Chapplicator with everyone!</span></figure><br/><p></p>

We apologize for the inconvenience that this has caused, and are very grateful to those who supported Chapplicator.Despite this setback, we have every intent to bring Chapplicator to market. We believe it is an awesome and innovative product, and are excited to see it on ski helmets, jackets, bikes, and cars in the very near future. Rest assured, this is not the end of Chapplicator.  Thank you again to all of our contributors!Chapplicator holds any type of tube lip balm and gives you quick access wherever you are.Launch ColorsChoose from Black or Grey with a Black, White, or Pink Accent Arrow.




Picking Colors and Mounts
We will send an email to all contributors half way through our campaign so you can choose your colors and your mount.  We have set a stretch goal of $35,000!  If we raise $35,000, we will expand the color options from 6 to 18.  
WE WILL EMAIL ALL CONTRIBUTORS FOR COLOR AND MOUNT SELECTION.  Snow · Bike · Car · and More
Where to use Chapplicator · Choose Your Mount 
Chapplicator started out as a snow accessory, but we designed additional applications for snow jackets, biking, and the car visor.  You can choose one of five types of Chapplicator.Choose From:
Helmet Mount with 3M Tape
Jacket Clip
Car Visor Clip
Bike Clip
Anywhere - Flat Mount with 3M Tape




Developing ChapplicatorI created Chapplicator for lip balm users, like myself. If you use lip balm, you know it’s a challenge to apply it consistently. The tiny tubes are constantly disappearing, and it never seems to be accessible when you need it. Enter Chapplicator. With Chapplicator, you always know where your lip balm is, and you can quickly and easily apply it, with just one hand, and without that annoying little cap.I originally developed Chapplicator for snowsports. I learned to ski in 2009 and quickly fell in love with the sport. But the cold and dry air caused some serious chapped lips, and applying lip balm while on the slopes was a huge hassle. If you keep lip balm in the pocket of your ski jacket, it’s impossible to remove and apply it without taking off a glove, and using two hands.  I knew there had to be a better way, so I started working on a solution.At first, I had a lot of crazy ideas. But I quickly recognized that the solution needed to be a simple, stand-alone device that could hold any kind of lip balm. Drawing from my experience of having a GoPro camera mounted to my helmet, I decided that the side of my helmet was the perfect place for a lip balm holder. That way, I could just reach up, pull it off, apply, and put it back.Once I had the general concept, I needed to create prototypes. The very first prototype was made with Play-Doh. I took my molded model to a local industrial designer, and he and I worked together to create a CAD model of the device. We then created working prototypes using 3D-printing, slowly improving the function with each version. Finally, I took the model to a product development company who refined the design and is currently heading up the manufacturing process.With manufacturing quotes in-hand, I am coming to Indiegogo so that I can share Chapplicator with everyone!",10.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>My name is Hugh Quattlebaum and I'm a former professional baseball player who has spent the last ten years coaching players from middle school through college.  Throughout those years, I've been searching for a better way to help my kids get stronger and stay healthier so they can accelerate the improvement of everything we do on the field.  When I try to help parents and coaches pick the best off-field conditioning programs, I always run into the same problems...</p>
<p><b>1.  COST</b></p>
<p>COMMON COSTS FOR SERIOUS ATHLETES TO STAY IN SHAPE:</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Personal training = $50-100 per session<br/>Gym Membership = $500-$1500 per year<br/>Velocity Performance Training = $1000-3000 per year at 2-4 visits per week</p>
<p><i>SportSWAT = $99.99 annual</i></p>
<p><b>2. TIME</b></p>
<p>Middle school, high school and college athletes don't have the time to train outside the home as many times per week as they should.  Juggling team practices and homework is hard enough, so finding time to go to a gym or drive to personal training sessions is hard.</p>
<p><i>SportSWAT = Done at home with minimal equipment in under 40 minutes.</i></p>
<p><b>3. SPORT-SPECIFIC TRAINING</b></p>
<p>It is very difficult to find facilities or trainers who specialize in targeting the muscles you need to improve and keep healthy for one specific sport.</p>
<p><i>SportSWAT = Sport Specific Workouts And Training.</i></p>
<p>The first installment of the Sport-SWAT program will be for BASEBALL (B-SWAT, BASEBALL SPECIFIC WORKOUTS AND TRAINING) and we want to show how valuable it is for baseball players so we can ultimately bring the idea of online, sport-specific training to ALL SPORTS.   Sport-SWAT is a digital training program designed to bring the most affordable and comprehensive sport-specific workouts into your home in under 40 minutes a day.  This will allow the student athlete to take less time out of his or her day while working out more frequently and more effectively than ever.  They can just log on, and get better.</p>
<p>The B-SWAT program targets all five tools that coaches and scouts look for, with workouts designed specifically to improve <b>hitting,</b> <b>hitting for power</b>, <b>arm strength</b>, <b>defense</b>, and <b>speed</b>. Also, because so many young players are specializing in just baseball, we've added the tool of <b>health</b> and designed workouts to REDUCE THE RISK OF INJURY and combat potential over-use while targeting the muscles we often forget <b>so we stay on the field</b>...because as the old saying goes ""you can't make a club in the tub!""</p>
<p>We've consulted and trained with dozens of physical therapists, doctors, specialists, personal trainers, and MLB strength-and-conditioning coaches in creating the B-SWAT program.  It has been tested by current Major Leaguers and has been vetted for health and safety by Dr. Frank Amato of DABCO and The Center for Orthopedic and Athletic Injuries. </p>
<p>The SportSWAT team is also proud to announce their partnership with ProAngle Media as the production team behind the videos.</p>

<p>FITNESS ACCOUNTABILITY...</p>
<p>""That all sounds great, and I'd love to buy that for my kid, but I don't want to force him to do it if (s)he's not motivated.""</p>
<p>We've already created the B-SWAT workout, but we all know that getting your butt to actually work out requires motivation.  Providing a new technological environment where coaches can track their players' progress, so they can establish accountability and motivation for their team, is the future of training.</p>
<p><i>- Coaches will be able to track their players' workouts and progress and motivate them to improve.</i></p>
<p><i>- Teams will have online profiles and improvement scores so they can see where they stack up nationally and fuel each other to raise the team score to win big team prizes.</i></p>
<p><i>- Individuals can see where they stack up against other players on their team and with other users from around the world and compete for individual rewards.</i></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>SportSWAT will provide the most cost-effective and cutting edge training to improve play on the field while maintaining health, but we need funding for web development to create the technology that can support the means for coaches and parents to help drive their athletes to take pride in their strength and conditioning gains. We can stir that competitive gene with the right technology that helps coaches create an accountability standard for their players, and we firmly believe we can generate a new culture of young athletes that compete as hard off the field as they do on the field, staying healthier as a result.</p>
<p>The success of at-home workout programs - like P90X and Insanity under the Beachbodies Inc. umbrella - shows the value of being able to work out at home, but those workouts are for the weight loss generation.  SportSWAT has a new target.  We want to strengthen 14-24 year-old athletes that can be highly motivated by their desire to improve their athletic performance and minimize their risk of injury.</p>

<p>We are Stefan and Marc, both born in 1970 which means we grew up the 70’s, a time when technology was rapidly changing and a decade where self-expression and individuality were hallmarks of the time.</p>
<p>Our first design, the <i><strong>Robusto</strong></i>, has an <strong>awesome retro style</strong> and strong aesthetic influences from the decade of our childhood.</p>
<p>An era where <strong>high-tech futurism</strong> and radical<strong> experimentation with form</strong> were a reaction against the sleek mid-century modernism. The architects had exuberant spirits; they reveled in form, function, and funkiness. and <strong>watches had fantastic and futuristic designs that got you noticed</strong>.</p>
<p>We were looking for a <strong>high quality timepiece</strong> that would withstand, not only, the test of time but also the burden of daily wear and tear. A timepiece that is engineered to the <strong>highest specifications</strong>, build with the <strong>best materials</strong> and designed to be <strong>robust yet elegant</strong>. We didn’t find what we were looking for, and what we found we couldn’t afford… Designing and engineering our own watch was the only way to follow and so the TiMe22 story started. </p>

<h3>Only the best materials and components</h3>
<p>The Robusto <strong>Ti5 Titanium</strong> watch is made of the same material as jet engines and other aerospace components, titanium is 45% lighter than steel and anti-corrosive.</p>
<p>Most titanium watches are made from commercially pure titanium (<i>grade-2  or Ti2 titanium</i>). For us this material just isn't strong enough and most high quality watchmakers feel the same. </p>
<p>The titanium alloy used for TiMe22 bracelets and cases is one of <strong>the strongest alloys available</strong>. Grade-5 or <strong>Ti5 titanium</strong>, also known as <i>Ti-6Al-4V</i>, is obtained by a smelting process where pure titanium is alloyed with small amounts of aluminium and vanadium. The result is a metal that is <strong>significantly stronge</strong>r and <strong>far more scratch-resistant</strong> than pure titanium or even stainless steel. </p>
<p><i>Ti5 titanium is anti-magnetic, hypoallergenic and particularly resistant to corrosion by acids found in the sea and in perspiration.</i></p>
<p>Inside the <strong>brushed Ti5 titanium</strong> 45mm case you’ll find a <strong>Swiss made ETA movement</strong>, water resistant down to 200 meters, featuring <strong>sapphire crystal </strong>and Swiss Super-Luminova® lumed dial and hands.</p>

<p>We have made two different variations of the Robusto:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Robusto Precision</strong> (battery operated)</li>
<li>
<strong>Robusto Automatic </strong>(self-winding)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both variations come with the same Ti5 titanium case and bracelet, the distinction is the movement.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Robusto Precision</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475837929/yxpx2wlnfiqu26gkwxa7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Robusto Precision features the <strong>Swiss made</strong> ETA Normflatline 955.112 <strong>battery operated </strong>movement with 7 jewels and battery End-of-Life display.</p>
<p>This movement is popular and widely used (<i>most Tag Heuer battery operated watches use this movement</i>). It is also one of the <strong>most reliable quartz movements</strong> you can get on the market today.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Robusto Automatic</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475838002/ncxbm2ndwoib2nfadm6d.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Robusto Automatic features the <strong>Swiss made</strong> ETA Mecaline 2824-2 <strong>Self-winding </strong>movement with 25 Jewels, 28.800 vibrations per hour and ETACHRON regulator system.</p>
<p>This movement is one of the best known and most widely used mechanical movements at all. It is considered to be <strong>accurate</strong>, <strong>robust </strong>and <strong>reliable </strong>and can be found in Tudors, Breitlings, Tag Heuers and many other brands.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which movement should I choose?</h3>
<p>When compared both movements have their advantages and dis-advantages. The first that comes to mind is that the <strong>Robusto Precision is more economically priced</strong> and the <strong>Robusto Automatic is more technically advanced</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475838097/rhk39hw7equswmxg7pa1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Choose from 4 dial colors</h3>
<p>You will have a chance to choose from the following <strong>four dial colors</strong> before we produce your watch. Please note that all options will be available on the Robusto Automatic as well as the Robusto Precision. In direct light/sunlight there is a sparkle in both colours.</p>

<p><strong>Quality control</strong> is carried out at every step during the watch assembly process. Each watchmaker is expected to verify the work of the previous watchmaker handling the piece and verify whether it <strong>conforms to TiMe22's strict quality standards</strong>.</p>
<p>Should a problem arise at any point in the assembly line, the watch is sent back to the start of the production line to be disassembled, and the process starts all over again.  </p>
<p><strong>We stand firmly behind our products and are committed to fanatical service.</strong> Each TiMe22 watch comes with a <strong>limited lifetime warranty</strong> of flaws in workmanship and materials.</p>

</div></div>","We are Stefan and Marc, both born in 1970 which means we grew up the 70’s, a time when technology was rapidly changing and a decade where self-expression and individuality were hallmarks of the time.
Our first design, the Robusto, has an awesome retro style and strong aesthetic influences from the decade of our childhood.
An era where high-tech futurism and radical experimentation with form were a reaction against the sleek mid-century modernism. The architects had exuberant spirits; they reveled in form, function, and funkiness. and watches had fantastic and futuristic designs that got you noticed.
We were looking for a high quality timepiece that would withstand, not only, the test of time but also the burden of daily wear and tear. A timepiece that is engineered to the highest specifications, build with the best materials and designed to be robust yet elegant. We didn’t find what we were looking for, and what we found we couldn’t afford… Designing and engineering our own watch was the only way to follow and so the TiMe22 story started. 
 
Don't keep Robusto a secret..
30 seconds of your time could make the difference in growing the TiMe22 Robusto community. Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who loves watches!
 

 

 

 

 
    
    Creating something is fun. Especially if you get to design something that you are passionate about. We believe that design is an integral part of product development. Designers are included in the earliest phases of innovative processes and the production development cycle. We also believe that there is always a better way to solve a problem and that is why we never stop trying to make great ideas better. Lastly, we believe that people who use and love our watches deserve a lifetime guarantee. Stefan Wessels and Marc Schot with the TiMe22 Robusto 
 
Only the best materials and components
The Robusto Ti5 Titanium watch is made of the same material as jet engines and other aerospace components, titanium is 45% lighter than steel and anti-corrosive.
Most titanium watches are made from commercially pure titanium (grade-2  or Ti2 titanium). For us this material just isn't strong enough and most high quality watchmakers feel the same. 
The titanium alloy used for TiMe22 bracelets and cases is one of the strongest alloys available. Grade-5 or Ti5 titanium, also known as Ti-6Al-4V, is obtained by a smelting process where pure titanium is alloyed with small amounts of aluminium and vanadium. The result is a metal that is significantly stronger and far more scratch-resistant than pure titanium or even stainless steel. 
Ti5 titanium is anti-magnetic, hypoallergenic and particularly resistant to corrosion by acids found in the sea and in perspiration.
Inside the brushed Ti5 titanium 45mm case you’ll find a Swiss made ETA movement, water resistant down to 200 meters, featuring sapphire crystal and Swiss Super-Luminova® lumed dial and hands.









 
 

All our watches are hand-assembled and come with a lifetime warranty. The Robusto is waterresistant up to 20ATM / 200m / 660 ft (you can wear it when scuba-diving without any worries). 
Each watch has an Individual Serial String with authenticity method.
 

 
Features


The case and bracelet are made in scratch resistant and very hard grade 5 titanium and have a brushed surface finish. 
The bracelet is constructed from single-piece chains which we have designed for the Robusto. 
The hidden clasp is made in stainless steel. It folds like a butterfly and opens with a double push button. 
Robusto Precision features a Swiss made ETA Normflatline 955.112 battery operated movement with 7 jewels and battery End-of-Life display. 
Robusto Automatic features a Swiss made ETA Mecaline 2824-2 self-winding movement with 25 Jewels, 28.800 vibrations per hour and ETACHRON regulator system. 
The screwed down crown has the atomic number from titanium, 22, engraved in the center. 
The hands and hour-markers are coated with Swiss Super-Luminova® BGW9. This makes them luminescent (glow-in-the-dark) and easy to read. 
The Sapphire crystal is treated with an anti-reflective coating on the inside.
The dial is made from bronze and painted in colour. In direct sunlight the dial has a sparkle.


 

Dimensions
The Case has a diameter (width) of 45mm, creating a large bezel around the 29.50mm crystal. At the lugs (where the bracelet connects) the Robusto measures 28mm. The case is only 10mm thick (height). The bracelet is 24mm wide and the watch weighs under 130gr.
 
 

We have made two different variations of the Robusto:


Robusto Precision (battery operated)

Robusto Automatic (self-winding)

Both variations come with the same Ti5 titanium case and bracelet, the distinction is the movement.
 
Robusto Precision

The Robusto Precision features the Swiss made ETA Normflatline 955.112 battery operated movement with 7 jewels and battery End-of-Life display.
This movement is popular and widely used (most Tag Heuer battery operated watches use this movement). It is also one of the most reliable quartz movements you can get on the market today.
 
Robusto Automatic

The Robusto Automatic features the Swiss made ETA Mecaline 2824-2 Self-winding movement with 25 Jewels, 28.800 vibrations per hour and ETACHRON regulator system.
This movement is one of the best known and most widely used mechanical movements at all. It is considered to be accurate, robust and reliable and can be found in Tudors, Breitlings, Tag Heuers and many other brands.
 
Which movement should I choose?
When compared both movements have their advantages and dis-advantages. The first that comes to mind is that the Robusto Precision is more economically priced and the Robusto Automatic is more technically advanced.

 
 
Choose from 4 dial colors
You will have a chance to choose from the following four dial colors before we produce your watch. Please note that all options will be available on the Robusto Automatic as well as the Robusto Precision. In direct light/sunlight there is a sparkle in both colours.



Mocha: The Mocha features a Pantone 411PC painted bronze dial. 

Royal Blue: The Royal Blue feautures a Pantone 281PC painted bronze dial.

Imperial Red: The Imperial Red features a Pantone 1797PC painted bronze dial.
Lunar Black: The Lunar Black features a Pantone 412PC painted bronze dial.



 

Your Robusto watch will come in a presentation box. Take a quick look at our unboxing video:

 
 

We offer FREE shipping for the Robusto. As an international customer, we’d like to make sure that you are aware that prices billed for goods shipped outside the European Union do not include any taxes, duties, VAT or other charges due to the recipient’s local or national government authority. These other charges, duties and taxes (including VAT) are the sole responsibility of the recipient and must be paid upon arrival in the destination country. Usually these fees are demanded prior to delivery and are collected by the shipping courier or local customs authority.
For more details please contact your local customs office. You may also use a Duty Calculator to calculate what you may be charged by your local government.
 
 

Quality control is carried out at every step during the watch assembly process. Each watchmaker is expected to verify the work of the previous watchmaker handling the piece and verify whether it conforms to TiMe22's strict quality standards.
Should a problem arise at any point in the assembly line, the watch is sent back to the start of the production line to be disassembled, and the process starts all over again.  
We stand firmly behind our products and are committed to fanatical service. Each TiMe22 watch comes with a limited lifetime warranty of flaws in workmanship and materials.

We found the current solutions just weren't user friendly and of poor quality. So we set out to design a case specifically for your car key.

Now we have a product that not only keeps your keys safe from hackers, it prevents damage, keeps things together, has free personalisation and will instantly upgrade any car key.  Here’s what you could do: keep your key in a metal box (some recommend the fridge), wrap it in aluminium foil, settle for a cheap pouch from who-knows-where, and that’s fine. But we don’t want ‘fine’, we want ‘good’. What about the more stylised items on the market? Mass-manufactured car key pouches with four button holes for a three-button fob, garish stitching and cheap materials that barely hold together. You wouldn’t buy a car that barely held together. Or shoes. Or windows. You lock your house door at night, not just roll a boulder in front of it. This is an elegant solution to an increasing problem.So here’s what you should do: invest in KeyBlock. It looks good and it works. Bingpot. Car AccessUnlocking your car at a distance is a convenience we don’t want to deprive you of. KeyBlock is easy to use single-handed, leaving your other hand free to carry the shopping, open the door for your partner or keep your child close. We opted for a one-handed use magnetic closure which allows you to access all of the lock/unlock buttons without removing the key from the holder. This proved to be a great choice for keyless start cars that still required entry through a manual click of the fob. Carbon leatherWhy settle for some plastic or polyurethane cover? We have the actual leathers used in Aston Martin and Tesla models to cover your keys. You don’t compromise on security, so why compromise on looks?Unrivaled in it’s wear-resistance, the leathers we have are used in high-end cars and by the Ministry of Defence. They don’t skimp on quality and neither do we.Composite construction for maximum signal blocking Modern security has many layers: doors, locks, alarms, sensors, so it only makes sense that so does KeyBlock: multi-layered RFID shielding within a modern polymer housing, wrapped in wear-resistant leather. Security that doesn’t sacrifice style.Keyless IgnitionFor keyless ignition simply open the magnetic closure for the car to recognise your key. The single-handed operation makes it a dream to use, so you can get on the road quickly and easily.     Magnetic ClosureButtons are nice, but magnets are better! We wanted to create a seamless look on the front and the redesign allowed us to do away with the button and make it a magnetic closure. This was part of our mission to make it easy to open and close one-handed. Split ringBut what about your other keys, the ones that can’t be scanned (as easily, anyway)? A built-in split ring allows you the option of keeping all your keys together. Stands up for youWe wanted this to look great even when on the side board in your house, so we designed it to stand wherever it was placed, keeping your keybowl organised. PersonalisedIt already looks the business but it needs something else. How about free personalisation? Put your name on it, phone number, a message or a date. Whatever you like. Probably avoid your registration though. Gives the game away too easy.  Mint conditionNow you can keep the key in as good condition as the day you bought it, all while keeping it safe. Ultra-lightweightAnybody who says ‘just put it in a box’ clearly doesn’t know what it’s like to carry a metal box around in their pocket all day. And have you seen what a tin can do to jeans? It’ll wear through a pocket like a lightsabre through a youngling. Pocket sized KeyBlock is sized to fit neatly in any pocket, whether suit, trouser or otter.   We genuinely love to hear your thoughts and field your questions, so get in touch.  If your key is something that we have not come across before and is bigger than the internal sizes, we want to hear from you! Let us know the dimensions of your key and we can get to work on a larger size! RFID Signal Test We've tested many forms of KeyBlock to make sure your keys are protected, using faraday key pouches, boxes and a whole variety of signal blocking materials until we settled on this design. We have also ensured Keyblock, blocks all signals from any manufactured car. Testing of the materials also went far and beyond cars, as this is the same materials we use in a majority of our wallets we can say for sure that it also blocks rfid, radio and mobile phone signals.   The originalThe original Carbon wallet was a big hit among professionals around the world, so we’ve brought that same game-changing look and feel to the automotive world. Now you can upgrade your car key, not just protect it. Hand-assembled in the UKEverything that goes into this design is sourced from UK companies and then put together here in the UK by skilled craftspeople. No middlemen, no chief financial officer forcing us to cut corners to pump up profits. Just a desire to make the best car key signal blocking case we can. Backed by youThis isn’t our idea, it’s yours. Over the years, we’ve had repeated calls for something like this and now the time is right to do it. It’s not about blasting ‘Vanacci’ wherever you go: this is yours to have, use and enjoy. This is why we have only  discreetly branded the base of KeyBlock with our logo.Who we areA team of designers, engineers and makers with a passion for quality goods that provide security to everyday scenarios.How will you pull this off?We've a lot of experience in creating, running and fulfilling Kickstarter campaigns. Over the past five years, we've started and fulfilled ten campaigns to thousands of backers all over the world.This activity has established an international business that produces everything by hand here in the UK. We work with leather, 3D printing, a wide variety of metals and plastics. All production takes place in house by our skilled team and all shipping is handled from our workshop.Risks and challengesAs this is our 11th Kickstarter project, we're well prepared to manufacture and fulfil the project, using key partners Royal Mail and FedEx to do so.We are problem solvers so if anything doesn't go to plan, we'll sort it out and get you what was promised, you'll be kept in the loop all the way. We've delivered on our 10 previous Kickstarters and KeyBlock will be no different, because we truly care about the things we make.",22.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Good planets are hard to find and we’re determined to do our part to take care of this one. So we set out to create an eco-friendly watch brand that puts our planet and the people who live on it, at the forefront of our promise.</p>
<p>Our watches are timeless, fun, durable, and crafted with sustainable materials like castor oil based bioplastic, rPet straps made from recycled water bottles, and are powered by the sun, which means we're not sending batteries to the landfill every few months. We have also chosen to focus solely on traditional analogue watches with the hopes of inspiring our customers to make the most of their time by unplugging, getting outside, having fun, and living in the moment.</p>
