I've learned how to evaluate and frame my mistakes so I can learn from them.

<p>16 years ago as a naive 21-year-old I was thrust into the responsibility that comes with public leadership. I read everything I could get my hands on regarding leadership for 10 years. I geeked out on all the models. Pretty soon I learned you could make up a concept and slap a venn diagram together or chart it out on an x-y axis and it sounded smart. </p>
<p>The problem was that it addressed an external reality. In all those years of reading leadership books and going to the conferences and falling for the hype I finally admitted...</p>
<p>I couldn't learn enough about managing my external world that actually fixed the internal world that was driving me to burn bridges and lead out of insecurity. (Just ask the profs I cried in front of at my dissertation defense.)</p>
<p>Thankfully I started capturing insights about how a leader's internal world drives their external world. I've been capturing those insights for 12 years. I obsessively started capturing everything on a spreadsheet that represented my most vulnerable learnings and what was driving my decision making in key wins and losses.</p>
<p>I’ve had to borrow money to cover payroll and I’ve seen wealth created 1000X my investment. I know the highs and lows and complexities of leading organizations in transition and turnarounds. I know startups. I’ve coached leaders of all types. From a full family life to leading multiple non-profit organizations, both large and small, I have learned how to order my internal world so I can lead my external world.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>This Book Is For People That Are Done With Getting In Their Own Way</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This book isn't for everybody. If you're not willing to use some introspective muscles that might have atrophied then you'll probably want to pass. This isn't the only resource on this idea. But I know my journey. And I know I have found 7 organizing realities that keep my thinking in tip-top shape ready for each day to avoid 7 critical mistakes. I can teach you how to order your internal world. Awareness of these 7 mistakes are the recipe that keep me from staying stuck. They can instantly help you reframe every moment to stay resilient. Most quit at some point right before things turn awesome. I want to teach you how to not quit. (If you want to hear some of this in a podcast search ""SightShift podcast"" on the inter webs. Give the first episode 7 minutes.)</p>
<p>Recently, my work with helping leaders figure out who they are apart from what they do has been growing. (If you need the professional vibe check out <a href=""http://chrismcalister.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">chrismcalister.com</a>) And now is the time to create this book and articulate what it means to lead and live from a secure core. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I've had this brewing in me for a while. Remember the spreadsheet? </span></p>
<p>So before the fresh extraction of these lessons turns bitter, let's get this message out. That sounded more like making coffee than learning. </p>
<p>I need your help. Some of you need mine. And together we'll get this done to help others that will come after us. </p>
<p>Let's help people learn from these 7 mistakes: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>I am blindly focused on the goal and don't enjoy the process to get there.</li>
<li>I make myself responsible for the behavior of others.</li>
<li>I insecurely try to be accepted by others.</li>
<li>I repeat the same self-sabotaging choices.</li>
<li>I don't live from a secure core of who I really am.</li>
<li>I am unknowingly guided and driven by fear.</li>
<li>I am internally distracted and miss what is really happening around me. </li>

<p>Learning these 7 mistakes deeply will help you:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Become confident in the most difficult of relationships.</p></li>
<li><p>Get clarity on your mission that transcends your job.</p></li>

<h3>OddBike's USA Tour</h3>
<p>My name is Jason Cormier, and I am the Editor of <a href=""http://www.odd-bike.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Odd-Bike.com</a>, an independent website that specializes in the profiling of rare and unusual motorcycles.</p>
<p>I've long been a passionate motorcycle rider and freelance writer, and OddBike is the culmination of my passions and skills as well as an archive of some of the rarest, most unusual and fascinating two-wheeled machines that have ever put rubber to pavement. As I am a historian by education and a mechanic by hobby, I pride myself in writing detailed profiles that detail the historical context, cultural impact, and technical information of these interesting motorcycles. </p>
<p>I maintain OddBike in my spare time as a non-profit website that is free of sponsorship or advertising. I believe this allows me to write without hindrance and without anyone to answer to, and my articles reflect this freedom. However for certain (more ambitious) projects I require funding from you, my readers and supporters.</p>
<p>This campaign is, at its basis, to fund my journey by motorcycle this October 2013 from my home in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to visit several key locations in the Southern United States, for the purpose of collecting information, interviews and photographs to use in at least three upcoming OddBike features. These features will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A visit to the <a href=""http://motusmotorcycles.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Motus Motorcycles factory in Birmingham, Alabama</a>.</li>
<li>A stop at the <a href=""http://www.barbervintagefestival.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Barber Motorsports Museum in Birmingham to cover the 9th annual Barber Vintage Festival</a>.</li>
<li>A visit to <a href=""http://bienvillestudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bienville Studios in New Orleans, Louisiana</a> to interview motorcycle designer JT Nesbitt about his upcoming Bienville Legacy project.</li>
<li>
<b>NEW</b> A visit to the <a href=""http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=74"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wheels Through Time Museum in Waynesville (Maggie) North Carolina to profile and photograph the 1917 Traub V-Twin</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This journey will be undertaken in mid-October 2013 and will take approximately two weeks, round trip. I will be using my personal 1997 Ducati 916 to perform the journey. It may not be the most appropriate touring rig, but it has served me well over the years and I wouldn't do it on anything else.</p>
<p>I will maintain a travelogue of the journey on the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/OddBike"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OddBike Facebook page</a>, with the intent of eventually writing a detailed ride report.</p>
<p>This journey is more than a simple trip across the USA, it's an opportunity for OddBike to grow by showcasing several unique independent motorcycle projects that have been under-represented in the traditional motorcycle media. I aim to correct that with my own blend of intelligent technical analysis and insight into motorcycle history and design. And I feel the best way to do this is to meet with the individuals in person and examine their projects first-hand.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>To complete this tour I require funding for the following expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Accommodations</li>
<li>Some basic touring gear and maintenance to prepare the 916 for the journey</li>
</ul>
<p>It really is that simple. I am only seeking the funding I need to complete this trip, which will be a round trip of approximately 5000kms over a period of two weeks.</p>

<p>If you can't contribute monetarily, I would greatly appreciate if you shared my campaign and OddBike via social media, and of course I encourage you to read my writing and contribute your opinions on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/OddBike"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> and the <a href=""http://www.odd-bike.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OddBike website.</a> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>September 3rd Update</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""></p>
<p>Update on the OddBike USA Tour Campaign</p>
<p>I want to personally thank everyone that has supported,
shared and/or contributed to the OddBike USA Tour. I’m really psyched up about
this trip and the enthusiasm I’ve gotten from my followers and riding buddies
has been great. However we are still a way off from the goal, so I wanted to
clarify some details and better explain what my intentions are with this
campaign (and what it represents for OddBike’s future). </p>
<p>As I would expect with any campaign that asks strangers to
contribute money, I have received negative feedback. I’m a reasonable man so I
can completely understand why some may have some hesitation, but I think in
general the poor feedback I’ve gotten is due to a lack of understanding more
than any ill will.</p>
<p>Several months ago I was discussing the future of OddBike
with a follower who made an interesting suggestion – keep OddBike independent
and free of sponsors, but ask the readers to fund topics directly. His idea was
to campaign for a specific goal – “ I need X dollars to write an article on
Motorcycle Y”. I put the idea in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>Last month I was invited to Barber by that same follower. He
suggested that I visit several of the manufacturers in the area (those being
Motus, Confederate, and Bienville) to profile them in my own inimitable style.
He reminded me of the crowd sourcing idea, and gave me a verbal kick in the ass
to quit dreaming and start doing.</p>
<p>Thus began the OddBike USA Tour. It was a spur of the moment
idea that has the opportunity to make myself known to several independent
American marques - brands who have been neglected by the traditional media, but
who deserve to be covered in depth. Right up my alley. It also allows me to
take photographs that I can use for future publication, an important thing when
you want to get serious about writing – no matter how good your writing is
everyone wants unique, high-quality images.</p>
<p>I could have easily just campaigned for a plane ticket and a
couple of nights at a hotel, doing everything in three or four days. But that’s
boring. That’s what a traditional motorcycle journalist would do. I’m not a
traditional journalist. And I wanted to make it an adventure, a journey with
its own perils and challenges. I decided I would do it on my Ducati 916, which
is my only vehicle, spending two weeks on the road and covering over 5000 kms.
To keep it cheap and interesting, I’m camping most of the journey, with a few
couches to crash on along the way.</p>
<p>Is it a vacation? Can’t say it isn’t. I am taking two weeks
off work to jump in the saddle and blast across the USA. But I will be working
the whole way. When I’m not riding, I will be visiting stops, taking pictures,
conducting interviews, and of course writing. I hope that the information I
gather on this journey will be enough to write at least 3 top-notch articles
with my own pictures to accompany them, maybe as many as 5 or 6 if all goes
well – and that doesn’t include the in-depth ride report I’m working on.</p>
<p><b>In the interest of full disclosure here is a break down of
the projected expenses:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Total funding amount – 2000$</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> Net after Indiegogo fees – 1800$</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Gas 500$</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Food 400$</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Accommodations (camping fees) 300-400$</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Gear (specifically: luggage, tent, sleeping bag, and a few
odds and ends to get the bike prepped) ~300$</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Thus my high estimate is 1600$, plus another 200-odd bucks
of “oh shit” money, not including the 5-ish percent I’ll lose converting CAD to
USD.</p>
<p>I was hoping to setup some incentives to donate – namely
mugs and T-shirts – but quickly discovered that I couldn’t afford to custom
print anything in small quantities, never mind the exorbitant Canadian shipping
rates to send stuff around the world. If I were printing 50-100 shirts at a
time, it would be worth it. But not when I am printing 10 or 15. Not to say I
won’t get some OddBike items lined up for future events and giveaways, but this
time around it would just be eating into my trip budget. </p>
<p>That being said, feel free to ignore the “perks” on the
Indiegogo site when deciding your contribution. Donate 5$, 10$, or whatever you
please. No need to stick to the “guidelines”, and every little bit helps. I
appreciate every contribution no matter how modest. </p>
<p>Please remember that I run OddBike free of sponsorship and
advertising. I work full time in another, unrelated industry and work on
OddBike, solo, in my free time. I write and publish my work for free, and make
no money off OddBike (full disclosure – I have sold one article for a whopping
40$ but otherwise have provided all my articles free of charge). This campaign
is the beginning of a new concept where you, my readers and my followers, will
directly fund my writing. That way I only have to answer to you, not to some
corporate sponsor. Independence and free opinion is what sets OddBike apart,
and it’s what I aim to maintain. But for more ambitious projects, I need your
help – and rest assured the OddBike USA Tour will not be the last such
endeavour, there are still many weird, rare and odd motorcycles out there that
I hope to profile with your help.</p>
<p>Thanks again and I look forward to hitting the road in
October.</p>

My name is Jason Cormier, and I am the Editor of Odd-Bike.com, an independent website that specializes in the profiling of rare and unusual motorcycles.
I've long been a passionate motorcycle rider and freelance writer, and OddBike is the culmination of my passions and skills as well as an archive of some of the rarest, most unusual and fascinating two-wheeled machines that have ever put rubber to pavement. As I am a historian by education and a mechanic by hobby, I pride myself in writing detailed profiles that detail the historical context, cultural impact, and technical information of these interesting motorcycles. 
I maintain OddBike in my spare time as a non-profit website that is free of sponsorship or advertising. I believe this allows me to write without hindrance and without anyone to answer to, and my articles reflect this freedom. However for certain (more ambitious) projects I require funding from you, my readers and supporters.
This campaign is, at its basis, to fund my journey by motorcycle this October 2013 from my home in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to visit several key locations in the Southern United States, for the purpose of collecting information, interviews and photographs to use in at least three upcoming OddBike features. These features will include:

A visit to the Motus Motorcycles factory in Birmingham, Alabama.
A stop at the Barber Motorsports Museum in Birmingham to cover the 9th annual Barber Vintage Festival.
A visit to Bienville Studios in New Orleans, Louisiana to interview motorcycle designer JT Nesbitt about his upcoming Bienville Legacy project.

NEW A visit to the Wheels Through Time Museum in Waynesville (Maggie) North Carolina to profile and photograph the 1917 Traub V-Twin.

This journey will be undertaken in mid-October 2013 and will take approximately two weeks, round trip. I will be using my personal 1997 Ducati 916 to perform the journey. It may not be the most appropriate touring rig, but it has served me well over the years and I wouldn't do it on anything else.
I will maintain a travelogue of the journey on the OddBike Facebook page, with the intent of eventually writing a detailed ride report.
This journey is more than a simple trip across the USA, it's an opportunity for OddBike to grow by showcasing several unique independent motorcycle projects that have been under-represented in the traditional motorcycle media. I aim to correct that with my own blend of intelligent technical analysis and insight into motorcycle history and design. And I feel the best way to do this is to meet with the individuals in person and examine their projects first-hand.  


What I Need
To complete this tour I require funding for the following expenses:

Gas
Food
Accommodations
Some basic touring gear and maintenance to prepare the 916 for the journey

It really is that simple. I am only seeking the funding I need to complete this trip, which will be a round trip of approximately 5000kms over a period of two weeks.

Other Ways to Help
If you can't contribute monetarily, I would greatly appreciate if you shared my campaign and OddBike via social media, and of course I encourage you to read my writing and contribute your opinions on Facebook and the OddBike website. 
I am also seeking accommodations along my route to keep expenses to a minimum - if you have a couch and a safe place to park my bike, please get in touch with me and we can discuss.

September 3rd Update


Update on the OddBike USA Tour Campaign
I want to personally thank everyone that has supported,
shared and/or contributed to the OddBike USA Tour. I’m really psyched up about
this trip and the enthusiasm I’ve gotten from my followers and riding buddies
has been great. However we are still a way off from the goal, so I wanted to
clarify some details and better explain what my intentions are with this
campaign (and what it represents for OddBike’s future). 
As I would expect with any campaign that asks strangers to
contribute money, I have received negative feedback. I’m a reasonable man so I
can completely understand why some may have some hesitation, but I think in
general the poor feedback I’ve gotten is due to a lack of understanding more
than any ill will.
Several months ago I was discussing the future of OddBike
with a follower who made an interesting suggestion – keep OddBike independent
and free of sponsors, but ask the readers to fund topics directly. His idea was
to campaign for a specific goal – “ I need X dollars to write an article on
Motorcycle Y”. I put the idea in the back of my mind.
Last month I was invited to Barber by that same follower. He
suggested that I visit several of the manufacturers in the area (those being
Motus, Confederate, and Bienville) to profile them in my own inimitable style.
He reminded me of the crowd sourcing idea, and gave me a verbal kick in the ass
to quit dreaming and start doing.
Thus began the OddBike USA Tour. It was a spur of the moment
idea that has the opportunity to make myself known to several independent
American marques - brands who have been neglected by the traditional media, but
who deserve to be covered in depth. Right up my alley. It also allows me to
take photographs that I can use for future publication, an important thing when
you want to get serious about writing – no matter how good your writing is
everyone wants unique, high-quality images.
I could have easily just campaigned for a plane ticket and a
couple of nights at a hotel, doing everything in three or four days. But that’s
boring. That’s what a traditional motorcycle journalist would do. I’m not a
traditional journalist. And I wanted to make it an adventure, a journey with
its own perils and challenges. I decided I would do it on my Ducati 916, which
is my only vehicle, spending two weeks on the road and covering over 5000 kms.
To keep it cheap and interesting, I’m camping most of the journey, with a few
couches to crash on along the way.
Is it a vacation? Can’t say it isn’t. I am taking two weeks
off work to jump in the saddle and blast across the USA. But I will be working
the whole way. When I’m not riding, I will be visiting stops, taking pictures,
conducting interviews, and of course writing. I hope that the information I
gather on this journey will be enough to write at least 3 top-notch articles
with my own pictures to accompany them, maybe as many as 5 or 6 if all goes
well – and that doesn’t include the in-depth ride report I’m working on.
In the interest of full disclosure here is a break down of
the projected expenses:


Total funding amount – 2000$
 Net after Indiegogo fees – 1800$

Gas 500$


Food 400$


Accommodations (camping fees) 300-400$


Gear (specifically: luggage, tent, sleeping bag, and a few
odds and ends to get the bike prepped) ~300$



Thus my high estimate is 1600$, plus another 200-odd bucks
of “oh shit” money, not including the 5-ish percent I’ll lose converting CAD to
USD.
I was hoping to setup some incentives to donate – namely
mugs and T-shirts – but quickly discovered that I couldn’t afford to custom
print anything in small quantities, never mind the exorbitant Canadian shipping
rates to send stuff around the world. If I were printing 50-100 shirts at a
time, it would be worth it. But not when I am printing 10 or 15. Not to say I
won’t get some OddBike items lined up for future events and giveaways, but this
time around it would just be eating into my trip budget. 
That being said, feel free to ignore the “perks” on the
Indiegogo site when deciding your contribution. Donate 5$, 10$, or whatever you
please. No need to stick to the “guidelines”, and every little bit helps. I
appreciate every contribution no matter how modest. 
Please remember that I run OddBike free of sponsorship and
advertising. I work full time in another, unrelated industry and work on
OddBike, solo, in my free time. I write and publish my work for free, and make
no money off OddBike (full disclosure – I have sold one article for a whopping
40$ but otherwise have provided all my articles free of charge). This campaign
is the beginning of a new concept where you, my readers and my followers, will
directly fund my writing. That way I only have to answer to you, not to some
corporate sponsor. Independence and free opinion is what sets OddBike apart,
and it’s what I aim to maintain. But for more ambitious projects, I need your
help – and rest assured the OddBike USA Tour will not be the last such
endeavour, there are still many weird, rare and odd motorcycles out there that
I hope to profile with your help.
Thanks again and I look forward to hitting the road in
October.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Allow us to introduce ourselves: we are Jessie Mannisto and Chris Wells, a former CIA leadership analyst and Google fellow, and an educational psychologist and author, respectively. We’re the founders and lead editors of Third Factor, and we're working to bring together psychologists, educators, activists, writers and artists, spiritual leaders, divergent thinkers, and others interested in exploring this thing called positive disintegration.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>So far, we've built Third Factor out of our own donated time, energy, and funds.  But as with every endeavor, if we have more funds available, we can really extend our reach and our appeal.  Here's how we'll do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'll hire an artist to create a logo and artwork for the site that visually represent the ideals of positive disintegration, drawing people in at first glance.</li>
<li>We'll launch a social media marketing campaign, to reach those positively maladjusted people who aren't fortunate enough to know someone who shared our work organically.</li>
<li>We'll cover all those things on the backend of the site that aren't glamorous to talk about here, but that everyone notices when they stop working, including secure and reliable web hosting, WordPress designs and plugins, and the like.</li>
<li>We'll begin to pay our writers and editors (in concert with funds from our ongoing Patreon) who are at present donating their labor because they value the theory of positive disintegration and share our belief that the world needs to hear about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our funding goal, we'll still be able to apply the funds we do raise to the goals above.  The amount we raise simply affects how well our site will function, how catchy it will look, how high the quality of our articles will be, and how far our reach will extend,</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we succeed in getting Third Factor off the ground, this will give Dabrowski's work a tremendous boost.  Right now, few people outside of academia and education know anything about it.  Someone's got to bridge that gap if we want these ideas to flourish and make the mark they're capable of making.</p>
<p>Seriously, have you turned on the news lately?  The world <i>needs </i>the theory of positive disintegration.  And we're not going to stick only with theory; we're going to have interviews with people out there making a difference, <i>living </i>their reintegration through constructive social engagement of all sorts.  While the primary integrated have energy to spare, people at Level III often need a bit of a boost.  We're going to get them that boost.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone has financial resources available. But there are other ways you can help!  Please share this campaign and/or our articles with people you think should know about positive disintegration.  Our ultimate goal is to raise the number of people who have this lens to make sense of their lives and the world.  And on that note, every little social media share helps.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><strong><i>Iterating Autism</i></strong> is a guidebook to a more experimental approach to autism, exploring how a design thinking mindset can lead to unimaginable growth in any individual with autism.<br/><br/>My name is Ayush Agrawal, and I am the author of Iterating Autism. I was inspired to write this book because of my own experiences and struggles with autism. I am the older brother of autistic 11-year-old Aryan, having struggled with and thought about autism for over nine years now.<br/><br/>My hope in this book is to convince you that the well-thought and personalized approach to autism is truly superior to simply following the path of those who have been successful before you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you conquer the multitude of difficulties autism can throw at you.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll not only learn about approaching autism more effectively with an experimental mindset, you'll also discover popular yet misguided autism “treatments” as well as how to overcome the social, emotional, and psychological troubles that often accompany a family member with autism. You'll hear stories such as how...</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinmay Nair overcame challenges with diets, sleeping, tantrums, and learning</li>
<li>Setting SMARTer goals helped us determine Aryan’s core issues with autism</li>
<li>A certain popular dietary approach to autism caused much more harm than good in Anushka</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are the caretaker of a newly diagnosed individual with autism, someone struggling to differentiate and gain success from conventional autism treatments, or simply someone who wants to support a loved one with autism.<br/><br/><i>Iterating Autism</i> is a nonfiction book that especially speaks to caretakers of individuals with autism who want to look at autism treatment and coping in a new way.</p>
<h3>The Book - Iterating Autism</h3>
<p><i>Iterating Autism</i> is written in 2 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong>, containing the introduction and chapters 1-6, forms the core of the book, delving into the specific steps of well thought-out improvement. You’ll learn how to clearly recognize the specifics of the disorder, set SMART goals, effectively track data (especially since a caretaker’s schedule is often too busy to keep sufficient track), and maintain resilience during the tough times.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong>, containing chapters 7-10, focuses more on the various outside factors that can affect and/or hinder the process outlined in Part 1. We will discuss some of the most popular yet also potentially misleading treatments such as the gluten-free-casein-free (‘GF/CF’) diet. We will also talk about how to cope with the immense emotional, psychological, and social stresses that, if not addressed appropriately, can make life with autism spiral downward quickly.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p><strong>Ayush Agrawal </strong>is a high school student from San Diego, California. He loves spending time with his younger autistic brother, Aryan, and regularly volunteers as a buddy to an autistic individual as part of a local organization’s Buddy Program. He is also deeply interested in STEM fields, especially the environmental sciences, currently interning at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and leading a research project to degrade toxic pesticides.<br/><br/>Throughout Ayush’s life, his family has sought ways to decrease the pain, anxiety, stress, and confusion Aryan has to undertake in his everyday life. Watching Aryan pound his head against the wall in frustration, scream in pain, and shed tears when tired and scared pushed Ayush and his family to find any possible solution to alleviate Aryan’s troubles. While it hasn’t cured him completely, the iterative process certainly has forever changed Aryan’s autism for the better. Ayush wants to share their journey so that other caretakers of autistic individuals don’t have to go through the same mistakes and troubles he and his family have endured over the last 9 years.<br/><br/>When not immersed in typing out the next sentence, Ayush enjoys spending time at San Diego’s gorgeous beaches, playing cards with his family and friends, catching up on the latest environmental news, and enduring his friends’ taunts for being too tall.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Ayush at <strong>ayush.agrawal2410@gmail.com</strong> and at @ayush.agrawal2410 on Instagram.<br/> </p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Path to PM: The Non-Traditional Journey into Product Management</i> is about breaking into product management in tech for people with unique and non-technical backgrounds. It's filled with actionable advice, real stories, and frameworks that you can use to inspire and build an understanding of product management.<br/><br/>My name is Allison Lai and I am the author of <i>Path to PM: The Non-Traditional Journey into Product Management</i>. I wrote this book to motivate people who are interested in product management (PM) in technology, but feel that they don’t have the skills needed to make the jump into the role. Impostor syndrome can hit you hard and people might feel that they lack the “technical skills” needed to become a product manager. I hope to fight this myth because I felt the same fear that I wouldn’t stand out as a strong candidate in the field. I decided to take the steps that helped me land my first two roles in PM, which I want to share in order to support those who need that extra push!<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover it is possible for people to break into PM without computer science degrees or strong coding skills. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for product management! Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you take your first steps.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn what product management is and how you can leverage or build experiences that will help you land your desired role. You'll learn things such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Advice and real journeys from over 20+ product managers in tech, such as Microsoft and Facebook.</li>
<li>Actionable advice and tips for your career and challenges that you may encounter during recruiting.</li>
<li>Effective frameworks and new perspectives related to product development.</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you are someone learning about product management and want to know how to begin thinking like a product manager. You will enjoy hearing about people’s unique journeys into tech, or you may decide to make a lateral move in your career!<br/><br/><i>Path to PM: The Non-Traditional Journey into Product Management</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to aspiring product managers, college graduates, and individuals making lateral career changes who want to look at product management in a new way.<br/> <h3>The Book - Path to PM: The Non-Traditional Journey into Product Management</h3>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-2. Here, we kick off by learning about what is product management, what does the industry looks like right now, and where will the industry go from here. This serves as an in-depth view of how product management came to be from the memo from the Father of Product Management, Neil McElroy, a P&amp;G manager in 1931 who defined the role of future product managers.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 3-7. These chapters cover the five principles and characteristics that make up an effective product manager. Here, we dig into the meat of the book.

Path to PM: The Non-Traditional Journey into Product Management is about breaking into product management in tech for people with unique and non-technical backgrounds. It's filled with actionable advice, real stories, and frameworks that you can use to inspire and build an understanding of product management.My name is Allison Lai and I am the author of Path to PM: The Non-Traditional Journey into Product Management. I wrote this book to motivate people who are interested in product management (PM) in technology, but feel that they don’t have the skills needed to make the jump into the role. Impostor syndrome can hit you hard and people might feel that they lack the “technical skills” needed to become a product manager. I hope to fight this myth because I felt the same fear that I wouldn’t stand out as a strong candidate in the field. I decided to take the steps that helped me land my first two roles in PM, which I want to share in order to support those who need that extra push!My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover it is possible for people to break into PM without computer science degrees or strong coding skills. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for product management! Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you take your first steps.In this book, you'll learn what product management is and how you can leverage or build experiences that will help you land your desired role. You'll learn things such as...

Advice and real journeys from over 20+ product managers in tech, such as Microsoft and Facebook.
Actionable advice and tips for your career and challenges that you may encounter during recruiting.
Effective frameworks and new perspectives related to product development.
You will love this book if you are someone learning about product management and want to know how to begin thinking like a product manager. You will enjoy hearing about people’s unique journeys into tech, or you may decide to make a lateral move in your career!Path to PM: The Non-Traditional Journey into Product Management is a nonfiction book that speaks to aspiring product managers, college graduates, and individuals making lateral career changes who want to look at product management in a new way. The Book - Path to PM: The Non-Traditional Journey into Product ManagementThe book is written in 3 parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-2. Here, we kick off by learning about what is product management, what does the industry looks like right now, and where will the industry go from here. This serves as an in-depth view of how product management came to be from the memo from the Father of Product Management, Neil McElroy, a P&G manager in 1931 who defined the role of future product managers.Part 2 contains chapters 3-7. These chapters cover the five principles and characteristics that make up an effective product manager. Here, we dig into the meat of the book. You will read different examples, stories, and research that illustrate the importance of each trait! You will learn about different frameworks, specific terminology used in product management, and a structured game-plan for you to begin working on your own project!Part 3 contains chapters 8-11.

</p><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I started a
project called Hudson River Zeitgeist in April of this year. The project
has become an open-ended oral history project exploring both the changes the twentieth century
brought to the mid-Hudson Valley and the human experience of the area’s working
class. To date, I’ve published fifteen interviews.</p>
<p>As the year went
on, I started thinking about the idea of shelf life. If these interviews live
only on the Web, they’ll soon get lost in that fast-paced world, and will only
exist archived on there for however many years I pay the website’s hosting and
URL fees. I decided in the past couple months that there ought to be a more
tangible record of the stories and the experiences shared in the interviews.</p>
<p>My plan now is to
publish a short-run of 250 copies of a book with those fifteen interviews, an
introduction and an additional two previously unpublished interviews. It's a fairly tight timeline, but I'm hoping to have copies sent out before Christmas.<br/></p>
<p>By donating to
this campaign, you’re not only pre-ordering a book, you’re investing in at
least one more year of Hudson River Zeitgeist as a project. One hundred percent
of the proceeds will go toward the 2016 re-launch and subsequent season of
interviews and stories on Hudson River Zeitgeist.</p>
<p>This year focused
on people in my home area—Germantown, Hudson, Red Hook and surrounding towns.
My plan for next year is to use the project to explore the experiences and histories
of the people of river towns along the tidal Hudson, from The Bronx to Troy,
from Nyack to Albany, and plenty of the rural areas in between. </p>
<p>About fifty
percent of the proceeds from the book will go to a marketing budget to continue growing the readership next year. The other fifty percent
will be ear-marked for a freelance budget, to provide, in addition to the
interviews, a variety of feature stories about strange and forgotten chapters and pages
of the Hudson River Valley’s history. </p>
<p>This campaign and
the entire project is, in part, an experiment to explore whether a new and
unique media company, with bare-bones overhead costs, can be crowdfunded—the
context of course being the continual upheaval and the flailing of previously successful
media business models.</p>
<p>To touch a bit on
my background, I grew up in Germantown, New York, and started my career as a
newspaper reporter for the <i>Hudson
Register-Star</i>. I studied at Columbia University’s graduate school of
journalism and, as a freelance writer, have written stories for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Boston Globe</i> and a bunch of others. I write on the side and
work for Camphill Hudson and the Devereux Foundation and hope to never be
drawn away from the Hudson River Valley.</p>
<p>Through the
interviews this year, I’ve learned about the local effects of the Great
Depression, Prohibition, World War II; the rise of automobiles and the modern
amenities of electricity and indoor plumbing; of differing perceptions of the
ways the area and society in general have changed in recent decades; and of how
various people cope with often-relentless adversity.</p>

$25 up to $2,500. If you’d rather, paper checks can be made out to Hudson River Zeitgeist and sent (but must be received by
Nov. 30) with a note mentioning your donation level to P.O. Box 64 , Germantown, NY 12526

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>The <i>Gen-Z Book</i> is about Gen-Z. But here’s some more. In the book, I go into specific nuances of Gen-Z; What do we like talking about? What do we care about? What’s unique about our generation, and why should you care?<br/><br/>My name is Riya Goel and I am the author of <i>The Gen-Z Book</i>. I wrote this book because I’m a Gen-zer myself, and I wanted to see more written about Gen-Z by a Gen-Zer. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover and learn more about my generation. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for Gen-Z. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you learn about Gen-Z and how to promote intergenerational conversation and equity to make the world a better place.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about Gen-Z, why we matter, and some of our characteristics as a generation. You'll hear stories such as...<ul>
<li>Ziad Ahmed, the CEO of JUV consulting on why you should talk “to Gen-Z and not about us.”</li>
<li>Matt Sarafa, the CEO of Matt Sarafa fashion on why we should embrace diversity. </li>
<li>Ava McDonald, the CEO of Zfluence on why authenticity matters. </li>
</ul>You will love this book if you are Gen-Z, know someone from Gen-Z, or are just trying to understand Gen-Z.<br/><br/>The Gen-Z Book is a nonfiction book that speaks to parents, CEOs, industry leaders, Gen-Zers themselves, and really those who want to look at and learn about Gen-Z in a new way.<br/> <h3><strong>The Book - The Gen-Z Book</strong></h3>The book is written in 4 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1: What is change and what is Gen-Z's role in change?</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-2. This section provides the reasoning behind why youth have always been at the forefront of change, and sets up the scene for where Gen-Z comes into play while providing background on the generation. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2: What's so unique about us (with stories ofc!) and how does Gen-Z do things differently?</strong> contains the chapters 3-12. These chapters, which are the majority of the book, go into specific characteristics of Gen-Z through interviews with Gen-Zers, and other industry leaders in their respective fields. I discuss topics from Gen-Z's global network to the collective trauma that we carry as a generation. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3: So Gen-Z is pretty cool.

</div></div>","Story of My BookThe Gen-Z Book is about Gen-Z. But here’s some more. In the book, I go into specific nuances of Gen-Z; What do we like talking about? What do we care about? What’s unique about our generation, and why should you care?My name is Riya Goel and I am the author of The Gen-Z Book. I wrote this book because I’m a Gen-zer myself, and I wanted to see more written about Gen-Z by a Gen-Zer. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover and learn more about my generation. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for Gen-Z. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you learn about Gen-Z and how to promote intergenerational conversation and equity to make the world a better place.In this book, you'll learn about Gen-Z, why we matter, and some of our characteristics as a generation. You'll hear stories such as...
Ziad Ahmed, the CEO of JUV consulting on why you should talk “to Gen-Z and not about us.”
Matt Sarafa, the CEO of Matt Sarafa fashion on why we should embrace diversity. 
Ava McDonald, the CEO of Zfluence on why authenticity matters. 
You will love this book if you are Gen-Z, know someone from Gen-Z, or are just trying to understand Gen-Z.The Gen-Z Book is a nonfiction book that speaks to parents, CEOs, industry leaders, Gen-Zers themselves, and really those who want to look at and learn about Gen-Z in a new way. The Book - The Gen-Z BookThe book is written in 4 parts.Part 1: What is change and what is Gen-Z's role in change? contains the introduction + chapters 1-2. This section provides the reasoning behind why youth have always been at the forefront of change, and sets up the scene for where Gen-Z comes into play while providing background on the generation. Part 2: What's so unique about us (with stories ofc!) and how does Gen-Z do things differently? contains the chapters 3-12. These chapters, which are the majority of the book, go into specific characteristics of Gen-Z through interviews with Gen-Zers, and other industry leaders in their respective fields. I discuss topics from Gen-Z's global network to the collective trauma that we carry as a generation. Part 3: So Gen-Z is pretty cool. But what does that mean and what do we do now? contains chapters 13-16. Here, I address everyone that intersects into Gen-Z. Are you a Gen-Zer? Chapter 13 is for you. Are you a CEO or aspiring CEO? Read Chapter 15. Part 4: Peace out. This is (hopefully) what you learned contains chapter 17. These are my final words, a summary of the book, and what I hope my readers took out of it! What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

<h3>Why El Salvador?<br/><span style=""color: black;""></span>

<span style=""color: black;"">El
  Salvador</span><span style=""color: black;"">
hasnâ€™t been in the news much lately, so you may be wondering why there is a
need for election observers.  A little back story: in the 1980â€™s, US military aid fueled El Salvadorâ€™s Civil War. The repressive military dictatorship had for years been killing anyone who spoke out against the severe economic inequality. Workers, students, farmers, the unemployed, and priests were murdered in the thousands, among these the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8sHNKvGm7g"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Archbishop Oscar Romero</a>. The Salvadoran people organized u</span><span style=""color: black;"">nderground to defend themselves. They took up arms and fought from 1980-1992. The conflict ended with a truce that included official recognition of the rebel forces as a political party - the FMLN. Since the first post-war elections in 1994, the FMLN has
continued to consult and work with the population to define their political
goals in terms of the people's priorities. It's very refreshing to see a
political party represent a poor and working class majority, whose needs have
been ignored for so long. </span><br/>

<p><font color=""#000000"">As an elections observer, I will do my small part to mend the damages done by many years of US interference in El Salvador by continuing a Central New York tradition of standing with the Salvadoran people. During El Salvador's last presidential
elections in 2009, the FMLN candidate won â€“ despite a barrage of
electoral fraud and the government party's fear campaign. Past elections had been rife with fraud, disinformation and
political intimidation to frighten voters from voting their conscience at the
polls. Some US government
officials played an unfortunate role in this as well, threatening to retaliate
against Salvadoran immigrants in the US if the FMLN won the presidency (see Democracy Now! March 13 2009.) In the run-up to the 2009 elections, CISPES and other grassroots groups succeeded in pressuring the US government to declare its neutrality with respect to El Salvador's elections. And just before election day, the US pledged that relations with El Salvador would not change based on who the Salvadoran people elected.<br/></font></p>

Max goes to great lengths to try to grow a mustache, he even eats liver and onions (ewhhh) all to no avail; till one day Max mysteriously grows a mustache and it's everything he ever wished for. Max becomes an overnight celebrity, the youngest person to win a national mustache competition and grace the cover of Mustache Magazine; but his mustache grows out of control and the situation becomes pretty hairy when nothing can control his unruly whiskers...</p>
<p><strong style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><span style=""font-size: 2em;"">Why a mustache, why not a beard? Do you have something against beards?</span></strong><br/></p>
<p><em>No, no, no you have it all wrong! I love all facial hair; beards, mustaches, eyebrows, etc. If it makes you feel any better I will consider writing a story and include beards. </em></p>
<p><strong style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><span style=""font-size: 2em;"">""With Great Mustache Comes Great Responsibility""...</span></strong><br/></p>
<p>First of all I wanted to write a book that would make children laugh out loud, there is nothing more contagious than the laughter of children. In doing so with some of the proceeds I am hoping to also put a smile on the face of children, survivors and families of childhood cancer. As a Partner in Hope with St. Jude Hospital I know that my book will help money and the spirits of everyone affected by childhood cancer.

<p>My story isn't intended to be too terrible moral although it does have a universal message that I believe will resonate in the hearts of readers young and old and that is… <em>""Not everything you wish for is all it’s cracked up to be; so be careful what you wish for, because it just might come true"".</em>  Max and the Magnificent Mustache stirs a child's imagination, curiosity and intellect; with a message that is sure to open up the lines of communication, which I found out first hand when I read my manuscript to some of my toughest critics....Second Graders!</p>

<p>It was AMAZING to watch their faces and to hear what they had to say about the story. Some kids had alternate endings for me and new adventures for max. Some kids shared their deepest wishes, some were silly, some were serious, but wishes all the same. I was blown away when one little girl told me...she thought Max's mustache grew so out of control because of all the attention he was getting, ""he let it all go to his head"" she said.

<p>This process is extremely expensive but through Amazon we are able to publish a paperback book and an e-book for those with nook/kindle; all within our means. Your pledges will also go toward printing the book in hardcover, not just in English but in different languages as well. This is the most expensive step, to publish the book in hardback; since we will be using a more traditional printing service for this process. It cost upwards of $3,000 or more for 500 fully illustrated and colored hardcover books; we want to print as many as we can, not just to sell but we want to be able to gift Max and the Magnificent Mustache to school library's and children's hospitals.

Recently I finished writing a fiction book under the title ""Going Nuts in Kaua'i --- love, humor and spirituality"" and can sure use a little help in launching this out to the world. My plan is to make a print-on-demand paperback book, plus Kindle and e-book edition to sell on Amazon.
 
The story: An ordinary woman goes to the island of Kaua'i to find a quiet life, and possibly the man of her dreams. She finds those all right, and much, much more. Totally unprepared for what's coming, before she knows it, she starts down the path of a crash “coarse” in spirituality and discovers other worlds that surround all, of which she had not been aware. 
Written with a light touch, laughter and a bit of drama, it’s about how fascinating life can be, if you just see it in a different way.

Excerpts from the book:
 
“And what do you do for a living?”
“I'm retarded.”
 “You mean, you're retired?”
 “No I mean, retarded, see?” He rolls up his eyes and makes a funny face. Her face goes blank for a moment or two, then eases into a smile.
 “Well, uh, we always welcome people with some humor.”

 One night I had a very short dream. It was a quick flash of a dream that felt very strange. It was just one scene: I am looking at a row of tall trees, like a small forest. There is a lot of space between the tree trunks and through those spaces, I can see a very large, green mountain in the distance. Then, I wake up. That's all. 
 It seems like just a second or two that I saw this view. Yet, somehow I sensed that this is a place in Kaua'i. I don't know how I know, but I know that's where it is. After this dream, I also knew that I would go there for real. I still had to work on the details of how and when, but my heart knew for sure that I would be there. So, from that point on, I prepared for my move with confidence, despite that my friends looked at me at first in surprise, and then in disbelief. They couldn't even imagine me moving so far away to a place where I knew no one.

Quote from a song that resonates with this story:
RETURN TO FOREVER 
 
I think it's time we return to forever 
Where we can fly like birds of a feather 
Never say you're sorry and never say never 
It's really time we return to forever 
 
And if you fall I will help you back up 
And if you call I will always pick up 
And I will see you no matter what they say 
And if we must part I will love you anyway 
 
I think it's time we return to forever 
Where we can fly like birds of a feather 
Never say you're sorry and never say never 
It's really time we return to forever 
 
The way to find your bliss is to lose your monkey mind 
Look up so you don't miss the love you've been trying to find 
 
I think it's time we return to forever...

<p>I am 50 years young and was born near Reading, PA. When I was 19 and in my sophomore year of college, I broke my neck playing tackle football and have been in a wheelchair for over 30 years. I transferred to a wheelchair accessible college just south of Erie, PA. Since my injury, I have earned a Master's degree, been nominated for a Rhode's scholarship, traveled around the world as a wheelchair athlete, founded a theater, and a stand-up comedy troupe, been an advocate, free-lance writer, talk-show host, and a fine judge of whiskey. My story will educate you on what is abuse and how it affects everything you do, what disability is and isn't, how God has been my co-pilot, though many times, I opted to take a bus. Finally, I analyze forgiveness and how betrayal can make it so difficult.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will use the $5,000 to self-publish my autobiography. I am doing this so I can keep the rights, because there's a chance my story could be made into a movie. I will self-publish using a company called Xlibris, which will handle the copyrighting, editing, design, marketing, and the creation of my own website.</p>
<p>Contributors will get a personal thank-you email for donations of $10-$20, personal phone call for $21-$50, autographed copy of the book for $51-$75, and a mention in the book for $76 on up. If I don't get all the funding I need, I will launch another campaign to earn the rest.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""The Long Journey Home"" is real life, not Hollywood's sugary sweet version of disability. In the beginning, the reader sees an abused kid powerless to help his more severely abused mother. His chair is sent into his life as both his tormentor and liberator. His rehab and adjustment are difficult and intense. His mother dies just months later.</p>
<p>My autobiography will forever change everyone who reads it. It will force you to think, re-evaluate, laugh out loud, and hurt. Many stereotypes are weakened and/or laid to waste.</p>

<p><b>Why this book matters:</b><br/><br/>The Bible is a foundational book of our civilization.  Whether we be pagan, atheist, Hindi, Muslim,
Buddhist, Jewish, Christian or something else, we are affected by the writings because the most
basic of our western values have been shaped by its words.  The roots of our civilization have been built
upon this foundation.  <br/><br/>But what if the lessons are 
different than what we think?  How would our lives be different?  How 
would our culture be different?  <br/><br/>It is only by changing the 
fundamental stories underpinning our culture that we can change the 
paradigms we live by. <u>One Gods</u>  explores these fundamental stories and 
offers new paradigms based on the oldest of teachings. <br/></p>
<p><u>One Gods</u> is
a deep dive of spiritual forensics, a journey through history using shamanic knowledge
to explore cross-cultural teachings found in the Bible. Here are some examples of the connections:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Moses and the Celtic Bard Taliesin</li>
<li>Noah and the Hindu God Vishnu </li>
<li>The Shekinah, Venus and the MesoAmerican
Quezalcóatl</li>
<li>Samson, Hercules and the Norse God
Tyr  </li>
</ul>
<p>The ancient mystery schools of Greece, Egypt and
other cultures also hold many of the keys.<span>  <br/></span></p>
<p><span></span><u>One Gods</u> also includes
 experiential exercises designed to deepen one's own spiritual 
fullness based on the Biblical lessons presented.  </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>A note on paganism:</b><br/><br/></p>
<p>While the word has become
pejorative, “pagan” simply means countryside or peasant, someone who lives
close to the land and in harmony with nature. 
To those who stop to listen, each landscape has its own vibratory
essence, its own music if you will.  It
was (and still is) pagan peoples who have been nourished by this knowledge, and
who have held it in sacred trust through oral, and later, written
teachings.  </p>
<br/><p><b>The
Bible is a Document of Wonder and Mystery</b></p>
<p><span>The Bible is filled with wondrous
happenings.  People speak directly to the
Lord, or in other words, communicate with divinity. There are angels; an otherworldly serpent (discussed in Chapter 10), <a href=""#_edn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span></span></span></span></a> and a bush filled with fire that does not burn (discussed in Chapter 4).  Jerusalem is a focal point for the world's
three major western patriarchal religions; yet the city retains the name of its
original guiding deity who was not male. 
Jerusalem was named for a goddess – Venus in her aspect as the evening
star (discussed in Chapter 5)<a href=""#_edn3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span></span></span></span></a>
</span></p>
<p>Magic lurks within the mists of Biblical
folklore; a stone that springs water (discussed in Chapter 3), <a href=""#_edn4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></a>
a ladder ascending to the heavens (discussed in Chapter 6), a serpent perched upon a staff with the power to heal (discussed in Chapter 11). Teachings are veiled within the Hebrew
language, its oldest script forged from the fires of the heavens (discussed in Chapter 8)<a href=""#_edn7"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span></span></span></span></a>
Ancient knowledge lies hidden deep within the text.  </p>
<p><span> The
Bible contains great journeys between Canaan and Egypt and back again.  There are struggles, quests and heroes.  There is sacred wind/breath/speech giving
rise to human life (discussed in Chapters 1 and 2),
the Tower of Babel that confused human speech and still trips us up today when
we try to understand what the writers felt and how they thought; symbols of
power that still hold the keys to great mysteries. </span></p>
<p>There is the mystery of a God who can be
both immanent and personal while at the same time being transcendent (discussed in Chapter 7). There is Adam or Adamah, whose name means red
earth, and Eve or Chava, meaning life. 
It could be said that it was Eve’s birthright to eat the fruit, for the
Tree of Life bears her name, Chava, Life (discussed in Chapter 10).</p>
<p>In delving into these mysteries we don't
strip away the wonderment but rather grow ever more amazed at how the nature of
life, creation and mystery fit together in such perfection.<span>  How did people know?  How could it be that knowledge in the Bible parallels
knowledge held by MesoAmerican Aztecs (discussed in Chapter 2 and throughout the book)?<a href=""#_edn11"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span></span></span></span></a> Native Hawaiians (Chapter 1 and throughout the book)?<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span></span></span></span></a> The Celts of Britain or tribes of Tibet for
that matter (Chapter 2 and throughout the book)? How can Biblical symbols contain such power
so many thousands of years after they were first written?  How can they still capture our imaginations
today?  </span></p>
<p>Exploring these wonders is a journey I
have wanted to take my entire lifetime.<span> 
You are invited to join me in this adventure.  </span></p>
<p>My name is Janet Rudolph.  After a life long interest in comparative religion, I answered 
the call of shamanism almost 20 years ago.  I have traveled throughout 
the world to experience and learn first hand how the mysteries of life 
have come to be  expressed, blessed, honored and lived in differing lands and cultures.  <u>One Gods</u> is the culmination of these experiences.  </p>
<p>Included in the book are some of the Biblical stories that I have rewritten with a shamanic outlook.   <br/></p>
<p><b>The Video</b></p>
<p>Here is an excerpt of my story of Jacob as told in the video above (for those who like their stories in more static form).  The full story and discussion of this story appear in Chapter 6 of <u>One Gods</u>:</p>

<br/>As the MorningStar rose in the sky, Jacob was initiated and like all new initiates, like his ancestors Abram and Sarai before him, he was granted a new name, a spirit name.  The name he was given was a blend of the gods of Egypt and Canaan.  He took the name of the moon goddess of the Egyptians (Isis) and the Egyptian sun god (Ra), along with the Great Bull God of the Canaanites (El).  Henceforth his name would be known as Is-Ra-El.  <br/><br/>(The photographs used in the video are my own.

<p>""Overall, <i>Book Fight!</i> tends to be an enjoyable chat with two dudes who get passionate about the craft, call out authors on their bullshit, shout-out great lit when they read it, and consume a lot of pop culture.

<p>We love doing the show and have a ton of fun doing it, but it is a lot of work and there are ongoing expenses. <b>We're asking regular listeners (and new listeners who want to support independent voices in literature) to donate to the show so that we can keep it going, continue improving it, and keep it free to download each week</b>. </p>
<p>We hope you'll consider your donation a small subscription fee for <a href=""http://bookfightpod.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the 60+ hours of free entertainment we upload every week</a>.

</div><div> <p>This year, we're trying to raise $5,000. Any progress toward this ultimate goal will help us to achieve a number of incremental goals:</p> <ul> <li>
<b>Paying ongoing administrative costs</b>: web hosting on Wordpress and file hosting on Libsyn, plus the cost of new books (only one book in the show's history has been sent as a review copy, and while we like throwing our money at authors and publishers--especially independent publishers--this is an out-of-pocket cost that does add up).</li> <li>
<b>Equipment upgrades</b>: we'd love to get a fourth microphone so we can accommodate an extra guest from time to time, and also higher quality mics to improve sound quality on the show. We'd also like to get equipment to improve our mobile recording capabilities so that we can accommodate guests who can't make it to New Jersey to record. This would widen our range of possible guests and allow us to bring more new and exciting voices to the show.</li>
<li>
<b>Live shows on the road</b>! We love the community that has sprung up around this show and we'd really like to bring the show out to our fans. This past year, we hosted <a href=""http://bookfightpod.com/2014/10/06/live-from-the-spiral-bookcase-in-manayunk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our first live show here in Philadelphia</a>, and we'd love to do live shows in other cities--including yours. But touring costs a lot of money, and we are far from rich! Note that this is probably the biggest expense on this list.</li>
<li>Any cash left over will be treated as a (small) salary for our work on the show, which is posted free and receives no ad revenue of any kind. </li>
<li>There are lots of fun <b>perks for donors</b>! </li>

</div></div>","Short Summary Book Fight! is a weekly literature and writing podcast hosted by Mike Ingram and Tom McAllister, both of whom are writers, college professors, and editors at Barrelhouse magazine. Every Monday since April 2012, we've posted a new ~60-90 minute episode for free.  All 100+ episodes in the archive have remained free to download.
In a review of the show, The AV Club wrote:
""Overall, Book Fight! tends to be an enjoyable chat with two dudes who get passionate about the craft, call out authors on their bullshit, shout-out great lit when they read it, and consume a lot of pop culture. Book club with these guys isn’t the tedious chore it can be when sitting around the living room of someone you don’t even like, drinking bad wine. Sometimes they fight. ""
We love doing the show and have a ton of fun doing it, but it is a lot of work and there are ongoing expenses. We're asking regular listeners (and new listeners who want to support independent voices in literature) to donate to the show so that we can keep it going, continue improving it, and keep it free to download each week. 
We hope you'll consider your donation a small subscription fee for the 60+ hours of free entertainment we upload every week. Your donations will help us to finance equipment upgrades, cover ongoing administrative costs, and (we hope) pay for more live shows on the road. 

What We Need & What You Get
 This year, we're trying to raise $5,000. Any progress toward this ultimate goal will help us to achieve a number of incremental goals:  
Paying ongoing administrative costs: web hosting on Wordpress and file hosting on Libsyn, plus the cost of new books (only one book in the show's history has been sent as a review copy, and while we like throwing our money at authors and publishers--especially independent publishers--this is an out-of-pocket cost that does add up). 
Equipment upgrades: we'd love to get a fourth microphone so we can accommodate an extra guest from time to time, and also higher quality mics to improve sound quality on the show. We'd also like to get equipment to improve our mobile recording capabilities so that we can accommodate guests who can't make it to New Jersey to record. This would widen our range of possible guests and allow us to bring more new and exciting voices to the show.

Live shows on the road! We love the community that has sprung up around this show and we'd really like to bring the show out to our fans. This past year, we hosted our first live show here in Philadelphia, and we'd love to do live shows in other cities--including yours. But touring costs a lot of money, and we are far from rich! Note that this is probably the biggest expense on this list.
Any cash left over will be treated as a (small) salary for our work on the show, which is posted free and receives no ad revenue of any kind. 
There are lots of fun perks for donors! 

If we reach our goal of $5000, we'll record another bonus episode based on a book chosen by our listeners. Last year, you voted for us to discuss Silver Linings Playbook, in an episode that turned out to be a fan favorite. What will it be this year? 
Because Book Fight is an offshoot of Barrelhouse, a registered 501 (c)(3) non-profit literary publisher, your donation is 100% tax deductible.     The Impact We've been doing this show for a while now, and we think our track record speaks for itself.

Look, we don't want to overstate our importance, but there's a great value to having independent literary voices in the world.

Agree or disagree with our opinions, you know you can trust our show to be a unique, honest voice in a lit world that is sometimes so concerned with politeness that it's hard to tell what's hype and what's real.    Risks & Challenges We've got a track record here.

is raising funds for a public opinion campaign to help free America from the
paralysis of political polarization

</h3>
</div><p>The Institute for Cultural Evolution (“ICE”) is focusing on the problem of political polarization
in America, and we have a plan to help depolarize the American electorate
through <i>cultural evolution</i>.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem: political
gridlock in Washington is preventing meaningful action on pressing issues we
care deeply about. Issues such as climate change, the vanishing
middle class, Federal deficits, outdated tax policy, and many others. </p>
<p>While many have lost hope, concluding that our government is controlled
by moneyed interests with no progress possible, we’re not ready to give up on
America’s democracy. But we do recognize how polarization is exacerbated by the
fact that most political issues have
now become <i>identity issues</i> wherein
the merits of policy are trumped by “tribal” loyalties. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding these
challenges, we have a realistic solution that involves fostering political
evolution for both the near term, and for the 2016 election and beyond. ICE is now
engaged in a campaign to evolve American public opinion on both the Left and the
Right by bringing forward a vision of <i>more
evolved</i> versions of both sides of the spectrum, and we're asking for your help. </p>
<p><b>What we want to do</b></p>
<p>The money we raise on Indiegogo will help us organize, promote, and
sustain our efforts to <i><b><a href=""http://www.culturalevolution.org/campaign-issues/political-polarization/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Depolarize the American mind</a></b></i>. Our strategy starts with the recognition that the
liberal/conservative polarity is an indelible feature of our body politic,
which continues to reappear in new form as society evolves. So we are fostering
<i>further evolution</i> by advancing a
vision of the “Future Right” and the “Future Left.” These more evolved
political positions will better integrate the wisdom of their opponents, while
continuing to stand for the core values that animate each side. By showing how
each side actually needs the other for its own mature expression, we can help
create a political climate in America where new agreements will become
possible.</p>
<p>Our website features a
detailed whitepaper and video presentation on our strategy, as well as a <b><a href=""http://www.culturalevolution.org/political-polarization-test/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">polarization test</a></b> that shows how <b>you</b> can become part of the solution.

Reader Awards is a <b>FEE-FREE</b> post-publication award for chapbooks, where the
award will be given to both the author and editor of the winning chapbook. TRA
began as an idea in 2015 when we noticed a deficit of reader awards for
chapbooks and a similar deficit of reader awards for editors. As we discussed
these needs in our community, we realized an additional and more prevalent need
in our community for more accessible awards. </p>
<p>We
believe it is important to acknowledge the hurdles, including submission fees,
impeding accessibility to many awards in our creative community, especially for
minority and marginalized voices. We asked ourselves: What if we could award
the special relationship between writer and editor, while pledging our
commitment to being broadly accessible within the literary community by
maintaining fee-free nominations? The answer was clear: We can. These ideas
work beautifully in tandem and you can help make it happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our
goal is to raise a minimum of $2,000 to cover the initial start-up costs: A PO
box for mail nominations, a checking account, promotional materials, and
registering for our 501c3. Additionally your contribution will go towards the
$150 prize awarded each to the editor and the author of the winning chapbook,
and will guarantee the first two years of the awards. Any additional funds
raised over $2,000 will sweeten the prize pot; we hope to surpass the $150
prize amount for our winners and demonstrate community support and commitment
to a more inclusive writer community, where we can honor the work first and
foremost. </p>
<p><span>We
know it’s not easy to get off the ground and that not-for-profits can be
tricky, but our team of volunteers knows that a more accessible award is a
necessity for our community, and that we broaden ourselves and our greater
community by giving those marginalized voices a chance to be heard and
celebrated for their works. By celebrating the partnership between editor and
writer, and the beauty that is small batch printings, we hope to foster an
increase in these beautiful works of mutual art. Sundress Publications feels
the same way, too, and has agreed to sponsor Tandem Reader Awards under their
501c3 until we have reached our funding goal, which means that your donation is
TAX DEDUCTIBLE and supported by an experienced nonprofit. <br/>
<br/>
To help further support writers, SAFTA will house the top 10 chapbooks from
each reading period at their residency at Firefly Farms in Knoxville, TN, to be
permanently housed in their libraryfor
future residents to enjoy. In the event that our fundraiser is unable to make
sufficient operating costs, funds collected will be used to fund a scholarship
for the Firefly Farms residency for marginalized voices. </span></p>

</div></div>","Tandem
Reader Awards is a FEE-FREE post-publication award for chapbooks, where the
award will be given to both the author and editor of the winning chapbook. TRA
began as an idea in 2015 when we noticed a deficit of reader awards for
chapbooks and a similar deficit of reader awards for editors. As we discussed
these needs in our community, we realized an additional and more prevalent need
in our community for more accessible awards. 
We
believe it is important to acknowledge the hurdles, including submission fees,
impeding accessibility to many awards in our creative community, especially for
minority and marginalized voices. We asked ourselves: What if we could award
the special relationship between writer and editor, while pledging our
commitment to being broadly accessible within the literary community by
maintaining fee-free nominations? The answer was clear: We can. These ideas
work beautifully in tandem and you can help make it happen.

Our
goal is to raise a minimum of $2,000 to cover the initial start-up costs: A PO
box for mail nominations, a checking account, promotional materials, and
registering for our 501c3. Additionally your contribution will go towards the
$150 prize awarded each to the editor and the author of the winning chapbook,
and will guarantee the first two years of the awards. Any additional funds
raised over $2,000 will sweeten the prize pot; we hope to surpass the $150
prize amount for our winners and demonstrate community support and commitment
to a more inclusive writer community, where we can honor the work first and
foremost. 
We
know it’s not easy to get off the ground and that not-for-profits can be
tricky, but our team of volunteers knows that a more accessible award is a
necessity for our community, and that we broaden ourselves and our greater
community by giving those marginalized voices a chance to be heard and
celebrated for their works. By celebrating the partnership between editor and
writer, and the beauty that is small batch printings, we hope to foster an
increase in these beautiful works of mutual art. Sundress Publications feels
the same way, too, and has agreed to sponsor Tandem Reader Awards under their
501c3 until we have reached our funding goal, which means that your donation is
TAX DEDUCTIBLE and supported by an experienced nonprofit. 

To help further support writers, SAFTA will house the top 10 chapbooks from
each reading period at their residency at Firefly Farms in Knoxville, TN, to be
permanently housed in their libraryfor
future residents to enjoy. In the event that our fundraiser is unable to make
sufficient operating costs, funds collected will be used to fund a scholarship
for the Firefly Farms residency for marginalized voices. 
Donating
to our campaign also has some really nice—and unique—perks! More details on
specific perks can be found at tandemreaderawards.com/2016-fundraiser.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>The Marching Women </i>is a book that explores the intersections of women and public policy. It provides insights from inspiring young women and a framework for how to get involved in politics to create positive change in our communities.<br/><br/>My name is Marisa Lemma and I am the author of <i>The Marching Women</i>. I wrote this book because I feel as though the voices of women — young women in particular — are not being heard or taken seriously in the political arena. More young women need to not just get involved in politics, but also realize that by doing this, they can have a positive impact on their communities.<br/><br/><i>The Marching Women</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to all generations of women, and explores the ways to get our newer generations actively involved in politics so that the future is in good hands.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how important young women are in public policy and how much of an impact they can actually have. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for public policy in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you use your voice to create positive change in your own communities.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about inspiring young women who have made a difference in their communities and the ways in which you, too, can make a difference. For example, you'll read stories about:<ul>
<li>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest member of the House of Representatives, who used social media to overthrow the incumbent in her district</li>
<li>Pooja Tanjore, the Virginia State Director of Rise to Run, whose main goal is to get more young women involved in politics</li>
<li>Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish activist who has forced climate change to become a worldwide policy priority</li>
</ul> You don’t have to be a young woman interested in politics to love this book. If you are passionate about empowering women or you have ever felt like your voice isn’t being heard by our politicians, this is the book for you.<br/> <h2>The Book - The Marching Women</h2> The book is written in <strong>2 Parts</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the introduction and Chapters 1-3. It includes, among other things, a brief history of women in public service and a look at what young women in particular can bring to politics.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 4-8. This section of the book is the more practical section. It provides a framework for how to get involved in politics, drawing on the experiences of those who have successfully done so. There is a chapter about starting locally, with insights from people such as Lucy Greenman and Pooja Tanjore. Another chapter focuses on the use of social media as an effective policy tool, and provides stories from people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Emma Gonzalez.<br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July 2020</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this summer</li>
</ul> When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish</li>
<li>A personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</li>
<li>Your name will appear in a special Acknowledgements section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</li>

Help lift a new literary arts organization off
the ground! Youngstown, Ohio, is a small rust belt city with a big heart. Your help will
foster a project to give Youngstown a greater voice.<br/><br/><b><h3>Why the Literary Arts?<br/>
</h3></b><p>The literary arts, music
and the visual arts generate economic activity in our region, and help make
Youngstown a great place to live. The acts of writing and reading foster
creativity, an increased understanding of self, a strengthening of community,
and a broader knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>Our programs and events
focus on many aspects of the literary arts: honing craft; publishing;
performing; and engaging with literature. We offer workshops led by skilled
writers each spring, summer and fall, for writers and readers of all ages and
experience levels. </p>
<p>We host a monthly first
Wednesday prose and poetry reading at Suzie’s Dogs &amp; Drafts in downtown Youngstown. Our
featured readers are a wonderful mix of local and regional writers. The open
mic that follows gives other writers an opportunity to share their work. <br/></p>

</h3> <p></p>
<p>Through our classes and First Wednesday 
readings we have connected with hundreds of Youngstowners interested in 
literary arts. We’re asking for your support so we can continue to reach out to a wider population in the area and to attract teachers and visiting writers who can connect with them. <br/></p>
<p>At the YSU Summer Festival of the Arts, more than 1000 people received a
 reusable tote bag (sponsored by the Green Team and Green Youngstown) 
imprinted with the winning poem in our ekphrastic poetry contest. We 
want to make more writing  that visible to the public, and invite more of 
Youngstown's diverse and talented writers to participate in our 
programs. <br/></p>

<p>*For the first 100 physical books preordered, all proceeds will go to Protect Our Winters. (POW helps passionate outdoor people protect the places and lifestyles they love from climate change.)*<br/><br/>The Changemaker Attitude is a non-fiction book that speaks to the younger generation and those scared about the future and are looking for a new mindset to tackle climate change.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to use positivity to address climate change. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the world in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you avoid the paralyzing fear traps that plague people all over the world and begin to take action!<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about young eco innovators who are changing the world:</p>

Here I will dispel myths about needing certain experiences and advantages to create meaningful change. I will also introduce characters like Hugh and Ahmed, creators of the Evocco app which allows consumers to understand the impacts of their food choices. <br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 9-15. In these chapters I will discuss some of the lessons I have learned that contribute to the changemaker attitude such as using your voice in a productive manner without adding to the noise and how to fake it til you make it. <br/> <p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Love is Bananas: Looking for Love in all the Wrong Places </i>(working title) </strong><br/><br/><i>Love is Bananas: Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places</i>. This book is about love. The confusing, gooey, odd, hard, magical, and bizarre things that have to do with love. It’s the one thing everybody wants. A business coach asked me a question seven years ago when I was at the lowest point in my life:<br/><br/>What is your definition of love? <br/><br/>It rocked my world and opened my eyes about why I was in a rut. Since then I have asked three questions to hundreds of people around the world: <br/><br/>1. What is your definition of love?<br/>2. How many times have you been in love?<br/>3. Do you love yourself? <br/><br/>From a dirty motel room in Nashville, Tennessee to a rusty taxi in Somala, I have traveled the world asking those three questions and what I found was painstakingly simple: Love is easy. <br/><br/>I have searched the world and uncovered the truth. I can’t wait until you discover it for yourself in these stories. <br/><br/>My name is Trey Humphreys, and I am the author of <i>Love is Bananas: Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places</i>. I wrote this book because I have struggled to learn about love and want it to be uncomplicated for you. Self love, romantic love, and love for life. I used to hate myself and always ran from intimate relationships. A disaster of a human being full of self-loathing, fear of commitment, hiding behind masks, and never believing in myself. I set out to change it, and this book is what I found. What I have learned on this wild journey about love has transformed my life and feelings about love...finally. <br/><br/>I have asked the same three questions to crackheads, centurions, religious leaders, and taxi drivers all over the world: </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">What is your definition of love?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">How many times have you been in love?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Do you love yourself? </p>
<p>I hope that, in reading this book, you discover that love is simple. It is right in front of you if you open your eyes and heart. Oh, that is good stuff! I should write a book. Good news...I did it.<br/><br/>In this book, you will learn how to love through narratives like:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Elizabeth, the 24-year-old homeless girl with HIV and cancer who I met in a dirty motel. We drank straight vodka as she told me her story. She never shed a tear until I asked if she loved herself. She did not, and my question broke her.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">My Yemeni guide who told me his love story as we drove through the desert in the back of a Toyota truck. He fell in love with a Canadian girl when he was 18 and planned to move to Canada and start a life with her. His father found out, burned his passport, and arranged his marriage. Now he is fighting to get his family out of Yemen. </li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Lester, the greatest best friend in the history of the world, who drove four hours to visit his buddy in prison, every week, for 30 years. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Love is Bananas</i> speaks to those who are lost and looking, wild-eyed and wandering, and huge-hearted, but overthinking. Let’s grapple with love. Let’s learn that a life we fucking love is right in front of us. People to love are right in front of us. Let’s quit eating pizza alone on Friday nights and light our lives on fire. <br/><br/>This book is for people who have been on 14 dating apps for the last five years or get anxiety looking in the mirror. This book is for people who spend more money on self-help books than dinners with friends. This book is for the purposeless, hopelessly romantic, and therapeutically exhausted. Hell, it’s for folks who just need to laugh. God knows laughter might just cure everything.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that this book forces you to open your eyes and see that love is all around us. I also want people to get drunk on wine and debate these three questions with me: </p>
<p>           What is the definition of love? </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">How do you fall in love? </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">How do you love yourself? </p>
<p>I look forward to laughing, crying, and empowering readers to become experts at love. Love is easy, and I prove it in this book. You will be the master of love, or I will sue myself. </p>
<p><strong>The Book </strong></p>
<p>I wrote the book in three parts because three is my lucky number AND the magical number of the universe. </p>
<ul><li>nds, is the jackpot. </li></ul>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>I will publish this book with New Degree Press because they are extremely smart and know more about this than me. They created programs with tiers to generate excitement while covering the publishing costs. Money raised will go toward:<br/> <ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">The Editor (or as I like to call her...therapist) - I will work with her to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2020</li>

Love is Bananas: Looking for Love in all the Wrong Places (working title) Love is Bananas: Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places. This book is about love. The confusing, gooey, odd, hard, magical, and bizarre things that have to do with love. It’s the one thing everybody wants. A business coach asked me a question seven years ago when I was at the lowest point in my life:What is your definition of love? It rocked my world and opened my eyes about why I was in a rut. Since then I have asked three questions to hundreds of people around the world: 1. What is your definition of love?2. How many times have you been in love?3. Do you love yourself? From a dirty motel room in Nashville, Tennessee to a rusty taxi in Somala, I have traveled the world asking those three questions and what I found was painstakingly simple: Love is easy. I have searched the world and uncovered the truth. I can’t wait until you discover it for yourself in these stories. My name is Trey Humphreys, and I am the author of Love is Bananas: Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places. I wrote this book because I have struggled to learn about love and want it to be uncomplicated for you. Self love, romantic love, and love for life. I used to hate myself and always ran from intimate relationships. A disaster of a human being full of self-loathing, fear of commitment, hiding behind masks, and never believing in myself. I set out to change it, and this book is what I found. What I have learned on this wild journey about love has transformed my life and feelings about love...finally. I have asked the same three questions to crackheads, centurions, religious leaders, and taxi drivers all over the world: 
What is your definition of love?
How many times have you been in love?
Do you love yourself? 
I hope that, in reading this book, you discover that love is simple. It is right in front of you if you open your eyes and heart. Oh, that is good stuff! I should write a book. Good news...I did it.In this book, you will learn how to love through narratives like:

Elizabeth, the 24-year-old homeless girl with HIV and cancer who I met in a dirty motel. We drank straight vodka as she told me her story. She never shed a tear until I asked if she loved herself. She did not, and my question broke her.
My Yemeni guide who told me his love story as we drove through the desert in the back of a Toyota truck. He fell in love with a Canadian girl when he was 18 and planned to move to Canada and start a life with her. His father found out, burned his passport, and arranged his marriage. Now he is fighting to get his family out of Yemen. 
Lester, the greatest best friend in the history of the world, who drove four hours to visit his buddy in prison, every week, for 30 years. 

Love is Bananas speaks to those who are lost and looking, wild-eyed and wandering, and huge-hearted, but overthinking. Let’s grapple with love. Let’s learn that a life we fucking love is right in front of us. People to love are right in front of us. Let’s quit eating pizza alone on Friday nights and light our lives on fire. This book is for people who have been on 14 dating apps for the last five years or get anxiety looking in the mirror. This book is for people who spend more money on self-help books than dinners with friends. This book is for the purposeless, hopelessly romantic, and therapeutically exhausted. Hell, it’s for folks who just need to laugh. God knows laughter might just cure everything.Ultimately, I hope that this book forces you to open your eyes and see that love is all around us. I also want people to get drunk on wine and debate these three questions with me: 
           What is the definition of love? 
How do you fall in love? 
How do you love yourself? 
I look forward to laughing, crying, and empowering readers to become experts at love. Love is easy, and I prove it in this book. You will be the master of love, or I will sue myself. 
The Book 
I wrote the book in three parts because three is my lucky number AND the magical number of the universe. 
nds, is the jackpot.

It goes through, step-by-step, what we need to do right now to avert the crisis.<br/><br/>My name is Samuel Goodman and I am the author of <i>Beyond Carbon Neutral</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to prove there is a solution to this monumental problem and understand what the implications of that solution mean for not only the future of energy, but for society as a whole.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll discover that there is still hope for solving climate change. In this book, I hope to both instill in you the passion and clarity that I have for tackling such a major problem. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you gain the understanding you need to advocate for the future you want to build, free of a looming catastrophe.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about building a carbon-free power grid with the tools we have right now, reversing damage to the climate by taking carbon out of the atmosphere, and changing societal institutions to make those achievements happen. You'll hear about things like:</p><p>Making intermittent renewables like solar and wind provide constant energy year-round;</p><p>Rebuilding our forests and oceans to permanently store carbon dioxide;</p><p>Ways to use the powers of business and government to make change happen;</p><p>How you can get involved and make choices that make a difference.</p><p>You will love this book if you are concerned about the future because of climate change, want to know how to fix it, and want to know what you can do about it.<br/><br/>Beyond Carbon Neutral is a nonfiction book that speaks to everyone concerned about climate change. It’s designed to give someone the information they’ll need, whether they’re just entering the topic or a veteran looking for new insights and a concrete plan.<br/> </p><p><strong>The Book - Beyond Carbon Neutral</strong></p><p><br/>The book is written in 5 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction and chapter 1. This section lays the groundwork for the rest of the book. The introduction presents the stakes we’re dealing with and the failure to respond to that challenge. In chapter 1, the book defines how we’re going to approach solving this problem by defining the terms of our climate strategy.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 2-8. This part of the book is all about how to re-build our power grid using renewable energy sources. Critically, it details how to solve the problem of making all these different sources of energy work together without the need for any fossil fuels.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 9-12. These chapters discuss the other half of mitigating climate change—pulling carbon out of the atmosphere. The reader will be walked through the different options available, and be able to decide which ones actually make sense for permanently reversing the damage that’s been done.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains chapters 13-16. The final four chapters discuss how we can implement the changes we need using the institutions available to us in society. This part lays out the role that business, government, and you, the reader, will play in making this effort successful.<br/><br/><strong>Part 5</strong> pulls together everything discussed in the book and presents it as a coherent strategy for solving climate change with timelines and deliverables we can follow to solve this problem.<br/><br/> </p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

It goes through, step-by-step, what we need to do right now to avert the crisis.My name is Samuel Goodman and I am the author of Beyond Carbon Neutral. I wrote this book because I wanted to prove there is a solution to this monumental problem and understand what the implications of that solution mean for not only the future of energy, but for society as a whole.My hope is that, in reading this book, you’ll discover that there is still hope for solving climate change. In this book, I hope to both instill in you the passion and clarity that I have for tackling such a major problem. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you gain the understanding you need to advocate for the future you want to build, free of a looming catastrophe.In this book, you'll learn about building a carbon-free power grid with the tools we have right now, reversing damage to the climate by taking carbon out of the atmosphere, and changing societal institutions to make those achievements happen. You'll hear about things like:Making intermittent renewables like solar and wind provide constant energy year-round;Rebuilding our forests and oceans to permanently store carbon dioxide;Ways to use the powers of business and government to make change happen;How you can get involved and make choices that make a difference.You will love this book if you are concerned about the future because of climate change, want to know how to fix it, and want to know what you can do about it.Beyond Carbon Neutral is a nonfiction book that speaks to everyone concerned about climate change. It’s designed to give someone the information they’ll need, whether they’re just entering the topic or a veteran looking for new insights and a concrete plan. The Book - Beyond Carbon NeutralThe book is written in 5 parts.Part 1 contains the introduction and chapter 1. This section lays the groundwork for the rest of the book. The introduction presents the stakes we’re dealing with and the failure to respond to that challenge. In chapter 1, the book defines how we’re going to approach solving this problem by defining the terms of our climate strategy.Part 2 contains chapters 2-8. This part of the book is all about how to re-build our power grid using renewable energy sources. Critically, it details how to solve the problem of making all these different sources of energy work together without the need for any fossil fuels.Part 3 contains chapters 9-12. These chapters discuss the other half of mitigating climate change—pulling carbon out of the atmosphere. The reader will be walked through the different options available, and be able to decide which ones actually make sense for permanently reversing the damage that’s been done.Part 4 contains chapters 13-16. The final four chapters discuss how we can implement the changes we need using the institutions available to us in society. This part lays out the role that business, government, and you, the reader, will play in making this effort successful.Part 5 pulls together everything discussed in the book and presents it as a coherent strategy for solving climate change with timelines and deliverables we can follow to solve this problem. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:
The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021.
The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)
The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this April 2021.
When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition.

<h4>My book's title: <i>Core Star Matrix Healing...</i>

I quit my day job, and am devoting myself to what matters – Love, Family, and <i>the work.</i></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Time to get busy!

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Publicists, publishing, shipping costs, and just living, plus 2 kids in college and one about to enter - boy costs add up quickly.

A secondary goal is to record an audio version of the book which will entail recording studio fees. PR plus fees for equipment to get the word out now is a critical aspect of my goal. I don't know if I will find a publisher! I haven't even looked yet, but I know that Balboa press is an option – and <i>I've always felt it's in God's hands,</i> and will find its way. My plan: help a new generation of healers (and those who want to be healed – and stay healthy) to have access to how these Energy systems connect.</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span></p><p></p><p></p><h3>

</p><p><i>As a child my mom had to deal with my consistent curiosity (Sorry Mom!) – and they said I was always saying ""Why?"" about just about everything. Also, although for many years I assumed everyone was the same as me, I knew/ ""saw"" past lives, knew what others were thinking (well - they'd say it soon after I internally heard it/clair-audient), and often had information, that I had no way of knowing... it would just come out of my mouth! I joke that I am a Spirit savant. I am also empathic, kinesthetic (I feel other's feelings and emotions, and life, deeply), and am dyslexic - this means that I see in pictures from many angles, and I also experience life in a very multi-sensory way, even as synesthesia. <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>     </i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/377764/files/20140218085320-hummingbird-small.jpg?1392742400"" src="""" style=""width: 65.17241379310344px; height: 54px;""/></i></p><i>I was never bored, spoke with Nature, animals, bees. Life was a beautiful, magical place for me as a child. </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Since I can remember, I've been fascinated with why and how we respond to life, life beyond this life, how we experience trauma (emotional pain), how we heal, and learning about what really matters, LOVE. I read about many cultures, was fascinated with Edgar Cayce, played classical guitar, and acted in, and directed many high school plays!</span><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I began my young adult life with the study of Acting at Rutgers University in their BFA program. I became more curious about the psyche, and was intrigued with the drama of BEING, what being healthy, and healing means –  understanding why we think what we do, and where these thoughts and feelings originate. There while practicing Alexander Technique, and just walking with a friend, I had a major past life memory of being guillotined. This shocking experience made me very curious, once again. Later, I met my husband in a lecture on healing at a channeler's loft in the Village of NYC, and in 1987, I studied Reiki which is basically opening up to healing energy in Chakras, and feels like ""good vibes"" – and it's the science of passing down this knowledge. As I first began to put hands on clients, I found I got information that was very personal about why they had physical pain, blocks or any discomfort at the emotional level as well. Reiki felt great, but did not cure my health issues. I later found out why – and I learned how to listen well, and shift the pain into a healing release, creating harmony on all levels. Many years later, 2008, I trained with Brian Weiss in Past Life Regression.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I'm a mom of 3, married to my best friend and husband of 27 years. I know how life can throw you for a loop, and have had my own share of trauma (haven't we all?). Yes, the answer is, 100% of humans have experienced trauma! I had therapy, but it did not clear the deepest signals of trauma (beyond this life), and I experienced immune system dysfunction as a young adult, which first showed up as chronic fatigue. I felt like there was a toxin in my body that I didn't know how to remove. There was, and I later found out about </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">how trauma affects the body</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> with leaky gut syndrome, and exactly how that feels. It's a precursor to Lupus, Fibromyalgia, MS, and a host of other diagnoses.  </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">   </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">                            </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/378944/files/20140218180917-BizCard_2012_outlines.jpg?1392775757"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center; width: 257.544px; height: 147px;""/></p><p>In the '90's living in Los Angeles, I found a Dr. of Chinese Medicine, and my husband and I were able to conceive after 5 years of no success (and trying conventional methods of fertility specialists). Later, a homeopath, MD, acupuncturist named Dr. Luc DeSchepper helped me clear the Candida, and create a healthy gut. Going through that process, I re-experienced traumas and began to heal. I still had many hurdles ahead of me at the time. I worked in the health food industry, so had access to cutting edge nutrition and supplement information, and I read every book on immune system~healing I could find. For several years, I also was an improv actor in grant-funded  programs in schools – helping children to feel empowered and address trauma issues. From those years, a calling to learn more about psychology grew. For 8 years my dream was on the back burner, as I learned a wealth of information, worked hard in the Nutrition industry – and we raised our young children. In '98, we moved to Savannah to be near family, my daughter entered pre-K, and I ""synchronistically"" found a program that led me to being a licensed psychotherapist. It was time.</p>
<p>The upshot: jump to 25 years later. When my daughter entered Pre-K in 1999, I entered a graduate program! I became a Licensed Therapist (2001), and then added certified Reiki Master, Yoga teacher, EMDR, and Advanced Energy Medicine practitioner and past life Regression therapist (I studied early on, briefly, with Caroline Myss, and later with a Cherokee Medicine man in Taos NM; Dr. Brian Weiss at the Omega Institute ('08), and Donna Eden~Innersource EM Advanced work, and was a work scholar for 6 years at NICABM annual conferences to 2011). Chinese Medicine (means Meridians: what acupuncturists work with; the 5 Elements; and Radiant Circuits – these reflect organ health, and access emotional health in the body). Ayurvedic tradition discusses 'Chakras' (or Soul Stories: how we orient to Spirituality, intuition, communication, Love, truth &amp; integrity, being a creator &amp; creating, Earth connection – within ourselves and with others). </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/376798/files/20140217203929-imgeem1.jpg?1392698369"" src="""" style=""width: 278.76305220883535px; height: 259px;""/>      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/376803/files/20140217203957-igeem2.jpg?1392698397"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 246.73316708229427px; height: 291px;""/><br/></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>I found that as I worked with my clients, I saw more specifically into these Energy Systems, and the ""emotional splatter"" left by ""emotional splinters"" in what I came to see as the ""containment fields"" of the Chakras.<i> The new system emerged, that I came to call ""Core star Matrix Healing"" which shows a  3-point connection (in what I call the Spirit Dan Tiens), between these ancient healing systems from China and India. I found my clients healed quicker and more thoroughly from issues that other cognitive talk therapies for many years had not cleared.</i><i> <b>I discovered in partnership with Spirit, many exercises that turned out to help my clients.</b> I used them and found them helpful too, but if my clients hadn't validated the findings, it would've been without merit.

Thanks for watching my video! 

Our ultimate choice, FEAR (Body) vs. LOVE (Spirit) – learn how to awaken to your Divine potential! This work is my mission in life! I see how we experience trauma, fear, stuck emotions – and how we can be in harmony. Meridians (Body and Emotions) intersect via specific points, with Chakras (Satellites of the Soul); when healthy, these anchor into our Divine spark, the Core Star of the CS Matrix system (which includes Chakras and what I call Core Star Matrix Lines, which are at the deepest level. They stabilize the Chakras, and each have a specific function – when strong, a 3rd eye upgrade occurs). This is what I've consistently seen in thousands of sessions! My Background...This project is many years – if not life times in the making. My work as a Licensed Counselor, Advanced practitioner of Energy Medicine, and Intuitive, has been an amazing journey of discovery. I ""see"" trauma, how energy flows, and the stories embedded within the energy systems... the ability and breadth of which I was not initially aware I even had! Time is of the essence!!! I leave Savannah in May to move to NYC. My goal: I will raise funds to write my book, this Autumn (once my daughter graduates from high school and enters college!). I'll share how these Energy systems interact; teaching the exercises (I have 3 laminates, but there are more!). Feel more centered and able to not take on others' pain; learn how we're all wired for the Divine. 
My book's title: Core Star Matrix Healing...

I am seeing new information: a new interface of the Core Star, plus easy exercises that Spirit showed me, which complement any approach you've ever used. I will provide tools to access each layer; and to understand how trauma affects you now – and how you can heal in body, mind and Spirit. See my website for more info, www.ellenfarrell.comI am not getting any younger folks! With my father's passing last December I knew it was time for me to speed up the meeting of my contract – my life's work. As I sat with this, having seen him in and out of his body, at the portal, and after, I contemplated why I am here (on Earth). I quit my day job, and am devoting myself to what matters – Love, Family, and the work.Time to get busy! I wrote an outline and did the research... it's time to share what I know. I hope you will find my vision meaningful – and will help me gain the resources, to get the ball rolling to write the book! 

Here's the Deal... 
Publicists, publishing, shipping costs, and just living, plus 2 kids in college and one about to enter - boy costs add up quickly. Seeing clients non-stop, I find it impossible to write. Living and not having to worry about having money for my next meal will be a huge help. Pricing: I've found ranges from 2 thousand to 8K for publishing alone. A secondary goal is to record an audio version of the book which will entail recording studio fees. PR plus fees for equipment to get the word out now is a critical aspect of my goal. I don't know if I will find a publisher! I haven't even looked yet, but I know that Balboa press is an option – and I've always felt it's in God's hands, and will find its way. My plan: help a new generation of healers (and those who want to be healed – and stay healthy) to have access to how these Energy systems connect. 
 Why a Book?...
We're talking about the ultimate aligning of body and soul - spirit infused into form. What connects us is LOVE. Until we feel it we will continue endlessly acting out dramas of fear and reactivity, and habits of survival. But we are Angels on Earth, here to learn about love, and being our best – when we understand what we're made of, I believe, and HAVE SEEN, that we feel better; more present, aware, happy, empowered... and we do better.I know it can get confusing to read conflicting information online, and all I can say is the seers of old are being quoted, and at times mis-quoted – and that the information and systems themselves, like us, are evolving. I can only report what I see (and feel, sense, hear, etc.), and that my clients agree it is correct. It's been reaffirming to hear my clients support – and their questions and desire for a book (and meditation CD's, DVD's, maybe another book about Past Lives, and my experiences with healing Immune system issues, etc.) to reference all we have done – and also it's been a supreme blessing to see their growth. One of my favorite sayings is ""If of thy store 2 loaves of bread alone remain, sell one, and with the dole, buy hyacinths to feed thy soul.""                                                            I will use whatever funds I get toward this goal. If I meet or exceed my goal I pay 4% – if I do not meet my goal, I pay 9% to Indiegogo, so obviously, I hope to exceed my goal! Most important is that the knowledge is shared!If you have any extra ""dole"", please help me fund my vision of sharing the gift of this work to help us awaken, evolve, transcend fear, and heal – so you will be able ""to feed your soul"" ...and all souls, and the planet, will benefit.Please help me to keep moving forward... contribute, and share this campaign with friends and family in Facebook, Twitter, and email! Share a lot, and fear not!!! Listen to your inner voice, and please use the Indiegogo share tools!!! If you have any questions, please email me, ellen@ellenfarrell.com, or message me on Facebook! I have only a few spots for clients left - call and we can schedule you for right after St. Patty's day!
 How Ellen's work evolved... 

As a child my mom had to deal with my consistent curiosity (Sorry Mom!) – and they said I was always saying ""Why?"" about just about everything. Also, although for many years I assumed everyone was the same as me, I knew/ ""saw"" past lives, knew what others were thinking (well - they'd say it soon after I internally heard it/clair-audient), and often had information, that I had no way of knowing... it would just come out of my mouth! I joke that I am a Spirit savant. I am also empathic, kinesthetic (I feel other's feelings and emotions, and life, deeply), and am dyslexic - this means that I see in pictures from many angles, and I also experience life in a very multi-sensory way, even as synesthesia.      I was never bored, spoke with Nature, animals, bees. Life was a beautiful, magical place for me as a child. Since I can remember, I've been fascinated with why and how we respond to life, life beyond this life, how we experience trauma (emotional pain), how we heal, and learning about what really matters, LOVE. I read about many cultures, was fascinated with Edgar Cayce, played classical guitar, and acted in, and directed many high school plays!I began my young adult life with the study of Acting at Rutgers University in their BFA program. I became more curious about the psyche, and was intrigued with the drama of BEING, what being healthy, and healing means –  understanding why we think what we do, and where these thoughts and feelings originate. There while practicing Alexander Technique, and just walking with a friend, I had a major past life memory of being guillotined. This shocking experience made me very curious, once again. Later, I met my husband in a lecture on healing at a channeler's loft in the Village of NYC, and in 1987, I studied Reiki which is basically opening up to healing energy in Chakras, and feels like ""good vibes"" – and it's the science of passing down this knowledge. As I first began to put hands on clients, I found I got information that was very personal about why they had physical pain, blocks or any discomfort at the emotional level as well. Reiki felt great, but did not cure my health issues. I later found out why – and I learned how to listen well, and shift the pain into a healing release, creating harmony on all levels. Many years later, 2008, I trained with Brian Weiss in Past Life Regression.I'm a mom of 3, married to my best friend and husband of 27 years. I know how life can throw you for a loop, and have had my own share of trauma (haven't we all?). Yes, the answer is, 100% of humans have experienced trauma! I had therapy, but it did not clear the deepest signals of trauma (beyond this life), and I experienced immune system dysfunction as a young adult, which first showed up as chronic fatigue. I felt like there was a toxin in my body that I didn't know how to remove. There was, and I later found out about how trauma affects the body with leaky gut syndrome, and exactly how that feels. It's a precursor to Lupus, Fibromyalgia, MS, and a host of other diagnoses.                                 In the '90's living in Los Angeles, I found a Dr. of Chinese Medicine, and my husband and I were able to conceive after 5 years of no success (and trying conventional methods of fertility specialists). Later, a homeopath, MD, acupuncturist named Dr. Luc DeSchepper helped me clear the Candida, and create a healthy gut. Going through that process, I re-experienced traumas and began to heal. I still had many hurdles ahead of me at the time. I worked in the health food industry, so had access to cutting edge nutrition and supplement information, and I read every book on immune system~healing I could find. For several years, I also was an improv actor in grant-funded  programs in schools – helping children to feel empowered and address trauma issues. From those years, a calling to learn more about psychology grew. For 8 years my dream was on the back burner, as I learned a wealth of information, worked hard in the Nutrition industry – and we raised our young children. In '98, we moved to Savannah to be near family, my daughter entered pre-K, and I ""synchronistically"" found a program that led me to being a licensed psychotherapist. It was time.
The upshot: jump to 25 years later. When my daughter entered Pre-K in 1999, I entered a graduate program! I became a Licensed Therapist (2001), and then added certified Reiki Master, Yoga teacher, EMDR, and Advanced Energy Medicine practitioner and past life Regression therapist (I studied early on, briefly, with Caroline Myss, and later with a Cherokee Medicine man in Taos NM; Dr. Brian Weiss at the Omega Institute ('08), and Donna Eden~Innersource EM Advanced work, and was a work scholar for 6 years at NICABM annual conferences to 2011). Chinese Medicine (means Meridians: what acupuncturists work with; the 5 Elements; and Radiant Circuits – these reflect organ health, and access emotional health in the body). Ayurvedic tradition discusses 'Chakras' (or Soul Stories: how we orient to Spirituality, intuition, communication, Love, truth & integrity, being a creator & creating, Earth connection – within ourselves and with others).       
I found that as I worked with my clients, I saw more specifically into these Energy Systems, and the ""emotional splatter"" left by ""emotional splinters"" in what I came to see as the ""containment fields"" of the Chakras. The new system emerged, that I came to call ""Core star Matrix Healing"" which shows a  3-point connection (in what I call the Spirit Dan Tiens), between these ancient healing systems from China and India. I found my clients healed quicker and more thoroughly from issues that other cognitive talk therapies for many years had not cleared. I discovered in partnership with Spirit, many exercises that turned out to help my clients. I used them and found them helpful too, but if my clients hadn't validated the findings, it would've been without merit. I'm a skeptic at heart, who also happens to have found out I am highly intuitive, and kinesthetic. I want the world at large to know how trauma, and this deeper Energy system works (and how it leads to a strong foundation and upgrade for the 3rd eye), from someone who has been there and healed. 
Here I am, April, 2012, at the 5th Biennial Cultural Competency Conference at GA State University, where I was chosen to present a Poster session: Awakening to the Energies that unite us…   a new
culture of Oneness. Deepak Chopra was their Keynote speaker.Reiki, Yoga & Meditation, breath work  Affirmations/Positive thinking – all of these things are good, important, and helpful. None of them give us full access to directly and thoroughly reach/heal the original wound. If the signal is still there we are not functioning at our full potential. Cognitive therapy, EMDR/EFT, kinesiology, even Regression may – or may not get to the deepest layers of trauma (I do these modalities). But it does not teach you how to work with your own energies to stay strong, and clear. Also, the tricky thing about trauma is that it's hidden in the subconscious. If we don't ask the best questions, we don't get the best answers.This kind of information used to be taught in secret societies... we don't have time for that now. We need to wake up. Control, greed, and fear are trauma responses that are leading to destruction of our Heaven on Earth potential. I teach how to access the deepest layers of your own energy systems so we can thrive, and reverse damage that has been done. You still may need a skilled clinician/practitioner for support especially with chronic/severe issues, but either way, you will have access to a deeper template of healing that will change you for the better – it will empower you, and help you take a fast track to evolve your Soul! Thank-you, and many blessings of health, love, peace, wisdom, and joy to you and yours.  Love, EllenI've completed 2 books of poetry both about 70 pp. each (Stories from my Heart ...Spirit-infused Wisdom Poetry, and Pregnant Poems ...for families of all kinds), and am working on editing the 3rd, Merging with the Divine, a more personal and larger compilation.

We aim to critically and creatively examine the facets of this country that either don’t get enough time in mainstream media, or haven't been discussed in broad ways. We do this with word counts that run into the thousands, allowing our stories depth and context.In our past two issues, we have explored LAN shop culture, Teochew puppetry, bomohs, Singapore soap operas, Traditional Chinese Medicine and more.**A spread of ""Three Recipes for the Singapore Sling"" by Joel Tan**What's in Mynah #3?
A look at the origins of the Singapore Sling through three different recipes and how it became the bland tourist trap it is today
Speculative vignettes of an alternative Singapore where British colonialism never happened
An essay on the parallels of Samsui women and modern-day migrant workers, and what they tell us about labour, gender and race
An exploration of translation in Singapore that examines 1950s Malayan multilingual films and installation art
An analysis of Singlish and the linguistic face of settler colonialism
A conversation between Amanda Lee Koe and Jeremy Tiang on translation
A gorgeously styled photo essay of customised, or zhnged, instant noodle recipes
And more!
We pride ourselves on being a magazine with a diversity of voices, and in Mynah #3 we're proud to feature the work of emerging writers like Natalie Christian Tan and Gregory Ng Yong He, and seasoned contributors like Joel Tan and Nuraliah Norasid, just to name a few.**A spread of ""Mee Zhng"" by various contributors**Why Mynah? Mynah began because we saw a gap in the publishing landscape where in-depth Singapore stories should’ve been. We wanted to carve out a space where stories could plumb Singapore’s depths and explore the timbres and textures of our country the mainstream media does not cover. We also wanted Mynah to be a space for the architects of these stories—writers, illustrators, photographers and more—to be in conversation with each other.We’ve published two issues so far to great reception, a validation of our belief that there is a demand for intelligent longform writing about Singapore.

<h3><span>A BIG heartfelt Thank You to everyone who contributed to the campaign and helped us reach our initial goal in the first day!</span></h3>
<h3>Many of you sent books to male friends; several to prisons. </h3>
<div>
<h3>The main focus of this campaign going forward is to support as many men as possible in waking up emotionally to create a safer world for all of us. Whether these men are in prison, your life, or in your workplace, please support our goal for the remainder of the campaign to IMPACT at least 2000 men with 2000 books! </h3>
<p>SPREAD THE WORD!</p>
<div> </div>
<div>* * *</div>
</div>
<p>I’m on a mission to inspire my brothers to get our act together. You don’t need to see statistics to know men in all levels of society (bankers to bums) are messing up, whether they realize it or not. They’re acting out in stupid, selfish ways for reasons they often don’t fully understand and making life miserable for themselves and those who try to love them. Men in prison have to risk death, become fully accountable for their actions and responsible for their own healing before starting to live fuller lives.  Men on the outside are imprisoned by emotional immaturity and lack of accountability that dearly cost them and the ones they love. <strong>Support our vision of providing one million men in crisis the practical guidance, tools, and inspiration they need so they can prevent and resolve conflict in their homes, workplaces, and communities.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, ladies some of us, and hopefully soon a lot more of us, want to be real men. </p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>When you ask how he is and a man says “fine”, he really means Frightened, Isolated, Neurotic and Emotionally unavailable. (FINE)</em></strong></p>
<p>This campaign is for those of us seeking a safer world. We are coming together to co-write a powerful, persuasive book and get it into the hands of men in crisis everywhere. We will Crowd-Author a book and SEND IT TO PRISONS, BOARDROOMS AND CONGRESS, SO MEN WHO NEED IT CAN READ IT. Pledge and send a book to your boss, your buddy, your family member who needs to <em>“Wake Up, Man Up, Step Up.”</em>  The book is described as: “a treasure map (for men) that if followed will lead you to your best self. It will help you see that the journey inside yourself is where the freedom is. Around the world, our communities - our men, women, and children need us to wake-up and step-up.” </p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>What’s the difference between men and government bonds? Bonds eventually mature. (To be politically correct, there are many mature men, just not enough)</em></strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, for many men it takes a crisis like divorce, illness, losing their job or the death of a parent to get them to look inside. It was divorce for me. It woke me up and put me on this path to becoming an <strong>Integrative Coach</strong> with a law degree and certifications in money coaching, life planning, belief processing, as well as several years of facilitation and leadership training.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>When women are depressed, they call a girlfriend. When men are depressed, they call for a war. (And yes, we are aware those are stereotypes)</em></strong></p>
<p>I’m sure our co-authored book will work if we can get men to use it. They’ll come to understand why they do the things that DON’T WORK for them and learn how to start doing things that DO WORK. Too many men live stuck in unconscious patterns and wind up incarcerated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Help me get the book into the hands of men in prisons before they come back out still confused and angry.</li>
<li>Help me get it to those men of power and privilege whose fear comes out as cruelty, corruption, war and winner-take-all callousness.</li>
<li>Help yourself and the men in your life by getting this book into their hands!</li>

<p><strong>Your stories matter!</strong></p>
<p>Virtually every woman has been emotionally, physically or verbally abused by a man during her life, yet often they haven’t had a chance to speak up.<strong><em> Their stories should be told, and with your help we will include them in the new book</em></strong>. People need to see and feel what’s happening. Men need to understand the damage they’re doing by staying asleep. Almost every man reading this KNOWS or at least senses he could do better. </p>
<p>You as a man may have been emotionally, physically, or verbally abused and haven't had a chance to speak up. We want to hear from you too.</p>
<p>Pledge, so men get tools for manning up.</p>

</div></div>","CAMPAIGN UPRATE:
A BIG heartfelt Thank You to everyone who contributed to the campaign and helped us reach our initial goal in the first day!
Many of you sent books to male friends; several to prisons. 

The main focus of this campaign going forward is to support as many men as possible in waking up emotionally to create a safer world for all of us. Whether these men are in prison, your life, or in your workplace, please support our goal for the remainder of the campaign to IMPACT at least 2000 men with 2000 books! 
SPREAD THE WORD!
 
* * *

I’m on a mission to inspire my brothers to get our act together. You don’t need to see statistics to know men in all levels of society (bankers to bums) are messing up, whether they realize it or not. They’re acting out in stupid, selfish ways for reasons they often don’t fully understand and making life miserable for themselves and those who try to love them. Men in prison have to risk death, become fully accountable for their actions and responsible for their own healing before starting to live fuller lives.  Men on the outside are imprisoned by emotional immaturity and lack of accountability that dearly cost them and the ones they love. Support our vision of providing one million men in crisis the practical guidance, tools, and inspiration they need so they can prevent and resolve conflict in their homes, workplaces, and communities.
Yes, ladies some of us, and hopefully soon a lot more of us, want to be real men. 
When you ask how he is and a man says “fine”, he really means Frightened, Isolated, Neurotic and Emotionally unavailable. (FINE)
This campaign is for those of us seeking a safer world. We are coming together to co-write a powerful, persuasive book and get it into the hands of men in crisis everywhere. We will Crowd-Author a book and SEND IT TO PRISONS, BOARDROOMS AND CONGRESS, SO MEN WHO NEED IT CAN READ IT. Pledge and send a book to your boss, your buddy, your family member who needs to “Wake Up, Man Up, Step Up.”  The book is described as: “a treasure map (for men) that if followed will lead you to your best self. It will help you see that the journey inside yourself is where the freedom is. Around the world, our communities - our men, women, and children need us to wake-up and step-up.” 
What’s the difference between men and government bonds? Bonds eventually mature. (To be politically correct, there are many mature men, just not enough)
Unfortunately, for many men it takes a crisis like divorce, illness, losing their job or the death of a parent to get them to look inside. It was divorce for me. It woke me up and put me on this path to becoming an Integrative Coach with a law degree and certifications in money coaching, life planning, belief processing, as well as several years of facilitation and leadership training.
When women are depressed, they call a girlfriend. When men are depressed, they call for a war. (And yes, we are aware those are stereotypes)
I’m sure our co-authored book will work if we can get men to use it. They’ll come to understand why they do the things that DON’T WORK for them and learn how to start doing things that DO WORK. Too many men live stuck in unconscious patterns and wind up incarcerated.

Help me get the book into the hands of men in prisons before they come back out still confused and angry.
Help me get it to those men of power and privilege whose fear comes out as cruelty, corruption, war and winner-take-all callousness.
Help yourself and the men in your life by getting this book into their hands!
 

Your stories matter!
Virtually every woman has been emotionally, physically or verbally abused by a man during her life, yet often they haven’t had a chance to speak up. Their stories should be told, and with your help we will include them in the new book. People need to see and feel what’s happening. Men need to understand the damage they’re doing by staying asleep. Almost every man reading this KNOWS or at least senses he could do better. 
You as a man may have been emotionally, physically, or verbally abused and haven't had a chance to speak up. We want to hear from you too.
Pledge, so men get tools for manning up.
How the Money will be Used:
We're raising the money to produce and distribute books that include the stories of those who need to be heard. We’ll spend what’s contributed on:

Layout & editing
Promotion of the cause
Printing
Distribution
Wake Up, men! It’s time for us men to stop running away from our responsibility.
Man Up! It’s time to heal ourselves and create peace and prosperity for women and children.  
Step up! I’m asking you, men and women, to share your stories, photos, poetry, art and ideas around the effects men have had on your world and in the lives of your friends, families, and children.
 
now... THE REWARDS:
Pledge $5 or more. 
WITH YOU IN MORE THAN JUST SPIRIT. Stand up and be counted as willing to take a stand against violence in our world. Men commit ninety percent of violent crime, often because they suffered as children and never were taught how to handle their feelings. Let your dollar be a gesture of compassion so boys will learn how to live love.
Pledge $15 or more.
CO-AUTHOR THE NEW BOOK. Nominate your story, photo, poetry or art for inclusion in the CROWD-AUTHORED book. Whether your story is included in the book or not your name will be listed on a special thank you page in the book. Please follow these submission guidelines. 
Pledge $25 or more.
GET THE BOOK FOR SOMEONE WHO REALLY NEEDS A WAKE UP KICK IN THE ASS, LIKE YOUR BOSS, PARTNER, HUSBAND, EX-HUSBAND, BOYFRIEND OR YOURSELF. If you know a man you believe is ready to “Wake Up, Man Up, Step Up” we’ll send the 1st edition anonymously with a note that says “Someone in your life believes in you enough to buy you this book. They know you’re ready to “Wake Up, Man Up, Step Up” in your life and that your world, and theirs, will be better after you do.” (Digital version available)
Pledge $80 or more.
FOR WOMEN: ANSWER YOUR OWN WAKE CALL, STEP UP IN YOUR WOMAN’S POWER AND BECOME AN EFFECTIVE COACH FOR YOUR MAN. Get the 1st edition of the book and a spot for yourself in an ARATAcode two month online video course. Receive coaching from Ray to get your husband or lover to show up in your life in a way you’ve always wanted. If he’s facing his “wake up” call, currently in crisis or you’re having your own wake up and have decided something has to change “or else”, coaching can help. If you’re patient, you don’t try to rescue him (or let him off the hook) and he does his emotional work he might be able to show up in your life in a way you always knew was possible.
Pledge $200 or more.
SET UP YOUR OWN SUPPORT GROUP – A PEACE (AND PIZZA) COMBO. You’ll receive FOUR COPIES of the hardcover 1ST edition of “Wake Up, Man Up, Step Up” as well as a Support Group Starter Kit explaining how to set up your men’s support group.  Give a book to three friends, form a quartet, keep each other accountable and see your lives transformed by using the ARATA code of conduct. You’ll also receive a pizza with the message “I’m for peace and pizza in my world” spelled out in olives, mushrooms or sausage, and delivered to your door to kick off your first meeting. Two additional books will be sent to a prison in your name.
Pledge $250 or more.
SEND HELP TO MEN IN CRISIS, GET ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IN THE BOOK & ON WEB SITE. We’ll use your donation to send 10 books to a prison, rehab center or community program that works with men looking for the tools to learn emotional maturity and a new way of being in the world. You can direct the books to a prison or program of your choice or select from our list. We’ll forward to you any mail we receive from the place we send your books. Your name will be added to the ARATAcode.com website to acknowledge your contribution and you’ll be listed in the book. 
Pledge $850 or more.

<li>I'm a former drama teacher of children aged 3-18. Throughout my teaching years, I have been inspired and in awe of children's imaginations. It is the hugely creative, optimistic, and open mind's of the youngest children I worked with that have inspired me to write stories for children aged 3-6years. These are the years where children share ideas and thoughts with no inhibitions and no limits. I want to encourage this means of free-thinking through my stories.</li>

I could never afford to self-publish on my own but I don't want my work to sit on a USB, unread and untouched by the very children that I have written it for. If every one of my friends gave me 50p, I would be well on my way to getting published. I'm openly asking for help because this is a project that I want to see through.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><strong>SALEM AVENUE</strong> is a collection of horror stories that examines the city as a source of horror, focusing on paranoia, isolation, and urban decay. They all exist in the same universe and are united by an alien threat from the other side of the stars.</p>
<p>My name is Joseph Theis and I am the author of <strong>SALEM AVENUE</strong>. I wrote this book through Georgetown University's Creator Institute, inspired by own experiences living in Washington, DC after witnessing the pain and suffering of the most vulnerable people living on the streets and in struggling neighborhoods. </p>
<p>I hope that, by reading this book, you will have a new understanding of the city not only as the center of  but also as a place where promises of progress fall through, where those who live above the skyline abandon those who live in their shadows. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601307223/krsx8au6owu7crjziw2n.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>SALEM AVENUE</strong> consists of four different stories:</p>
<p><strong>The Black Spot</strong> - A man living alone in the city contracts an infection from a mysterious spot of black mold growing in the corner of his apartment. His sense of paranoia grows as he isolates himself against the world.</p>
<p><strong>Salem Avenue</strong> - Elba Reed, a high school senior in the town of Hager's Fancy, discovers a terrible power hidden inside herself and shared by a dangerous cult living in the abandoned house on Salem Avenue. </p>
<p><strong>Necropolis</strong> - The city of Los Huesos plays host to an unforeseen outbreak as Michael Foster makes his way on foot from his job downtown back to his home in San Lorenzo.</p>
<p><strong>Forbidden Things</strong> - A government compliance officer uncovers more than routine nonconformity during a site visit to Talos Industries. Advances in biotech have relied on a mysterious black mold that threatens to overwhelm the facility and spread out into the world.</p>

<p>You will love this book if you are a fan of horror, or if you are interested in experiencing the city from an entirely new viewpoint! <strong>SALEM AVENUE</strong> speaks to those who live in the city, and those who do not, and enables everyone to examine the flaws in the leadership of urban communities that have failed their most vulnerable inhabitants. Ultimately, I hope that this book inspires reflection and meaningful dialogue about the abandonment of the homeless and the poor in urban centers. I look forward to engaging in these conversations with my readers, and I know that together we can work toward a more just society for all.</p>

We met through mutual friends in Melbourne over a decade ago and have been close ever since. Viva now lives in LA and is an actress, writer, and producer while Vicky has been working in publishing in London and Istanbul over the past five years. One day last year, Viva called Vicky with an idea: let's start a magazine that explores the many shades of the female experience and champions kick-ass female pioneers of our generation.  Before Viva could even finish, Vicky interrupted her: ""V! This has been my dream as well! Lets do it!!""</p><p><b>What is SheRa Mag?</b></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><i>SheRa Mag</i> is an online magazine for girls who think. We publish daily trending stories
in culture, fashion, film and TV, music, and world issues pertaining to women.
We also publish a themed issue every 2–3 months (past issues have included 'The Sex Issue' and 'The Dream
Issue'), which consists of around 13 feature articles, including a fashion
editorial. It is this component which sets <i>SheRa Mag </i>apart from most online
magazines, and our content from issues remains the highest viewed to date.</p><p><a href=""http://www.sheramag.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sheramag.com</a><br/></p><p><i>SheRa Mag</i> is also a proud and active member of the Its Time 2015 hosting committee – a US national summit designed to elevate female leadership around the world. #ItsTime2015</p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></b></p>

</span></p><p>As
we produce a free magazine, we need funding to keep producing relevant
editorial content. First and foremost, we want to pay our wonderful, hardworking writers. To this day, everyone, including 20 writers and other creatives (photographers, hair and makeup artists, graphic designers) have contributed for free. But to keep them working for us, we need to compensate them for their efforts.

<p></p></div>","Hi, we're Viva and Vicky, founders and editors of SheRa Mag. We met through mutual friends in Melbourne over a decade ago and have been close ever since. Viva now lives in LA and is an actress, writer, and producer while Vicky has been working in publishing in London and Istanbul over the past five years. One day last year, Viva called Vicky with an idea: let's start a magazine that explores the many shades of the female experience and champions kick-ass female pioneers of our generation.  Before Viva could even finish, Vicky interrupted her: ""V! This has been my dream as well! Lets do it!!""What is SheRa Mag?

SheRa Mag is an online magazine for girls who think. We publish daily trending stories
in culture, fashion, film and TV, music, and world issues pertaining to women.
We also publish a themed issue every 2–3 months (past issues have included 'The Sex Issue' and 'The Dream
Issue'), which consists of around 13 feature articles, including a fashion
editorial. It is this component which sets SheRa Mag apart from most online
magazines, and our content from issues remains the highest viewed to date.www.sheramag.comSheRa Mag is also a proud and active member of the Its Time 2015 hosting committee – a US national summit designed to elevate female leadership around the world. #ItsTime2015
Why is SheRa Mag raising money?
As
we produce a free magazine, we need funding to keep producing relevant
editorial content. First and foremost, we want to pay our wonderful, hardworking writers. To this day, everyone, including 20 writers and other creatives (photographers, hair and makeup artists, graphic designers) have contributed for free. But to keep them working for us, we need to compensate them for their efforts. Giving value to ideas, research, and writing is of upmost importance to us – particularly in an age when most online content is free to consume. (It's worth noting that while SheRa Mag angles itself towards women, our contributors consist of both men and women.) Secondly, to achieve our goal of widening the conversation on women’s issues, introducing readers to interesting women and generally empowering girls and women around the world, we need to set aside a budget to pursue and investigate stories. This includes attending relevant events and festivals, conducting face-to-face interviews, and shooting fashion editorials with women of all shapes and sizes and ethnicities.
We also need to
inject funding into our marketing campaign in order to reach our intended
target audience. As we endeavour to reach a truly global audience, to penetrate our target audience, and to get the very urgent message of gender equality out there, we need to conduct specific and sometimes radical campaigns – from producing controversial social media messages, to raising awareness in universities and other institutions, to launching multi-media campaigns for the web and TV, to running competitions. The goal is that through advertising and affiliate programmes, SheRa Mag generates enough income to pay its own way and keep the quality content flowin'. If we don't reach our entire goal, we will still divvy up the funds we raise, dedicating approximately 50% to marketing and 50% to editorial. What you'll get from us...We have a plethora of delicious perks, from spunky t-shirts and keyrings, to owning your very own copy of the SheRa Mag Year Book, to having a Skype convo or a lunch with us in person, to advertising your business on our website, to the chance of being a guest editor and helping us curate an issue.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The book chronicles the story of Latvians in Canada’s Manitoba province starting in 1895 and closing off just recently at the LV100 celebrations in Winnipeg. It is a story of Latvian pioneers who left their homeland looking for land that they could call their own. It is the story of those forced to flee Latvia after the failed 1905 Revolution when workers and farmers rose up against the Baltic barons and the Czarist Russian administration and had to flee for their lives. It is the story of post-World War II refugees who fled Soviet occupation and arrived as labourers in Manitoba to build a thriving Latvian community that survived until the early 21st century. </p>
<p>Even though the story is set in Manitoba, it could easily be the story in many Latvian communities across Canada and the USA. It is a timeless story of immigrants leaving their homeland in difficult circumstances, of building a life in a strange country, of longing for the home, friends and family left behind, about the inroads made by assimilation in later generations. A story as relevant today as it was 50 or a 100 years ago</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The book is in full colour with a hard-cover in landscape 8.5” x 11” format. It is approximately 280 pages with 50,000 words spanning over 120 years of history and richly illustrated with over 450 photographs. Most of the photographs have never been published before and the earliest photographs are rare finds from the attics, closets and family albums of the descendants of Latvian immigrants to Manitoba.</p>
<p>The book has been professionally edited and designed. It was reviewed by Professors Andrejs Plakans and Andris Straumanis and includes a testimonial from Professor Plakans.</p>

<p>This book is going to be about web development in Perl 6 using Bailador.</p>
<h3>A few words about myself</h3>I've been using Perl 5 since 1995 and teaching it since 2000. In addition to the basic <strong>Perl Programming</strong> course I have developed and taught several additional courses: an <strong>Advanced Perl programming</strong> course; a course called <strong>Test Automation Using Perl</strong>; and a course called <strong>Web Development Using Perl</strong>.<p>In addition, I have taught courses combining a Perl-based backend with frontend written in JavaScript, JQuery, and AngularJS.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years I have also extensively used <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Python Flask</a> for several web applications.</p>
<p>I run the <a href=""https://perlmaven.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perl Maven</a> website with 770 articles about Perl 5 that receive approximately 10,000 visits a day. I created the <a href=""http://perlweekly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perl Weekly newsletter</a> that has more than 6,000 subscribers. The <a href=""http://perl6maven.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perl 6 Maven</a> has more than 50 articles. The <a href=""https://code-maven.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Code Maven</a> site has more than 200 articles about languages that are not Perl. Other sites and projects are listed on my <a href=""https://szabgab.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">home page</a>.</p>
<p>Altogether I've written over 1,000 articles in the last couple of years. If you are interested in my writing style, head over to either of the Maven sites and check out your favorite subjects. Specifically you might want to take a look at the <a href=""http://perl6maven.com/bailador"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">articles about Bailador</a>.</p>
<p>The Perl 6 Maven site has been running on Bailador and Rakudo Perl 6 for several years now on a simplified blog engine. Its source code is available <a href=""https://github.com/szabgab/Perl6-Maven/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>I have been using Perl 6 on and off for several years now and a couple of years ago I also taught several courses of Perl 6. In Oslo, Lisbon, and Frankfurt.</p>
<h3>Perl 6 books</h3>
<p>... that will show you it is time for this book.</p>
<p>A handful of Perl 6 books have been published, and there are more in the works. There is a desire for Perl 6 books from both publishers and developers. Given the importance of web development, it’s time for a web development book for Perl 6.</p>Andrew Shitov published <a href=""https://deeptext.media/perl6-at-a-glance/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perl 6 at a Glance</a> and he is working on <a href=""https://deeptext.media/migrating-to-perl6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Migrating to Perl 6</a> now.<p>Laurent Rosenfeld with Allen B.

<p>Moritz Lenz is close to the finish line with <a href=""http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484228982"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perl 6 Fundamentals</a>.</p>
<p>brian d foy is working on the <a href=""https://www.learningperl6.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Learning Perl 6</a> book.</p>
<p>I think it is time to publish a book about Web development using Perl 6.</p>
<h3>Crowd-funding</h3>Writing well researched articles is not an easy task. Preparing teaching material is really difficult. Writing a book is the combination of the two.<p>In addition, for this book I'll have to develop several web applications. It needs a lot of time. Ther are also other expenses. Like the <a href=""http://bailador.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bailador.net</a> domain name, the design of a logo, the hosting of the web site together with the demo site. As the book will be self-published through  <a href=""https://leanpub.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LeanPub</a> all this expense falls on me.</p>
<p>I believe by the time I finish writing the book in December there will more than a 1,000 who will want to buy it, but having many supporters up front will encourage me much more.</p>
<p>Indiegogo, allows for partial funding of a project. That means any amount contributed will be used.  Basically you can think about it as <strong>buying the book at a discount</strong> and showing the other potential readers that there is interest.</p>
<p>The planned date for publishing the final version is December 2017.</p>
<h3>What happens if the crowdfunding goal is not reached?</h3>
<p>I definitely want to produce something that will be valuable to those who supported the book. So I'll write the book even if we don't reach the goal.</p>
<p>However, if you did not support support the book, you'll have to pay more for the book and you'll also miss out on the opportunity to show your support.</p> <h3>Planned Chapters</h3>
<p>The chapters are a work in process, and as with all works in progress, the details may evolve or change completely as I work on it. But the following gives my current plan. Moreover, you are more than welcome to suggest changes!</p>

<li>Blog engine</li>
<li>A job board</li>
<li>Real estate manager</li>
<li>Flight ticket vendor for low-cost flights</li>
<li>Banner ads rotator</li>
<li>Conference organizer</li>
</ul><h3> </h3><h3>The expected end results</h3><p>I am writing the book in LeanPub and you can access it <a href=""https://leanpub.com/bailador"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. The book will be available in electronic format (pdf, epub, and mobi). I have a plan to provide a printed version of the book, but I don't know yet how and thus I don't want to make promises.</p><h3>Prerequisites</h3><p>The book assumes some some programming background and some web development background, but it won't require a knowledge of Perl 6. It will introduce enough knowledge of Perl 6 to understand the code in the book.</p><p> </p><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is an outline of the book. Some of the planned features might not be implemented for Perl 6 yet. Features missing from Bailador probably won't be an issue as I have commit rights to the main repository of Bailador, but I am not a web-framework developer.<br/>Features outside of Bailador might not to be available yet.</p>
<p>With that said, the writing of the book and the sample applications will certainly impact the development of Bailador and the additional libraries needed to implement the applications and thus I am quite confident, this is doable</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>You can certainly help getting the word out and make some noise about this campaign.</li>
<li>You can ask your employer to chip in, or to invite me for a training session.</li>
<li>Twitter, Facebook, IRC channels, blog post, etc. Anything that might help reaching more people.</li>
<li>You can also contribute sample project ideas for consideration.</li>
</ul></div><h3>What others say</h3><p><i>""I think this is an excellent proposal.

The chapters are a work in process, and as with all works in progress, the details may evolve or change completely as I work on it. But the following gives my current plan. Moreover, you are more than welcome to suggest changes!
Hello WorldIn this chapter we set up the basic environment for developing our web application.

Install and set up Rakudo Perl 6
""Hello World"" on the command line
Install Bailador
""Hello World"" with Bailador
Testing the ""application"" so far
Adding to Git and GitHub
Setting up Continuous Integration using Travis-CI

DeploymentMost of the books will put the deployment to the end of the bookor skip it entirely. In today's world of Continuous Integrationand Continuous Deployment we need to make sure we can deployour application from the very beginning. Even if it is as simpleas our ""Hello World"" application. Then we need to keep deploying to ensurethe pipe never breaks.

 The expected end resultsI am writing the book in LeanPub and you can access it here. The book will be available in electronic format (pdf, epub, and mobi). I have a plan to provide a printed version of the book, but I don't know yet how and thus I don't want to make promises.PrerequisitesThe book assumes some some programming background and some web development background, but it won't require a knowledge of Perl 6. It will introduce enough knowledge of Perl 6 to understand the code in the book. 
Risks & Challenges
This is an outline of the book. Some of the planned features might not be implemented for Perl 6 yet. Features missing from Bailador probably won't be an issue as I have commit rights to the main repository of Bailador, but I am not a web-framework developer.Features outside of Bailador might not to be available yet.
With that said, the writing of the book and the sample applications will certainly impact the development of Bailador and the additional libraries needed to implement the applications and thus I am quite confident, this is doable
Other Ways You Can Help

You can certainly help getting the word out and make some noise about this campaign.
You can ask your employer to chip in, or to invite me for a training session.
Twitter, Facebook, IRC channels, blog post, etc. Anything that might help reaching more people.
You can also contribute sample project ideas for consideration.
What others say""I think this is an excellent proposal. Now that Perl 6 is officially released, more than anything else we need books that show potential users how convenient, practical, and real-world useful the language is. This book would meet those criteria admirably, and Gabor certainly has the understanding, the experience, and the writing skills to complete it successfully. Take my money, dammit! :-)""--  Damian Conway author of Perl Best Practices  ""With Gabor's many years of experience teaching and writing about Perl, I'm confident that he'll be able to deliver on this proposal and provides us with a Perl6 book that will be a helpful resource for many future Perl6 programmers.""-- Olaf Alders creator of MetaCPAN. ""I've been largely ignoring Perl 6 development since the projectstarted in 2000. I figured that I would have plenty of chance to catchup with it before clients started expecting me to know it. Theofficial release of Perl 6 eighteen months ago means that the time isnow right for me to start taking an interest. A lot of the code Iwrite drives web sites, so I want to get up to speed with webdevelopment in Perl 6 quickly. That's why I supported thiscrowdfunding campaign - I want to read this book and I think thatGabor is the right person to write it.""-- Dave Cross author of Data Munging with Perl. ""It's been apparent for a few years now that Perl 6 is the single greatest computer language everinvented, yet the world has not yet woken up to this. Gabor's persistent dedication to the Perlcommunity has been an example to all of us and his book will make an immense contribution towards getting Perl 6 the recognition it so richly deserves.""-- Peter Scott author of Perl Debugged, Perl Medic, and Human Cusp.",4.0,0,"3 Campaigns

My name is Shawn Bailey and I have the first 100 pages of my next novel written. I need your help to complete it.</p><p>I've been writing since I was in the fifth grade. I write short stories, poetry, articles for a local paper, novellas, and novels. A year or so ago, I decided to self publish my third book, a horror novella called <i>Sorry Charlie</i>, to see what the process was like. I had a very good digital artist do the cover and another friend helped me edit it. Then I messed with the formatting a little and put it on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and CreateSpace. Turns out it's not that impossible to self publish a book. I learned something new and proved to myself that I could do it. I'll be doing the same thing with my next book <i>The Village</i>.</p><p><i>The Village</i> is important to me because I can directly relate to the main character. She spent her youth in a small Danish village called the Meadows. The village is steeped in religion and arcane practices ( <i>I grew up in Anniston, AL. Egocentric center of the Southern Baptist Universe. Enough said.</i> ). As Celeste approaches adulthood she begins to question everything, and finally moves away from her home. With the blinds removed, her views of the world and God rapidly change. But a death brings her back to the village where both her old and new beliefs will be challenged.</p><p>If you have ever moved on from a stagnant environment of any kind, you will know the feeling you get when you start thinking about what it would be like to be trapped back in that environment. This novel is the expression of those uncomfortable feelings of doubt, loyalty, fear, and truth, all wrapped up in a setting where there is no escape. When your will is not your own.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What's Needed</h3><p>My day job is web development, and my contract ended in November. I'm currently working on getting another contract, but this is a horrible time of year to do so. What I really want to do is spend 10 hours a day finishing <i>The Village</i> and still be able to have a roof over my head. The only way I can do that is with your help. Otherwise, it's 8 hours a day job hunting and then once I'm signed on, it's usually balls to the wall with deadlines looming. There is no time for writing. I know, I know. All the magazines on writing would have you believe that there is <i>always </i>time for writing, but in truth, sometimes there just isn't. So where does your money go and what do you get besides making me very, very happy?</p><ul>

I'm tired of wasting my life away doing things that I can never master, because I don't love them they way I love writing. I do a good job, but I will never be a coding guru. But I can be the guy who writes that book that teachers force you to read in school. Helping me get this book out gives me a <b>chance </b>at changing my main source of income from programming to writing.

</p><p><i>Coast of Denmark 985 A.D.</i></p>
<p>Asger sipped his potato soup and smiled at Ebba.  The food was a warm blanket that Ebba wove for him each evening.  His fishing trips were shortened to only 3 hours of daylight.  But his last catch was a good one and they were eating three servings each, something reserved usually for a six or seven hour day of sun, when the plants began flourishing on their small hillside.  </p>
<p>The sweet smell of baked fish and fresh bread filled the small cottage.  They ate in comfortable silence, the only sound – the soft lapping of the sea, muffled by the dense night.  Asger tore off a chunk of bread and watched the hypnotic flames spend their ephemeral seconds whipping snake-like tongues at the open hearth.  Ebba sat back in her chair and held her belly, smiling.  She was satiated.  Asger reached a hand over and rubbed her swollen midsection.  It would be their first.</p>
<p>He then slid his hand down to the crease of her leg and smiled a mischievous smile.  She returned the smile.  Then the door exploded open, the small iron lock ripped from the shattered wood.</p>
<p>Asger jumped to his feet, trying to take in what was happening.  Ebba moved back as quickly as someone with child could, her every muscle tensing in fear.  Asger reached for the knife on the table as a large man, naked from the waist up, blasted by him and fell face first next to the wall to Asger’s left.  The room was not large and Asger was on the man before he could rise to his feet.  He grabbed the man’s throat with his massive hands and hauled him to the wall, pressing him against the timber and placing the knife at the man’s belly.  His head swirled quickly to take in Ebba’s position and then as far behind him as he could manage.  The door was empty, but he was expecting men to file through at any moment.  The sea people’s raids had slacked off in the past few seasons, but it was not unheard of on this side of the coast for small homes like his to be raided by starving seafarers to the north.</p>
<p>“Weapons woman!  Weapons!  The door!”</p>
<p>Ebba moved to her right and grabbed a sword in one hand and a large cleaver-like butcher knife with the other.  Asger knew she could fight if necessary, and would do so, to the death, to protect the child.  But he could see the terror in her eyes.  The stories they had heard of what happened to the women the sea people took.</p>
<p>Asger spun his instant aggression back around to the man.</p>
<p>“Who’s with you!  How many!”</p>
<p>But the man was not paying him attention.  He was focusing on the doorway and the one hinge that it now clung to, hanging slightly askew.  The man was pale-white and more frightened than Ebba.  </p>
<p>Asger looked down at the ice on the man’s beard and bare chest.  He looked like he had swam the sea, ice caked everywhere, the man shaking uncontrollably from the cold with his pale face holding his sunken and terror filled eyes.</p>
<p>“Answer!  Answer!  Now, or die!”</p>
<p>Asger did not recognize the man as being from his village.  He didn’t want to kill a man who was not going to harm him, but he didn’t have the luxury of trying to figure this out if more men were about to overtake them.  His fist tensed around the knife.</p>
<p>“Asger!”  Ebba yelled behind him.</p>
<p>He turned, expecting a fight.  Ebba had gone to try and close the door.  She stood with the door in one hand and the cleaver in the other.  The man started to whimper.</p>
<p>Standing outside the doorway was a small girl.  She was dressed in a small gown, dirty with mud.  Asger looked back at the man.  The man was crying.  Tears rolled down his face.  His body was limp with fear.  He was mumbling something to Asger that was not in his tongue.  Asger let the man’s throat slide from his grip, as he watched the door from the corner of his eye.  If the man moved toward him or Ebba, he would kill him immediately.  He glance fleetingly at her belly, a curve of life nestled underneath the cloth.</p>
<p>Ebba looked down at the girl.  Hair ragged.  Cuts on her face.  Mud caked everywhere.  </p>
<p>“Poor thing,”  Ebba said.  She put a hand out towards the girl, as if to assure the young one that she was alright now.</p>
<p>The man screamed and made for Ebba.  Asger’s hand came fast and solid.  The knife entered the man’s chest and the force behind the blow swept the man’s feet from under him.  There was a loud thud on the dirt floor.  Asger followed the man down with his arm, kneeling slightly and withdrawing his knife quickly and with as much force as he had used to place it.  The man gurgled on blood as Asger spun to face the door.</p>
<p>He glanced at Ebba, who had herself screamed when the man came for her.  She was silent now with her hand covering her mouth.  The little girl had not moved a muscle.</p>
<p>Asger’s senses were heightened, his adrenaline pumping.  He listened outside for footsteps.  Nothing.  He looked past the girl, out to the sea, and scanned for firelight on the water.  Nothing.  Once again, there was no sound save the lapping of the waves on the beach below.  </p>
<p>He looked at the girl.  Like the man, something was not right with her.  He knew that running around outside with no covering on a night like tonight would result in a quick death.  So where did these people come from?  He had been speaking another tongue.  </p>
<p>The girl was looking at the dying man.  A blank look.  No emotion.  And the man managed to slide his arm around and, spitting blood from the corner of his mouth, point to the girl.  But no, he wasn’t pointing to the girl.  To the bottom of the door.  The man’s eyes glazed over as death took him.</p>
<p>The firelight from the open hearth and the candles cast a dim light through the doorway.  Shadows danced around the girl as her gown moved slightly in the chilly sea breeze.  </p>
<p>Ebba moved away from the door.  She had been staring intently at the girl.  Now she motioned to the girl as she was backing away.  She was saying something.  Asger’s mind was still racing, assessing the threats that might still be lurking beyond the shadows in the doorway.  Where his supply of weapons were, where their food was, the sheep, and the boat, he couldn’t let them take the boat.  Ebba repeated herself louder when she saw Asger wasn’t hearing her.  Asger looked at her through his muddled thoughts.</p>
<p>“- not dirt.  It’s not dirt.”</p>
<p>Ebba continued backing away.  Asger studied the girl again from head to toe.  The first thing he noticed was the lack of expression.  Had the man done something to her?  Her eyes looked funny somehow.  Then her dirty gown.  Then her bare feet.  No one’s bare feet could last more than a rock’s throw out there, but here stood a girl with no cover on her feet.</p>
<p>As he stood there, it came to him.  He looked down at his knife, still dripping with the dead man’s blood.  He looked back at the girl.  </p>
<p>It’s not dirt.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t.  The firelight swept across her small frame and Asger could see that it was not mud she was caked in, but blood.  He instinctively moved back a step.  He could see now that her eyes were not just cloaked in shadow.  Shadow was their color.  The color of night.  A slight reflection in them, a circle of eclipsed moonlight around the outer edges.</p>
<p>“Hand me the spikes woman.”</p>
<p>Asger’s tone was even and calm.  He could hear Ebba shuffling through the chest behind him but he did not turn from the girl.  He understood what the man was trying to tell him now, but he didn’t have time for regret now.  The man was telling him not to let her in.  If only he could have understood the man.</p>
<p>“Here.  Here!” groaned Ebba, her tremulous voice behind him.</p>
<p>He reached his arm back and grabbed the spikes and hammer in his left hand.  Using his right foot, he slammed the heavy wooden door against the opening.  The girl still standing motionless in the snow.  It was crooked and didn’t fit perfectly, but that was fine.  He used his massive arms to slam the door back in place and then dropped his knife, working quickly, and hammered the spikes through the door and into the timber.  When he was finished, he got seven more spikes and hammered them in place. </p>
<p>Asger and Ebba stayed awake and kept the fire burning.  They listened in silence for sounds outside.  There were none.</p>
<p>Only the lapping of the waves on the rocks and sand.</p><div>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>Aalborg University in Copenhagen – Today</i></p>
<p>Celeste Balslev sat in her dormitory room, wrapped in a blanket and staring at lines of her medical textbook that were now merging in a fuzzy, unfocused mesh of e. e. Cummings and Greek.  She had read the same line four times and still had no idea what it was saying.  She had 40 or 50 pages to go before she could even begin to feel ready for the exam tomorrow, but at 2:30 in the morning she was exhausted.  One of her roommates, an exchange student named Sai Jien, had come in from partying thirty minutes ago and passed out sideways in her bed.  How she kept up her grades was a mystery to Celeste.  </p>
<p>She had been studying and sacrificing her social life for the past year, and had only one A to show for it.  The rest were B’s and one C.  The C she was proud of though, in Mendelson’s class people were just happy to pass.  She looked over at the clock one last time to make sure it was set, then pulled the covers over her and drifted quietly off to sleep.</p>
<p>Alarms were ringing.  </p>
<p>People screaming in the hallway.  </p>
<p>Panic.</p>
<p>Celeste threw off the covers and looked over at Sai, both of them wide-eyed and confused.  There was smoke in the room.  It was only a light mist, something you might open a kitchen window for if you had forgotten something in the oven.  But one thing was certain.  Something was on fire.  Sai hopped up and slipped on her shoes.</p>
<p>“Come on Cel’, move it!” she barked at her friend.</p>
<p>Celeste moved like a drunken sailor on the high seas, her legs still asleep and her mind exhausted from being jerked out of her dream state.  Sai grabbed her book bag and a trinket from her table and made for the door.  Swinging it open, Sai stood in the doorway yelling something at Celeste that she couldn’t follow.  She was grabbing her blanket, the one her mom had sewn for her as a child, and her pictures, and the computer had all her-</p>
<p>“Celeste!  Now!  I can see the fire!  Now, let’s go!” screamed Sai.</p>
<p>There was even more smoke in the hall.  She never realized until now how many things she had that she didn’t want to let go of.  </p>
<p>“I’m right behind you!  Go!” yelled Celeste.  Sai took one last look at her and bolted down the hallway.</p>
<p>The screams in the hallway became louder.  Footsteps down the hall.  People running.  Yelling outside, maybe from passersby or maybe from people already in safety’s arms, watching their belongings go up in flame.  How bad was the fire?  Celeste’s arms were full.  She ran for the door.</p>
<p>Then stopped.</p>
<p>She was only a couple of feet from the door.  She had no idea why she was stopping.  She simply was not moving forward.  She couldn’t.  </p>
<p>Celeste could hear the roaring of flames down the hall.  This wasn’t a small fire.  Something that could be put out with a couple of extinguishers.  This was an inferno.  She was on the third floor.  She had to move and move now.  She began to invoke all of her will power that she could muster.  Her left leg inched reluctantly forward a few inches.  Her body did not follow.  Her brow creased in concentration.  What was wrong with her?  This was ridiculous.</p>
<p>Move, Celeste!  Move your ass!</p>
<p>Now she was screaming at herself.  What was holding her back?  She had a thought.  She looked at her hands, full of things from home.  Things that she had taken with her.  Maybe that was holding her back.  All those years of tradition and beliefs.  All those antiquated practices.  All the lies.  She looked down at her things and then turned around and threw them to the floor.  A flood of guilt hotter than the fire washed over her.  She had thrown things away that were dear to her.  She had thrown away part of her life.  Part of her family, what of it she had left.  But she had to escape.  Had to get out of here.</p>
<p>She would find new things with a new life.  She would break free of the fear and faith and find a new life with some cute boy, if she could ever stop studying long enough to find one.</p>
<p>Celeste stepped forward, almost even with the doorjamb, and stopped again.  This time it was more forcible.  Like a giant, invisible hand had grabbed her by the chest and held her in place.  Her blood ran cold and her thoughts scattered.  Her heart felt constricted.  The blood in her veins, an ice cold syrup, clogging everything up and freezing her into an immobile, concrete statue.</p>
<p>From the corner of her eye, she could see the flames making their way down the hall to her left.  Only four rooms down, the center of the hallway looked like the middle of a campfire.  Still, Celeste could not move.  She looked down and recoiled in horror.</p>
<p>At the threshold of the door, where there should have been a piece of aluminum or brass, was a line of dirt and dead grass.  A line she knew well.  A line she and the other kids used to dance across all during the year, all except for three days.  During those three days, no one passed the line.  No one.</p>
<p>And what time of the year was it after all?  Wasn’t it about that time?  Of course it was.  She knew it was.  Like other people who grew up in the village, she didn’t need a calendar or watch to tell her when it was time.  She could feel it in her bones.  Now the flames were only two rooms down.  She felt a coldness on her wrist.  Looking down, she saw a large chain hanging from a shackle attached to her arm.  She followed it across the room and saw the familiar piece of over-sized, spiked iron driven into the tiles of the dorm room like they were sand.</p>
<p>“No!” Celeste screamed.</p>
<p>One door away now.  The flames were relentless, indifferent.  She was sweating profusely and tried to use the sweat to slide her wrist through the shackle.  It was too tight.  There was no way out.  Then something made the hair on the back of her neck stand up.  She could feel it’s presence in the room, somewhere behind her.  Something whose gravity of simply existing in proximity to Celeste threatened to shut down all of her faculties and drag her in to its abyss.  She couldn’t budge.  Could not move a muscle, not even her eyes.   </p>
<p>The searing heat from the fire was now directly in front of her.  Engulfing the doorway as it would soon engulf her.  Then a voice behind her.  The vibrations from its words moving through every cell in her body with a malicious and mocking virility.  Its tone so deep that it shifted the fire in front of her as it passed her by.</p>
<p>“I AAAAAMMMM WAAAIII – TIIINNGGG FOOOR YOOOOUUU.”</p>
<p>Tears streamed down Celeste’s face.  They sizzled on the way down from the heat.  She could not move.  Only burn. </p>
<p>The pain was intense.  Overwhelming.  It was too much to bear.  Her only consolation was that she would surely pass out in a few seconds and it would be over.  But as her hair caught fire, she realized that the thing behind her was not going to let her die right away.  It was going to keep her alive and watch her burn to a crisp.  Perhaps it would never let her die.  Perhaps it would let her live forever.  Roasting in the fire like a pig for all eternity.  </p>
<p>And as if to echo her thoughts, the voice reverberated again, filling the room, the building, filling the whole of the universe.</p>
<p>“WEEE HAAAVVVVEE EEEETEEEERNNNIIITYYYYYY.”</p>
<p>The flames licked her unmoving eyes, searing the moist cornea and melting it onto the pupil.  She was blind.  Celeste could not even move to scream, the pain unbearable.  She could feel the front part of her T-Shirt explode in flames.  The voice rose in deep undulations behind her.  A guttural chasm of laughter.  How could there ever be so much pain in one body, in one soul.  </p>
<p>It was only then that Celeste thought of God.  </p>
<p>She awoke screaming.  </p>
<p>Sai had her by the arm with a look of concern on her face.  </p>
<p>“I’m right here.  I’m right here, Cel’,” she was chanting reassuringly.</p>
<p>Celeste was drenched in sweat.  It took her a moment to come around, to scan the dorm room and make sure that the thing was not there, that the building was not on fire.</p>
<p>“My God, girl.  That was the worst one yet.”</p>
<p>Celeste said, “Sorry Sai.”  She wiped the sweat from her brow with the pillow case.  “I’m, uh… I’m okay.  You can go back to sleep.  Sorry.”</p>
<p>“You’re fine?  Look, I don’t want to be pushy, but you really need to see someone about these.  They’re a little more frequent . . . you know?”</p>
<p>Celeste knew she was right.  Once a month was bearable.  Twice a week was too much.  After this week of tests were over, she would head to a doctor or shrink.  Maybe she would talk with professor Haslund.  She had heard talk that he had done some research in sleep studies during his grad years an eon ago.  </p>
<p>“Thanks, Sai.  Sorry again.”</p>
<p>Sai looked at her clock.  “Well, test’s at 8:00.  It’s only three hours away.  Why don’t we head down and get a coffee.  Sprint the last mile.  Whaddya say?”</p>
<p>Sai was right.  There was no use in trying to go to sleep again, not that she could if she wanted to.  And if she did, it would just be harder to wake up in two hours.</p>
<p>They got ready and headed down to the café.</p>
<p>A few more tests.  </p>
<p>A few more years.  </p>
<p>And she would be out for good.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>                                                             ~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Celeste felt a slight elevation after taking the test.  Sure, with no sleep she would crash early tonight, but for now she was certain of a B, or at the least, a high C.  That was passing.  Before her schooling was over, she couldn’t imagine a cell in the human body that she would not be able to resolutely define in both form and function.  A little confidence was slowly seeping back into her life.</p>
<p>She passed Sai on the way to the room and asked her how she did.</p>
<p>“Piece of cake, sister-girl.  You?”</p>
<p>“The same,” Celeste lied.</p>
<p>As Sai turned to head to her last test, she spun back around and hollered at the retreating Celeste.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah.  Your Uncle is waiting for you in the room.”</p>
<p>Sai continued walking, but Celeste stopped in her tracks.  </p>
<p>She did not have an Uncle. </p>
<p> Her mind went straight to the Elders.  To the debriefing.  Then to the Travelers.  She began walking and turning things over in her head.  Why would they have sent someone out to contact her?  She wasn’t a rebel.  A free thinker, yes.  But she wasn’t one of the ones that were stirring the pot.  She kept to herself here.  Went about her business with her head down and was only a couple of years away from true freedom.  Financial independence.  Maybe the stories you heard as a child were true.  Maybe they never really let you leave.  Maybe they show up in your dorm room and smother you with a pillow.</p>
<p>Ridiculous.  People were everywhere.  And here she was again, letting that silly fear creep into her gullible spine again.  It was entrenched.  Little soldiers of dogma, bore down tight in the trenches of her doubts and revelations.  A constant pressure point, applied from afar by a history of conditioning from the time she could crawl.  Nature and nurture.  Maybe everywhere else the environment was only fifty percent, but in Herlige Eng Af Håb it was more like ninety nine percent.  Let the brainwashing begin.</p>
<p>As she walked slower and with anticipation back to the room, she remembered the first time someone had asked her where she was from.  She had answered quiet truthfully – The Glorious Meadow of Hope.  There was a blank stare and an unsure smile.  And that was the end of that conversation before it ever began.  She learned to tell people she was from a farm.  Simple enough.  It seemed to paint the same benign stereotype in everyone’s head.  And that was fine.  The more history she learned, the more she studied other cultures and countries, the more she realized that it sounded strangely like some North Korean propaganda.  Come relax in our glorious meadows of hope and shining heaven.</p>
<p>She pushed the door open, trying to seem unabashed by the intrusion, as if she was perhaps accustomed to strange men showing up unannounced in her room.  The man was standing by the window to the courtyard –</p>
<p>- <i>Right where the thing would have been standing in my dream</i> –</p>
<p>- and turned slowly and calmly around when she entered.  He had a kind, but haggard face, like a monk who had worked in the fields all his life.  A light silver beard, trimmed short and blue eyes like the sea.  She knew he was from the village immediately.  The man smiled a wan smile.  </p>
<p>She had decided before entering the room that she would inject a forceful silence upon whoever it was and force them to speak first.</p>
<p>“Hi,” she said.</p>
<p>The man looked stunned for a split second and then recovered immediately.</p>
<p>“Hi, Celeste.” </p>
<p>He walked a little closer.  They stood three feet apart and stared at each other for a moment in silence.</p>
<p>Celeste said, “Did I do something?”  </p>
<p>The man looked slightly incredulous and then saw her confusion.</p>
<p>“Oh, no child.  Forgive me… forgive me.”  He carried such a strange, offsetting disposition.  She had yet to form a first impression.  “My name is Paul.  I come from the Meadow.”</p>
<p>“I got that.”</p>
<p>She followed with a smile when it came out a little harsher than she had anticipated.  He smiled back.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.  I um… I am very sorry to come to you this morning.  I was informed you were finished with your tests?”</p>
<p>This Traveler was sorry.  About what?  Her mind went straight to her mother.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?  Yes.  I’m done,” Celeste offered, shaking her head and shaking away this man’s stupid questions about her test.  “What is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s Elsa.”  Celeste could feel her stomach clench.  “I’m very sorry.  She passed last night.  It was a stroke.  It was very quick.”</p>
<p>Celeste caught herself shaking.  Remembering the last time she had called her mother.  Almost a week ago.  A week.  How could she wait a week to call her mother?  She suddenly had an intense dislike for this man in her dorm room.  This smiling little man who was telling her that her mom was . . . dead.  Gone forever.  Good morning.  How’d you do on your tests?  Your mother’s gone forever.</p>
<p>Celeste sat down on the bed and felt helpless teardrops stream down her face.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry, child.  So very sorry.  She was a wonderful woman.”</p>
<p>Emotions welled up in Celeste that she had never felt, deep seismic forces that she was finding hard to control.  This wasn’t fair.  This was . . . this was . . . she didn’t have the words to even describe how horrible this was.  Her confusion and fear and despair all pushed forward, a tidal wave of anxiety with no outlet.  She began sobbing like a child.</p>
<p>“How do you know?""  Again, even in her misery, it was too harsh.  She followed with a less severe, “How did you know her?”</p>
<p>The man looked like he was searching for the right words in a dense forest of awkward phrases and canned clichés.  He had no answer.  And how could he, she thought.  She had never seen this man before in her life.  He didn’t know her mother.  He didn’t know anything.  He was a messenger from a place she was trying to escape.  Somewhere her mother never would, not now.  Not that she had wanted to.</p>
<p>“I need to be alone,” Celeste blurted.  “Please.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.  Forgive me.  I’ll wait outside. “</p>
<p>The man made his way to the door before turning around –</p>
<p>- right in the spot where she was burning alive the night before –</p>
<p>- and added, “I’ve booked us a flight for this evening.  The funeral’s early tomorrow.”</p>
<p>He closed the door.  Celeste wanted to scream.  Couldn’t bring herself to.  Her mom was gone.  She was going to be buried tomorrow and no one had asked her a damn thing.  A flight reservation and the funeral time made without her consent.  In a world that she was imposing her will upon not thirty minutes ago, she now felt the world pushing back, imposing its will on her.  A rug had just been jerked from under her feet.  She fell sideways on the bed and soaked the pillow with sadness.</p>
<p>She stayed on the bed for thirty minutes, then began to slowly gather her things.  In the dream the night before, she had no time to waste grabbing pieces of nostalgia, and had even cast them aside in order to save herself.  Now she had all the time in the world.  She gathered the blanket close to her chest and inhaled deeply.  It was useless.  It had been through a hundred washings in the past five years.  It didn’t smell like anything but detergent and sweat.  She added some tears to the soft quilt.</p>
<p>She took her time packing, almost hoping that when she opened the door the man would be gone.  It was just some cruel prank.  Some Alzheimer’s patient wondered off and mistook her for someone’s daughter.  But when she opened the door, she found the man, Paul he had said, standing just down the hall.  He made a move to grab her suitcase but Celeste kept walking.</p>
<p>“I’ve got it,” she said curtly, and kept walking without knowing her destination.</p>
<p>The man put his arm down and followed.</p>
<p>There was no conversation in the car.</p>
<p>When they reached the airport, it was only noon.  They had four hours to kill.</p>
<p>“Are you hungry?” Paul asked.</p>
<p>She was not.</p>
<p>They watched people hurry along.  Some people smiling and happy.  Maybe they were headed on a vacation.  Celeste began to weep silently, her head turned so as not to attract attention.</p>
<p>“We need to push the funeral back a day.  I’m sure there are some things you haven’t taken care of.”</p>
<p>Paul hesitated.  He looked helpless for a moment.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, child.  The . . . the festival starts tomorrow night.”</p>
<p>Celeste shook her head in silence.  Her mother’s funeral was moved up to accommodate the festival.  If this would have happened six or seven years ago, she wouldn’t have thought twice about such a thing.  But she was out of the box now.  Now it was a slap in the face to Celeste.</p>
<p>And to my mother, Celeste thought.</p>

</div><p></p></div>","The Village Fundraising CampaignHi, everybody. My name is Shawn Bailey and I have the first 100 pages of my next novel written. I need your help to complete it.I've been writing since I was in the fifth grade. I write short stories, poetry, articles for a local paper, novellas, and novels. A year or so ago, I decided to self publish my third book, a horror novella called Sorry Charlie, to see what the process was like. I had a very good digital artist do the cover and another friend helped me edit it. Then I messed with the formatting a little and put it on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and CreateSpace. Turns out it's not that impossible to self publish a book. I learned something new and proved to myself that I could do it. I'll be doing the same thing with my next book The Village.The Village is important to me because I can directly relate to the main character. She spent her youth in a small Danish village called the Meadows. The village is steeped in religion and arcane practices ( I grew up in Anniston, AL. Egocentric center of the Southern Baptist Universe. Enough said. ). As Celeste approaches adulthood she begins to question everything, and finally moves away from her home. With the blinds removed, her views of the world and God rapidly change. But a death brings her back to the village where both her old and new beliefs will be challenged.If you have ever moved on from a stagnant environment of any kind, you will know the feeling you get when you start thinking about what it would be like to be trapped back in that environment. This novel is the expression of those uncomfortable feelings of doubt, loyalty, fear, and truth, all wrapped up in a setting where there is no escape. When your will is not your own.What's NeededMy day job is web development, and my contract ended in November. I'm currently working on getting another contract, but this is a horrible time of year to do so. What I really want to do is spend 10 hours a day finishing The Village and still be able to have a roof over my head. The only way I can do that is with your help. Otherwise, it's 8 hours a day job hunting and then once I'm signed on, it's usually balls to the wall with deadlines looming. There is no time for writing. I know, I know. All the magazines on writing would have you believe that there is always time for writing, but in truth, sometimes there just isn't. So where does your money go and what do you get besides making me very, very happy?
Gets the book a basic edit and review.
Keeps a roof over my family's head for now. Until February, at least.
Stretch Goal - $2,900Allows for preliminary cover design and artwork.How This Changes My LifeI don't want to do anything but write. I'm tired of wasting my life away doing things that I can never master, because I don't love them they way I love writing. I do a good job, but I will never be a coding guru. But I can be the guy who writes that book that teachers force you to read in school. Helping me get this book out gives me a chance at changing my main source of income from programming to writing. I will be extremely happy to take that initial cut in income, as long as my family and I can survive.I've already published one book, so I know how to do it again.

Intro
Coast of Denmark 985 A.D.
Asger sipped his potato soup and smiled at Ebba.  The food was a warm blanket that Ebba wove for him each evening.  His fishing trips were shortened to only 3 hours of daylight.  But his last catch was a good one and they were eating three servings each, something reserved usually for a six or seven hour day of sun, when the plants began flourishing on their small hillside.  
The sweet smell of baked fish and fresh bread filled the small cottage.  They ate in comfortable silence, the only sound – the soft lapping of the sea, muffled by the dense night.  Asger tore off a chunk of bread and watched the hypnotic flames spend their ephemeral seconds whipping snake-like tongues at the open hearth.  Ebba sat back in her chair and held her belly, smiling.  She was satiated.  Asger reached a hand over and rubbed her swollen midsection.  It would be their first.
He then slid his hand down to the crease of her leg and smiled a mischievous smile.  She returned the smile.  Then the door exploded open, the small iron lock ripped from the shattered wood.
Asger jumped to his feet, trying to take in what was happening.  Ebba moved back as quickly as someone with child could, her every muscle tensing in fear.  Asger reached for the knife on the table as a large man, naked from the waist up, blasted by him and fell face first next to the wall to Asger’s left.  The room was not large and Asger was on the man before he could rise to his feet.  He grabbed the man’s throat with his massive hands and hauled him to the wall, pressing him against the timber and placing the knife at the man’s belly.  His head swirled quickly to take in Ebba’s position and then as far behind him as he could manage.  The door was empty, but he was expecting men to file through at any moment.  The sea people’s raids had slacked off in the past few seasons, but it was not unheard of on this side of the coast for small homes like his to be raided by starving seafarers to the north.
“Weapons woman!  Weapons!  The door!”
Ebba moved to her right and grabbed a sword in one hand and a large cleaver-like butcher knife with the other.  Asger knew she could fight if necessary, and would do so, to the death, to protect the child.  But he could see the terror in her eyes.  The stories they had heard of what happened to the women the sea people took.
Asger spun his instant aggression back around to the man.
“Who’s with you!  How many!”
But the man was not paying him attention.  He was focusing on the doorway and the one hinge that it now clung to, hanging slightly askew.  The man was pale-white and more frightened than Ebba.  
Asger looked down at the ice on the man’s beard and bare chest.  He looked like he had swam the sea, ice caked everywhere, the man shaking uncontrollably from the cold with his pale face holding his sunken and terror filled eyes.
“Answer!  Answer!  Now, or die!”
Asger did not recognize the man as being from his village.  He didn’t want to kill a man who was not going to harm him, but he didn’t have the luxury of trying to figure this out if more men were about to overtake them.  His fist tensed around the knife.
“Asger!”  Ebba yelled behind him.
He turned, expecting a fight.  Ebba had gone to try and close the door.  She stood with the door in one hand and the cleaver in the other.  The man started to whimper.
Standing outside the doorway was a small girl.  She was dressed in a small gown, dirty with mud.  Asger looked back at the man.  The man was crying.  Tears rolled down his face.  His body was limp with fear.  He was mumbling something to Asger that was not in his tongue.  Asger let the man’s throat slide from his grip, as he watched the door from the corner of his eye.  If the man moved toward him or Ebba, he would kill him immediately.  He glance fleetingly at her belly, a curve of life nestled underneath the cloth.
Ebba looked down at the girl.  Hair ragged.  Cuts on her face.  Mud caked everywhere.  
“Poor thing,”  Ebba said.  She put a hand out towards the girl, as if to assure the young one that she was alright now.
The man screamed and made for Ebba.  Asger’s hand came fast and solid.  The knife entered the man’s chest and the force behind the blow swept the man’s feet from under him.  There was a loud thud on the dirt floor.  Asger followed the man down with his arm, kneeling slightly and withdrawing his knife quickly and with as much force as he had used to place it.  The man gurgled on blood as Asger spun to face the door.
He glanced at Ebba, who had herself screamed when the man came for her.  She was silent now with her hand covering her mouth.  The little girl had not moved a muscle.
Asger’s senses were heightened, his adrenaline pumping.  He listened outside for footsteps.  Nothing.  He looked past the girl, out to the sea, and scanned for firelight on the water.  Nothing.  Once again, there was no sound save the lapping of the waves on the beach below.  
He looked at the girl.  Like the man, something was not right with her.  He knew that running around outside with no covering on a night like tonight would result in a quick death.  So where did these people come from?  He had been speaking another tongue.  
The girl was looking at the dying man.  A blank look.  No emotion.  And the man managed to slide his arm around and, spitting blood from the corner of his mouth, point to the girl.  But no, he wasn’t pointing to the girl.  To the bottom of the door.  The man’s eyes glazed over as death took him.
The firelight from the open hearth and the candles cast a dim light through the doorway.  Shadows danced around the girl as her gown moved slightly in the chilly sea breeze.  
Ebba moved away from the door.  She had been staring intently at the girl.  Now she motioned to the girl as she was backing away.  She was saying something.  Asger’s mind was still racing, assessing the threats that might still be lurking beyond the shadows in the doorway.  Where his supply of weapons were, where their food was, the sheep, and the boat, he couldn’t let them take the boat.  Ebba repeated herself louder when she saw Asger wasn’t hearing her.  Asger looked at her through his muddled thoughts.
“- not dirt.  It’s not dirt.”
Ebba continued backing away.  Asger studied the girl again from head to toe.  The first thing he noticed was the lack of expression.  Had the man done something to her?  Her eyes looked funny somehow.  Then her dirty gown.  Then her bare feet.  No one’s bare feet could last more than a rock’s throw out there, but here stood a girl with no cover on her feet.
As he stood there, it came to him.  He looked down at his knife, still dripping with the dead man’s blood.  He looked back at the girl.  
It’s not dirt.
And it wasn’t.  The firelight swept across her small frame and Asger could see that it was not mud she was caked in, but blood.  He instinctively moved back a step.  He could see now that her eyes were not just cloaked in shadow.  Shadow was their color.  The color of night.  A slight reflection in them, a circle of eclipsed moonlight around the outer edges.
“Hand me the spikes woman.”
Asger’s tone was even and calm.  He could hear Ebba shuffling through the chest behind him but he did not turn from the girl.  He understood what the man was trying to tell him now, but he didn’t have time for regret now.  The man was telling him not to let her in.  If only he could have understood the man.
“Here.  Here!” groaned Ebba, her tremulous voice behind him.
He reached his arm back and grabbed the spikes and hammer in his left hand.  Using his right foot, he slammed the heavy wooden door against the opening.  The girl still standing motionless in the snow.  It was crooked and didn’t fit perfectly, but that was fine.  He used his massive arms to slam the door back in place and then dropped his knife, working quickly, and hammered the spikes through the door and into the timber.  When he was finished, he got seven more spikes and hammered them in place. 
Asger and Ebba stayed awake and kept the fire burning.  They listened in silence for sounds outside.  There were none.
Only the lapping of the waves on the rocks and sand.

Chapter 1

Aalborg University in Copenhagen – Today
Celeste Balslev sat in her dormitory room, wrapped in a blanket and staring at lines of her medical textbook that were now merging in a fuzzy, unfocused mesh of e. e. Cummings and Greek.  She had read the same line four times and still had no idea what it was saying.  She had 40 or 50 pages to go before she could even begin to feel ready for the exam tomorrow, but at 2:30 in the morning she was exhausted.  One of her roommates, an exchange student named Sai Jien, had come in from partying thirty minutes ago and passed out sideways in her bed.  How she kept up her grades was a mystery to Celeste.  
She had been studying and sacrificing her social life for the past year, and had only one A to show for it.  The rest were B’s and one C.  The C she was proud of though, in Mendelson’s class people were just happy to pass.  She looked over at the clock one last time to make sure it was set, then pulled the covers over her and drifted quietly off to sleep.
Alarms were ringing.  
People screaming in the hallway.  
Panic.
Celeste threw off the covers and looked over at Sai, both of them wide-eyed and confused.  There was smoke in the room.  It was only a light mist, something you might open a kitchen window for if you had forgotten something in the oven.  But one thing was certain.  Something was on fire.  Sai hopped up and slipped on her shoes.
“Come on Cel’, move it!” she barked at her friend.
Celeste moved like a drunken sailor on the high seas, her legs still asleep and her mind exhausted from being jerked out of her dream state.  Sai grabbed her book bag and a trinket from her table and made for the door.  Swinging it open, Sai stood in the doorway yelling something at Celeste that she couldn’t follow.  She was grabbing her blanket, the one her mom had sewn for her as a child, and her pictures, and the computer had all her-
“Celeste!  Now!  I can see the fire!  Now, let’s go!” screamed Sai.
There was even more smoke in the hall.  She never realized until now how many things she had that she didn’t want to let go of.  
“I’m right behind you!  Go!” yelled Celeste.  Sai took one last look at her and bolted down the hallway.
The screams in the hallway became louder.  Footsteps down the hall.  People running.  Yelling outside, maybe from passersby or maybe from people already in safety’s arms, watching their belongings go up in flame.  How bad was the fire?  Celeste’s arms were full.  She ran for the door.
Then stopped.
She was only a couple of feet from the door.  She had no idea why she was stopping.  She simply was not moving forward.  She couldn’t.  
Celeste could hear the roaring of flames down the hall.  This wasn’t a small fire.  Something that could be put out with a couple of extinguishers.  This was an inferno.  She was on the third floor.  She had to move and move now.  She began to invoke all of her will power that she could muster.  Her left leg inched reluctantly forward a few inches.  Her body did not follow.  Her brow creased in concentration.  What was wrong with her?  This was ridiculous.
Move, Celeste!  Move your ass!
Now she was screaming at herself.  What was holding her back?  She had a thought.  She looked at her hands, full of things from home.  Things that she had taken with her.  Maybe that was holding her back.  All those years of tradition and beliefs.  All those antiquated practices.  All the lies.  She looked down at her things and then turned around and threw them to the floor.  A flood of guilt hotter than the fire washed over her.  She had thrown things away that were dear to her.  She had thrown away part of her life.  Part of her family, what of it she had left.  But she had to escape.  Had to get out of here.
She would find new things with a new life.  She would break free of the fear and faith and find a new life with some cute boy, if she could ever stop studying long enough to find one.
Celeste stepped forward, almost even with the doorjamb, and stopped again.  This time it was more forcible.  Like a giant, invisible hand had grabbed her by the chest and held her in place.  Her blood ran cold and her thoughts scattered.  Her heart felt constricted.  The blood in her veins, an ice cold syrup, clogging everything up and freezing her into an immobile, concrete statue.
From the corner of her eye, she could see the flames making their way down the hall to her left.  Only four rooms down, the center of the hallway looked like the middle of a campfire.  Still, Celeste could not move.  She looked down and recoiled in horror.
At the threshold of the door, where there should have been a piece of aluminum or brass, was a line of dirt and dead grass.  A line she knew well.  A line she and the other kids used to dance across all during the year, all except for three days.  During those three days, no one passed the line.  No one.
And what time of the year was it after all?  Wasn’t it about that time?  Of course it was.  She knew it was.  Like other people who grew up in the village, she didn’t need a calendar or watch to tell her when it was time.  She could feel it in her bones.  Now the flames were only two rooms down.  She felt a coldness on her wrist.  Looking down, she saw a large chain hanging from a shackle attached to her arm.  She followed it across the room and saw the familiar piece of over-sized, spiked iron driven into the tiles of the dorm room like they were sand.
“No!” Celeste screamed.
One door away now.  The flames were relentless, indifferent.  She was sweating profusely and tried to use the sweat to slide her wrist through the shackle.  It was too tight.  There was no way out.  Then something made the hair on the back of her neck stand up.  She could feel it’s presence in the room, somewhere behind her.  Something whose gravity of simply existing in proximity to Celeste threatened to shut down all of her faculties and drag her in to its abyss.  She couldn’t budge.  Could not move a muscle, not even her eyes.   
The searing heat from the fire was now directly in front of her.  Engulfing the doorway as it would soon engulf her.  Then a voice behind her.  The vibrations from its words moving through every cell in her body with a malicious and mocking virility.  Its tone so deep that it shifted the fire in front of her as it passed her by.
“I AAAAAMMMM WAAAIII – TIIINNGGG FOOOR YOOOOUUU.”
Tears streamed down Celeste’s face.  They sizzled on the way down from the heat.  She could not move.  Only burn. 
The pain was intense.  Overwhelming.  It was too much to bear.  Her only consolation was that she would surely pass out in a few seconds and it would be over.  But as her hair caught fire, she realized that the thing behind her was not going to let her die right away.  It was going to keep her alive and watch her burn to a crisp.  Perhaps it would never let her die.  Perhaps it would let her live forever.  Roasting in the fire like a pig for all eternity.  
And as if to echo her thoughts, the voice reverberated again, filling the room, the building, filling the whole of the universe.
“WEEE HAAAVVVVEE EEEETEEEERNNNIIITYYYYYY.”
The flames licked her unmoving eyes, searing the moist cornea and melting it onto the pupil.  She was blind.  Celeste could not even move to scream, the pain unbearable.  She could feel the front part of her T-Shirt explode in flames.  The voice rose in deep undulations behind her.  A guttural chasm of laughter.  How could there ever be so much pain in one body, in one soul.  
It was only then that Celeste thought of God.  
She awoke screaming.  
Sai had her by the arm with a look of concern on her face.  
“I’m right here.  I’m right here, Cel’,” she was chanting reassuringly.
Celeste was drenched in sweat.  It took her a moment to come around, to scan the dorm room and make sure that the thing was not there, that the building was not on fire.
“My God, girl.  That was the worst one yet.”
Celeste said, “Sorry Sai.”  She wiped the sweat from her brow with the pillow case.  “I’m, uh… I’m okay.  You can go back to sleep.  Sorry.”
“You’re fine?  Look, I don’t want to be pushy, but you really need to see someone about these.  They’re a little more frequent . . . you know?”
Celeste knew she was right.  Once a month was bearable.  Twice a week was too much.  After this week of tests were over, she would head to a doctor or shrink.  Maybe she would talk with professor Haslund.  She had heard talk that he had done some research in sleep studies during his grad years an eon ago.  
“Thanks, Sai.  Sorry again.”
Sai looked at her clock.  “Well, test’s at 8:00.  It’s only three hours away.  Why don’t we head down and get a coffee.  Sprint the last mile.  Whaddya say?”
Sai was right.  There was no use in trying to go to sleep again, not that she could if she wanted to.  And if she did, it would just be harder to wake up in two hours.
They got ready and headed down to the café.
A few more tests.  
A few more years.  
And she would be out for good.

                                                             ~~~~~~~~~~

Celeste felt a slight elevation after taking the test.  Sure, with no sleep she would crash early tonight, but for now she was certain of a B, or at the least, a high C.  That was passing.  Before her schooling was over, she couldn’t imagine a cell in the human body that she would not be able to resolutely define in both form and function.  A little confidence was slowly seeping back into her life.
She passed Sai on the way to the room and asked her how she did.
“Piece of cake, sister-girl.  You?”
“The same,” Celeste lied.
As Sai turned to head to her last test, she spun back around and hollered at the retreating Celeste.
“Oh, yeah.  Your Uncle is waiting for you in the room.”
Sai continued walking, but Celeste stopped in her tracks.  
She did not have an Uncle. 
 Her mind went straight to the Elders.  To the debriefing.  Then to the Travelers.  She began walking and turning things over in her head.  Why would they have sent someone out to contact her?  She wasn’t a rebel.  A free thinker, yes.  But she wasn’t one of the ones that were stirring the pot.  She kept to herself here.  Went about her business with her head down and was only a couple of years away from true freedom.  Financial independence.  Maybe the stories you heard as a child were true.  Maybe they never really let you leave.  Maybe they show up in your dorm room and smother you with a pillow.
Ridiculous.  People were everywhere.  And here she was again, letting that silly fear creep into her gullible spine again.  It was entrenched.  Little soldiers of dogma, bore down tight in the trenches of her doubts and revelations.  A constant pressure point, applied from afar by a history of conditioning from the time she could crawl.  Nature and nurture.  Maybe everywhere else the environment was only fifty percent, but in Herlige Eng Af Håb it was more like ninety nine percent.  Let the brainwashing begin.
As she walked slower and with anticipation back to the room, she remembered the first time someone had asked her where she was from.  She had answered quiet truthfully – The Glorious Meadow of Hope.  There was a blank stare and an unsure smile.  And that was the end of that conversation before it ever began.  She learned to tell people she was from a farm.  Simple enough.  It seemed to paint the same benign stereotype in everyone’s head.  And that was fine.  The more history she learned, the more she studied other cultures and countries, the more she realized that it sounded strangely like some North Korean propaganda.  Come relax in our glorious meadows of hope and shining heaven.
She pushed the door open, trying to seem unabashed by the intrusion, as if she was perhaps accustomed to strange men showing up unannounced in her room.  The man was standing by the window to the courtyard –
- Right where the thing would have been standing in my dream –
- and turned slowly and calmly around when she entered.  He had a kind, but haggard face, like a monk who had worked in the fields all his life.  A light silver beard, trimmed short and blue eyes like the sea.  She knew he was from the village immediately.  The man smiled a wan smile.  
She had decided before entering the room that she would inject a forceful silence upon whoever it was and force them to speak first.
“Hi,” she said.
The man looked stunned for a split second and then recovered immediately.
“Hi, Celeste.” 
He walked a little closer.  They stood three feet apart and stared at each other for a moment in silence.
Celeste said, “Did I do something?”  
The man looked slightly incredulous and then saw her confusion.
“Oh, no child.  Forgive me… forgive me.”  He carried such a strange, offsetting disposition.  She had yet to form a first impression.  “My name is Paul.  I come from the Meadow.”
“I got that.”
She followed with a smile when it came out a little harsher than she had anticipated.  He smiled back.
“Yes, of course.  I um… I am very sorry to come to you this morning.  I was informed you were finished with your tests?”
This Traveler was sorry.  About what?  Her mind went straight to her mother.
“What’s wrong?  Yes.  I’m done,” Celeste offered, shaking her head and shaking away this man’s stupid questions about her test.  “What is it?”
“It’s Elsa.”  Celeste could feel her stomach clench.  “I’m very sorry.  She passed last night.  It was a stroke.  It was very quick.”
Celeste caught herself shaking.  Remembering the last time she had called her mother.  Almost a week ago.  A week.  How could she wait a week to call her mother?  She suddenly had an intense dislike for this man in her dorm room.  This smiling little man who was telling her that her mom was . . . dead.  Gone forever.  Good morning.  How’d you do on your tests?  Your mother’s gone forever.
Celeste sat down on the bed and felt helpless teardrops stream down her face.
“I’m so sorry, child.  So very sorry.  She was a wonderful woman.”
Emotions welled up in Celeste that she had never felt, deep seismic forces that she was finding hard to control.  This wasn’t fair.  This was . . . this was . . . she didn’t have the words to even describe how horrible this was.  Her confusion and fear and despair all pushed forward, a tidal wave of anxiety with no outlet.  She began sobbing like a child.
“How do you know?""  Again, even in her misery, it was too harsh.  She followed with a less severe, “How did you know her?”
The man looked like he was searching for the right words in a dense forest of awkward phrases and canned clichés.  He had no answer.  And how could he, she thought.  She had never seen this man before in her life.  He didn’t know her mother.  He didn’t know anything.  He was a messenger from a place she was trying to escape.  Somewhere her mother never would, not now.  Not that she had wanted to.
“I need to be alone,” Celeste blurted.  “Please.”
“Yes, of course.  Forgive me.  I’ll wait outside. “
The man made his way to the door before turning around –
- right in the spot where she was burning alive the night before –
- and added, “I’ve booked us a flight for this evening.  The funeral’s early tomorrow.”
He closed the door.  Celeste wanted to scream.  Couldn’t bring herself to.  Her mom was gone.  She was going to be buried tomorrow and no one had asked her a damn thing.  A flight reservation and the funeral time made without her consent.  In a world that she was imposing her will upon not thirty minutes ago, she now felt the world pushing back, imposing its will on her.  A rug had just been jerked from under her feet.  She fell sideways on the bed and soaked the pillow with sadness.
She stayed on the bed for thirty minutes, then began to slowly gather her things.  In the dream the night before, she had no time to waste grabbing pieces of nostalgia, and had even cast them aside in order to save herself.  Now she had all the time in the world.  She gathered the blanket close to her chest and inhaled deeply.  It was useless.  It had been through a hundred washings in the past five years.  It didn’t smell like anything but detergent and sweat.  She added some tears to the soft quilt.
She took her time packing, almost hoping that when she opened the door the man would be gone.  It was just some cruel prank.  Some Alzheimer’s patient wondered off and mistook her for someone’s daughter.  But when she opened the door, she found the man, Paul he had said, standing just down the hall.  He made a move to grab her suitcase but Celeste kept walking.
“I’ve got it,” she said curtly, and kept walking without knowing her destination.
The man put his arm down and followed.
There was no conversation in the car.
When they reached the airport, it was only noon.  They had four hours to kill.
“Are you hungry?” Paul asked.
She was not.
They watched people hurry along.  Some people smiling and happy.  Maybe they were headed on a vacation.  Celeste began to weep silently, her head turned so as not to attract attention.
“We need to push the funeral back a day.  I’m sure there are some things you haven’t taken care of.”
Paul hesitated.  He looked helpless for a moment.
“I’m sorry, child.  The . . . the festival starts tomorrow night.”
Celeste shook her head in silence.  Her mother’s funeral was moved up to accommodate the festival.  If this would have happened six or seven years ago, she wouldn’t have thought twice about such a thing.  But she was out of the box now.  Now it was a slap in the face to Celeste.
And to my mother, Celeste thought.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><em><strong>Wit and Humor Magazine</strong></em> is an iTunes Newsstand digital magazine which is optimized for viewing on the iPad. The magazine will be published once a month beginning in November 2012.</p>
<h1>What is <em>Wit and Humor Magazine</em> about?</h1>
<p>The new and upcoming <em><strong>Wit &amp; Humor Magazine</strong></em> shines a humorous spotlight on human behavior. By combining wit, humor, science, a few factoids, some absurdity, along with your funny bone, we will explore the various antics humans get themselves into and have a good laugh about it.</p>
<p>In the magazine, not only will we explore the science behind why people do the things they do, there will be plenty of funny examples of them doing it.</p>
<p>The magazine will contain articles written by known as well as up-and-coming humorists; comic strips and illustrations; as well as audio and video skits.</p>

<p>As such, we will keep the humor mostly clean and positive, and certainly free of harsh expletives. The types of humor included in the magazine will probably include the following: dry, witty, silly, esoteric, parody, and British-style; along with a touch of sarcasm.</p>
<p>We have plenty of published and unpublished comedians and humorists just waiting to entertain you through the Wit and Humor Magazine.</p>

<h1>Who Will Be Some of the Characters in the Magazine?</h1>
<p>Along with the various articles contributed by comedians and humorists, the magazine will feature what we call the <strong>Inner Illumination Team</strong>. This team has been created by Addison C. Arthur and is a team of characters depicting various countries and belief systems from around the world.</p>
<p>The idea behind the team is to provide the magazine's listeners and viewers some interesting and often humorous perspectives on human behavior.</p>

<p>Of course there is nothing like playing the Inner Illumination Team off of the local yokels and some ""not-so-benevolent"" characters that Addison is cooking up for you. All-in-all, we have some interesting articles and skits in mind for your entertainment.</p>
<h1>Expert Opinions</h1>
<p>Along with amusing viewpoints from contributing artists, we will have interesting articles from human behavior and humor experts such as Dr. Kathy Hahner and Addison C. Arthur.</p>

<h1>Why is the Magazine Made for the iPad?</h1>
<p>Forrester Research now predicts that 82 million Americans - or more than one-third of U.S. adults - will own a tablet computer by 2015.</p>
<p>""Of those sales, the lion's share will be iPads, and despite many would-be competitors that will be released, we see Apple commanding the vast majority of the tablet market through 2012,"" a Forrester analyst said.</p>
<p>It is estimated that there will be 1 in 4 (53 million) American iPad users by the end of 2012. This number does not include the number of non-Americans around the world using the iPad.</p>
<p>With most of the iPad users having an appreciation for humor, we thought it would be a great idea to optimize the magazine for them. Initially, the magazine will be available for download through the iTunes Newsstand. Eventually, we will see about getting the magazine published for the Kindle and Android platforms as well.</p>
<p>The digital format of the magazine allows us to do many cool things such as adding audio and video within it.</p>

<h2>THE PITCH (long version) </h2>
<p>2002 was not a happy time for me; at least, not initially. I was in a position where my wife laid off, I was laid off, I had a little one to take care of and bills that would not stop coming in. So, being the responsible man of the house I go into job search mode.</p>
<p>This was my checklist:</p>
<p>[X] Post my resume on Monster<br/>[X] Search every (insert expletive of your choice) online job board I could find<br/>[X] Newspaper Want-ads<br/>[X] Email Recruiters and Contacts for leads<br/>[X] Go to Networking Events <br/>[X] Go to Job Fairs<br/>[X] Department of Labor Office<br/>[X] Contact Temp Employment Agencies<br/>[X] Walk into companies and fill out applications</p>
<p>And the more I did these things, the more frustrated I became because I was not getting the results I needed. I blamed the economy, I blamed others for not recognizing my skills, I shifted the blame to there being too much competition in the workplace and eventually I began to doubt myself. I also tried to laugh at the situation as I considered the irony at the time, me, a recruiter, looking for work.</p>
<p>The turning point for me came about 2 weeks into my job search. Sure, not a long time by other measures, but the uncertainty and feeling of desperation was real nonetheless. I was at the kitchen table with a stack of bills on one side of me and a pile of printed off job descriptions on the other when I said  (in jest mind you), “God,something has got to happen and quick.”</p>
<p>And then, a light illuminated my face and angels began to sing and my next job appeared before my eyes. Hah! Not really, not even half of that, but dramatic nonetheless. It occurred to me that I was doing the same thing, in the same way as everyone else and getting the same results – no job.</p>
<p>“Do something different,” I said out loud, and from that moment on, I did.</p>
<p>It was not uncommon in 2002, to be unemployed for several months before landing a position. Once I changed my job search strategy, I was working in two months. It was a simple thing, really. I took my knowledge of how recruiters act, think and search for talent and reversed engineered the process to my advantage. Not only that, I was determined to not be in that situation again. So, what did I do? Once I found work, I did not stop looking and in a very real way, I positioned myself to perpetually refuse job offers. In this way, I have a type of insurance should the specter of layoffs ever darken my door again. Did it work? Or rather, has it worked since the recession of 2002? Yes.</p>
<p>Although I was laid off (again) in 2008, the season of another recession, I was able to secure a new corporate gig in four months time. (Although, I did service several clients on a contract basis via my own business in between corporate opportunities.) If that does not sound remarkable to you, then you have been fortunate enough not to have to look for work when the jobless rate was greater than the great depression.</p>
<p>But I digress, my intention is not to brag on my success, but to help you with yours. Why? Simply put, I have not forgotten what it felt like to be without a job and no prospects and I don't wish that on anyone.</p>

THE PITCH (short version) 
I am writing a book on job / career hunting called ""How To Find a Job Now (and never have to look for a job again)."" I have already produced several videos on job hunting strategies, spoken at career ministries and job seeker events, written articles on how to find hidden jobs, contributed to a few books, participated in podcasts and achieved some notoriety in the recruiting world but, I do not have a book of my own. It has been suggested to me on several occasions that I should do so and I feel that now is the right time.
 

I was quoted in: Globe and Mail, US News and World Report, Wall Street Journal and The Atlanta Journal and Constitution.  Monster.com, Entrepreneur Magazine, Black Enterprise and The HR Examiner have all cited my contribution to job seekers.

 
I have been involved in the recruiting industry for over a decade and have worked for such companies as Google, Microsoft, Siemens, MCI and a host of startup companies. I have produced award winning blogs, been featured in several leading publications and have been cited several times for my digital influence.

<div>Action/Thriller series following a family torn apart by war and espionage in the Alaska wild.
Books, Audiobooks, and Documentary Film.<br/><br/>I am an Alaskan and an indie writer with a passion for getting the 
details right about the land I love. Survival in desperate situations is
 always difficult, but in an Arctic environment there are factors that 
take that difficulty closer to impossible. People have lived in Alaska 
for thousands of years before modern technology, so it is obviously 
possible.<br/><br/>So much of what people know about Alaska comes from 
Hollywood which usually gets it very wrong, wrong to the point that if 
someone followed the advice even of some of the ""reality shows"" they 
could end up dead very fast. While my books are fiction, I strive to 
show my home state as it really is in all its harsh beautiful reality, 
and to provide real tools that a reader could employ if they found 
themselves in the unthinkable situation of trying to survive in an 
extreme climate. And that's where ICE HAMMER comes in.<br/><b><br/>The Story: </b><ul><li><div>
<p>Ice Hammer is a three book fiction series seen through the eyes of a 
family ripped apart by invasion and the ensuing war that consumes the 
North American continent, including their home state of Alaska. It is 
not about the bigger political game that stands behind all war, but it 
is about the lives, the loves and the bitter struggles of those trying 
to survive to see another day<b>. </b></p>
<p></p>
</div></li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Set Up</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p></p>
<p><b>2013</b>: NSA spy scandal lost the US many of its friends. </p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
<p><b>
2016: </b>The US government defaults on its debts. With the collapse of 
the American Empire the few remaining US allies turn their backs as 
well. </p>
<p><b>2017</b>: Massive drought and crop failures spread across Eurasia threatening both China and the former Soviet states with starvation. 
</p>
<p><b>2018</b>: The decision is made. America will pay its debts. </p>
<p>
In a sweeping measure to collect what they are owed, guarantee ample 
food supplies and take fertile land for their own people, China and the 
newly re-Sovietized Russia combine forces and invade North America. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As limited nuclear strikes devastate major cities and 
population centers Chi-Sov forces rush to take and hold tactically 
significant segments of the continent paving the way for the transfer of
 their own populations for re-settlement and conquest.</p>
<p>Just as it 
was for settlers in the early days of the American continent it is a 
bold new world for Chinese and Russian adventurers. In the face of 
methodical brutality at the hands of the conquerors, the locals don’t 
intend to give up the land without a fight. </p>
<p>Brad Stone, IT chief 
for the VA Hospital in Anchorage Alaska, has dropped his teen sons off 
at Boy Scout Summer Camp and is heading home for a planned romantic week
 with his beautiful Korean born wife Youngmi when death rains down from 
the sky. Rockets and troops cut off the highway forcing Brad to escape 
into the mountains on foot. He must choose whether to save his sons at 
scout camp, or find Youngmi first. As the war rages around them Brad, 
Youngmi and their teen boys, end up in separate but equally deadly 
situations. Unsure of whether any of the other family members are alive,
 each of them must survive and bring the fight to the invader. See the 
partial cast of characters below.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p></p>
<h1><b>Status of the series:</b></h1>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The entire three book series has been outlined and the first draft of
 book one is complete. Drafts of the next books are under way, and the 
first book is starting its initial follow-up rewrite, adding the flesh, 
muscle and sinew to the skeleton until it comes fully alive.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Barring major craziness like hurricanes in my bathroom, massive 
snow-storms in the kitchen, or alternate/parallel dimensions opening up 
in my recording booth and turning it into a portal for an alien species 
to leap through a time warp and attempt to conquer the earth, ICE HAMMER
 Book One should be ready for submission by late 2014. With the help of 
pledges at the Executive level, this could potentially go even faster.</p>

<h1><b>Why the Funding Request?</b></h1>
<p>In writing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=basil+sands+ebook&amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Abasil+sands+ebook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my books</a>
 I try to make them as realistic and life-like as 
possible by way of hands on research. I am an avid outdoors-man who has 
lived the majority of my life in Alaska. Ranging from Fairbanks to 
Salcha, Palmer to Anchorage I've experienced temperatures as extreme as 
+110F and -80F <i>(not in the same day thank God)</i>, enjoyed an hours 
long roller-coaster on a boat in an ocean storm, stood sentry duty in 
sideways rain and slipped into an ice cave beneath a glacier that made 
superman's  HQ look positively drab. I've watch my wife's amazing tulip 
collection bloom all in one day as a technicolor reward for her 
gardening diligence only to witness a thousand pound momma moose eat the
 flowers off every last one of them as a mid-morning snack. I've hung 
tight with the twenty four hour summer sun and watched the Aurora 
Borealis fill the dark winter sky from horizon to horizon with swirling 
colors that danced like a supernatural ballet   While I've been around a
 lot, in such a big place there 
are innumerable places, objects and experiences I've not seen or done. 
As a self-published writer 
there are no royalty advances or support networks to offset costs of 
researching and producing the work.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Monies raised in this project will pay for that hands on research 
including sub-arctic mountain and wilderness survival training (<a href=""http://alaska-evasion-fieldcraft-survival.webs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">like this guy)</a>, indigenous skills such as hide preparation and food gathering, <a href=""http://www.alaskatactical.com/training.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tactical firearms classes by these guys</a>, historical and linguistics research at the <a href=""http://www.uaa.alaska.edu/native/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">University of Alaska Native Studies Dept</a> and the <a href=""http://www.alaskanative.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alaska Native Heritage Center</a>, and gear testing of modern equipment. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Part of the funds will be used to purchase up to date video and audio
 recording equipment for the purpose of creating a documentary titled 
""The Making of Ice Hammer"" that will chronicle the research and 
experiences I gain in preparing and writing this series of novels, 
information I expect to be very helpful to writers, new and experienced 
alike, especially if they attempt to tackle the subject of Alaska.</p>
<h1><b>Leaping into the mainstream publishing arena challenge</b></h1>
<div>
<p>If ICE HAMMER <b><i>is not</i></b> picked up by a major publisher it will be <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=basil+sands+ebook&amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Abasil+sands+ebook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">self-published as my previous titles have been</a>. Pledged funds will be spent on professional editing, book formatting and professional cover art. </p>

<p>Being an experienced indie writer with several self-published 
novels already out there I know some of the pitfalls that may lay ahead 
for this project. And as the techs and administrators of the Obamacare 
website became painfully aware of when HealthCare.gov floundered 
painfully to life a few weeks ago, I also know that there are trips and 
traps I cannot imagine lurking in the shadows waiting to ambush me. Time
 management, unexpected illness, day job emergencies, technical issues. 
Any of the above can toss a pebble into the works. How to overcome them?
 Persevere! The series is already outlined, the first book already 
drafted and the rest ready to be fleshed out. I made sure to have that 
much ready before putting the project into the public eye to ensure that
 ground work was already laid out and full tilt construction of the 
series could start from the word 'Go'!</p>

Books, Audiobooks, and Documentary Film.I am an Alaskan and an indie writer with a passion for getting the 
details right about the land I love. Survival in desperate situations is
 always difficult, but in an Arctic environment there are factors that 
take that difficulty closer to impossible. People have lived in Alaska 
for thousands of years before modern technology, so it is obviously 
possible.So much of what people know about Alaska comes from 
Hollywood which usually gets it very wrong, wrong to the point that if 
someone followed the advice even of some of the ""reality shows"" they 
could end up dead very fast. While my books are fiction, I strive to 
show my home state as it really is in all its harsh beautiful reality, 
and to provide real tools that a reader could employ if they found 
themselves in the unthinkable situation of trying to survive in an 
extreme climate. And that's where ICE HAMMER comes in.The Story: 
Ice Hammer is a three book fiction series seen through the eyes of a 
family ripped apart by invasion and the ensuing war that consumes the 
North American continent, including their home state of Alaska. It is 
not about the bigger political game that stands behind all war, but it 
is about the lives, the loves and the bitter struggles of those trying 
to survive to see another day. 



The Set Up




2013: NSA spy scandal lost the US many of its friends. 





2016: The US government defaults on its debts. With the collapse of 
the American Empire the few remaining US allies turn their backs as 
well. 
2017: Massive drought and crop failures spread across Eurasia threatening both China and the former Soviet states with starvation. 

2018: The decision is made. America will pay its debts. 

In a sweeping measure to collect what they are owed, guarantee ample 
food supplies and take fertile land for their own people, China and the 
newly re-Sovietized Russia combine forces and invade North America. 


As limited nuclear strikes devastate major cities and 
population centers Chi-Sov forces rush to take and hold tactically 
significant segments of the continent paving the way for the transfer of
 their own populations for re-settlement and conquest.
Just as it 
was for settlers in the early days of the American continent it is a 
bold new world for Chinese and Russian adventurers. In the face of 
methodical brutality at the hands of the conquerors, the locals don’t 
intend to give up the land without a fight. 
Brad Stone, IT chief 
for the VA Hospital in Anchorage Alaska, has dropped his teen sons off 
at Boy Scout Summer Camp and is heading home for a planned romantic week
 with his beautiful Korean born wife Youngmi when death rains down from 
the sky. Rockets and troops cut off the highway forcing Brad to escape 
into the mountains on foot. He must choose whether to save his sons at 
scout camp, or find Youngmi first. As the war rages around them Brad, 
Youngmi and their teen boys, end up in separate but equally deadly 
situations. Unsure of whether any of the other family members are alive,
 each of them must survive and bring the fight to the invader. See the 
partial cast of characters below.



Status of the series:



The entire three book series has been outlined and the first draft of
 book one is complete. Drafts of the next books are under way, and the 
first book is starting its initial follow-up rewrite, adding the flesh, 
muscle and sinew to the skeleton until it comes fully alive.


Barring major craziness like hurricanes in my bathroom, massive 
snow-storms in the kitchen, or alternate/parallel dimensions opening up 
in my recording booth and turning it into a portal for an alien species 
to leap through a time warp and attempt to conquer the earth, ICE HAMMER
 Book One should be ready for submission by late 2014. With the help of 
pledges at the Executive level, this could potentially go even faster.

Why the Funding Request?
In writing my books
 I try to make them as realistic and life-like as 
possible by way of hands on research. I am an avid outdoors-man who has 
lived the majority of my life in Alaska. Ranging from Fairbanks to 
Salcha, Palmer to Anchorage I've experienced temperatures as extreme as 
+110F and -80F (not in the same day thank God), enjoyed an hours 
long roller-coaster on a boat in an ocean storm, stood sentry duty in 
sideways rain and slipped into an ice cave beneath a glacier that made 
superman's  HQ look positively drab. I've watch my wife's amazing tulip 
collection bloom all in one day as a technicolor reward for her 
gardening diligence only to witness a thousand pound momma moose eat the
 flowers off every last one of them as a mid-morning snack. I've hung 
tight with the twenty four hour summer sun and watched the Aurora 
Borealis fill the dark winter sky from horizon to horizon with swirling 
colors that danced like a supernatural ballet   While I've been around a
 lot, in such a big place there 
are innumerable places, objects and experiences I've not seen or done. 
As a self-published writer 
there are no royalty advances or support networks to offset costs of 
researching and producing the work.



Monies raised in this project will pay for that hands on research 
including sub-arctic mountain and wilderness survival training (like this guy), indigenous skills such as hide preparation and food gathering, tactical firearms classes by these guys, historical and linguistics research at the University of Alaska Native Studies Dept and the Alaska Native Heritage Center, and gear testing of modern equipment. 


Part of the funds will be used to purchase up to date video and audio
 recording equipment for the purpose of creating a documentary titled 
""The Making of Ice Hammer"" that will chronicle the research and 
experiences I gain in preparing and writing this series of novels, 
information I expect to be very helpful to writers, new and experienced 
alike, especially if they attempt to tackle the subject of Alaska.
Leaping into the mainstream publishing arena challenge

If ICE HAMMER is not picked up by a major publisher it will be self-published as my previous titles have been. Pledged funds will be spent on professional editing, book formatting and professional cover art. 
If the series is picked up by a major publisher those 
funds will be spent on marketing and promotion (which the big pubs don’t
 do much of anymore) by getting out to as many book fairs, conferences 
and similar events as I can, and hopefully getting to meet some of you 
who have donated.

Being an experienced indie writer with several self-published 
novels already out there I know some of the pitfalls that may lay ahead 
for this project. And as the techs and administrators of the Obamacare

In my own experience, it’s never been as cut and dry as the romances that exist portray and I hope this book serves as a look into the real-life complexities of relationships. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the nuanced and raw chaos underneath the surface of relationships and romance. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to wonder and explore what being with someone means, begin to understand what identity and the constant pursuit of who we are really is, and ask questions about what we believe love is, what we’re taught it should be, and what we really truly want it to be beyond that.<br/><br/>The book follows an Indian-American girl, Kash, throughout her teenage years into her early twenties, and navigates the unknowns of falling in love and attraction through her eyes. It’s not easy, and it’s wrought with teenage wanting, attraction, and the visceral confusion of not knowing who she is or what she wants. The story is punctuated by moments where Kash shares a bed with certain people in her life and how sharing such a vulnerable space with someone changes her relationship with them.<br/><br/>If you enjoy exploring the more metaphysical, philosophical side of love and intimacy and unconventional romance as well as the relatable inner chaos of growing up (with copious amounts of angst), then I think you'll enjoy this book.<br/><br/><i>bedfellows</i> speaks to new adult and coming-of-age readers who want to grapple with both the complexities of growing up and defining ourselves to others, and intimacy—what it means to be with someone and the different ways we fall in love—in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that bedfellowsinspires you to think, challenge, and engage with questions like:</p><p>How do we (and do we ever) ‘grow up’ as individuals? </p><p>How do we know what we want? And how do our wants and desires define us?</p><p>Can romance and/or attraction be more than just platonic or physical?</p><p>What are the different ways we express love, in all its forms?</p><p>How does the intimacy and vulnerability of sharing a personal space (i.e. a bed or bedroom, a car, a childhood escape, etc.) affect the way we connect with others?</p><p> </p><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with you! I believe discussing, and realizing how different our answers are to these questions, will change us all for the better. </p><p> </p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p> </p><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>

In my own experience, it’s never been as cut and dry as the romances that exist portray and I hope this book serves as a look into the real-life complexities of relationships. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the nuanced and raw chaos underneath the surface of relationships and romance. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to wonder and explore what being with someone means, begin to understand what identity and the constant pursuit of who we are really is, and ask questions about what we believe love is, what we’re taught it should be, and what we really truly want it to be beyond that.The book follows an Indian-American girl, Kash, throughout her teenage years into her early twenties, and navigates the unknowns of falling in love and attraction through her eyes. It’s not easy, and it’s wrought with teenage wanting, attraction, and the visceral confusion of not knowing who she is or what she wants. The story is punctuated by moments where Kash shares a bed with certain people in her life and how sharing such a vulnerable space with someone changes her relationship with them.If you enjoy exploring the more metaphysical, philosophical side of love and intimacy and unconventional romance as well as the relatable inner chaos of growing up (with copious amounts of angst), then I think you'll enjoy this book.bedfellows speaks to new adult and coming-of-age readers who want to grapple with both the complexities of growing up and defining ourselves to others, and intimacy—what it means to be with someone and the different ways we fall in love—in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that bedfellowsinspires you to think, challenge, and engage with questions like:How do we (and do we ever) ‘grow up’ as individuals? How do we know what we want? And how do our wants and desires define us?Can romance and/or attraction be more than just platonic or physical?What are the different ways we express love, in all its forms?How does the intimacy and vulnerability of sharing a personal space (i.e. a bed or bedroom, a car, a childhood escape, etc.) affect the way we connect with others? I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with you! I believe discussing, and realizing how different our answers are to these questions, will change us all for the better.  What I Need & What You'll Get This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:
The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in Winter 2020 through Spring 2021.

The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this late Spring 2021
 When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook.When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition.When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

God has given me many blessings but Johnny is the greatest one of all! I only have my income to support the two of us. We struggle to make ends meet.

     fines de lucro para gestar alianzas positivas de transformación,
     solidaridad y paz. Entre las alianzas en las que formamos parte están
     GRUCORPO, que es un grupo de trabajo de varias organizaciones para

Solidaridad
con la Tacita de Café
Este año, en nuestra campaña Da Una Mano
por la Paz, contamos con la solidaridad de un grupo de ceramistas, que nos han
donado unas tazas, que utilizaremos como regalitos de agradecimiento en ciertas
categorías de donaciones. Las tazas fueron hechas a mano y en el torno
alfarero, usando porcelana y quemadas a alta temperatura. Participaron las
ceramistas Beatriz Fernández, Eduardo Tapia, Sandra Guillermety, Nora Álvarez y
Aileen Castañeda - presidenta de Casa Candina (http://www.casacandina.org/es/).
Contamos además con la colaboración del ceramista estadounidense Dan Zulawski (http://www.danzulawski.smugmug.com/),
quien nos donó el set de tres piezas. Con estas piezas, el grupo de ceramistas
se conecta con el sentido de comunidad de ALAPÁS y su proyecto Tacita de Café.
Nosotros tenemos el compromiso y la
voluntad de seguir trabajando. Tú también puedes ser parte de este proyecto de
transformación del dolor en solidaridad y paz aportando a esta campaña. Te
invitamos a Dar una mano por la PAZ, con la cantidad que puedas. Cada centavo
cuenta. ¡Contamos contigo!",0.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<h4>Important Update: I am floored by all your support! It took me half the time I thought it would to reach my goal, and I've already received double the traffic I expected. Though I have reached $5,000, I feel obliged to keep this momentum going, if only to continue getting the word out about the writers and publishers I'm so proud to call part of my community. A stretch goal of $6,200 would make it easier for me to afford both residencies and continue spreading the word about books, publishers and authors I know you'll love (and remember, anything that doesn't go to residency expenses goes to the Alzheimer's Association). Let's keep it up! <br/>

<p>A few months ago, I finished a rough draft of my novel. This opportunity—or these opportunities—will allow me to get my draft into workable shape. And right now, for so many reasons I'll discuss below, I'm going all in. Getting my book into workable shape means everything to me. <br/></p>

I love for a living. I get to edit books, I get to teach some of the most

<p>But all isn't gravy. Real talk: I’m
stuck. I’m treading water. I'm a gerbil on a wheel, a cat with its head stuck in a vase. I'm Winnie the Pooh high on honey, my butt stuck in Rabbit's front door. I'm Andre the Giant trying to squeeze out the window of a submarine. </p>

there's nothing to do but laugh at.  On top of all this, I've had some really difficult news in my family in the last few months. <br/></p>
<p>All that work and pressure makes it <i>really</i> hard to finish a
book, especially a book that’s any good. I got into this because I wanted to write books, but now here I am, without the time or energy to do so. And at the same time, I'm told that one of the only ways out—or at the very least a bare minimum to start clawing my way
out—is to finish that book. </p>
<p>And this is why I'm coming to you. In 2015, I will bring a working version of this book to life, or I will die trying. Not because I have to, mind you, or because I think it will magically solve all my life problems (trust me, I know it won't), but because it has been trying to come out for a long, long time.

Eisenhower, Omar Bradley, and Bernard Montgomery used to plan D-Day. Soon you can. We are bringing to life the original Neptune Monograph, a top-secret intelligence report from World War 2 that only exists in a few copies today. It has never been published and almost disappeared from history after the war, but we are now restoring the pages of one of the most important documents of WW2. After a very successful Kickstarter-campaign, we have decided to give new backers the opportunity to secure their copy of the Monograph here on IndieGoGo.The original 112 pages contained thorough information about everything from tidal forces to typical battle tactics and had the absolute highest security stamp during WW2: Top Secret Bigot - above Top Secret.It described the German defenses and typical strongpoints, the risk of chemical attacks and was so thorough it even had an analysis of the soil type on Utah and Omaha Beach. The book will contain a one-to-one copy of the original Monograph, new historical context and rare photos to explore. in total app 250 pages in hardcover including the original Monograph, added historical context and rare photos. We will restore every single page from 1944 to its original look as it was presented in the Neptune Monograph.   The original Monograph will run on the right page throughout the book. Here you get a rare insight into the depth of the incredible intelligence work and literally cast your eyes on the same pages, that the allied command got in their hand for the first time six weeks before D-Day.  Originally some of the left pages were blank. Here commanders could add their notes and latest updates. We have decided to use this space to give a deeper understanding of the Monograph and add historical context and rare photos on the left pages of the book to explore and get the full picture of how the information was collected. The Neptune Monograph was split into nine sections giving a deep and rare insight into the situation in Normandy six weeks before D-Day. All nine chapters will be in the book. The Monograph has more than 14 pages of charts, maps, and graphics showing predicted German troop movements, tidal charts, and graphics of the layout of typical German strongpoints in Normandy as well as charts of the naval threat from warships and mines. The maps, charts, and folios will be restored and printed in the book in full color.Henrik Elling has worked for more than 15 years teaching history and as an Editor in Chief at Scandinavia's best selling history- and science magazines.

<h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3>
<p><i>Betrayal - The Ethel Rosenberg Story</i> is a fictionalized account of the only woman executed by the U.S. government on charges related to espionage in more than 150 years.<br/><br/>My name is Alisa Parenti, and I wrote this book because in all that’s been written about the case, Ethel is portrayed either as completely innocent of conspiracy to commit espionage or as a spymaster working directly for the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>In reading <i>Betrayal</i>, you will discover that Ethel Rosenberg did not get a fair trial. As Ethel was  accused of betraying her country, she suffered betrayals of her own --  by her family, by the government and by society at large. This book provides an opportunity to engage with themes of hope and betrayal, and learn alongside Mary Wurth, a fictional reporter who tells Ethel’s story about staying true to one’s beliefs, and about the very high price people sometimes pay to do so. </p>
<p>My hope is that lovers of historical fiction will enjoy being transported back to the middle part of the last century in this book. Spy aficionados will revel in the context of the Cold War era, and students of current tensions between the United States and Russia could gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between these two countries. <i>Betrayal </i>also speaks to history buffs and scholars of women in history who want to examine the changing perspectives of women over time.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Betrayal</i> inspires meaningful dialogue and the opportunity to reflect on questions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does one reconcile the different demands and pressures an individual faces as a parent and as a member of the world community?</li>
<li>How can we better navigate the betrayals of our own lives, when our beliefs and dreams don’t match reality?</li>
<li>What happens when our allies become our enemies, and when the opposite happens too?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!</p>

Or of US culture in all its faults as it pertained to nutrition, wellness and health. Or about the culture and methodology of start-ups, creating something new that's never been done before? All of it came with a bit of challenge to the status quo that most people in their belief systems, was too much.
It is still going to take me a lot of writing and research to take something as esoteric and topical such as spirituality something didactic and useful for the holistic practitioner or entrepreneur in everyday life, in the modus operandi. 
I need a website to leverage this AND OTHER powerful and wonderful information to clients, patients, friends, and followers among all the various social media platforms I frequent and all the fun I want to show to everyone of the real me, my story, and how I know spiritual growth and meditation is THE best route to riches, happiness, love, and purpose.I come in the form of many previous teachers: Eckhart Tolle, Abraham-Hicks, Gabrielle Bernstein, Deepak Chopra, Pema Chodron, Marie Forleo, Danielle LaPorte, Doreen Virtue (self-help, religion, meditation and spirituality authors) Nancy Grace (my college beat literature professor - a lot of inspiration for this came from the bohemian files of the beats), Joanne Frye (my college thesis advisor for my thesis ""The Word Made Flesh: Memoirs in Feminist Motherhood""), Dianne Connelly, Bob Duggan, Ivan Illich, Celeste Homan, Heidi Most, Thyme Gigliotti, Jeffrey Yuen (acupuncture professors/scholars), Jonathan Goldman, Liora Hill, and authors of the Earthlife series of channeled works,  Sanaya Roman & Duane Packer. Pagan tomes as well.I aim to help creative entrepreneurs and empaths incorporate spirituality into life without risking their personal identity or personal brand. These courses would be meditation-based for people to learn how to shield negativity and intuitive overwhelm in order to build a personal brand into a career and lifestyle with life-skills to boot. My new branding and coaching program will grow to include a course of e-books and personal one on one and group seminars for people to learn about their own intuitive skills and healing abilities.The money I am asking for includes recouping lindsaymacdougall.com for rebranding, taking an Angel Oracle Card Certification course and paying for my board exams to practice in DC.Overall this is going to contribute to a program that is part coaching, part spirituality, and 100% wellness oriented.Each one of us has a very unique purpose. We are being called to make a bigger impact on the world and to follow our dreams. We deserve to feel alive and excited about our work and to be able to build a life and a lifestyle that supports that and allows us to be fully free in ourselves and our self-expression to the world.As an entrepreneur, I understand what it's like to feel like there is something bigger out there that would use more of our intellect, our creativity, and our expertise that we feel deeply needs to get out there be recognized in the world. Teaching about the Law of Attraction while using simple channeling, soul retrieval, meditation and journaling techniques, these tools have proven to accelerate personal growth, strengthen intuitive skills and clear old patterns to empower a meaningful life with inspirational style.I have always wanted to run a spiritually-based business. In fact my blog was started two years ago towards that initiative. It was first a hobby for my writing, to teach and to learn more deeply about what I love talking about with people all the time. The blog had posts with titles like ""When Your Source of Inspiration Is Yourself,"" ""Subconscious Mind and Law of Attraction,"" & ""Allow Me To Solve All Your Problems,"" generating lots of comments and 'likes' for my newsletter and various social media sites.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Rachel, I’m creating a photojournalism book that will be a collection of portraits and interviews with survivors of sexual assault, emphasising how they found ways of working through those deeply difficult times. All personal profit made after publishing fees will be donated to The Sharan Project, a non-profit organisation who support victims of abuse and work towards ending violence against women and children.</p>
<p>I've been a professional photographer for nearly 9 years now and a large amount of my work is centred around empowering women, recent work includes shooting for So Just Shop (an online store allowing you to buy directly from women-led artisans throughout the world), I am the official photographer to burlesque women's rights activist Sukki Singapora, and I work closely with The Sharan Project supporting them as both a photographer and ambassador. </p>
<p>I've decided to write this book because I noticed something about the resources available to survivors. The paperwork you're provided with when you’re on the road to recovery is often quite clinical. Support workers understandably need to give you very clear, structured advice so you know the next steps to take and that is a wonderful, necessary approach to providing written material to those seeking help. But I’ve noticed there are far fewer warmer, more emotive reading materials available to work alongside the current text. I want for there to be a book where you can read other people’s stories, find out more about all the other ways an individual could aid their recovery. A book solely dedicated to survivors reaching out to other survivors, connecting with each other on a purely empathetic level. And therein lies this project - 100 interviews with 100 women and men supporting fellow survivors through story telling. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My biggest and most crucial expenses will be on travel and connecting with people who would like to be in the book.</p>
<p>Firstly, travel. Though I will be taking the coach wherever possible and will be strategic with timings so I can conduct more than one interview per trip to save money, I am still going to rack up a bill travelling up and down the country. Often I'll need to go to the interviewees home or meet them in a safe space of their choosing with their support worker, so travel money is essential.</p>
<p>Secondly, connecting with interviewees. There are now 2 billion active users on Facebook and so that's where I’m basing the majority of advertising. It's unfortunately quite costly, but after research and testing various other routes I am confident it's the most efficient way to reach people. I've already received enormous support from people across the country who have seen my sponsored facebook posts, now need to make sure I'm continuing to reach more and more potential interviewees in this way.<br/><br/>Lastly, smaller expenses. Many applicants have opted to meet for a coffee, others have also asked we use props to disguise their faces so they can remain anonymous. Although all those drinks and props don't cost much per meeting, when you add up 100 interviews worth of smaller expenses they will inevitably become a drain on the budget, so it's important I account for those odds and ends as well. </p>
<p>Now, perks! </p>
<p>There will be 4 main rewards for your help:<br/><br/><strong>£25</strong>: You are credited in the book as a supporter. <br/><strong>£50</strong>: You are credited in the book as a supporter and will receive a free portrait taken by myself in selected cities, on selected dates.<br/><strong>£75</strong>: You are credited in the book as a supporter and receive 15% discount on release. <br/><strong>£100</strong>+: You are credited in the book as a supporter and receive a free copy of the book on release.</p>
<p>Any additional money will be put back into the book. For example, if I raise more than my target amount I'll be able to hire city central spaces to conduct interviews making life easier for the interviewees and pay for additional advertising via Instagram and other social media platforms. Any money beyond that I will donate to The Sharan Project. <strong>£800 is the minimum amount I can manage this project with, any extra financial support would be so appreciated. </strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This book will be a warm, accessible resource for survivors of sexual assault. It'll be a way of connecting with others who have experienced similar things in a format that is currently unavailable as far as I know. I want to create an easy to read, open and honest book of stories told by some of the strongest people I've ever met. </p>
<p>When a person experiences sexual assault, there are countless way that person could find a way to recover. They'll consider all the different incredible organisations that are there to help, various kinds of counselling available, hobbies or projects that might help them work through everything. However, deciding how they're going to proceed is often one of the most difficult parts of the entire process. Being able to read through how other people have approached their recovery has potential to be an absolutely vital source of support and inspiration for survivors, a resource I'm going to work incredibly hard to create. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm anticipating there being a couple of challenges along the way. Firstly, I need to ensure the interviewee's are receiving the necessary specialist support or are looking to seek that help. Speaking about <font>potentially deeply hurtful experiences could be a </font>particularly taxing conversation so I need to be sure they have the support network they need to work through it. If that person requests additional help I can connect then with qualified support workers recommended by The Sharan Project who will step in and make sure they receive all the help they need. So please rest assured they interviewees well being will ALWAYS come first. <br/><br/>Another challenge will be photographing interviewees who have asked to remain anonymous. As this is a photojournalism book the accompanying imagery is a crucial part of the project, so I'll be using all my creative know-how that I've developed as a photographer over the last 9 years to shoot emotive images weather or not the person in the photo is identifiable. </p>

Hi! I'm Rachel, I’m creating a photojournalism book that will be a collection of portraits and interviews with survivors of sexual assault, emphasising how they found ways of working through those deeply difficult times. All personal profit made after publishing fees will be donated to The Sharan Project, a non-profit organisation who support victims of abuse and work towards ending violence against women and children.
I've been a professional photographer for nearly 9 years now and a large amount of my work is centred around empowering women, recent work includes shooting for So Just Shop (an online store allowing you to buy directly from women-led artisans throughout the world), I am the official photographer to burlesque women's rights activist Sukki Singapora, and I work closely with The Sharan Project supporting them as both a photographer and ambassador. 
I've decided to write this book because I noticed something about the resources available to survivors. The paperwork you're provided with when you’re on the road to recovery is often quite clinical. Support workers understandably need to give you very clear, structured advice so you know the next steps to take and that is a wonderful, necessary approach to providing written material to those seeking help. But I’ve noticed there are far fewer warmer, more emotive reading materials available to work alongside the current text. I want for there to be a book where you can read other people’s stories, find out more about all the other ways an individual could aid their recovery. A book solely dedicated to survivors reaching out to other survivors, connecting with each other on a purely empathetic level. And therein lies this project - 100 interviews with 100 women and men supporting fellow survivors through story telling. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
 
My biggest and most crucial expenses will be on travel and connecting with people who would like to be in the book.
Firstly, travel. Though I will be taking the coach wherever possible and will be strategic with timings so I can conduct more than one interview per trip to save money, I am still going to rack up a bill travelling up and down the country. Often I'll need to go to the interviewees home or meet them in a safe space of their choosing with their support worker, so travel money is essential.
Secondly, connecting with interviewees. There are now 2 billion active users on Facebook and so that's where I’m basing the majority of advertising. It's unfortunately quite costly, but after research and testing various other routes I am confident it's the most efficient way to reach people. I've already received enormous support from people across the country who have seen my sponsored facebook posts, now need to make sure I'm continuing to reach more and more potential interviewees in this way.Lastly, smaller expenses. Many applicants have opted to meet for a coffee, others have also asked we use props to disguise their faces so they can remain anonymous. Although all those drinks and props don't cost much per meeting, when you add up 100 interviews worth of smaller expenses they will inevitably become a drain on the budget, so it's important I account for those odds and ends as well. 
Now, perks! 
There will be 4 main rewards for your help:£25: You are credited in the book as a supporter. £50: You are credited in the book as a supporter and will receive a free portrait taken by myself in selected cities, on selected dates.£75: You are credited in the book as a supporter and receive 15% discount on release. £100+: You are credited in the book as a supporter and receive a free copy of the book on release.
Any additional money will be put back into the book. For example, if I raise more than my target amount I'll be able to hire city central spaces to conduct interviews making life easier for the interviewees and pay for additional advertising via Instagram and other social media platforms. Any money beyond that I will donate to The Sharan Project. £800 is the minimum amount I can manage this project with, any extra financial support would be so appreciated.

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p>1 Week, 1 Thing - Freedom for the business owner to find peace and unimaginable breakthroughs in just 3 pages a week!<br/><br/>My name is Jeffrey Nott and I am the author of 1 Week, 1 Thing. I wrote this book to help business owners get the big things done in their business that they have not been able to do so before. In personal experience of owning multiple businesses and working with many other business owners, I discovered that one can get more done by focusing on just one big area (HR manual, Processes, etc.) of their business each week rather than 2 or 3 things at once. This book uses classic business tools for you, the owner, to facilitate this process to create a well oiled machine.<br/><br/>Owning a business is like juggling. Every day you are asked to juggle different priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Strategy</li>
<li>Human Resources</li>
<li>Operations and Finance</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Sales</li>
</ul>
<p>This book gives you a balanced approach to keeping all the balls in the air while working on each of these areas in a one year time frame. Some of the issues that challenge the typical business owner in doing so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus - If you are ADHD (like me) or distracted by too many things</li>
<li>Time - You are challenged b (like me) in any given day to complete an important task</li>
<li>Skill - Your skill (or just desire - like me) keeps you working on easier tasks instead</li>
</ul>
<p>The chapters are structured to address the issues listed above and helps you, the reader, to work on and through every key area of your business on a cyclical basis.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you ready for real breakthroughs in getting those things done that you know need to be addressed.</p>
<p><br/>1 Week, 1 Thing is a non-fiction book that speaks to small to medium business owners who are looking at working less <i>in</i> the business and more <i>on</i> the business for the first time.</p>

<p>The book is written in 3 sections:</p>
<p>Section 1 - Introduction to the book and how to use it.</p>
<p>Section 2 - What to do if you need a fast fix to an immediate need.</p>
<p>Section 3 - Takes the business owner on a one week at a time basis through the most important parts of building a successful business. The end result is that the business owner will have the most important moving parts of the business in place, allowing time (freedom), peace of mind and the money for that much needed 2 week vacation that most business owners almost never take.<br/> </p>

Jeff has spoken to audiences of many sizes on different topics, including keynote, event planning, goal setting, and especially business topics.<br/><br/>Jeffrey wrote this book out of his desire to help the business owner finally get the business they have always wanted.

<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Story of My Book </span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Imagine shooting photos out of a helicopter with no doors. Being dropped off in the middle of a Zimbabwean jungle to shoot a story about rhino horn poachers, only to find out that you were on your own. Or finding yourself challenging the messages that you were assigned to shoot after having finished the assignment. Sometimes you have to go to great lengths to get the shot. It’s all just part of the job for the talented women who’ve paved the way for future generations of photographers. Their work appears in glossy publications, on national news sites, and in your social media feed, but unless you slow down to read the photo credits, you’d never realize how few of the images you see every day were actually taken by women photographers.</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Sophia Nunn and I’m the author of <i>Framing The Shot</i>. Feeling lost after being sent home in March because of the Coronavirus Pandemic, I reflected on what I could do now that I didn’t have time to do while on campus at Georgetown. I decided that this time was the perfect opportunity to use my voice and to create something meaningful. I wrote this book to highlight the powerful work that women have been doing for decades as photographers and to bring into focus their under-representation in the photography industry. </span><br/><br/><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Framing The Shot</i> is a book about women photographers, strategies for success, and representation. Featuring interviews with thirteen notable women photographers, <i>Framing The Shot</i> combines the stories of these photographers with advice on how to explore your own passion for photography. The book highlights the tools that successful women photographers have used to build their own careers while considering the greater context of women in the workforce. Many of these women are entrepreneurs, businesswomen, and consultants. Some of them are also photography teachers and professors. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">My hope is that by hearing their diverse perspectives you’ll gain a more three-dimensional understanding of women in the photography industry. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn from the work and careers of these women while challenging what you know about photography’s history. I hope that from <i>Framing The Shot</i>, you gain a greater understanding of the importance of representation in the photography industry.</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you’re interested in hearing stories from war photographers, reading about the entrepreneurial drive of freelancers, or learning about how crucial ethical visual journalism is in today’s world, this book is for you. You will love this book if you want to read about empowered women, learn more about photography as a method of storytelling, or discover new strategies for success. <br/><br/><i>Framing The Shot</i> speaks to women, photographers, and entrepreneurs looking to read about the impact that women photographers have had on the world, to learn more about the photography industry, and to identify the steps needed to build their own brand.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Framing The Shot </i>inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</span></p>

Part 1 also examines why diversity and representation matter and introduces notable women photographers. It dives into more specific fields within the photography industry and examines industry trends. According to data tracking by Women Photograph, in 2017, only 18.2 percent of published news photographs were taken by women. Progress is a slow, hard battle— for the year 2020 up until the week of November 16th, the number of published news photos taken by women had only risen to 19.8 percent.

Part 2 also discusses visual storytelling at length and highlights the importance of de-colonizing the lens, engaging in ethical photojournalism, and deconstructing the white male gaze. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> consists of the final chapter: a compilation of the advice from the different women that I interviewed. Though the advice was given in the context of the photography industry, much of what they advise is applicable to other fields as well.

Sophia chose to study Psychology because she’s always been fascinated by how we develop as people.

Causing her to reflect a great deal on social constructions, Psychology of Sexuality was also the reason that she decided to pursue a minor in Women’s and Gender Studies. Sophia read a great deal about identity in her Introduction to Philosophy class, which spurred her interest in Philosophy and considering what our role is as humans in the world. <br/><br/>Passionate about photography and keen to make a difference in the lives of girls and women, Sophia decided to write <i>Framing The Shot</i>.

Imagine shooting photos out of a helicopter with no doors. Being dropped off in the middle of a Zimbabwean jungle to shoot a story about rhino horn poachers, only to find out that you were on your own. Or finding yourself challenging the messages that you were assigned to shoot after having finished the assignment. Sometimes you have to go to great lengths to get the shot. It’s all just part of the job for the talented women who’ve paved the way for future generations of photographers. Their work appears in glossy publications, on national news sites, and in your social media feed, but unless you slow down to read the photo credits, you’d never realize how few of the images you see every day were actually taken by women photographers.My name is Sophia Nunn and I’m the author of Framing The Shot. Feeling lost after being sent home in March because of the Coronavirus Pandemic, I reflected on what I could do now that I didn’t have time to do while on campus at Georgetown. I decided that this time was the perfect opportunity to use my voice and to create something meaningful. I wrote this book to highlight the powerful work that women have been doing for decades as photographers and to bring into focus their under-representation in the photography industry. Framing The Shot is a book about women photographers, strategies for success, and representation. Featuring interviews with thirteen notable women photographers, Framing The Shot combines the stories of these photographers with advice on how to explore your own passion for photography. The book highlights the tools that successful women photographers have used to build their own careers while considering the greater context of women in the workforce. Many of these women are entrepreneurs, businesswomen, and consultants. Some of them are also photography teachers and professors. 
My hope is that by hearing their diverse perspectives you’ll gain a more three-dimensional understanding of women in the photography industry. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn from the work and careers of these women while challenging what you know about photography’s history. I hope that from Framing The Shot, you gain a greater understanding of the importance of representation in the photography industry.If you’re interested in hearing stories from war photographers, reading about the entrepreneurial drive of freelancers, or learning about how crucial ethical visual journalism is in today’s world, this book is for you. You will love this book if you want to read about empowered women, learn more about photography as a method of storytelling, or discover new strategies for success. Framing The Shot speaks to women, photographers, and entrepreneurs looking to read about the impact that women photographers have had on the world, to learn more about the photography industry, and to identify the steps needed to build their own brand.Ultimately, I hope that Framing The Shot inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:

What does it mean to be a woman in the photography industry?
How does your identity influence what you notice and ultimately what and how you choose to photograph? 
What steps should I take to pursue my own passion? 

 
I believe that discussing how photography intersects with identity and encouraging young people to follow their passions will change us all for the better, and I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.  The Book - Framing The ShotFraming the Shot is written in three parts.

I wrote this book so that millions of teens can visualize achieving their greatest potential, by believing they can make a difference and influence change, no matter what circumstance they find themselves in––home, school or their communities.<br/><br/>I was inspired to write Leadership Principles for Teens after my experience as the CEO of a program in the Chicago public schools. We helped hundreds of students who were suspended from school to get back on track. We did this by teaching important life lessons - like improving self-image, forming more positive relationships, making better decisions, and resisting peer pressure.<br/><br/>I witnessed a transformation in students attitude and behavior when they were shown and taught these skills. It wasn’t just me, parents and teachers were seeing positive changes too: Grades and attendance were improving, students were more engaged at school, they getting along with others better, and having more meaningful conversations at home. Parents constantly asked why their more aware and confident kids had to get in trouble to learn these valuable lessons.<br/><br/><strong><i>I knew there had to be a better way.</i></strong></p><ul>
<li>A better way to get these effective social emotional learning lessons into the hands of people who have a passion to inspire youth.</li>
<li>A better way for teens to learn meaningful life skills that are so important to job preparedness and post graduate success.</li>
<li>A better way to prepare teens to take the lead on their own life-- so it wasn’t just the few thousand we helped, but thousands of teenagers around the world.</li>
</ul><p>So after four years of this fulfilling work, I decided not to renew the public school contract so that I could get these powerful lessons into the hands of more educators who could influence even more of our youth.<br/><br/><strong>My hope is </strong>that, in using this book, educators are able to reinforce important life skills that teach teens that a life marathon is not so much about instant gratification and making an immediate impact, but a journey of ups and downs...wins and losses. Their greatest success will involve strong relationships and building trust. Teens will see that love wins over hate, and living with integrity and gratitude brings lifelong happiness, among many other lessons.<br/><br/>In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have to inspire youth success. Youth are our greatest resource. The better job we do of providing skills, resources and preparing them to take the lead, what ever they face in their life, the better chance they have for long term success.<br/><br/>And then ultimately I want you to see this book as an educators tool to be the one that makes a difference in a teens life. Now’s your chance to be the ONE. The one that motivated your students to reach their highest potential and helped each one recognize his or her tremendous value.</p><p> </p><h3>About this book</h3><p>This is my book of passion. For the past three years, I did my research on outstanding leaders. I do not expect anyone to clock the hundreds of hours of documentaries, museum visits, reading autobiographies, biographies, to come up with a short list of greats and decipher what it made them successful. I did that. Synthesizing all the information into an easy to read format is my contribution to the world.</p><p>Drawing on our history’s proven best leaders, we can learn, understand and model the best practices they used to discover their purpose, make decisions, solve problems, connect with others, persist no matter what and model a life of integrity. </p><p>In this book students will learn and practice the best practices from some of our greatest leaders that include Abraham Lincoln, Eleanor Roosevelt, Cesar Chavez, Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi as well as current stand outs like Lin Manuel Miranda and the Parkland School survivors. Readers will see that life and leadership skills are as important and relevant today as they were through out history.</p><p>By using storytelling and discussion I hope to create unforgettable adventure so that educators and students will enjoy, remember and apply these life fundamental skills to their daily life - and for the rest of their life!</p><p><strong>You will love this book if </strong>you are an educator, school administrators, teen leader who wants to inspire youth to live to their potential. You will have ideas, thoughts, and a guide on developing skills and creating confidence in children leaving your legacy as a true change maker promoting teen success, not only now but for generations to come.<br/><br/><i>Leadership Principles for Teens </i>is a non-fiction book that is a tool for educators (6th grade and up) who are looking for a learning solution that gives them confidence and life lessons that are easily folded into daily classroom lessons. Lessons that will grow the qualities of purpose, drive, compassion and integrity in young emerging leaders – whether it is in their communities, families or the world.</p><p> </p><h3>The Book - Leadership Principles for Teens</h3><p>The book is for educators and students to use over the school year, one chapter per week. The book is written in the following 7 Parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part 1: INTRODUCTION</strong> includes a brief description of some of our greatest leaders.  Readers will be introduced to the idea that no matter who they are, where they are from, what means they have, they can create change in their own lives.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2: SELF AWARENESS</strong> contains Chapters 1-4. In part 2  readers will learn about the importance of self-love. They will be encouraged to pay attention and identify their own unique skills, strengths, and values.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3: SELF MANAGEMENT</strong> contains Chapters 5-11. The focus of this section is understanding emotions or our feelings. Our feelings are the clues that guide us to follow our love-based emotions or reconsider our fear-based emotions. Readers will understand different strategies to successfully manage impulse control and keep a positive attitude.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4: SOCIAL AWARENESS </strong>contains Chapters 12-19. Readers will examine how those they surround themselves with inspire their success —or not. Establishing and maintaining healthy relationships, appreciating diversity, listening well and respecting another opinion are included in this section.<br/><br/><strong>Part 5: RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIORS </strong>contains Chapters 20-25. Setting and working toward personal and academic goals and making responsible decisions are covered in this section. Topics like knowing when to say yes or no and making honorable choices are also included.<br/><br/><strong>Part 6: SELF IMPROVEMENT </strong>contains Chapters 26-28. A growth mindset is the theme in this section. There are many ways to cultivate learning. We grow when we challenge our comfort zone, believe in our self-confidence and get unafraid to make mistakes.<br/><br/><strong>Part 7: TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR LIFE </strong>contains Chapters 29-33. Students will learn that we are 100% responsible for our own actions. Being able to accept and welcome feedback is necessary and fosters self-love. This section includes topics like quit blaming, being honest and not being afraid to ask for what you need or want.<br/><br/><strong>Part 8: NOW WHAT!</strong> contains Chapters 34-37. Readers will learn they can take the lead by voting and serving others. Additionally, anyone, regardless of who they are or what means they came from, can make a difference.<br/> </p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p class=""p1"">My name is Josh LeRoy. I’m married to Laura, and I’m the dad of Anna Grace and Ellis. I live in North Carolina, where I work with a ministry called The Bridge Project. This is a ministry within the beautifully diverse East Side community. I also like to write, and I’ve put together a short book entitled Deeper than your Pain. As should be obvious by the title, it’s a book about pain. More specifically, it’s a book about the spiritual/emotional/physical pain that results from internalized rejection; a pain that has become an epidemic within the organized church. If you were raised in a context where performance was obligatory, then there’s a good chance that you swallowed your fair share of rejection. No matter how well you perform, your performance will never be “perfect”. Performance oriented environments are shame-based, and they fuel the fear of Gods absence. When you fail to be perfect, you assume that God has rejected you. But God never created you to be perfect, and your very existence is proof that He has not rejected you. Healing happens when you awaken to the presence of God. God is not just present; He is presence itself….all that we know of reality and then some. To be knowingly and willingly in His presence is to be healthy and whole. Contributions to this project will help us get that message to the souls who need reminding.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am an engineer with a little bit inhibited creativity. I have therefore written a detective novel about the swedish summer, the beautiful archepalago of Bohuslän in the west of sweden but mainly is it about ordinary guys that become heroes.

<p>I am so extremely impatient to get it printed but my wife asks me to save money to this before I print it. I also would like to give a few Euro to persons that have contributed to the book.

<p> </p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<p><em>It was the same dream Edith had almost every night: kneeling by Harold’s grave, fixing the <a class=""FAtxtL"" href=""http://www.iwriteromance.com/jdcarter/"" id=""FALINK_1_0_0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">flowers</a> the wind had knocked over the night before. His name was etched in the stone under his favorite quote:</em> Behind every great man, there is an even greater woman. <em>They had cared so much for each other. He had been the first and only man Edith had ever truly loved.</em></p>
<p><em>“That’s good.” Edith looked over the arrangement. “You would really love these, Harold. They would have really brought out your eyes.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes. They are beautiful.” Harold agreed.</em></p>
<p><em>“The best I had in the store. Only the best for my precious Harold.” Tears formed in Edith’s eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>“Don’t cry, my heart. You will be with me soon enough.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Oh Harold.” Edith wiped the tears from her eyes. “I miss you so.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I know, my heart. I miss you too. It won’t be long, though. We will be together before you know it.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes. The kids, though. They need me.”</em></p>
<p><em>“They are selfish. When was the last time you even heard from them? A week? A month?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Mary and her husband, Derek, came by last month.”</em></p>
<p><em>“They needed money to fund one of their <a class=""FAtxtL"" href=""http://www.iwriteromance.com/jdcarter/"" id=""FALINK_2_0_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">trips</a>, didn’t they?”</em></p>
<p><em>Edith shook as her emotions almost got the best of her. “Yes. They took the kids to one of those amusement parks down in Florida.” Edith laughed. “You should have seen how excited they were. They were just beaming.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Of course! You were giving them money. Money that I worked all of those years for. God, you’re weak.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Harold, please…” Edith’s voice trailed off and tears poured from her eyes as her emotions overcame her.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s true! They know that all they have to do is call up their Mommy and they can get whatever they want. That’s the only thing that matters to those spoiled little brats anymore. Other than that, what do they care about you?” Harold spoke with an anger Edith had never heard before.</em></p>
<p><em>“Nothing, I <a class=""FAtxtL"" href=""http://www.iwriteromance.com/jdcarter/"" id=""FALINK_3_0_2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">guess</a>. Those grandkids, though, they love me to death. They would have loved you, too.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Would they have?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes. I think they would have. They are such a joy.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Brats.” The response came back harsh and flat.</em></p>
<p><em>“No. They aren’t like their parents.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Not yet. But they will be.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Maybe.” Edith whispered.</em></p>
<p><em>Edith looked at her hands as if they held an answer to her hoplessness. The anguish of being alone and the anger in Harold’s voice shook her. “I just wish you were here, Harold. You would know what to do.”</em></p>
<p><em>“If I were there, they wouldn’t have turned out so shitty.”</em></p>
<p><em>Edith had never heard Harold curse and it jolted her as if she had been struck by lightning. “What?”</em></p>
<p><em>“You heard me. You have spoiled our children and their kids are going to turn out the exact same way. What kind of mother or grandmother are you?”</em></p>
<p><em>Edith couldn’t believe her ears. Was this really how Harold felt? No. It couldn’t be. Harold would never curse at her. He never got angry enough to curse at her. He most surely wouldn’t have called her worthless.</em></p>
<p><em>Suddenly, hands burst through the dirt that lay over the top of Harold’s grave and grabbed Edith’s wrists. Her eyes widened and she struggled against them.</em></p>
<p><em>“Time to come home, Edith. Time to stop fucking up our kids and let them find out how hard life is when they don’t have their Mommy around to save them.” The hands tightened around Edith’s wrists.</em></p>
<p><em>“No. Please, Harold. Please let me go. You’re hurting me.”</em></p>
<p><em>Vines snaked out of the ground beside Edith and wrapped themselves around her ankles. She screamed as the ground in front of her separated to reveal Harold’s coffin. The top burst open and Harold’s gruesome, deteriorated remains rose up. “It’s time to come home, Edith” He grinned through blackened, rotted teeth.</em></p>
<p><em>“No. Please, Harold, no.” The vines crept up Edith’s legs. She grabbed at them and they grabbed back, curling their way up her arms.</em></p>
<p><em>Suddenly, Edith was being pulled closer toward her own plot. The ground tore open and she saw teeth growing out of the sides. On the bottom, there was a giant tongue whipping around as if it were licking its lips.</em></p>
<p><em>Harold laughed maliciously as his head turned to the side, watching the pitiful fight Edith was putting up against the vines.</em></p>
<p><em>Edith screamed as she was pulled into her grave.</em></p>
<p><em>She screamed as the last bit of light from the sun was blocked out by the ground closing over her.</em></p>

Excerpt:
It was the same dream Edith had almost every night: kneeling by Harold’s grave, fixing the flowers the wind had knocked over the night before. His name was etched in the stone under his favorite quote: Behind every great man, there is an even greater woman. They had cared so much for each other.

“Nothing, I guess. Those grandkids, though, they love me to death. They would have loved you, too.”
“Would they have?”
“Yes. I think they would have. They are such a joy.”
“Brats.” The response came back harsh and flat.

<p>Why am I--an established author, speaker, &amp; business owner--crowdfunding this book?  To give you the opportunity join my virtual research team. I've been writing this book for over two years, and am about 80% finished. But I'm crowdsourcing the remaining 20%, asking you to offer stories from your own community or personal expereince for possble inclusion in the book. I might even quote you in the book, if you have a good insight.</p>
<p>Once this crowdfunding campaign is complete, ALL backers (you) will receive an invitation from me to submit ideas, insights (I might quote you in the book), and stories from your community.</p>
<p>In this new book (my third) you'll discover how to join the ranks of the renewal renegades who are making communities healthier, wealthier, happier, &amp; more beautiful for a living. Here's more information about <strong>RECIVILIZING: <em>The Surprising Ways that Crowd Technologies Renew Citis, Nature, Democracy, and Livelihoods.</em></strong></p>
<p>In this book, you'll discover how a perfect storm of converging trends and crises makes NOW the ideal time to launch a living you love, revitalizing some aspect of your local community or region. Here they are:</p>
<p><strong>3 TRENDS:</strong> Crowd Tech + Social Enterprise + Citizen-Led Renewal.<br/><strong>3 CRISES:</strong> Our Economy + Our Environment + Our Institutional Failures. <br/><strong>OUTCOME:</strong> A revitalizing explosion of local projects, jobs, &amp; businesses.</p>
<p>Their recivilizing weapon? <strong>Crowd Technologies.  </strong>With these tools, we can activate what I call the ""<strong>Paradise Loop</strong>"": <em>When we restore our world, our world restores us</em>.</p>
<p><strong>My definition of ""paradise""?</strong> Any place that's being reborn...that's coming back to life..or that's already healthy, wealthy, happy, and beautiful, and is getting more so. Nature hates stasis. There's something magic about being around the energy of regeneration. There's even more magic in being the one who's helping that regeneration happen.</p>
<p>So, who are these ""renewal renegades""? They are the entrepreneurs, the investors, the professionals, the unemployed, and the dispossessed who see problems in their community, and who want to turn them into opportunities.</p>
<p>A vacant house can be seen as a problem that drives down property values, or it can be seen as a restorable asset that can revitalize the community. It can be renovated and reused, or it can be torn down and the property turned into a playground or community garden that enhances property values. This same principle applies to all of your community's built, natural, and social assets.</p>
<p>If you no longer have a job or savings, you probably have a wealth of available time. Using that time to participate in local citizen-led renewal can be the path to highly-marketable, personally-satisfying new skills. If you do still have a job and savings, participating in local citizen-led renewal can be the path to wonderful new business and investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Local ""recivil wars"" against heavy-handed, obstructive, and/or risk-averse public and private institutions are revitalizing our besieged livelihoods, cities, democracies, and natural resources. Don't worry: recivil wars are peaceful, joyful, profitable, and cooperative. They are recivilizing our world, and just in time. ReCivil wars are the cure for what ails 99% of us.</p>
<p>In this introductory 8-minute video (above), you'll discover the ""good side"" of the current economic disaster: the ""perfect storm"" of crises and technologies that launched the crowdfunded, citizen-led community renewal trend. Using just your computer or smart phone, you can now fix your local environment, economy, society, and government...while quickly creating an ideal career for yourself.</p>
<p>You can pre-order <strong><em>RECIVILIZING</em></strong> right here, right now, via this crowdfunding campaign. Depending on the ""reward"" level you chose, you can even receive an advance copy of the completed manuscript, months before the rest of the world sees the book. This will give you, your organization, or your community a head start of this powerful new trend.</p>
<p>Citizen-led renewal is the long-term solution to your community's revitalization, but it can be the immediate solution to your ""personal revitalization"".</p>
<p><strong>WHAT:</strong> I'm self-publishing my third book, <strong><em>RECIVILIZING</em></strong>.  You can pre-order your copy, here and now, to help bring this book to the world. It's your guidebook to revitalizing your career, your life, and your community simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN:</strong> <strong><em>RECIVILIZING</em></strong> will be published in early 2013. But you can receive a PDF of the complete manuscript about two months early if you choose one of the preview reward levels of this crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p><strong>WHY:</strong> Does what we've done to nature break your heart? Does economic inequity sadden you? Do change-resistant institutions--the ones that are supposed to be solving our local, national, and global problems--frustrate you? Does the capture of government by Big Money interests anger you?</p>
<p>If so, <strong><em>RECIVILIZING</em></strong> might be the best news you've ever read. You're invited to help make this book a reality by pre-ordering your copy via this campaign. You can also get an early copy of the finished manuscript, about two months ahead of the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>WHO AM I?</strong> My name is Storm Cunningham. I'm CEO of <strong>ReCitizen</strong>, a startup organization in Washington DC. Our mission is to create a global network of citizen-led regeneration efforts. We will provide online tools to facilitate these initiatives free of charge to communities worldwide.</p>

<p><strong>WHY AM I SELF-PUBLISHING?</strong> McGraw-Hill paid me a $25,000 advance (no complaints there) for my 2008 book, <em>Rewealth</em>. It was the first book to document a proven process for community revitalization. But, this Fortune 500 company deleted an entire chapter on what was wrong with the U.S. economy. They said it was ""negative"" concerning Wall Street and giant corporations. That book came out in 2008, just as the U.S. economy crashed. The book got great reviews, but I wish it included that chapter.</p>
<p>I'm self-publishing this new book via Amazon's CreateSpace service. As a result, I can tell the unvarnished truth about the public and private institutions that are killing nature and damaging society. More important, I'm going to demonstrate how citizens in small towns and large cities are now BYPASSING these roadblocks to restoring and revitalizing our communities, our planet, and democracy.</p>
<p>We're poised for paradise, if your idea of paradise is healing and revitalizing our communities and our planet. Want to take part?</p>
<p>Thank you! - Storm</p>
<p>P.S. - Two notes about what you'll see in the video:</p>
<p>1) It's a victim of global warming. The sequences were shot during the hottest week in Washington DC's recorded history. Between the temperature and the humidity, the perceived heat was close to 120F. So, if I look a bit flushed or wilted, that's why.</p>
<p>2) The book cover is just a placeholder I created myself. When the book is close to publication, and the cover copy has been finalized, a professional artist will design the cover. There's a lot of text on the front cover right now, but some of it will eventually be moved to the back cover.</p></div>","Discover the renewal renegades who practice the art of revitalizing cities & nature for a living. Their secret weapon? Crowd technologies, combined with two powerful trends: Social Enterprises, and Citizen-Led Renewal.
Why am I--an established author, speaker, & business owner--crowdfunding this book?  To give you the opportunity join my virtual research team. I've been writing this book for over two years, and am about 80% finished. But I'm crowdsourcing the remaining 20%, asking you to offer stories from your own community or personal expereince for possble inclusion in the book. I might even quote you in the book, if you have a good insight.
Once this crowdfunding campaign is complete, ALL backers (you) will receive an invitation from me to submit ideas, insights (I might quote you in the book), and stories from your community.
In this new book (my third) you'll discover how to join the ranks of the renewal renegades who are making communities healthier, wealthier, happier, & more beautiful for a living. Here's more information about RECIVILIZING: The Surprising Ways that Crowd Technologies Renew Citis, Nature, Democracy, and Livelihoods.
In this book, you'll discover how a perfect storm of converging trends and crises makes NOW the ideal time to launch a living you love, revitalizing some aspect of your local community or region. Here they are:
3 TRENDS: Crowd Tech + Social Enterprise + Citizen-Led Renewal.3 CRISES: Our Economy + Our Environment + Our Institutional Failures. OUTCOME: A revitalizing explosion of local projects, jobs, & businesses.
Their recivilizing weapon? Crowd Technologies.  With these tools, we can activate what I call the ""Paradise Loop"": When we restore our world, our world restores us.
My definition of ""paradise""? Any place that's being reborn...that's coming back to life..or that's already healthy, wealthy, happy, and beautiful, and is getting more so. Nature hates stasis. There's something magic about being around the energy of regeneration. There's even more magic in being the one who's helping that regeneration happen.
So, who are these ""renewal renegades""? They are the entrepreneurs, the investors, the professionals, the unemployed, and the dispossessed who see problems in their community, and who want to turn them into opportunities.
A vacant house can be seen as a problem that drives down property values, or it can be seen as a restorable asset that can revitalize the community. It can be renovated and reused, or it can be torn down and the property turned into a playground or community garden that enhances property values. This same principle applies to all of your community's built, natural, and social assets.
If you no longer have a job or savings, you probably have a wealth of available time. Using that time to participate in local citizen-led renewal can be the path to highly-marketable, personally-satisfying new skills. If you do still have a job and savings, participating in local citizen-led renewal can be the path to wonderful new business and investment opportunities.
Local ""recivil wars"" against heavy-handed, obstructive, and/or risk-averse public and private institutions are revitalizing our besieged livelihoods, cities, democracies, and natural resources. Don't worry: recivil wars are peaceful, joyful, profitable, and cooperative. They are recivilizing our world, and just in time. ReCivil wars are the cure for what ails 99% of us.
In this introductory 8-minute video (above), you'll discover the ""good side"" of the current economic disaster: the ""perfect storm"" of crises and technologies that launched the crowdfunded, citizen-led community renewal trend. Using just your computer or smart phone, you can now fix your local environment, economy, society, and government...while quickly creating an ideal career for yourself.
You can pre-order RECIVILIZING right here, right now, via this crowdfunding campaign. Depending on the ""reward"" level you chose, you can even receive an advance copy of the completed manuscript, months before the rest of the world sees the book. This will give you, your organization, or your community a head start of this powerful new trend.
Citizen-led renewal is the long-term solution to your community's revitalization, but it can be the immediate solution to your ""personal revitalization"".
WHAT: I'm self-publishing my third book, RECIVILIZING.  You can pre-order your copy, here and now, to help bring this book to the world. It's your guidebook to revitalizing your career, your life, and your community simultaneously.
WHEN: RECIVILIZING will be published in early 2013. But you can receive a PDF of the complete manuscript about two months early if you choose one of the preview reward levels of this crowdfunding campaign.
WHY: Does what we've done to nature break your heart? Does economic inequity sadden you? Do change-resistant institutions--the ones that are supposed to be solving our local, national, and global problems--frustrate you? Does the capture of government by Big Money interests anger you?
If so, RECIVILIZING might be the best news you've ever read. You're invited to help make this book a reality by pre-ordering your copy via this campaign. You can also get an early copy of the finished manuscript, about two months ahead of the rest of the world.
WHO AM I? My name is Storm Cunningham. I'm CEO of ReCitizen, a startup organization in Washington DC. Our mission is to create a global network of citizen-led regeneration efforts. We will provide online tools to facilitate these initiatives free of charge to communities worldwide.
George Ochs, Managing Partner at JP Morgan generously calls me: ""...the world's thought leader on community revitalization and natural resource restoration.""

<p>Flux Webzine is a Brisbane-based, Queensland-focused online magazine, which provides industry information and showcased work from the local design industry. The webzine is a creation of Flux Collective – a group of 3 design students with a passion and yearning to contribute their creativity to the industry that has inspired them. The goal is to grow Flux Webzine to a larger publication so that it can become a major platform for emerging designers to gain exposure, and learn about successful designers in their locale.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who is Flux Collective?</h3>
<p>As mentioned, Flux Collective is a creative collective currently made up of 3 emerging graphic designers – Mish Stark, Ben Smith and Jeremy Swanborough. All high-performers at University, they share a keen interest in making an ongoing contribution to the design industry in Queensland and came together to combine their forces to create something of meaning and value.</p>
<p>Ben is the Flux Collective magazine specialist and composition guru, with a keen interest in moving the webzine forward to encompass Rich Media functionality. He is also the Project Manager, keeps the team on schedule, and takes care of file and data management. Mish specializes in Branding and can be described as a pseudo-Creative Director – she holds the main vision and oversees general content creation and quality control. Jeremy is the Flux web and technology specialist. He is responsible for the creation, overall design, development and maintenance of the Flux Collective website. Together, their individual talents, skill sets and experiences lay a solid foundation for a successful venture.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Campaign</h3>
<p>Flux Webzine has been in operation in its current form for 3 months and has quickly gained a significant following in Brisbane. With over 1800 Flux Webzine views so far, we believe that there is a definite market for the publication to grow and extend our scope to encompass all of Queensland, and possibly other related design disciplines.</p>
<p>Our Indiegogo campaign comes as a result of us needing extra funds to reach our larger goal. As volunteers, we put significant time into a non-commercial not-for-profit venture, and thus have no commercial income stream to support future growth. Contributors will help us to improve, expand and continue to publish Flux Webzine. The effects of your contribution towards Flux Webzine will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing a positive role in how design is perceived within the industry and by the larger community</li>
<li>Enable young and emerging designers to gain exposure and kickstart their careers</li>
<li>Show the creative talent that is often overlooked in Queensland in favour of major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne – and thus making these cities recognize Queensland design as a significant creative force.</li>
<li>Allow creative and interested parties to gain inspiration and knowledge about Graphic Design and associated industries.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3>Where will your contribution go?</h3>
<p>We have a specific vision of what your contributions will help with, and these are outlined below. However, our creative goals in relation to Flux Webzine are limitless! So if our campaign contributions go above and beyond our initial goal, we will be able to grow and develop the project even further.</p>
<div>
<p>To celebrate our 10<sup>th</sup> issue we plan to release a ‘bumper’ edition of Flux Webzine, which will hopefully include a Rich Media iPad design - setting the stage for the bigger and better Flux Webzine in 2013. The bumper edition will celebrate our past issues and include new features and unreleased content!</p>
</div>
<p>A rich media magazine design is basically a magazine designed specifically for viewing on a digital tablet, as they behave like websites and are incredibly interactive. Consequently, this magazine publication platform is becoming increasingly popular and forging new industry standards.</p>
<p>Whilst development of the traditional bumper edition will cost time and money, there are also a few key requirements for creating a Rich Media Magazine design - which is where we need your help! The two key costs include purchasing an Adobe Digital Publishing Suite license (AUD$400) and an iTunes developer member ship (AUD$100). Your assistance with these costs will allow us to purchase these licenses and publish the FREE rich media magazine on iTunes!</p>
<div>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal and aren’t able to publish a Rich Media magazine, your contributions will still significantly assist in the creation of a traditional bumper edition and the expansion of Flux Webzine in 2013.</p>

<div>
<a href=""http://www.legacybookspress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Legacy Books Press</a> was founded in 2007 as a micro press specializing in non-fiction history books – books about those corners of history that aren’t always explored, but still helped shape the world we live in today.  Our titles include the critically acclaimed <em>The Secret History of Star Wars</em>, by Michael Kaminski, <em>The War that Changed the World</em>, by John-Allen Price, and <em>Bayonets and Blobsticks</em>, by Aaron Taylor Miedema.  They are wonderful books by amazing authors.  But, there was a problem.<br/><br/><img alt=""How I Filmed the Great War cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.legacybookspress.com/Books/FilmedWar.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px; float: left;""/>As a micro-press, Legacy Books Press lacked the reach that would get these books onto public library shelves, so that readers could enjoy them again and again.  The distribution network was there, but the ability to get the libraries’ attention was lacking.  In the last year, we have begun our transition into a small press, hiring The Cadence Group (now <a href=""http://www.newshelvesdistribution.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New Shelves Distribution</a>) to handle the sales effort.  With Cadence’s track record, we were certain that we could finally reach out to the libraries and give these books – and their authors – the attention they deserved.<br/><br/>So, a campaign was planned to bring these wonderful books to the attention of libraries across North America.  The books for the campaign were printed and shipped to The Cadence Group – everything was ready.  And then, disaster struck.  Due to circumstances beyond anybody’s control, Legacy Books Press ended up underfunded by over $4,000.  There was no choice – for the business to continue operations, the library campaign had to be put on an indefinite hold.<br/><br/>But with your help, we can raise the money to help bring these amazing books onto library shelves, where they can be enjoyed by thousands upon thousands of readers across North America.  Help us bring history books to libraries now!</div>

Legacy Books Press was founded in 2007 as a micro press specializing in non-fiction history books – books about those corners of history that aren’t always explored, but still helped shape the world we live in today.  Our titles include the critically acclaimed The Secret History of Star Wars, by Michael Kaminski, The War that Changed the World, by John-Allen Price, and Bayonets and Blobsticks, by Aaron Taylor Miedema.  They are wonderful books by amazing authors.  But, there was a problem.As a micro-press, Legacy Books Press lacked the reach that would get these books onto public library shelves, so that readers could enjoy them again and again.  The distribution network was there, but the ability to get the libraries’ attention was lacking.  In the last year, we have begun our transition into a small press, hiring The Cadence Group (now New Shelves Distribution) to handle the sales effort.  With Cadence’s track record, we were certain that we could finally reach out to the libraries and give these books – and their authors – the attention they deserved.So, a campaign was planned to bring these wonderful books to the attention of libraries across North America.  The books for the campaign were printed and shipped to The Cadence Group – everything was ready.  And then, disaster struck.  Due to circumstances beyond anybody’s control, Legacy Books Press ended up underfunded by over $4,000.  There was no choice – for the business to continue operations, the library campaign had to be put on an indefinite hold.But with your help, we can raise the money to help bring these amazing books onto library shelves, where they can be enjoyed by thousands upon thousands of readers across North America.  Help us bring history books to libraries now!

What We Need & What You Get
Legacy Books Press needs your help to bring its wonderful books to public libraries across North America.  To do this we need to raise $7,500, which will go cover the costs of the library campaign.If you can help us raise this money by November 28th, Legacy Books Press will be able to start the library campaign by December 1, 2012.  New Shelves Distribution will market Legacy Books Press’ history collection to public library systems, with these history books expected to start arriving on the shelves of a library near you within two months of the campaign beginning.And, if we raise enough money before the deadline, the library campaign will start as soon as enough money has been raised.  So, the sooner we reach our goals, the sooner these wonderful books will be on library shelves for the public to enjoy.For your generosity and support, we have several perks available – with no geographic limitations on any of them.  It doesn’t matter if you’re in Antarctica – if you donate and earn a perk, we will find a way to get it to you.For a $25 contribution, you will receive a DRM-free e-book in MOBI format of your choice from the following titles:

The Secret History of Star Wars, by Michael Kaminski

The War that Changed the World, by John-Allen Price

As these perks may involve printing books and international shipping, please allow 4-6 weeks for delivery.  If you have donated via credit card, please understand that Legacy Books Press will not receive your donation until the end of the campaign (that's just the way Indiegogo works - don't ask us why), and allow 4-8 weeks for delivery after December 1st (just in case your books end up caught up in the holiday rush).

It’s
a stereotype because it’s true: men often have trouble talking about their
failed marriages.
While
they may be reluctant to openly share their pain, especially with other men, I
think they’re more likely to pick up a book about it, where they’ll see their
own struggles reflected and know they’re not alone.
When
I was going through my divorce, I was desperate to find books that would offer
advice and hope, affirm what I was going through, and let me know I’d survive
it. I scoured the shelves, but almost all I found were titles like When He Leaves, Runaway Husbands, and A Woman’s Journey Through Divorce.
To
be fair, I did find a handful of books written by men. Some were helpful, but
few spoke to the emptiness and grief I was struggling with. Instead, the
majority covered topics like how to secure the best attorney, keep your
financial assets, gain custody of your children, and have great sex again.
Those
are all helpful subjects. But Falling Forward is a different kind of book.
It
explores the emotional landscape of a man’s divorce, from the marriage’s collapse to the author’s eventual healing. It’s a story about
the questions all divorcees will recognize:
How
do you start a whole new life from the ruins of all you’ve known for so long?
How do you handle the shame of those who judge you for your marriage’s failure?
Will you ever feel normal again?
What
crutches work to pull you through the hard times and what don’t? Will you
survive the bottomless grief of losing the most important relationship in your
life? How do you handle dating again after years of marriage?
Falling Forward will be
a collage of brief essays that recount a vivid journey of heartbreak,
disillusionment, and ultimately hope.
But
this book is not just for men. Pain is no respecter of gender. Fortunately,
neither is healing. So just as men can benefit from divorce books written by
and for women (like I did), I believe Falling Forward will also resonate with female readers, providing solace for
their struggles as well as unique insight into what men experience.
It’s
a labor of love, and I hope you can be part of the journey in bringing it to

I could tell that he was white knuckling his way through the heartfelt, yet somewhat generic expressions of support. When I approached the grieving widower, I found myself speaking to him in a very honest and intimate way (with his permission, of course). At the end, he gave me a huge hug (he's not a hugger) and thanked me. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>At Burning Man last year, I found myself in the Temple, helping stranger after stranger through their own grief.

Right now, I am working several part time jobs, 7 days a week. A successful campaign will give me the opportunity to take one day off a week to focus solely on the completion of the book by September, 2013.

<h4></h4><h1>Short Summary</h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hi, I'm Simon Travers and I come from Plymouth UK. I am a trained Pentecostal minister, but last year I took a year out to set up my own publishing brand called Stackhouse Jones and write a book called Anatomy.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I've started this campaign to help me publish Anatomy. It's a book of poems and essays that take the themes and imagery from the Song of Solomon and place them in the 21st Century. I want to present a Christian vision of marriage that goes beyond merely repeating traditional western family values. Anatomy introduces you to a husband and wife, and invites you to draw as close as you dare while they make love with each other, whisper to each other, and build a common identity which changes them both.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Publishing Anatomy would be a personal achievement for me, the culmination of a year of hard work. It probably won't break the bestsellers list, but I know that for some who find it, Anatomy will be a powerful voice of hope and grace.</span></p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">To publish Anatomy, I need £600. That may not seem like a lot of money, but it will make all the difference to my book getting to market quickly and effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My first priority is to purchase a block of 10 ISBN numbers. This costs £126. This will allow me to create 3 editions of the book (print, EPUB, Kindle) and give me the opportunity of a head start on my next 2 projects.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My second priority is to produce a short run of 200 printed copies of the book. I expect this to cost just under £300.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The rest of the money I raise will be used to invest into publicity and promotional materials, such as videos for my website and printed materials such as advertising postcards.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In return for contributing to the project, I will be offering a range of perks related to the release of the book, with the opportunity to guarantee free copies of future Stackhouse Jones projects.</span></p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is the first time that I have ever published a book, so I cannot point to a long track record. All I can tell you is that I have been fully committed to this project. It has been my full time job for the last year without pay. I am ensuring high standards by getting the book proof-read by an experienced proof-reader.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am aiming to produce an abridged audio version of the poems, and I have made a stop frame animated lyric video of one of my poems 'love and pi'. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, so why not go and check it out at <a href=""http://www.stackhousejones.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stackhousejones.com</a> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Anatomy is not a vanity project. I've studied English Literature at university and bought poetry alive to teenagers as a teacher. I have researched a wide variety of authors for this project; poets, philosophers, sociologists and monks all have influenced me.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Anatomy won't be for everyone. It's a surprising read that wants to get under your skin.

<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">People ask me why write a family history? My answer is because I think it is important and because I love it! My passion for family history began when I was a very young boy sitting on my grandfathers knee. My grandfather was 21 years older than my grandmother, and he used to tell me stories about when he was young. I found it fascinating, and interesting and hard to understand: he was the eldest son of a farmer who emigrated from Prussia, Germany.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">By the time he was seven, my grandfather was working on the farm from the crack of dawn and then walking four miles to school and back home again at the end of the school day. When he got home, he would complete more work on the farm until after dark. He used to say school was a time to sleep in between the real work- he was an intelligent man but didn't have the opportunity for much of an education. </span></p>

Goal of Project
1. Preserve the history and culture of our family and therefore the state of Queensland, Australia where they settled
2. Document the stories of our ancestors
What If  I am not part of the family is this relevant to me?
SIMPLE ANSWER YES FOR FOLLOWING REASONS:
1. Preserve our culture and history is everyone's responsibility- it is not just the family that loses its history but the state as a whole
2. You will feel good knowing you are doing the right thing
3. Everyone who donates $2.00 or more goes into the draw to win $400.00. 
4. For a limited time- until the perks on that donation run out- for every $20.00 you donate you get an extra entry in the prize draw. However, the sites accept donations as low as $1.00. 
Is my donation Secure?
The contribute button will link you through to PayPal where you can enter your credit card details securely, which means we never see them and can never access them. You will also know you are doing the right thing by preserving our history – not just that of the family but of our state and country.

I am focused on experiencing and sharing the sacred and imagination~~ Returning to the garden...

I recently created my astrological counseling practice, Weeping Willow Astrology, and moved to the woods after living in Brooklyn as an art curator for 9 years. I have always lived modestly, usually just enough funds to get by and take classes, but now I am here living in a small community in central Massachusetts which is mostly off the grid. I came here to learn from and live in harmony with nature and to focus on my astrology business-- and now I can see the constellations at night! I am seeing my new lifestyle change as a form of activism, to live in a way that is sustainable. 


The Impact


Astrology
counseling is a great tool for understand the self, relating and connecting to the great cosmic cycles of the universe. I look at every chart as a beautiful mandala which gives confirmation and information for growth and healing. My astrology work has been a fantastic channel for my high sensitivity, motivation and creativity. More about the cathartic symbol of the Willow, vision & testimonials. *This fundraiser will help me be able to offer free readings to the community.



What We Need & What You Get
This is a pre-sale for my astrological services to help me gain a foundation and market. It will allow me to focus my connection to nature and to develop my practice, combing with art and healing modalities like Reiki. The funds will go to pay my basic bills, take more astrology classes, and stay on this natural path. I am living very modestly among eco-experts/creatives/healers, and enjoying it profusely.

Each installment will include an illustrated comic book and while I've made a name for myself with my artwork, I generally use less than ideal materials. If I can exceed my goal, I plan on acquiring a better computer with the right additional hardware and software so I can forgo the coloring pencils and make this look like something you really ought to be buying off the shelf of your favorite comic shop.The more I raise, the better the finished product will be!ABOUT THE WRITERGreg Christie is an international man of mystery who writes about his many crazy mis-adventures within the film world for www.Twitchfilm.com.
He’s a disgruntled  film critic, popular for his Boozie Movie drunken reviews and notorious for his Fear and Loathing homages that have now been collected and re-branded as the novel, Pissing in the Punch Bowl.
A native resident of the 9th circle of hell, otherwise known as 
Philadelphia, Greg has worked on film productions in New York, acted as 
an assistant press secretary in Harrisburg, and worked with major media 
festivals in Austin. He won’t say which because he’s not sure if he’s on
 good terms with them. But if you found this page, chances are, you’re a
 fan of them.
He’s also a pulpy erotic artist who sometimes goes by the name of Greg Sukebe.
 After a life destroying stint in Japan, he’s became infected with a 
chronic condition known as Big Fat Nerdom Japanophilia. The only way to 
relieve his symptoms is by making really dirty doodles and has since 
developed a following for his juvenile illustrations of women wrestling 
with dinosaurs and his even stranger black light erotic art.
He’s also an event organizer and promoter. He founded The Hell Fire Film Club and co-founded the Philadelphia Japan Arts Matsurii.",6.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</div><p><b>The Story</b></p>
<p>Someone has been going around killing a lot of people, but
that’s not important right now.</p>
<p>…….</p>
<p>Sylvia Stiletto lives a simple life.  Her job is as easy as sex.  She only has one friend that she needs to
keep track of, so what does it matter if that friend is a kleptomaniac?  No one else even knows she exists, and she
would like to keep it that way.  <i>Love would only complicate things</i>.</p>
<p>Harry Bland may be washed up, but he is still on the biggest
case of his life.  If only he could find
the time to concentrate on it.  He is
more than happy to simply wait out his remaining years in his recliner watching
the evening news.  <i>Love would only complicate things</i>.</p>
<p>Both of their lives are about to get complicated.</p>
<p>Expensive Champagne will be imbibed and pie will be
eaten.  There will be prostitution,
robbery, sadistic games, and fun times at the fair.  And if all goes as it should, two redneck
truckers just might discover the meaning of life.</p>
<p>…….</p>
<p>Also, at some point, someone should really stop this guy
from killing more people.  If there’s
time.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who am I, and why am I bothering you?</b></p>
<p>The hard part is over. 
</p>
<p>The book is written.  </p>
<p>Now I have hit a wall that everyone needs to deal with at
some point, and that is lack of cash.  My
name is Casey Bartsch, and I really want you to read my book.</p>
<p>The last two and a half years of my life have been devoted
to this novel.  I wrote it, edited it,
and wrote it again….repeat.  Now is the
time to finally send it out into the world, but I want to do it right.  I want to eventually make my living doing
this.  I have no designs on riches, just
bill money that comes from doing something I love.  After carefully analyzing the current market,
I’ve decided that the traditional publication route just isn’t as shiny and
wonderful as it seemed to be when I first caught the writing bug 15 years
go.  Self-publishing has become a viable,
and in many ways; preferable alternative. </p>
<p>However, work still needs to be done to get the novel ready
for the spotlight.  Editing, copywriting,
formatting – all of these things cost.  </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>I have had the book edited as well as it can be
without the use of a professional, but that simply isn’t good enough.  I need to hire the expertise of an
editor.  Someone who can help me to make
the book as good as it can be.  This will
run me approximately two grand, depending on how many passes need to be made.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Then, the manuscript needs to be formatted.  Both for physical copies and the myriad of
digital file types.  The cover needs to
be professionally designed so that it doesn’t look like clip art printed in
someone’s basement.  From there, we have
copywriting, ISBN numbers to assign, a web site to create, etc.  These are the things that a self-publishing
company can achieve for me if I hand over a stack of money.  Between 2 and 3 thousand portraits of George
Washington in fact.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The last step in the process is marketing.  There are a million things that I can do to
get the word out about my book, and hopefully I will be able to accomplish two
or three of them.  Should I make enough
to accomplish the previous two goals, every remaining cent will go here.</p>

We want to see sonnets sharing space with experimental prose; we want art that pushes boundaries and bends rules with eloquence.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>LUMINA, established in 2000, is the annual print publication of the Sarah Lawrence College graduate writing program. The journal is run entirely by graduate student volunteers who are committed to giving proper consideration to each unsolicited entry and publishing new artists and writers alongside their established counterparts.</strong></p><strong>
<p>Every year, Lumina is greeted by a new editorial staff; as a result we are not tied to any style or subject matter. Instead, we seek the new, exciting and rule-breaking work from writers both established and emerging.</p>
<p>This year Lumina is excited to be working with The Sarahs, which celebrates the best audio fiction currently being made around the world.</p></strong><p></p><p><strong>LUX uses technology to re-imagine the relationship between written and spoken word, visual art, and the traditionally bound journal.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>LUX combines print media with the expanding world of
technology. The concept is interactive. Essentially when you open LUX, you will
find poems, short stories, photographs, and drawings, as you might in any
journal—but then using the app LAYAR on any smart device, you can scan the
image or words on the page and it will link you to an online piece—whether it
be an audio recording of the author reading the piece, a youtube video, a short
film, a song, or a podcast; the list goes on! </p>

<p>LUX Volume III will continue to push the boundaries that
don’t exist. To do so, we need your help… We are hoping to raise $3,000.00. With these
funds we will be able to publish MORE and reach a wider audience. The money
will go towards production, as well as material costs, printing, and design. Last
year, through our campaign, we were able to improve the quality of LUX by
including more color, and expanding the visual arts technology and spread of
artistic content. This year, with your donation, we will be able to keep LUX
colorful, and far-reaching in space—both physical and cyber. With more
resources available, we can advance our vision of LUX as a cutting-edge journal
that combines mediums and gives artists the ability to translate roles and expand
upon their own creations. With your support, we hope to increase our number of annual
submissions, as well as compensate both new and established artists for their
contribution to the journal. We appreciate any support to help us go even
further. </p>

<p><br/></p></div>","LUMINA’s mission is to provide a journal where emerging and established writers and visual artists come together in exploration of the new and appreciation of the traditional. We want to see sonnets sharing space with experimental prose; we want art that pushes boundaries and bends rules with eloquence.LUMINA, established in 2000, is the annual print publication of the Sarah Lawrence College graduate writing program. The journal is run entirely by graduate student volunteers who are committed to giving proper consideration to each unsolicited entry and publishing new artists and writers alongside their established counterparts.
Every year, Lumina is greeted by a new editorial staff; as a result we are not tied to any style or subject matter. Instead, we seek the new, exciting and rule-breaking work from writers both established and emerging.
This year Lumina is excited to be working with The Sarahs, which celebrates the best audio fiction currently being made around the world.LUX uses technology to re-imagine the relationship between written and spoken word, visual art, and the traditionally bound journal.
LUX combines print media with the expanding world of
technology. The concept is interactive. Essentially when you open LUX, you will
find poems, short stories, photographs, and drawings, as you might in any
journal—but then using the app LAYAR on any smart device, you can scan the
image or words on the page and it will link you to an online piece—whether it
be an audio recording of the author reading the piece, a youtube video, a short
film, a song, or a podcast; the list goes on!

<p>Money for six months of investigations and spreading of the findings. We will in this period then focus on agribusiness with stories on pesticides, MRSA and climate change.</p>
<p><b>Why:</b></p>
<p>We failed in getting a big fund. We need money now for the next half year to continue to produce and publish investigative stories on our website. We count on other funding thereafter.</p>
<p><b>Our goal:</b></p>
<p>We will work cross-border on investigations. Sometimes another center will coordinate, sometimes we will do coordination.</p>
<p>We will gather information using traditionel methods and from new sources as data and social media.</p>
<p>We will publish our stories for free on the web and for mobile platforms.</p>

<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What happens if you don’t get the 5.000 Euro:</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We will try to figure out another way to continue. We don’t have the answer yet.</p>
<p><b>What happens if you get more:</b></p>
<p>We will then speed up the process. And we will do more investigations. We are especially working on projects to coordinate investigations in climate change and environment with good journalists in centres in other countries. We also prepare projects in health and on whistleblowers.</p>
<p><b><b>Why a center for investigative reporting: </b></b></p>
<p>It is very hard, if not impossible, for individual journalists to do revealing stories. Typically, you are up against massive departments of communications staff and political and economic pressure, so you need an organization to back you up, to give you the power nobody has on their own. </p>
<p><b>Why a Danish Centre for Investigative Reporting:</b></p>
<p>Every country needs a centre. Some countries need more than one, for instance US. Investigative journalism is declining in the old media. We really need a network of centres round the world to do more cross-border investigative journalism and documentation on important stories – and to develop new methods and ways to spread the information. Some media do some, but the need is huge – and growing.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ir-d.dk/investigative-journalism-under-pressure/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">See also this background description of our view on the situation in Europe</a>.</p>
<p><b>What stories will you investigate:</b></p>
<p>We focus very much on environment and climate change. Here there is a special need for cross-border investigations. It’s part of a blind spot for traditional media. We will also investigate other important areas such as health, organised crime, corruption, sport - often in cooperation with other centres or traditional media.</p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">How can I follow the funding campaign and what happens:</b><br/></p>
<p>Fill out the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFFVa2xGVG1JRmRqVFVLX2UxZDhqNlE6MA#gid=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">form </a>as a support member. Hopefully you also then contribute, but you can also just sign up as a support member and then get a newsletter. Through our newsletter we will share the status of the campaign. You can also just go to this <a href=""http://www.ir-d.dk/?p=6713"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> on the campaign. We’ll always have the all the latest there.</p>
<p><b>How do you cover stories:</b></p>
<p>The purpose is not to build a fully working news service in investigative journalism or on the specific topics, that we investigate. We publish when we have something to contribute. And then we link to stories from our collaborators.</p>
<p><b>Can we help in other than financial ways:</b></p>
<p>Yes, sign up as a support-member, and get a newsletter, help spread the word on our need for donations, spread our stories, come with tips and story ideas. We also especially need help from a web designer.</p>
<p><b>How do I get involved:</b></p>
<p>We aren’t hiring right now. We don’t have money for that. The investigations that we are doing are also quite limited at the moment. But if you think you can help us out, please send an email.</p>
<p><b>Have another question:</b></p>
<p>Just email us, and we'll try to answer. We might also share the question and answer here later.</p>

A lot of other well-respected investigative reporters are involved in the center. We all have many connections outside Denmark. See more about the center here.

What:
Money for six months of investigations and spreading of the findings. We will in this period then focus on agribusiness with stories on pesticides, MRSA and climate change.
Why:
We failed in getting a big fund. We need money now for the next half year to continue to produce and publish investigative stories on our website. We count on other funding thereafter.
Our goal:
We will work cross-border on investigations. Sometimes another center will coordinate, sometimes we will do coordination.
We will gather information using traditionel methods and from new sources as data and social media.
We will publish our stories for free on the web and for mobile platforms.
Our first story: ""GMO lose Europe – victory for environmental organisations""



Former minister of Agriculture, Eva Kjer Hansen, predicts in 2009 a great future for GMO corn in Denmark. Four years later the trials went wrong, data are kept secret and Monsanto has decided to withdraw GMO development and sales in most of Europe.
What happens if you don’t get the 5.000 Euro:

We will try to figure out another way to continue. We don’t have the answer yet.
What happens if you get more:
We will then speed up the process. And we will do more investigations. We are especially working on projects to coordinate investigations in climate change and environment with good journalists in centres in other countries. We also prepare projects in health and on whistleblowers.
Why a center for investigative reporting: 
It is very hard, if not impossible, for individual journalists to do revealing stories. Typically, you are up against massive departments of communications staff and political and economic pressure, so you need an organization to back you up, to give you the power nobody has on their own. 
Why a Danish Centre for Investigative Reporting:
Every country needs a centre. Some countries need more than one, for instance US. Investigative journalism is declining in the old media. We really need a network of centres round the world to do more cross-border investigative journalism and documentation on important stories – and to develop new methods and ways to spread the information. Some media do some, but the need is huge – and growing.
See also this background description of our view on the situation in Europe.
What stories will you investigate:
We focus very much on environment and climate change. Here there is a special need for cross-border investigations. It’s part of a blind spot for traditional media. We will also investigate other important areas such as health, organised crime, corruption, sport - often in cooperation with other centres or traditional media.
How can I follow the funding campaign and what happens:
Fill out the form as a support member. Hopefully you also then contribute, but you can also just sign up as a support member and then get a newsletter. Through our newsletter we will share the status of the campaign. You can also just go to this website on the campaign. We’ll always have the all the latest there.
How do you cover stories:
The purpose is not to build a fully working news service in investigative journalism or on the specific topics, that we investigate. We publish when we have something to contribute. And then we link to stories from our collaborators.
Can we help in other than financial ways:
Yes, sign up as a support-member, and get a newsletter, help spread the word on our need for donations, spread our stories, come with tips and story ideas. We also especially need help from a web designer.
How do I get involved:
We aren’t hiring right now. We don’t have money for that. The investigations that we are doing are also quite limited at the moment. But if you think you can help us out, please send an email.
Have another question:
Just email us, and we'll try to answer. We might also share the question and answer here later.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Book Project</h3>
<p>We are launching an illustrated children's book to help parents and educators talk to kids about child sexual abuse prevention. What started as a simple rhyming story for kids has evolved to important conversations with parents and educators around ‘stranger danger’ and speaking up when one feels uncomfortable and threatened.</p>
<p>If you’re the type of person who believes in the importance of child abuse prevention but feels overwhelmed by the gravity and sensitivity of the topic, we hope that you’ll consider supporting our project!</p>

<p>In this memorable children’s tale, we learn of three friends – Monkey, Toucan, and Frog – who want to play in the jungle in peace. But there’s one thing in their way: the ominous Mr. Snake, who makes them feel uncomfortable as they go about their day. This story imparts a valuable lesson that young readers can take forward into their daily lives: if something feels off, it’s important to address the issue before it escalates.</p>

We are launching an illustrated children's book to help parents and educators talk to kids about child sexual abuse prevention. What started as a simple rhyming story for kids has evolved to important conversations with parents and educators around ‘stranger danger’ and speaking up when one feels uncomfortable and threatened.
If you’re the type of person who believes in the importance of child abuse prevention but feels overwhelmed by the gravity and sensitivity of the topic, we hope that you’ll consider supporting our project!
 

 

In this memorable children’s tale, we learn of three friends – Monkey, Toucan, and Frog – who want to play in the jungle in peace. But there’s one thing in their way: the ominous Mr. Snake, who makes them feel uncomfortable as they go about their day. This story imparts a valuable lesson that young readers can take forward into their daily lives: if something feels off, it’s important to address the issue before it escalates.

Why we do our work
We were alarmed by the staggering statistics on child sexual abuse and we want to do our part to help prevent victimization.
The Crimes Against Children Research Center reports...

3 out of 4 adolescents who have been sexually assaulted were victimized by someone they knew well.
1 in 5 girls and 1 in 20 boys is a victim of child sexual abuse.

 


 
Here are three reasons we think you might want to support our project:

You’ll be helping create a beautiful picture book and inspiring educational resource for kids age 3 through 8.
Beyond what’s needed to produce and ship our book to you, a portion of your contributions will go towards supporting non-profits addressing child sexual abuse.
You’ll get your very own copy of the book to share with family and friends!

 

 

 


 

 
Why would we launch an IndieGoGo campaign during a global pandemic?
We created Creepy Mr. Snake – A Jungle’s Tale to teach kids about awareness and setting boundaries and this message is as relevant now (in the midst of a pandemic) as it was and will be in the future.
 
How will our IndieGoGo funds be used?
Raising $10,000 will allow us to print and ship 1,000 books.  A print run of 1,000 books is technically small by publishing standards, but it’s the mark where the cost starts to go down significantly.
At $10,000 raised, our cost breakdown will be as follows:

And that's all there is to it.

The book explores the ways in which AI tools are improving healthcare, as well as some of the legal and ethical challenges that lie ahead in this growing frontier. The concepts of AI and machine learning are explained, including examples of how different types of AI are applied to different healthcare problems. This book is an invitation to anyone interested in AI technology in the healthcare system. Readers will learn about the fundamental concepts of AI and machine learning and how these tools are being used to solve real problems in the healthcare system right now!<br/><br/>My name is Matthew Marcetich, and I am the author of How Healthcare Happens: Using AI and Machine Learning to Transform Healthcare. I wrote this book because I am interested in the ways AI is improving healthcare while also recognizing the ethical and legal challenges to applying AI to patient data.

In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion, excitement, and fascination that I have for AI and healthcare. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand how some of the everyday healthcare you receive is influenced and impacted by AI tools.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about AI applications to clinical medicine, research, and administration, and steps needed to develop healthcare AI tools. More specifically, the book describes:</p><ul>
<li>Uses of AI in pharmaceutical development</li>
<li>Ways in which the definition of health data is changing</li>
<li>Administrative uses of AI are not so boring after all and provide significant opportunities</li>
<li>Inspiring career paths of entrepreneurs in the field</li>

Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it. Some ideas: call/test an old college friend, or using the book as an excuse to talk to that doctor/scientist/hacker next door/classmate/neighbor/cousin who might be interested!
Thank you so much of all of your love and support!Thanks again,Matt",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
