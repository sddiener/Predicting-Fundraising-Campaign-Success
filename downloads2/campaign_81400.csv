<p>Hi there!!  We are The Cabaret Project – a production house and entertainment company located in Chicago. We’ve been incorporated since 2007 and have been stimulating audiences since then all over the city, suburbs and have recently expanded into Wisconsin, Michigan, Missouri and even Puerto Vallarta, MX. We are running this campaign to raise capital to open our own piano bar and cabaret here in Chicago, to continue producing these amazing shows and to support all the amazing entertainment professionals here in the city who are looking for somewhere to share their talents.</p>
<p>Let’s break it down in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $50,000 to put towards opening our piano bar and cabaret.</li>
<li>This money will help with securing the lease, decorating the space, buying cabaret tables, chairs, lighting, building and stocking the beautiful bar, designing a lounge area and getting this space ready for shows.</li>
<li>We’ll have 3 different donation packages, giving you the option to choose what is best for you. With your gracious donation of $1,000 you will get an invite to our Private Grand Opening Night Party, full year access to pre-sale and advanced sale ticketing, complimentary VIP upgrades (when available) and a custom tote bag. With a donation of $500 you will get full year access to pre-sale and advanced sale ticketing, complimentary VIP upgrades (when available) and a custom tote bag. And a donation of $100 helps us so much, and you'll get a custom tote bag. Every dollar helps, so any amount is great appreciated.</li>
<li>Without your contribution it will surely stall the opening of our cabaret. We are hoping for your support to help us realize our goal and bring this amazing opportunity to Chicago.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people can't contribute and we understand that - but it doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>We would be so grateful if you could ask people you know to get the word out and share our campaign with them.</li>
<li>Please share this with your friends!</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Scoop</h3>
<p>My name is Kylie Fox. I'm a songwriter in Canada's East Coast. I am crowdfunding to support the recording and release of my debut, full length album. The compelling, introspective nature of my poetry, as well as my emphasis on Canadiana throughout my music, is reminiscent of Joni Mitchell and Alanis Morissette. The eleven tracks are thematically diverse, unpacking topics like teaching, climate change and motherhood, and confronting reality with humour and sincerity. </p>
<p>I've been writing songs my entire life, but it wasn't until I was exposed to a group of peers keen on pushing each other to share and write music at Mount Allison University that I started writing every day. I began playing at the open mics held around the small town of Sackville when I wasn't practicing classical singing, (what I had originally enrolled in school to pursue). Soon enough, I dropped out of school to record a small compilation of songs called ""BalconyEP"".</p>
<p>Eventually, I returned to Mount Allison and graduated with a degree in Drama Studies and Music. There, I found an incredible band- we would rehearse in the music conservatory and tour during the weekends and Spring break. Since graduating, I've embarked on three tours that have allowed me to share my music all over the country. I am constantly improving as a musician and a writer and it is time to take the collection of songs I have worked hard to craft, and create quality recorded work representative of the artist I have become. </p>
<p>When I am not touring or writing music, I am supply teaching or bartending at Moosehead Breweries.  I come from the small, sweet city of Saint John, New Brunswick, the type where you will recognize a familiar face every time you visit Tim Hortons.</p>

I’ve released 12 albums as an independent which gave me the creative freedom to pursue whatever direction I felt. </p><p>Earlier this year I started writing new music inspired by the many Marvel and DC movies released. My entire life I’ve always had an affinity for Superhero’s and Music. So, the past few years I’ve been toying with the idea of combining the two together not just for my amusement but to also inspire the younger generation of Creatives. The Creatives can include musicians, dancers, painters, or anyone with an imagination using this to express ones self.  The name of this album will be announced at a later date, but the Project will be released Summer of 2020. </p><p>You may be asking yourself, why do I (an established artist) need to hold an Indiegogo fundraising campaign to make this album? Well, here are the three major benefits as I see it:</p><ol>
<li>The money raised here will go directly towards the making of this album and comic concept and video animation. Since I’m an indie, this is all out of pocket. It’s just me. What is raised will be poured directly back into the making and marketing of this project.</li>
<li>The more we raise, the more money I’ll have to ‘get it out to the world and inspire the younger generation.’ My costs include (musician fees, mixing fee, mastering costs, studio rental recording fees, publicist, radio promotion, photo shoot, music videos, artwork design, printing, other marketing expenses, etc. which all add up to well over $15,000 and could go up to $25k+ depending on the amount spent on marketing).  </li>
<li>Lastly, at the $25 level and up, I’m going to include an EXCLUSIVE BONUS TRACK that only YOU will get via digital download. This song will NOT be released to the public, ever! </li>
</ol><p> </p><p><strong>My goal is to raise $15,000 here on Indiegogo,</strong> however the net from that after Indiegogo and Credit Card fees plus fulfillment costs will be around $3,000 which will leave a remaining$12,000. Therefore, if we could raise more, that would be amazing! </p><p><strong>This is my 1st Indiegogo campaign</strong></p><p>And if you are unable to contribute at this time, you can still help ‘spread the word’ via your social media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.). Any mention would be sincerely appreciated!</p><p>If we Hit our Goal, I will take the first 300 copies of the Finished Album and Comic Book and give to a deserving Fine Arts Program in the US. I’m very excited about this new project and can’t wait to share it with you.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Let’s Be Creative, </strong></p><p><strong>~Marcus</strong></p><p> </p><p align=""center""><strong>This is where WE can use YOUR help...</strong></p><p align=""center""> </p><p>In order for me to pay for the rest of the ‘Project’ costs (I’ll break it down for you shortly), I really need your financial support to finish it. Our projections show an additional $15,000 is needed to complete everything (my goal here on Indiegogo is $15k which cover the rest of the cost of Studio Recording, Paying session Musicians, Producers, Graphics, Comic book Printing, Animated Video, mixing, mastering. Since I remain an independent artist, I simply don’t have the deep pockets of the major record labels to do projects like this.  Any and every dollar given will greatly be appreciated and used to the completion of this Project.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Here’s the breakdown of where the money raised is going:</strong></p><p>• Mixing of the music.</p><p>• Mastering of the music.</p><p>* Comic Book Pressing and design cost.</p><p>* Video Animation Creation to match the Cartoon.

</ol><p> </p><p> </p></div>","OverviewHi thereI’m Marcus Anderson, a contemporary jazz, R&B, and pop artist that has been recording for 14 year. I’ve released 12 albums as an independent which gave me the creative freedom to pursue whatever direction I felt. Earlier this year I started writing new music inspired by the many Marvel and DC movies released. My entire life I’ve always had an affinity for Superhero’s and Music. So, the past few years I’ve been toying with the idea of combining the two together not just for my amusement but to also inspire the younger generation of Creatives. The Creatives can include musicians, dancers, painters, or anyone with an imagination using this to express ones self.  The name of this album will be announced at a later date, but the Project will be released Summer of 2020. You may be asking yourself, why do I (an established artist) need to hold an Indiegogo fundraising campaign to make this album? Well, here are the three major benefits as I see it:
The money raised here will go directly towards the making of this album and comic concept and video animation. Since I’m an indie, this is all out of pocket. It’s just me. What is raised will be poured directly back into the making and marketing of this project.
The more we raise, the more money I’ll have to ‘get it out to the world and inspire the younger generation.’ My costs include (musician fees, mixing fee, mastering costs, studio rental recording fees, publicist, radio promotion, photo shoot, music videos, artwork design, printing, other marketing expenses, etc. which all add up to well over $15,000 and could go up to $25k+ depending on the amount spent on marketing).  
Lastly, at the $25 level and up, I’m going to include an EXCLUSIVE BONUS TRACK that only YOU will get via digital download. This song will NOT be released to the public, ever! 
 My goal is to raise $15,000 here on Indiegogo, however the net from that after Indiegogo and Credit Card fees plus fulfillment costs will be around $3,000 which will leave a remaining$12,000. Therefore, if we could raise more, that would be amazing! This is my 1st Indiegogo campaignAnd if you are unable to contribute at this time, you can still help ‘spread the word’ via your social media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.). Any mention would be sincerely appreciated!If we Hit our Goal, I will take the first 300 copies of the Finished Album and Comic Book and give to a deserving Fine Arts Program in the US. I’m very excited about this new project and can’t wait to share it with you. Let’s Be Creative, ~Marcus This is where WE can use YOUR help... In order for me to pay for the rest of the ‘Project’ costs (I’ll break it down for you shortly), I really need your financial support to finish it. Our projections show an additional $15,000 is needed to complete everything (my goal here on Indiegogo is $15k which cover the rest of the cost of Studio Recording, Paying session Musicians, Producers, Graphics, Comic book Printing, Animated Video, mixing, mastering. Since I remain an independent artist, I simply don’t have the deep pockets of the major record labels to do projects like this.  Any and every dollar given will greatly be appreciated and used to the completion of this Project. Here’s the breakdown of where the money raised is going:• Mixing of the music.• Mastering of the music.* Comic Book Pressing and design cost.* Video Animation Creation to match the Cartoon. (including the editor and post-production.)• Artwork & Design (for both the Album and Comic Book and CD/Comic packaging).• Manufacturing & Shipping cost.•Marketing Expenses. *Musician studio cost.*Producer cost.• and more...  This is all on top of what has already been done and paid for, including:• Pre- Production for music.* Studio Session Musician recording.* Pre-Artwork and Characters design.* Sample Printing for Comic.* Pre-Video Animation. As you see, this is a lot into completing a finished commercial release. Obviously, there is a lot more to it than just putting out another album. However, I’m up to the task and committed to making it great and inspiring the next generation of CREATIVES!YOU can help contribute to this project via the many ‘Perks’ available to choose from. Starting at just $25 all the way up to $8,000 :)And if you can't contribute monetarily, you can still help get the word out. Please tell your friends, family, and co-workers about this campaign and feel free to use the 'share' tools right here on the Indiegogo site.

<p>Cette campagne de socio-financement a pour but la création de mon premier album (EP). Les fonds amassés m'aideront pour les différentes étapes de ce projet, et vos dons me seront d’une aide précieuse pour rendre ce projet réel et pour être en bénédiction pour la francophonie par le message que Dieu a déposé sur mon coeur. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>Je me présente : </strong></u></h3>
<p>Je m’appelle Will Abriel et je suis fou de Dieu, passionné par la louange et passionné par les églises de la francophonie. Depuis ma conversion en 2010, je savais que la louange ferait partie de mon identité. Je me suis converti sur les chants de Luc Dumont et la louange est devenue une empreinte profonde sur mon coeur. Depuis 2011 j’ai composé des dizaines de chants et 9 ans plus tard je m’apprête à enfin partager ce que Dieu a mis sur mon coeur. Voici le chemin par lequel Dieu m ‘a permis de passé jusqu’à ce projet aujourd’hui. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>J’ai commencé à m’impliquer dans le service de louange en 2011 dans une église à  Reims, c’est là que tout a commencé. Je suis devenu leader de Louange en 2012. En 2015 je me suis marié avec ma merveilleuse femme : Déborah ! Nous avons quitté la ville de Reims pour aller à Tours où j’ai pu perfectionner mon ministère auprès de supers leaders (mention spécial à Mickaël Adèle qui a juste renforcé ma passion envers Dieu et le ministère). </p>
<p>En 2017, nous avons quitté la France pour le Québec (Canada), pourquoi ? J’ai entamé une formation biblique sur 3 ans à l’institut de théologie pour la francophonie. J’ai, par la même occasion, rejoint l’église Nouvelle Vie sous la direction de Pasteur Claude Houde, où je sers activement jusqu’à aujourd’hui.</p>
<p>J’ai pu encore une fois acquérir de l’expérience dans le leadership, je fais parti de l’équipe des leaders de louange:  j’assiste Mylen Query (Responsable du département Louange) et Sandra Kouame (Pasteur louange Impact jeunesse) dans le développement de ces différents départements liés à la louange.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>Pourquoi Un album EP ?</strong></u></h3>
<p>1- Comme je le disais plus tôt, lors de ma conversion j’ai eu cette conviction qu’un jour je sortirai des projets pour les églises. Je ne savais ni comment et ni pourquoi mais cette promesse était gravée sur mon coeur. Aujourd’hui je comprend pourquoi et je vois la main de Dieu sur mon parcours. Je suis plus que convaincu que c’est le temps de partager ce qui a été semé dans mon coeur. </p>
<p>2- Dans nos Eglises, nous sommes en manque de compositions françaises. Je voudrais par cet album, ajouter ma voix et agrémenter le répertoire de la louange francophone. </p>
<p>3 - Libérer un son, une louange authentique et une louange collective. Sans prétention et avec humilité, je crois que Dieu a déposé des mots et des chants spécifiques qui pourront toucher les âmes et les coeurs de ceux qui aspirent à une louange profonde et sincère. </p>
<p>4- Cet album sera un outil afin de pouvoir visiter les églises, les encourager et former des musiciens et leaders de louange dans les églises qui ont des besoins et qui veulent développer leur ministère d’adoration. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>Mon Projet : </strong></u></h3>
<p>Tout d'abord un ""EP"" est en fait un album, contenant moins de titres. Me concernant, il se nommera « Te Servir », et contiendra 6 titres différents. Ces titres seront congrégationnels et actuels. </p>
<p>Ces chants parleront de plusieurs sujets importants dans l’Église et pour la vie du chrétien (Saint- Esprit, guérison, consécration et adoration) et aideront à connecter plus facilement au coeur de Dieu qui mérite la première place. </p>
<p>Je suis très reconnaissant et vous remercie pour chaque support et pour votre soutien durant cette campagne. </p>
<p><br/>Vos dons serviront surtout :</p>
<p>Au mixage et mastering</p>
<p>Arrangement et Réalisation artistique </p>
<p>Duplication et impression</p>
<p>Et toute la réalisation de mon album</p>
<p>Pour contribuer et m'aider dans ce projet, cliquez simplement sur le bouton ""SOUTENEZ CE PROJET"" (en haut à droite) et indiquez le montant de votre choix.</p>
<p><u><strong>Merci pour tout</strong></u></p>
<p>J'ai vraiment hâte de pouvoir vous faire découvrir cet album, et je prie que ces chants puissent vous bénir et vous permettre de vivre des temps avec Dieu, dans sa présence. <br/>Merci encore pour vos dons et n'hésitez pas à  partager les publications en lien avec ma campagne.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! MilaDawn here! I'm starting this campaign because a lot of you always ask when I'm headed to your city. Well, here's your chance to help me get to you! A lot of you know me as a comedic content creator, but music is my first passion and I want to share it with everyone I can. I have great support from all over the U.S for what I love to do, and I'm ready to branch out to some of the surrounding states to put on an amazing show for you. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Music is a BIG part of Who I Am. It's what I love to do and it's incredibly gratifying to be able to do what you love everyday. That being said it can also be extremely difficult to support yourself on music alone. But that doesn't stop me from pouring my blood, sweat and tears into what I love to do. With your generous contributions and support, I will be able to take my dreams to the road, bringing me one step closer to turning these lifelong dreams into a reality. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHZinGcAmfc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Your contributions will provide me with safe places to sleep, rehearsals, dancers, band, venue costs, airline and or bus fare, security and FOOD! I can't forget that :) This is<strong> hundreds</strong> of hours of work, and I certainly want the entire team to be paid for their time, talents, and dedication. </p>
<p>I plan on bringing a couple other people along that are comedians so it's all types of entertainment. Also, each city will have a different special guest comedian join for the show to be apart of this crazy ride.</p>
<p>That being said, I don't expect you to give something for nothing so I am giving back just the same. In return for helping me I have some great perks that I'm sure you'll enjoy!</p>
<p>I'm hoping and praying that I reach my goal of $25,000 but in the event that the numbers fall short (heaven forbid) all contributions will still go towards the same travel expenses and MORE MUSIC. Every little bit goes a long way and the giving is a two-way street. Consider your gift not as a hand out but as a Hand Up! </p>

<h3><strong><u>Oogee Wawa Back In The Studio For New LP</u></strong></h3>
<p>Oogee Wawa is an Alternative Reggae, HipHop band based out of Long Island, NY. We have been apart of the east coast reggae touring circuit for 6 years playing over 200 shows each year around the country. After parting ways with long time members at the start of 2018 we took that year to rebuild and refine ourselves with new talent, and it is awesome. </p>
<p>We are starting a crowd funding campaign to help raise the necessary funds to complete our biggest studio album yet. We are extremely excited to be working with Mike Watts, owner of Vudu Studios (Glassjaw, The Dillinger Escape Plan, etc). We are really focused on bringing the good vibes of Oogee Wawa to the next level with a dynamic studio album that our fans deserve. The past year was a real struggle and test of our strength but with the outpouring of love and support from our ever-growing fan base we were able to re-build and get back to doing what we love and do best and that is create feel good music with a positive message. </p>
<p>With all the changes in technology and how that has effected the industry it has become difficult to fund studio work without a major backer. We in Oogee Wawa has prided ourselves in doing everything in house with the help of friends and likeminded individuals who have the same common goal of spreading positive, conscience music. The take over of ""stream based"" music services have left us artists with stacks of CD's and empty wallets and no way to fund the next project. This is where your generosity and contributions come into play. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have set a goal of 10K to finish tracking, mixing, producing and mastering our next full length album. We have put together some pretty cool perks for your contribution ranging from Merch packs to Spending the day in the studio with the band. </p>
<p>Any overage will be used for increased marketing in an attempt to reach a wider base of music lovers and aid in the inevitable album release tour. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We can't thank you all enough for the years of support and encouragement. Any contribution is very much appreciated as this will greatly help in moving forward on this dream chasing journey. We understand that times are tough for all and if you can not contribute with currency a simple SHARE on social media would be equally as helpful. </p>

We have set a goal of 10K to finish tracking, mixing, producing and mastering our next full length album. We have put together some pretty cool perks for your contribution ranging from Merch packs to Spending the day in the studio with the band. 
Any overage will be used for increased marketing in an attempt to reach a wider base of music lovers and aid in the inevitable album release tour. 
 
We can't thank you all enough for the years of support and encouragement. Any contribution is very much appreciated as this will greatly help in moving forward on this dream chasing journey. We understand that times are tough for all and if you can not contribute with currency a simple SHARE on social media would be equally as helpful.

<h2><strong>ABOUT BUSK IT</strong></h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Mina Alali. You may know me from my music - I’m a pop singer/songwriter, and music producer. Being an artist, I know the struggle of trying to make money from music, which is why I’m creating a revolutionary app that will digitalize the concept of busking, when a street musician or an artist plays for money. The app is called Busk-It, and it will launch in Fall 2020.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: any artist or musician is able to live-stream to music lovers across the world. It’s just like busking on the street, but now online, accessible anytime and anywhere, whether it’s from home, at a practice session, or even during a public performance.  These are exclusive performances only available on the app.</p>
<p>For music lovers, this is truly live music at your fingertips. You’ll be able to choose your favorite genres of music, and artists performing those genres will show up on your app. If you become a fan of an artist and you like their music, you can support them through donations.  They need your help to be known and thrive.</p>
<p>For every musician who becomes discovered and is able to make a living, there are thousands of equally talented musicians who go unnoticed. By using Busk It, your dollar goes towards these musicians, and their ability to continue doing what they love. You are contributing towards a new and easy way for artists to reach global audiences and generate income. </p>
<p>Busk It is an application, created by an artist and musician, for artists and musicians. </p>
<h2><strong>WHY I NEED YOUR HELP</strong></h2>
<p>But, I need your help. The costs to make this app as smooth, polished, and ready for independent artists as possible, requires a lot of time, commitment, and decent funding. I (Mina) was able to work enough to fund the development of the app for iOS ($11,500), but of course there are many Android users who would benefit from using this app as well. </p>
<p>This is why I’m asking you to help me fund the costs to develop and launch the app for Android users and to cover the legal costs to ensure a successful start for the company, that will in turn that benefit both music lovers and music makers. <strong>If you are able to donate, here are the tiers of incentives!</strong> *Every tier includes the reward below, as well.*</p>
<p>$25: Bumper/Laptop Sticker: “I Was a Mini Angel Investor for Busk It”</p>
<p>$50: Personalized Thank You Note from CEO</p>
<p>$100: Busk It T-Shirt</p>
<p>$300: Lifetime Recognition on Busk It Website as an Angel Investor</p>
<p>$500: Early Access to app before official launch (first dibs on account names, etc!)</p>
<p>$1,000: Invite to Official App Launch Party in Northern CA (Date TBD)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Example: Donate $300 and receive:</p>
<p>1) Lifetime Recognition on Busk It’s Website as Angel Investor</p>
<p>2) Busk It T-Shirt</p>
<p>3) Personalized Thank You Note from CEO, and</p>

<h3>We are raising funds for SONGS OF LOVE &amp; DEATH - to make and promote an album of traditional songs - Reg Meuross with Harbottle &amp; Jonas </h3>
<p><br/>Songs of Love &amp; Death is the new collaborative album from two of this country’s finest and most engaging folk/acoustic acts: Reg Meuross and Harbottle &amp; Jonas</p>
<p>Born from a remote collaboration for Harbottle &amp; Jones’s highly successful (400,000 views and counting!) #savingthegoodstuff video series, Songs of Love &amp; Death has now evolved into a stark yet beautiful album of traditional songs.</p>
<p>Described as “a mighty songwriter” by Martin Carthy, Reg Meuross has been a constant presence in the nation’s folk clubs and venues throughout his thirty-year career. <br/><br/>With thirteen solo albums to his name, songs such as ‘England Green &amp; England Grey’ and ‘And Jesus Wept’ have entered the modern folk canon, but, until now, he has never delved into the traditional songs that have so influenced his writing.<br/><br/>“Over the years I have played with some of the finest folk musicians in Britain. Karen Tweed, Phil Beer, Jackie Oates, Martin Carthy etc yet I had never considered doing an album of traditional songs before, but during lockdown I began to look more closely at the songs of these islands, songs that were ever-present at clubs where I played” Reg explains.<br/><br/>“Songs I knew in my breath and my blood like they were in my DNA. Although these songs inhabited me, I realised I’d never inhabited them and I took the chance to explore, eventually settling on ten songs, and the idea of recording an album started to form in my mind.<br/><br/>When I got the call from Harbottle &amp; Jonas asking if I was interested in a collaboration, my first thought was one of my favourite folk songs, Lord Franklin, which I’d loved since hearing John Renbourn’s version when I was 15 or so and first learning to play guitar. I loved what we did together so much that we decided to continue work on all ten songs.” <br/><br/>Harbottle &amp; Jonas, husband and wife duo David and Freya, are “one of the finest folk duos in the country” according to Folking.com, and have made an impressive mark on the UK’s folk and roots scene in a short period of time.  Their most recent album The Beacon was written and recorded (as a trio album with fiddle player Annie Baylis) at home during the summer of 2020 and heralded as “magnificent” by Folkradio.co.uk. They have made appearances at the legendary Sidmouth Folk Week, were chosen to take part in Global Music Match 2020 by English Folk Expo, and were invited to participate in the 2020 Folk Alliance International Showcase.</p>
<p>Matching Reg’s talent for conveying the true meaning behind a song in his delivery, with David and Freya’s exceptional arrangement and accompaniment skills, Songs of Love &amp; Death tackles some of the most enduring songs from the English tradition, beautifully recorded by Josh Best-Shaw in a 15th Century church that sits on the edge of Dartmoor.</p>
<p>David, Freya, and Reg are so proud of these recordings, and with your help they believe they can release something wonderful and special that will make a mark in the folk landscape that is truly lasting.<br/><br/>The songs:<br/>She Moved Through The Fair<br/>Barbary Allen<br/>Lord Randall<br/>Lord Frankin<br/>Oxford Girl<br/>As I Roved Out<br/>I Wish The Wars Were All Over <br/>Adieu Sweet Lovely Nancy<br/>Anachie Gordon<br/>The Trees They Do Grow High </p>
<p>photos: Rachel Snowdon, cover art Joey Meuross</p>
<p> </p>
<p>HOW YOU CAN HELP<br/><br/>Recording, mixing, and mastering; artwork design; CD manufacturing; promotional campaigns; photoshoots; there are many costs involved in producing an album and we are asking for your help.</p>
<p>We are part way through the recordings and they sound superb. We need your help raising funds to pay for all the expenses.<br/><br/>We will be offering pre-order links in a while but  initially are asking if you would like to:</p>
<p>- Book a trio concert or house concert (which will feature solo and trio sets)</p>
<p>- Buy a trio song commission or an arrangement of a traditional song of your choice (outside the album)</p>
<p>- Make a kind donation and receive a personal thank you card and signed lyric of your choice from Reg, Freya and David</p>
<p>- See your name in the album credits under, ‘thank yous’</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Do you like Classic Rock, Blues, and Soul music? For years now, people of all ages have been saying to me, ""There's no more good music, like back in the day"". Well there is new music that you would like, but it's hard to find. If you got past the first sentence, then I think you'll like the new music that I'm going to record.</p>
<p>Much of the old music that a lot of us like  was recorded in Muscle Shoals Alabama, and we're going back there. We've enlisted some of the original Muscle Shoals musicians to record a new ""Modern Electric Blues"" album, and the sound will be familiar, like an old friend. </p>
<p>***Before I go any further, I'd like to mention that some people want to be a part of helping to create some new good music, but want to tailor their own ""Perk"". Just click the red ""Back it"" button. You can put in any amount and email me at tony@tonysarno.com with what you would like to receive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Legendary keyboard man Clayton Ivey and his awesome rhythm section; bass player and original ""Swamper"" David Hood, and drummer Ed Green will help me create a new classic ""Muscle Shoals"" album. We'll be recording at East Avalon studios with Mark Maynard producing. Mark produced my first blues album ""It's a Blues Thing"", which we recorded in Memphis, and this one will be called ""It's a Blues Thing Too"" (Muscle Shoals Edition).</p>
<p>Thank for letting me create some new music for you, and I know that you'll enjoy it!  Tony </p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>For those not familiar with my music, here are some excerpts of reviews of my last blues album:</p>
<p>""He sings with a searing intensity that recalls the early bluesmasters and plays with a terse urgency that invite comparisons to Albert King and 60's Clapton. ""Crybaby blues"" is an instant classic that makes you wonder just when the hell Stevie Ray Vaughan jammed with Steve Marriott""</p>
<p>-VIC GARBARINI, MUSICIAN MAGAZINE</p>
<p>""If the mainstream is presently in the market for its next straight-blues act (à la Stevie Ray Vaughan, Robert Cray etc.) don't be surprised if it turns out to be a Tony Sarno Thing"". </p>
<p>-RICHARD JOHN CUMMINS- BLUES REVUE MAGAZINE</p>
<p>""One serious barnburner is It's a Blues Thing by Tony Sarno and the Screamin' Blue Demons. Music this good comes in a strong third-just behind bikes and babes- on the list of things that make life worth living"". </p>
<p>-EASYRIDERS MAGAZINE</p>
<p>""Sarno is a flame-throwing guitarist whose chosen weapon of destruction is a Fender Telecaster"". It is with this weapon that he wreaks havoc throughout this disc. He does this without coming off as the next guitar god Stevie Ray Vaughan imitator and displays a firm command of blues guitar.</p>
<p>RIT SHERIDAN- THE BLUES HOUND</p>
<p>""From the first day we played it, listener response has been amazing. Tony Sarno's ""It's a blues thing"" has become a staple at IQ Radio"". </p>
<p>-CHUCK WALLACE- WWIQ, MACON,GA</p>
<p>""The closer, ""Screamin' blues demon (It's a blues thing)"" provides one last opportunity for Sarno to let loose with some of the most emotionally volatile, electrifying fretwork ever committed to tape. The hairs on my neck practically stand on end every time I hear this cut."" It's one CD you must hear, he's the samurai warrior of blues guitar. </p>

Feeling that he wanted to serve our country after the horrendous attack on 9/11/01, Brian joined the Coast Guard, and ended up at the State Department in Washington. He really liked my music, and he had built me a custom guitar back in 1997, which I used as a spare for many years, since my main guitar was a 1968 Fender Telecaster. After my Fender was stolen, I decided to play my Brian Robinson Telecaster exclusively in his honor, as he tragically passed away in 2015. It’s a wonderful instrument built by a really great guy, and I’m proud to be playing it. As an amazing perk, I'm offering brand new guitars built exactly like this mine, to four very generous contributors.  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul><li>Money isn't the only contribution you can offer. It is really important to get the word out and let like-minded blues people know about this campaign. I could really use some blues ambassadors around the world to let their friends and family know about our campaign. You can use the Indiegogo share tools to do this. Thanks!</li></ul>
</div><p> </p></div>","Summary
Do you like Classic Rock, Blues, and Soul music? For years now, people of all ages have been saying to me, ""There's no more good music, like back in the day"". Well there is new music that you would like, but it's hard to find. If you got past the first sentence, then I think you'll like the new music that I'm going to record.
Much of the old music that a lot of us like  was recorded in Muscle Shoals Alabama, and we're going back there. We've enlisted some of the original Muscle Shoals musicians to record a new ""Modern Electric Blues"" album, and the sound will be familiar, like an old friend. 
***Before I go any further, I'd like to mention that some people want to be a part of helping to create some new good music, but want to tailor their own ""Perk"". Just click the red ""Back it"" button. You can put in any amount and email me at tony@tonysarno.com with what you would like to receive.
 
Legendary keyboard man Clayton Ivey and his awesome rhythm section; bass player and original ""Swamper"" David Hood, and drummer Ed Green will help me create a new classic ""Muscle Shoals"" album. We'll be recording at East Avalon studios with Mark Maynard producing. Mark produced my first blues album ""It's a Blues Thing"", which we recorded in Memphis, and this one will be called ""It's a Blues Thing Too"" (Muscle Shoals Edition).
Thank for letting me create some new music for you, and I know that you'll enjoy it!  Tony 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For those not familiar with my music, here are some excerpts of reviews of my last blues album:
""He sings with a searing intensity that recalls the early bluesmasters and plays with a terse urgency that invite comparisons to Albert King and 60's Clapton. ""Crybaby blues"" is an instant classic that makes you wonder just when the hell Stevie Ray Vaughan jammed with Steve Marriott""
-VIC GARBARINI, MUSICIAN MAGAZINE
""If the mainstream is presently in the market for its next straight-blues act (à la Stevie Ray Vaughan, Robert Cray etc.) don't be surprised if it turns out to be a Tony Sarno Thing"". 
-RICHARD JOHN CUMMINS- BLUES REVUE MAGAZINE
""One serious barnburner is It's a Blues Thing by Tony Sarno and the Screamin' Blue Demons. Music this good comes in a strong third-just behind bikes and babes- on the list of things that make life worth living"". 
-EASYRIDERS MAGAZINE
""Sarno is a flame-throwing guitarist whose chosen weapon of destruction is a Fender Telecaster"". It is with this weapon that he wreaks havoc throughout this disc. He does this without coming off as the next guitar god Stevie Ray Vaughan imitator and displays a firm command of blues guitar.
RIT SHERIDAN- THE BLUES HOUND
""From the first day we played it, listener response has been amazing. Tony Sarno's ""It's a blues thing"" has become a staple at IQ Radio"". 
-CHUCK WALLACE- WWIQ, MACON,GA
""The closer, ""Screamin' blues demon (It's a blues thing)"" provides one last opportunity for Sarno to let loose with some of the most emotionally volatile, electrifying fretwork ever committed to tape. The hairs on my neck practically stand on end every time I hear this cut."" It's one CD you must hear, he's the samurai warrior of blues guitar. 
-BOB CIANCI- THE RIVER REPORTER

Some excerpts from my older recordings:


 
 You may have seen the Netflix documentary ""Muscle  Shoals"". The Rolling Stones' ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Wild Horses"", The Staple Singers' ""I'll Take You There"" and ""Respect Yourself"", Wilson Pickett's ""Mustang Sally"", and ""Funky Broadway"", Percy Sledge's ""When a Man Loves a Woman"", Bob Seger's ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" and ""Main Street"", Boz  Scaggs' ""Dinah Flo"", Clarence Carter's ""Patches"" and so many other great records were cut there with the great session musicians, engineers, and studios in the area. They achieved  a ""sound"" and a definite ""vibe"" that translated to many hit records. There were great Blues records cut there too, by artists like Otis Rush, Little Milton, and Bobby ""Blue"" Bland.

<h3>The Promise ~ an Ebenezer Special Project</h3>
<p><i>A heart to worship and a desire to pray into the return of HIS people to the Land of Israel -Aliyah is something important to us all. </i></p>
<p>Recently a group of young adults have come together with this same heart and desire. <br/>Out of this they have felt to produce a compilation album of worship songs which has a focus on what God is doing through the fulfilment of His word, specifically relating to the Aliyah of the Jewish people in these days.</p>
<p>We want to make this project readily available to the Ebenezer network Internationally and also the wider public, creating worship which can be combined with intercession and prayer, taken into prayer groups and used to bring an atmosphere of worship and honour to God in all the nations.</p>
<p><strong>Back to where it all began....</strong></p>
<p>In 2018, there was an Ebenezer conference in Jerusalem Israel, the theme was ""A Time to Favour Zion"". During the conference, some of the worship team spontaneously gathered and recorded (somewhat unintentionally) a song called Time to Favour Zion, which had been written as a prayer/worship song for the conference that year. </p>
<p>Some months later, this song was put with instrumental backing, and released. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and people wrote in commenting on its impact, saying how it brought focus as they were in a prayer meeting wanting to focus on Aliyah. (You can view it here <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2fXuUo5a7g"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2fXuUo5a7g</a>) </p>
<p>It was out of this place that we felt the calling to create more along these lines. </p>

<h3>The Financial side</h3>
<p>Each song on the album <i>""The Promise""</i> has been donated by the artist to the CD. Songs have been written by young adults, Ebenezer prayer partners and supporters around the world. The album cover and design are also donated.</p>
<p>We hope to record the album by the end of 2020 (if travel is permitted), and all personal travel costs and accommodation will be covered by the individual artist. It was important to the team behind this project that it is publicly known that there is no financial gain on a personal level to any member. ALL PROCEEDS/PROFIT made from the CD will go directly to supporting the ministry of Ebenezer Operation Exodus. </p>
<p><u>So why are we fundraising? </u></p>
<p>Initial upfront costs for this kind of project are significant, and not all things can be donated. The cost of hiring a recording studio, mixing and mastering the songs for both CD and digital release, as well as printing the CDs. The team has specifically not asked for any funds from those already donated to the ministry of Ebenezer.</p>

Aloha Every Sunday Afternoon</strong></p><div>
</div><p>Na Ohana Hoaloha, a Hawaiian Music band based on Molokai,
Hawaii, has always had one basic goal: spread the aloha.  Playing a live performance every Sunday
afternoon, Na Ohana Hoaloha has entertained thousands of local residents and
visitors since its inception in 2004. 
The music, hula, and audience involvement offered by the band make its
weekly performance a “must attend” event for many.</p><div>

kupuna (elder) of the Molokai community. 
She set a high bar for band members of respecting Hawaiian tradition and
keeping a positive, constructive attitude with a constant focus on sharing the
spirit of aloha in ways that engaged as well as entertained the audience.

respected kupuna in her own right, Na Ohana Hoaloha carries on those important
precepts.  </div><div>
<strong>The band is not paid for
its performances.</strong>  </div><div>Tips are used to
keep the band operating with any balance used to support local charitable
concerns.  The band frequently
volunteers at fundraising events on Molokai and makes other contributions.

Hoaloha.  This has manifested in an
upwelling of creativity from band members, expressing themselves in original
music and hula choreography.  In 2013, band member DJ Pelekai shared his wisdom about the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcW0SFr8rJw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">traditions of hula </a>in a video by PF Bentley.  In
2010, the Band released a DVD, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AaHagip72Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Pretty Old for Our First Time”, </a>as a

</div><h3>Pahu Hope Ko Makou - ""Our Goal""</h3><div>
<strong>
</strong>
</div><p><strong>Spreading Aloha on a World Stage</strong></p><div>
</div><p>Presently the band is producing a CD, “Kai Moku - The
Changing Tide”, for release during the Na Ohana Hoaloha 2015 European
tour, where the band will share Hawaiian culture, music, and hula on a world stage.  The tour, beginning in England and continuing throughout Continental Europe, will reach
thousands of people from around the world.  The anchor events will occur in Geneva, Switzerland:</p><ul>
<li>On July 7, the band will perform to an audience of over 1,000 diplomatic represenatives of over 170 missions to the United Nations in Geneva</li>
<li>On July 8, the band will perform for several hundred representatives of island nations in a cultural exchange</li>
</ul><p>Scheduled events will reach an audience from around the world.  The combination of the band's performances and the gift of ""<em>Kai Moku""</em> to the international community will engage and embrace audiences to leave a lasting message of aloha.</p><div>
</div><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>It will be Hawaiian Music for the
world.</strong></span></p><div>
</div><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span>Arriving in London and staying in Bristol, the band plans to
tour small venues in England. 
These will include pubs and other informal places of gathering, where
“Hawaiian Night” will draw local residents to listen and participate in the
sharing of the band’s aloha.  </p><div>
</div><p>The band plans to travel through Paris to Geneva,
Switzerland.  There, scheduled
events centered around the extensive international community will bring
Hawaiian music and cultural practices to the world stage.  Na Ohana Hoaloha is  partnering with Ka ’Imi Switzerland, a Swiss Hula
Halau, organized independently but under the international roof of Ka ’Imi
Naauao O Hawaii Nei Institute. With dancers from Switzerland, Germany
and Austria  – all students of Maui-based Kumu Hula Roselle Keli’ihonipua Bailey– it
will be a truly international celebration of Hawaiian culture.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1334986/files/20150328210505-IMG_4846.JPG?1427601905"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Ka 'Imi Switzerland Hula Halau performs with chant and ancient forms of dance <div>
</div><p>After the anchor event, the band plans to remain on the
continent to perform additional events. 
These events will again offer local residents a glimpse of Hawaiian
culture.  Additionally the
relationship between the band and the local halau will demonstrate that the
spirit of aloha can stay alive and well in the context of inland, continental
communities.</p><div>
Arcing from the spark of
these events, the spirit of aloha offered by Na Ohana Hoaloha may spread to
countries around the world.  It
will reach diverse audiences and influential leaders in the global
community.  It will bring Hawaiian
culture, music, and hula to the world.</div><div> </div><p>All contributions graciously donated to our Indiegogo campaign will be used for the following:</p><div> </div><ul> <li>Record and produce the ""Kai Moku"" CD </li>
<li>Share the CD as a gift of Aloha to the world diplomatic community </li> <li>Travel expenses associated with getting our band to the world stage</li> </ul><div> </div> <div> <h3>Watch the Tide Rise on ""Kai Moku""</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Join us on the adventure of recording and producing Kai Moku
– The Changing Tide as we put together our ideas for sharing aloha on a world
stage.  See how an old fashioned Hawaiian
band brings its music to life with a combination of ancient instruments and
modern recording technology.</p>

Aloha Every Sunday Afternoon
Na Ohana Hoaloha, a Hawaiian Music band based on Molokai,
Hawaii, has always had one basic goal: spread the aloha.  Playing a live performance every Sunday
afternoon, Na Ohana Hoaloha has entertained thousands of local residents and
visitors since its inception in 2004. 
The music, hula, and audience involvement offered by the band make its
weekly performance a “must attend” event for many.

The founder of the band was Ku’ulei Perez, a respected
kupuna (elder) of the Molokai community. 
She set a high bar for band members of respecting Hawaiian tradition and
keeping a positive, constructive attitude with a constant focus on sharing the
spirit of aloha in ways that engaged as well as entertained the audience.

Led today by Julia Hoe, one of the founding members and a
respected kupuna in her own right, Na Ohana Hoaloha carries on those important
precepts.  
The band is not paid for
its performances.  Tips are used to
keep the band operating with any balance used to support local charitable
concerns.  The band frequently
volunteers at fundraising events on Molokai and makes other contributions.

Quality of performance is important to Na Ohana
Hoaloha.  This has manifested in an
upwelling of creativity from band members, expressing themselves in original
music and hula choreography.  In 2013, band member DJ Pelekai shared his wisdom about the traditions of hula in a video by PF Bentley.  In
2010, the Band released a DVD, “Pretty Old for Our First Time”, as a
fundraising project for Akaula School, an important contributor to education on
Molokai. 

Each Sunday, Na Ohana Hoaloha continues to welcome all who come to hear and participate.  The tradition of sharing Hawaiian aloha perpetuates.

Pahu Hope Ko Makou - ""Our Goal""


Spreading Aloha on a World Stage
Presently the band is producing a CD, “Kai Moku - The
Changing Tide”, for release during the Na Ohana Hoaloha 2015 European
tour, where the band will share Hawaiian culture, music, and hula on a world stage.  The tour, beginning in England and continuing throughout Continental Europe, will reach
thousands of people from around the world.  The anchor events will occur in Geneva, Switzerland:
On July 7, the band will perform to an audience of over 1,000 diplomatic represenatives of over 170 missions to the United Nations in Geneva
On July 8, the band will perform for several hundred representatives of island nations in a cultural exchange
Scheduled events will reach an audience from around the world.  The combination of the band's performances and the gift of ""Kai Moku"" to the international community will engage and embrace audiences to leave a lasting message of aloha.
It will be Hawaiian Music for the
world.
Arriving in London and staying in Bristol, the band plans to
tour small venues in England. 
These will include pubs and other informal places of gathering, where
“Hawaiian Night” will draw local residents to listen and participate in the
sharing of the band’s aloha.  
The band plans to travel through Paris to Geneva,
Switzerland.  There, scheduled
events centered around the extensive international community will bring
Hawaiian music and cultural practices to the world stage.  Na Ohana Hoaloha is  partnering with Ka ’Imi Switzerland, a Swiss Hula
Halau, organized independently but under the international roof of Ka ’Imi
Naauao O Hawaii Nei Institute. With dancers from Switzerland, Germany
and Austria  – all students of Maui-based Kumu Hula Roselle Keli’ihonipua Bailey– it
will be a truly international celebration of Hawaiian culture.Ka 'Imi Switzerland Hula Halau performs with chant and ancient forms of dance 
After the anchor event, the band plans to remain on the
continent to perform additional events. 
These events will again offer local residents a glimpse of Hawaiian
culture.  Additionally the
relationship between the band and the local halau will demonstrate that the
spirit of aloha can stay alive and well in the context of inland, continental
communities.
Arcing from the spark of
these events, the spirit of aloha offered by Na Ohana Hoaloha may spread to
countries around the world.  It
will reach diverse audiences and influential leaders in the global
community.  It will bring Hawaiian
culture, music, and hula to the world. All contributions graciously donated to our Indiegogo campaign will be used for the following:  Record and produce the ""Kai Moku"" CD 
Share the CD as a gift of Aloha to the world diplomatic community  Travel expenses associated with getting our band to the world stage    Watch the Tide Rise on ""Kai Moku""


Join us on the adventure of recording and producing Kai Moku
– The Changing Tide as we put together our ideas for sharing aloha on a world
stage.  See how an old fashioned Hawaiian
band brings its music to life with a combination of ancient instruments and
modern recording technology.
Here’s the play list, and you can listen to drafts as they
progress…

These songs are not all traditional Native music, but a blend of cultures that includes all ""tribes"" of humanity. An expression of the present and the past as well as of the timeless beauty of nature. It's about the peacemaker that is inside all of us, and the people who choose that peace. What Peacemaker will emote is a deep love for humanity, including respect for women, and a sacred appreciation for creation.<br/><br/>I have worked with a lot of other people over the years, and now I am inspired to produce my own work of art. The goal of this project is to produce an EP Album with 5 songs, hopefully setting the foundation for a Full Album release with 10 songs in the future.<br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">

These songs are not all traditional Native music, but a blend of cultures that includes all ""tribes"" of humanity. An expression of the present and the past as well as of the timeless beauty of nature. It's about the peacemaker that is inside all of us, and the people who choose that peace. What Peacemaker will emote is a deep love for humanity, including respect for women, and a sacred appreciation for creation.I have worked with a lot of other people over the years, and now I am inspired to produce my own work of art. The goal of this project is to produce an EP Album with 5 songs, hopefully setting the foundation for a Full Album release with 10 songs in the future.

<h4>Hi everyone and welcome to my indigogo campaign.</h4>
<h4>
<br/>This album came from my deepest vulnerable place. I had been told I had Six months to live due to liver cancer. I had to find the courage to believe something else was possible. At first I thought I was going to die .The upset for me was not in the dying but in the leaving my children behind and my beautiful granddaughter who was two at the time. I couldn't bear the thought of it. Something in me rose up and fought for my life. The songs started to emerge as I was clinging on through the chemo through the pain and through the fear of the unknown. They gave me hope and a place to rest and tune in to the healing inside me. They also gave me the courage to be with past pain and release it. I began to see that all this was happening for a purpose and my soul was waking up to another level. I know now my <span style="""">purpose is to share my experience and these songs so that people know that </span><span style="""">no matter what medical road we take we can find peace, love for the self and healing.</span>
</h4>
<h4>
<span style="""">Anyone who has ever been given similar news please take a look  at is ""The Penny Brohn Cancer Care Centre in Bristol UK"" It was a life line for me. The approach there is to look at the body, mind and spirit and I was so hungry for care and nurturing. No one until this point had asked me if I knew why I had cancer. That question set me on a path that was to radically transform my health. You can go there on a living well course for the weekend and it is all free. Unfortunately one of their main funders have been lost and some of their courses have been cut, so a </span><span style="""">percentage of sales from the album will go to helping keep this healing place accessible to people.</span><span style=""""> Lots of the songs were written in this wonderful place including a song For Pat Pilkington after she passed away. She was one of the founders and one of the most amazingly inspiring people I have ever met. We had the privilege to play her song at her book launch of ""The Golden Thread"" there was lots of tears and lots of smiles and lots of angels.</span>
</h4>
<h4>
<span style="""">So here I was with an albums worth of songs and didn't have a clue about the next move . I was beginning to have a bit of energy return so I decided to go to Brighton to do a course in </span><span style="""">EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique). Which was also a huge part of me healing.</span>
</h4>
<h4>
<span style="""">I asked my friends Steve Lovell and his family if I could stay with them. What I didn't know was that Steve had been a music producer and had worked with Blur, Holly Johnson and Julian Cope, among others. His wife Rachel was a member of Dolly Mixture. Although they are no longer in the main stream music business they still record from home. They asked me if I would like to sing on a couple of tracks. I shared my story, they listened to the songs and Steve said ""I want to produce them""! Rachel has sung backing vocals and I am so grateful for all the input from both of them. I truly feel I am being guided by angels to make this happen. It has taken us 8 months to </span><span style="""">recorded the songs. The</span><span style=""""> next step is to get them out in to the world. That is where we need your help.</span>

<br/>Our goal is for the campaign to raise £5000.<br/>Any capital raised beyond this will go towards media distribution and touring the UK.</h4>

It has been three years now since I was diagnosed with the tumour.I take each day at a time 

In pledging any amount or purchasing a perk, you will make a profound difference to people whether they are ill, well, or living with cancer. It will give them access to something that helps and instructs them how to tune in and relax to the healing within them.Everyone benefits from relaxing and tuning in to health.

Our goal is for the campaign to raise £5000.Any capital raised beyond this will go towards media distribution and touring the UK.

I want to say the biggest thank you to everyone that has been a part of my journey. You have given me hope and joy in my darkest times and I am sure that all your love has helped me to stay alive.

<h3>Breve reseña</h3> <p>Hola amigos,</p>
<p>Somos un grupo de miembros de la Iglesia Presbiteriana y Reformada de Tepeyec, ubicada en San José, Costa Rica. Nos hemos dado la tarea de proveer a la comunidad cristiana en Latinoamérica, una producción musical profesional que incluya canciones e himnos cristianos clásicos 100% apegados a principios bíblicos.</p>
<p>¿Y esto por qué? Se preguntarán.  Nos hemos dado cuenta de que la mayoría de las producciones musicales cristianas en español, se enfocan en coros modernos con buen ritmo; sin embargo, las canciones e himnos clásicos con mensajes apegados a la Biblia, se han ido perdiendo lamentablemente a través de los años.</p>
<p>Queremos retomar dichos cánticos con este proyecto, y hacérselo llegar a todos los hermanos en Latinoamérica que sientan esta necesidad.</p>
<p>Los músicos son:</p>

Somos un grupo de miembros de la Iglesia Presbiteriana y Reformada de Tepeyec, ubicada en San José, Costa Rica. Nos hemos dado la tarea de proveer a la comunidad cristiana en Latinoamérica, una producción musical profesional que incluya canciones e himnos cristianos clásicos 100% apegados a principios bíblicos.
¿Y esto por qué? Se preguntarán.  Nos hemos dado cuenta de que la mayoría de las producciones musicales cristianas en español, se enfocan en coros modernos con buen ritmo; sin embargo, las canciones e himnos clásicos con mensajes apegados a la Biblia, se han ido perdiendo lamentablemente a través de los años.
Queremos retomar dichos cánticos con este proyecto, y hacérselo llegar a todos los hermanos en Latinoamérica que sientan esta necesidad.
Los músicos son:
Allan Gómez - Guitarra y voz
Choi Kim - Piano
Gabriel Moreira - Voz
Sergio Martínez - Bajo
Alejandra Sáenz - Saxofón alto


Lista de canciones a agregar al CD



1- Dios descendió2- Brilla en mí3- Yo Te doy las gracias4- Estamos reunidos5- Escudriñemos6- Cerca más cerca7- Que mi vida entera esté8- En Jesucristo Fuente de paz9- Grande es Tu Fidelidad10- Santo Santo Santo11- Aquel que es Poderoso - Judas 1: 24-25 (Doxología)12- Creced en Gracia y Conocimiento - 2 Pedro 3: 18 (Doxología)

We plan to finish the recording process in late January and the mixing and mastering process by early February. Unfortunately, this won't come cheap and that's where we need your help. We have a completed a budget projecting a grand total of $1,000 to complete this album, which isn't exactly pocket change.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>It started in the late summer of 2012. Peeling Grey was performing as a trio for a couple shows in Texas. On the way back to California, unknown to us at the time, the seeds were planted for ""Our Sky's Falling"". </h3>
<p>Roadside memorials seen along the way inspired the first song (""Flowers for the Dead) for ""OSF"". But, it wasn't a smooth transition to get to where we are now. Putting together this campaign and finishing our second full length album has been no easy task.  Some personal hardships and line up changes would occur before all the pieces were set in place to really move forward. <br/></p>
<p>Brad Hartman (drums) and Dave Skott (bass) answered the call for a much needed reinvention of Peeling Grey in 2013. Now, we were truly ready to get the band back on track and write a new album. Since then we released a self-financed video and single (""Rumors""), played across California, Nevada, reached Chicago and even Germany last year. </p>
<p><b>So, why a full length album and not just another EP or single?</b> The answer is very simple; We have an elaborate story to tell and we ask for your help to make that come true. From the drive back from Texas, the degrees of loss we experienced, death, transition, to matters coming full circle with a sense of hope again, the full length route is still relevant. It's the best way of presenting the current batch of songs in a manner that will do them justice. It's a concept album, so to speak. Above all, it is to be enjoyed by our fans, friends, and anyone that can relate. Your contribution will mean the world, and we vow to make it worth every dollar.</p>
<p><b>Here's a breakdown of the cost in making this album. If you choose to hop on board, you should know how you're helping us. </b><br/></p>
<p>$2500 - Vinyl (due in the fall of 2015)</p>
<p>$1600 - Production / Engineering Costs <br/></p>
<p>$1200 - CDs (Release date June 25th)</p>
<p>$1000 - Studio time (Surplus Studios)<br/></p>
<p>$800 - Mastering both for CD and Vinyl<br/></p>
<p>$500 - Promotions (internet &amp; print)  </p>
<p>Total= $7600 </p>
<p><b>As you can see, the cost of vinyl is on top of the list. This will be our first release on that format, and from what we understand many of you have either asked for a PG vinyl pressing or been enthusiastic about the prospect. </b>The vinyl version will offer alternate artwork and a slightly different track listing. <br/></p>
<p>We want to give you what you want. With enough of cash, we can certainly deliver. Due to a backlog / high demand the LP version would be ready in the fall.

</div></div>","It started in the late summer of 2012. Peeling Grey was performing as a trio for a couple shows in Texas. On the way back to California, unknown to us at the time, the seeds were planted for ""Our Sky's Falling"". 
Roadside memorials seen along the way inspired the first song (""Flowers for the Dead) for ""OSF"". But, it wasn't a smooth transition to get to where we are now. Putting together this campaign and finishing our second full length album has been no easy task.  Some personal hardships and line up changes would occur before all the pieces were set in place to really move forward. 
Brad Hartman (drums) and Dave Skott (bass) answered the call for a much needed reinvention of Peeling Grey in 2013. Now, we were truly ready to get the band back on track and write a new album. Since then we released a self-financed video and single (""Rumors""), played across California, Nevada, reached Chicago and even Germany last year. 
So, why a full length album and not just another EP or single? The answer is very simple; We have an elaborate story to tell and we ask for your help to make that come true. From the drive back from Texas, the degrees of loss we experienced, death, transition, to matters coming full circle with a sense of hope again, the full length route is still relevant. It's the best way of presenting the current batch of songs in a manner that will do them justice. It's a concept album, so to speak. Above all, it is to be enjoyed by our fans, friends, and anyone that can relate. Your contribution will mean the world, and we vow to make it worth every dollar.
Here's a breakdown of the cost in making this album. If you choose to hop on board, you should know how you're helping us. 
$2500 - Vinyl (due in the fall of 2015)
$1600 - Production / Engineering Costs 
$1200 - CDs (Release date June 25th)
$1000 - Studio time (Surplus Studios)
$800 - Mastering both for CD and Vinyl
$500 - Promotions (internet & print)  
Total= $7600 
As you can see, the cost of vinyl is on top of the list. This will be our first release on that format, and from what we understand many of you have either asked for a PG vinyl pressing or been enthusiastic about the prospect. The vinyl version will offer alternate artwork and a slightly different track listing. 
We want to give you what you want. With enough of cash, we can certainly deliver. Due to a backlog / high demand the LP version would be ready in the fall. The CD and digital formats are scheduled to be officially released on June 25th, accompanied by a local record release party. We'll play the entire album in track order and in its entirety that night.

Soon it will be pressed and ready for your listening pleasure.  I never dreamed that I'd do an album and I'm so excited!</p><br/><p>     I see (and contribute) to more and more crowdfunding requests as the months go on.  I have been a big supporter of independent music in clubs, halls and folk festivals for years.  I buy a lot of CDs at these shows and many more from websites, and lately from these campaigns.  I'm offering perks that are a good value for your dollar and stuff that I'd be interested in too!<br/><br/>The money contributed will cover the cost of paying the producer, the musicians, mastering and reproduction of the compact discs and the cover.  Brock Zeman made me feel at home in the studio and guided me through the process of laying down the basic guitar and vocal tracks.  I love the sounds he gets on his albums and when I heard Tom House's album: Winding Down The Road a couple years back, I knew if I ever recorded an album, I'd want Brock at the helm.  He used his band: Dylan Roberts on drums and Blair Hogan on guitar, mandolin &amp; piano.  They did a fantastic job!  It is being mastered by Steve Foley at audiovalley and I have yet to choose where it will be reproduced.<br/></p><br/><p>   I recorded the album at Big Muddy Studios at Brock Zeman's place in the wilds of Lanark County in Eastern Ontario.  Driving out to his place I was reminded of the roads that lead to Big Pink outside Woodstock, New York, where the Band recorded their seminal album Music from Big Pink.  I was lucky enough to get to a few Midnight Rambles down there before Levon passed and I loved the whole feeling and mojo in that area.  The similarities in the terrain and the way Brock, Blair Hogan and Dylan Roberts added to my songs in the studio at Big Muddy led to the name.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">I've spent all my life in Woodstock, Ontario - which is a half hour drive from the hometowns of all The Band members except Levon

</h3> <p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hi, this is SOA, the Toronto-based jazz world trio
featuring jazz piano, African percussions and soulful vocals. </p>
<p>We've been around since the end of 2011, playing mostly
in Québec and Ontario, releasing an EP in 2012 and a first music video in 2013.
<br/></p>
<p>2015 is a milestone for us:  we have recorded part one of our
first upcoming album and we have the opportunity to bring SOA to Europe to play in some exciting venues, to record the second part of the album and to become the subject of a documentary.<br/></p>
<p>Those are huge steps for the band which is why we need your support to be able to make it happen!  <br/>
</p>
<h4><b>REFLECTIONS, the tour</b></h4>
<p>The tour will bring us to Germany and France. For now, we have confirmed dates in Vannes in Britanny, Paris, Heilbronn, Stuttgart, Berlin. We will be joined by amazing French jazz pianist Sylvain Ransy, whom we know from his time in Montreal. <b><br/></b></p>
<h4><b>REFLECTIONS, the recording</b></h4>
<p>Touring is always the best opportunity to get a good creative vibe together as well as to sharpen the sound. This is the reason why we want to use the energy of the tour to<b> </b>record the second part of the album with Sylvain Ransy in Europe. <b><br/></b></p>
<h4><b>REFLECTIONS, the documentary<br/></b></h4>
<p>We were thrilled when film-maker Andreas Krätschmer, our long-time collaborator, proposed to join us on the tour and make us the subject of a short documentary. The film will be screened in Montreal and Toronto in the fall 2015 and we plan to submit it to festivals.</p>
<b></b>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Your support goes to... <br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>We take a giant leap of faith and are setting out to raise enough money here to cover expenses for the trio and our
filmmaker. Here's what your contributions will go to:

</p>

</div></div>","Be a part of SOA's European tour, documentary & recording!
 


Hi, this is SOA, the Toronto-based jazz world trio
featuring jazz piano, African percussions and soulful vocals. 
We've been around since the end of 2011, playing mostly
in Québec and Ontario, releasing an EP in 2012 and a first music video in 2013.

2015 is a milestone for us:  we have recorded part one of our
first upcoming album and we have the opportunity to bring SOA to Europe to play in some exciting venues, to record the second part of the album and to become the subject of a documentary.
Those are huge steps for the band which is why we need your support to be able to make it happen!  

REFLECTIONS, the tour
The tour will bring us to Germany and France. For now, we have confirmed dates in Vannes in Britanny, Paris, Heilbronn, Stuttgart, Berlin. We will be joined by amazing French jazz pianist Sylvain Ransy, whom we know from his time in Montreal. 
REFLECTIONS, the recording
Touring is always the best opportunity to get a good creative vibe together as well as to sharpen the sound. This is the reason why we want to use the energy of the tour to record the second part of the album with Sylvain Ransy in Europe. 
REFLECTIONS, the documentary
We were thrilled when film-maker Andreas Krätschmer, our long-time collaborator, proposed to join us on the tour and make us the subject of a short documentary. The film will be screened in Montreal and Toronto in the fall 2015 and we plan to submit it to festivals.

   Your support goes to... 
 
We take a giant leap of faith and are setting out to raise enough money here to cover expenses for the trio and our
filmmaker. Here's what your contributions will go to:




Travel expenses (international and domestic)

Accommodation: crew gotta sleep!

Food: crew gotta eat!

Equipment and music instruments rental

Recording studio

Even your smallest contribution can make a big difference for us!
 
What you get out of it

First of all, you get a good feeling of helping an independant Canadian jazz band ;-) Then, of course, we have perks: check them out on the campaign page! There is something for everyone. 
  Other Ways You Can Help
Money makes the world go round but sharing and communication make our world brighter! Even if you can’t afford to pledge monetarily, your help is still very
much needed and appreciated. Please talk
about the SOA crowdfunding campaign and share the link to this page everywhere you can. Tell your friends

Here’s your chance to pre-order my new CD and show your support for Indie music!</b></p>
<p>In 2000 and 2010, I independently released records that connected with blues and blues-rock fans around the world, and for this I am very grateful. These records opened some incredible doors in terms of musical recognition, award nominations, critical success and international touring opportunities.</p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>To fund this project I need to raise $15,000. The process of recording and creating a finished album is expensive. The costs include musicians’ fees, recording, mixing, mastering, artwork, pressing and packaging the CDs, travel expenses, distribution, tour dates in support of the album and equipment upgrades for my studio and live performances. </p>
<p>I've put together some awesome perk packages to offer you for your contributions, such as album downloads, signed CDs and vinyls, Paul Black t-shirts, band gear, and a private house concert! Throughout the campaign, I will also be updating contributors on the recording as it unfolds.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>For me, as an independent artist, your contribution will make all the difference. The music industry has changed dramatically and record deals (especially in blues/blues-rock) are hard to come by. Fan support is critical. Together, we can create some incredible music and push the genre forward into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Anything I raise above the goal will be directed toward additional marketing, touring, and overall promotion of the record. This could include shooting a video, and pretty much anywhere else you will see or hear my music besides social media (e.g., via ads, movies, commercials, or even in bookstores). So the more backers, the better! I’ve had a lot of fun putting these perk packages together, and I can’t wait to see who gets involved.</p>
<p>When you give to this campaign, your funds are directly supporting the recording, mixing, mastering, and marketing of the latest Paul Black ALBUM, and all of the talented people who help make it happen! </p>

On the strength of that one album I was invited to play Canadian Music Week 2012 and then invited back again the following year to play Canadian Music Week 2013 and North By North East. Now two years later, and armed with over a dozen new songs I have created that are bound to make your head spin (in a good way), I am gearing up to record my sophomore album!I've got an amazing band, who I had the pleasure of recording my first album with, and they are keen to help me do my  new songs  justice. We want to take this album up a level by doing bass and drum tracks at a bigger, quality studio.And guess what – YOU CAN HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN! Your contributions will help me pay studio costs, production costs, mastering costs,  manufacturing costs and publicity cost so I can release my sophomore album in an organized and professional manner.  With this new album I hope to tour not only Canada, but to far off destination like London, Glasgow and the Netherlands where I have developed relationships with labels, radio hosts and fans.  With this new album I can approach managers and music festival bookers.  You don't have to worry about this album getting dusty in a cardboard box somewhere! I'm going to put this album to work for me, so your money will be well spent!AND GUESS WHAT ELSE? The new record is going to be amazing! One reason why? I'm working again with producer  Mitch ""King Kong"" Girio formerly of the successful sca band King Apparatus.  Don't believe me (about the amazing part)?You can preview the first single from the new album for free here:https://soundcloud.com/melanie-peterson/melanie...

<p>Thank you for taking time to learn about my Indiegogo campaign. For those of you who know me, you know that my music and performing my music is the most important thing in my life (after my husband of course!). I've had so many opportunities over the years that have given me glimpses of hope, but the truth is I've only succeeded in many areas of my career because of people like you consistently supporting me and pushing me to never give up on my dreams.</p>
<p>Opportunities have also come and gone in the blink of an eye. I could've easily given up and felt defeated or burned, but instead it made me work harder. This is one of those times. </p>
<p>Making a radio-ready, high quality EP takes time, monetary resources and a lot of knowledge. I want this album to surpass any work that I've done in the past and I know that my current knowledge of the music industry will allow me to get the EP heard on a grander scale and reach a new demographic of fans. I also want the release of the EP to give other artists I support a chance to flourish. Whether I'm singing or creating a company, I want to be able to help and inspire people. Eventually my goal is to have an indie label. A place where I can help develop and build up careers of other indie artists who I believe in. A place where they can have control of their music and shine the way they are meant to. I can't express how much this project as a whole means to me as it truly is the foundation of a bigger dream.</p>

</div><div> <p>Creating anything from the ground up takes time and a considerable amount of resources. Many don't know what it takes to create a great EP and have it heard, but I've listed below everything it takes to create, market and distribute a top-notch studio EP.</p>
<p><b>-Production/Engineering/Mixing/Editing</b></p>
<p> It is my goal to work with producers who will bring out the best in my original music and help make my EP the best it can possibly be. The producers/engineers need to be compensated for their time spent bringing my music to life and getting it in the best shape possible.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">-Mastering</b><br/></p>
<p>Mastering is a crucial part to any record completion. It gives each track that final umph to make it sound radio ready, pristine, clean and perfect! I will be hiring one of the top mastering engineers in Los Angeles to master the full EP.</p>
<p><b>-Distribution</b></p>
<p>In order to get my music to the right outlets (iTunes, Amazon, Yahoo!, Google, Pandora, etc.), distribution is needed. Getting your music distributed through a qualified distributor is the best outlet. Nowadays most independent artists go through CD Baby or TuneCore to get their music heard but my goal is to get  distribution through a major distributor.</p>
<p>-<b>Public Relations</b></p>
<p>You create the music, you get it on iTunes, it sounds amazing BUT it can't move mountains if no one knows about it! Which is why PR is a huge investment when it comes to getting music heard. For an EP to be released you need at least 6 months of PR to promote and create a buzz. I've worked with smaller PR firms before and done a bulk of the PR myself, but getting the backing of a PR firm with clout costs a good amount of money and they can make a huge difference in how your music is promoted and heard by the world. </p>
<p><b>-Additional Elements</b></p>
<p>Additional funds will be used to create a music video for one of the songs on the album, as well as merchandise to help promote the EP even more. I will also be purchasing a select amount of download cards and physical CD's to sell at my live shows.</p>

Additionally, any success I'm able to procure will only help further the careers of the people I believe in as well.  Being an indie artist is an incredibly difficult and taxing career choice.

<p>The band beginnings is a true love story.</p>
<p>﻿﻿Once upon a summer there was a girl.

She asked her musician friend Silvano to write a song about her heartbreake, and a couple of girlfriends to back her up on stage. A few weeks later the Cernettes were on stage for the first time, for the delight of thousands of happy Physicists, singing Collider , the song that since that day became the National Anthem of the High Energy Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the years to come, the popularity of the Cernettes grew out of the valley of Geneva, to reach other nations and continents, as they performed in events such as International Physics conferences and The World'92 Expo in Seville. Silvano wrote many more songs and many singers and musicians came in and out of the band, each bringing a sligtly different flavour and taste, but the style of the band is solid and unique, and their fame grew larger and larger with every new gig, but they still have one problem: their boyfriends still spend their lives in night shifts.</p>

<p>As the legend has it, one day of 1992, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, at the time a young computer scientist, walked in Silvano's office, with a new version of web server software to be installed onto the central VAX mainframes, which Silvano's team managed. He saw the picture of the CERN girls band on Silvano's mac, and suggested to post it on a new web page about CERN clubs and free time activities, that he was about to publish. The Web at the time counted only a few hundred sites, and a few thousand users, and Silvano was not quite sure how it worked yet, but he handed the gif file to Tim's student, who posted it. </p>

<h3>Short Summary </h3>
<p>       My name is Katie Buxton, I'm an indie folk singer/songwriter living in Nashville, Tennessee, and I'm recording my first full-length album! </p>
<p>       These songs encompass things like questioning religion and why people only listen to what looks good. They're about letting go of what's no longer for you, about not taking life so seriously, and about looking inward for happiness first. They are not just for me - I'm putting these songs out into the world with the hopes that they encourage others to share their own truth and talk about the things that are honest and scary. I think people are really starving for music that's raw and intentional, and with this album I want to change that.</p>
<p>       With your help I can get these songs released and heard and make the release the best that it can be! </p>
<p>*To preview the record and hear two songs that will be on it, check them out here: <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/katiebuxton/sets/katie-buxton"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/katiebuxton/sets/katie-b...</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>        My goal for this campaign - which I have to reach BEFORE March 18th - is $8,000. Recording is already underway, but this will evenly cover album artwork, physical copies, promotion costs, and merch, all of which is super important for a good release!</p>
<p>        As both incentive and a ""thank you"" for donating, I've included perks! Basically the more you give, the more you get in return. For example - if you contribute anything between $15 and $25, you will receive whatever is listed next to $15 on the right of this page. These perks include a copy of the album when finished, merch, a personalized song, and more. :) (*if you want to opt out of these perks and only donate, there is an option at checkout for that as well!)</p>
<p>       Even if I don't reach my entire goal, whatever money I do make will go towards what I can afford with it, whether it's artwork or physical copies - basically whatever I'm most in need of to get the album released!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>       If I don't meet my goal, I won't be able to fund all of the remaining parts of the album and release process and won't be able to promote it properly.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>       Even if you can't contribute, you can still help! Share this link on social media and tell your friends, your family, your neighbor, your dog, and whoever else you can think of :) Basically, help me make some noise about this campaign!</p>

</li>
<li>EVANGELICAL: This project follows the story of someone who comes to Christ and then slips away from the faith. Through Scripture-inspired roots tracks we follow them from their lowest point to being rescued and coming back to the Lord.</li>
<li>UNASHAMED: If you are looking for an album that is full of vague references of the Lord, this is <i>not</i> your project. This album is all about unashamedly proclaiming the name of Jesus Christ and bringing others to Him.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi. I am a composer, sound artist, researcher, improviser, and music educator, currently based in Japan. More about my activities <strong><a href=""http://lxsigman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a></strong></p>
<p>Back in 2013, I collaborated with the Korean artist<a href=""http://blog.eunjunghwang.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong> Eunjung Hwang</strong></a> on a video animation entitled <strong><i><a href=""https://vimeo.com/70344676"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Future Creatures</a>. </i></strong></p>
<p>After attending a screening of <i>Future Creatures</i> in San Diego, the percussionist <strong><a href=""http://www.ericderr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eric Derr</a> </strong>asked me to write a piece based upon the audio and visual material of the animation. What followed was the piece <i>fcremaperc</i>, and several subsequent pieces for a diverse array of instruments and media, which would become the <i>fcremap </i>series. (""fc"" = <i>Future Creatures</i>; ""remap"" = ""re-mapping"" to contrasting performance scenarios.) </p>
<p>Despite stemming from the same source, the compositions comprising <i>fcremap  </i>tend in multiple directions: from the intimacy of inside of the piano to piezo-activated percussion to the voluminousness of ensemble and multi-channel electronics; from carefully crafted score to graphic/animated notation to improvisation. </p>
<p>Over the past two years, I have had the privilege to work with a fantastic international group of esteemed performers in bringing these pieces to life. These artists have included the Belgian pianist <a href=""http://www.frederikcroene.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Frederik Croene</strong></a>; violinst <a href=""http://takao.co.nr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Takao Hyakutome </strong></a>and flautist <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql8U0aKrr24"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Laura Faoro</strong></a>; Tokyo-based Taiwanese clarinetist <strong><a href=""http://pei-luntsai.weebly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pei-Lun Tsai</a>; </strong>and performer-composer-software designer collective<a href=""http://www.decibelnewmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <strong>Decibel New Music Ensemble</strong></a>, based in Perth, Australia. </p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2017: now that the series has reached its completion, <i>fcremap </i> is planned to be released on the innovative and dynamic artist-led label<strong> <a href=""http://www.newfocusrecordings.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Focus Recordings</a> </strong>by the end of the year. Given the dominant role of visual media in cycle of pieces, this release will not only bring together spectacular and sensitive live performances, but also provide access to video downloads.</p>
<p>The listener/viewer will be able to experience all dimensions of the project--from the palpable physicality of the players to the immersive and stimulating visuals. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> The recording and production for the album--usually the most expensive part of the process-- have already been completed. I am asking for your support in covering the costs associated with mastering, disc design, manufacture, and replication, and distribution (physical and digital). </p>
<p>In an effort to share this release with as wide an audience as possible, the recording will appear in the Naxos of America catalog, and be available for purchase across most digital distribution platforms, as well as the New Focus website itself.   </p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not the funding goal of <strong>$3000</strong> is met, the funds raised through this campaign will be directed <i>exclusively </i>towards the expenses outlined above. To guarantee that the recording is successfully released, any funding shortfall will be covered through personal funds. </p>
<p>In return for your generosity, you will be offered a fine variety of perks. At every funding level from $10, you will be acknowledged in the liner notes of the recording, and receive a limited edition <i>fcremap </i>postcard. The album will be available for free digital download ($25) and in signed, physical form ($40). At the $60 level, I will also include a copy of my Nominal/Noumenal portrait recording, released in 2012. </p>
<p>For $100, you get all of the above, plus a 1-hour VIP Skype composition lesson or interview. For top-level contributors ($250 and above), I will <strong>compose a new piece, dedicated to you!!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In 2011, I ran a successful crowdfunding campaign in support of<i> Nominal/Noumenal,</i> my first portrait recording. Thanks to the generosity of the campaign's backers, not only have listeners across the world have been exposed to the pieces on the recording through radio play, digital streaming and downloads, and physical distribution at live events, but the release has also given rise to new projects and collaborations. I hope to achieve similar outcomes with <i>fcremap</i>. </p>
<p> Recording projects such as <i>Nominal/Noumenal </i>and <i>fcremap </i>are crucial not only as documentation, or as a means of bringing together internationally-dispersed members of contemporary arts and music communities, but also in broadening the community of listeners. </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>If you are not in a position to contribute financially to this project, there are other ways in which you can help. Please spread the word about this campaign, and the eventual release. With Indiegogo's share tools, you can reach a broad network of project creators and followers. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I played guitar and sang in old time trio, Triple Chicken Foot for over ten years. We recorded 3 albums all available on CDBaby or Bandcamp (or here as part of a perk!), hosted jams and dances and produced the Los Angeles Old Time Social. The band ended in 2015 when my marriage fell apart and banjo player Mike Heinle moved to Guernville. Born out of this double heartbreak, <i>The Last Kind Word </i>is my first solo record. Originally, I thought it would be a mix of originals and traditionals on the guitar and banjo. But I'm proud to say it's 100% original! There's acoustic guitar and banjo and electric guitar all recorded with Ben Townsend of Questionable Records who engineered and mixed the album. And, something exciting for me is I reconnected with my sound art past and crafted these short Interludes using field recordings of my surroundings, spoken word, electric guitar, synth, a banjo and even my Swedish journalist Uncle Jan's voice, discovered on a film he made in 1975! </p>
<p>I collect records. I love vinyl and since picking up the guitar I've wanted to make a 12"" long-playing, 33 RPM album. When I began thinking about making a solo project, that desire burned bright. I decided to go for it as a way to help pull me out of my blues when my pal Lisa Marr told me about this amazing residency though the Turkey Land Cove Foundation (TLCF) on Martha's Vineyard. ""TLCF provides a quiet space for a woman to progress toward a defined goal, complete a project, and develop tools to propel her life in a new direction."" That was me! My proposal to finalize songs for a solo album was selected. Thinking it would be a mix of originals and traditionals, I went in October for two weeks with some songs and sound works in progress and ideas for covers and came away with 10 original songs on guitar and banjo and 6 sound interludes.</p>
<p>My dear pal Ben Townsend offered to record it and as he is one of my musical heroes, I jumped at the chance to combine the trip east to go to Louisville, Kentucky where he was living at the time and lay down tracks for the songs. He played and sang on it too and on one of my favorite songs I love we dueted on banjo and that put me over the moon. Cheyenne Mize, an amazing musician in Louisville (she has her own solo stuff and plays with Will Oldham), played and sang on it and my travel buddy and Swiper the Dog's mom Ida Mae Specker (fantastic fiddler and singer from Vermont) was around long enough to add harmonies. Back in LA radical accordion and artist pal Erin Schneider laid down accordion on a track. Finally, I took a fun stringband tune down to 1642 Bar and had a buncha buddies come and lay down a ruckusy chorus. All in all, it's a unique reflection of some unique times and travels and the ups and downs of life and love. You gotta hear it!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $5,895.00 This covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>500 Vinyl records with a 4 color sleeve and a double-sided 4 color insert that's like a poster, with a collage on one side and the lyrics on the other.</li>
<li>Recording and Mastering costs</li>
<li>Publishing and digital distribution</li>
<li>Photographer's &amp; Musicians' fees (Everyone's contribution is valued.)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my favorite things about the LP perk is the insert. There's nothing I like more than listening to a record while looking at the artwork and reading lyrics, so I made this mini poster collage on one side and lyrics on the other. You might wanna hang it on your wall!</p>
<p>Another great perk is you can pick up an extra CD like one of Triple Chicken Foot's records or Ben Townsend and Friends album recorded at Deep End (and that I happen to play on.)</p>
<p>Or, if ya like zines and reading and graphics, get one of the remaining copies of my handbound book In the Service of the Song, a rumination on my love affair with old time guitar.</p>
<p>The most unique perks for you high rollers out West who want me nearby is a house concert in your town! Or your very own personalized sound interlude!</p>
<p>And lastly, there's just one of a kind for The Last Kind Word, the original watercolor painting that graces the cover of the album.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal, I will use whatever funds I raise towards vinyl production and the photographer and musician's fees.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I think The Last Kind Word is worth supporting because I think music is worth supporting. If you believe, as I have learned, that the only way through this life is to surround yourself with Love and Truth (most especially your own) and song and laughter and dancing and furry friends, then you must get yourself a copy of this album for your online or vinyl collection.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk and challenge now is getting the vinyl produced and then taking the time to get the songs out there through distribution, live gigs and your support. Putting your own songs into the world is one scary risk, but I feel like with everything I've been through in the last couple of years even just having the record on my own shelf is mighty fine.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Times are tight. If you cannot order a copy now, you could help me get the word out about this campaign for <i>The Last Kind Word. </i> I would be most grateful. (And can reward YOU if you let me know!) Use the Indiegogo sharing tools and social media-it up!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! We are TOMBOi, a queer indie electronic band based out of Jacksonville, Florida. We first came together through mutual friends, cementing a deeper bond through music, community organizing and youth advocacy efforts with local non profits like Girls Rock Jacksonville. Last year, on top of touring and balancing life and our “day jobs” we managed to record and self-produce our first full length album, Spectrum.</p>
<p>Spectrum, is an album that is inspired by the social and personal experiences of growing up as queer androgynous women in the south. We pulled inspiration from our hometown’s on-going battle to pass a fully inclusive Human Rights Ordinance, personal relationships and concepts of identity. When coming up with the name of the album we kept circulating around this idea that everything is on a Spectrum.</p>
<p>As an independent band, we heavily rely on our supporters. Now that we have finished writing, recording &amp; producing Spectrum we need help giving our latest work some legs, arms, pinky toes and prissy paws to get out there to the masses. We are reaching out to our community and future friends to be apart of the final phases of releasing Spectrum into the world. Everything we have ever done has only been possible because of the people we aim to entertain and safer spaces we advocate for. We need all the help we can get! Want to be apart of the Spectrum process? Check out all the extra special exclusive incentives we have put together as our way of saying THANK YOU for your contribution and support &lt;3</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>You may be asking, Where will my money go exactly? Here is a break-down of some of our current costs we need help funding. Every little bit helps &lt;3</p>
<p>• Audio mastering</p>
<p>• CD packaging</p>
<p>• Record Pressing &amp; Distro</p>
<p>• Legal fees</p>
<p>• Radio publicity campaign</p>
<p>• Press campaign and tour publicity</p>
<p>• “Rainbow Warrior” music video</p>
<p>• Merchandise</p>
<p>• Packaging and Shipping</p>
<p>• Tour expenses</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Being three queer women growing up in a less than welcoming and inclusive environment drives everything we do. We aim to create music that shares our story as southern queer women &amp; artists.  Our shows are always put together with the concepts of safe(r) spaces in mind in response to a lack of it where we are from. We hope with your help we can continue to gain momentum towards sharing our music and story in new spaces and in front of new audiences. This is the largest project we have undertaken, but our foundation as a band is almost as strong as our foundation in our friendship. We know with your help we can achieve all the goals we have set for, Spectrum. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
<p>Hi, I am Lysee J and I want to thank you for stopping by my Indiegogo page.  Before I get into my campaign I would like to tell you a little about myself, my background, and my mission as a singer/songwriter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Background</u></strong></p>
<p>I grew up primarily in the bay area and had a challenging childhood as my parents got divorced when I was a baby so I spent my childhood living between two households.  I always loved music and singing, however, I suppressed that part of me until it could no longer be denied.  By the time I was 20, I knew I had to follow my passion and become a singer/songwriter—music called to me and would not accept “no” as an answer. My parents both have advanced degrees (my dad from Harvard and my mom from Stanford) so education is huge in my family and I was nervous about how they would react to my leaving school to pursue music.  Fortunately, my parents both supported me in pursuing my dream so after my second year in college, I dropped out to pursue music full time.  I have had to work hard because I had no musical training and until a few years ago, I had never even had vocal lessons. </p>
<p>I have been fortunate enough to work with several top music producers in Los Angeles and have created three albums, including a mixtape.  All my music has been self-funded and it has taken 8 years of hard work to get to where I am today.  I am at a crucial juncture in my music career as I have an opportunity to significantly increase my fan base and musical opportunities as a result of being featured on a soon to be released song which also features Snoop Dogg (more on this later).</p>
<p><strong><u>My Mission</u></strong></p>
<p>I want to make a difference in the world through my music, especially as it impacts women.  I am very passionate about what it means to truly be a woman in this day and age, a woman who is authentic, honest, real, and connected to her heart.  Imagine if my generation of women grew up with examples in the music industry of women who are not trying to fit into a mold of how they SHOULD look, act, or speak, but women who <strong><i>stand in their truth</i></strong>, who do not let others sway them or make them insecure, and who are unapologetically real. Imagine how the world would evolve into a more loving, peaceful place with positive and powerful feminine leadership. I want to encourage women to love themselves enough to break certain patterns of low self-esteem and unhealthy relationships.</p>
<p>I want to be a positive example for women as to how to be loved, maintain self-love, and be empowered. I want to be a positive example for men as to what to look for and what is truly important in partnership. <strong><i>I want to encourage everyone and teach them how to follow their dreams and create the life they want</i></strong>. Success is a mindset, not a gift randomly bestowed on people who are worthy. <strong>WE are all worthy.</strong></p>
<p>Long term I want to be an activist for female empowerment and also conscious music. I want to spread joy, love, celebration AND create music that connects you to your heart and that expresses the full range of human emotion in a healing way.</p>
<p><strong><u>California Party Song Featuring Snoop Dogg</u></strong></p>
<p>I have been blessed to receive an opportunity to be featured on an artist named C-TRU's song called <strong><i>California Party</i></strong> with <strong>Snoop Dogg</strong>.  I Just found out that the song will be on the soundtrack of the new Tupac movie that was released on June 16<sup>th</sup>.  We just filmed the music video for the <i>California Party</i> song with Snoop Dogg and the music video will be released in a few weeks so this is a huge opportunity for me to leverage the song and the music video in order to grow my fan base. I want to learn from the mistakes of other artists who were not prepared when their big break came along.  <u>This is my big break and I want to be prepared to capitalize off of the momentum and media attention the new song and music video will bring</u>.</p>
<p>The new song and music video will drive new viewers to my website and social media so it is crucial to have my online presence and new music looking polished and on point.  I want to be able to maximize the visual impact when viewers visit my online sites so that I can capture a wider fan base. Justin Timberlake offered me great advice when I met him a few years ago.  He said; “<i>You only get one chance to make a first impression in the music industry</i>.”  <strong><u>This is my one chance and I need your support to make it happen</u></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u>My Campaign--What I Need &amp; What You Get</u></strong></p>
<p>We are releasing the music video in a few weeks and I need funding  for all of the following:  1.  To hire a team to help me build my brand, increase my social media presence, and enhance my website; 2.  For PR so that when the music video is released, I am able to help promote it in order to ensure it reaches the widest possible audience; 3.  To pay for producers, studio time, and mixing and mastering in order to create new music that will undoubtedly reach a wider audience thanks to my being featured in the song/music video with Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p>I am seeking $25,000 because that is the amount I realistically believe will be needed in order to record new music (each song typically costs around $2,500 to produce), promote my music, build my brand, and enhance my social media presence.  I want you to know that I will continue to invest my own hard earned money into my music, however, your contributions will allow me to take my music career to another level and I cannot do it without <strong>You</strong>! As an independent artist, I cannot compete with the resources of a major label, however, with your support, I can still make an impact. Your support is so important to me because I honestly feel that the music industry needs powerful female leadership comprised of REAL women who are authentic and full of vulnerability and integrity as opposed to packaged artists who are products of the standard music industry mold for female artists.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Impact</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>This project is my biggest opportunity to break out in the industry and here’s why:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most artists either release a song through a major label or they have an A list artist on their song so the fans of the A list artist will listen by default, resulting in new exposure to millions of potential fans if you resonate with them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the past few years I have met with agents, record label owners, fans, vocal coaches, and music producers.  They all have said that I am very talented, however, people just need to see me; I simply need exposure in order to break out. Everything is there and I know that as long as I have exposure I will reach my dreams. I am finally on the verge of a breakthrough in my music career. I want to passionately promote the <i>California Party</i> video and I need to create and release new music in order to ride the momentum created by the release of the song and music video in order to elevate my musical profile. This WILL launch me to millions of new potential fans!</strong></p>

</div></div>","Introduction
Hi, I am Lysee J and I want to thank you for stopping by my Indiegogo page.  Before I get into my campaign I would like to tell you a little about myself, my background, and my mission as a singer/songwriter.
 
Background
I grew up primarily in the bay area and had a challenging childhood as my parents got divorced when I was a baby so I spent my childhood living between two households.  I always loved music and singing, however, I suppressed that part of me until it could no longer be denied.  By the time I was 20, I knew I had to follow my passion and become a singer/songwriter—music called to me and would not accept “no” as an answer. My parents both have advanced degrees (my dad from Harvard and my mom from Stanford) so education is huge in my family and I was nervous about how they would react to my leaving school to pursue music.  Fortunately, my parents both supported me in pursuing my dream so after my second year in college, I dropped out to pursue music full time.  I have had to work hard because I had no musical training and until a few years ago, I had never even had vocal lessons. 
I have been fortunate enough to work with several top music producers in Los Angeles and have created three albums, including a mixtape.  All my music has been self-funded and it has taken 8 years of hard work to get to where I am today.  I am at a crucial juncture in my music career as I have an opportunity to significantly increase my fan base and musical opportunities as a result of being featured on a soon to be released song which also features Snoop Dogg (more on this later).
My Mission
I want to make a difference in the world through my music, especially as it impacts women.  I am very passionate about what it means to truly be a woman in this day and age, a woman who is authentic, honest, real, and connected to her heart.  Imagine if my generation of women grew up with examples in the music industry of women who are not trying to fit into a mold of how they SHOULD look, act, or speak, but women who stand in their truth, who do not let others sway them or make them insecure, and who are unapologetically real. Imagine how the world would evolve into a more loving, peaceful place with positive and powerful feminine leadership. I want to encourage women to love themselves enough to break certain patterns of low self-esteem and unhealthy relationships.
I want to be a positive example for women as to how to be loved, maintain self-love, and be empowered. I want to be a positive example for men as to what to look for and what is truly important in partnership. I want to encourage everyone and teach them how to follow their dreams and create the life they want. Success is a mindset, not a gift randomly bestowed on people who are worthy. WE are all worthy.
Long term I want to be an activist for female empowerment and also conscious music. I want to spread joy, love, celebration AND create music that connects you to your heart and that expresses the full range of human emotion in a healing way.
California Party Song Featuring Snoop Dogg
I have been blessed to receive an opportunity to be featured on an artist named C-TRU's song called California Party with Snoop Dogg.  I Just found out that the song will be on the soundtrack of the new Tupac movie that was released on June 16th.  We just filmed the music video for the California Party song with Snoop Dogg and the music video will be released in a few weeks so this is a huge opportunity for me to leverage the song and the music video in order to grow my fan base. I want to learn from the mistakes of other artists who were not prepared when their big break came along.  This is my big break and I want to be prepared to capitalize off of the momentum and media attention the new song and music video will bring.
The new song and music video will drive new viewers to my website and social media so it is crucial to have my online presence and new music looking polished and on point.  I want to be able to maximize the visual impact when viewers visit my online sites so that I can capture a wider fan base. Justin Timberlake offered me great advice when I met him a few years ago.  He said; “You only get one chance to make a first impression in the music industry.”  This is my one chance and I need your support to make it happen.
My Campaign--What I Need & What You Get
We are releasing the music video in a few weeks and I need funding  for all of the following:  1.  To hire a team to help me build my brand, increase my social media presence, and enhance my website; 2.  For PR so that when the music video is released, I am able to help promote it in order to ensure it reaches the widest possible audience; 3.  To pay for producers, studio time, and mixing and mastering in order to create new music that will undoubtedly reach a wider audience thanks to my being featured in the song/music video with Snoop Dogg.
I am seeking $25,000 because that is the amount I realistically believe will be needed in order to record new music (each song typically costs around $2,500 to produce), promote my music, build my brand, and enhance my social media presence.  I want you to know that I will continue to invest my own hard earned money into my music, however, your contributions will allow me to take my music career to another level and I cannot do it without You! As an independent artist, I cannot compete with the resources of a major label, however, with your support, I can still make an impact. Your support is so important to me because I honestly feel that the music industry needs powerful female leadership comprised of REAL women who are authentic and full of vulnerability and integrity as opposed to packaged artists who are products of the standard music industry mold for female artists.
The Impact
This project is my biggest opportunity to break out in the industry and here’s why:
Most artists either release a song through a major label or they have an A list artist on their song so the fans of the A list artist will listen by default, resulting in new exposure to millions of potential fans if you resonate with them.
For the past few years I have met with agents, record label owners, fans, vocal coaches, and music producers.  They all have said that I am very talented, however, people just need to see me; I simply need exposure in order to break out. Everything is there and I know that as long as I have exposure I will reach my dreams. I am finally on the verge of a breakthrough in my music career. I want to passionately promote the California Party video and I need to create and release new music in order to ride the momentum created by the release of the song and music video in order to elevate my musical profile. This WILL launch me to millions of new potential fans!

<p align=""center"">Mr. Chris &amp; the Gassy Bubbles are a children’s rock &amp; roll band based out of Cambridge, Ontario..</p>
<p align=""center"">The band is fronted by Mr. Chris (Chris Torti).</p>
<p>Chris has spent the past 17 years invested in learning about children’s minds.  He has received his ECE diploma from Seneca College, and furthered his studies in that realm, by studying Women’s Studies at McMaster University and by obtaining his ECE Honours Degree at Ryerson University.</p>
<p>Since then, Chris has worked with children in a variety of different capacities. Chris has worked as a literacy specialist, a therapist ( for autistic children), a resource teacher, a librarian, an Early Childhood Educator, a support worker, and a teacher for visually impaired children.  Each of these jobs served as a launching pad for Chris’ creativity.  Chris used his direct experiences with children to nurture his craft and talent.</p>
<p>Chris currently runs programs within his community for children and families to attend.  Chris has teamed with a few local businesses (Farmer’s Market/Library) to help provide interactive programs that are free for families to attend.</p>
<p>Chris is an advocate for learning and is genuinely invested in making children feel happy. </p>
<p>Prior to 2016, The Gassy Bubbles band consisted of childhood friends and hired musicians.  However, in June 2016, Chris was fortunate enough to meet (RECE) Josh Correia (bass), Nathan Farmer (guitar) &amp; Matt Howell (drums), who would go on to become the permanent Gassy Bubbles vibration. (and they're also co-writing the new album with Chris)</p>
<p>Together with the Gassy Bubbles, Chris has intentions of writing many more children’s albums, as well, children’s books and children’s programs for the masses.</p>
<p>The Bubbles brand of children’s music is a bit outside the box.  It’s been created to equally appeal to both children and parents.  If parents enjoy the music, they may feel more inclined to get up and join in some dance with their children.  This is Chris’ method to nurture and foster children’s music.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">20 YEARS OF MUSIC!</h3>
<p>In 1997, we released our first album, ""Birth,"" in conjunction with the birth of our first child, Russell. It was the launch of our music career, our ministry, and our little family. Because of the stunningly warm reception for ""Birth,"" we became connected with so many amazing people. Twenty years, eight albums and four babies later, the same folks who encouraged us at that beginning are cheering us on today. We still have fans come to shows asking for songs from way back in our archives. We feel incredibly fortunate to have been able to make music for this long, and it is all because of our fans, friends, and supporters.

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","20 YEARS OF MUSIC!
In 1997, we released our first album, ""Birth,"" in conjunction with the birth of our first child, Russell. It was the launch of our music career, our ministry, and our little family. Because of the stunningly warm reception for ""Birth,"" we became connected with so many amazing people. Twenty years, eight albums and four babies later, the same folks who encouraged us at that beginning are cheering us on today. We still have fans come to shows asking for songs from way back in our archives. We feel incredibly fortunate to have been able to make music for this long, and it is all because of our fans, friends, and supporters. To every person who has bought a cd (or tape!), sung one of our songs in church, passed around one of our chord charts, showed up to a concert, hosted a house show, downloaded an mp3, told their friends about us and supported us in any way...we want to say thank you.

<h3>The story so far</h3>
<p>Welcome to the highlight of my life! This is the passion, obsession and love that is my music. I'm Anni M Fables from Tasmania, Australia. After my classical music studies I began seeking a way of expressing myself that would allow me to be authentic, engaging and meaningful. I crafted songs for many years before listening to people telling me to record an album. </p>
<p>The 11 tracks for Space (Luck) Sphere were refined, recorded and mixed in Vancouver, BC, Canada during the past 3 years with musicians: Blake McKay, Nathan Turner, Blake McAndless, Justine Apostolopoulos, Jenna Materi, Sabrina Robson, Logan Thackray, Jennifer Charters, Joseph Abbott, Mary Matheson, Shannon Marie, Thalia Apostolopoulos, Emma Law, Brendan Steele, Ryan Trigg, Tynan Rampling, Nadine Pluzak, Stuart McGinley, Wes Coderre &amp; Paul Connell. The process was a wild rollercoaster of learning curves, leaps and loops. The results are greater than I imagined possible and I'm so proud of the ear magic my dear friends and I have conjured up! The first single from the album, Endless, was released in April. You can listen to it <a href=""http://www.annimfables.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Four fantastic pieces of artwork are complete. There are 2 paintings by artist Meli Rose (my sister!) and some magical photography by Mary Matheson. The elements are all ready to see the light! I'm seeking your support to help with the final costs of mixing, mastering, CD replication, distribution and promotion. In gratitude I would love for you to become a part of the package.</p>

<li>Mastering </li>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The bottom line</h3>
<p>I've poured every aspect of my being into this project for the past few years. It has felt like the most valuable thing I've ever chosen to apply myself to. I believe that music can be a gift of inspiration, insight and happiness. I want this to be my gift to my world!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Even though this album was recorded with number of other musicians, it is essentially a solo project. At times it can be difficult to maintain the self-motivation to research my options, devise strategies, make necessary decisions and carry out the actions required to pull together a project like this.</p>
<p>Luckily I'm obsessed. I have discovered more gumption and resolve for this project than I knew I had. The issues that have already been solved along this journey so far give me confidence for overcoming any future obstacles. Most importantly I have an incredible support network with whom I am constantly sharing my ideas, sprouting new ones and gaining perspective. My gratitude to you all.</p>
<p>I see producing 500 CD's as a solid commitment. I know musicians who have boxes of CD's gathering dust in storage. So this is a risk. To meet it I intend to promote my music online to reach my full audience for distribution, as well as continuing to share my music in person wherever I go.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've made music all my life, and this is the first time I've made something of this magnitude to share. Help me get it to you!</p>
<p>I've recorded my first, full length album, ""Many Waters."" Its eleven, original songs are just a few steps away from CD release day! I'm raising funds to mix, master, duplicate, and promote my album, so it will reach more people and better platforms.</p>
<p>I made ""Many Waters"" in true farm to studio fashion. I spent the past nine months driving between Vermont and A Happy Farm in New Hampshire, exchanging farm work for recording time. My friend Amber Martin, a farmer and sound engineer, needed help on her farm and had access to Musician's Mission Recording Studio in Dublin, NH; it was perfect! So, I spent half my time camped out in the field, rebuilding the greenhouse and working the rows, and the other half working on my songs in the studio. The result has me covered in dirt and over the moon! I am so grateful to have found this organic route to my record, in line with the natural sounds and feelings of ""Many Waters.""</p>
<p>Your contributions make it all possible: an album of my original songs, packaged in my original art, ready to take on tour! </p>

<h3>Where Your Money Goes</h3>

<li>Duplication + Shipping - $1,400</li>
<li>Promotion - $1,000</li>
<li>Merchandise- $1,500</li>
<li>Music Videos - $1,500</li>
<li>Post CD Release tour - $1,600</li>
<li><strong>Total - $8,000</strong></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>I've got some pretty sweet incentives for those who donate!</p>
<p>Many contributors will receive an original postcard or sticker, digital download or physical copy of ""Many Waters."" </p>
<p>Larger contributions come with hand painted art, some pretty ridiculous outtakes from my Indiegogo video, or even a personalized song! And a boat load more!</p>
<p>**Make sure to check out the full list of incentives on the right of this page**</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<ul>
<li>I want to share my music. Music is meant to be heard, participated in, and contributed to. This project enters my songs into the larger, musical conversation; it makes it possible for me to continue making music, full time.</li>
<li>I've made demo CD's with my own equipment and recycled calendar pages for packaging. I've recorded EPs in professional recording studios and made them accessible online. But this is the first time I have the whole package: a full length album, in physical form and in cyberspace, complete with my original art!</li>
<li>I am pursuing singing and songwriting full time; a great record opens all the right doors. I can't wait to take ""Many Waters"" on the road and into the online community!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While rewarding, this process had its share obstacles. We had everything from a broken guitar on recording day to a chimney fire on the farm. We did all the recording with just one sound engineer and one musician, working through each obstacle as it arose. Creating all the art by hand, for the album packaging and promotion, has proved quite the endeavor as well! As well as designing, painting, and filming my indiegogo video!</p>
<p>But! It all makes ""Many Waters"" more meaningful. The hard work on the farm put me in the right mindset for the studio. The hard work creating the visual art for this album produces something that is wholly me.</p>
<p>Before this campaign is over, I'll create, and then graphically design, the artwork for the album's packaging. I'll create the artwork for promotional t-shirts, posters, stickers, and online advertising. I'll also host a CD release event. I'll start work on promotional music videos. I'll book and promote the shows for a ""Many Waters"" tour!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't make a donation? You can still help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word: You can make a huge impact just by sharing my campaign video on social media. Every time you share, my album's reach widens exponentially. </li>
<li>Tell your friends! Tell your mom! Get the word out to those who aren't on social media!</li>
<li>Come to a show: It's all about playing music. And I wouldn't have come this far without your amazing support at live performances!</li>

**Make sure to check out the full list of incentives on the right of this page**
The Impact

I want to share my music. Music is meant to be heard, participated in, and contributed to. This project enters my songs into the larger, musical conversation; it makes it possible for me to continue making music, full time.
I've made demo CD's with my own equipment and recycled calendar pages for packaging. I've recorded EPs in professional recording studios and made them accessible online. But this is the first time I have the whole package: a full length album, in physical form and in cyberspace, complete with my original art!
I am pursuing singing and songwriting full time; a great record opens all the right doors. I can't wait to take ""Many Waters"" on the road and into the online community!


Risks & Challenges
While rewarding, this process had its share obstacles. We had everything from a broken guitar on recording day to a chimney fire on the farm. We did all the recording with just one sound engineer and one musician, working through each obstacle as it arose. Creating all the art by hand, for the album packaging and promotion, has proved quite the endeavor as well! As well as designing, painting, and filming my indiegogo video!
But! It all makes ""Many Waters"" more meaningful. The hard work on the farm put me in the right mindset for the studio. The hard work creating the visual art for this album produces something that is wholly me.
Before this campaign is over, I'll create, and then graphically design, the artwork for the album's packaging. I'll create the artwork for promotional t-shirts, posters, stickers, and online advertising. I'll also host a CD release event. I'll start work on promotional music videos. I'll book and promote the shows for a ""Many Waters"" tour!

Other Ways You Can Help
Can't make a donation? You can still help!

Tell your friends! Tell your mom! Get the word out to those who aren't on social media!
Come to a show: It's all about playing music. And I wouldn't have come this far without your amazing support at live performances!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What Is This &amp; Why Am I Here?</h2>
<p>Essentially, we're planning a live concert atmosphere, showcasing new material that we've both been working on and recording it as live albums. Instead of going to normal route of hitting a studio for days with a full band, we decided that we'd first share these songs with you in a different format, and offer a chance to not only be at this show, but help us record this thing WITH YOU.</p>
<p>We're offering a <strong>UNIQUE</strong> event unlike any other in this region. We intend to put on this <strong>EXCLUSIVE</strong> live show with your help and have it recorded, mixed, mastered, and released on CD/digital media!</p>
<p>We see this performance/recording as a way of creating an unforgettable, interactive shared experience with the listener, and we want to be able to do this with <strong>YOU</strong>! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The recording show will be hosted at <a href=""http://www.dguptown.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daily Grind in Martinsville, VA</a>, offering not only food, but 90+ different craft beers, 20+ different wines, and numerous award winning coffee brews</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>Since we decided to go this live performance route instead of shacking up in a studio, we now have to bring the studio to US to get this thing recorded properly. We've already hired an audio professional to come in and help us record. We'll get the songs, simple and broken down, the way that we wrote them, and we'll be able to record the audience at the same time with mics placed strategically throughout the venue. This means YOU GET TO BE A PART OF THESE ALBUMS... if you're there. ;) </p>
<p>We're offering a <strong>SUPER LIMITED NUMBER OF TICKETS (50)</strong> to this special performance, and asking that you help us make funding this thing a little easier by simply pre-ordering the albums that we plan to release from the show. This helps us TREMENDOUSLY, because it puts much less of a burden on us to have to provide funds up front to try to get these songs available to you. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">We've set a flexible goal of $2,000.<br/>This will cover:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Cost of the venue</p></li>
<li><p>Hiring a professional engineer to record, mix, and master the audio</p></li>
<li><p>CD design, artwork, and production, as well as exclusive t-shirts</p></li>
<li><p>Promotion, travel, and project finalization</p></li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We're offering many different pre-order packages to campaign supporters. These include anything from: </h3>

<li>An EXCLUSIVE limited number of TICKETS to the recording show</li>
<li>Digital media (albums in both MP3 and WAV listening formats)</li>
<li>Physical CD copies</li>
<li>EXCLUSIVE t-shirts specific to the live recording show</li>

<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Now, Here's Why We Need Your Help</u></h2>
<p>We're both completely <strong>INDEPENDENT</strong> artists. We don't have the backing of some record label throwing money at us. We don't have managers, or booking agents, or <strong>ANYONE</strong> putting in the leg work for us. We simply put in the time. But, we can't do it all by ourselves, and that's where you come in. </p>
<p>Let's face it, recording quality music is expensive. We've written songs that we're proud of, songs that tell stories about our lives, our experiences, and those around us, and we want to share them with you. There is no extra ""pocket money"" that we're taking home at the end of this. No matter how much we're able to raise, <strong>every penny goes into these projects</strong>.</p>
<p>Every concert ticket we're able to sell, that $15 gets put towards making these albums happen, and that's a super intimate live show that the listener gets to experience. Not only that, but they have the ability to OWN the recording from that night, from the concert that <strong>THEY ATTENDED</strong>, and relive that setting whenever they want.  Every CD pre-ordered adds a little bit more to our budget, and helps us fund this thing a little easier. And as soon as production is finished we'll have your CD in the mail to YOU, right <strong>TO YOUR DOOR STEP</strong>!</p>
<p>We're creating a new kind of relationship with YOU, the listener. We're moving outside of the box, and setting a new precedent in how music can be shared and experienced with others, and we're pretty dang excited about it. </p>

<h3>Who We Are, Where We're Going</h3>
<p>627 Stomp originated several years ago as an idea by Amanda Bernice to instruct people in vernacular dance styles. Taking its name from the Pete Johnson composition and the local musicians' union, its very foundation intended to harness the spirit of Kansas City style jazz. To this effect, it has experienced modest success, including weekly Lindy Hop classes at City in Motion studios, gigs performing choreography at Union Station, and even establishing a three-day dance event known as Kansas City Stomp. Over the years, and through frequent interaction with the local community, it has become apparent that there is much more to the city's jazz heritage than the act of dancing itself. Proud of what our history has given us, and reflecting on the current state of progress in chronicling said history, it became apparent that we too could take an active role in keeping the tradition alive by bringing a fresh perspective of young dancers - a lens that is presently overlooked and undervalued.<br/><br/>627 Stomp seeks to reach a place where it can execute its new core values. Paramount among them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing academic-quality research into Kansas City jazz culture - music, lifestyle, and dance - resulting in articles, performances, interviews, and other digestible media.</li>
<li>Providing free access and expertise on vernacular dance to disadvantaged communities who are unable to actively participate in the collective Kansas City jazz world.<ul><li>Working closely with other local non-profits to perform acts of charitable service to the less-fortunate of Kansas City.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Partnering with other historical jazz-oriented organizations, as well as leveraging our positive working relationships with local musicians, to effectively promote Kansas City as a jazz capital on a regional and national level.</li>
<li>Teaching weekly vernacular dance lessons, paired with historical background on the instructed-upon dances.</li>
<li>Creating unique, immersive events with local partners that seize upon the spirit of Kansas City jazz within the context of Prohibition.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Give a Little, Get a Little</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot make the transition to 501(c)(3) status alone. We need the help of our community to assist in achieving this milestone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on our estimates to incorporate, file applicable fees as well as the application itself to become a non-profit, we are looking to raise <strong>$1,600</strong> to achieve our goals. Any money that remains after paperwork is filed and status is approved will immediately be reinvested into our general community fund.</li>
<li>In return for the vote of confidence shown in our mission, 627 Stomp is offering the gamut of thank yous upon completion of the campaign, including, but not limited to, free private dance lessons, vintage fashion accessories crafted by members of our dance community, and free performances at your next special event.</li>
<li>If we do not reach the goal that is set for us, we will work with what we have been given, and determine alternate means to arrive at the benchmark we have set. In the spirit of transparency, we will keep all donors informed of any success or ground covered outside of this initial campaign.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We cannot express the enormous difference that you will be making by helping us reach our fundraising goal, and what that will ultimately mean for the stakeholders in the Kansas City community, whether its the part dedicated to jazz, or to the city at large:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining non-profit status puts the organization into position to apply for and receive important arts and research grants, allowing us to produce academic works on Kansas City jazz history, as well as offering greater educational dance experiences through lessons and public events.</li>
<li>Coordinating and planning community-enhancing events with other Kansas City jazz non-profits, offering a fresh, viable voice of organized young dancers and other jazz enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Allowing for the community, in turn, to have a direct and unencumbered ability to participate in the organization by creating annual donation-based memberships - whether it's a more laid-back approach of simply helping to steer us in the direction of desired monthly dance series, or being more immersive by lending your voice to board meetings.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>It's Not All About the Money!</h3>
<p>We understand that life can set unexpected challenges ahead of us, and that now might not be a good time to contribute financially. However, the spirit of community is what drives the vehicle of this endeavor. You can still help us in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Word of mouth is huge in Kansas City! Let people know about this fundraising campaign by sharing on Facebook, Instagram, and other social media! And for the more traditional among us, drop a word about us in face-to-face conversation.</li>
<li>Volunteer at 627 Stomp events! Monthly ""rent parties"" are being held with live music and refreshments, for example, and it is always appreciated to have extra hands on deck to help set-up, break-down, and clean-up before and after our guests leave.</li>

Word of mouth is huge in Kansas City! Let people know about this fundraising campaign by sharing on Facebook, Instagram, and other social media! And for the more traditional among us, drop a word about us in face-to-face conversation.
Volunteer at 627 Stomp events! Monthly ""rent parties"" are being held with live music and refreshments, for example, and it is always appreciated to have extra hands on deck to help set-up, break-down, and clean-up before and after our guests leave.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Sorrow Estate Strikes Again with The Happy EP!</h3>
<p>One year ago Sorrow Estate raised $5,000 to support the creation of their first album which can be found <a href=""https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/thesorrowestate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a> Since then Laura has been writing and working on another full-length album which is set to drop January 2018. However, that album is a bit heavy (focusing on themes of womanhood, abuse, and mental health...yikes!) so she decided to put out an EP of happy songs at the end of this summer. This campaign will fund the making of The Happy EP! The six song EP will include Sorrow Estate classics such as ""Blood Red Sunsets"" and ""Tandem"". <br/>It focuses on the beauty of relationship, love, and nature. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Hey folks! Thank you for checking out our EP crowdfunding project.</p>
<p>We're Paris Plan, a 4-piece alternative soul/RnB band based in Melbourne, Australia. We are Lauren Boomgardt (vocals), Benjamin Walters (guitar), Nathan Price (bass), and Chelsea Allen (drums). We're often joined onstage by our beautiful friend and superlative muso, Phoebe Elsworth (keys). We've had an extremely busy first year as a band - playing a bunch of great gigs, writing heaps of original music, and recording a couple of singles which we released digitally.</p>
<p>The aim of our crowdfunding project is to help us raise funds to produce our DEBUT studio EP (extended play) recording, which will be available as a CD and for digital download.</p>
<p>We're deeply passionate about our music, and we hope to produce something that our friends, families, and fans will love to listen to and be a part of. Because that's what we're creating - crowdfunded, people-powered music!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're organised, motivated and ready to record!</p>
<p>We've raised $1500 ourselves, and we need a further $6000 to cover the costs of engineering/tracking the EP in a professional studio, as well as mixing, and mastering costs. Here's how these costs breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking and mixing costs in studio: $5500</li>
<li>Mastering costs: $700</li>
<li>EP artwork: $200</li>
<li>Distribution, promotion, and printing costs: $1100</li>
</ul>
<p><br/><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>PERKS, GUYS!</span><br/><br/>The beauty of crowdfunding is that it's not all about us! In exchange for your donation to our campaign, we'll be rewarding YOU with a range of PERKS, including copies of the EP itself, launch gig tickets, our forthcoming 7"" vinyl single, cool Paris Plan merchandise like t-shirts and tote bags, executive producer credits on the EP (your name in the liner notes!), a CONCERT BY US AT YOUR PLACE, and even HUGS from the tallest, good-lookin'est member of the band! When you're ready to donate, you can check out the range of rewards on offer, with love from us to you.</p>
<h3>What if we don't hit the target?</h3>
<p>One of the benefits of using the Indiegogo platform to crowdfund an art project is their flexible funding model - that is, if we don't hit our target of $6000, we are able to keep whatever funds are partially raised. Although we're positive thinkers, and sure we'll hit our target, we do have a plan for how to use any partial funds raised. We have the ability to record fewer EP tracks (3-4), and work with our engineer on a tighter budget and to tighter timeframes. We'll need to be organised and well-rehearsed, but that's a given for us anyway.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are inherent risks in any creative project, but these can be minimised by ensuring we're working with the right people, and that we're well organised and prepared. We have set a timeframe of several days in the studio, but sometimes delays are inevitable due to sickness, family issues, technical issues, etc. To combat this, we have scheduled our studio time months in advance, and have a second contingency recording period planned, in the event of any delays. Our chosen studio recording engineer is also a friend and mentor to us, so there is a certain degree of flexibility in our recording schedule. We intend to post regular updates about our recording, so you can keep up to date with our progress!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute money to our project - no worries! Life is tough and money is tight, as we well know. But that doesn't mean that you can't help, and that we won't love your guts for any support you can give. You can still get the word out to people you might know who might be interested and able to support, or to like and share our promotional video and campaign on all the forms of social media. Help us make some NOISE! The Indiegogo share tools are an awesome way to share our project, especially on Facebook and via email.</p>
</div><h3>That's all folks!</h3><p>We're Paris Plan, and we'd be grateful for your support - directly, it'll help the music and arts scene in Melbourne thrive and flourish, and you can be proud of your contribution! With your help, we hope to contribute a collection of music that is empowered, creative, beautiful, and hopeful, with a side of ass-shaking goodness.</p></div>","Project Summary

<h3>I’ve seen this before…</h3>
<p>You may be saying, “Yeah, I’ve seen that on an archtop” or maybe on a very old Gibson. While the Reverse Tension strings going to the tail of the guitar may look familiar, you actually have not ever seen this before. On those other guitars the playing strings extend over the saddle and continue to a tailpiece that holds the strings in place. This is really not a friend of tone. Much of the energy in the vibrating strings is not forced into the top and continues traveling to the tailpiece adding no tonal value to the instrument.</p>
<p>Our playing strings terminate right behind the saddle, just like most other acoustic guitars. You can use any standard guitar strings you prefer. The separate Reverse Tension strings start in front of and continue over the saddle to the tail. Tightening our Reverse Tension tail strings to relieve the pressure of the playing strings frees the top and also applies more down pressure on the saddle. The string energy is forced into the top more efficiently. More string energy and less bracing = Volume, Sustain, Balance and Tone. There are several potential warranty issues solved by the Reverse Tension system as the top of the instrument has been stabilized and cannot pull up nor can the bridge pull off the instrument as has happened to many guitars from the past after years of the 170 to 200 pounds of forward pull from the playing strings.</p>

<h3>Beginning The End. </h3>
<p></p>
<p>For the past 6 years, the band have worked long and hard on this album. We plunged headlong into the deconstruction of percussion rhythms, mixing them up in a musical genre blender just to see what comes out. The end product of our musical and pretty emotional journey resulted in a collection of songs that make up our second full length album entitled ""<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Beginning The End</b>"".<b style=""font-weight: bold;""> </b></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;""><b></b></b></p>
<p>We are so proud to have worked with some of music's best talents on Beginning The End. The album was recorded in Singapore at 32Bit Recording Studio, before bringing the stems to Signature Sound Studio in San Diego where the vocals were finalized by band leader, Budi and mixed with Chris Cummings (Icona Pop, Avicii). Michael Patterson (for an alternate mix of the single My Aura is Wicked). The album was mastered with Gavin Lurssen of Lurssen Mastering Inc, LA, California, USA. Adam Wang (Dem)<i>, </i>whose part of Singapore's urban art collectives RSCLS and TAC, took on the challenge and responsibility of designing and the layout of Wicked Aura’s Beginning The End. </p>

Hello, we are Wicked Aura.

From the streets, where our humble beginnings as a Batucada band fired off, on the tiny island of Singapore in 2004, our love and passion for percussion and drums drew all of us together to pioneer a movement unlike any, on this little red dot. Our vision spanning 12 years has culminated in a brand new album, 6 years in the making.
Today, we embark on a new dream, a new journey, with you. We bring you BEGINNING THE END. 

We need a minimum of 25,000 USD to get this off the ground, and expect to work on this together with you. We ask that you help us raise 14,000 USD as a minimum goal, and we would do the rest.
But if you do help us reach 25,000 USD we have some more cool stuff to share with you. 
And if you help us go even further, we will add more perks for all backers thereafter!!

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>As I mentioned above, this is the next crucial step for me to emerge as a more ""legit"" artist in the eyes and ears of the music industry, not to mention listeners like YOU.  I'm playing live shows now and have no CDs to sell, which is making it hard to move forward.  People have been asking me where my CD is for months (even years) as I've been playing out while recording and wanting to finalize these tracks, and it's time for me to deliver them to walk my talk as a recording artist.  This is so much of what I'm here to do; make records and play shows, play shows and have records to sell to people who connect with the music!  An artist with a record out also has many more opportunities for publicity, getting reviews, getting tracks licensed for commercial use, and this is a great time to release this work, as I'm coming off of a good amount of press from my music video release.    </p>
<p>On a more spiritual note, I care so deeply about the health and wellness of the planet, and specifically the LGBT community, and even more specifically LGBT youth.  The more exposure I get as an artist and the more my music is out and visible, AND the more I keep going sustaining myself with record sales, the more I can grow into a leadership role for these kids and use my voice to make a difference in the world with music as my platform.  Without a record out, it's hard to do that.  </p>
<p>As I also mentioned above, I have a successful track record with implementing funds in a good way.  It was kind of amazing, surprising, and a big deal that my first music video (which i created using this Kickstarter): <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jamespanther/desirable-music-video-a-brand-new-perspective?ref=nav_search)%C2%A0was"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jamespanth...</a> got picked up by OUT.com and EQmusicblog.com, and now I just want to keep going.  I want to release this music, make more videos, write more songs, and grow my presence in the world for the benefit of all. </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Honestly, what is amazing about this platform is that it's low risk for me.  To juxtapose this platform with something else, I'd like to share something with you.  Last month, I launched my second Kickstarter to raise money for me to go on a national tour and partner with big LGBT rights organizations in addition to releasing this EP.  I asked for $15,000 so i could do a huge, radically LGBT-youth-centered national tour, organizing all ages shows and playing anywhere in the country that would have me.  </p>
<p>After about a week, I realized I didn't have the energy to raise the funds for and promote something that big by myself, and so I chose to let it go.  I realized that I made a Kickstarter for one of my overarching life goals, and bit off more than I can chew right for this summer.  Combining the high monetary goal with Kickstarter's all-or-nothing model made the pressure overwhelming.  I've since gone inside myself and had a strong insight that it's best for me to stay close to home in the Pacific Northwest at this stage, release this record, generate more exposure, and continue playing in my bio-region, adding members to my live show setup, and generating some new live video content for youtube.  </p>
<p>So all that said, I can honestly say that everything is set up to have a simple and successful release if and when I raise these funds!  The record is mostly recorded and just needs some final mixing and mastering, the engineers are lined up and ready to go, as are my publicist, booking agent, and distribution platforms and CD pressers.  </p>

The release of this initial EP (short record) is following an incredibly beautiful ride I've had over the last few months, creating and releasing my first self-produced and self-directed single and music video for my song ""desirable"".  You can check out the gorgeous video my team and I were able to make here, thanks to a successful Kickstarter campaign last summer:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKR_nWsCeYc.  We were able to do a lot on a $5,000 budget.  So much, actually, that both OUT.com  (OUT magazine) and EQmusicblog.com premiered the video for me and interviewed me about it, which was awesome.

OUT magazine premiere (and interview): http://www.out.com/music/2015/3/17/exclusive-ja...
EQmusicblog premiere (and interview): http://eqmusicblog.com/premiere-watch-desirable...

I'm really excited to release my debut EP as James Panther.  I've been a singer/songwriter for 13 years, and this will be the first record I'll be publicizing.  It is really important for me to have a release out so that anyone can have copies of the songs I've worked so hard to record and produce the way I want.  Some of them have been waiting for 3 years to be released!  Having the record on iTunes and other digital downloading platforms and on CD, as well as getting press out in the world is the next crucial step forward for me.   
What I Need & What You Get I need $5,000 to get YOU and the world my music, and the money will be allocated for the following (from highest priority onward):  additional mixing and mastering 
graphic design for album cover
pressing CDs
digital distribution for album

publicity

remixes of ""Desirable"" (so the empowering track can live in the clubs!)
cheap, reliable car for tour

<div>Hi! My name is Shea. I am an R&amp;B/Soul singer,songwriter, and recording artist. I am from Lake Ozark, Missouri and currently reside in Temecula, California. I have decided to start my own Indiegogo campaign in order to raise money and support for the new Electronic Press Kit that I am working on in order to better brand myself and my music. I am working on this particular project because I feel that it will give me a better edge and help me stand out professionally as a singer and songwriter.  I was very hesitant, and still am in some ways, about starting a campaign like this, but decided to try it out anyways. I figure that sometimes the things that make you a little uncomfortable just may be some of the best things for you. </div>
<div>Get to know me:</div>
<div> While growing up, I was constantly learning how to sculpt my craft and solidifying more about who I wanted to be as an individual, artistically and personally. I learned quickly that music was a strong passion for me even before I had learned how to share it openly with others. Because my mom was a singer as well, I was able to experience many of her shows in an up close and personal way at a very young age.  My mom pushed us to learn how to be comfortable in front of people we didn't know when we would perform together for different events. Performing for others can be a difficult task on its own, but try performing alongside your family members when dressed up as an elf, reindeer, and Mrs. Claus with sets of jingle bells in both hands. Needless to say, I was not allowed to be shy.</div>
<div>  We grew up listening to all different musical genres, however, R&amp;B and Soul have definitely been my favorites consistently. I started playing piano when I was about 7 years old and after a couple of years of lessons I started testing my luck at learning how to play piano by ear. Playing by ear helped me push to experiment with songwriting. I was involved heavily with choir and band throughout my years in high school. Even though I was also involved in sports and other activities, I'd have to say that I was quite the music nerd and I'm dang proud of it!</div>
<div>After graduating high school, I pushed toward my degree at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.  Although Speech Pathology is an unbelievably worthwhile and meaningful career path, my passion has still maintained to be within my music. Ultimately, I have all these original ideas that I would love to share with the world through my songs. I have a unique style and a free mind that keeps me from being scared to create something a little bit different from the current norms. My music is typically very positive and mellow with a soulful edge. </div>
<div> The most difficult part is that many times my passion also comes with a cost. If you are choosing to help me fund this project, you are essentially helping me to place my passion first as a career path and showing the additional support that I need as an independent artist.  I truly appreciate those of you that choose to be a part of this journey with me even if you are not able to contribute financially!</div> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The SHEA Project &amp; What You Get Back.</h3> <p>I am looking to create a 6 or 7 song EPK ( Electronic Press Kit) album in order to present myself in more of an appropriate way to record label representatives, as well as to the general public. The album will be released to iTunes when completed! In a lot of ways, this project is meant to re-brand myself as an artist or at least polish what I already have in the works. Also, I'm looking to put the project out within the next 6 months! This project includes:</p>
<p>-Studio and Recording Expenses (Recording, Mixing, Mastering, Etc.):<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""> $500-$700 per song</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">-Photography (Album Art, Website Photography, Etc.): $200-$800</span></p>
<p>-Videography (Professional music video for at least one of the songs off of the album):$600-$2500</p>
<p>-Copywriting expenses: $200-$450</p>
<p>-iTunes Registration: $35-$250</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These are some basic cost ranges and estimations for some of the processes involved in this project. I have not set my goal at the actual amount that it will take for the full project, but rather at closer to 50 percent of what I will actually need. Even if I do not reach my entire goal for this fundraiser the money raised will still be put toward these costs for the project. </p>
<p>If you donate I will be sending you thank you gifts as soon as the campaign ends! Please check out the list of perks for more information!</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges.</h3> <p>There is a lot of risk putting together a fundraiser as such because you are definitely putting yourself out on the line. It's difficult to ask people for money, especially when everyone has their own daily struggles, and it is not something I typically allow myself to do. Please do not donate if you are in a financial struggle of your own and your contribution to my project would further that burden! There are plenty of other ways you can show your support that don't involve money!</p>

<p>Technology has transformed the world and our culture, allowing
instantaneous communication, real-time news and information of all sorts, from
every possible viewpoint.  But there is
one important area where the promise of technology remains unfulfilled, and
that is in allowing free access to the vast archive of recorded music, shows
and performances from the inception of recorded sound to today.  Even worse, since the invention of recording,
America has adopted this technology to the exclusion of all else, so that
recordings are the only archival historical resource that remains relevant, and
unfortunately, those recordings are locked up, with some available to those who
can afford to purchase them, but most gathering dust in a vault.  </p>
<p>Our culture is literally buried in a Time Capsule.</p>
<p>About a year ago, American Songbook Preservation Society set
out to build a digital repository to make these precious resources available to
anyone, for free.  What we found is
reminiscent of a post-apocalyptic science fiction movie, with a barren landscape dominated
by warring factions.  Being the plucky
anti-heroes that we are, we are wading into this quagmire and are asking you to
join us, not to defeat some evil empire, but to save a bunch of great music
from irrelevance and create a new space in American culture for pop music that
is past its popularity, and too good to be consigned to the cultural trash
heap.  </p>
<p>And so we present to you - the Great American Songbook.  </p>
<p>The period from 1920 to 1960 represents the apex of American
popular music, that produced a treasure trove of talented musicians the likes
of which the world has never known before or since.  From vocalists like Frank Sinatra and Ella
Fitzgerald and composers/lyricists such as George and Ira Gershwin and Irving
Berlin, America gifted the world with music of a higher caliber, but today that
music has all but disappeared from the cultural landscape.</p>
<p>The Great American Songbook is a body of music that is lauded
the world over for representing the zenith of American culture and songwriting
at its best.  And it has never before
been so important to take action to preserve and restore this vital cultural resource
and access to it.  With vinyl and compact
disc recordings quickly becoming a distant memory, record stores disappearing
and live performance dwindling, there is a very real danger that this music
will be lost to future generations. 
Perhaps Tony Bennett put it best when he said, “This is America’s
classical music.”</p>
<p>As you might imagine, bringing this vast resource to a place
where anyone can access it, for free, is going to be a huge undertaking that
will require lots and lots of money.  But
we are two guys, who don't have millions to throw down, so we beginning with
much more humble goals.</p>
<p><b><u>Cataloging/Preservation/Education</u></b></p>
<p>We have established a wiki at
<a href=""http://www.greatamericansongbook.org/wiki"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.greatamericansongbook.org/wiki</a> to catalog and link to existing performances
around the Internet and also to serve as a repository for recordings and
educational materials developed by American Songbook Preservation Society.  We will need a small army of volunteer
contributors and moderators to keep the information up to date as new resources
become available and others vanish.  Our immediate
goal for this part of the project is to determine what is out there with a much
better degree of certainty than is possible at the present.  As this effort gains momentum, we look toward
establishing an Oral History Project, creating original multimedia resources
and engaging in advocacy aimed at resolving copyright restrictions that
currently make our goal of free access prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p><b><u>Performance</u></b></p>
<p>We want to host an Inaugural Gala Concert as a way of promoting
the music, giving opportunities for singers and musicians to practice their
craft.  On July 4, 2016, we want to put
on the biggest concert we can afford, based on the level of donations received,
to promote the Great American Songbook to an ever-widening group of advocates
who will attend, volunteer and help fund more concerts in areas throughout the
country. </p>
<p><b><u>Team</u></b></p>
<p>Ronald S. Kaplan</p>
<p>Ron Kaplan is a singer who has focused his career on continuing
the tradition of performing songs from the Popular and Jazz Standards of the
Great American Songbook. He performs regularly, and has released nine albums,
including his most recent, a career retrospective that was released in 2014.  In addition to his career as a
concert performer and recording artist, Ron Kaplan also is the founder and
executive director of American Songbook Preservation Society, which for twelve years has been pursuing the goal of
preserving the cultural resource known as the Great American Songbook.</p>
<p>Stuart I. McCammon</p>
<p>Stuart I. McCammon has enjoyed a long career in the nonprofit
sector, including stints at Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, University of
Southern California and Children's Hospital Foundation of Orange County.  He is a nonprofit serial entrepreneur, building
successful programs from scratch, and has been fortunate to work alongside many
experts in a variety of areas including website development, video production,
nonprofit management, event marketing, direct mail, annual giving, nonprofit
law, corporate/foundation relations, major and planned gifts, cause-related
marketing and school/governmental agency collaborations.</p>
<p><b><u>Funding/Rewards</u></b></p>
<p>Our goal for this Indiegogo project is $50,000.  With that, we feel like we can get the wiki
started off successfully and throw one heck of a party/concert on July 4,
2016.  But more importantly, we want to
engage people - as many as we possibly can, because that is what is going to
breathe life into this music.  We figure
there will be a whole bunch of people who get excited about the Great American
Songbook and decide to support one of the many other groups that are working on
different aspects of this music, and that is OK.  We also hope that many, many people will
rediscover these performances and decide not to wait for our digital repository
to be built, and just go ahead and buy recordings for their personal enjoyment,
and that is OK too.  And if we don't
raise the $50,000 that is also OK.  We
have already put up the wiki, and will still host a concert at whatever
level is possible with the donations received.  The concert will be located in the Aptos, California area, and all tickets are for admission only, and do not include any travel to or from the concert venue.<br/></p><p>

<b><u>Impact</u></b>
<p>We see a future where schools can access free sheet music
and arrangements of Great American Songbook music, where singers and musicians
have a rich, vibrant array of opportunities to perform this music for others,
where legions of fans can access archival footage of old performances and
appreciate new, talented singers and musicians that are keeping the flame alive.  This music is too good to consign to a museum
- it needs to be seen, heard and performed, and this Indiegogo Project is just
a humble beginning of a huge vision to preserve and protect a uniquely American
cultural treasure.</p>
<p><b><u>Risks and
Challenges</u></b></p>
<p>We have dealt with all of those along the way to
conceptualizing the Indiegogo Project you see today.  We set out a year ago to establish the
digital repository, and found that copyright holders want huge sums to access
their assets, that video copyright is still prohibitively expensive and
oriented more toward showing in movie theaters than on the Internet, and that very
little of these performances are even available.  We would like to address all of these issues
as we raise funds, engage in advocacy and establish relationships with
copyright holders, but for now, this project is viable and free from the
obstacles that led us to this path.</p>
<p><b><u>Other Ways You Can
Help</u></b></p>
<p>Anything you can do to promote  this project to your friends is appreciated -
we are aggressively pursuing interview opportunities and free advertisements in
all media, and when it gets down to it, we are a nonprofit.  Join the American Songbook Preservation
Society.  Contact us if you want to start
a chapter - we haven't gone there yet, but would love to see this effort go all
grassroots on us.  Have a carwash, start
a memorial fund for a loved one, tell your friends to send us money instead of
wedding presents - the possibilities are limited only by your imagination.  And we can't do it without you.</p>
<p></p></div>","Save Our Songbook
Technology has transformed the world and our culture, allowing
instantaneous communication, real-time news and information of all sorts, from
every possible viewpoint.  But there is
one important area where the promise of technology remains unfulfilled, and
that is in allowing free access to the vast archive of recorded music, shows
and performances from the inception of recorded sound to today.  Even worse, since the invention of recording,
America has adopted this technology to the exclusion of all else, so that
recordings are the only archival historical resource that remains relevant, and
unfortunately, those recordings are locked up, with some available to those who
can afford to purchase them, but most gathering dust in a vault.  
Our culture is literally buried in a Time Capsule.
About a year ago, American Songbook Preservation Society set
out to build a digital repository to make these precious resources available to
anyone, for free.  What we found is
reminiscent of a post-apocalyptic science fiction movie, with a barren landscape dominated
by warring factions.  Being the plucky
anti-heroes that we are, we are wading into this quagmire and are asking you to
join us, not to defeat some evil empire, but to save a bunch of great music
from irrelevance and create a new space in American culture for pop music that
is past its popularity, and too good to be consigned to the cultural trash
heap.  
And so we present to you - the Great American Songbook.  
The period from 1920 to 1960 represents the apex of American
popular music, that produced a treasure trove of talented musicians the likes
of which the world has never known before or since.  From vocalists like Frank Sinatra and Ella
Fitzgerald and composers/lyricists such as George and Ira Gershwin and Irving
Berlin, America gifted the world with music of a higher caliber, but today that
music has all but disappeared from the cultural landscape.
The Great American Songbook is a body of music that is lauded
the world over for representing the zenith of American culture and songwriting
at its best.  And it has never before
been so important to take action to preserve and restore this vital cultural resource
and access to it.  With vinyl and compact
disc recordings quickly becoming a distant memory, record stores disappearing
and live performance dwindling, there is a very real danger that this music
will be lost to future generations. 
Perhaps Tony Bennett put it best when he said, “This is America’s
classical music.”
As you might imagine, bringing this vast resource to a place
where anyone can access it, for free, is going to be a huge undertaking that
will require lots and lots of money.  But
we are two guys, who don't have millions to throw down, so we beginning with
much more humble goals.
Cataloging/Preservation/Education
We have established a wiki at
www.greatamericansongbook.org/wiki to catalog and link to existing performances
around the Internet and also to serve as a repository for recordings and
educational materials developed by American Songbook Preservation Society.  We will need a small army of volunteer
contributors and moderators to keep the information up to date as new resources
become available and others vanish.  Our immediate
goal for this part of the project is to determine what is out there with a much
better degree of certainty than is possible at the present.  As this effort gains momentum, we look toward
establishing an Oral History Project, creating original multimedia resources
and engaging in advocacy aimed at resolving copyright restrictions that
currently make our goal of free access prohibitively expensive.
Performance
We want to host an Inaugural Gala Concert as a way of promoting
the music, giving opportunities for singers and musicians to practice their
craft.  On July 4, 2016, we want to put
on the biggest concert we can afford, based on the level of donations received,
to promote the Great American Songbook to an ever-widening group of advocates
who will attend, volunteer and help fund more concerts in areas throughout the
country. 
Team
Ronald S. Kaplan
Ron Kaplan is a singer who has focused his career on continuing
the tradition of performing songs from the Popular and Jazz Standards of the
Great American Songbook. He performs regularly, and has released nine albums,
including his most recent, a career retrospective that was released in 2014.  In addition to his career as a
concert performer and recording artist, Ron Kaplan also is the founder and
executive director of American Songbook Preservation Society, which for twelve years has been pursuing the goal of
preserving the cultural resource known as the Great American Songbook.
Stuart I. McCammon
Stuart I. McCammon has enjoyed a long career in the nonprofit
sector, including stints at Boys & Girls Clubs of America, University of
Southern California and Children's Hospital Foundation of Orange County.  He is a nonprofit serial entrepreneur, building
successful programs from scratch, and has been fortunate to work alongside many
experts in a variety of areas including website development, video production,
nonprofit management, event marketing, direct mail, annual giving, nonprofit
law, corporate/foundation relations, major and planned gifts, cause-related
marketing and school/governmental agency collaborations.
Funding/Rewards
Our goal for this Indiegogo project is $50,000.  With that, we feel like we can get the wiki
started off successfully and throw one heck of a party/concert on July 4,
2016.  But more importantly, we want to
engage people - as many as we possibly can, because that is what is going to
breathe life into this music.  We figure
there will be a whole bunch of people who get excited about the Great American
Songbook and decide to support one of the many other groups that are working on
different aspects of this music, and that is OK.  We also hope that many, many people will
rediscover these performances and decide not to wait for our digital repository
to be built, and just go ahead and buy recordings for their personal enjoyment,
and that is OK too.  And if we don't
raise the $50,000 that is also OK.  We
have already put up the wiki, and will still host a concert at whatever
level is possible with the donations received.  The concert will be located in the Aptos, California area, and all tickets are for admission only, and do not include any travel to or from the concert venue.

<h3>This project for “A Chain Rapture Tour” include J-Pop Summit Festival and making a new CD！</h3>
<h2><br/></h2>
<h3>[Project Concept]<br/>
</h3>
<p>It's been 5 years since we played our very first show overseas. And we keep playing overseas too now. It means so much. We are greatly grateful for your continuous attentions and many loves to our band and music. <br/></p>
<p>We are a unsigned band. We have been working on tour arrangements and promotions by ourselves so far, being helped by many people who supports us. And this year, our band will be 10 years old in August. This is amazing! But we also feel we need to do something new now to grow our band bigger, like to find sponsors, bookers, recording labels, etc. Financial issues are now getting bigger to us these years.<br/></p>
<p>Fortunately, we've got several official invitations and slots to play shows from some music events from many other countries. But we had to give up some of those opportunities for high travel expenses. We are facing a problem. We have been managing our band expenses by engaging in our daily jobs. But now, we need to fix our whole band business, especially financial. We need to catch up with expanding our own band activities to hand our music to the world. <br/></p>Your kind considerations and helps here will bring the band good exposure. J-Pop Summit Festival that we are attending is getting bigger. We believe it could be a great chance for our promotion. And your supports here also make us able to reach the east coast to hand our latest album that we launched last summer. We couldn't make it to the east coast last year. <br/><br/>Please get the band out to the tour!<br/><br/><p>Your helps will make the band better!!</p>
<p>We are now making new songs and special limited tees and bandanas only for this project! <br/></p>

<h4>[Band formation]</h4>
<p></p>
<p>In 2005, Miki Uchizono (the bassist of the band) started to form a band; The Akabane Vulgars on Strong Bypass. She got her sister, Yumi Uchizono, for a guitarist and vocalist, and also got Kei Sofue for a drummer. After a month later from their gathering, they had their first show. They just played covers. It was august, 2005, Miki and Kei still were senior high school students. After played covers from Japanese garage rocks over a year, the band started making their own songs.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>[Strong motivation for playing shows]</h4>

This project for “A Chain Rapture Tour” include J-Pop Summit Festival and making a new CD！

[Project Concept]

It's been 5 years since we played our very first show overseas. And we keep playing overseas too now. It means so much. We are greatly grateful for your continuous attentions and many loves to our band and music. 
We are a unsigned band. We have been working on tour arrangements and promotions by ourselves so far, being helped by many people who supports us. And this year, our band will be 10 years old in August. This is amazing! But we also feel we need to do something new now to grow our band bigger, like to find sponsors, bookers, recording labels, etc. Financial issues are now getting bigger to us these years.
Fortunately, we've got several official invitations and slots to play shows from some music events from many other countries. But we had to give up some of those opportunities for high travel expenses. We are facing a problem. We have been managing our band expenses by engaging in our daily jobs. But now, we need to fix our whole band business, especially financial. We need to catch up with expanding our own band activities to hand our music to the world. Your kind considerations and helps here will bring the band good exposure. J-Pop Summit Festival that we are attending is getting bigger. We believe it could be a great chance for our promotion. And your supports here also make us able to reach the east coast to hand our latest album that we launched last summer. We couldn't make it to the east coast last year. Please get the band out to the tour!Your helps will make the band better!!
We are now making new songs and special limited tees and bandanas only for this project!

[Band BIO]

[Band formation]

In 2005, Miki Uchizono (the bassist of the band) started to form a band; The Akabane Vulgars on Strong Bypass. She got her sister, Yumi Uchizono, for a guitarist and vocalist, and also got Kei Sofue for a drummer. After a month later from their gathering, they had their first show. They just played covers. It was august, 2005, Miki and Kei still were senior high school students. After played covers from Japanese garage rocks over a year, the band started making their own songs.

[Strong motivation for playing shows]

Since their gathering, they have been very strenuous to play shows. They did about 5 shows a month tops. The band mentioned about this that, we feel there are numerous things happening during a show, which tells us so many.  That's why we think we need to be on stage. Experienced many shows, the band produced 3 DYI albums byKei Sofue(Dr.)  Yumi Uchizono(Gt.Vo.)  Miki Uchizono(Ba.) 2011. Then, in 2012, their energy for shows jumped out of Japan.

[Music and concepts]

They call themselves a punk band. Their thoughts for indifference to discriminations, and their anger for things unenlightened causing“AEON”Jul 2014“Proclamation”Jun 2013“Live in Brooklyn“Jun 2013 discriminations, those in their minds made their songs strongly spirited and unique. And being genuine is a their motto. Excessive rejection to acting like a imitation rock musician, which give unique fierceness and passion to their performance. Literally, hundreds of shows grew the band.

<p>It is not a secret that female representation in the music industry is significantly less compared to men and this is something that can and should change. And I also believe that one of the reasons for this is the lack of resources and information.</p>
<p>So that's why I believe that sharing my own journey and those of other women who are killing it  in the music business will serve as  great inspiration for a  <b>NEW GENERATION OF FEMALE LEADERS IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.</b></p>

<p>Para nadie es un secreto que la representación femenina en la industria de la música es considerablemente menor a la masculina, y creo que uno de los motivos para esto es la falta de información y recursos disponibles. </p>
<p>Por ello creo que compartir mi propia experiencia así como la de otras mujeres que ya lo están haciendo servirá de inspiración para una <b>NUEVA GENERACIÓN DE LÍDERES FEMENINAS EN LA INDUSTRIA DE LA MÚSICA.</b></p>

I'm a Music Business Consultant from SAE Institute and an events manager.

Soy graduada de Music Business de SAE Institute y soy productora de eventos.

The Project / El Proyecto





I want to be a Tour Manager, but I've heard it's tough out there on the road for a girl. Fortunately I've been given a scholarship to attend CATO Academy, a training program in London to learn everything there is to know about the touring side of the music industry.

What I want to do is create a web series  to share my own experience attending CATO and also find other women who are already working as Tour Managers, Stage Managers, Roadies, Sound Engineers, and other live music related professions.
Mi meta es ser Tour Manager, pero he escuchado que este un trabajo difícil para una mujer. He tenido la fortuna de recibir una beca para asistir a CATO Academy, un programa de formación en Londres para aprender todo lo relacionado con la industria de la música en directo y las giras.
Me propongo crear una web serie para documentar mi propia experiencia como estudiante de CATO y también me propongo conectar con otras mujeres que ya están trabajando como Tour Managers, Stage Managers, Roadies, Ingenieros de Sonido, etc.






My goal is to bring these women forward and share their stories, so we can create a HUB OF INFORMATION for other women that might be interested in making a career in live music, but don't even know where to start!


Mi objetivo es compartir estas historias, de estas mujeres y la mía propia, y crear un Centro de Información digital para otras mujeres que pudiesen estar interesadas en esta carrera pero quizás no saben por donde empezar





The timeline would be as follows:
- August-November 2015: CATO Course in London - Research and Interviews.
- December 2015: Going to New York City to find more women!
- January-February 2016: Editing of all the footage.
- March 2016: Launch of the Web Series.


El programa del proyecto sería:
- Agosto-Noviembre 2015: CATO Academy en Londres - Investigación y entrevistas.
- Diciembre 2015: New York - Investigación y entrevistas.
- Enero - Febrero 2016: Edición del material.
- Marzo 2016: Lanzamiento de la Web Serie.






What I'm most excited about is being able to show other women what's out there and make them aware of all the challenges and opportunities that they might find while breaking into this profession. We'll do it together!

Lo que más me emociona del proyecto es poder mostrar de primera mano todas las oportunidades y retos que existen para las mujeres que quisieran empezar esta carrera.

What you're getting for your support 
¿Qué obtienes por tu apoyo?




Apart from participating in an awesome project, you'll get to be featured as Executive Producer of the series, and be a proud supporter of significant future changes in the music industry. You will also get early access to the finished materials and other exciting perks.


Serás acreditado como Productor Ejecutivo de la serie, recibirás el material terminado de forma exclusiva por adelantado y podrás contribuir activamente en un proyecto que puede significar un primer paso hacia grandes cambios en la industria de la música. También hay otras recompensas muy guapas!




What the funding is for / ¿Para qué son los fondos?







All the funding that I receive will be broken down into:- The rest of the course's tuition fees not covered by the scholarship (1000 GBP).- Living costs while in London: Flights & Visa Costs, Housing, Food, Transport, Internet.- Production costs: Filming Equipment, External HD, Post Production.



Todos los fondos serán utilizados para lo siguiente:- La parte restante de la matrícula del curso no cubierta por la beca (1000 GBP).- Manutención en Londres por 3 meses: Billetes de avión, alojamiento, alimentación, transporte e internet.- Costos de Producción: Equipos de filmación, disco duro externo, post-producción y edición.








I believe this is important. Do you?


It is not a secret that female representation in the music industry is significantly less compared to men and this is something that can and should change. And I also believe that one of the reasons for this is the lack of resources and information.
So that's why I believe that sharing my own journey and those of other women who are killing it  in the music business will serve as  great inspiration for a  NEW GENERATION OF FEMALE LEADERS IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.

¿Crees que es un tema importante?

Para nadie es un secreto que la representación femenina en la industria de la música es considerablemente menor a la masculina, y creo que uno de los motivos para esto es la falta de información y recursos disponibles. 
Por ello creo que compartir mi propia experiencia así como la de otras mujeres que ya lo están haciendo servirá de inspiración para una NUEVA GENERACIÓN DE LÍDERES FEMENINAS EN LA INDUSTRIA DE LA MÚSICA.




SO, GO AHEAD, MAKE MY DAY! :)

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>This
is not an easy task. At first I thought not raising my goal was the biggest
risk and challenge but it’s not. The hard part is setting aside my fears and
choosing vulnerability. Choosing to show you where I am at but also where I
could and wish to be.  I’m choosing to
not just be a dreamer but to be a doer as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*If I don't reach my goal, I will have to work with what I've raised and produce less...Maybe one or two songs instead of three.</p>

Hello Family! Saudia Young actress/singer/waitress is here back in the funding saddle again!
I have a few Big Wig Gigs coming up and I really could use that classic 'Little Black Dress and Heels' to fit the bill!
 If you add to the cash You will help me through the front door instead of the back one, at the swanky events, so I can Blow their Socks off and snag some more well paying gigs and opportunities in the future!     We Need 500 Euros for Saudia's new Betty Page Dress & Riccardo Cartillone shoes!
   Betty Page dress is 180 Euros  The shoes are 300
Dress is priority because I can probably pull it off with shoes that I have already but you know what they say. 'The Shoes Make The Woman' !



History & Back Story & ... the Future  The idea was prescribed by my friend & confidence Doctor:  Laura Johnson AKA Lady L.
 Past funding stats: I successfully raised funds and produced 2 EPs. This action is virtually re-opening the Pandora's Artist Funding box for me  because I am madly writing a new album as you read this. Stay tuned for that fundraiser. It will be a Kicker.
    Risks & Challenges  Transparency. .  I am very qualified to spend your money on pretty things that I will prance around the stage in. Any extra money raised will be used for Rice, Beans & Crémant (Champagne)
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Please discretely  get the word out and make some noise  to a few friends who you think would dig it. Use the Indiegogo share tools!   Thank you for your time and money! Love Saudia",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p>Erwin Schrümpf betreibt seit ca. 2 Jahren erfolgreich den Verein</p>
<p><b>""griechenlandhilfe.at""</b>. Mit seinem Einsatz versorgt er notleidende Menschen in Griechenland. Damit, Ihre medizinische und humanitäre Versorgung gesichert ist. Die Lage wird immer schlimmer. Der Staat und auch andere Hilfsorganisationen sehen zu.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Unsere Ziele</h3>
<p>Wir haben uns vorrangig das Ziel gesetzt die Griechenlandhilfe Österreich mit mehr Spenden zu versorgen damit Erwin noch effektiver und öfter helfen kann.</p>
<ul>
<li>15000€ Startup für die nächste Lieferung</li>
<li>Den Verein dauerhaft zu unterstützen durch Weiterführen der Kampagne<br/>
</li>
<li>Für einen weiteren LKW zu sammeln um die Lieferkapazität zu erhöhen<br/>
</li>
<li>Inbetriebnahme einer ""Griechenland Österreich.at"" Aussenstelle auf Kreta</li>
<li>Regelmässige Hilfsmaßnamen vorort</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Wo die Politik versagt, dort leiden die Menschen<br/>
</h3>Ich finde es beschämend, dass in unserer modernen Gesellschaft der Mensch so wenig zählt wie derzeit.<br/>Politiker beraten wie Banken geretten werden können und Steuern erhöht werden und Pensionen gekürzt werden sollen. In den Medien bejubelt man, wenn die Kurse der Aktien wieder steigen (daneben ein Bild mit gefüllten Sektgläsern)<br/><br/>In einer deutschen Agenturmeldung der ""Frankfuter Allgemeine"" las ich folgende <b>Mitteilung:</b><br/>BERLIN (dpa-AFX) - <b>Das Deutsche Rote Kreuz
 steht für humanitäre Nothilfe in Griechenland bereit.</b> ""Das gilt für den
 Fall, dass sich die Lage vor Ort weiter verschlimmern sollte"", sagte 
DRK-Sprecher Dieter Schütz der Deutschen Presse-Agentur am Mittwoch. 
<b>Konkrete Pläne für einen Einsatz in dem von der Staatspleite bedrohten 
Land gebe es aber nicht</b>. Allerdings habe Griechenland bereits Probleme 
bei der medizinischen Versorgung. Dies bekämen vor allem Rentner, Arme, 
Kranke und Flüchtlinge zu spüren. Befürchtet werden auch Engpässe bei 
der Grundversorgung, sollte sich die finanzielle Lage zuspitzen.<br/><br/> Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit und Armut machen sich bereits bei den SOS 
Kinderdörfern in Griechenland bemerkbar. Zurzeit bitten fünfzigmal so 
viele Familien bei der Organisation um Hilfe wie noch vor der Krise, 
sagte der Leiter der dortigen Kinderdörfer, George Protopapas, dem 
""Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland"". Viele Familien drohten 
auseinanderzubrechen./ggr/DP/fbr<br/>???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????<br/><br/>Auf was warten sie? Sie haben noch keine Pläne?????<br/>In den täglichen Berichten zb.auf NTV sind immer die Banken und die Aktien im Focus, aber sogut wie nie ""der Mensch"", der darunter leidet was andere verbockt haben!!!!! <br/>Liebe Politiker, vergesst nie wer der Staat ist. Nicht die Banken oder die Aktien, sondern das Volk.<br/><b>Mein Motto ist: Geht es dem Volk gut, dann geht es dem Staat gut.<br/><br/></b>
</div><div> <h3>Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann</h3> <p></p>
</div><p>
    Dringend benötigtes
</p>
<p>
<strong>Angesichts der zunehmend schwieriger werdenden Lage brauchen wir dringend eure Unterstützung.</strong>
</p>

    • Babynahrung<br/>
    • Blutzuckerstäbchen<br/>

    • OP-Masken<br/>
    • Verbandsstoffe<br/>
    • Scheren und Pinzetten<br/>
    • Schienen und Gipsverbände

Wo die Politik versagt, dort leiden die Menschen
Ich finde es beschämend, dass in unserer modernen Gesellschaft der Mensch so wenig zählt wie derzeit.Politiker beraten wie Banken geretten werden können und Steuern erhöht werden und Pensionen gekürzt werden sollen. In den Medien bejubelt man, wenn die Kurse der Aktien wieder steigen (daneben ein Bild mit gefüllten Sektgläsern)In einer deutschen Agenturmeldung der ""Frankfuter Allgemeine"" las ich folgende Mitteilung:BERLIN (dpa-AFX) - Das Deutsche Rote Kreuz
 steht für humanitäre Nothilfe in Griechenland bereit. ""Das gilt für den
 Fall, dass sich die Lage vor Ort weiter verschlimmern sollte"", sagte 
DRK-Sprecher Dieter Schütz der Deutschen Presse-Agentur am Mittwoch. 
Konkrete Pläne für einen Einsatz in dem von der Staatspleite bedrohten 
Land gebe es aber nicht. Allerdings habe Griechenland bereits Probleme 
bei der medizinischen Versorgung. Dies bekämen vor allem Rentner, Arme, 
Kranke und Flüchtlinge zu spüren. Befürchtet werden auch Engpässe bei 
der Grundversorgung, sollte sich die finanzielle Lage zuspitzen. Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit und Armut machen sich bereits bei den SOS 
Kinderdörfern in Griechenland bemerkbar. Zurzeit bitten fünfzigmal so 
viele Familien bei der Organisation um Hilfe wie noch vor der Krise, 
sagte der Leiter der dortigen Kinderdörfer, George Protopapas, dem 
""Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland"". Viele Familien drohten 
auseinanderzubrechen./ggr/DP/fbr???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Auf was warten sie? Sie haben noch keine Pläne?????In den täglichen Berichten zb.auf NTV sind immer die Banken und die Aktien im Focus, aber sogut wie nie ""der Mensch"", der darunter leidet was andere verbockt haben!!!!! Liebe Politiker, vergesst nie wer der Staat ist. Nicht die Banken oder die Aktien, sondern das Volk.Mein Motto ist: Geht es dem Volk gut, dann geht es dem Staat gut.
 Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann 

    Dringend benötigtes


Angesichts der zunehmend schwieriger werdenden Lage brauchen wir dringend eure Unterstützung.



    Am dringendsten gebraucht werden folgende medizinischen Hilfsmittel und Waren des täglichen Gebrauchs:


    • Windeln in allen Größen
    • Babyöl und Cremen
    • Babynahrung
    • Blutzuckerstäbchen

    Wir freuen uns deshalb über jede Unterstützung mit Sachspenden (die auch über unsere Amazon-Wunschliste bestellt und direkt an unser Lager versendet werden können).


    Kleiderspenden können wir leider nicht berücksichtigen, da diese 
beim Transport zu viel Platz benötigen würden, den wir für 
lebenswichtige Güter benötigen. Wir bitten um Verständnis!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hello friends, old and new! It is with great excitement that
we announce the official crowd funding campaign for the Jim
Shaneberger Band’s NEW ALBUM! It has been just over two years since we released
“Work In Progress”, and it has afforded us many great opportunities as a band,
as well as giving us the opportunity to meet lots of amazing people. We want to
pass along our heartfelt thanks to everyone who bought a copy of “Work In
Progress”, pledged to the Kickstarter campaign which made it possible, has come out to our shows
and has become our friends over the past few years. Without all of your support,
none of this would be possible.</p>
<p><b>Rundown of The Album:</b></p>
<p>Now, onto what we are doing here. Our first album (Work In Progress) was recorded in Grand Haven, MI at Bill Chrysler's former studio, Redwall North, with our good friend Joe Sturgill engineering. It was a great experience and the album turned out great. We have decided to
record the second album with the amazing Bill Chrysler
himself at the brand new Bill Chrysler Studios. Bill is one of the premier sound engineers in the world and has worked
with the most prominent names in the music business for decades. Some of the
artists Bill has worked with over the years include: Paul McCartney, John
Mayer, The Eagles, Maroon 5, Bob Seger, Christina Aguilera, John Legend, Van Morrison, Tom
Petty and many more. Needless to say, Bill is incredible and very respected in
the music industry and it is our pleasure to say that Bill will be co-producing the new album! The album is currently in production and we think you are going to dig it! Now that we have solidified the
lineup of the band, we have been working diligently to write the album together. This album is much more band-focused and we're recording it live with minimal overdubs. It is all original music and, while staying true to
our musical roots, we feel it will show a different side of the band that we
are very excited about!</p>
<p><b>How You Can Help: </b></p>
<p>The reason we have put this campaign together is because we
need your help! When all totaled, an album is very costly to complete. There are
several things to take into consideration when budgeting to make an album,
including: recording, mixing and mastering, duplication, art, promotion and
more. That’s where you come in!  As you can see in the ‘Perks’ section of this campaign,
the more you pledge to making the album, the better the perks will be. There is
everything from a digital download of the album to a private, full band
performance and everything in between. If you find yourself in position to give
to this campaign, you will get some really cool stuff before anyone else and we would really
appreciate it! We feel it will be something that you can be proud to help get
off the ground. Let's make this album together!</p><p>If you're not in a position to give financially, we completely understand. The good news is you can still help by sharing our campaign with all of your friends and networks!</p>

<p>Every five seconds a child dies of hunger around the
world - so for the next 4 minutes and 30 seconds of this video, 52
children would have passed away. Imagine if these were our children? I believe
that we can bring these statistics down together by realising the impact that
our voices can have, united. </p>
<p>My name is Nez Erok, and I am a
singer/songwriter, and an advocate for women and children. Mid last year the continual attacks of the wars
happening around the world baffled me. I kept asking myself that in 2014, how
was this still happening? Were we just desensitised as a human race? I thought
that this issue needed to be one of the most important matters for every
government and every person who valued their freedom. It is heart wrenching
that these people and children are being denied their basic human rights. I felt that I needed to add my
voice, and that we needed everyone to add their voices so that together we
could stand as one big voice!</p>
<p>Being a mother also, how could I only care about my own
backyard and playground? Questions like, “why can’t we see beyond
this”, and “what would happen if we all realised that these families in
war zones were mothers that also loved their children as much as we did?” but
they were victims of circumstance, and that they just didn't have the same
freedoms, liberties and abilities to enact change the way that we did. These
victims just do not have the ability to help
themselves, and once we shake off this idea that this is just “how it is”, I
believe that we can join together and actively make a difference in their
lives. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>My campaign is about creating
awareness around the disasters our global wars are having on our children.
 This campaign is so important to me because half of the proceeds I raise
will be going to charity to help with the aftermath of this conflict, and
the other half raised will be going to fund my music video ""Laid to
Rest"". </p>
<p>Proceeds that go to charity
organisations like the ones listed below will help support and rehabilitate
child victims of war. They will aid in helping victims deal with the lasting
consequences of conflict on children. Charity organisations can work with local
communities, their organisations and local authorities in both conflict and
post-conflict areas to support children and the people they depend upon. They
act in ensuring sustainable security for children, and promoting child
supportive livelihood opportunities. Such organisations address the
developmental needs of the most vulnerable and marginalised children.
Basically, your money will go a long way!</p>
<p>The music video “Laid to Rest”
features children living in countries suffering from unrest due to war,
especially the Middle East and Africa. This concept of 'betterment
for all' is a centrepiece for what this song will bring to the world. It is a
video that I hope will create awareness and change. I hope that when people
watch this video and hear the words of this song that they are moved enough to
make a stand.  Making a difference doesn't mean that we necessarily have
to travel to Africa or Afghanistan, it can be as small as signing a petition,
joining a rally, or donating the amount that you would spend on a cup of coffee
to an organisation that can help. I think that the saddest thing is
that we all know about what is happening, but we don't realise that we can make
a difference today!</p>
<p>What I Need &amp; What You Get</p>

<li>I need $10,000 AUD to help me finish the music
     video for Laid To Rest, and also to cover costs for mastering, mixing and
     distribution. This will also be enough to help me finish my EP. </li>
<li>I would love to raise another $10,000 to donate
     to charity organisations around the world that are dedicated to helping
     children affected by war. Even if I cannot raise $20,000 in total, half of
     <b><u>everything</u></b> that I raise

Video produced by Ross Metcalf.
