<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The main technical and economic parameters</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Projects preconditions</h3>
<p>At present time regular service between Pesochin and Kharkov is organized using fixed-route buses and suburban trains. It is possible to get to station «Holodna Gora» (near subway station «Holodna Gora») in Kharkov by bus from Pesochin, and to Kharkov’s railway station by suburban train. Besides destination time by bus is about from 20 to 80 minutes, which depends from traffic workload. Destination time by train is about 30 minutes.</p>
<h3>Proposed solution</h3>
<p>By creating SkyWay transport system from Kharkov subway station to Pesochin will solve traffic problem. Also it is planned to create high-speed station in Pesochin combined with multifunctional center (sales outlet, restaurants, business center, medical facilities etc.). We assume significant growth in passenger flow after commissioning high-speed route and multifunctional center combined with station.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497881003/ln6jt6nh36whc0rzlk9t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Img. 1. </i><i>The station at the entrance to Kharkov.​</i></p>
<h3>Traffic stream analyse</h3>
<p>According to our estimates today passenger flow on route «Pesochin – Holodnogorskaya» can reach up to 10 thousand passengers per day (assuming, that people would travel to Kharkov and back to work and study). In perspective, as commissioning multifunctional station with entertainment and medical facilities pasenger flow will rise at least up to 20 thousand passengers per day (it would happen in 2 or 3 years after route commissioning). In addition, fare could be set 0,5 USD (destination time 5 minutes), while public transport fare at this route costs 5–6 hryvnia (0,19-0,23 USD, but destination time from 20 to 80 minutes). In this case, passengers will be willing to pay higher prices for travel in view of the fact that they will spend on the road several times less time.</p>

</tbody></table><p> </p><h3>The economic effect of the project</h3><p>Building urban route from Pesochin to ""Holodnogorskaya"" station will significantly improve the quality of transportation between Pesochin and Kharkov and reduce villagers time losses (including the owners of new housing). Project payback around 10 years. <strong>Thus in 50 years of operation SkyWay transport system (by transportation 7.3 million passengers per year), the economic effect will be about 131 million USD for the cost of the track is about 26 million USD. </strong>The effect is calculated on the basis of income per passenger in the amount of 0,36 USD (if the passenger fare cost 0.14 USD and the price of USD 0,5 ticket): 0,36 USD / pass. x 3650000 pass. / year x 50 years = 131 400 000 USD. In addition, it should be noted that since the introduction of high-speed route on the Dnieper, Kiev and Sumy and multifunctional station on the adjacent land route return on investment will improve significantly and will not exceed 4-5 years (even more low fare). The presented calculations are preliminary and do not take into account the peculiarities of local expenditures for a variety of permits for construction, diversion, receipt of land, environmental services expertise, land surveyors, workstations projects as isolation units, electrical examinations, obtain technical 5 conditions, topographical surveys, transfer and extension utilities, local contributions to the infrastructure development areas etc., which affects the specific amount of the cost and the associated expenditure are direct, without which it is impossible to put into operation the aerial transport route of the second level with stations as interchange nodes.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497883783/lqlusvf0tzpb4vjbfgen.jpg"" src=""""/></p><hr/><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>TERMS OF PARTICIPATION</strong></h2><p>Our team offers an innovative transport technology of elevated type SKY WAY and would like to implement it in Ukraine as a pilot project of an urban transport system.

Projects preconditions
At present time regular service between Pesochin and Kharkov is organized using fixed-route buses and suburban trains. It is possible to get to station «Holodna Gora» (near subway station «Holodna Gora») in Kharkov by bus from Pesochin, and to Kharkov’s railway station by suburban train. Besides destination time by bus is about from 20 to 80 minutes, which depends from traffic workload. Destination time by train is about 30 minutes.
Proposed solution
By creating SkyWay transport system from Kharkov subway station to Pesochin will solve traffic problem. Also it is planned to create high-speed station in Pesochin combined with multifunctional center (sales outlet, restaurants, business center, medical facilities etc.). We assume significant growth in passenger flow after commissioning high-speed route and multifunctional center combined with station.

Img. 1. The station at the entrance to Kharkov.​
Traffic stream analyse
According to our estimates today passenger flow on route «Pesochin – Holodnogorskaya» can reach up to 10 thousand passengers per day (assuming, that people would travel to Kharkov and back to work and study). In perspective, as commissioning multifunctional station with entertainment and medical facilities pasenger flow will rise at least up to 20 thousand passengers per day (it would happen in 2 or 3 years after route commissioning). In addition, fare could be set 0,5 USD (destination time 5 minutes), while public transport fare at this route costs 5–6 hryvnia (0,19-0,23 USD, but destination time from 20 to 80 minutes). In this case, passengers will be willing to pay higher prices for travel in view of the fact that they will spend on the road several times less time.

Img. 2. Estimated highway route «Pesochin – Holodnogorskaya»
Route’s main technical parametres
Main technical parametres is shown in the following table: 


Main technical parametres
Values


1. Route length
7,25 km


2. Average passenger traffic per year (after the exit of the complex at full capacity)
7 300 000 people


3. Maximum speed
up to 150 km/h


4. The number of anchor track supports
5 pcs


5. The number of intermediate track supports
144 pcs

 Ecological compatibilityAccommodation multifunctional route SkyWay above the ground on poles allows you to save the existing building and the infrastructure of the city and the village Pesochin. In addition, the use of SkyWay technologies will improve the ecological compatibility in the city, to avoid noise effects and harmful emissions 4 into the environment through the use of electric motors, patented inventions and know-how.Capital expenditureThe estimated capital expenditure will amount to 26.3 million USD. Cost element structure is shown in the following table:

 The economic effect of the projectBuilding urban route from Pesochin to ""Holodnogorskaya"" station will significantly improve the quality of transportation between Pesochin and Kharkov and reduce villagers time losses (including the owners of new housing). Project payback around 10 years. Thus in 50 years of operation SkyWay transport system (by transportation 7.3 million passengers per year), the economic effect will be about 131 million USD for the cost of the track is about 26 million USD. The effect is calculated on the basis of income per passenger in the amount of 0,36 USD (if the passenger fare cost 0.14 USD and the price of USD 0,5 ticket): 0,36 USD / pass. x 3650000 pass. / year x 50 years = 131 400 000 USD. In addition, it should be noted that since the introduction of high-speed route on the Dnieper, Kiev and Sumy and multifunctional station on the adjacent land route return on investment will improve significantly and will not exceed 4-5 years (even more low fare). The presented calculations are preliminary and do not take into account the peculiarities of local expenditures for a variety of permits for construction, diversion, receipt of land, environmental services expertise, land surveyors, workstations projects as isolation units, electrical examinations, obtain technical 5 conditions, topographical surveys, transfer and extension utilities, local contributions to the infrastructure development areas etc., which affects the specific amount of the cost and the associated expenditure are direct, without which it is impossible to put into operation the aerial transport route of the second level with stations as interchange nodes.TERMS OF PARTICIPATIONOur team offers an innovative transport technology of elevated type SKY WAY and would like to implement it in Ukraine as a pilot project of an urban transport system. The project is expected to be implemented by the team, made up of private individuals and legal entities, residents of USA, Ukraine.At Indiegogo platform, we are represented by a legal entity, the resident of USA, CRYSTAL CORE LTD.According to a number of international experts, SKY WAY transport system is the most economically efficient, eco-friendly and safe, compared to all existing and perspective transport systems.Our project is implementation of new transport technology, the Road of elevated type, based on SkyWay technology, and we would like to start implementation of this technology in Ukraine with a small pilot project – construction of a 7.5 km long transport line of elevated type in Kharkov region, which will connect the suburb of Kharkov – the urban-type settlement of Pesochin with the city, thus making transportation between them comfortable.This little project will show important aspects of preparing documents, harmonization, research work in the area of hub station placement, as well as at the stages of pre-engineering, planning and surveying activities and other complicated operations. Also, we would like to launch rolling stock production within this project and realize other approaches to implementation of the innovative transport technology, including document harmonization at different stages until the project starts operating.In order to start implementation of this project, attract and interest major institutions, including finance ones, we need to prepare documents that include researches, analysis, business plan, its conceptual study of technical and economic background as it allows to save 20-25% of construction cost in future, prepare sketch designs of stations, analyze legal situation with providing land for stations, intermediate supports and performing a number of other organizational, legal and management procedures.At preparatory phase we need to raise up to $415,000. In case of other sum is collected, we will take to consideration possibility of working with separate documents and taking actions using this money to promote the project.The money preparatory phase is required for:
Presentation materials for the pilot project: videos, brochures, posters and other supplementary materials – $15,000.
Development of an avant-project, station concepts, sketch designs of the stations – $250,000.
Analysis of legal situation with providing land and buildings on the selected – $80,000.
Preparing and drafting documents for applying for land (two administrative centres are engaged, and, accordingly, institutions of two administrative units) – $70,000.
The need in money is approximate, but real. Preliminary negotiations have been already held. We can move to the next stages if we raise the money and pay for all documents.The project itself is planned to start operating in summer of 2018, while the time before the planned launch should be used for profound preparation work, including all proceedings of the preparatory phase, mentioned above.The participants, who have joined the project, have preference in participation in the project as a whole with the right for repurchase of their share by the participants of the second level at the coefficient 1.5-3 from the invested sum, depending on payback term and issuing a certificate, which gives the right of direct participation in the project.If you invest money to participate in the project, it means you are a participant of the first level.

</p><p><b>At  EcoReco, </b>we would like to preserve the environment in a cool and fun way.<br/><br/>

We believe that rather than inheriting the planet from our ancestors, 
our generation is just temporarily borrowing it from future generations.
 Therefore, we promote acts of “green”-ness not due to the pursuing of 
self-importance but because it is the right and responsible thing to do.<br/><br/>

Our mission at EcoReco is to provide eco-friendly alternatives to 
today’s energy-depleting, environment-threatening norms. We don’t want 
to accomplish the mission relying on charities or government subsides. 
We wish to build a self-sustainable business such that future 
entrepreneurs can be inspired and not afraid of joining the cause.<br/><br/>

We put our efforts to innovate, to develop, and to source the brightest 
ideas from around the world, and we also try to build the right business
 models to bring them directly to the end users. We work hard to make 
sure our products are both practical and affordable.<br/><br/>

Take the EcoReco electric scooter as an example:<br/><br/>

A national household travel survey shows 50% of American car drivers’ 
daily trips are 3 miles or less, but most still choose to drive alone 
for them (even in an SUV!!). We propose an eco-friendly, efficient, and 
compact solution in the e-scooter. Not only can it do the job in these 
situations but also it’s much cheaper, faster and more fun for you, and 
less traffic congestion, pollution and CO2 emissions for all. With the 
energy, time, parking fee savings and its low price tag, the scooter 
practically pays for itself with just few months’ usage.<br/><br/>

We’ll always advocate the use of e-scooters, whether you choose one of 
our state-of-the-art models or a product from a competitor. That’s 
because we’ve realized—and we hope you will, too—that along with saving a
 lot of green (both for the environment and for your wallet), riding an 
e-scooter will bring smiles to your face and to those of future 
generations.<br/><br/>

THAT is our mission at EcoReco and we are driven to deliver that to you.

 models to bring them directly to the end users. We work hard to make 
sure our products are both practical and affordable.

Take the EcoReco electric scooter as an example:

A national household travel survey shows 50% of American car drivers’ 
daily trips are 3 miles or less, but most still choose to drive alone 
for them (even in an SUV!!). We propose an eco-friendly, efficient, and 
compact solution in the e-scooter. Not only can it do the job in these 
situations but also it’s much cheaper, faster and more fun for you, and 
less traffic congestion, pollution and CO2 emissions for all. With the 
energy, time, parking fee savings and its low price tag, the scooter 
practically pays for itself with just few months’ usage.

We’ll always advocate the use of e-scooters, whether you choose one of 
our state-of-the-art models or a product from a competitor. That’s 
because we’ve realized—and we hope you will, too—that along with saving a
 lot of green (both for the environment and for your wallet), riding an 
e-scooter will bring smiles to your face and to those of future 
generations.

THAT is our mission at EcoReco and we are driven to deliver that to you.

</div></div>","It happens all the time, right?  The weather is beautiful, you and your Jeep are ready to explore the great outdoors, and it never fails - you take the top off... and it rains!  One thing Jeep lovers know all too well is that when you take your top off, you are making a commitment.  Maybe there's going to be rain in the next few days, maybe it's going to end up being a lot hotter than expected.  Either way, you are either stuck with the top off, or stuck putting a whole lot of time AND energy to put the top back on.   With Trac-Top, you get the best of both worlds. Our patented design is simple: in a single motion, you can engage or disengage the top, retracting from the drivers seat or from the passenger seats. However much sun or shade you want is totally up to you. Everything installs using stock hardware and mounts, and you get protection from almost anything nature throws at you. Fire-resistant, non-toxic, and tear-resistant, the material used to create Trac-Top; will keep your seats dry and cool while still allowing you to enjoy nature.
          

Right now, we need your help.  We are looking to raise $50,000. These funds will cover the costs of expanding the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution processes behind Trac-Top. As a thank-you, we are offering a number of perks for the trails or the garage, along with Trac-Top at a major discount to you, our valued contributors.
 


When you are creating something that people will be using in conjunction with their vehicles, you need to be sure that everything works exactly as intended. We have gone to extreme lengths in order to ensure the safety of Trac-Top. We have the utmost confidence in its design and in our manufacturing team. You can rest assure that any challenges that may arise between now and the time that we deliver Trac-Top to you, we will be sure to face them intelligently and boldly.


In addition to contributing monetarily, you can help out by sharing our campaign with trail buddies and your local Jeep groups. Go ahead and post the campaign link on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and any other social media platforms you use! The more people that are aware of what we are doing with Trac-Top, the smoother the next few months will go for us. We appreciate your contributions, monetary and non-monetary, and thank you for your time.

smoothly in a wide range of speeds of above 160 km/h (100mph)! The
flight endurance of this drone is remarkably long. You will have the
opportunity to fly with him about 5-15 hours! You do not have an UAV with
similar performances? Now you have them on hand!</p><p><br/></p>
<h4><b>About
this project</b></h4>
<span><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>Best selling Christmas present was a drone. Most searched word on Google was ""drone"". It seems that in the future, drones will be all around us. So a lot of people looking for a drone. Some for fun, some for work. But what they find? The vast majority of them are multi-rotor copters. Or not? Yes! The vast majority of them are bees that hover in the air, but do not fly. They are hovering in the air for 15-20 minutes and then fall to the ground as dead flies. </p>
<p>Hovering above the target is one problem, but if you need to track it, then you need two things. You need speed and endurance. </p>
<p></p></span>
<p>In
addition, most of these ""toys"" they have no idea where they are in
space and how high above the surrounding terrain, as they have only the data
from the GPS. The problem with the
detection of height by GPS is long known, but still  most drones today does not have an altimeter
(pressure or laser) or backup inertial navigation system.</p>
<p>That's why we launched this project with working name MP-1A  STORK.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1211447/files/20150210072258-MP-1A_system_model_03B_3D_19_s_logem.jpg?1423581778"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<h4><b>Flight range and flight time</b></h4>
<p></p><p>Endurance<span> isn't
normally associated with most of the drones out there. We changed that! The
flight time of out drone is depended on the flight profile. You will be able to
fly about 5 hours in horizontal flight at speed Vh=160 km/h (100 mph). In this
case, the motor run continuously on a low power.</span></p>
<p><span>However,
if you need even higher endurance, you can then use a saw flight profile. In
this case, the drone will be glide at speed Vopt=80 km/h (50 mph) for 23 sec.
Then the motor will be running for a period of 1-2 seconds at maximum power for
climbing back to the altitude, where gliding was initiated.</span></p><p><br/></p>
<h4><b>Speed</b></h4>
<p>Speed isn't normally associated with most of
the drones out there.  We changed
that!  Ever heard of a multi-rotor taking
great aerial shots at 160 km/h (100 mph)?  Well,
now you have it on hand!</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>A Redefined Drone</b></h4>
<p></p><p>The MP-1A STORK
is not just a watchdog constantly monitoring a large area. Of course it can be
used as search robot looking for people during rescue operations. It may also
be used for monitoring the movement of animals in large areas, or tracking
poachers killing the rhino, or other protected animals. Can autonomously fly
near the beaches and to check the presence of sharks. You can use it as a tool
for scaring the starlings who destroys crops.</p>
<p>Do you want to
shoot video of the airplane flying low over the surface of the Lake around a
small island? It should not be a problem. The aircraft can be equipped with an
auxiliary universal curtain that is before landing plugs into a large section
of the hull. On this hinge would be able to consolidate a stabilized gimbal
with the popular GoPro camera. There are still options to modify these things,
it's up for debate.</p>

All of this is accomplished
with our fast and persistent civil drone.<br/><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Easy to Fly</b></h4>
<p>During our test-fly programs an autopilot will
be tuned up, so the drone won't be able to fall by itself into uncontrolled
spin. If the drone fall into a spin during the manual flight , the autopilot
will be able to make correction manoeuvr himself and bring the drone to a steady horizontal
flight.<br/></p><p><br/></p><h4>
<b>How it Looks / How it </b><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">Works</b>

designed as a single-engine multipurpose aircraft made from high modulus (HM)
carbon fiber prepreg (CFRP). It is equipped with a three-well retractable
landing gear. On this airplane can be installed a wide variety of sensors. In
small surfaces on the tip of the fuselage is integrated a pair of cameras used
for stereo-vision system to detect obstacles. The next planned equipment is a
laser radar (LIDAR) for detection of obstacles under poor Visual conditions. This
radar is in the landing configuration hidden in the fuselage and into the
working position is ejected after take-off the aircraft. In the front part of
the hull in the dome is designed to install two cameras (RGB, IR) with high
resolution. The camera module is hidden in the landing configuration in the
fuselage and into the working position is ejected after take-off the aircraft.<b> </b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><div>

<p><b>Safe</b>: With GPS and Inertial Navigation
System as a backup of GPS the drone will always known a shortest flight
trajectory to the ground control station (GCS), so in case of low energy in
battery they can safely fly back to home. Computer Stereo-vision system
combined with the Laser Radar (LIDAR) in case of poor visual conditions send a
warning to the GCS if there is a obstacle on trajectory of flight in time , or
may make a evasive manoeuvre himself without assistance. All data from all
sensors will be recorded on the microSD card and in real time will be send over
Multi-way data lines to the ground control station. As well as video from the cameras can be
transmitted over the wireless network.</p><p><br/></p>

About
this project

Best selling Christmas present was a drone. Most searched word on Google was ""drone"". It seems that in the future, drones will be all around us. So a lot of people looking for a drone. Some for fun, some for work. But what they find? The vast majority of them are multi-rotor copters. Or not? Yes! The vast majority of them are bees that hover in the air, but do not fly. They are hovering in the air for 15-20 minutes and then fall to the ground as dead flies. 
Hovering above the target is one problem, but if you need to track it, then you need two things. You need speed and endurance. 

In
addition, most of these ""toys"" they have no idea where they are in
space and how high above the surrounding terrain, as they have only the data
from the GPS. The problem with the
detection of height by GPS is long known, but still  most drones today does not have an altimeter
(pressure or laser) or backup inertial navigation system.
That's why we launched this project with working name MP-1A  STORK.
Flight range and flight time
Endurance isn't
normally associated with most of the drones out there. We changed that! The
flight time of out drone is depended on the flight profile. You will be able to
fly about 5 hours in horizontal flight at speed Vh=160 km/h (100 mph). In this
case, the motor run continuously on a low power.
However,
if you need even higher endurance, you can then use a saw flight profile. In
this case, the drone will be glide at speed Vopt=80 km/h (50 mph) for 23 sec.
Then the motor will be running for a period of 1-2 seconds at maximum power for
climbing back to the altitude, where gliding was initiated.
Speed
Speed isn't normally associated with most of
the drones out there.  We changed
that!  Ever heard of a multi-rotor taking
great aerial shots at 160 km/h (100 mph)?  Well,
now you have it on hand!

A Redefined Drone
The MP-1A STORK
is not just a watchdog constantly monitoring a large area. Of course it can be
used as search robot looking for people during rescue operations. It may also
be used for monitoring the movement of animals in large areas, or tracking
poachers killing the rhino, or other protected animals. Can autonomously fly
near the beaches and to check the presence of sharks. You can use it as a tool
for scaring the starlings who destroys crops.
Do you want to
shoot video of the airplane flying low over the surface of the Lake around a
small island? It should not be a problem. The aircraft can be equipped with an
auxiliary universal curtain that is before landing plugs into a large section
of the hull. On this hinge would be able to consolidate a stabilized gimbal
with the popular GoPro camera. There are still options to modify these things,
it's up for debate.

All of this is accomplished
with our fast and persistent civil drone.

Easy to Fly
During our test-fly programs an autopilot will
be tuned up, so the drone won't be able to fall by itself into uncontrolled
spin. If the drone fall into a spin during the manual flight , the autopilot
will be able to make correction manoeuvr himself and bring the drone to a steady horizontal
flight.
How it Looks / How it Works
MP-1A STORK is
designed as a single-engine multipurpose aircraft made from high modulus (HM)
carbon fiber prepreg (CFRP). It is equipped with a three-well retractable
landing gear. On this airplane can be installed a wide variety of sensors. In
small surfaces on the tip of the fuselage is integrated a pair of cameras used
for stereo-vision system to detect obstacles. The next planned equipment is a
laser radar (LIDAR) for detection of obstacles under poor Visual conditions. This
radar is in the landing configuration hidden in the fuselage and into the
working position is ejected after take-off the aircraft. In the front part of
the hull in the dome is designed to install two cameras (RGB, IR) with high
resolution. The camera module is hidden in the landing configuration in the
fuselage and into the working position is ejected after take-off the aircraft. 








Key Features
An Endurance worker: Need to fly long, far and away? Need to repetitively fly over a wide
area like farms, beaches, vineyards? Need to fly above lake to film a small
isle at the lake centre? Need to track a poacher? That's no problem, 5-15 hours of flying time
will be available (depends on the flight profile and takeoff weight).A Speed record man: Need to follow a fast moving object or want some
fast relocation of the drone? Based on the situation you may fly with speeds
about 160 km/h (86kn ; 100 mph) in horizontal flight and about 200 km/h (108 kn
; 124 mph) in dive flight - this is limiting speed used in design. None: we
known that some special RC aircrafts are very fast and flying over 400 km/h
(116 kn ; 248 mph), but they are limited for operation within special areas at
RC club airports. For example here at ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyRQ65pDmW0""
is really shown a flying weapon.
Easy to fly: Stabilized
during entire flight profile in takeoff, climb, cruise, manoeuvring and landing.
During our test-fly programs an autopilot will be tuned up, so the drone won't
be able to fall into uncontrolled spin, for example.
Safe: With GPS and Inertial Navigation
System as a backup of GPS the drone will always known a shortest flight
trajectory to the ground control station (GCS), so in case of low energy in
battery they can safely fly back to home. Computer Stereo-vision system
combined with the Laser Radar (LIDAR) in case of poor visual conditions send a

may make a evasive manoeuvre himself without assistance. All data from all
sensors will be recorded on the microSD card and in real time will be send over
Multi-way data lines to the ground control station. As well as video from the cameras can be
transmitted over the wireless network.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span>The main goal of this project was to produce the most secure bicycle system ever created without affecting the integrity of the frame itself. We realized that performance and comfort can be achieved together which is why the beauty of Yerka’s design is in its simplicity. By thinking out of the box we came up with a concept that merges everything into one sleek design. And we couldn’t be more excited!</span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1288433/files/20150311202832-YERKA.png?1426130912"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span>As Engineering students we acquired all of the skills and knowledge necessary to bring this project to life.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">From a young age our whole team always had great interests in robotics, design, and technology; always creating and testing and finding solutions--constantly wanting to do more. All of this prepared us for the complicated task at hand which required advanced knowledge of sophisticated laser cutting and lathe machines, 3D Printers, metal work, and welding.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span>Our hard work and life-long passion, along with the collaboration with accelerator institutes (<a href=""http://www.garageuai.cl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Garage UAI</a>, <a href=""http://www.chrysalis.cl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>CHRYSALIS</a>) paid off; we won the PRECITYE contest (Regional Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme in Engineering), an OTT contest (Technology Transfer Office) at our University (<a href=""http://www.uai.cl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">UAI</a>), and were finalists in the last Junior World Entrepreneurship Forum hosted in Santiago, Chile. Today, we are very proud to have won a Chilean Seed Capital from (<a href=""http://www.uai.cl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CORFO</a>) </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We’ve since added on to our team and are working with the most accomplished experts out there, like Mikaela, one of the finest 3D Designers in the world; and Cristián Haquin, a serial entrepreneur, bluetooth developing expert, excellent solution provider, and Co- Founder of Azumi Mobile Phone Company.</p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><br/></div>

<div style=""text-align: left;"">We are a motivated team who has decided to take this challenge and give you only our best!</div></span></span></span></span></div>

<span>FAQ</span>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How can I pay for my YERKA®?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">You can use your credit card. Here is a link with further information, but remember, we are currently not accepting paypal. <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/202544513-Payment-Types"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles...</a></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How does the USD $99 coupon works?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">By reserving now at just USD $99 we will grant you a point price at USD $499. Pay the remaining USD $400 balance in advance of delivery. </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p><b>Will my <b>YERKA® be compatible with grills and baskets</b>?</b></p>
<p>Of course it will! The YERKA® has the mounts to them, so feel free to add them on your own.</p>
<br/>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Can the wheels be taken away by thieves?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We got that cover! We have designed a special nut security system to protect the wheels. The only way to get them out is with a special key, which only you have. This way, your whole bike is secured.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>What if I cut the seat tube and replace it with another?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our mechanism works in such way that if someone were to cut the tube, the whole bicycle wouldn’t close to it’s original shape. Doing this renders the bike useless, so replacing the broken seat tube for another wouldn’t solve anything.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Is there another way to secure the mechanism or a key is the only way?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In the beginning and for the most basic models, yes. Although, we are working in a bluetooth locking mechanism, leaving the key in the past and maximising your comfort while riding. </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>What happens if I want to change any part of my YERKA?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Easy, it’s just like any other bike. If you want to replace any component of your YERKA, like wheels, brakes, pedals, etc… feel free to do it. You can buy any aftermarket products to easily modify it for best suiting you.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>To which places can I secure my YERKA?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">You can secure it to any kind of poles, fences, traditional or inverted U bike racks, etc, up to 20,3 cm (8 inches). Get creative, this are only suggestions, there are many other places where you can secure it and we encourage you to tell us about your favourite. </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Will it be available in different sizes?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Of course it will! Sizes available are Small, Medium, Large and X-Large, all of them available to pick at the end of the campaign.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How much will the shipping cost?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If you are within the USA or Chile your YERKA will arrive with no extra charges! If you are outside, the shipping cost will no more than USD $150. We will update shipping information at the end of the campaign, however – with the USD $150 – it’s a cap. The more we sell the lower this figure will become, it will not go up. There is no need to pay for shipping now, we will update you on this with more accurate estimates based on volume. We'll send you a reminder about shipping cost before the end of the campaign, at which point we'll present you with an option to pay the cost.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How do I choose the color of the YERKA®?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">By voting on your favourite color you can make it available for choosing. At the end of the campaign we will contact you by mail and ask you to pick your desired color and size of your YERKA.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>What material is it made of? Is it heavy?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The whole frame of the YERKA is made out of steel, and the whole system is made of the best quality hardened aluminium. The YERKA weights 11,5 kilos (25 pounds), making it lighter than a traditional fixie bike with a strong lock.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Is the YERKA® compatible with gears?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Yes it is! With the option of buying only the YERKA frame, we’re giving you the possibility to use the gears you like using a mass with internal gears. </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Can I use it on the mountains?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Sadly we haven’t developed a YERKA mountain bike… yet. For now you can comfortably use it as a bike for your daily commute, friendly trips, or riding the city. </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Why do you call it ‘unstealable’?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">By using the frame as the lock, breaking the lock implies breaking the structure of the bike. Even a dumb thief can reckon that it is not a good idea. By breaking the lock you break the bike, making it no longer a bicycle. If by any chance the thief breaks the pole, fence, or bike rack your YERKA was secured to, he won’t be able to ride it. The frame is still in its locking position, which makes it impossible to ride.That’s why we call it ‘unstealable’.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Is the system by any chance demountable?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Yes and no. To detach the pivots you need a special tool to take the crossed security screw out, a tool owned by us. Without the tool you would have to cut the frame and we’re back to having a useless bicycle. </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How is the YERKA® built?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The YERKA is manufactured using almost all existing parts, lowering the cost but not the quality. The locking mechanism is made using the best materials possible to ensure the quality and lifespan. </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How does the bluetooth connection work?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">By connecting your smartphone (iOS or Android) to the YERKA® and downloading the app you are good to go! Any device with Bluetooth 4.0 or above is compatible.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>Is there any YERKA® authorised dealer?</b></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">Eventually there will be, and we hope many. In the meantime for any inquiry you can contact us at info@yerkaproject.com</div></span></span></span></span></div>

<h1><b><span>LO QUE DIFERENCIA A YERKA®</span></b></h1>
<div>El objetivo de este proyecto es producir el mejor sistema de seguridad para bicicletas. Nos dimos cuenta que desempeño y comodidad pueden ser logrados juntos, y es en esto que radica la belleza del diseño de YERKA®, en su simplicidad. Pensando fuera de la caja, logramos un concepto que combina todo dentro de un diseño sobrio. No podríamos estar más emocionados!<br/>

<p>Como estudiantes de Ingeniería, hemos adquirido habilidades y conocimientos importantes para llevar a cabo este proyecto. Desde pequeños siempre estuvimos interesados en la robótica, el diseño y en siempre querer hacer más. Todo esto ayudó a que hoy pudiésemos usar increíbles herramientas como cortadoras laser, impresoras 3D, tornos para mecanizado de piezas e incluso soldar.</p>
<p>Ganamos el concurso de PRECITYE (Programa Regional de Emprendedorismo e Innovación en Ingeniería), además un concurso de la OTT (Oficina de Transferencia Tecnológica) de nuestra Universidad, y fuimos finalistas en el JWEF (Foro Mundial del Emprendimiento Juvenil) realizado en Santiago de Chile. <span> Y ahora estamos muy orgullosos de haber ganado un capital semilla de <a href=""http://www.corfo.cl/inicio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CORFO</a>.</span></p>
<p>Para potenciar aún más nuestro equipo estamos trabajando con distintos profesionales dando el máximo en sus áreas, como Mikaela, una de las mejores diseñadoras 3D; Cristián Haquin, emprendedor serial, experto desarrollador en bluetooth, y Co- Fundador de la compañía de teléfonos movil, Azumi.</p>
<br/>Estamos dedicando todos nuestros esfuerzos para entregarte sólo lo mejor, y siempre estamos buscando gente motivada. Es por esto que te queremos a TÍ dentro de este viaje.<p></p>

<h1><b>RIESGOS Y DESAFÍOS</b></h1>
<h1></h1>
<p>Sabemos que la buena calidad cuesta, pero en nuestros pilares esta entregarte una bicicleta de la mejor calidad. Es por esto que viajaremos a Shenzhen, China, para asegurarnos de que los mejores materiales están siendo utilizados en tu YERKA.</p>
<p>El desarrollo de la tecnología Bluetooth, para desbloquear el seguro de la YERKA®, no es sencillo de desarrollar, es por esto que estamos trabajando con un experto con años de prueba y error en la materia.</p>
<p>Somos un equipo motivado que ha decidido tomar este desafío y entregar lo mejor de sí!</p>

<h1><b>PREGUNTAS FRECUENTES</b></h1>
<br/><p><span><b>¿Cómo puedo pagar mi YERKA®?</b></span></p>
<p>Puedes usar tu tarjeta de crédito. Aquí hay un link con mayor información, pero recuerda que actualmente no estamos aceptando PayPal. <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/202544513-Payment-Types"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles...</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>¿Cómo funciona el cupón de USD $99?</b></p>
<p>Al comprar el cupón estás reservando el precio promocional de USD $499 para cuando saquemos el producto físico a la venta. Es decir, solo pagarás USD $400 por tu YERKA®, una fracción del precio final.</p>

Introducing a bicycle locking system designed to keep you feeling safe.We went back to the roots of security and made a paradigm shift: “Make a lock out of the bike”. Now a thief would have to cut through the main structure to take the bicycle, defeating the purpose. Not only can you relax knowing your bike is secure, the quality and design of YERKA are unmatched.

WHAT THE PRESS IS SAYING




















WHAT MAKES YERKA DIFFERENT

The main goal of this project was to produce the most secure bicycle system ever created without affecting the integrity of the frame itself. We realized that performance and comfort can be achieved together which is why the beauty of Yerka’s design is in its simplicity. By thinking out of the box we came up with a concept that merges everything into one sleek design. And we couldn’t be more excited!





1. SAFETY








YERKA LOCKING TECHNOLOGY



The Yerka Locking Technology features (same as Kryptonite locks): 

12mm hardened steel shackle resist hand tools
Reinforced collar over keyway for increased protection
High security disc-style cylinder


Yerka Anti-Theft Nut


With special anti-theft nuts on the wheels, that only you have the special key for them, so no one can take them but you. Now you can park your bike anywhere comfortably knowing all its parts will be waiting for you right where you left them.





BLUETOOTH: A KEYLESS FUTURE







Now you can leave it parked outside and still find it where you left it!









2. DESIGN

The YERKA design can be applied to any classical frame shape. Unlike foldable or rental bikes, YERKA has a sleek design. The lock is so seamless and integrated we’ll bet no one can tell the difference between YERKA and a classical bike! 












3. EASE OF USE/COMFORT



Securing your YERKA can be as fast as tying your shoelaces! Just 10 seconds and you are good to go!










PERKS





Update: All perks are sold out, but you can still donate and help us make our dream come true!
This campaign is aimed to give you the most secure bike ever, and also to give you some great perks! If you believe in our project, you can donate more than the perk itself. For example: USD $50 for an Eba Bike designed T-Shirt, or USD $350 for the frame alone. It is not an obligation by any means, but it will be highly appreciated and will also help lower shipping costs.






* You can choose your size/ color for the YERKA Bike, YERKA Frame and T-Shirt when the campaign ends. We will contact you vía e-mail. 

** The Yerka Frame includes Fork + Seat Post + Yerka Anti-Theft Nuts. Does not include a Seat.  







Coupons: Don’t have the money? Don´t worry!

We know that USD $449 may be a lot to spend at once, so for just USD $99 we will grant you a USD $499 price even for when the campaign is over. Just pay the remaining USD $400 balance in advance of delivery to get your Yerka (you can pay this remaining till end September and get it by November 2015) . The estimated market retail price is USD $600+.

ROADMAP

Finding a great manufacturer is hard, and we don’t want to trade quality for quick and cheap production. Thinking towards quality, for every 1000 YERKA units sold, we will deliver them in batches with a month of separation, the first one starts shipping in October.


WHY WE NEED YOU
We have come to Indiegogo to share our project with all of you, our incredible community of bicycle supporters. You deserve a better locking mechanism to secure your bike when you’re not around to watch it We want you to feel and be safe. We also want to hear and learn from you--your suggestions and feedback will not only help us improve our project, but will also be implemented into our rewards and further bicycle designs. We know this is an ambitious project, but we are certain that with your help YERKA will become a worldwide reality.





A GREAT TEAM

Most people learn to walk before they run... we learned to ride before we walked! We have a deep love for the cycling, and we also know what it feels like to lose a bike to theft. We are three engineering students who had enough of getting our bicycles stolen and wanted to create a solution. 




For us, Indiegogo is not just a way to get this thrilling project to you, it is a way to hear from and learn from you. With your help and support we know we can get this to the whole world.

As Engineering students we acquired all of the skills and knowledge necessary to bring this project to life.
From a young age our whole team always had great interests in robotics, design, and technology; always creating and testing and finding solutions--constantly wanting to do more. All of this prepared us for the complicated task at hand which required advanced knowledge of sophisticated laser cutting and lathe machines, 3D Printers, metal work, and welding.
Our hard work and life-long passion, along with the collaboration with accelerator institutes (Garage UAI, CHRYSALIS) paid off; we won the PRECITYE contest (Regional Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme in Engineering), an OTT contest (Technology Transfer Office) at our University (UAI), and were finalists in the last Junior World Entrepreneurship Forum hosted in Santiago, Chile. Today, we are very proud to have won a Chilean Seed Capital from (CORFO) 
We’ve since added on to our team and are working with the most accomplished experts out there, like Mikaela, one of the finest 3D Designers in the world; and Cristián Haquin, a serial entrepreneur, bluetooth developing expert, excellent solution provider, and Co- Founder of Azumi Mobile Phone Company.

We are dedicating all our efforts to give you nothing but the best, and are always looking for more motivated people to be part of The Team. Today, we want YOU to join us in this journey.





SHIPPING






RISK & CHALLENGES
We know great quality is hard to find, and with this project we cannot afford having bad quality components. That’s why we are traveling to Shenzhen, China, to ensure only the best materials are being used in our bikes. Developing the awesome bluetooth technology to unlock the YERKA is not easy, that’s why we are working with an expert in the subject, who also is an entrepreneur. 
We are a motivated team who has decided to take this challenge and give you only our best!





FAQ

How can I pay for my YERKA®?
You can use your credit card. Here is a link with further information, but remember, we are currently not accepting paypal. https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles...

How does the USD $99 coupon works?
By reserving now at just USD $99 we will grant you a point price at USD $499. Pay the remaining USD $400 balance in advance of delivery. 


Will my YERKA® be compatible with grills and baskets?
Of course it will! The YERKA® has the mounts to them, so feel free to add them on your own.


Can the wheels be taken away by thieves?
We got that cover! We have designed a special nut security system to protect the wheels. The only way to get them out is with a special key, which only you have. This way, your whole bike is secured.

What if I cut the seat tube and replace it with another?
Our mechanism works in such way that if someone were to cut the tube, the whole bicycle wouldn’t close to it’s original shape. Doing this renders the bike useless, so replacing the broken seat tube for another wouldn’t solve anything.

Is there another way to secure the mechanism or a key is the only way?
In the beginning and for the most basic models, yes. Although, we are working in a bluetooth locking mechanism, leaving the key in the past and maximising your comfort while riding. 

What happens if I want to change any part of my YERKA?
Easy, it’s just like any other bike. If you want to replace any component of your YERKA, like wheels, brakes, pedals, etc… feel free to do it. You can buy any aftermarket products to easily modify it for best suiting you.

To which places can I secure my YERKA?
You can secure it to any kind of poles, fences, traditional or inverted U bike racks, etc, up to 20,3 cm (8 inches). Get creative, this are only suggestions, there are many other places where you can secure it and we encourage you to tell us about your favourite. 

Will it be available in different sizes?
Of course it will! Sizes available are Small, Medium, Large and X-Large, all of them available to pick at the end of the campaign.

How much will the shipping cost?
If you are within the USA or Chile your YERKA will arrive with no extra charges! If you are outside, the shipping cost will no more than USD $150. We will update shipping information at the end of the campaign, however – with the USD $150 – it’s a cap. The more we sell the lower this figure will become, it will not go up. There is no need to pay for shipping now, we will update you on this with more accurate estimates based on volume. We'll send you a reminder about shipping cost before the end of the campaign, at which point we'll present you with an option to pay the cost.

How do I choose the color of the YERKA®?
By voting on your favourite color you can make it available for choosing. At the end of the campaign we will contact you by mail and ask you to pick your desired color and size of your YERKA.

What material is it made of? Is it heavy?
The whole frame of the YERKA is made out of steel, and the whole system is made of the best quality hardened aluminium. The YERKA weights 11,5 kilos (25 pounds), making it lighter than a traditional fixie bike with a strong lock.

Is the YERKA® compatible with gears?
Yes it is! With the option of buying only the YERKA frame, we’re giving you the possibility to use the gears you like using a mass with internal gears. 

Can I use it on the mountains?
Sadly we haven’t developed a YERKA mountain bike… yet. For now you can comfortably use it as a bike for your daily commute, friendly trips, or riding the city. 

Why do you call it ‘unstealable’?
By using the frame as the lock, breaking the lock implies breaking the structure of the bike. Even a dumb thief can reckon that it is not a good idea. By breaking the lock you break the bike, making it no longer a bicycle. If by any chance the thief breaks the pole, fence, or bike rack your YERKA was secured to, he won’t be able to ride it. The frame is still in its locking position, which makes it impossible to ride.That’s why we call it ‘unstealable’.

Is the system by any chance demountable?
Yes and no. To detach the pivots you need a special tool to take the crossed security screw out, a tool owned by us. Without the tool you would have to cut the frame and we’re back to having a useless bicycle. 

How is the YERKA® built?
The YERKA is manufactured using almost all existing parts, lowering the cost but not the quality. The locking mechanism is made using the best materials possible to ensure the quality and lifespan. 

How does the bluetooth connection work?
By connecting your smartphone (iOS or Android) to the YERKA® and downloading the app you are good to go! Any device with Bluetooth 4.0 or above is compatible.

Is there any YERKA® authorised dealer?
Eventually there will be, and we hope many. In the meantime for any inquiry you can contact us at info@yerkaproject.com

UN GRAN EQUIPO


Dicen que algunos corren antes de aprender a caminar… nosotros aprendimos a pedalear antes de caminar! Tenemos un profundo amor por las bicicletas, y al igual que tú, sabemos lo que se siente perder una en manos de un ladrón. Somos tres estudiantes de Ingeniería hartos de que nos roben nuestras bicicletas.




La bicicleta es más que simplemente un cuadro, las ruedas y la cadena. La bicicleta es nuestra forma de movernos, de expresarnos. Andar en bicicleta es una experiencia… y creemos que no hay mejor manera de asegurarla que con nuestro innovador diseño. Desarrollar YERKA® ha sido un trabajo de pasión. Para nosotros, Indiegogo no es solamente un medio para mostrarles este emocionante proyecto, es una forma de escucharlos y aprender de ustedes. Estamos seguros que con su apoyo podemos hacer llegar esto al mundo entero.


Como estudiantes de Ingeniería, hemos adquirido habilidades y conocimientos importantes para llevar a cabo este proyecto. Desde pequeños siempre estuvimos interesados en la robótica, el diseño y en siempre querer hacer más. Todo esto ayudó a que hoy pudiésemos usar increíbles herramientas como cortadoras laser, impresoras 3D, tornos para mecanizado de piezas e incluso soldar.
Ganamos el concurso de PRECITYE (Programa Regional de Emprendedorismo e Innovación en Ingeniería), además un concurso de la OTT (Oficina de Transferencia Tecnológica) de nuestra Universidad, y fuimos finalistas en el JWEF (Foro Mundial del Emprendimiento Juvenil) realizado en Santiago de Chile.  Y ahora estamos muy orgullosos de haber ganado un capital semilla de CORFO.
Para potenciar aún más nuestro equipo estamos trabajando con distintos profesionales dando el máximo en sus áreas, como Mikaela, una de las mejores diseñadoras 3D; Cristián Haquin, emprendedor serial, experto desarrollador en bluetooth, y Co- Fundador de la compañía de teléfonos movil, Azumi.

All Orders Shipping Now!
You missed the campaign, but you can still order here on Indiegogo!
Our initial funding goal was met in the first 6 days of our campaign and we closed at 263% funded. Indiegogo put us on the IN-DEMAND program so you can still get one now! The Coolest Drone is Really, Really, Small.


Aerix Drones™ of Rochester, NY (a division of Morrison Innovations) is proud to introduce the Aerix Nano Drone for Beginners, featuring a bevy of technical and design improvements over the original CX-10 series quadcopters, including:


Built-in side and top impact guards to help prevent blade damage

Landing Skids that help keep the rotors off the ground and carpet

3-Speed calibration that provides smoother lift and maneuverability

Improved 6-Axis Stabilization for better hovering capability

Hard sided packaging that doubles as a protective storage and travel case
Easy to read and comprehend instruction manual (written in real English!)

We have designed the perfect learner drone that will save you thousands of dollars while you perfect the mechanics of quadcopter flight before moving onto larger, more expensive equipment.

Technology:

The built-in Aerix Nano Drone™ software is much more forgiving than a costly machine yet designed to function the same way, allowing you to master the basic techniques on a smaller, safer scale.
With the 6-Axis stabilization, you can hover easily and not have to worry about over compensating all of the time (that means no more “pogo-sticking” with your quadcopter too).
The 3-Speed Calibration allows us to create a phase for each learning process: 
 

The low-speed is designed to practice lifting off, trim, hovering and landing.
The mid-speed is designed to practice rotation and directional movement.
The hi-speed is designed for full flight functionality, including 4-direction flips.

Protection:
One of the main features that makes the Aerix Nano Drone for Beginners better than the competition is the use of built-in flight protection, making it the most beginner-friendly Nano Drone on the market.
Blade Guards:
The Aerix Nano Drone™ features a patented blade guard design that allows for gentle mistakes to be made against the ceiling and even walls without causing much damage or loss of flight time.
 

 
We found that a crash with other small quadcopters could scatter all four blades across the room. 
While, it was preferable that the blades popped off to prevent permanent breakage, it made sense to avoid that issue in the first place…hence the collision guard that limits having to re-install the blades. 
Landing Skids:
The patented design also includes removable landing skids which keep the motors off of the surface below.

The landing skids help to prevent the Aerix Nano Drone for Beginners from becoming tangled in carpet, pet hair or other debris found on the floor or ground, which would damage the blades and motor.

<p>UpCart® City simplifies daily tasks by reducing the effort of carrying items on stairs, over curbs and irregular terrain. Our unique multi-wheel design provides for smooth ride on any supporting surfaces and improves stability. Patented technology allows the UpCart City to fold completely flat for easy storage! Lightweight but strong, this folding cart can haul up to 77lbs just about anywhere. Save your back one stair at a time with the UpCart City! FEAR NO STAIR! </p>

<h2 style=""color: rgb(252, 174, 0);""> </h2>
<h2 style=""color: rgb(252, 174, 0);"">HOW DOES THE UPCART® CITY WORK? </h2>
<p>By using a multi-wheel design, the UpCart® City is able to ""walk"" over obstacles such as sidewalk curbs, stairs and uneven surfaces. As any wheel encounters an obstacle, the other wheels rotate forward over the obstacle, while the stopped wheel continues to support the load. This approach has several distinct advantages over the traditional single-wheel approach:  </p>
<ul>
<li>It is able to pivot to a different wheel and keep moving where a single wheel cart would get stuck.</li>
<li>UpCart City has two wheels on each side in contact with the ground (total of 4 wheels), with the load centered between them to improve stability and balance.</li>
<li>The multi-wheel design reduces the amount of effort required when moving up and down stairs and irregular terrain.</li>
<li>Tall handle (the tallest handle in its class) minimizes how far you bend your back and assures better posture when pulling a load on stairs. </li>
</ul>

<p>Our patented folding technology allows us to use a multi-wheel design yet still fold completely flat in seconds, with no disassembly required. Equally, UpCart® City unfolds in seconds fully assembled and ready to go. With the tallest handle in its class, the UpCart city minimizes bending and saves your back. The ability to use a multi-wheel design gives the cart extreme versatility. This isn't just a grocery getter, it's perfect for transporting boxes, laundry, potters, mulch, water softener, dog food, small furniture/appliances, you decide! UpCarts are Up For Anything!</p>

<h2 style=""color: rgb(252, 174, 0);"">WHAT PROBLEM DOES THE UPCART CITY SOLVE?</h2>
<p>If you have ever struggled to get something heavy or bulky up and down the stairs, but don't have the space for a large dolly, UpCart® City is your solution. The UpCart City is the most compact and portable multipurpose cart. The UpCart City can go virtually anywhere while carrying all your gear, then folds completely flat in seconds to fit easily in your car, on public transportation or in a closet. It's more than just a stair climber, this one small folding cart can be used for multiple purposes all year round. Save your back one stair at a time!</p>

<h2 style=""color: rgb(252, 174, 0);"">HISTORY OF THE UPCART</h2>
<p>We first tried to launch our company via crowdfunding campaign back in 2014. While our campaign did not fund, we found an angel investor and learned an amazing amount through the process. With the help of our angel investor, we brought our first product, the UpCart® Original, from idea to reality. Since then, we have successfully released the UpCart® Original and a number of additional products. And while we will always have a fond place in our hearts for the UpCart® Original, it is important to us that we listen to our customers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527707984/qnnzrupmihkbolzlheuk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>With that said, developing a new product is extremely challenging, risks always exist and delays are possible...</p>
<p>MANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product like this is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60-day lead time to create the molds and fixtures for a product of this size, and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility, we're working with manufacturers with a track record for prompt quality.</p>
<p>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the UpCart City gets ready for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product. They also allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by manufacturing partners and independent product testers. These will always be for the benefit of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.</p>
<p>FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. You have our commitment that we will do everything in our power to hit our timeline.</p>
<p>We are working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering folding hand carts in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but we have excellent partners with decades of experience sourcing similar products.

</div></div>","INTRODUCING THE UPCART® CITY

UpCart® City simplifies daily tasks by reducing the effort of carrying items on stairs, over curbs and irregular terrain. Our unique multi-wheel design provides for smooth ride on any supporting surfaces and improves stability. Patented technology allows the UpCart City to fold completely flat for easy storage! Lightweight but strong, this folding cart can haul up to 77lbs just about anywhere. Save your back one stair at a time with the UpCart City! FEAR NO STAIR! 

 

 
HOW DOES THE UPCART® CITY WORK? 
By using a multi-wheel design, the UpCart® City is able to ""walk"" over obstacles such as sidewalk curbs, stairs and uneven surfaces. As any wheel encounters an obstacle, the other wheels rotate forward over the obstacle, while the stopped wheel continues to support the load. This approach has several distinct advantages over the traditional single-wheel approach:  

It is able to pivot to a different wheel and keep moving where a single wheel cart would get stuck.
UpCart City has two wheels on each side in contact with the ground (total of 4 wheels), with the load centered between them to improve stability and balance.
The multi-wheel design reduces the amount of effort required when moving up and down stairs and irregular terrain.
Tall handle (the tallest handle in its class) minimizes how far you bend your back and assures better posture when pulling a load on stairs. 


 


 
WHAT MAKES THE UPCART® CITY UNIQUE?
Our patented folding technology allows us to use a multi-wheel design yet still fold completely flat in seconds, with no disassembly required. Equally, UpCart® City unfolds in seconds fully assembled and ready to go. With the tallest handle in its class, the UpCart city minimizes bending and saves your back. The ability to use a multi-wheel design gives the cart extreme versatility. This isn't just a grocery getter, it's perfect for transporting boxes, laundry, potters, mulch, water softener, dog food, small furniture/appliances, you decide! UpCarts are Up For Anything!

WHAT PROBLEM DOES THE UPCART CITY SOLVE?
If you have ever struggled to get something heavy or bulky up and down the stairs, but don't have the space for a large dolly, UpCart® City is your solution. The UpCart City is the most compact and portable multipurpose cart. The UpCart City can go virtually anywhere while carrying all your gear, then folds completely flat in seconds to fit easily in your car, on public transportation or in a closet. It's more than just a stair climber, this one small folding cart can be used for multiple purposes all year round. Save your back one stair at a time!

 
HISTORY OF THE UPCART
We first tried to launch our company via crowdfunding campaign back in 2014. While our campaign did not fund, we found an angel investor and learned an amazing amount through the process. With the help of our angel investor, we brought our first product, the UpCart® Original, from idea to reality. Since then, we have successfully released the UpCart® Original and a number of additional products. And while we will always have a fond place in our hearts for the UpCart® Original, it is important to us that we listen to our customers.

UpCart® City is a result of feedback from our amazing customers. You spoke, we listened. The UpCart® City has many of the same great features as its bigger brother, but was designed to be the most compact and portable all-terrain stair climber.

<h1><br/></h1>
<p>The global status report on road safety 2015 by WHO (reflecting 180 countries) depicts 1.25 mln deaths. In USA/EU ""only"" 55.000 deaths and over 500.000 heavily injured yearly (NHTSA; EU Transport Department). <b>Every 1% in reduction of these numbers means thousands of people alive or less injured</b>.</p>
<p><b>Blocked door opening</b> and <b>jammed seat belt cutting</b> <b>devices</b> open blocked doors and cut seat belts after accidents in every type of vehicles. This road safety system is based on similar principle as airbags. It is controlled by reliable electronic unit and sensors. Powered by gas generators. Completely safe for users and rescue teams. Smart and cheap - total cost should be below 200 USD per car (both front seats, mass production scale, new cars; in used cars hard to estimate but more expensive and only in authorized services). </p>

<p><b>How it works:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Automatic emergency door opening (AEDO, de-jammer):</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></span></p>
<b></b><p style=""display: inline !important;""><u>AEDO system</u> opens vehicle doors
jammed or blocked. It consists of telescopic actuators powered by electronically
controlled gas generators (same like in airbags). It is placed in the vehicle
door pillar. System works sequentially: 
firstly – it unlocks door bolts/locks, secondly – it checks with
very little gas generators  if door is blocked (without destroying it), 
thirdly – if door is blocked, it uses bigger gas generator and pushes the door out.</p>

<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>Seat belts emergency cutting system (SECS)</b></p>
<p><u>SECS system</u> cuts seat belts with a
pyrotechnic cutter which is mounted by the belt fixing to the car body. SECS
system is controlled by an electronic control unit (the same system as the one
used in AEDO above and airbags). </p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Both systems (AEDO and
SECS) are activated after an accident (collision, rollover / roll, fire,
sinking) and start working only after the vehicle stops and after a certain
delay - 5-15 sec (programmed individually by car makers).</span><br/></p>
<p>Blocked door opening and jammed seat belt cutting <b>system also works when vehicle doors are blocked due to  water pressure,</b> which makes it impossible to
open them before the vehicle completely sinks, people often drown trapped
in such vehicles.<br/></p>

The
devices are efficient for many years: </div>
<div><ul>
<li> operational durability of 15 years for
micro-explosives <br/>
</li>
<li> 20 years for mechanical parts.<br/>

<p><i><b>""System developed by Nowak Innovations is simple and effective. Pushing power is adjusted to the situation.

<p><i><b>""Electronic control unit of the system developed by Nowak Innovations can co-work with such control units of airbags or seat belt tensioners.

<p>There are only few such solutions on the market so far – GM and Audi
have implemented pyrotechnical charges in construction of vehicle windows (only
in bullet-proof limousine version of their serial models – Audi A8 L and GM – Cadillac
One, The Beast – the limousine of the US President). Mercedes in model Gullwing
uses complicated and expensive system of emergency door opening  - hinge blasting. In contrast to these “exclusive”
applications, Nowak Innovations’ system is universal and can be implemented in
every kind of automotive vehicle.</p>

<br/><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The beginning:</b></p>
<p>Our story started in the late 90's when one of our three inventors - Nowak brothers - witnessed a car accident in France. A young woman and two kids were trapped inside an overturned Renault 5. The kids, with help, managed to get out but the woman couldn't. Many people tried to help her but when smoke and fire started to threaten their lives they had to move away from the car. The woman burnt alive. Nowak brothers decided to try to prevent such tragic events and they started working on safety system which releases trapped drivers and passengers.</p>
<p>Nowak brothers (Nowak Innovations) aim to make the new road safety system a standard such as seat belts and airbags. Can you imagine driving a car not equipped with both of the above? Exactly! <b>The roads would be much safer with emergency door opening and seat belt cutting devices as obvious as  seat belts and airbags.</b></p>

<p><b>FAQ:</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>How often jammed doors occur - is it worth to be bothered? <span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">They occur very often, every third (32,5%) car accident causes driver/passengers entrapment;</span></p>
<p><b>Will the system work after an accident?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Yes, the system uses electronic system and gas generators - as air bags; air bags work;</span></p>
<p><b>Can it work incorrectly - cause an explosion?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Gas generators have to meet strict requirements concerning safety (e.g. mechanical failure and high temperature endurance); the same gas generators are used in air bags and seat belt tensioners;</span></p>
<p><b>Can emergency door opening system damage car during an inoffensive crash?</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The system works based on sensors and electronic control unit like air bags; in case jammed door  doesn’t occur and the system works anyway - it works sequentially, in the first phase system </span>opens<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the door lock, then the gas generator of low power examines the deadlock and if the door opens, the system stops working (the high power generators aren’t activated);</span></p>
<p><b>Does the system require periodic inspection?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It doesn’t, like air bags it is efficient for many years - operational durability of 15 years for gas generators and 20 years for mechanical parts;</span></p>
<p><b>Can the system be mounted in used cars?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Yes, the system can be mounted in used cars at Authorized Car Service Stations after mass production starts;</span></p>
<p><b>Is the system available only for the front door?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The system can be mounted in all car doors;</span></p>
<p><b>How much will it increase weight and costs?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The system weight doesn’t exceed 1kg per door; costs would increase by about 200 USD (both front doors);</span></p>
<p><b>Does the system require any renovation after it worked, after an accident?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The system can be used again, gas generators need to be replaced;</span></p>
<p><b>When will the system be available?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">About 12-18 months after car manufacturer’s decision to implement the system;</span></p>
<p><b>Does the system work when the car is sinking?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The system is waterproof, it can open door in sinking car; it would speed up sinking but enable victims to get out of the car;</span></p>
<p><b>How much time does the system need to open the door?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It depends on the electronic control unit settings, when a vehicle stops moving - about 5-20 seconds;</span></p>
<p><b>Is it possible to fix the door after an accident if the system worked?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It depends on the deadlock factor and cost-effectiveness as in case of other parts;</span></p>
<p><b>What happens if doors open upward?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The system works in such case as well;</span></p>

</div></div>","Next generation of Road Safety System ""LET THEM OUT!""
Seat belts and  airbags were a revolution. They significantly reduced the number of road accidents fatalities. Now it's time to introduce blocked door opening and jammed seat belt cutting devices to release drivers and passengers trapped inside damaged vehicles after road accidents.
We’ve already developed such solution, proved it effective during tests and patented worldwide (including EU, USA and Hong Kong).This safety system could be a real factor in decreasing fatalities number on a huge scale. Smart and cheap. Not related with driver's bad condition or decision. Works automatically like airbags. Saves lives. Potentially. When implemented.And if it is a standard for everyone, not exclusive feature in expensive cars. We have a great idea - but we are only a start-up with limited resources. Join us, support this idea.We’re not selling the devices here - we’re looking for support and contributors to go global! Join our safe journey!Why this system is so important: 
It minimizes at least two main threats that car users are exposed to: 
  entrapment due to blocked doors after accident because of deformed/distorted car body;

 unfastened seat belts' consequences.

Entrapment is very common. It increases the risk of death more than 800% in comparison to not entrapped victims of road accidents. The main cause of death among entrapped victims is bleeding.  High energy impacts most commonly entrap victims, however, the high energy also ensures the growth of death risk. It is hard to estimate precisely how much blocked door opening and jammed seat belt cutting devices can reduce mortality rate among entrapped victims. For sure they can reduce this numbers relevantly.source: Entrapped victims in motor vehicle collisions; Clinics Magazine, January 2011

Many car users deliberately fail to fasten their seat belts to avoid being trapped and as a consequence e.g. burn to death. EU Transport Commission estimates that fastened seat belts could save up to 7.300 lives yearly in EU. New safety system could minimize the fear of being entrapped and reduce this number.



source: EU Transport Commission 2014 seat belts                Eurostat statistics explained, Road safety statistics at regional level



The global status report on road safety 2015 by WHO (reflecting 180 countries) depicts 1.25 mln deaths. In USA/EU ""only"" 55.000 deaths and over 500.000 heavily injured yearly (NHTSA; EU Transport Department). Every 1% in reduction of these numbers means thousands of people alive or less injured.
Blocked door opening and jammed seat belt cutting devices open blocked doors and cut seat belts after accidents in every type of vehicles. This road safety system is based on similar principle as airbags. It is controlled by reliable electronic unit and sensors. Powered by gas generators. Completely safe for users and rescue teams. Smart and cheap - total cost should be below 200 USD per car (both front seats, mass production scale, new cars; in used cars hard to estimate but more expensive and only in authorized services). 





How it works:

Automatic emergency door opening (AEDO, de-jammer):
AEDO system opens vehicle doors
jammed or blocked. It consists of telescopic actuators powered by electronically
controlled gas generators (same like in airbags). It is placed in the vehicle
door pillar. System works sequentially: 
firstly – it unlocks door bolts/locks, secondly – it checks with
very little gas generators  if door is blocked (without destroying it), 
thirdly – if door is blocked, it uses bigger gas generator and pushes the door out.






Seat belts emergency cutting system (SECS)
SECS system cuts seat belts with a
pyrotechnic cutter which is mounted by the belt fixing to the car body. SECS
system is controlled by an electronic control unit (the same system as the one
used in AEDO above and airbags). 



Both systems (AEDO and
SECS) are activated after an accident (collision, rollover / roll, fire,
sinking) and start working only after the vehicle stops and after a certain
delay - 5-15 sec (programmed individually by car makers).
Blocked door opening and jammed seat belt cutting system also works when vehicle doors are blocked due to  water pressure, which makes it impossible to
open them before the vehicle completely sinks, people often drown trapped
in such vehicles.

The
devices are efficient for many years: 

 operational durability of 15 years for
micro-explosives 

 20 years for mechanical parts.



 

""System developed by Nowak Innovations is simple and effective. Pushing power is adjusted to the situation. When the doors are not blocked, the system can recognise it without unnecessary damages. The system is powered with electronically controlled gas generators,the same like in airbags. Completely safe for users and rescue teams.""            Pawel Goller, PIMOT Automotive Industry Institute, Warsaw, Poland
""Electronic control unit of the system developed by Nowak Innovations can co-work with such control units of airbags or seat belt tensioners. Or can work individually with own sensors and programmed by car makers in relevant way depending on the needs and law.""           Andrzej Sikora, PhD. Eng., prof. IEI, vice Director Industry Cooperation,                  Electrical Engineering Institute, Wroclaw, Poland

There are only few such solutions on the market so far – GM and Audi
have implemented pyrotechnical charges in construction of vehicle windows (only
in bullet-proof limousine version of their serial models – Audi A8 L and GM – Cadillac
One, The Beast – the limousine of the US President). Mercedes in model Gullwing
uses complicated and expensive system of emergency door opening  - hinge blasting. In contrast to these “exclusive”
applications, Nowak Innovations’ system is universal and can be implemented in
every kind of automotive vehicle.




The beginning:
Our story started in the late 90's when one of our three inventors - Nowak brothers - witnessed a car accident in France. A young woman and two kids were trapped inside an overturned Renault 5. The kids, with help, managed to get out but the woman couldn't. Many people tried to help her but when smoke and fire started to threaten their lives they had to move away from the car. The woman burnt alive. Nowak brothers decided to try to prevent such tragic events and they started working on safety system which releases trapped drivers and passengers.
Nowak brothers (Nowak Innovations) aim to make the new road safety system a standard such as seat belts and airbags. Can you imagine driving a car not equipped with both of the above? Exactly! The roads would be much safer with emergency door opening and seat belt cutting devices as obvious as  seat belts and airbags.


CALL to ACTION
Vote for this solution - we need a scale of supporters  to negotiate with road safety authorities and car manufacturers
every vote is 1 USD
We need funds to increase general awareness of the system: 

present it at motor shows (Paris, October 2016 and Detroit, January 2017);
lobbying among car experts and authorities;
give commercial presentations for 10 main car manufacturers plus Tesla (July - November 2016).  


MISSION POSSIBLE: new road safety standard  in every car at minimum cost.


Time: as soon as possible, 12-18 months from mass implementation decision.


You can not buy it now. You can only support us to encourage car manufacturers to implement this system to every new car.

Our declaration: we don't want to sell patents to any corporation exclusively but license them to everyone interested in, for ""little penny"" per car.

FAQ:


How often jammed doors occur - is it worth to be bothered? They occur very often, every third (32,5%) car accident causes driver/passengers entrapment;
Will the system work after an accident?Yes, the system uses electronic system and gas generators - as air bags; air bags work;
Can it work incorrectly - cause an explosion?Gas generators have to meet strict requirements concerning safety (e.g. mechanical failure and high temperature endurance); the same gas generators are used in air bags and seat belt tensioners;
Can emergency door opening system damage car during an inoffensive crash?The system works based on sensors and electronic control unit like air bags; in case jammed door  doesn’t occur and the system works anyway - it works sequentially, in the first phase system opens the door lock, then the gas generator of low power examines the deadlock and if the door opens, the system stops working (the high power generators aren’t activated);
Does the system require periodic inspection?It doesn’t, like air bags it is efficient for many years - operational durability of 15 years for gas generators and 20 years for mechanical parts;
Can the system be mounted in used cars?Yes, the system can be mounted in used cars at Authorized Car Service Stations after mass production starts;
Is the system available only for the front door?The system can be mounted in all car doors;
How much will it increase weight and costs?The system weight doesn’t exceed 1kg per door; costs would increase by about 200 USD (both front doors);
Does the system require any renovation after it worked, after an accident?The system can be used again, gas generators need to be replaced;
When will the system be available?About 12-18 months after car manufacturer’s decision to implement the system;
Does the system work when the car is sinking?The system is waterproof, it can open door in sinking car; it would speed up sinking but enable victims to get out of the car;
How much time does the system need to open the door?It depends on the electronic control unit settings, when a vehicle stops moving - about 5-20 seconds;
Is it possible to fix the door after an accident if the system worked?It depends on the deadlock factor and cost-effectiveness as in case of other parts;
What happens if doors open upward?The system works in such case as well;
Will the system work the same way in every car type?The operational principle is the same in mechanical terms; differences may result from electronic control unit settings depending on the manufacturer’s needs and standards and the region applicable law;
Can an event such as an earthquake activate the system?Sensors activating the system, electronic control unit and gas generators work alike air bags - they are refractory to all phenomena causing unwarranted action;

The risk of device’s uncontrolled activation is the same as in case of air bags.
How can I implement the solution into my car?It is best to purchase the system in a new car as soon as it comes on stream but we’re trying to make it possible to mount the system in used cars at Authorized Car Service Stations.
Does the system work only during severe accidents or also inoffensive crashes?Likewise air bags system, the device will be activated when the impact force specified by the manufacturer is reached; the system initiation threshold can be set as desired depending on the needs and practical usage.
Can the system be activated spontaneously, e.g. because of temperature?The system is refractory even to high temperatures.
Does the system work in the cold?Even very low temperatures aren't a problem for the system.
Will the system work if the battery is destroyed?Yes, the system is equipped with emergency power supply (capacitors).
How does the explosive materials used in the device work? Aren’t they too strong?The system works based on gas generators which are used on a massive scale, e.g. in air bags; they don’t pose any threat.
Does any company use similar solutions?There are not such solutions on the market; the most comparable is hinge blasting (manual or automatic) used on small scale in armored vehicles - expensive and causing severe damages, requiring additional intervention involving forcing out the door.

EcoReco has figured out the basic and nuances in scooter design: modularized rear tire (separateable from the motor), right balance and weight distribution, handle and control, wheel size to base ratio, trade-offs between speed and torque, voltage systems and drives, so you only need to consider the range and configure your ride styles.</span></p></li>
<li><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'><strong>Compliance and regulations</strong>: Scooters with more than 750 Wh are subjected to the special registration, </span>license<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> and insurance requirements with DMV. Most states only allow e-scooters and bikes to go under 20 mph (it's already very fast on a personal EV!). That's why we choose to develop the most efficient scooter in a lightweight package instead of just throwing high capacity batteries and wasteful motors to handle all your usage scenarios. </span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>No risk backing</strong>: EcoReco is an established company with a professional team and existing products. You can swap your Model R backing to our existing models if you don't like the development progress. Your pledge is safe with EcoReco.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More than utility</strong>: EcoReco scooter is just sleekier and cooler. Our vision for the personal mobility sets us apart from imitators and their low-cost importers.</p></li>

<h3>EcoReco Model R is Ridiculously Feature-Rich</h3>

<p>Model R offers the unmatched freedom to choose the most preferred riding mode in any occasion.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Throttle (Classic) mode</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Indoor use, outdoor racing, cruise control, you can master the speeds at your finger under the classic Throttle mode. Or get the extra BOOST for hill climbing</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">You can also set up the top speed, and configure acceleration ramp-up using the EcoReco smartphone app.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Kick-Assist</strong> <strong>modes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Kick-Ass Amplified</strong> mode is perfect when you want to exercise or ride the scooter stealthily. The smart sensors can read and calculate your kick, and push you faster and further with the electric power boost.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Kick-Ass Extended</strong> mode enables the longest range out of your scooter. It maintains the top speed you can reach from manual kicks until the battery runs out or the brake is pressed. </li>

<p>Safety is essential for personal transportation, and that's why we pack a lot of <strong>lighting</strong> and active safety features such <strong>Lightvigation</strong>,  <strong>eBCAS</strong> and <strong>Carefree Fall Notification</strong> on Model R.</p>
<h3>Let the light guide you </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481148158/wbhspkdyzhpwc72vlfld.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Model R cleverly integrates the turn-by-turn navigation with turn signals on the handlebars and the rear fender. The patented <strong>Lightvigation</strong>  would notify you where to turn while you keep eyes on the roads, and cars around you would know your next moves at all time. The flash frequency also changes quicker when you get closer to the turn, so you would never miss your turn.</p>
<h3>Model R protects you like an angel</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481158265/j1onym9usw3p03e2vpzd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Model R implemented emerging standard <strong>eBCAS (Early Bicycle Collision Avoidance System)</strong> that enables cars to detect nearby connected bikes and scooters. Your Model R is detectable even when out of sight (fog, traffic, blind spots, around the corner etc.) for smart cars with the same advanced feature. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481209388/jceig3o1luvscno07hdt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In the rare event of an impact or fall, sensors on Model R would record the impacts and scooter conditions. After several secs of inactivity of both rider and the scooter, the patented <strong>Carefree Fall Notification</strong> would trigger your smartphone to text the GPS location to a pre-set emergency contact. Just for your and your loved one's peace of mind that Model R is your safety guardian.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481207606/h1aiuoqneylnnswq8ums.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Model R is more practical and secure than a bike because you can bring it with you anywhere so there is a lower risk of getting it stolen. To make it even more secure, we make it lockable physically thru a <strong>lock hole</strong> or electronically by the app to keep any curious and ill-intentioned away (the built-in buzzer could be really loud!!).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481158286/hqjbzotwingpfci6jbtx.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481207730/gfjz1aihgykddxekm6qd.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>You can unlock the <strong>electronic lock</strong> with a configurable button sequence from the throttle unit or use your phone as a proximity <strong>smart key</strong>. You can also send a temporary access code to your friends for scooter sharing.</p>
<h3>First findable scooter without a data plan</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481207764/oubatwbvgpsz6iukviq1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>EcoReco partners with Tile, the leading Bluetooth tracking device maker, to natively integrate the tracking function. Even if you have to step away from Model R, the <strong>built-in Tile</strong> feature can keep you updated on its whereabout. You would receive a notification if it's moved out of range. You can also leverage the world's leading <strong>crowd-finding Tile network</strong> to locate your Model R, find where it's last seen, or get notified when it's found again.</p>
<p>No hassle with a sim card and data plan. No additional costs. Simple as that.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481207796/jqbfkrplr4jcdvoxtldt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Your life is eventful so your personal ride should be versatile to make the best of it. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481845494/iquwjwcayujg2a5fka4w.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All Model R battery packs are made of Panasonic cells, similar to the ones Tesla uses for its EVs, which are highly stable and reliable. There are 2 battery sizes to choose from. The ""<strong>Lite</strong>"" battery pack solves your last mile needs while offering low costs, light weight, and portability. It also follows the Federal Aviation Regulation compliance for air travels. The “<strong>Pro</strong>” battery pack (300Wh) gives you max power and lasts 10-20 ranges.</p>
<p>The battery bays are under your feet and batteries are <strong>quickly swappable</strong>. The batteries install in a forward or rear slot, ensuring that the scooter is never off-balance to the left or right. You have the freedom to choose the right battery size you need and to expand later. You can also use the extra space to store a travel charger or other things you like.</p>
<p>The patented <strong>Dynamic Battery Switching</strong> system coordinates Model R battery packs. It adjusts the power performance automatically and shuts off immediately under unusual situations. You can choose to use just one single pack or to mix-or-match different battery packs where you could set to use them in tandem or simultaneously. </p>
<p>It's safe, balanced, and flexible.</p>

<h3>FAQ:</h3>
<p>For basic questions about EcoReco scooters in general, please visit (<a href=""https://ecorecoscooter.com/faq/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ecorecoscooter.com/faq</a>)<br/>If you can't find your answers about Model R there and below, please ask us in <strong>Comments</strong> and we will update the most asked question here.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Model R looks head and shoulders above any scooters on the market. I want a lot of my friends to know about it. Do you have a referral program to refer friends for a discount? Or a bulk discount?</span></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Yes. You can use our referral program [See<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ecoreco-model-r-ultimate-personal-ev-for-all/x/15339763#/updates"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Update #2</a>] to get discounts on your unit or even get it completely free. You and your friends can also back the Love Bird or Rude Boys perks for multi-unit purchases.</p>
<p><strong>Do you ship internationally?</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Yes. We would love to expand our EcoReco trek to more places so <strong>international backers are very welcome</strong>. Please notes that (1) arrangements of international shipments might cause slight delays in comparison with shipments for US backers. (2) If the shipping costs are more than $250 (for Model R) for your specific location, the difference would need to be collected additionally before we ship out the products. (3) Because we couldn't factor it in in advance, the <strong>customs fees and duty are backer's responsibility</strong>. In the rare case, any other fees associated with import goods inspection, storage, return, damage, and other extra fees in comparison with a similar US shipment would not be covered by EcoReco.</p>
<p><strong>How do you charge the scooter? Does it take 220V?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Our scooters can be charged conveniently using regular wall outlets via the included external charger. The charger is CE certified, and it can take 110-240V, just like most popular consumer electronics. We work our best to make your life simpler.</p>
<p><strong>Can I do a local pick up?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Yes. You are welcome to attend our local delivery gathering in the San Francisco bay areas that we would announce dates and locations later. You would be able to get some extra perks and meet our EcoReco team if you show up!!<br/>Unfortunately, we won’t be able to arrange individual pick up or waive the shipping fees for logistic reasons.</p>
<p><strong>What is the weight limit for a rider?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We recommend up to 280 pounds for best performance even though the mechanics can support heavy riders. Please note the scooter’s top speed will decrease slightly for heavier riders on flat ground, but its performance would be noticeably affected in accelerations on and slopes.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I ride the e-scooter? Is it street legal?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">State laws vary on this issue. <strong>Most states require the top speed to be below 20 MPH</strong>. Some state laws approve the use of electric scooters in bike lanes of general road traffic and some do not. To the best of our knowledge (don’t hold it against us), e-scooters are street legal in California, Connecticut, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, Texas, Virginia and Washington, with many other states expected to follow suit. Some cities/counties have their own rules on light electric vehicles so<strong> it’s best to consult with your local transportation authorities</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Is the scooter water resist? Can it handle the rain?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The scooter is built like a tank, not a submarine. ;)<br/>It's water-resist so you can use a water hose to clean it. but it's not water-proof, so don't dump it in a pool. We put pretty good sealing all around. If you get caught up by the rain on the way home, it will still work. Just remember to wipe out water and let it dry afterward. Moist and electronics don't get along well.<br/>With that being said, we still recommend avoiding riding in the rain for safety reasons, mainly due to poor visions and road conditions.  </p>
<p><strong>What happens if my scooter has an issue and I need tech support?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">EcoReco has also established a <strong>best-in-industry service network in the US and actively looked for global expansion</strong>. EcoReco also provides a comprehensive customer support materials including the <a href=""https://ecorecoscooter.com/faq/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">troubleshooting guide</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXHj8rsvTAhzneEXRLjBS9g"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">technical support videos</a>. </p>
<p><strong>What's the warranty of the Model R?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The statutory warranty on the frame, the electronic system and the battery pack is 6 months for manufacturing defects. Wears-n-tears of consumable parts, damages caused by improper usages &amp; user's negligence, and water damage are not under the warranty.</p>
<p><strong>How well can the Model R scooter handle a hill?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">For a normal 170 lbs weight person, our scooter can take an uphill up to ~20-degree incline (~35% slope), which should be adequate for more than 99.99% of streets/roads. A rider can also kick scoot a bit to increase the up-hill speeds or take a longer detour.</p>
<p><strong>Will you be providing other accessories and personalized products?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Yes, we are working hard to provide an array of accessories to complement the e-scooter. What do yo would like to have?</p>
<p><strong>Will you guys keep improving Model R or make new scooters for other demography?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">You bet!</p>
<p><strong>Does the Model R have any LCD display included or do you have to use your phone and an app?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p>Yes. You can operate Model R using the built-in LCD display for most of the daily functions. You can choose to access more advanced features and the rich configurabilities using the EcoReco app on your smartphone. </p>

An eco-friendly, energy-efficient, compact and intelligent electric scooter, designed for your everyday urban commute. Model R is a giant leap forward from its wildly popular EcoReco predecessors while keeping the same premium quality and excellent customer support.



 








Model R is the best way to move in urban cities

EcoReco Model R is designed to provide an unprecedentedly fun, intuitive, and practical user experience for personal commute and recreation. Packed with generous specs and full of innovative features, such as Dynamic Battery Switching System, Carefree Fall Detection, Lightvigation, Tile location tracking, smart lock, and endless configurablility, EcoReco is the ultimate last mile EV for your active lifestyle and passion for technologies.


EcoReco knows scooters 
A scooter is safer than a skateboard and more portable than a bike. It is accessible for everyone and compatible with cars and public transits. We believed the form factor so much we created a company to make it.
Since established in 2013, EcoReco has been widely considered the best scooter maker that revived a faded industry and opened up markets for more electric personal transports. Here are some reasons that tens of thousands of riders choosing EcoReco: 

Domestic supports: EcoReco is based in Silicon Valley, and we provide sales and technical supports domestically with established service networks. We don't do ship directly from the factory non-sense because your backers deserve better and our continuous supports
Proven track records on design and quality: EcoReco knows what ingredients work so you don't need to be your own chef to navigate a maze of combinations and try your luck. EcoReco has figured out the basic and nuances in scooter design: modularized rear tire (separateable from the motor), right balance and weight distribution, handle and control, wheel size to base ratio, trade-offs between speed and torque, voltage systems and drives, so you only need to consider the range and configure your ride styles.
Compliance and regulations: Scooters with more than 750 Wh are subjected to the special registration, license and insurance requirements with DMV. Most states only allow e-scooters and bikes to go under 20 mph (it's already very fast on a personal EV!). That's why we choose to develop the most efficient scooter in a lightweight package instead of just throwing high capacity batteries and wasteful motors to handle all your usage scenarios. 
No risk backing: EcoReco is an established company with a professional team and existing products. You can swap your Model R backing to our existing models if you don't like the development progress. Your pledge is safe with EcoReco.
More than utility: EcoReco scooter is just sleekier and cooler. Our vision for the personal mobility sets us apart from imitators and their low-cost importers.

EcoReco Model R is Ridiculously Feature-Rich
The feature list of Model R is so long that we can only list the key ones here. When you feel tired reading it, the exit is the backing button on your right. ;)



Model R offers the unmatched freedom to choose the most preferred riding mode in any occasion.
Throttle (Classic) mode:

Indoor use, outdoor racing, cruise control, you can master the speeds at your finger under the classic Throttle mode. Or get the extra BOOST for hill climbing
You can also set up the top speed, and configure acceleration ramp-up using the EcoReco smartphone app.

Kick-Assist modes:


Kick-Ass Amplified mode is perfect when you want to exercise or ride the scooter stealthily. The smart sensors can read and calculate your kick, and push you faster and further with the electric power boost.

Kick-Ass Extended mode enables the longest range out of your scooter. It maintains the top speed you can reach from manual kicks until the battery runs out or the brake is pressed. 


Safety is essential for personal transportation, and that's why we pack a lot of lighting and active safety features such Lightvigation,  eBCAS and Carefree Fall Notification on Model R.
Let the light guide you 

Model R cleverly integrates the turn-by-turn navigation with turn signals on the handlebars and the rear fender. The patented Lightvigation  would notify you where to turn while you keep eyes on the roads, and cars around you would know your next moves at all time. The flash frequency also changes quicker when you get closer to the turn, so you would never miss your turn.
Model R protects you like an angel

Model R implemented emerging standard eBCAS (Early Bicycle Collision Avoidance System) that enables cars to detect nearby connected bikes and scooters. Your Model R is detectable even when out of sight (fog, traffic, blind spots, around the corner etc.) for smart cars with the same advanced feature. 

In the rare event of an impact or fall, sensors on Model R would record the impacts and scooter conditions. After several secs of inactivity of both rider and the scooter, the patented Carefree Fall Notification would trigger your smartphone to text the GPS location to a pre-set emergency contact. Just for your and your loved one's peace of mind that Model R is your safety guardian.

Model R is more practical and secure than a bike because you can bring it with you anywhere so there is a lower risk of getting it stolen. To make it even more secure, we make it lockable physically thru a lock hole or electronically by the app to keep any curious and ill-intentioned away (the built-in buzzer could be really loud!!).
 You can unlock the electronic lock with a configurable button sequence from the throttle unit or use your phone as a proximity smart key. You can also send a temporary access code to your friends for scooter sharing.
First findable scooter without a data plan

EcoReco partners with Tile, the leading Bluetooth tracking device maker, to natively integrate the tracking function. Even if you have to step away from Model R, the built-in Tile feature can keep you updated on its whereabout. You would receive a notification if it's moved out of range. You can also leverage the world's leading crowd-finding Tile network to locate your Model R, find where it's last seen, or get notified when it's found again.
No hassle with a sim card and data plan. No additional costs. Simple as that.

Your life is eventful so your personal ride should be versatile to make the best of it. 

All Model R battery packs are made of Panasonic cells, similar to the ones Tesla uses for its EVs, which are highly stable and reliable. There are 2 battery sizes to choose from. The ""Lite"" battery pack solves your last mile needs while offering low costs, light weight, and portability. It also follows the Federal Aviation Regulation compliance for air travels. The “Pro” battery pack (300Wh) gives you max power and lasts 10-20 ranges.
The battery bays are under your feet and batteries are quickly swappable. The batteries install in a forward or rear slot, ensuring that the scooter is never off-balance to the left or right. You have the freedom to choose the right battery size you need and to expand later. You can also use the extra space to store a travel charger or other things you like.
The patented Dynamic Battery Switching system coordinates Model R battery packs. It adjusts the power performance automatically and shuts off immediately under unusual situations. You can choose to use just one single pack or to mix-or-match different battery packs where you could set to use them in tandem or simultaneously. 
It's safe, balanced, and flexible.


The possibilities are endless!

You can mount all your gadgets including your phone, GoPro and camera on our universal mount on the handlebar and charge them on the go using the USB port on the throttle unit. Most bike accessories work well on EcoReco scooters and there would be more 1st part and 3rd party accessories to make Model R even more useful in all occasions. Share what your want to see in the comment sections, and we and our EcoReco community might actually make it happen! 
Partnership and expandability 

EcoReco is teaming up with Sony | Future Lab Program to explore the applications in the realm overlapped by personal mobility and smart wearable devices. N is a prototype featuring a voice interaction system. With ears open, hands-free, and eyes no longer distracted by mobile displays, you can enjoy music and get up-to-the-minute information on demand, promoting a more agreeable active lifestyle. It's a great hit at SXSW this year. Stay tuned for more technical details of our co-development program.
If you are also based in San Francisco bay areas, you can also participate in the FLP with us. For more information, please visit Sony Future Lab Program N.

FAQ:
For basic questions about EcoReco scooters in general, please visit (ecorecoscooter.com/faq)If you can't find your answers about Model R there and below, please ask us in Comments and we will update the most asked question here.

Model R looks head and shoulders above any scooters on the market. I want a lot of my friends to know about it. Do you have a referral program to refer friends for a discount? Or a bulk discount?
Yes. You can use our referral program [See Update #2] to get discounts on your unit or even get it completely free. You and your friends can also back the Love Bird or Rude Boys perks for multi-unit purchases.
Do you ship internationally? 
Yes. We would love to expand our EcoReco trek to more places so international backers are very welcome. Please notes that (1) arrangements of international shipments might cause slight delays in comparison with shipments for US backers. (2) If the shipping costs are more than $250 (for Model R) for your specific location, the difference would need to be collected additionally before we ship out the products. (3) Because we couldn't factor it in in advance, the customs fees and duty are backer's responsibility. In the rare case, any other fees associated with import goods inspection, storage, return, damage, and other extra fees in comparison with a similar US shipment would not be covered by EcoReco.
How do you charge the scooter? Does it take 220V?
Our scooters can be charged conveniently using regular wall outlets via the included external charger. The charger is CE certified, and it can take 110-240V, just like most popular consumer electronics. We work our best to make your life simpler.
Can I do a local pick up?
Yes. You are welcome to attend our local delivery gathering in the San Francisco bay areas that we would announce dates and locations later. You would be able to get some extra perks and meet our EcoReco team if you show up!!Unfortunately, we won’t be able to arrange individual pick up or waive the shipping fees for logistic reasons.
What is the weight limit for a rider?
We recommend up to 280 pounds for best performance even though the mechanics can support heavy riders. Please note the scooter’s top speed will decrease slightly for heavier riders on flat ground, but its performance would be noticeably affected in accelerations on and slopes.
Where can I ride the e-scooter? Is it street legal?
State laws vary on this issue. Most states require the top speed to be below 20 MPH. Some state laws approve the use of electric scooters in bike lanes of general road traffic and some do not. To the best of our knowledge (don’t hold it against us), e-scooters are street legal in California, Connecticut, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, Texas, Virginia and Washington, with many other states expected to follow suit. Some cities/counties have their own rules on light electric vehicles so it’s best to consult with your local transportation authorities.
Is the scooter water resist? Can it handle the rain?
The scooter is built like a tank, not a submarine. ;)It's water-resist so you can use a water hose to clean it. but it's not water-proof, so don't dump it in a pool. We put pretty good sealing all around. If you get caught up by the rain on the way home, it will still work. Just remember to wipe out water and let it dry afterward. Moist and electronics don't get along well.With that being said, we still recommend avoiding riding in the rain for safety reasons, mainly due to poor visions and road conditions.  
What happens if my scooter has an issue and I need tech support?
EcoReco has also established a best-in-industry service network in the US and actively looked for global expansion. EcoReco also provides a comprehensive customer support materials including the troubleshooting guide and technical support videos. 
What's the warranty of the Model R?
The statutory warranty on the frame, the electronic system and the battery pack is 6 months for manufacturing defects. Wears-n-tears of consumable parts, damages caused by improper usages & user's negligence, and water damage are not under the warranty.
How well can the Model R scooter handle a hill?
For a normal 170 lbs weight person, our scooter can take an uphill up to ~20-degree incline (~35% slope), which should be adequate for more than 99.99% of streets/roads. A rider can also kick scoot a bit to increase the up-hill speeds or take a longer detour.
Will you be providing other accessories and personalized products?
Yes, we are working hard to provide an array of accessories to complement the e-scooter. What do yo would like to have?
Will you guys keep improving Model R or make new scooters for other demography?
You bet!
Does the Model R have any LCD display included or do you have to use your phone and an app?
 
Yes. You can operate Model R using the built-in LCD display for most of the daily functions. You can choose to access more advanced features and the rich configurabilities using the EcoReco app on your smartphone. 
Does the scooter have a USB charging port?
Yes. The UPS port is on the Throttle/dash unit for easy access.",64.0,2,"1 Campaign

It continuously analyzes eye blinking frequency, eyes movement, and other facial expression patterns.   Hi, this is Andy, co-founder of Ridy.Driving a car after an exhausting working day is dangerous. I've learned it the hard way - I've crashed my car in an accident. But it's not only about being tired. We are so used to our smartphones, that texting, liking Instagram posts becomes a natural habit. Unfortunately, many people forget that it is dangerous and illegal to do that while driving.   Driving a long road? Working long shifts? Have a teen driver in the family? Get Ridy! Install Ridy on your dashboard or windshield (see more installation options below):Ridy will monitor if you are focused on the road by analyzing various behavior patterns.For example, if you feel drowsy and might fall asleep.Or if you (or your teen kid) are checking your Snapchat stories or texting your friends.Your kids won't distract you from driving! Even at night or in the tunnel. Ridy will alert you if it thinks you feel drowsy or distracted. Ridy is simple to use and won't ruin your driving experience.   
You think it can never happen to you or your loved ones?
U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) warns: one-third of U.S. adults sleep less than seven hours a day (the optimal time needed). A lack of sleep slows your reaction time and overall awareness. It increases car accident risk and negatively impacts your driving performance.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHERE WE'RE AT</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are launching with indiegogo for three reasons, so that we can gauge how much of a demand there is for our watercraft, so that we can deliver our boats faster through pre-ordering, and so that we can offer the best direct to the consumer pricing by being able to control and bulk order manufacturing inventory. We are ready to start making units, we have everything we need to start production, and full control of the assembly process, which is being done at our own facility. Our engines are being sourced from Honda, one of the world's most reputable brands, and our other components are non proprietary boat parts, which are already being manufactured in bulk for the world market. We have designed our hull manufacturing and assembly process to be scale-able, so whether we receive only 20 Mantra orders or the full limited run of 680, we have ensured that we can deliver on time.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Your contribution will directly help to create employment in Tablas Island, Philippines, a place with very high unemployment and poverty rates.  Our manufacturing process is intentionally designed to be labor intensive, so we can hire more people and use less machines! We also pledge that for every kilogram of watercraft we sell, we will clean a kilogram of plastic waste from the ocean. So each Mantra watercraft perk ordered will sponsor the cleaning of 134kg of plastic garbage from the ocean. This will also further help create employment in our area.</p>

The ER kit will drastically change the design of your bike without modifying anything on the factory chassis, retaining reliability, performance and safety. No grinding, no welding, no long waits, only basic tools are needed to customize your one-of-a-kind motorcycle. Our kit is for any rider who wants to customize the R nineT in their garage with standard tools and that doesn't require any welding skills or special equipment.FeaturesThe ER Kit is a bolt-on kit that allows you to customize your stock R nineT by yourself without any special mechanical skills, to transform it into a one-of-a-kind motorcycle.Available in BMW color themes: Other colors can be selected on demand.1/ Front FairingMaintained by its metal structure mounted on the factory chassis, the front fairing incorporates the new lighting system : a dual position lenticular optics coupled with a led bar acting as a position light.  2/ Front mudguard/Fork coverOur front fender comes with an ultra neat design which has two functions : fender and fork cover. 3/ TailThe new rear shell and side covers greatly changes the look of the original rear of your R nineT. You can also remove it at will and mount the passenger seat if you want to carry someone with you. 4/ Radiator side guardsYour radiator will be protected with 2 side guards participating in the racing aspect of the ER kit.  5/ Dab Design CNC logosFinal detail : 2 CNC Aluminum Dab Design emblems which will make your bike make your bike look like a real gem. 6/ Dual position lenticular headlight E4 CERTIFIED & LED daylight strip E4 CERTIFIEDAsymmetry is the signature of BMW Motorrad, and to keep its essence, we have selected these two perfect, street legal lighting components, that will add style and safety to your bike.Design We have reconstructed the BMR R nine T in 3D with 3D scanners, to record as accurately as possible, all dimensions and details. Once the motorcycle has been virtualized, all our components have been carefully designed and simulated in 3D and then sent to our manufacturer in France. For pilots who want to carry someone occasionally, the rear shell can still be removed and replaced by the BMW passenger seat.New bike, new challenge. The keywords of this project were: ""Style, Racing, Innovation, Design and ... Safety"".The trend of custom is widespread around the world, but there are still some sensitive topics ... like the conformity and security of your bike. As a custom motorcycles builder, we decided to offer a kit with a completely unique design and 100% safe. That is to say that the kit can be mounted without modifying anything on the factory motorcycle to keep the stock bike structure and its conformity.  What do I need to install the ER kit? A 2014 or later model BMW R nineT 1200. The ER kit can also be mounted on the BMW R nineT Pure and Racer, only the front fender needs to be adapted.Basic tools (sockets, screwdrivers, ... )Basic wiring skills : the front headlight requires rewiring the lenticular optic and the LED strip.The desire to ride a unique motorcycleNote: If you like the others parts mounted on our demonstration R nineT, we have made a suggestion of parts on our website especially for you.  Our Offer Our MissionAs a custom motorcycle company, we are aware that customizing a motorcycle is a really tough work. You are starting with a basic motorcycle that you have to transform into a one-of-a-kind machine. That means a lot of time-consuming manufacturing steps (welding, rewiring, bodywork, metal shaping, ...). We want to make customization accessible to as many people as possible through innovative custom parts. We want to stimulate riders to customize their own custom motorcycle, which gives a personal satisfaction that you will not find anywhere else.The ER kit has been tested, validated and approved by our manufacturer. Right now, the only thing we need is to raise some money in order to pay manufacturing costs linked to production like molds and materials.Over the last months, we received a lot emails about doing our own line of custom products.Time has come.By backing us today, you will allow us to commercialize the ER kit and also democratize our vision of customization. About Dab DesignBy mastering the unexpected alliance of new technologies and craftsmanship, Dab Design shakes up the custombike rules and reinvents a little more each day its own playground.Thanks to new manufacturing and design technologies, each step of a project is redefined, from the visualization of the final product to the manufacturing of custom parts. This atypical vision is the essence and the strength of Dab Design, founded by Simon Dabadie in 2015.Simon is a kind of mixture of engineering, design and motorcycling.He worked in these new emerging industries such as 3D Printing, 3D software publishing and also in the world of custombikes, especially for Roland Sands Design and Deus Ex Machina. With all these emerging technologies, Simon set himself the challenge of customizing motorcycles in a totally antagonistic way to the oldschool spirit, integrating new technologies into the creative process.This is how Dab Design was born. The desire to create exclusive motorcycles in a very specific way.

<h3>An Innovative technology that not just re-invented the wheel, it re-invented the bike.</h3>
<p>The dream of developing a future bicycle began when I was a teenager, and I have been trying and searching for development concepts for years. <br/>The SuperWheel project started in 2014 and later working with two Irish universities (DKIT and DCU)  and was supported by Enterprise Ireland and Climate-KIC programmes. (EU acceleration programme focused on climate impact by cleantech commercialization.) </p>
<p>After numerous prototypes, modifications and testing (both in house and by public) within the past four years, including the public trial run event in DKIT this July. This revolutionary Weight (mass) to energy conversion technology (WTECT) is now ready to be introduced to the world.</p>

<h3>SuperWheel - Future Impacts</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Fundamentally bicycle technology has changed little over the past one hundred years. This means that cycling is hard work, in particular cycling uphill or for long distances.</p>
<p>Currently E-Bikes provide the only technology that can improve cycling efficiency. However, they are restricted by the range limitations due to the on-board battery technology. </p>
<p>Some materials used in E-Bike batteries are toxic to the environment.</p>
<p>SuperWheel was developed as an alternative to electric power to allow the user enjoy cycling without the hard work. Simply replace the back wheel of your bike to a SuperWheel and get immediate power assistance to aid you when cycling uphill making your long cycling journeys an enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>SuperWheel technology maintains the traditional value of the bicycle, it’s convenient to use and 100% human powered and lasts a very, very long time.</p>
<h3>Why we need your help? </h3>
</div><div>
<p>The prototype development and the testing trials of SuperWheel have been completed and we are currently fine tuning the design, optimising parts, configurations and logistics.</p>
<p>We now need a large batch order to start production and are reaching out to the Indiegogo community for support to raise the required funds to get this exciting product to the market. </p>

<span style=""color: red;"">Turning on the stop lights during engine braking</span> 
(when the driver do not press the brake lever).<br/>
Motorcycle structure and lightweight allows you to achieve great acceleration, that causes powerful engine braking as well.  There are well known situations where unnecessary danger is caused because neither  car or motorcycle did not notice that vehicle in front of it is braking. Especially in motorcycles where “the stop lights” is activated by sensor in a braking lever. The stop light will not activate during the engine braking – when the throttle grip is released. At that moment the speed loss is huge and could easily reach 2m/s! Quite a lot of experienced motorcyclists instinctively pushes the braking lever gently during engine braking – even if situation do not require – just to announce the speed loss to other vehicles. And this is the moment where SAMO – The Safety Ride Module comes into action. Thanks to the built-in accelerometer our module by itself detects the braking power and automatically signals this activity by using the stop lights.</span></font></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><font><span style=""line-height: 115%;""></span></font></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F83754998&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><font><br/></font><p></p>

<span style=""color: red;"">Switching Emergency Lights on</span> (turn lights) during emergency braking. Unexpected situations on the road are very dangerous – also from the vehicles behind us. Driver behind you may not see the cause of your emergency braking, therefore it is very important to warn the driver about this situation as soon as it possible. In brand new cars emergency braking is indicated by emergency lights – our module automatically warns vehicles behind us by flashing turn lights in case of emergency braking if the braking force exceeds a certain value.</span></font></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><font><span style=""line-height: 115%;""></span></font></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F83992240&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><font><br/></font><p></p>

<span style=""color: red;"">Increased the STOP signalisation.</span> 
Motorcycle equipped in our module warns drivers about braking much more efficiently. Instead of constant light with no intensity change, our system instantly flashes 4-5 times before the STOP light illuminates continuously.<br/>
A lot of “Safe Motorcycle Driving” manuals recommends to push braking lever several times before the proper braking – from now on, our module will do it for us.</span></font></p>

<span style=""color: red;"">The ALARM function.</span>If you connect the module to the ignition wire, the simple alarm mode would be turned on. The Alarm turns on automatically a few seconds after turning the ignition switch off. The Module signals alarm with turn lights, stop light and horn caused by motorcycle vibration or inclination –  until the owner switches the ignition to “ACC” position.</span></font></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><font><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">-<span style=""color: red;"">The SOS function.</span>
On the road sometimes we can face some unexpected dangerous situations – collision or glide. It is extremely important to inform other road users about collision instantly. Using turn lights, stop light and klaxon, overturned motorcycle efficiently informs about danger. The signalisation continues until we switch the ignition off, or pull up the motorcycle.</span></font></p>

<span style=""color: red;"">Einschalten des Stopplichts während des bremsen mit dem Motor</span> 
(wenn der Motorradfahrer die Bremse nicht betätigt).<br/>
Das Motorrad erlaubt es, dank seiner Konstruktion, blitzartig zu beschleunigen und die leichte Masse verursachen, dass das abbremsen mit dem Motor ebenfalls sehr stark ist und das Motorrad schnell an Geschwindigkeit verliert. Persönlich war ich Zeuge von einigen Ereignissen bei denen es zu unnötigen Gefahrensituationen gekommen ist, da der Autofahrer bzw. Motorradfahrer das vor ihm stoppende Gefährt nicht bemerkt hat. Vor allem bei Motorrädern, ist das „Stopplicht“ erst dann sichtbar wenn wir den Bremshebel betätigt und nicht wenn wir die Hand vom Gasnehmen und mit dem Motor abbremsen. Der Geschwindigkeitsverlust ist gar nicht so klein und kann sogar 2 Meter pro Sekunde betragen! Viele der erfahrenen Biker, auch wenn die Situation dies nicht erfordert, betätigen nur leicht den Bremshebel, wenn sie vom Gas gehen, einfach nur deswegen um über ihren Geschwindigkeitswechsel zu informieren. Und genau hier kommt unser System zum Einsatz, das allein dank seiner eingebauten Beschleunigungssensoren die Bremskräfte erkennt und diese durch das Stopplicht wiedergibt.</span></font></p>

<span style=""color: red;"">Einschalten der Warnblinker</span> (Blinker) während einer Notbremsung. Ungewollte Situationen auf der Fahrbahn, auch von Fahrzeugen die sich hinter uns befinden, sind ein großes Sicherheitsrisiko. Der Fahrer hinter dir kann wohlmöglich den Grund deines Blitzartigen Bremsens nicht erkennen. Es ist deswegen lohnenswert, das er sieht das du stehst!
Neue Autos deuten eine Notbremsung mit den Warnblinkern an. Unser System macht dies genauso, indem es die Blinker einschaltet und diese dann das blinken anfangen, wenn die Bremskraft einen voreingestellten Wert überschreitet.

Ein Motorrad das mit unserem Modul ausgestattet ist, informiert den hinter uns sich befindenden Fahrer viel wirksamer das wir bremsen. Es macht den Fahrer, der sich hinter uns befindet, auf uns aufmerksam da das Stopplicht zuerst 4 bis 5 blinkt und erst dann normal leuchtet. Viele Lehrbücher die sich mit sicherem <br/>
Motorradfahren befassen, beschreiben, dass man zuerst den Bremshebel einigemal leicht betätigen soll bevor man den eigentlichen Bremsvorgang einleitet.</span></font></p>

<span style=""color: red;"">Włączanie światła STOP podczas hamowania silnikiem</span> 
(gdy kierowca nie naciska dźwigni hamulca).<br/>
Konstrukcja motocykla pozwala na osiąganie wielkich przyspieszeń, nieduża masa 
sprawia że hamowanie silnikiem również jest bardzo duże. Osobiście znam kilka 
przypadków gdzie dochodziło do niepotrzebnego niebezpieczeństwa ponieważ 
kierujący samochodem lub motocyklem nie zauważył hamującego pojazdu przed nim. 
Szczególnie w motocyklach, gdzie światło stopu jest uruchamiane czujnikiem na 
dźwigni hamulca, „stop” nie zaświeci się podczas hamowania silnikiem - po 
zamknięciu gazu. Utrata prędkości nie jest wcale mała – opóźnienie bez problemu 
przekracza 2m/s2! Nie jeden z doświadczonych bikerów zamykając gaz odruchowo 
delikatnie pociąga za klamkę – nawet jeśli sytuacja nie wymaga używania hamulca 
– tylko po to aby poinformować o zmianie swojej prędkości. Tutaj z pomocą 
przychodzi nasz moduł, który sam rozpoznaje siłę hamowania i sygnalizuje to za 
pomocą światła ""stop""</span></font></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><font><span style=""line-height: 115%;"">

Motocykl wyposażony w nasz moduł o wiele skuteczniej informuje kierowców

zmiany natężenia światła, układ szybko błyśnie 4-5 razy zanim zaświeci „stop”

Motorcycling is a beautiful hobby,  but motorcyclists are more exposed to be injured in an accident or collision than other road users.
Almost every motorcyclist experienced more or less risky traffic incident...


SAMO - The electronic system which we want to build is plugged into the motorcycle illumination installation and substantially increases the safety of traveling by motorbike!
 

FEATURES.
-
Turning on the stop lights during engine braking 
(when the driver do not press the brake lever).
Motorcycle structure and lightweight allows you to achieve great acceleration, that causes powerful engine braking as well.  There are well known situations where unnecessary danger is caused because neither  car or motorcycle did not notice that vehicle in front of it is braking. Especially in motorcycles where “the stop lights” is activated by sensor in a braking lever. The stop light will not activate during the engine braking – when the throttle grip is released. At that moment the speed loss is huge and could easily reach 2m/s! Quite a lot of experienced motorcyclists instinctively pushes the braking lever gently during engine braking – even if situation do not require – just to announce the speed loss to other vehicles. And this is the moment where SAMO – The Safety Ride Module comes into action. Thanks to the built-in accelerometer our module by itself detects the braking power and automatically signals this activity by using the stop lights.
-
Switching Emergency Lights on (turn lights) during emergency braking. Unexpected situations on the road are very dangerous – also from the vehicles behind us. Driver behind you may not see the cause of your emergency braking, therefore it is very important to warn the driver about this situation as soon as it possible. In brand new cars emergency braking is indicated by emergency lights – our module automatically warns vehicles behind us by flashing turn lights in case of emergency braking if the braking force exceeds a certain value.

-
Increased the STOP signalisation. 
Motorcycle equipped in our module warns drivers about braking much more efficiently. Instead of constant light with no intensity change, our system instantly flashes 4-5 times before the STOP light illuminates continuously.
A lot of “Safe Motorcycle Driving” manuals recommends to push braking lever several times before the proper braking – from now on, our module will do it for us.

-
The ALARM function.If you connect the module to the ignition wire, the simple alarm mode would be turned on. The Alarm turns on automatically a few seconds after turning the ignition switch off. The Module signals alarm with turn lights, stop light and horn caused by motorcycle vibration or inclination –  until the owner switches the ignition to “ACC” position.
-The SOS function.
On the road sometimes we can face some unexpected dangerous situations – collision or glide. It is extremely important to inform other road users about collision instantly. Using turn lights, stop light and klaxon, overturned motorcycle efficiently informs about danger. The signalisation continues until we switch the ignition off, or pull up the motorcycle.


animation

HOW DOES IT WORK? 
The module is based on a 3-axis accelerometer, which transmits information to the processor about position, acceleration, and braking of motorcycle. Software compares the sensor readings and indicates the appropriate behavior of the vehicle using the brake light, turn lights and klaxon.
 

INSTALLATION.

Module installation is very simple. Stick the cover to a flat horizontal surface (such as in the glove recess  under the seat).
- 
Connect the module to the lights wiring, turning lights, battery, ignition - according to the scheme:






- The module is compatible with all motorcycles and LED lights (also bulb lights).
 
WORK TO DO...

Currently, we have a working prototype of the device, but it requires a lot of work and money.

The minimum amount of required components, PCBs, covers are expensive, so we look forward for YOUR help! 
For collected funds we are going to finish the project - the final version will be made in SMD technology - so that the device will miniaturized and reliable!

Motorradfahren ist ein wunderbares Hobby, jedoch sind Motorradfahrer häufiger als anderen Verkehrsteilnehmer Verletzungen bei Unfällen oder Kollisionen ausgesetzt.
Mit Sicherheit hat jeder Motorradfahrer mehr oder weniger risikoreiche Verkehrssituationen erlebt...


Unsere Elektronikeinheit, die wir bauen wollen, verbunden mit der Motorradinstallation, erhöht dank der Beleuchtung unseres Motorrads enorm die Sicherheit wehrend des Reisens!
 

FUNKTIONEN.
-
Einschalten des Stopplichts während des bremsen mit dem Motor 
(wenn der Motorradfahrer die Bremse nicht betätigt).
Das Motorrad erlaubt es, dank seiner Konstruktion, blitzartig zu beschleunigen und die leichte Masse verursachen, dass das abbremsen mit dem Motor ebenfalls sehr stark ist und das Motorrad schnell an Geschwindigkeit verliert. Persönlich war ich Zeuge von einigen Ereignissen bei denen es zu unnötigen Gefahrensituationen gekommen ist, da der Autofahrer bzw. Motorradfahrer das vor ihm stoppende Gefährt nicht bemerkt hat. Vor allem bei Motorrädern, ist das „Stopplicht“ erst dann sichtbar wenn wir den Bremshebel betätigt und nicht wenn wir die Hand vom Gasnehmen und mit dem Motor abbremsen. Der Geschwindigkeitsverlust ist gar nicht so klein und kann sogar 2 Meter pro Sekunde betragen! Viele der erfahrenen Biker, auch wenn die Situation dies nicht erfordert, betätigen nur leicht den Bremshebel, wenn sie vom Gas gehen, einfach nur deswegen um über ihren Geschwindigkeitswechsel zu informieren. Und genau hier kommt unser System zum Einsatz, das allein dank seiner eingebauten Beschleunigungssensoren die Bremskräfte erkennt und diese durch das Stopplicht wiedergibt.



 
-
Einschalten der Warnblinker (Blinker) während einer Notbremsung. Ungewollte Situationen auf der Fahrbahn, auch von Fahrzeugen die sich hinter uns befinden, sind ein großes Sicherheitsrisiko. Der Fahrer hinter dir kann wohlmöglich den Grund deines Blitzartigen Bremsens nicht erkennen. Es ist deswegen lohnenswert, das er sieht das du stehst!
Neue Autos deuten eine Notbremsung mit den Warnblinkern an. Unser System macht dies genauso, indem es die Blinker einschaltet und diese dann das blinken anfangen, wenn die Bremskraft einen voreingestellten Wert überschreitet. 




 
-
Änderung der Art und Weise der Signalisierung des Stopplichts. 
Ein Motorrad das mit unserem Modul ausgestattet ist, informiert den hinter uns sich befindenden Fahrer viel wirksamer das wir bremsen. Es macht den Fahrer, der sich hinter uns befindet, auf uns aufmerksam da das Stopplicht zuerst 4 bis 5 blinkt und erst dann normal leuchtet. Viele Lehrbücher die sich mit sicherem 
Motorradfahren befassen, beschreiben, dass man zuerst den Bremshebel einigemal leicht betätigen soll bevor man den eigentlichen Bremsvorgang einleitet.



 
-
Alarmanlage. Das Gerät kann zusätzlich an die Zündung angeschlossen werden und somit als einfache Alarmanlage dienen. Die Alarmanlage wir automatisch, nach einigen Sekunden, eingeschaltet nachdem wir die Zündung abgeschaltet haben. Jegliche Neigungen oder Vibrationen werden von dem Gerät erkannt und die Alarmanlage aktiviert. Am Motorrad  wird dies durch die Blinker, Beleuchtung sowie der Hupe signalisiert und erst dann ausgeschaltet, wenn der Eigentümer des Motorrads den Schlüssel auf die Position „ACC“ dreht.
-S.O.S. Funktion. Na drodze może nas spotkać również jakieś nieprzyjemne zdarzenie… 
Auf der Straße können wir auf verschiedenen unangenehme Situationen stoßen wie z.B. Kollisionen, ins Rutschen geraten, usw.. Hier ist es wichtig, dass die anderen Verkehrsteilnehmer auf unser umgefallenes Motorrad und uns aufmerksam gemacht werden. Dank der Blinker, der Stoppleuchte sowie der Hupe die angehen, wird auf uns, das umgefallene Motorrad und die Gefahrensituation hingewiesen. Das Motorrad macht auf sich aufmerksam bis die Zündung abgestellt wird oder das Motorrad aufgestellt wird.


> Flash Animation <


WIE FUNKTIONIERT DAS?

Das Modul basiert auf einem Dreiachsenbeschleunigungssensor, der den Prozessor über die Lage, Beschleunigung und das abbremsen des Motorrads informiert. Die integrierte Software vergleicht die durch die Sensoren angegebenen Parametern mit den vorgegebenen und signalisiert es anhand der Stoppleuchte, Blinkern und/oder Hube.
 

Montage.

Das anbringen des Moduls ist kinderleicht.
Man muss das Gehäuse an einer flachen und ebenen Stelle am Motorrad ankleben, z.B. in der Ablage unter dem Sitz und es mit den Kabel der Leuchten, Blinker, Akku und Zündschloss verbinden -  laut Schema:






Das Gerät ist mit allen Motorräder und allen Leuchten wie LED oder klassischen Glühbirnen kompatibel.
 

Was muss getan werden…

Aktuell verfügen wir über einen funktionierenden Prototyp, jedoch verlangt es hier noch  Arbeit sowie Geld…

Alle Bauteile die benötigt werden, PCB Boards und Gehäuse sind recht teuer, deswegen zählen wir auf EURE Hilfe!
Mit dem gesammelten Kapital sind wir in der Lage das Projekt zu Ende zu führen – die finale Version entsteht im SMD Verfahren. Dank dessen wird das Gerät kleiner und absolut zuverlässig!
*Das 
Gerät auf den Bildern ist nur eine Visualisierung.

Seit euch dessen bewusst, dass wenn Ihr unser Projekt unterstützt, Ihr nicht nur Geldspender für ein weiteres Gadget seid, sonder zur Sicherheit für zahlreiche Motorradfahrer beiträgt!

Jazda motocyklem to piękne 
hobby, niestety motocykliści są bardziej narażeni na urazy podczas wypadku, czy 
kolizji niż inni użytkownicy drogi. 
Niemal każdy motocyklista przeżył mniej lub bardziej ryzykowne zdarzenie 
drogowe...

Układ elektroniczny który chcemy zbudować wpięty w instalację motocykla, za 
pomocą fabrycznego oświetlenia znacząco podnosi bezpieczeństwo podróżowania 
motocyklem!
 

FUNKCJE.
-
Włączanie światła STOP podczas hamowania silnikiem 
(gdy kierowca nie naciska dźwigni hamulca).
Konstrukcja motocykla pozwala na osiąganie wielkich przyspieszeń, nieduża masa 
sprawia że hamowanie silnikiem również jest bardzo duże. Osobiście znam kilka 
przypadków gdzie dochodziło do niepotrzebnego niebezpieczeństwa ponieważ 
kierujący samochodem lub motocyklem nie zauważył hamującego pojazdu przed nim. 
Szczególnie w motocyklach, gdzie światło stopu jest uruchamiane czujnikiem na 
dźwigni hamulca, „stop” nie zaświeci się podczas hamowania silnikiem - po 
zamknięciu gazu. Utrata prędkości nie jest wcale mała – opóźnienie bez problemu 
przekracza 2m/s2! Nie jeden z doświadczonych bikerów zamykając gaz odruchowo 
delikatnie pociąga za klamkę – nawet jeśli sytuacja nie wymaga używania hamulca 
– tylko po to aby poinformować o zmianie swojej prędkości. Tutaj z pomocą 
przychodzi nasz moduł, który sam rozpoznaje siłę hamowania i sygnalizuje to za 
pomocą światła ""stop""

-
Włączanie AWARYJNYCH (kierunkowskazy) w momencie 
ostrego hamowania. Nieplanowana sytuacja na drodze to wielkie zagrożenie – 
również ze strony pojazdów znajdujących się za nami. Kierowca za Tobą może nie 
zauważyć powodu Twojego awaryjnego hamowania, warto więc zadbać aby jak 
najszybciej zobaczył że stoisz!
Nowe samochody awaryjne hamowanie sygnalizują światłami awaryjnymi – nasz moduł 
także ostrzeże jadące za nami pojazdy migając kierunkowskazami jeśli siła 
hamowania przekroczy ustaloną wartość.


-
Zmiana sposobu sygnalizowania sygnału światła STOP. 
Motocykl wyposażony w nasz moduł o wiele skuteczniej informuje kierowców 
znajdujących się za nim o hamowaniu. Zamiast, nie jednokrotnie nie dostrzeganej 
zmiany natężenia światła, układ szybko błyśnie 4-5 razy zanim zaświeci „stop” 
światłem ciągłym.
Wiele podręczników opisujących bezpieczną jazdę motocyklem zaleca kilkukrotne 
„kliknięcie”  dźwignią hamulca przed właściwym hamowaniem – od teraz zrobi 
to za nas nasze urządzenie.


-
Funkcja  ALARM. Po opcjonalnemu podłączeniu 
naszego urządzenia do przewodu załączającego zapłon uruchomimy funkcję prostego 
alarmu. Alarm załącza się automatycznie kilka sekund po wyłączeniu zapłonu. 
Moduł sygnalizuje za pomocą kierunkowskazów, światła stop oraz klaksonu drgania 
lub przechylenie motocykla – aż do momentu kiedy właściciel przełączy stacyjkę w 
pozycję „ACC”
-Funkcja 
SOS. Na drodze może nas spotkać również jakieś nieprzyjemne zdarzenie… 
Kolizja, poślizg? Ważne w tedy, aby inni uczestnicy drogi zauważyli nasz 
przewrócony motocykl. Za pomocą kierunkowskazów, światła stop oraz klaksonu 
przewrócony motocykl skutecznie daje znać o zagrożeniu.  Sygnalizacja trwa do 
momentu wyłączenia zapłonu, lub postawienia motocykla.

JAK 
TO DZIAŁA?

pomocą światła stop, kierunkowskazów oraz klaksonu.
 

INSTALACJA.

Instalacja modułu SAMO jest prosta, dzięki załączonej instrukcji każdy może 
zrobić to w kilka minut samodzielnie!
-  
Obudowę przyklejamy do płaskiej poziomej powierzchni (np. w schowku pod 
siedzeniem).
- 
Podłączamy moduł do przewodów lampy, kierunkowskazów, akumulatora, stacyjki – 
według schematu:




Instalacje ułatwiają dołączone do urządzenia 
szybkozłączki:



- Po podłączeniu ustawiamy 
motocykl w pionie i resetujemy moduł za pomocą przycisku ""reset"".
- Moduł jest kompatybilny 
ze wszystkimi motocyklami oraz rodzajami oświetlenia (LED lub zwykłe żarówki).
 
DO 
ZROBIENIA…

Aktualnie posiadamy działający prototyp urządzenia, ale wymaga on jeszcze wiele 
pracy i pieniędzy...

Minimalne ilości potrzebnych podzespołów, płytek PCB, obudów są kosztowne, 
dlatego liczymy na WASZĄ pomoc!
Za 
zebrane fundusze uda nam się dokończyć projekt – ostateczna wersja będzie 
wykonana w technologii SMD - dzięki czemu urządzenie będzie nie wielkich 
rozmiarów oraz niezawodne!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are making a car apps which will create 2000+ jobs per year saves times and money of car owners. Provide all car related services from a platform. Over all it would be all in one car solution. </p>
<ul>
<li>Z Soft Solution Limited is developing this apps and I am Mohammed Imtiaz Zahid the founder of Z Soft Solution Limited. </li>
<li>We are trying to give a solution of existing trend.<p>Existing trends are bellow</p>
<p>For car servicing (wash and other service)Car  owner or driver go to the garage and talk with shop owner or mechanic.  They negotiate for the bill of car service and after fixing the bill mechanic has started to give service. </p>
<p> When a car get stuck on the middle of the road, driver/owner  and local people push the car and fix it in a safe place. Then driver/owner  try to find a garage near the location. </p>

We are making a car apps which will create 2000+ jobs per year saves times and money of car owners. Provide all car related services from a platform. Over all it would be all in one car solution. 

Z Soft Solution Limited is developing this apps and I am Mohammed Imtiaz Zahid the founder of Z Soft Solution Limited. 
We are trying to give a solution of existing trend.Existing trends are bellow
For car servicing (wash and other service)Car  owner or driver go to the garage and talk with shop owner or mechanic.  They negotiate for the bill of car service and after fixing the bill mechanic has started to give service. 
 When a car get stuck on the middle of the road, driver/owner  and local people push the car and fix it in a safe place. Then driver/owner  try to find a garage near the location. 
Some ridesharing app launches in many city. But Still a lot of people use manual rent service for car rent. 
There are lot of car drivers who sit in one place for whole day.  Their car used only in the morning and evening.(in the office time)
For parking a car at day time city dwellers searches for an empty space. 
If someone go another city do not find safe space or garage to put car. 
People who visit another country experience several problems when they reach foreign airport.  So we are just trying to solve this existing trends by creating jobs of freelancers whom are not highly qualified but have a desire of doing something. This apps will even enable people cash deal with freelancers after getting services. 

If you be a part of this apps means you are helping people to find their own job and keep a great contribution of GDP growth. Not only that you are getting financial return from this apps

Furthermore, many car owners rely solely on the word of their mechanic when a check engine light or other problem arises. Truvolo is putting the power of car maintenance into the hands of car owners. Truvolo provides smart alerts and reports that track auto performance for better visibility. We can tell you what that check engine light means.

However, a typical driver still depends on archaic methods such as a check engine light or “a strange sound” when something is wrong with their car. A recent survey shows 75% of car owners use the sticker on the windshield to track routine scheduled maintenance. Furthermore, many car owners rely solely on the word of their mechanic when a check engine light or other problem arises. Truvolo is putting the power of car maintenance into the hands of car owners. Truvolo provides smart alerts and reports that track auto performance for better visibility. We can tell you what that check engine light means. With Truvolo, car owners have real insight into how their car is running and what problems it may be having.
Simplify your life with an easy to use interface



If you are low on fuel, the Truvolo app can point you in the direction of the nearest gas station. Stuck in traffic? Truvolo can help you find an alternative route to your favorite locations. Lost your car in a crowded parking lot? Truvolo can help you find it. Truvolo can also be a business tool for those companies employing fleets of vehicles.
How is Truvolo Different?
Truvolo is the only complete and affordable product for the entire family. Truvolo Drive™ has a very small footprint and we are working hard to make it smaller.
Truvolo offers a modular solution that includes the Truvolo Drive™, a smartphone app, and a robust cloud based big-data platform and API for advanced analytics. Our architecture allows us to ensure that diagnostic data is never lost even when the driver occasionally forgets to take his phone during a trip. Our solution allows you to manage all the cars and drivers in your household using one easy to use interface.
Most importantly, we do not require an additional data usage plan, thereby making us a very affordable solution for a typical family. There are no annual or monthly fees required to continue to use the product.
What is a ""Premium Subscription""?
""I thought with Truvolo there are no monthly data fees, what is premium subscription and why would I pay for it?"" you ask...
With Truvolo your data is always available to you and it will always be free. All of our standard features described here are included with this free version of the app. However, we have a grand vision with a lot of ideas on very cool features that will significantly add value to your daily lives. We are in the process of designing and implementing these features. We plan to introduce some of these new features as part of a premium subscription option. We will launch this option a few months after we deliver Truvolo Drive™ to you. The subscription fees for this option will be announced at the same time.
For all of our Indiegogo supporters, we will include the first six months of this premium subscription for free. This clock will start after the premium features are active. After the six months, you will have the option of continuing with this by paying a small subscription fee or continuing to use all the standard features for free.

<p>The product I like to introduce you through
crowd funding is an energy-saving Multi-Tap which is a result of my great
effort and all my energy. I hope that this product can satisfy a lot of people since
I invested all my passion and energy in it. </p>
<p>If this crowd funding is realized, mass
production will begin to manufacture products directly and, if not, mass

<p>Although I finished developing the
product and manufacturing a test product on my own, I still need some funds for
mass production of this product. I got to plan the Indiegogo Crowd Funding
Project to introduce Insight Power's wattdream to more people and to raise
funds required for mass production of such.</p>
<p>I need at least 200 million won for mass
production of wattdream. All funds raised will be used for mass-producing
wattdream.</p>
<p>If 200 million won is not raised, all
funds will be returned. Mass production cannot be realized without at least 200
million won of funds so it is unfortunate for me to say that I will have to
return your valuable money to you if the funds do not reach that amount.</p>

<p>I will offer people who participate in
this crowd funding wattdream 30% cheaper than the retail price. Since the next
mass production is not scheduled after the closure of this funding, this
funding is a golden opportunity for you to get wattdream cheaper and faster.</p>
<p>Using wattdream at home or office helps
you save electric charges and therefore is great for individuals and also can
preserve global environment since it helps save electricity.</p>

</div></div>","Hello, my name is Jun Byung-sub and I am
the CEO of Insight Power. I have been working as a semiconductor engineer for
over 20 years since I started my career as an engineer at Samsung Electronics.
I generally like machines and making products. 







The product I like to introduce you through
crowd funding is an energy-saving Multi-Tap which is a result of my great
effort and all my energy. I hope that this product can satisfy a lot of people since
I invested all my passion and energy in it. 
If this crowd funding is realized, mass
production will begin to manufacture products directly and, if not, mass
production will be delayed a lot. And I will also have to find other way of
funding for mass production. 




I got to create wattdream because I wanted to find a way to allow every individual to do something to prevent global warming at the end of 2000s where global warming was considered as a serious issue. I had been thinking about small things that each individual can perform to prevent global warming so I came up with this idea and created wattdream.







This is the
detailed introduction of Watt Dream Table. 
On top of the
cable organizing function, the Watt Dream Table is equipped with an on/off
reservation function for the energy saving by regulating time for each outlet. 



The time setup
and remote-controlling function by smart phone can be also used within a
ten-meter radius. If there is a wall, it can be used within 4-5m. 


















- Setting up each plug with schedule(On/off & timer functions of three plugs)
- As its time setup can be done in the unit of minute and day of week, energy can be simply saved suitable for different lifestyle.
- Owing to its Down Timer function, the power can be off within minutes or hours.





- Combining the maximum 24 time setups, the time intervals can be adjusted. 


-  Digital clock on
the front side of the table(Planned)




-  Manual switch









-  Its polished
design goes well with living room and desk. 















  
 

Although I finished developing the
product and manufacturing a test product on my own, I still need some funds for
mass production of this product. I got to plan the Indiegogo Crowd Funding
Project to introduce Insight Power's wattdream to more people and to raise
funds required for mass production of such.
I need at least 200 million won for mass
production of wattdream. All funds raised will be used for mass-producing
wattdream.
If 200 million won is not raised, all
funds will be returned. Mass production cannot be realized without at least 200
million won of funds so it is unfortunate for me to say that I will have to
return your valuable money to you if the funds do not reach that amount.







I will offer people who participate in
this crowd funding wattdream 30% cheaper than the retail price. Since the next
mass production is not scheduled after the closure of this funding, this
funding is a golden opportunity for you to get wattdream cheaper and faster.
Using wattdream at home or office helps
you save electric charges and therefore is great for individuals and also can
preserve global environment since it helps save electricity.


   

I won and am planning to win a number of
awards in Korea. wattdream was selected as one of 500 hit items designated by
the Small and Medium Business Administration and the Small and Medium Company
of the Month Award from Korea Economy which is one of the representative press
in Korea was given to wattdream. And the Small and Medium Business
Administration Director's Award is to be given this summer.
The above description proves that
wattdream has public confidence. The product I have applied for crowd funding

sold successfully and I believe that this product will achieve a huge success
as well. I added consumers' needs and design elements to the former product to

There are no big issues with regard to
the development of wattdream table because the basic concept of wattdream table

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The BoardStoppa is an idea that originates from personal experiences as well as ideas for safety on University Campuses. I am currently a college student Studying Mechanical Engineering at Arizona State University and ride a Penny Board. The idea came to my entrepreneurship group and I when discussing an accident I had gotten into a day before. I had fallen off my board, but the Penny Board rolled away and struck someone in ankle. I felt sorry for the whole situation because there was nothing I could do to prevent it. That's when the idea of a brake system for a board came up; the birth of The BoardStoppa.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We believe the amount of funding we chose would be enough to start production and distribution. For just $12, you can have your very own BoardStoppa accessory. Those who contribute this $12 will become unique owners of our new product. If we cannot reach our fixed funding goal of $1,500 by the designated deadline, your credit card will not be charged. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One big risk for The BoardStoppa is the backing for it. If we don't make our goal, we will not be able to start production. At the moment, there are 3D printed models that are being tested on the boards. So far the stopping distance for this product is better than expected. Challenges for the user can be assembly, which requires a screw driver and proper placement. This product is still being tested and developed as we go along in our design process, but we are confident that The BoardStoppa can be a useful tool for everyday Penny Board riders.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to back us at this time, make sure to share our design with family and friends who would be interested in using our product!</p>

</p><p>Hi!<br/>I am
Laczik István from Hungary. I want present one of my ideas. This is fixCall
System, an emergency call system. <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1161797/files/20150120054340-fixCall_logo_gogo.jpg?1421761420"" src="""" style="""" title=""""/></p>
<p><b><u>FixCall System</u></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>FixCall System</b>
is made up of two parts.<br/>
The first part is an <b>Emergency Appliance</b> with emergency access, which will be installed
at the customer's address. The second part is a <b>database management programme</b>, which is running on the computer of
the centre receiving the emergency call. </p>
<p>The <b>device is </b>a
mobile phone-technology-based emergency equipment.<br/>
In an emergency (e.g.: personal injury, fire,
offence) it is important to notify competent authorities quickly and
effectively. The most important tool for achieving this is the <b>Uniform Emergency Call System</b>,
i.e. the use of emergency access number 112 to be
introduced in Hungary in 2014. The system can be effective if at the place of
an emergency there is an emergency device and a person who will make the call
and has all the necessary information. It may occur that in an emergency there
is no mobile phone, or it has a dead battery or for any other reason it can't
be used. It also often happens that because of a fright, a shock or for any
other reason the caller does not remember the emergency phone number or gives
false or incomplete information about the place of the emergency. Any of these
problems greatly reduces the efficiency of emergency help. </p>
<p>The
major disadvantage of private systems currently
operating is that the call is first received at a despatch centre, and only
then it is transmitted to the emergency telephone system, losing
valuable time with the delay. Another disadvantage is that such a device and
its operation is very expensive, therefore their spread is limited.</p>

The <b>device</b> is designed to decrease or
eliminate these disadvantages, making emergency calls from specific places
fast, easy andreliable. Our further aim is to provide the emergency device at a
reasonable price making it easier for them to spread.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1161814/files/20150120054840-rendszer1_a.jpg?1421761720"" src="""" style="""" title=""""/></p>
<p>The device is able to initiate call with a simple push of
the pre-programmed emergency telephone number 112. Using the built-in
speaker-phone makes it easier to conduct a conversation with the operator.
Energy supply of the <b>device</b> is
continuous due to power supply. </p>
<p>Identification data associated with the installed
<b>device</b> are recorded after
installation in the database management program's database.<br/>

<p><b><u>Data,

<p>In Hungary sudden cardiac death is a leading cause for
deaths. Although mostly affects people with a heart disease, sudden cardiac
death can occur anywhere to anyone, even without a warning signal. After a
circulatory system arrest the lack of oxygen is becoming more and more severe
and our brain has the most severe reaction: after 4 or 5 minutes there is already
irreversible damage. Therefore the only chance for survival is immediate
resuscitation, which cannot be done without early detection and timely
emergency call.</p>
<p>In Hungary, sudden cardiac death takes 70 lives daily, most
of which occur at home or at a public place and takes 26,000 lives annually.
This number can be radically reduced by emergency help arriving in time!
Immediate assistance could result in rescuing the life of 10- 12 people daily. </p>
<p>There
are 42,000 new stroke cases registered in Hungary every
year. Immediately upon detection of the symptoms ambulance must be called since
treatment should be started within 3 hours in order that it will be successful.
In Hungary someone dies due to stroke in every 30 minutes, in Austria it
happens in every one and a half hours. </p>
<p>The number of household accidents is very high in developed
countries, in Hungary the number is at least 250,000 per year. <br/>
Most people die of cardiovascular diseases in Hungary
... While in 1960 about 45,000 people died of heart disorders, in 2012 this
number was almost 65,000. </p>
<p>In Hungary patients delay calling emergency help abnormally
long after detecting the signs of cardiac arrest. It is extremely important
that in the case of a very strong, grabbing chest pain persistent for several

<p></p><p>Hallo!</p>
<p>Ich bin Laczik
István aus Ungarn! Ich möchte eine meiner Ideen vorzustellen. <span>Diese fixCall System, also ein Notrufsystem.</span></p>
<p><b><u>FixCall System</u></b></p>
<p>FixCall System
besteht aus zwei Teilen.</p>
<p>Der erste
Teil ist ein Notrufgerät, das bei dem Anrufer zu finden ist. Das wird fix an
der Adresse des Bestellers installiert. Der andere Teil ist ein
Datenbank-bearbeitendes Programm, das auf dem Computer des Notrufempfängers
läuft.</p>
<p>Das Gerät
funktioniert nach dem Prinzip einer allgemeinen, Mobiltelefon-Technologie.</p>
<p>Bei
Gefahr (z.B.: Verletzungen, Brandfall, Verbrechen) ist es wichtig, dass die
jeweiligen Behörden schnell<span>  und  auf einer optimalen Weise  benachrichtigt werden.  Dabei 
ist das  Benutzen  des Einheitlichen Notrufsystems (Notrufnummer
112), das 2014 auch in Ungarn eingeführt wurde, sehr wichtig. Das System kann
nur dann wirksam sein, wenn vor Ort ein geeignetes Notrufgerät und eine Person,
die den Notruf macht, vorhanden sind. Diese Person muss alle wichtigen
Informationen kennen. Es kann auch passieren, dass es vor Ort kein Handy dabei
ist, oder das Akku leer ist. Es kommt auch sehr oft vor, dass vor Schreck, vor
Schockzustand, die Notrufnummer dem Anrufer nicht einfällt, oder er gibt
falsche Informationen im Bezug auf den Ort der Gefahr. Diese Faktoren sinken die
Wirksamkeit der Rettung enorm.</span></p>
Der
Nachteil des heutzutage existierenden Notrufsystems ist, dass der Anruf zuerst
in einer Zentrale ankommt, und erst dann wird er ins Einheitliche Notrufsystem
weitergeleitet, wodurch wertvolle Zeit verschwendet wird. Ein anderer Nachteil
ist, dass so ein Gerät, sowie dessen Instandhalten sehr teuer ist, so ist das
Verbreiten solcher Geräte begrenzt. Der Zweck des Gerätes ist, von bestimmten
Orten kommende Notrufe schneller, einfacher und sicherer zu machen. Dabei
sollten die bekannten Nachteile zu beheben bzw. minimieren. Ein weiteres Ziel
ist es, dieses System preiswert herzustellen, damit dessen Verbreiten auch
versichert ist.<p>
</p><p>Das Gerät kann auf einen Knopfdruck einen
Anruf anhand der einprogrammierten Nummer 112 zu beginnen.</p>
<p>Durch die eingebaute Lautsprechsystemwird
das Gespräch mit dem Operator vereinfacht. Die Energieversorgung des Gerätes
ist mit Hilfe einer Stromversorgungseinheit ununterbrochen. Zu dem
installierten Gerät gehörende Identifizierungsdaten werden nach dem
Installieren im datenbearbeitenden Programm fixiert.</p>
<p>Wenn der Anruf in der Notrufzentrale
eintrifft, wird die Telefonnummer des Anrufers an den Computer weitergeleitet.
Das datenbearbeitende Programm ruft sofort die im Datenbank zu dieser Telefonnummer
vorhandenen Daten hervor: Name, Adresse, Telefonnummer, GPS-Daten, spezielle Informationen
usw.</p>
Dadurch
bekommt der Operator der Notrufzentrale sofort wichtige Informationen. Er sieht
sofort, dass der Anruf von einem Gerät kommt, das Teil eines „offiziellen""
Netzes ist. Noch vor dem Verbinden sieht er auf dem Bildschirm Daten, die im
Zusammenhang mit der Rettung am wichtigsten sind, und was noch wichtiger ist:
infolge dieses Systems sind diese Daten zuverlässig und richtig.<p>
</p><p>Die Bisherigen beinhalten die
Grundbeschreibung des Gerätes, aber das System hat mehrere Möglichkeiten
seitens des Gerätes, aber auch des datenbearbeitenden Programmes.</p>
<p><b><u>Die Vorteile des fixCall System:</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>Der Anruf ist sehr einfach, kann mit einem
Knopfdruck gestartet werden.<br/>Der meist schockierte, verwirrte Anrufer
muss nicht sehr lange über die Notrufnummer nachdenken.<br/>In der Notrufzentrale sieht man den Namen,
die Adresse, die GPS-Koordinaten des Anrufers, die sofort zu den alarmierten
Einheiten weitergeleitet werden können.<br/>Auf der Seite des Anrufers und des
Empfängers kann wertvolle Zeit gespart werden.<br/>Infolge der ständigen Stromversorgung kann
das Gerät jederzeit benutzt werden.<br/>Es ist billig ausführ- und betriebbar.<br/>Beim Benutzen ist das Risiko eines Fehlanrufes
sehr gering.<br/>Die optional fixierten Stimm- oder
Bilddaten können bei einer eventuellen Untersuchung behilflich sein.<br/>Mithilfe des optional-funktionierenden
Stummalarmes kann bei einem Überfall die Notrufzentrale benachrichtigt werden,
ohne darüber den Überfallers zu informieren.<br/>Anhand der eintreffenden Anrufe können
nützliche Statistiken angefertigt werden.<br/>Das System kann von allen benutzt werden.
(Ämter, Firmen, Privatpersonen)</p>
<p><b><u>Vorteile seitens des Staates:</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>Mithilfe des Systems können Menschenleben
gerettet werden.<br/>Die Zeit bis zur Hilfeleistung wird
gekürzt, so können die Verletzungen, die Sachschäden verringert werden, so
werden die Kosten der Heilung und Wiederherstellung der Schäden minimiert.<br/>Mithilfe der genauen<span>  und zuverlässigen  Daten können die 
Kosten der Patrouilleneinheiten gesunken werden.</span></p>
<p><b><u>Neben den Grunddaten ( mit der Einwilligung des Bestellers):</u></b></p>
<p>Persönliche Daten (Alter, schwere
Krankheiten, lebensrettende Medikamente, Behinderungen usw).<br/>Anzahl der Personen, z.B.: alleinlebende
Rentner, oder die Durchschnittszahl der Besucher eines Instituts.<br/>Stall mit der Zahl der Tiere.<br/>Brandgefahreinstufung.<br/>Vorhanden des Defibrillators.<br/>Spezielle Barrierefreiheit.<br/>Gelagerte gefährliche Stoffe.<br/>usw.
</p><p>Leider ist es nicht zu erwarten, dass sich
das Gerät auf freiwilliger Basis verbreiten wird. Um einen guten Netz
auszubauen, benötigen wir die entsprechenden Maßnahmen seitens der Regierung
und den Ausbau des dazu nötigen rechtlichen Umfeldes. lm Bezug auf die Kosten
kann man mit der Unterstützung der Versicherungen rechnen, ich bin fest
überzeugt davon, dass mit der Hilfe des fixCall System wird die Rettung
rechtzeitig kommen und so kann man die Entschädigungskosten auch verringern.</p>
<p>Wie andere Versicherungsapparate, ist dies
auch nicht kostenlos. Trotzdem glaube ich nicht, dass die Notwendigkeit der
Airbag, des Sicherheitsgürtels oder des Defibrillators von jemandem in Frage gestellt
würde, obwohl sie in der Wirklichkeit nicht so oft benutzt werden.</p>
<p>Was überlegt werden muss: welche Vorteile
und Ersparnisse eine einmalige Investition landesweit hat. Anderseits kann
dieses Gerät den Benutzer vor Sach-und Personenschäden schützen.In Finnland
(Mitglied der EU) wird sofort nach dem Anruf der Aufenthaltsort der jeweiligen
Person festgestellt, danach wird es an den Behörden weitergeleitet.                                                                             <i>(<a href=""http://hvg.hu/itthon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://hvg.hu/itthon</a><i>/20130519_tuzolto_riasztas_kaosz)</i></i></p>
<p>Wie lange dauert so eine Bemessung und wie
genau ist die? Ich denke, die Genauigkeit der Bemessung ist ganz anders an
einem Gebiet, wo die Überspielstationen eher selten vorkommen, wie in einer
Großstadt. Natürlich hilft die 1-Meter-Genauigkeit auch nicht, wenn wir den Ort
des Anrufes auf dem 20. Stock eines Geschäftsviertels suchen. Da bedeuten die
genaue Anschrift, Stock, Türnummer viel mehr.</p>

Diese
Daten (und vieles mehr) können wir mithilfe des fixCall System sofort auf dem
Bildschirm sehen.<br/><p></p><p>
</p><p><b><u>Daten, Statistiken:</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>Der plötzliche Herztod ist in Ungarn eine
leitenden Todesursache. Obwohl er meistens Herzkranken betrifft, muss man
wissen, dass der plötzliche Herztod überall und bei allen- ohne
Warnsignal-vorkommen kann. Durch das fortschreitende Herzversagen wird unser
Gehirn am meisten geschädigt: nach 4-5 Minuten können bleibende Beschädigungen
auftreten. Die einzige Chance fürs Überleben ist, wenn die Wiederbelebung
sofort stattfindet, deren erste Schritte die frühe Wahrnehmung und Hilferufe
sind.</p>
<p>In Ungarn sterben täglich 70 Menschen
infolge eines plötzlichen Herztodes, der meistens zu Hause oder auf der Straße
stattfindet und hat jährlich 26 000 Opfer. Mit der rechtzeitig begonnenen
Hilfeleistung könnte diese Zahl radikal gesunken werden. Die sofortige
Hilfeleistung würde täglich das Leben von 10-12 Menschen bedeuten.</p>
<p>In Ungarn werden jährlich 42 000 neue
Strokefälle (Schlaganfall) registriert. Bei der Wahrnehmung der Symptome muss
sofort ein Rettungswagen gerufen werden, denn die Behandlung muss innerhalb von
drei Stunden begonnen werden, um Erfolg haben zu können. In Ungarn stirbt ein
Mensch infolge des Stroke in jeder halben Stunde, in Osterreich in jeder anderthalb
Stunden. </p>
<p>Die Haushaltsunfälle sind in allen
Industrieländern besonders hoch, in Ungarn passieren jährlich 250 000
Haushaltsunfälle.</p>
<p>Die meisten Menschen sterben infolge von
Herz-und Kreislaufkrankheiten.... 1960 starben 45 000 Menschen an Herzkrankheiten,
2012 war diese Zahl beinahe 65 000.</p>
<p>In Ungarn warten die Leute besonders lange
nach der Wahrnehmung der Symptome eines Herzinfarktes. Besonders wichtig ist
es, dass es zu einem Kranken, der sehr starke, spannende Brustschmerzen hat,
und diese nicht nur ein paar Sekunden, sondern mehrere Minuten lang dauern,
sofort ein Rettungswagen gerufen wird. Die ersten drei Stunden sind am
wichtigsten hinsichtlich der Behandlung und der Rehabilitation!</p>
<p><b><u>Mein Ziel: die Einführung des Systems in einem EU-Land.</u></b></p>
<p>Das Istandhalten Betrieb des fixCall System
ist nur durch die Mitwirkung der Notrufzentrale der Regierung möglich, deshalb
ist unser Ziel, dass wir die Beamteten darauf aufmerksam machen, wie
zuverlässig und billig das System ist. lm Interesse dessen brauchen wir so viel
Unterstützer wie möglich, möglichst aus den EU-Ländern.</p>
<p><b><u>Unterstützung:</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>Zur Einführung des Systems braucht man in
erster Linie nicht viel Geld, sondern sehr viele Unterstützer, so ist der
maximale Unterstützungsbeitrag nur 5 €.</p>
<p><b>Am Ende der Kampagne wird eine „Funders""-
Präsentation angefertigt, wo die Namen der Unterstützer angegeben werden.</b> (<a href=""http://prezi.com/prorryyf6f2j/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy&amp;rc=ex0share"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://prezi.com/prorryyf6f2j/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy&amp;rc=ex0share</a>)</p>

Hi!I am
Laczik István from Hungary. I want present one of my ideas. This is fixCall
System, an emergency call system. 
FixCall System

FixCall System
is made up of two parts.
The first part is an Emergency Appliance with emergency access, which will be installed
at the customer's address. The second part is a database management programme, which is running on the computer of
the centre receiving the emergency call. 
The device is a
mobile phone-technology-based emergency equipment.
In an emergency (e.g.: personal injury, fire,
offence) it is important to notify competent authorities quickly and
effectively. The most important tool for achieving this is the Uniform Emergency Call System,
i.e. the use of emergency access number 112 to be
introduced in Hungary in 2014. The system can be effective if at the place of
an emergency there is an emergency device and a person who will make the call
and has all the necessary information. It may occur that in an emergency there
is no mobile phone, or it has a dead battery or for any other reason it can't
be used. It also often happens that because of a fright, a shock or for any
other reason the caller does not remember the emergency phone number or gives
false or incomplete information about the place of the emergency. Any of these
problems greatly reduces the efficiency of emergency help. 
The
major disadvantage of private systems currently
operating is that the call is first received at a despatch centre, and only
then it is transmitted to the emergency telephone system, losing
valuable time with the delay. Another disadvantage is that such a device and
its operation is very expensive, therefore their spread is limited.

The device is designed to decrease or
eliminate these disadvantages, making emergency calls from specific places
fast, easy andreliable. Our further aim is to provide the emergency device at a
reasonable price making it easier for them to spread.
The device is able to initiate call with a simple push of
the pre-programmed emergency telephone number 112. Using the built-in
speaker-phone makes it easier to conduct a conversation with the operator.
Energy supply of the device is
continuous due to power supply. 
Identification data associated with the installed
device are recorded after
installation in the database management program's database.
In the event of an incoming call, the caller's phone
number will be transferred to the emergency centre's computer. The database
management program will display, within moments, the following data of the
caller: name, address, phone number, GPS data, specific information, etc.

In this way the operator of the emergency centre gets information
immediately. It will be seen immediately that the call is coming from a device,
which is part of an ""official"" network. Even before a connection is
established, all those data are displayed on the screen, which are the most
important for emergency help, and the point is: as a result of system
properties, all information is accurate and reliable.
Beside these basic functions of the device the system
offers a number of other options for both the device and the database management program. 

Advantages of
fixCall System
The call can be started in a very simple way, with a simple
motion (push of a button).
The disturbed, shocked  caller should not have to remember the phone
number.
At the emergency centre the caller's name, address,
telephone number, location of the call with coordinates can be seen immediately
and all data can be forwarded to the emergency unit.
Valuable time can be saved on both the caller's and on the receiver's side.
As a result of continuous power supply it can be used
at any time.
It can be installed and operated at low cost.
The possibility of a false call is minimised.
Recorded audio or image data (optional) may be useful
in the event of a medical examination.
Silent alarm (optional) informs the emergency centre
in case of an attack without the knowledge of the attacker.
Logged incoming calls can help making useful
statistics.
The system can be used by anyone (agencies,
companies, individuals).
Advantages for
State administration
Lives can be saved using the system.
Time until assistance can be reduced greatly, so
personal injury, property damage can be smaller and as a result healing and
recovery cost is lowered.
Accurate and reliable data reduces costs of emergency
units.
Manufacturing and installing the equipment creates
new job opportunities.
In addition to
basic data, information shown can be (with the client's consent) as follows:Personal information (age, serious illness, life-saving drug, disability, etc.
).
Expected number of persons, such as a pensioner
living alone, or in an institution the average number of visitors.
Stable with the number of animals.
Fire hazard classification.On-site defibrillator availability.Special accessibility.
On-site storage of hazardous materials.
etc.
Unfortunately, it cannot be expected that the device will spread widely, therefore government measures and related legal
environment are required for creating an effective network. Insurance companies
can be relied on as sponsor partners as I firmly believe that a call made
through fixCall System results a
timely emergency help, significantly reducing compensation claim amounts.
Naturally, as any other safety device, this is not for
free. Fire extinguishers, air bags, seat belts, or defibrillators are basic
necessity despite the fact that actual use is rare.
The following should be considered: firstly, that a
one-time minor investment has long-term benefits and savings, secondly that the
user is protected from personal or material loss. 
In Finland in the
European Union  ... they start to
identify the place of residence right after the call and transfer it to the
relevant emergency unit. (http://hvg.hu/itthon/20130519_tuzolto_riasztas_...)

Gefahr (z.B.: Verletzungen, Brandfall, Verbrechen) ist es wichtig, dass die
jeweiligen Behörden schnell  und  auf einer optimalen Weise  benachrichtigt werden.  Dabei 
ist das  Benutzen  des Einheitlichen Notrufsystems (Notrufnummer
112), das 2014 auch in Ungarn eingeführt wurde, sehr wichtig. Das System kann
nur dann wirksam sein, wenn vor Ort ein geeignetes Notrufgerät und eine Person,
die den Notruf macht, vorhanden sind. Diese Person muss alle wichtigen
Informationen kennen. Es kann auch passieren, dass es vor Ort kein Handy dabei
ist, oder das Akku leer ist. Es kommt auch sehr oft vor, dass vor Schreck, vor
Schockzustand, die Notrufnummer dem Anrufer nicht einfällt, oder er gibt
falsche Informationen im Bezug auf den Ort der Gefahr. Diese Faktoren sinken die
Wirksamkeit der Rettung enorm.
Der
Nachteil des heutzutage existierenden Notrufsystems ist, dass der Anruf zuerst
in einer Zentrale ankommt, und erst dann wird er ins Einheitliche Notrufsystem
weitergeleitet, wodurch wertvolle Zeit verschwendet wird. Ein anderer Nachteil
ist, dass so ein Gerät, sowie dessen Instandhalten sehr teuer ist, so ist das
Verbreiten solcher Geräte begrenzt. Der Zweck des Gerätes ist, von bestimmten
Orten kommende Notrufe schneller, einfacher und sicherer zu machen. Dabei
sollten die bekannten Nachteile zu beheben bzw. minimieren. Ein weiteres Ziel
ist es, dieses System preiswert herzustellen, damit dessen Verbreiten auch
versichert ist.
Das Gerät kann auf einen Knopfdruck einen
Anruf anhand der einprogrammierten Nummer 112 zu beginnen.
Durch die eingebaute Lautsprechsystemwird
das Gespräch mit dem Operator vereinfacht. Die Energieversorgung des Gerätes
ist mit Hilfe einer Stromversorgungseinheit ununterbrochen. Zu dem
installierten Gerät gehörende Identifizierungsdaten werden nach dem
Installieren im datenbearbeitenden Programm fixiert.
Wenn der Anruf in der Notrufzentrale
eintrifft, wird die Telefonnummer des Anrufers an den Computer weitergeleitet.
Das datenbearbeitende Programm ruft sofort die im Datenbank zu dieser Telefonnummer
vorhandenen Daten hervor: Name, Adresse, Telefonnummer, GPS-Daten, spezielle Informationen
usw.
Dadurch
bekommt der Operator der Notrufzentrale sofort wichtige Informationen. Er sieht
sofort, dass der Anruf von einem Gerät kommt, das Teil eines „offiziellen""
Netzes ist. Noch vor dem Verbinden sieht er auf dem Bildschirm Daten, die im
Zusammenhang mit der Rettung am wichtigsten sind, und was noch wichtiger ist:
infolge dieses Systems sind diese Daten zuverlässig und richtig.
Die Bisherigen beinhalten die
Grundbeschreibung des Gerätes, aber das System hat mehrere Möglichkeiten
seitens des Gerätes, aber auch des datenbearbeitenden Programmes.
Die Vorteile des fixCall System:

Der Anruf ist sehr einfach, kann mit einem
Knopfdruck gestartet werden.Der meist schockierte, verwirrte Anrufer
muss nicht sehr lange über die Notrufnummer nachdenken.In der Notrufzentrale sieht man den Namen,
die Adresse, die GPS-Koordinaten des Anrufers, die sofort zu den alarmierten
Einheiten weitergeleitet werden können.Auf der Seite des Anrufers und des
Empfängers kann wertvolle Zeit gespart werden.Infolge der ständigen Stromversorgung kann
das Gerät jederzeit benutzt werden.Es ist billig ausführ- und betriebbar.Beim Benutzen ist das Risiko eines Fehlanrufes
sehr gering.Die optional fixierten Stimm- oder
Bilddaten können bei einer eventuellen Untersuchung behilflich sein.Mithilfe des optional-funktionierenden
Stummalarmes kann bei einem Überfall die Notrufzentrale benachrichtigt werden,
ohne darüber den Überfallers zu informieren.Anhand der eintreffenden Anrufe können
nützliche Statistiken angefertigt werden.Das System kann von allen benutzt werden.
(Ämter, Firmen, Privatpersonen)
Vorteile seitens des Staates:

Mithilfe des Systems können Menschenleben
gerettet werden.Die Zeit bis zur Hilfeleistung wird
gekürzt, so können die Verletzungen, die Sachschäden verringert werden, so
werden die Kosten der Heilung und Wiederherstellung der Schäden minimiert.Mithilfe der genauen  und zuverlässigen  Daten können die 
Kosten der Patrouilleneinheiten gesunken werden.
Neben den Grunddaten ( mit der Einwilligung des Bestellers):
Persönliche Daten (Alter, schwere
Krankheiten, lebensrettende Medikamente, Behinderungen usw).Anzahl der Personen, z.B.: alleinlebende
Rentner, oder die Durchschnittszahl der Besucher eines Instituts.Stall mit der Zahl der Tiere.Brandgefahreinstufung.Vorhanden des Defibrillators.Spezielle Barrierefreiheit.Gelagerte gefährliche Stoffe.usw.
Leider ist es nicht zu erwarten, dass sich
das Gerät auf freiwilliger Basis verbreiten wird. Um einen guten Netz
auszubauen, benötigen wir die entsprechenden Maßnahmen seitens der Regierung
und den Ausbau des dazu nötigen rechtlichen Umfeldes. lm Bezug auf die Kosten
kann man mit der Unterstützung der Versicherungen rechnen, ich bin fest
überzeugt davon, dass mit der Hilfe des fixCall System wird die Rettung
rechtzeitig kommen und so kann man die Entschädigungskosten auch verringern.
Wie andere Versicherungsapparate, ist dies
auch nicht kostenlos. Trotzdem glaube ich nicht, dass die Notwendigkeit der
Airbag, des Sicherheitsgürtels oder des Defibrillators von jemandem in Frage gestellt
würde, obwohl sie in der Wirklichkeit nicht so oft benutzt werden.
Was überlegt werden muss: welche Vorteile
und Ersparnisse eine einmalige Investition landesweit hat. Anderseits kann
dieses Gerät den Benutzer vor Sach-und Personenschäden schützen.In Finnland
(Mitglied der EU) wird sofort nach dem Anruf der Aufenthaltsort der jeweiligen
Person festgestellt, danach wird es an den Behörden weitergeleitet.                                                                             (http://hvg.hu/itthon/20130519_tuzolto_riasztas_kaosz)
Wie lange dauert so eine Bemessung und wie
genau ist die? Ich denke, die Genauigkeit der Bemessung ist ganz anders an
einem Gebiet, wo die Überspielstationen eher selten vorkommen, wie in einer
Großstadt. Natürlich hilft die 1-Meter-Genauigkeit auch nicht, wenn wir den Ort
des Anrufes auf dem 20. Stock eines Geschäftsviertels suchen. Da bedeuten die
genaue Anschrift, Stock, Türnummer viel mehr.

Diese
Daten (und vieles mehr) können wir mithilfe des fixCall System sofort auf dem
Bildschirm sehen.
Daten, Statistiken:

Der plötzliche Herztod ist in Ungarn eine
leitenden Todesursache. Obwohl er meistens Herzkranken betrifft, muss man
wissen, dass der plötzliche Herztod überall und bei allen- ohne
Warnsignal-vorkommen kann. Durch das fortschreitende Herzversagen wird unser
Gehirn am meisten geschädigt: nach 4-5 Minuten können bleibende Beschädigungen
auftreten. Die einzige Chance fürs Überleben ist, wenn die Wiederbelebung
sofort stattfindet, deren erste Schritte die frühe Wahrnehmung und Hilferufe
sind.
In Ungarn sterben täglich 70 Menschen
infolge eines plötzlichen Herztodes, der meistens zu Hause oder auf der Straße
stattfindet und hat jährlich 26 000 Opfer. Mit der rechtzeitig begonnenen
Hilfeleistung könnte diese Zahl radikal gesunken werden. Die sofortige
Hilfeleistung würde täglich das Leben von 10-12 Menschen bedeuten.
In Ungarn werden jährlich 42 000 neue
Strokefälle (Schlaganfall) registriert. Bei der Wahrnehmung der Symptome muss
sofort ein Rettungswagen gerufen werden, denn die Behandlung muss innerhalb von
drei Stunden begonnen werden, um Erfolg haben zu können. In Ungarn stirbt ein
Mensch infolge des Stroke in jeder halben Stunde, in Osterreich in jeder anderthalb
Stunden. 
Die Haushaltsunfälle sind in allen
Industrieländern besonders hoch, in Ungarn passieren jährlich 250 000
Haushaltsunfälle.
Die meisten Menschen sterben infolge von
Herz-und Kreislaufkrankheiten.... 1960 starben 45 000 Menschen an Herzkrankheiten,
2012 war diese Zahl beinahe 65 000.
In Ungarn warten die Leute besonders lange
nach der Wahrnehmung der Symptome eines Herzinfarktes. Besonders wichtig ist
es, dass es zu einem Kranken, der sehr starke, spannende Brustschmerzen hat,
und diese nicht nur ein paar Sekunden, sondern mehrere Minuten lang dauern,
sofort ein Rettungswagen gerufen wird. Die ersten drei Stunden sind am
wichtigsten hinsichtlich der Behandlung und der Rehabilitation!
Mein Ziel: die Einführung des Systems in einem EU-Land.
Das Istandhalten Betrieb des fixCall System
ist nur durch die Mitwirkung der Notrufzentrale der Regierung möglich, deshalb
ist unser Ziel, dass wir die Beamteten darauf aufmerksam machen, wie
zuverlässig und billig das System ist. lm Interesse dessen brauchen wir so viel
Unterstützer wie möglich, möglichst aus den EU-Ländern.
Unterstützung:

Zur Einführung des Systems braucht man in
erster Linie nicht viel Geld, sondern sehr viele Unterstützer, so ist der
maximale Unterstützungsbeitrag nur 5 €.
Am Ende der Kampagne wird eine „Funders""-
Präsentation angefertigt, wo die Namen der Unterstützer angegeben werden. (http://prezi.com/prorryyf6f2j/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share)
Das gesammelte Geld wird fürs Kaufen von
lebensrettenden Geräten an das Land gespendet, aus dem die meiste Spende gekommen
ist. Beim Unterstützen gib uns bitte das Land an, in dem du lebst!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Brandon L. Thompson. I am a 100% disabled combat veteran and a proud representor of the LGBTQ+ community. I am also a Computer Engineer with over 15 years’ experience. I was raised in Japan for 19 years then spent 12 years living in Europe. I love to travel, sightsee, dance, cook, skydive, jet ski amongst many other things.</p>
<p>The reason I started this journey of creating the SATCR device is because it will address a few issues all at once including maintenance cost, roadside assistance cost and wait time to name a few. I have noticed that most vehicles come with a jack and spare tire for unfortunate circumstances like a flat tire while you are traveling. Although in the past this proved to be sufficient, it is time, we update this feature with the technology we currently have available in today’s world. Most of the jacks in your everyday vehicle are a heavy piece of metal that is not always the easiest to lift or the most user friendly to operate.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello,
My name is Brandon L. Thompson. I am a 100% disabled combat veteran and a proud representor of the LGBTQ+ community. I am also a Computer Engineer with over 15 years’ experience. I was raised in Japan for 19 years then spent 12 years living in Europe. I love to travel, sightsee, dance, cook, skydive, jet ski amongst many other things.
The reason I started this journey of creating the SATCR device is because it will address a few issues all at once including maintenance cost, roadside assistance cost and wait time to name a few. I have noticed that most vehicles come with a jack and spare tire for unfortunate circumstances like a flat tire while you are traveling. Although in the past this proved to be sufficient, it is time, we update this feature with the technology we currently have available in today’s world. Most of the jacks in your everyday vehicle are a heavy piece of metal that is not always the easiest to lift or the most user friendly to operate.

What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:

Currently, I'm looking for $25K. This money will go towards the completion cost of the SATCR Robot and fees associated with it's contract.
I'm willing to not only give equity in my company I'm also willing to provide the first 50 SATCR Devices to people who are willing to help my progression forward and believe in the project.
If I do not reach my entire goal, I will ensure I reach out to everyone who donated to see if they want their refund or they still want to support and keep pushing with me.

<p>Friends Dhiego W. Bitencourt and Isac Goulart spawned the idea for FLY FREE in 2016 sharing a passion for classic motorcycles and new technology. Their goal was to <strong>produce an electric motorcycle that would look amazing, be fun to ride and would inspire a new generation of riders.</strong> Merging the classic 1950s aesthetics with today's most advanced technologies became their passion as they prototyped their way to success with the FLY FREE SMART series. Dhiego's business sense complemented Isac's sharp eye for design, and FLY FREE was born.</p> <p> </p>

He met Dhiego, a young entrepreneur who had the same passion for the outdoors and the idea to partner on FLY FREE was born. The concept was to <strong>build an electric motorcycle lifestyle brand, based on the freedom that riders in the 1950s embraced</strong>. They chose the classic decoder models as their original inspiration.</p>
<p>They birthed the first model: The SMART DESERT, after many prototypes and labored iterations.</p>
<p><strong>They then chose to produce 3 amazing models,</strong> using the same proven frame, mechanics and battery - knowing so much more could be done. Plus, this would give customers some amazing choices.</p> <h3>Merging the Past and Present</h3> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551141967/wwdpbjgfkpjj8azk39rl.png"" src=""""/><p><strong>Leveraging proven technologies with a state-of-the-art electric drive train</strong>, we could make a motorcycle that was easily maintained and could be driven for years to come, without the need for fossil fuels and all of the complexities and environmental burdens that come with it.</p>

We've drawn from this ethos to give you the FLY FREE DESERT. From the identifying crossbeam on the handlebars to the sculpted tank, minimal feel, and sleek seat - the FLY FREE DESERT delivers on comfort plus utility and will take you places you have never been before. Coupled with our optional Surf/Snow &amp; Skate supports - your modes of transportation and fun will never be limited.<br/><strong> <br/>We've injected ample research and development into this design,</strong> from mainstream media to real motorcycle culture, and it shows. We used the Triumph Bonneville's Scrambler ""Desert Sled"" as our inspiration. In 1963, this motorcycle was featured as a desert racer, from the iconic 1971 film ""On Any Sunday"". If you love motorcycles, we recommend watching this nostalgic film.</p>

<p><br/><strong>Based on the Japanese Brat Style and Café Racers models, we gave birth to the SMART OLD-STYLE and the SMART CLASSIC, respectively.</strong> Both of these models have a streamlined, cleaner look. Non-essential parts are purposely stripped away, giving the rider a powerful, yet minimal appearance.</p>
<p>This union of styles and simplicity, give the SMART OLD-STYLE a unique presence that has been gathering great recognition from fans all over the world. The unique rider's stance is easily identifiable due to the lower handlebar placement. Your friends won't miss you driving this amazing machine.</p>

<p><br/><strong>More than just a motorcycle type, Cafe Racers represented a deep, counterculture movement.</strong> Here's our definition: a Cafe Racer is a motorcycle that follows a cultural specification, based on unique criteria from this time period.</p>
<p><strong>This movement was spawned with by young Brits who raced on English roads</strong> in the 1950s and 1960s (as a form of escape from the everyday life, with a focus on fun). The starting and ending points of rides were the actual cafes themselves, which became frontier eateries used for meeting up between journeys.</p>
<p><strong>These motorcycles were tailored for higher speeds within short distances,</strong> while the dress code for these rock-n-roller riders was leather jackets with patches. These motorcycles had a design pattern: they were lightweight, had short handlebars and a large fuel tank in front of the seat, giving it a utilitarian spirit, arching the rider into a racing stance. The difference in Cafe Racers was all about performance. <br/><br/><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549912548/rp879kw27pmobys45flf.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Customize Your Color and Seat:</strong></p>

Meet the Team Dhiego & Isac
Friends Dhiego W. Bitencourt and Isac Goulart spawned the idea for FLY FREE in 2016 sharing a passion for classic motorcycles and new technology. Their goal was to produce an electric motorcycle that would look amazing, be fun to ride and would inspire a new generation of riders. Merging the classic 1950s aesthetics with today's most advanced technologies became their passion as they prototyped their way to success with the FLY FREE SMART series. Dhiego's business sense complemented Isac's sharp eye for design, and FLY FREE was born.  
From Real Riders to Real Makers Isac is a young and creative professional who loves off-road motorcycles and surfing. He met Dhiego, a young entrepreneur who had the same passion for the outdoors and the idea to partner on FLY FREE was born. The concept was to build an electric motorcycle lifestyle brand, based on the freedom that riders in the 1950s embraced. They chose the classic decoder models as their original inspiration.
They birthed the first model: The SMART DESERT, after many prototypes and labored iterations.
They then chose to produce 3 amazing models, using the same proven frame, mechanics and battery - knowing so much more could be done. Plus, this would give customers some amazing choices. Merging the Past and Present Leveraging proven technologies with a state-of-the-art electric drive train, we could make a motorcycle that was easily maintained and could be driven for years to come, without the need for fossil fuels and all of the complexities and environmental burdens that come with it.
From Prototyping to Motorcycling The original prototypes were all hand-made, cut and welded until they evolved into a powerful frame that accommodated the best riding dynamics. By strategically placing the battery in a key position, we achieved a planted feel while driving in straight lines and making exciting turns.

A New Generation of Electric Riders

We can put the FLY FREE SMART series into full production with your help, and get these fully styled electric motorcycles into your hands, while developing a new generation of riders who can use a cleaner, simpler and more convenient mode of transportation for decades to come. 
THE SMART DESERT
Go places most motorcycles can't. Freedom, exploration, and independence are staples of the original Scrambler style that made it such a huge hit historically. We've drawn from this ethos to give you the FLY FREE DESERT. From the identifying crossbeam on the handlebars to the sculpted tank, minimal feel, and sleek seat - the FLY FREE DESERT delivers on comfort plus utility and will take you places you have never been before. Coupled with our optional Surf/Snow & Skate supports - your modes of transportation and fun will never be limited. We've injected ample research and development into this design, from mainstream media to real motorcycle culture, and it shows. We used the Triumph Bonneville's Scrambler ""Desert Sled"" as our inspiration. In 1963, this motorcycle was featured as a desert racer, from the iconic 1971 film ""On Any Sunday"". If you love motorcycles, we recommend watching this nostalgic film.

THE SMART OLD-STYLE


Based on the Japanese Brat Style and Café Racers models, we gave birth to the SMART OLD-STYLE and the SMART CLASSIC, respectively. Both of these models have a streamlined, cleaner look. Non-essential parts are purposely stripped away, giving the rider a powerful, yet minimal appearance.
This union of styles and simplicity, give the SMART OLD-STYLE a unique presence that has been gathering great recognition from fans all over the world. The unique rider's stance is easily identifiable due to the lower handlebar placement. Your friends won't miss you driving this amazing machine.
Customize Your Color and Seat:Storage Options/Rear Saddle
 

THE SMART CLASSIC


More than just a motorcycle type, Cafe Racers represented a deep, counterculture movement. Here's our definition: a Cafe Racer is a motorcycle that follows a cultural specification, based on unique criteria from this time period.
This movement was spawned with by young Brits who raced on English roads in the 1950s and 1960s (as a form of escape from the everyday life, with a focus on fun). The starting and ending points of rides were the actual cafes themselves, which became frontier eateries used for meeting up between journeys.
These motorcycles were tailored for higher speeds within short distances, while the dress code for these rock-n-roller riders was leather jackets with patches. These motorcycles had a design pattern: they were lightweight, had short handlebars and a large fuel tank in front of the seat, giving it a utilitarian spirit, arching the rider into a racing stance. The difference in Cafe Racers was all about performance. Customize Your Color and Seat:

Why Spend Double and Wait for Customization?

Don't spend over $10,000 buying a gas motorcycle and converting it into a Scrambler. When you include all of the time, custom work and freight you're adding on thousands. We've already done the work for you. A FLY FREE SMART DESERT with accessories will cost half of what a comparable gasoline-powered motorcycle will, and that doesn't even include the gas savings over time!

We also furnished a way to keep your smartphone charged. Ask out about our mount as well for even more system feedback.

""Fashion changes, but style endures.""                                            Coco ChanelWe wanted Visiobike to blend futurism and elegance. So we designed our signature frame that contains and hides the electronics and drivetrain. The motor and battery are artfully integrated under the naked carbon fiber skin. We've been developing Visiobike for 2 years, and now it's ready. Biking has evolved! You'll be amazed at the power and sophistication we've integrated into a gorgeous, top quality, user-friendly package. It's still a bike, but a bike that gives you so much more...And to give you a familiar, intuitive interface to all our technical innovations, we made the Visiobike app, where you control everything.""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic""                                                                Arthur C. ClarkeTo link all Visiobike's e-components with your smartphone, it has a custom layer of hardware and software that interfaces with everything; the electric motor, battery, camera, automatic gear system, and GPS/GSM chip are all connected to Visiobike’s in-house chipset. The Visiobike app controls them and receives data via Bluetooth, and displays all the useful information you need.
We iterated our custom electronics board many times to make it future-proof. Using dual mode Bluetooth 2.3 & 4.0 ensures that Visiobike is compatible with virtually every smartphone, now and in future. What's more, we’ll be continuously updating Visiobike’s firmware, with upgrades transmitted OTA (Over The Air), so expect even better performance as time goes by... All this technology, yet your Visiobike experience is as simple as possible! That's smart use of your phone.“Realize that everything connects to everything else.”                                                                  Leonardo da VinciYour phone shares its intelligence with your Visiobike. Connect via Bluetooth and an amazing synergy happens: after you enter your unlock code, the app and Visiobike work together, giving you functionality that you won’t find anywhere else outside of a new high-end car.Run the app, and your phone is Visiobike's dashboard! All the controls and useful ride information you need are right there, firmly docked to the handlebars in front of you.The main screen shows a large, clear speedometer, pedal-assist level selector, battery status, odometer, trip distance, lights control and the lock button.Swipe left for navigation powered by Google maps or Apple maps. Handy whether you're checking traffic on your commute or out exploring...Swipe right for our unique Visiocam rearview screen. Yes, Visiobike has a rear-facing camera under the seat - see behind you on your phone screen! No more risking a swerve or wobble to see behind you. No more blindspot: riding feels so much safer when Visiobike’s got your back :)The GSM/GPS module allows you to keep track of your Visiobike in real time through the app. This is only one of Visiobike's built-in anti theft measures. Great for your peace of mind. Also great if you can't remember where you parked!All your Visiobike data are saved in the cloud - you can check your ride statistics anytime on your mobile or desktop. And in the settings menu you can adjust and tweak a whole load of options for your Visiobike.Check out the demo video of the app in the gallery... For iOS and Android!                                                                      Don't text and ride!Any vehicle you ride in traffic should be as safe as possible, right? Not everywhere has bike lanes (yet), and the street can be dangerous, or at least stressful for cyclists. So over and above the bell, we’ve given Visiobike a much praised suite of safety features that you won’t find on any other bike. Will your bike still be where you left it when you get back? That worry can ruin your day. Not with Visiobike!Calling it unstealable might be tempting fate, so we call it ‘virtually unstealable and you’d be stupid to try’. See why: So Visiobike is linked to your phone even when you are not riding. You have the luxury to completely forget about your parked Visiobike, safe in the knowledge that it's secure, and that you will be notified and can alert the police if anyone tampers with it.We're so confident in our anti theft measures that we're giving all our customers one year's free theft insurance (EU only for now, sorry). ""Don't fight forces, use them.""                         R. Buckminster FullerCarbon fiber is such a futuristic material, and fantastic to look at. It performs better than steel, looks great, and weighs almost nothing.Its strength allowed us to build Visiobike in its signature shape, eliminating the seat tube and packing a huge 50 cell battery, while keeping weight down. ""The less effort, the faster and more powerful you will be.""                                                                                       Bruce LeeVisiobike is what's called a 'pedelec', meaning it has a hybrid drivetrain: the motor assists YOU by multiplying your pedal power. We wanted to keep the rider in the equation - after all, that's what cycling is all about, right?The difference with Visiobike is... more power! Feel it throughout your ride: the acceleration is dramatic, cruising is fast, and you really can practically ignore hills and headwinds. The motor support is always available - you simply choose how much you want or need. Our electronics monitor cadence, torque and speed to match you and supplement your effort. Visiobike senses how you want to ride and smoothly adds its power in harmony with you. What you put into cycling, Visiobike gives you back with interest.How does it feel? Simply awesome!We've noticed that our riders tend to grin a lot, that's the effect: on Visiobike, you feel like a superhuman riding a regular bike.Both of our motor options will surprise and delight you for sure.Choose the 250 Watt motor, and effortlessly get up to 25km/h (16 mph). It takes the grunt out of winds and hills and leaves you exhilarated and sweat free wherever you arrive.The 500 Watt motor goes up to 45 km/h (28 mph). With that much power, Visiobike is a serious beast and even more fun! In the EU, insurance, licence and number plate are required to operate 500 Watt ebikes. We strongly advise you to ride it with great care!Bringing you breakthrough gear technology:GEARS 2.0 - NuVinci N360 is a continuously variable gearbox that offers smooth, seamless shifting with no steps through an infinite number of effective gear ratios from low to high within its wide 360% ratio range. It is virtually maintenance free and shifts even at a stop and under high pedal force which makes it the best possible option for electric bicycles!GEARS 3.0 - NuVinci Harmony adds a small servo motor (the black box in the right pic) that shifts gears automatically every 10 milliseconds. It's controlled by Visiobike's electronics which monitor how you pedal, what's your speed, are you going uphill or downhill to determine the best possible gear ratio at every moment. The end result is velvet smoothness and a hassle free and fun ride!We made this happen thanks to the great relationship with Fallbrook Technologies, inventors of NuVinci. Here's what they say:  „We have made the Harmony source code available to the Visiobike development team, and we are happy to see that Visiobike is the first electric bicycle which no longer needs a shifter.“It's great when such synergy results in such an amazing experience :)""I don't think there's any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success.""                                                                                                   Nikola TeslaFor our first prototype we used sika, a great prototyping material used in the automotive industry, but it’s only good for a few frames. When Visiobike Mk1 came out of that block of sika you can imagine how excited we were!The prototype showed us where and how we needed to revise the design. Turned out we were pretty close first time round. We tweaked some cosmetic aspects and constructed a whole new dropout.After a two months of heavy ride-testing, we went back to drawing board.Confident with the redesign, we were ready to go the hard, expensive route, and make an aluminium mold. The quality of products made from carbon fiber is directly related to the quality and precision of the mold, and aluminium molds are the best. To make it, we took a 350kg (around 770 pounds) chunk of aluminium, and a REALLY big CNC machine, and carved out a perfect negative of Visiobike’s form. We polished it beyond perfection and put it to the test. The result: immaculate, eye-catching carbon fiber frames!""The future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed""                                                                                        William GibsonEvery time you choose cycling over driving you’re reducing congestion, noise and pollution in your local environment, and you're staying fit. Choosing Visiobike over a car gives you the best of both worlds: wind in your hair and power to go further, faster. You're buying into the future of urban transport. In the future, the car is no longer king of our cities. We will reclaim the pavement for the people and cities will be humane and pleasant again.(source: Foster + Partners)Projects like Skycycle, by Foster + Partners in London (above) are how we wish to see city infrastructure evolving. This process has already started. You only have to look at Holland or Denmark to get a sense of the future of urban personal transport.We are all part of the trend, but with Visiobike you're ahead of the curve.As with every hardware product, there are potential problems on the way from concept to finished, delivered product. We have overcome many of these already and have plans to mitigate unexpected contingencies. Development is complete. The money we need to raise is to certify Visiobike, place bulk orders for parts,  and finalise the assembly process.  Shipping scheduled to start for the first 20 Visiobikes is by the end of August. All other Visiobikes will be delivered in order in which they are pledged for.So far, we have developed fantastic relationships with our partners and top quality component manufacturers. Everything is ready for Visiobike to go through the certification process, and for us to place bulk orders. All we're missing to go to production is a little bit of your help!",50.0,0,"1 Campaign

Well, we’ve made a cool product and we want to share and to let everyone to experience it! Also, our entire international team is located in China, world’s leading manufacturer. This has a positive impact on our manufacturing processes in terms of reduced costs, increased speed and better quality.   Motion K11 is one of the most powerful electric longboards in the world. How is it different from other brands? First of all, our board has advanced performance characteristics, yet its price is significantly lower than those of other brands (50% less on average). With K11 you can have endless rides around your city, conquer the hills and commute in a fast&fun way.Secondly, K11 is elastic….yeah, it’s possible! We designed a battery that bends with the board. This gives you a better control over your board and more pleasant rides. Finally, it’s the first board designed specifically for the urban use! K11 gives you an ultimate ability to explore your city in a new, amazing way!  M2 is the best electric shortboard in the world! We are not afraid to claim that because we have a good reason. M2 has two hub motors located inside the wheels and the battery planted inside the deck. So it almost looks like a conventional skateboard (a little bit thicker though), and gives you a 100% control over your ride. With M2 you can turn 360 degrees and even do tricks! On top of that its performance is incredible for a shortboard. 20 km range and 33 km/h maximum speed put M2 in one line with longboards. And in many cases this comparison will be in favour of M2. Being a powerful “machine” it is still small and portable. You can take M2 inside the buildings, for work or lectures and it will never be a burden! MOTION M2 Hub motors are implemented inside the wheels! It makes your ride smoother and, at the same time, allows you to use it as a traditional skateboard. Metal core inside the wheel prevents motors from overheating what increases its useful life. M2's Hub motors imply no limits on your ride, giving you the best skating experience!  

 
5 FACTS ABOUT US:

We are the best example of multicultural team as we come from 4 different countries.
We live and work in Shanghai, China
We used Motion Boards samples on daily basis for the last three months
We believe we reached optimal solutions in terms of characteristics
We believe that we can make your life more convenient and fun


 Our main goal is to combine top performance and affordability, which is not always an easy task. An idea of delivering more for less raised some major challenges throughout the project. We have analysed tens of factories around China to find unique parts, which would meet our quality and price requirements. After months of analysing and testing, we can assure the best quality of both K11 and M2. We have finally determined the most reliable suppliers on the market, who now deliver us excellent parts. At the same time, this approach allows us to keep the price low without cheating on quality. Therefore, we believe that our hard work paid off and we have overcome our biggest challenge successfully. We can ship to any country or region. However, some countries/regions have restrictions on imports of goods, which contain batteries. This may cause the shipping cost to be unreasonably high. Please, contact us directly to check the shipping cost for your country/region.Your boards will be shipped within approximately 45 days after the end of the campaign. Support us on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. If you like what we do, share our page with your friends/followers, leave comments and spread the word. We have created an amazing product for you and we need your support. Thank you! Q: Why are your boards cheaper than those of other brands?A: When designing our boards we emphasised two criteria: performance and affordability. Having high performance characteristics our products cost you twice less on average. There are many reasons for that, however, the most significant one is that our entire team is located in Shanghai China what allows for better productivity, better access to various components and reduced labour costs. Q: Does the reduced price implies reduced quality?A: This is not the case! Our engineers perform comprehensive quality control; therefore, we are fully confident about our products reliability and performance characteristics delivered. Q: How long does it take to produce the eBoards?A: We will start production straight after the campaign will be finished. Depending on the scale production will take from 1 to 2 months. Your boards will be shipped immediately after the quality controlling procedures. Q: What are the package dimensions and weight?A: K11: 1020mm*330mm*170mm; weight of package = 10kg. M2: 725mm*300mm*185mm, weight of package =9.5kg.  Q: What is the shipping price?A: We ship globally! The cost of shipping is $89 to any location. Q: Which model suits me more?A: If you want to experience top performance with high speed and long mileage we would recommend you to purchase K11. If you want a portable, light and convenient board, then M2 will suit you more. Q: Can I ride my board in the rain?A: Our batteries are waterproof. However, if it is a heavy rain there is still a possibility that the battery could be damaged. Therefore, we do not recommend to use your board when it is raining heavily or test its impermeability by throwing it into the water. Q: Do you provide a warranty?A: Yes! Every backer is guaranteed a six-month warranty. Q: Is it easy to learn how to ride?A: It is! If you had bad skateboarding experience before, don’t worry! It is different from a regular skateboard. After one-two weeks of practising you will feel 100% comfortable riding you Motion board. Q: What if it runs out of battery on the middle of the road?A: Not a problem! You are still able to ride it as a regular skateboard. Q. Is safety equipment required?A: Depends on your skills! If you are confident in your abilities, you can go without it. However, we recommend you to use some safety gear (e.g. helmet), especially if you are a beginner. Q. How long does the battery live?A: 1000 cycles of charging and discharging. Q. Do you have special offers for resellers and distributors?A: If you want to order 10+ sets, send us your request via email smm@get-motion.com. We will provide you with reseller offers. Q. What will be the price after the campaign?A: K11: $800  M2: $600 Q. How can I contact you if I have further questions?A: You can reach us via email: smm@get-motion.com",36.0,1,"1 Campaign

It is the all-around solution for any cyclist. You can get a complete system or choose exactly which wheel setup you'd prefer with our a la carte pricing option.</div><br/><h1>Why Arsenal?</h1><p>As competitive cyclists and triathletes, we’re always looking for an edge. Aerodynamic wheels provide that edge, but not without a few key drawbacks. First and foremost, there isn’t one set of aero wheels that is perfect for all conditions. So if you want to be at your best, you need to own a few sets of wheels. You need a lightweight shallow set for climbing, you need a medium depth set for windy days, and you need a super deep set for calm, flat days. And if you’re really serious about your racing, you need a disc wheel as well. But a fleet of wheels like that will cost you five to ten thousand dollars, which is absolutely insane.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433090217/zhwlzlaq7ivd0jp0tklz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h1>What is Arsenal?</h1><p>Arsenal is a modular system that combines the versatility of a fleet of wheels with the cost and convenience of a single wheelset. The heart of Arsenal is the interchangeable Aero Shells. These Aero Shells, which resemble the aerodynamic portion of a traditional aero wheel, feature a magnetic attachment mechanism. This mechanism allows a rider to simply snap the shells onto a shallow-rimmed climbing wheel and instantly convert it to an aerodynamic race wheel.  </p><p>Arsenal will be sold as a complete system, which will include:</p><ul>
<li>a set of lightweight aluminum climbing wheels</li>
<li>a set of 60mm Aero Shells for windy days (front and rear)</li>
<li>a set of 90mm Aero Shells for calm days (front and rear)</li>
<li>a carbon fiber wheel cover for ultimate aerodynamic performance (rear)</li>

This puts the weight at a feathery 1420g without skewers. More importantly, the reliability of DT Swiss hubs, CX-Ray spokes, and a high-quality aluminum rim will ensure high performance for years to come. Furthermore, the braking performance of aluminum will ensure this set of wheels can be used every single day without fear of losing braking power on a rainy day. <br/></p><h1>Weight</h1><p></p><ul>

<h1>Manufacturing</h1>
<p>Deciding on a manufacturer for the carbon fiber Aero Shells was an extensive process. In the end, we chose <a href=""http://www.wolfcomposites.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wolf Composite Solutions</a>, based out of Columbus, Ohio. We chose them for a few key reasons. The first and most important reason is that they make incredibly high quality parts. We know firsthand how difficult it is to make flawless carbon fiber parts, so when we toured their facility (AKA ""the Wolfden"") and saw nothing but perfectly finished parts, we knew we had found someone special. The second reason we chose them is because of their experience with the automotive industry. In terms of the size and the annual volume of the parts, carbon fiber parts for cars are very similar to carbon fiber parts for bikes. Both industries require high-performance parts produced in high volume (as opposed to the aerospace industry that needs much lower volumes).</p>
<p>Each mold for our Aero Shells starts out as a solid block of aluminum. A large CNC milling machine then cuts into the metal, transforming it to the exact shape specified by our CAD drawings. </p>A set of molds consists of a mold for the left side and a mold for the right side. Currently, we have one set of molds for the 60mm shells. Following the campaign we will have Wolf make a set of molds for the 90mm shells. Each set of molds can make one pair (i.e. a left side and a right side) of Aero Shells a day. So making a front and rear set takes two days. That means that with one set of molds we can produce ten complete sets of Arsenal Aero Shells per month. If we surpass our goal by a wide margin then we will invest in additional sets of molds so we can produce the shells fast enough to deliver them by the estimated delivery dates. <br/>

</div></div>","OverviewWe've designed Arsenal to be aerodynamic, durable, and light. It is the all-around solution for any cyclist. You can get a complete system or choose exactly which wheel setup you'd prefer with our a la carte pricing option.Why Arsenal?As competitive cyclists and triathletes, we’re always looking for an edge. Aerodynamic wheels provide that edge, but not without a few key drawbacks. First and foremost, there isn’t one set of aero wheels that is perfect for all conditions. So if you want to be at your best, you need to own a few sets of wheels. You need a lightweight shallow set for climbing, you need a medium depth set for windy days, and you need a super deep set for calm, flat days. And if you’re really serious about your racing, you need a disc wheel as well. But a fleet of wheels like that will cost you five to ten thousand dollars, which is absolutely insane.What is Arsenal?Arsenal is a modular system that combines the versatility of a fleet of wheels with the cost and convenience of a single wheelset. The heart of Arsenal is the interchangeable Aero Shells. These Aero Shells, which resemble the aerodynamic portion of a traditional aero wheel, feature a magnetic attachment mechanism. This mechanism allows a rider to simply snap the shells onto a shallow-rimmed climbing wheel and instantly convert it to an aerodynamic race wheel.  Arsenal will be sold as a complete system, which will include:
a set of lightweight aluminum climbing wheels
a set of 60mm Aero Shells for windy days (front and rear)
a set of 90mm Aero Shells for calm days (front and rear)
a carbon fiber wheel cover for ultimate aerodynamic performance (rear)
SpecificationsThe climbing wheel, which serves as the base wheel for the Aero Shells, will come specced with DT Swiss 240s hubs, a high-end welded aluminum rim, and Sapim CX-Ray spokes. This puts the weight at a feathery 1420g without skewers. More importantly, the reliability of DT Swiss hubs, CX-Ray spokes, and a high-quality aluminum rim will ensure high performance for years to come. Furthermore, the braking performance of aluminum will ensure this set of wheels can be used every single day without fear of losing braking power on a rainy day. Weight

Base climbing wheelset: 1420g (w/o skewers)


Wheelset weight w/ 60mm Aero Shells: 1680g (w/o skewers)


Wheelset weight w/ 90mm Aero Shells: 1780g (w/o skewers)


Rear wheel w/ disc cover weight: 950g (w/o skewers)

For comparison's sake, our 90mm wheels are within 20 grams of the shallower Zipp 808 Firecrest, and our disc wheel is nearly 150 grams lighter than a Zipp Super-9 Carbon Clincher Disc.AerodynamicsModern CFD software paired with high performance cloud computing has allowed us to quickly iterate through hundreds of designs for our Aero Shells. The 60mm Aero Shells have been optimized for the higher yaw angles a rider will see on a windy day, while the 90mm shells have been optimized for the lower yaw angles a rider will see on a calm day. This optimization was based heavily on our research into yaw angles, which showed that yaw angles are much lower than the industry generally assumes.Lower yaw angles mean that frontal area is an important factor in the overall aerodynamics of the wheel. With that in mind, we've decided to avoid jumping on the ""wider is better"" bandwagon. Instead, we've chosen a medium width rim, measuring in at 23.5mm at the brake track. The ideal tire width for this rim is around 23mm, which gives a good balance between aerodynamics, rolling resistance, and comfort.The graph above shows wind 
tunnel results of our 60mm Aero Shells compared to one of our 
competitor's 62mm wheels. The test was done at the A2 wind tunnel. The 
wheels were tested on a bike with everything but the front wheel held

<p><b>We want to challenge
the bicycle industry. We do so by truly innovating the way a bicycle
frame is produced. A
new production process designed with one thing in mind: bring bicycle
production back to the Netherlands. </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The manufacturing of bicycle frames hasn't changed much in the last 100 years. To this day, the welding involved is still done by hand. We set out to change that. </p>
<p>Our innovative production process brings bicycle production in to the 21<sup>st</sup>
century and back to the Netherlands. The highly automated process uses state of the art production techniques commonly used in the car industry . </p>
<p>Producing
in the Netherlands means that we can closely monitor every step of the manufacturing
process, leaving no room for error. </p>
<p>We assemble the best products available. Mokumono
uses a grease-free belt drive,
hydraulic disk brakes and worry-free anti-puncture tires. </p>

<p>Cycling and The Netherlands are synonymous. Almost everybody, even our Prime Minister, uses a bike to get to work, to go shopping, or spend some relaxing hours of leisure time. Cycling has been part of the Dutch culture for centuries.</p>
<p>The first Dutch bicycle factory (Burgers) opened in 1870. At the start of the 19th century, there were more than 30 big bicycle manufactures in The Netherlands, producing 20.000 bicycles per year. It might be hard to imagine, but since then the production of bicycles has hardly changed. Traditionally, a bicycle frame is built by joint welding metal tubes. This is mostly done by hand and therefore labor intensive. </p>
<p>In recent years, all of the big Dutch manufactures have moved their production to cheap labor countries, typically in Southeast Asia, in an attempt to cut costs. That means that in spite of our rich bicycle manufacturing history, bicycles are no longer being produced in The Netherlands. </p>
<p>We believe it is time to reverse those tracks and bring back bicycles production to The Netherlands. Inspired by the way cars are produced, Mokumono frames are made of two sheets of aluminum pressed into form and laser welded together. The European car industry has managed to retain production in several European countries by adapting techniques that lend themselves for automation. By borrowing these techniques, we are able to almost fully automate our production process, significantly lowering labor requirements and thus making it possible to build bicycles in The Netherland again. </p>
<p>The main advantage of producing bicycles in The Netherlands is that it allows us to closely monitor every step of the production process. This means that we can discover and fix potential flaws fast and adequately, making sure that every Mokumono bike is of the highest possible quality.

<p>Over two years ago Mokumono started as the Design Academy Eindhoven graduation project of Bob Schiller under the name Epo. Since the start of the project, three prototypes have been constructed as a result of countless sketches and design iterations. The first two were life-size 3D prints that looked like the real thing but were not strong enough to ride on. The third and final prototype is a fully functional bike. Instead of 3D printing, this prototype is hand-formed out of 7000 grade aluminum, the same material that will be used in the final product. This prototype allows us to test the strength and rigidity of the bike, and to feel how the bike handles.</p>

<p>Next to adjusting and perfecting the design, we have sought and found a very reliable manufacturing partner for the production of our frames. Witte van Moort. <br/>Witte van Moort is a family business that can look back on more than 60 years experience, and that has now become a leading supplier in the field of sheet-metal working. Every day, more than 200 enthusiastic employees are involved in the fabrication of a wide range of products for various branches of industry in the Netherlands and beyond. Over the years, WVM has continued to innovate and modernise. As a consequence, the company operates an extensive fleet of machinery, and makes use of the latest techniques making it the perfect partner for Mokumono. </p>

<p>Of course we still have plenty of steps ahead of us before Mokumono is ready for the mass market. An important first step is crowdfunding. Once we meet our crowdfunding goal, we will have the means to commission the construction of the tools necessary to start production and place orders for the necessary parts at our suppliers. We hope to reach this goal so that we will be able to fulfil your pre-orders and reward your support!</p>

<p><b>The Mokumono team</b> consists of Bob Schiller and his twin brother Tom Schiller. Bob is Mokumono’s founder and graduate from the Design Academy, Eindhoven. Tom is an Environmental and Resources Management graduate from the Vrije University of Amsterdam. Within the team, Bob is the head of design and Tom is responsible for overseeing the production and supply chain.</p>
<p><b>The name Mokumono</b> is a composition of two words that express where we are from and what we make. The first part, Mokum, refers to Amsterdam. With more bicycles than inhabitants, it can be rightfully said that Amsterdam is the cycling capital of the world. In other words the ideal home for a new bicycles brand. The second part of the name, Mono, is an abbreviation of the word monocoque and refers to the construction technique of our frames. A monocoque is a structural approach whereby loads are supported through an object’s external skin without internal strengthening.  </p>

</div>
</div>","We want to challenge
the bicycle industry. We do so by truly innovating the way a bicycle
frame is produced. A
new production process designed with one thing in mind: bring bicycle
production back to the Netherlands. 


The manufacturing of bicycle frames hasn't changed much in the last 100 years. To this day, the welding involved is still done by hand. We set out to change that. 
Our innovative production process brings bicycle production in to the 21st
century and back to the Netherlands. The highly automated process uses state of the art production techniques commonly used in the car industry . 
Producing
in the Netherlands means that we can closely monitor every step of the manufacturing
process, leaving no room for error. 
We assemble the best products available. Mokumono
uses a grease-free belt drive,
hydraulic disk brakes and worry-free anti-puncture tires. 


With Mokumono we focus on creating
bicycles designed for the modern urban cyclist, fast, light and durable. 



























The design of our frame is the outcome of renewing the way bicycle frames are produced. Mokumono frames are made of two sheets of 7000-grade aluminum pressed into form and laser welded together.The production techniques are reflected in the design of the frame. The edge on the outline of the frame visually splits it in half and reflects the way it is put together.

Aluminium is a strong and lightweight material but aluminium bicycles are often classified as a rough ride because of its stiffness. To allow some flexing for a more comfortable ride we designed the frame with cantilever rear stays instead of the traditional triangle shape. Making sure that our strong and lightweight frame offers a smooth ride.






Fender and rack mounts are part every frame to make sure that you can ride your Mokumono through puddles without getting wet. Fenders will come as an option to be purchased after the campaign. 






The internal brake cable routing hides the brake cables from view but more importantly from the environment. With the cables inside the frame they are less susceptible to damages and therefore have a longer life span.










Our choices of components reflect a selection of the best products available. For us that means a combination of usability and durability. We are looking for components that are comfortable and low in maintenance. All components of Mokumono must have a long life span and offer exceptional performance in all weather conditions. 
The Gates Carbon Belt Drive System is designed to be a stronger, quieter alternative to the traditional bike chain. The durable carbon-fiber belt is grease-free and requires little to no maintenance. It won’t leave any marks on your pants and you’ll never have to pull over to fix a dropped chain.






The Shimano 105 grade hydraulic flat mount road disk brakes bring high performance stopping power. These brakes use a mineral oil reservoir housed in a compact and ergonomic mechanical lever. Heat dispersing pads combined with Shimano’s ICE technology rotors allow for consistent braking performance through all weather conditions.






The Brooks Cambium C17 saddle is made from vulcanized natural rubber and organic cotton top that offers extraordinary comfort and exceptional freedom of movement, The hard-wearing top, die-cast aluminum structure, and tubular steel rails allow the Cambium to stand up to many years of hard use. Furthermore, a distinct dampening effect is delivered by the classic Brooks “hammock” construction, reducing road vibrations and keeping the rider comfortably in the saddle.






The 32mm wide Continental Grand Prix 4season are robust all-season tires with worry-free puncture protection optimized for cold and wet weather. They are made in Germany, have great lifespan and are by many considered to be the top of the line all-season road bike tires.






The optional Shimano Alfine 8-speed hub strengths are rapidity, silent shifting and is practically maintenance free. The hub basically replaces an 8-speed cassette in a 12-38-tooth configuration. 






The optional Curana C-lite fenders are made from aluminium and extremely light yet very durable. 
The fenders will come as an option to be purchased after the campaign. 










Our prototype is white but the Mokumono will be available in four colors: gloss white, matt black, a deep metallic blue and a deep metallic red. All colors come with a gloss black seat tube. You will be able to choose your desired color after the campaign.

This prototype allows us to test the strength and rigidity of the bike, and to feel how the bike handles.



The final prototype being made.



Next to adjusting and perfecting the design, we have sought and found a very reliable manufacturing partner for the production of our frames. Witte van Moort. Witte van Moort is a family business that can look back on more than 60 years experience, and that has now become a leading supplier in the field of sheet-metal working. Every day, more than 200 enthusiastic employees are involved in the fabrication of a wide range of products for various branches of industry in the Netherlands and beyond. Over the years, WVM has continued to innovate and modernise. As a consequence, the company operates an extensive fleet of machinery, and makes use of the latest techniques making it the perfect partner for Mokumono. 



Our production partner Witte van Moort



Of course we still have plenty of steps ahead of us before Mokumono is ready for the mass market. An important first step is crowdfunding. Once we meet our crowdfunding goal, we will have the means to commission the construction of the tools necessary to start production and place orders for the necessary parts at our suppliers. We hope to reach this goal so that we will be able to fulfil your pre-orders and reward your support!
















All units will be carefully packed and shipped in a custom box with form-fitting high-density foam for maximum protection. All orders will include DHL Post online parcel tracking and insurance. The shipping costs are: The Netherlands: €25 Europe: €50 North America: €150 Rest of world: €200
It is also possible to pick up your Mokumono at our office in Amsterdam, if you decide to do so you will get a full refund of the shipping costs. You will be able to choose this option after the campaign. 
Additional duties/taxes may apply depending on your destination country.






















The Mokumono team consists of Bob Schiller and his twin brother Tom Schiller. Bob is Mokumono’s founder and graduate from the Design Academy, Eindhoven. Tom is an Environmental and Resources Management graduate from the Vrije University of Amsterdam. Within the team, Bob is the head of design and Tom is responsible for overseeing the production and supply chain.
The name Mokumono is a composition of two words that express where we are from and what we make. The first part, Mokum, refers to Amsterdam. With more bicycles than inhabitants, it can be rightfully said that Amsterdam is the cycling capital of the world. In other words the ideal home for a new bicycles brand. The second part of the name, Mono, is an abbreviation of the word monocoque and refers to the construction technique of our frames. A monocoque is a structural approach whereby loads are supported through an object’s external skin without internal strengthening.

<li>Hi, my name is László, and I'm a sheet metal expert with 10+ years of experience in sheet metal production from A to Z, including a 2 year managing director job of a small company. I have driving license for any kind of motorcycle, but I will never ride other motorcycle than the sPereBike, because I want to live for my family, and I want others also not to die in an accident.</li> <li>My personality keeps spinning around improvements, how can I make something better. It comes from deep inside. I'm aware of global warming, I see the huge traffic jams, where people are sitting in cars alone, making it impossible get to the destination, just staying there with engine on. I believe a lot of people don't ride a motorcycle because <b>they are afraid, and they are right!</b> What if somebody else makes a mistake? I'm going to die, or seriously injure and become disabled no matter how much I'm focusing on the road. Or do you already have a fast motorbike, and you (or your wife, kids, parents) aren't affraid? Well you should be. I'm reading always the same story about death cases: <i>""she/he was an experienced driver and was never driving fast""</i>, but after all, she/he is dead. <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">""Per vehicle mile traveled, motorcyclists have a 34-fold higher risk of death in a crash than people driving other types of vehicles.""</i> - says <a href=""http://blog.lib.umn.edu/olso1784/motorcycle/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a source</a>.</li> <li>If you help, a revolution will happen. Much less injuries (one of the greatest causes of human deaths and injuries are traffic crashes - 5th place US 2010), much less traffic jams, so much less air pollution, and: much more fun.</li>
<li>
<b>it's</b> very <b>simple</b>, built of simple, common motorcycle parts, there are absolutely no too complicated components or ideas</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I know real motorcycle enthusiasts don't think like me, but for me, all motorcycles in the whole world are </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">the same</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, no matter if it's a chopper, a speedbike, a crossbike etc. This is completely different, this is completely new, this is the best. The world needs a better solution and this is it!</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I have followed and studied <i>feet forward</i>, or <i>feet first</i>, or <i>recumbent</i> motorcycle projects on the web for years now (not because I wanted a FF or recumbent motorcycle to build, but these were the closest to my idea and I don't think we should call the sPB a FF, because it was not the goal, but only an additional result of the concept), and my conclusion is, that with such proportions and in such composition and with design regarding mostly safety as mine, <b>no other</b> motorcycle exists and more than less approximately this is how a safe and cool looking motorcycle should look like. <u>This is what I would like to see in my and in your garage.</u><br/></span></li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">I need the money to build a professional prototype, get permissions from authorities and promote to catch the attention of a big investor.</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>This way we can show investors, we also have something in our hands. Nobody accepts you if you have just a concept (I know because I have tried it). Investors want to see a product that is working and live up to the expectations. If we want to see a lot of sPereBikes on the roads - and that's what we want - we have to work together with a big fish.<br/>
</li>
<li>First step: buying a used motorcycle with a good and decent engine (not too small, not too big). That would be the most reasonable way.</li>
<li>develop and desing a frame (together with someone who has the right experience), that fits to the engine and all other devices needed.</li>
<li>buy material for the frame and the special component that will allow us to transfer steering and drivetrain.</li>
<li>buy a nice weather resistant sports car seat with seatbelt.</li>
<li>bend and cut the pipes with a CNC tube bender and tube laser</li>
<li>build a welding gauge</li>
<li>weld the pipes together</li>
<li>paint the frame</li>
<li>assemble the whole thing and try how it feels to ride... I guess we have to modify a few things a few times until we get the right results. When we are ready, we look for magazines to ask them to try and publish their (hopefully positive) reviews. When we have enough positive feedback, it will be easier to find large investors to start mass production. Buying a CNC pipe bender for example costs more than 10x than our goal.</li>
<li>we go to exhibitions, and arrange meetings with people, like you</li> <li>If we don't reach the 40.000, the money goes back to contributors.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>
<b>Airbag, and safety belt</b> suddenly begins to make sense <b>on a motorcycle!</b>
</li> <li>We know it will be working, because we have already seen <a href=""http://allamericanracers.com/alligator-motorcycle-dan-gurney-post/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dan Gurney's Alligator</a>, with similar lowered seat position</li>
<li>If you check <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/seatb.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hyperphysics' site</a>, you can see what difference it makes to use a seatbelt.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> A risk can be that the frame becomes too heavy. On one side, weight is good, especially in an accident. Otherwise it results a higher fuel consumption, and maybe becomes hard to handle. We have to find the right material to build the frame.</p> <ul> <li>I have 10+ years experience in producing parts and assemblies of steel including 3D design, CNC programming, bending, welding etc. so it shouldn't be a problem to make it real.</li>
<li>we have to be able to transfer steering and drive. We have to buy or develop and produce custom parts for that, but the good thing is, that more than less these are the two biggest challanges, and they are fortunately not too big.</li>
<li>I have talked to an automotive engineer, who said, for the first sight it doesn't seem too complicated to make real. He said it would be definitely a huge thing if such motorcycle would exist: probably one of his friends would still be able to walk without a stick (he has had a serious leg injury in a motorcycle accident where he was absolutely not driving fast, but a car driver unfortunately hasn't noticed him and turned out in front of him).</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I have a friend nearby, </span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/attila.pecho.1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Attila Pechó</a><span style=""background-color: initial;""> who has also seen my blueprints (in an earlier stage), and he is a professional motorcycle driver, and a </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>professional </b>motorcycle mechanic (he has disassembled, fixed, repaired and assembled hundreds of motorcycles from old to new). He works now in the <a href=""http://www.bama.hu/galerialp/37493"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">motorcycle museum in Olasz</a>, where he is the official restorer of old veteran motorcycles. He is also willing to help make it real.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>We have to get permissions from authorities for our frame and the whole motorcycle completely assembled, otherwise we will not be allowed to start batch production.</li>

Much less injuries (one of the greatest causes of human deaths and injuries are traffic crashes - 5th place US 2010), much less traffic jams, so much less air pollution, and: much more fun.

it's very simple, built of simple, common motorcycle parts, there are absolutely no too complicated components or ideas

I know real motorcycle enthusiasts don't think like me, but for me, all motorcycles in the whole world are the same, no matter if it's a chopper, a speedbike, a crossbike etc. This is completely different, this is completely new, this is the best. The world needs a better solution and this is it!

I have followed and studied feet forward, or feet first, or recumbent motorcycle projects on the web for years now (not because I wanted a FF or recumbent motorcycle to build, but these were the closest to my idea and I don't think we should call the sPB a FF, because it was not the goal, but only an additional result of the concept), and my conclusion is, that with such proportions and in such composition and with design regarding mostly safety as mine, no other motorcycle exists and more than less approximately this is how a safe and cool looking motorcycle should look like. This is what I would like to see in my and in your garage.
   What We Need & What You Get
I need the money to build a professional prototype, get permissions from authorities and promote to catch the attention of a big investor.

This way we can show investors, we also have something in our hands. Nobody accepts you if you have just a concept (I know because I have tried it). Investors want to see a product that is working and live up to the expectations. If we want to see a lot of sPereBikes on the roads - and that's what we want - we have to work together with a big fish.

First step: buying a used motorcycle with a good and decent engine (not too small, not too big). That would be the most reasonable way.
develop and desing a frame (together with someone who has the right experience), that fits to the engine and all other devices needed.
buy material for the frame and the special component that will allow us to transfer steering and drivetrain.
buy a nice weather resistant sports car seat with seatbelt.
bend and cut the pipes with a CNC tube bender and tube laser
build a welding gauge
weld the pipes together
paint the frame
assemble the whole thing and try how it feels to ride... I guess we have to modify a few things a few times until we get the right results. When we are ready, we look for magazines to ask them to try and publish their (hopefully positive) reviews. When we have enough positive feedback, it will be easier to find large investors to start mass production. Buying a CNC pipe bender for example costs more than 10x than our goal.
we go to exhibitions, and arrange meetings with people, like you If we don't reach the 40.000, the money goes back to contributors.    The Impact  
Airbag, and safety belt suddenly begins to make sense on a motorcycle!
 We know it will be working, because we have already seen Dan Gurney's Alligator, with similar lowered seat position
If you check hyperphysics' site, you can see what difference it makes to use a seatbelt.    Risks & Challenges  A risk can be that the frame becomes too heavy. On one side, weight is good, especially in an accident. Otherwise it results a higher fuel consumption, and maybe becomes hard to handle. We have to find the right material to build the frame.  I have 10+ years experience in producing parts and assemblies of steel including 3D design, CNC programming, bending, welding etc. so it shouldn't be a problem to make it real.
we have to be able to transfer steering and drive. We have to buy or develop and produce custom parts for that, but the good thing is, that more than less these are the two biggest challanges, and they are fortunately not too big.
I have talked to an automotive engineer, who said, for the first sight it doesn't seem too complicated to make real. He said it would be definitely a huge thing if such motorcycle would exist: probably one of his friends would still be able to walk without a stick (he has had a serious leg injury in a motorcycle accident where he was absolutely not driving fast, but a car driver unfortunately hasn't noticed him and turned out in front of him).

I have a friend nearby, Attila Pechó who has also seen my blueprints (in an earlier stage), and he is a professional motorcycle driver, and a professional motorcycle mechanic (he has disassembled, fixed, repaired and assembled hundreds of motorcycles from old to new). He works now in the motorcycle museum in Olasz, where he is the official restorer of old veteran motorcycles. He is also willing to help make it real.

We have to get permissions from authorities for our frame and the whole motorcycle completely assembled, otherwise we will not be allowed to start batch production.

<h3>Making A Turn, Not As Easy.</h3>

<h3>Introducing e-kick electric scooter</h3>
<p>We are from <strong>Barcelona</strong>. A new way of living is coming and we have an example in our city with the recent introduction of the first <strong>Smart City Area</strong> in Spain.</p>
<p>We are also committed to the idea of making the city  a nice and peaceful place for its people, promoting social cohesion and citizens’ participation, a place to enjoy life creating  space not only for vehicles but for people, giving the city its  human dimension back.</p>
<p>We implemented all these ideas in one device and today we are proud to introduce <strong>e-kick</strong> <strong>electric scooter</strong>, the new way of moving around the city, quickly, safely and <strong>having fun</strong>, while <strong>reducing noise and emissions</strong> for the <strong>benefit</strong> of all the community.</p>

We are from Barcelona. A new way of living is coming and we have an example in our city with the recent introduction of the first Smart City Area in Spain.
We are also committed to the idea of making the city  a nice and peaceful place for its people, promoting social cohesion and citizens’ participation, a place to enjoy life creating  space not only for vehicles but for people, giving the city its  human dimension back.
We implemented all these ideas in one device and today we are proud to introduce e-kick electric scooter, the new way of moving around the city, quickly, safely and having fun, while reducing noise and emissions for the benefit of all the community.

Why get e-kick?
For travellers (Visit a City in a Day)
For those who have limited time to visit the cities when travelling, we offer a one-day ride all around Barcelona visiting all important places such as Monumental, Sagrada Familia, Passeig de Gracia, Diagonal, Plaza Catalunya, Ramblas, Port, etc.

For people who go to work or move around many times within short distance.

For Teachers or Students (Arrive fresh full of energy to the school or universtity)
For those who move frequently within a 10 Km area, this is the best choice.

For Everyone (Who wants to enjoy riding around)
For people that do further distance also can complement it with public or private transportation.

If we did that, we'd have no way to reach our lofty goals of reinventing transportation the way we did, and certainly not in such a minimal package. We're a group of skaters and engineers with a mission: to combine all the best parts of the different e-vehicles and revolutionize the industry with an intuitive, accessible and truly portable way to get around. And we're really proud to finally introduce Blizwheel.  As we ourselves are skaters, we appreciate how much fun it is to roll around on rollerblades. We take the ability to use advanced techniques very seriously, and developed with those capabilities in mind.Wearing it, you can master the advanced techniques of one foot, scissors kick, S-lines, right angle turns and more. Folds and unfolds intuitively and easily. Just turn the foot bar, unfold the heel bar, and put it on. To stow away, just do the opposite and put it in its thin case.The folded  is only 3.1 inch thick, which is the same as the width of IPhone 8 Plus.       Setting up is simple. Just take it out of the bag, unfold it and put it on. Connect the buckles, adjust the binding straps and turn it on. That’s it, you’re ready to roll!Blizwheel's premium kit comes with a finger controlled speed controller. We invented this smooth, intuitive method to control your acceleration and it's a whole lot of fun. The way it works is simple - just to bend your finger to accelerate and straighten your finger to slow down and stop.

 
The finger controls are available in the Pro kit. The other kits come with intuitive handheld controllers.The Dashboard on the controller can show you the current speed, max speed, mileage and remaining battery life.        Built into this stunning casing is some of the most impressive transportation technology to date. Besides the powerful motor, there's the coil, battery pack, sensors, electric speed controller (ESC) and speed sensors. This type of innovation is never easy. In fact, our first seven prototypes failed to deliver the level of performance we wanted. And it took us more than a year to finalize all the relevant technologies and systems into our eighth prototype. Then industrial design elements were added to this finalized prototype V9.4. Now we are ready to deliver a product that works so well, it’s stable, and fun to ride.Not a single inch wasted. All the components fit perfectly into each wheel.  Because of the two split wheels, blizwheel frees up your legs. While riding blizwheel, you can switch from skating to walking in no time. And you can enter the elevator hassle free.  The app takes all the data from your dashboard and displays them on your smartphone. Plus, you can see how you match up against other riders worldwide.   On a basic level, the experience will remind you of rollerblades, and learning to ride it is just as easy. Anyone with experience riding rollerblades, skateboards, unicycles and anything of that nature should be able to have full control in about 20 minutes or practice. If you are totally new to skating, it might take about 2 hours to pick up the basics of how to balance and ride with skates.         The Blizwheel Team consists of members in both the United States and China. Most of us are skaters, and we happen to be engineers and designers, with years of working experiences in Manufacturing, Mechanics, Electronics, Industrial Design, Supply Chain, Software, Project Management and Marketing. We are enthusiasts of innovation as well as skates. We registered companies in both the United States and China. It means we can control our supply chain better and make sure the delivery.

We have some ideas on how this can be done and we need to test them in order to find the right ones.</p><p>We have made very extensive research concerning all aspects of FUBi. Therefore we have a plan on how to go about production FUBi in both aluminum and titanium.</p><p>We have taken some key steps to ensure our engineering success:<br/>1) We have started to form a team of engineers and designers to complement the existing ones.<br/>2) We have set out a plan for testing the FUBi so that it will perform according to our intentions and specifications.</p><p>SUPPLY CHAIN<br/>Many crowd-funding campaigns can encounter problems when taking their prototypes to production.

The FUBi
 patented collapsible frame is the most compact full-sized 
foldable bicycle in the world , that also has an other folding system and that is as fast 
as other full size fold-able bikes. It retains all the functionality of a
 normal bicycle and can be styled with our color customization. 
Bicycles have some pains and disadvantages related to it. Bicycle 
theft, storage, parking and transport. The quest was therefore to find 
new, not before explored, ways to address these pains. All this effort has finally resulted in something very unique namely:Why FUBi?

FUBi is color customize-able. 


FUBi is foldable in two ways. One fast way and one optimally compact way. 



FUBi  is being made of aluminium or titanium



FUBi is an easy “Do-It-Yourself” bicycle kit. 


FUBi is is a bicycle where the ride is far better than most 
foldable bicycles. FUBi is a fast, safe and enjoyable-to-ride, full-sized 
bicycle.


The FUBi color customization
CHOOSE YOUR OWN COLORS AND DESIGN YOUR OWN BIKE!With just 10 colors and 7 individual frame elements in the FUBi frame there are
10 million different combinations to choose from!  With 12 colors, there are over 35 million and with 14 colors, over 105 million combinations!
All
this will make it possible for you to compose your very own, one of
a kind FUBi, unlike any other FUBi or other bicycle in the whole world.
More colors
to choose from and more color choose-able items, like tires, grips and handlebars, will be added in stretch goals
in our campaign.  You will be able to choose from at least 10 colors, like in this example picture, for the 7 different FUBi frame parts. After the funding is completed, you will be able to access our color configurator to complete your perk.

Our crowd funding project: To get FUBi into production
This FUBi project would include several steps.
-Start the production of FUBi. We have taken this vital step seriously and have therefore already established contact with a company that will handle this important part for us.- The process of choosing and/or ordering 
to our specifications the most suitable parts for FUBi, the ones that 
will make FUBi perform well and to stand out.FUBi single speedSome people that use FUBi
FUBi specificationsThe unique FUBi® frame
FUBi will be realized in aluminium  and titanium.  We would be able to achieve the
 low weight, while gaining some unique properties that make it an 
excellent material for bicycle frame construction.
Titanium and aluminium will not rust or corrode. And as an added advantage we can use the 
same methods and procedures we already have developed for steel FUBi.
The titanium FUBi will weigh about 9.5 kg!The Aluminium FUBi will weigh about 11.5kg!With the light materials of choice, all the unique features of FUBi 
will come to their full right, giving a bike that is strong, light and 
durable. The FUBi fast-shift derailleur
 The patented frame of FUBi has its own new derailleur system
The narrow hubs and bearing system of FUBi-50mm (2 inch) wide hubs and identical front and back wheels!-Narrow frame where the wheel bearings are part of the frame (not the hubs) -Uses high quality deep-groove bearing with longer life-span and low rolling-resistance!           FUBi bearing system                          FUBi wheels(left) and normal wheels(right)FUBi SpecsFUBi will be available in two different sizes FUBi 25 and FUBi 27.FUBi 25 geometry specs in mm:FUBi 27 geometry specs in mm:Frame: FUBi collapsible frame consisting of 7 different frame parts, loose free pivots to accommodate folding and an extra diagonal part for stability, quick release on chain-stay /saddle-stay connection and on diagonal stay connection.Weight: Aluminium 11.5kg, Titanium 9.5kgFork: FUBi fork with integrated head-tube.Head-tube: FUBi special and integrated with front fork by the bearing assembly.Bottom bracket: No traditional bottom bracket cassette! The bottom bracket bearings are directly fitted in the frame, with a straight crank axis through.Derailleur: FUBi Fast-Shift derailleur, 7 gears.Saddle:OpenPost:OpenHandlebars: FUBi crossing and dividable handlebar.Brakes: Rim brakes, FUBi H type brake calipers, movable on fork(s) to accommodate different sized rims.Wheels FUBi 27: Rim 622, tire 23-622(700x23C), or rim 584, tire 35-584Wheels FUBi 25: Rim 571, tire 23-571(so called Triathlon size), or rim 559, tire 35-559Hubs: FUBi hubs and without moving parts, M12 R on the right side, M10L on the left side. 36 or 32 spokes.Crank set: Open, 48t or 52t chain ringSpecifications are subject to change. Which isn't a bad thing, as we will be looking for the best workable solutions and parts in order to make FUBi into a really cool experience.Risks and challenges Similar to many crowd funding projects, we face several risks and challenges in undertaking this next step in the evolution of FUBi . The primary risks for us include:ENGINEERINGTo achieve the level of functionality and simplicity in the user experience of FUBi that we have set as a goal, we have still some small engineering challenges we want to have solved in a more functional way. We have some ideas on how this can be done and we need to test them in order to find the right ones.We have made very extensive research concerning all aspects of FUBi. Therefore we have a plan on how to go about production FUBi in both aluminum and titanium.We have taken some key steps to ensure our engineering success:1) We have started to form a team of engineers and designers to complement the existing ones.2) We have set out a plan for testing the FUBi so that it will perform according to our intentions and specifications.SUPPLY CHAINMany crowd-funding campaigns can encounter problems when taking their prototypes to production. This includes issues like finding the right suppliers for the various parts and for the materials needed. Smooth execution is absolutely essential to overcoming such risks.We have taken this vital step seriously and have therefore already established contact with a company that will handle this important part for us. They have through their network, contacts throughout the major regions of major suppliers of quality bicycle parts and related items.",17.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<h2>Agile, fast, smooth and clean</h2>
<p>The steel CroMoly Moov's frames are engineered for great ride quality and a finely tuned balance for handling. In addition to that, we choose the highest quality, low maintenance components possible:  The belt from <strong>Gates Carbon Drive</strong> is virtually maintenance free.  The <strong>Pinion gearbox</strong> is an fully sealed gear system that allows a wide range of gearing with minimal maintenance. Now you decide... (un) expected breakdowns or worry free rides!</p>

<p>The <strong>161</strong> and <strong>213</strong> offer the same wide array of <strong>Pinion</strong> <strong>gearbox</strong> gears, <strong>Gates</strong> Carbon belt Drive, <strong>Magura </strong>disc brakes, and a <strong>cargo-hauling</strong> rack. The main difference is that <strong>213</strong> runs on 20"" front wheel and has a 80cm by 42cm cargo-hauling rack instead of the 50cm by 42cm cargo-hauling rack of the <strong>161</strong>. </p>
<p>Both bikes are coming <strong>muscle powered </strong>(but all Moov frames are <strong>prepared</strong> for the Neodrives<strong> </strong>Modular Drive System with internal cable routing) and are designed to be a platform for commuting, cargo-hauling, on-road (and a bit off-road urban jungle touring) and just riding to your favorite coffee bar. Our bikes features; 6 bottle cage/ or ""whatever"" mounts. (the <strong>mounts</strong> on the down tube (DT), seat tube (ST) and top tube (TT) allow <strong>your business logo/ name</strong> plate placement depending on your needs).</p>

<p>Attention cargo-hauling/ commuting nerds!<strong> Moov's</strong> + <strong>Gates</strong> + <strong>Pinion</strong> + <strong>Neodrives</strong> (pedelec) combine sensational acceleration full loaded or great lightweight advantage in a urban jungle, making the Moov's bikes agile, fast and smooth.</p>

<p><strong>#FasterThanYou (FTY) </strong>Anyone who has ever ridden a Moov can tell you about the FTY moment. It’s a experience where you instantly fall in love with your Moov once you pedal your first stroke. The Pinion gearbox with Gates belt drive feels so good, it’s so powerful to ride,  it'll blow your mind.</p>

<h3>Pinion C1.6 specs</h3>
<p>The C1.6 is a great gearbox for urban and cargo bikes. But matched also perfect with the Pedelec Neodrives rear wheel motor that is speed limited to 25km/h. The reduced range will provide enough gearing for low speed riding.</p>

<p>4130 cromoly is just one variety of steel. The number is a designation of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) that indicates the metal’s components. Basic high-tensile steel is made of iron and a little carbon. By adjusting the amount of carbon and adding small but precise amounts of other metals different properties can be achieved. Adding chromium and molybdenum (cromo, get it?) yields a high strength-to-weight ratio. </p>

<p><strong>Who:</strong> Hi there, we're Tom and Hendrik. Both born in The Netherlands. But back in 2017,  12000 km further, we started Urban Moov from a garage box located in Caballito, Argentina. It wasn't the easiest thing to do, we were faced with challenges and culture differences. But nothing could stop us. We wanted to create the best, low maintenance, belt drive cargo bike possible.  And we did!! Tom, moved back to his playgrounds in the Netherlands. But we both continued to ""moov"" forward and started Urban Moov Europe. Now we are here, with our first campaign and we know we going to have some challenges again. But we're ready to bring you the best geared, belt driven bikes ever.</p>

Agile, fast, smooth and clean
The steel CroMoly Moov's frames are engineered for great ride quality and a finely tuned balance for handling. In addition to that, we choose the highest quality, low maintenance components possible:  The belt from Gates Carbon Drive is virtually maintenance free.  The Pinion gearbox is an fully sealed gear system that allows a wide range of gearing with minimal maintenance. Now you decide... (un) expected breakdowns or worry free rides!
  
 

 

The 161 and 213 offer the same wide array of Pinion gearbox gears, Gates Carbon belt Drive, Magura disc brakes, and a cargo-hauling rack. The main difference is that 213 runs on 20"" front wheel and has a 80cm by 42cm cargo-hauling rack instead of the 50cm by 42cm cargo-hauling rack of the 161. 
Both bikes are coming muscle powered (but all Moov frames are prepared for the Neodrives Modular Drive System with internal cable routing) and are designed to be a platform for commuting, cargo-hauling, on-road (and a bit off-road urban jungle touring) and just riding to your favorite coffee bar. Our bikes features; 6 bottle cage/ or ""whatever"" mounts. (the mounts on the down tube (DT), seat tube (ST) and top tube (TT) allow your business logo/ name plate placement depending on your needs).
 

 
Attention cargo-hauling/ commuting nerds! Moov's + Gates + Pinion + Neodrives (pedelec) combine sensational acceleration full loaded or great lightweight advantage in a urban jungle, making the Moov's bikes agile, fast and smooth.

#FasterThanYou (FTY) Anyone who has ever ridden a Moov can tell you about the FTY moment. It’s a experience where you instantly fall in love with your Moov once you pedal your first stroke. The Pinion gearbox with Gates belt drive feels so good, it’s so powerful to ride,  it'll blow your mind.
 


 


Pinion Gearbox

Our Moov's 161 and 213 are build around the Pinion gearbox  C1.6 and C1.9xr with the new DS2 rotary shifter. That allows seamless shifting, up and down.
The Pinion C-line gearbox are a fully sealed gear system making them unaffected for any events. The only maintenance they need is a oil change every 10,000km or ones a year.  Visit FAQ or http://www.pinion.eu


Who? Christoph Lerman and Michael Schmitz, are the founders of Pinion.

Handmade? Each Pinion gearbox is designed, engineered and hand assembled in Germany. 

The look! There's no denying that bikes built around Pinion's gearbox are nice and clean.

Seamless? Shifting without pedaling, is so cool.

Handling​?  Mounted in the middle of our bikes frames, for a perfect balance.

 

 
 

Pinion C1.6 specs
The C1.6 is a great gearbox for urban and cargo bikes. But matched also perfect with the Pedelec Neodrives rear wheel motor that is speed limited to 25km/h. The reduced range will provide enough gearing for low speed riding.
 
6 gears - 295% range - 24.3 gear steps - 1800g

 
Pinion C1.9 specs
The C1.9xr is a wide range gearbox. Boasting a range till 568% for every urban jungle. The between steps are the same as her smaller sister here above. The larger steps are perfect for the Neodrives rear wheel motor and allowing you to accelerate faster through gears.
 
9 gears - 568% range - 24.3 gear steps - 2000g
 
 

 Gates Carbon Drive
Gates Carbon Drive Belts runs clean, quiet, smooth, light and is strong. Composed of a weather-resistant polyurethane exterior, the advanced high-performance belt features strong, stretch-free carbon fiber tensile cords. The drive system doesn’t require any grease, is lightweight and does not stretch. The belt gives you a long lasting, lower-maintenance drive, and most importantly, an unbelievably awesome ride. Visit FAQ or https://www.gatescarbondrive.com


Clean - Low Maintenance: No oil, no grease stains. It sheds dirt and grime and cleaning with water is easy. Just get on it and ride.

Quiet - Smooth: No chain is no noise. It's so quiet and smooth, that you enjoying every pedal stroke.

Light: Gates Carbon Drive weighs less than a chain drive. Lighter weight means higher performance.

Strong: The instant engagement and smooth feel is unlike anything you've experienced before. You've got to ride it to believe it.

 

 


Made in Germany


Engineering expertise, skill, ability, simplicity, durability, reliability and passion. Made in Germany is more than just an empty saying here. The majority of components and parts that we use for all our bikes are produced in Germany. Our bike parts specs is durable and sensible.....just the sort of value you expect from Urban Moov

Steel is real 
4130 cromoly is just one variety of steel. The number is a designation of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) that indicates the metal’s components. Basic high-tensile steel is made of iron and a little carbon. By adjusting the amount of carbon and adding small but precise amounts of other metals different properties can be achieved. Adding chromium and molybdenum (cromo, get it?) yields a high strength-to-weight ratio. 
 



 
​the Moov 161
Built of 4130 CroMoly steel, heat treated (process in which the metal is brought to a specific temperature and cooled at a controlled rate to realign its atomic structure) and based on the old bakery bikes, The frame is spaced for 135mm hubs, 24"" wheels and compact. The 161 is designed to be a platform for the urban jungle, commuting, and wherever you run into. It’s adept at handling rough, pot-holed streets, grass shortcuts, urban trails or back alleys.
the Moov213
The CroMoly steel 213 being able to carry about 200 pounds (90kg) of cargo. The load weight, and how it’s loaded, will affect the handling somewhat. So, plan on using all the Pinion Gearbox gears, especially as cargo weight increases. This may seem obvious, but as you get comfy with it you’ll use your full range of gears as never before.

Risk Management
We understand that you may be concerned with potential risks of our supply chain due to the Corona virus in the world. Please note: that URBAN MOOV operates globally, with productions partners in Europe, South America and Asia. All partners, did manufactured perfect and running prototypes. So, we think we have you covered. 

We are anyway analyzing continuously any possible risk which could impact our supply chain and the shipments to you, our backers. 
We review continuously all these risks, and define mitigation plans when needed.

​


Shipment, taxes and duties

Pick Up: You are always allowed to pick up your Moov bike at ZERO COST at our office in The Netherlands. The coffee is ready!!
The rest of the perks, we will send your Moov bike delivered to your doorstep. But that will have a cost starting at 100€ euro depending your location.
Prices of perks are reflecting the cost for the perk before taxes, duties and shipment, as these will need to be calculated based on your location prior to delivery. By dealing with this prior to shipping Urban Moov can be ‘delivered duty paid’ (DDP) to most countries. This allows it to clear customs smoothly on arrival which prevents hold-ups and admin charges at the border. You will be contacted prior to shipment to arrange the final balance to ensure your delivery goes as smoothly as possible.

 




What's in the box
Due to the nature of shipping bikes internationally some assembly will be required. The MOOV's arrives partly-assembled. This is one of the ways we kept the cost low.

We offer video instructions to make sure assembly is super easy and takes less than an hour for a first timer, or even in as little as 30 mins you are on your way. 
We also supply tools you need to put your Moov together - (Hex/Allen keys)   
If you don't feel confident with basic assembly, please go to your local bike store. It will take him about 20 min. ( Note: assembly at an additional fee for you)

 

​

 
EUH..... AND STILL NOT DONE
 


Why and who crowd-funding? 
Why: We think we got the best geared, belt driven urban/ cargo bike possible to compete with the big players in the world. With this campaign we want to put our brand name Urban Moov in the market. And see,  if there is a demand for our bikes in the rest of the world.Besides of that, now it's the time to SUPPORT a small business like us, getting a incredible bike and ride.... when the world is a safer place.
Who: Hi there, we're Tom and Hendrik. Both born in The Netherlands. But back in 2017,  12000 km further, we started Urban Moov from a garage box located in Caballito, Argentina. It wasn't the easiest thing to do, we were faced with challenges and culture differences. But nothing could stop us. We wanted to create the best, low maintenance, belt drive cargo bike possible.  And we did!! Tom, moved back to his playgrounds in the Netherlands. But we both continued to ""moov"" forward and started Urban Moov Europe. Now we are here, with our first campaign and we know we going to have some challenges again. But we're ready to bring you the best geared, belt driven bikes ever.

By: Those are our collaborators and we couldn't do this without them. Amy is a very talented dancer, photographer and student of the Fontys Communication School. She loves health and not healthy food, city traveling and sniffing new cultures. Storm is doing International Business School, likes riding (and falling off) bikes, traveling and drinking beer. Bob collects vintage bikes, Vespa's, wines and is an old school bike courier. His biggest passion is; riding in the alps on his vintage bikes and drinking his own collection. 
For: Moov owners are passionate about working, riding or commuting with an Urban Moov bike. Those Moov Ambassadors post and tell stories of their life with a Moov and know the truth about our bikes more than anyone else.  Alban (France) bikepolo player, bike courier and vegan. Manu (Argentina) owner of bmba, bike courier and bike traveler. Santi (Uruguay) social builder, bike and beer lover. We look forward to welcome you, so our Moov community grows!

<h3>What's different about Clickdrive?</h3>
<div>
Clickdrive doesn't work the same way as regular adapters. Rather than limiting you to running a <i>single</i> App on your mobile device, Clickdrive allows you to run <i>many</i> apps simultaneously - on the device, on your mobile, on aftermarket displays and on the cloud. This is the future of connected cars:
</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/352602/files/20140206010919-your_connected_car_600_449.jpg?1391677759"" src="""" style=""margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;""/></p>

A quick comparison with other adapters on the market:

<h3>What's in The Box?</h3>
<p></p>
<div>
Clickdrive does not make calls, play tunes or check your mail. It is designed with one purpose - to connect your car. There is no other device on the market with the same combination of performance, reliability and security. In particular what makes Clickdrive unique:
<ul style=""font-weight: 300; color: rgb(133, 206, 38);"">
<li><span style=""color: #818181;"">Run multiple Driving Apps at the same time</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #818181;"">Connect with Android/iOS/Windows mobile devices</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: #818181;"">Upgradable module - increase storage or add GSM connectivity</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

With the <b>Clickdrive Open API</b>, we've streamlined and simplified the process of connecting to your car so that <i>anyone</i> with basic skills can write a car-connected App using our technology that can outperform virtually anything on the market today.

Clickdrive really started back in 2004 with a sick Fiat Coupe. I'd blown up the engine and wanted to avoid that happening again, thought I'd connect into the engine so I could monitor it properly. Ended up building and publishing the first kit to hack into these cars. 
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
After a few too many years working in banking I wanted to do something I could be passionate about. The great idea was to build great cloud-connected apps for car enthusiasts. But I failed.
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
The problem was the adapters, the physical component that connects with the car. Most existing adapters were slow, leading to unresponsive, laggy apps. Almost none had any real security built in. But the dealbreaker was they all had the same flaw, they only let a single App connect at a time. This was crazy - when is the last time you used a computer that could only run one application at at time?
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<i>The design was fundamentally broken.</i>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
I teamed up with Rishi and went back to the drawing board, taking the same engineering principles you use in high performance trading systems and to build a new platform for connected cars. We designed the hardware and the core software services to make the best design we could, called it Clickdrive.
</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/352604/files/20140206010944-wireframe_ghost_blue_yellow_600.jpg?1391677784"" src="""" style=""margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;""/></p>
<div>
Once we fixed the adapter it was time for the Apps. We made building connected Apps simpler - anyone with basic skills could do it. The problem was that there were too many Apps to build, so we created the Clickdrive Open Platform to allow others to build on this technology.

<div>
The problem we're having is that there are too many good ideas; Too many apps for us to possibly create! So we realised we needed to make Clickdrive an <i>Open</i> Platform. This means developers can use our free SDK to create and share their own apps.

Yes you can buy cheap OBDII adapters - here's why you shouldn't. 

</div>
<p></p>
<div>
The era of Connected Cars is coming. Within a few years you will be able to choose from <i>thousands</i> of car-connected Apps. You can't do this today because the adapters can <b>only run one app at a time</b>. Sometimes you even need to physically swap out the adapter to change Apps. 
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
Most of these adapters have <b>poor performance</b> and generally <b>no effective security</b>, none that we know of can protect you from malicious Apps hacking your car. If you don't think that will be a problem, check out the vid below:
</div>
<p></p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/oqe6S6m73Zw?feature=player_detailpage"" width=""580""></iframe></div>
<p></p>
<div>
At the other end of the spectrum you have locked-down adapters which are usually very expensive and almost impossible to upgrade.
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
We've redesiged car connectivity from the ground up to fix these problems: 
</div>
<p></p>
<ul style=""font-weight: 300; color: rgb(133, 206, 38);"">
<div>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-weight: bold;"">Multiple Apps</span></li>
<span style=""color: #818181;"">Run multiple Apps at the same time not just on Clickdrive but simultaneously on multiple connected devices.
</span>

<p></p>
<div>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-weight: bold;"">Multiple Platforms</span></li>
<span style=""color: #818181;"">
Because Clickdrive has the brains on the device it will be compatible with all major mobile platforms - iPhone, Android, Windows and all major web browsers.
</span>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-weight: bold;"">Multiple Devices</span></li>
<span style=""color: #818181;"">
Clickdrive is designed with an integral WiFi AP so you're not limited to one connection. This allows dedicated gauges, HUDs, external sensors and wearable technology.</span>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-weight: bold;"">Futureproof</span></li>
<span style=""color: #818181;"">
We're packing the best hardware we can into Clickdrive so it can handle whatever we can throw at it. The external module will be upgradeable to add more memory or add new connectivity options - 4G, Zigbee.</span>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-weight: bold;"">Always Connected</span></li>
<span style=""color: #818181;"">
We're designing Clickdrive to have server class reliability. Unlike a smartphone the device is always connected to your car and never runs out of batteries. This enables professional quality apps.</span>

<p></p>
<div>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-weight: bold;"">Secure</span></li>
<span style=""color: #818181;"">
We take security very seriously indeed. Your private data will be encrypted from source to server - only you and those you choose will have any access to it. Equally important; unlike standard adapters Clickdrive's security will protect your car from hackers and malicious apps</span>

<div>You access Clickdrive over WiFi with your smartphone, tablet or even laptop. We've designed it to work with pretty much any device and multiple devices simultaneously. Download the apps you want and access them from within your car or <i>anywhere</i> via our cloud servers.</div>
<p></p>
<div>
It doesn't stop there. We plan for Clickdrive to integrate with dedicated displays, heads-up displays, smart glasses and other wearable technology.
We have other cool ideas that our lawyers won't even let us publish!
</div>
<p></p>
<div><i>We want to disrupt driving and we want all drivers to have access to this technology - not just those fortunate enough to afford high-end marques.</i></div>
<p></p>

But that's the future, let's summarise what we can do now.

<div> This is the <i>Early Access Program</i> - your chance to get in from the very beginning</div>
<p></p>
<div>
It's going to take time to complete the final hardware. Waiting is dull. So we want to give supporters with <b>Android</b> devices something from day one. Equally important - we want supporters to drive the development of the project. 
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
No the lite version will not have the full benefits of the full Clickdrive, and yes it will have some rough edges in the beginning. However, this is your chance in from the start - you guys will be key to driving the evolution of the platform.
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
From a purely pragmatic perspective this work is <i>vital</i> to ensure we have ironed out all the issues with the core software before we ship the final hardware. This process will ensure that the SDK is field tested and vehicle specific issues are addressed earlier rather than later.
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<i>n.b.</i> Early access is released in phases and we will limit each release in order to make sure that we can deliver what we promise. Earlier birds get the earlier worm.

Work to support more vehicles will be an ongoing project however, we want to ensure that the standard apps will work with all the cars above.

<div>
Please bear in mind, some cars will work better than others. Older vehicles with slower protocols will not be as responsive as more modern cars. Whatever the car Clickdrive will automatically optimise the connection in order to provide the best performance for each vehicle.

<li><span style=""color: #818181;"">Backed by our secure Cloud servers</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
Our prototype already supports up to 4 devices on different platforms simultaneously with performance gain of 500% over some commercial adapters. We have good reason to believe the final version will have even more impressive stats.
</div>

<div>
To test out our SDK front to back we have implemented Clicktrack - a secure, real-time GPS tracking app streaming data through our cloud servers.
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
And finally we have completed the Industrial design, initial Mechanical Engineering and Electical Engineering for the Clickdrive adapter. <i>And this is as far as we can go without your help!</i>

The campaign is raising cash to build the hardware. Specifically to cover the non-recurring expenses around commercialising the adapter. 
</div>
<p></p>
<div>

We have self-funded so far but we need the cash for the next step - to get the Clickdrive adapter onto the production line. Designing and producing new hardware requires a <i>lot</i> of capital.
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
The details can be broken down to three main groups: 
</div>

Cars are expensive toys and Clickdrive can help reduce these costs. If you can avoid a single trip to the garage whether it's for a dyno run to check your performance, turning off a check-engine-light or even avoiding a full engine rebuild it's basically paid for itself. If it helps you with your insurance claim it's paid for itself. If it cuts 10% off your fuel bill it will pay for itself in a year.

</div></div>","Clickdrive tracks your car's performance, helps reduce your fuel bills and records a video of your drive to share with your friends.



With your support we can build the revolutionary hardware that can run all these apps and more at the same time



As seen in:




Clickdrive is a new kind of device for Connected Cars that allows you to download and run multiple driving Apps at the same time - with upgradeable hardware and Open API the possibilities are endless. 


We're excited to launch Clickdrive with our Performance Bundle for car enthusiasts:


Custom dashboards with charting and programable safety alerts
Record your track day with our racing overlays
Measure your car's performance, track it over time
Reduce your car's gas bills, know your car's unique fuel consumption profile
Blackbox data recorder, evidence if you get into an accident
Your own personal cloud to store your performance data




Contribute now and share with your friends! 
With your help we can build the dedicated hardware we need to run these apps.


Clickdrive Referral Bonus

To thank you for spreading the word we would like to offer you a free Clickdrive. When your friends order 4 units we will give you yours free!




Just share your personal campaign link with your friends so we can track who referred whom.


What's different about Clickdrive?

Clickdrive doesn't work the same way as regular adapters. Rather than limiting you to running a single App on your mobile device, Clickdrive allows you to run many apps simultaneously - on the device, on your mobile, on aftermarket displays and on the cloud. This is the future of connected cars:



A quick comparison with other adapters on the market:



What's in The Box?


Clickdrive does not make calls, play tunes or check your mail. It is designed with one purpose - to connect your car. There is no other device on the market with the same combination of performance, reliability and security. In particular what makes Clickdrive unique:

Run multiple Driving Apps at the same time
Connect with Android/iOS/Windows mobile devices
Upgradable module - increase storage or add GSM connectivity



With the Clickdrive Open API, we've streamlined and simplified the process of connecting to your car so that anyone with basic skills can write a car-connected App using our technology that can outperform virtually anything on the market today.

How you can help
Today we've built the prototype, core code, demo apps but we need your support (and $$$s) to bring it onto the production line. By pre-ordering Clickdrive or selecting one of the perks you help us take the final step.





We're working on the first bundle of driving apps for enthusiasts - here are the top ones.


Customisable Dashboards

Unlock the hidden data in your car. Display it on your smartphone or tablet or stream it to our cloud servers and access it anywhere. 

Analyse the channels you want, Clickdrive is constantly monitoring your car so you can set safety limits and get alerts if anything starts to go wrong.



Because Clickdrive supports multiple devices simultaneously you can replace your mechanical gauges with reconfigurable electronic ones.



We're working on skinnable retro/futuristic dashboards. Watch this space...


Driving Recorder
Want to record your daily drive or your heroic lap times? How about showing your mates your awesome line?

Use your phone camera and customisable overlays to create epic recordings of your drive, then upload and share




By avoiding 'hard-burning' your driving data into the video you can reconfigure your overlay even after the day!



Fuel Saver

As Clickdrive monitors your car it builds a unique fuel consumption profile. The result: we can tell you exactly how you should drive in order to reduce your fuel bills.





Too heavy with the right foot, going to fast or too slow? With a customised fuel-consumption profile and live feedback you can take your hyper-miling to the next level.

Performance Monitoring

Maybe you're only worried about fuel bills because you just spent all your cash on upgrades. We can measure your car's performance stats without an expensive trip to the Dyno. You can upload your curves to the cloud and compare the history of all the mods you've made, or just show off to your friends.
 



Blackbox data recorder
Unfortunate enough to get into an accident or get pulled over by the police? Back up your claim with your own Blackbox data recorder



You know your position, speed, acceleration, throttle and can prove it was the other guy's fault!



And here's a look at some other Apps that are going to keep us busy in 2014...


Make sure your family are driving safely, receive alerts when they're home
Breakdown assistance with precise location and diagnostic information
Car locator - don't lose your car. Simple


More apps? How about car sharing, carpark space finder, driver safety analysis, navigation maps with live traffic speeds. Got a better idea of your own? Fantastic - you can bring your idea to life with the Open API.




Clickdrive really started back in 2004 with a sick Fiat Coupe. I'd blown up the engine and wanted to avoid that happening again, thought I'd connect into the engine so I could monitor it properly. Ended up building and publishing the first kit to hack into these cars. 



After a few too many years working in banking I wanted to do something I could be passionate about. The great idea was to build great cloud-connected apps for car enthusiasts. But I failed.



The problem was the adapters, the physical component that connects with the car. Most existing adapters were slow, leading to unresponsive, laggy apps. Almost none had any real security built in. But the dealbreaker was they all had the same flaw, they only let a single App connect at a time. This was crazy - when is the last time you used a computer that could only run one application at at time?



The design was fundamentally broken.



I teamed up with Rishi and went back to the drawing board, taking the same engineering principles you use in high performance trading systems and to build a new platform for connected cars. We designed the hardware and the core software services to make the best design we could, called it Clickdrive.



Once we fixed the adapter it was time for the Apps. We made building connected Apps simpler - anyone with basic skills could do it. The problem was that there were too many Apps to build, so we created the Clickdrive Open Platform to allow others to build on this technology. 




The problem we're having is that there are too many good ideas; Too many apps for us to possibly create! So we realised we needed to make Clickdrive an Open Platform. This means developers can use our free SDK to create and share their own apps. 





For developers

We make connecting your apps to cars simple - no need to deal with the complexities of the car protocols and data formats; so you can focus on doing something cool.


Create free or paid apps - we'll support you. This project is too big for one startup - it can only reach it's potential with you guys on board! 





Yes you can buy cheap OBDII adapters - here's why you shouldn't. 




The era of Connected Cars is coming. Within a few years you will be able to choose from thousands of car-connected Apps. You can't do this today because the adapters can only run one app at a time. Sometimes you even need to physically swap out the adapter to change Apps. 



Most of these adapters have poor performance and generally no effective security, none that we know of can protect you from malicious Apps hacking your car. If you don't think that will be a problem, check out the vid below:





At the other end of the spectrum you have locked-down adapters which are usually very expensive and almost impossible to upgrade.



We've redesiged car connectivity from the ground up to fix these problems: 




Multiple Apps
Run multiple Apps at the same time not just on Clickdrive but simultaneously on multiple connected devices.




Multiple Platforms

Because Clickdrive has the brains on the device it will be compatible with all major mobile platforms - iPhone, Android, Windows and all major web browsers.




Multiple Devices

Clickdrive is designed with an integral WiFi AP so you're not limited to one connection. This allows dedicated gauges, HUDs, external sensors and wearable technology.



Futureproof

We're packing the best hardware we can into Clickdrive so it can handle whatever we can throw at it. The external module will be upgradeable to add more memory or add new connectivity options - 4G, Zigbee.



Always Connected

We're designing Clickdrive to have server class reliability. Unlike a smartphone the device is always connected to your car and never runs out of batteries. This enables professional quality apps.



Secure

We take security very seriously indeed. Your private data will be encrypted from source to server - only you and those you choose will have any access to it. Equally important; unlike standard adapters Clickdrive's security will protect your car from hackers and malicious apps



Safety

Clickdrive is one of the very few devices that runs on a secure network - isolating your car from remote hackers. As a second level of security Clickdrive is the ONLY device with a firewall to protect your car from both hackers and malicious apps



Integrated

We design the hardware, the software and the cloud services to work together so we can offer the best performance and the smoothest plug-and-play experience. 






Clickdrive plugs into your car - within the driver's compartment, usually under the steering wheel. 


You access Clickdrive over WiFi with your smartphone, tablet or even laptop. We've designed it to work with pretty much any device and multiple devices simultaneously. Download the apps you want and access them from within your car or anywhere via our cloud servers.


It doesn't stop there. We plan for Clickdrive to integrate with dedicated displays, heads-up displays, smart glasses and other wearable technology.
We have other cool ideas that our lawyers won't even let us publish!


We want to disrupt driving and we want all drivers to have access to this technology - not just those fortunate enough to afford high-end marques.


But that's the future, let's summarise what we can do now.


Works with 95% of cars on the road

Compatible with all major brands of phones, tablets, laptops.

Simple to install. Secure, Fast, Reliable
Open Platform allows developers to create new apps
Core apps to be shipped with the device




 This is the Early Access Program - your chance to get in from the very beginning


It's going to take time to complete the final hardware. Waiting is dull. So we want to give supporters with Android devices something from day one. Equally important - we want supporters to drive the development of the project. 



No the lite version will not have the full benefits of the full Clickdrive, and yes it will have some rough edges in the beginning. However, this is your chance in from the start - you guys will be key to driving the evolution of the platform.



From a purely pragmatic perspective this work is vital to ensure we have ironed out all the issues with the core software before we ship the final hardware. This process will ensure that the SDK is field tested and vehicle specific issues are addressed earlier rather than later.



n.b. Early access is released in phases and we will limit each release in order to make sure that we can deliver what we promise. Earlier birds get the earlier worm.





Clickdrive is not another OBDII adapter, it's what OBDII adapters want to become when they grow up.





We will finalise the specs as late as possible in order to get the latest hardware however, the current minimum specs are as follows:




1Ghz CPU, 512M RAM, 2G Drive


Acelerometer, Compass 


High performance GPS 


WiFi - secure Access Point for your car

Rotating hinge: Fold Clickdrive away from legs when driving. You're welcome.



If the campaign hits it's stretch goals we'll upgrade the hardware too! More details to follow...






Clickdrive relies on the OBDII protocol to connect to your car. There's a lot of information about this on the interweb however, as a guide all cars produced in the following countries from the following dates will be compatible:


Region
Engine
Year of Production



United States
Petrol
1996 Onwards


United States
Diesel
2004 Onwards


Asia (export*)
Petrol
2001 Onwards


Europe
Petrol
2001 Onwards


Europe
Diesel
2004 Onwards


Australia, New Zealand
Petrol/Diesel
2006 Onwards




Work to support more vehicles will be an ongoing project however, we want to ensure that the standard apps will work with all the cars above. 



Please bear in mind, some cars will work better than others. Older vehicles with slower protocols will not be as responsive as more modern cars. Whatever the car Clickdrive will automatically optimise the connection in order to provide the best performance for each vehicle.



* n.b. JDM (Japanese Domestic Market) cars often have limited compatability with OBDII standards - unfortunately support for these models can't be guaranteed. Please contact us for more details.








Coming up to 2 years work on this project here's where we are so far.

Working Clickdrive Prototype
Beta SDK for Web and Android
Demo Web, Android and Desktop Apps
Backed by our secure Cloud servers



Our prototype already supports up to 4 devices on different platforms simultaneously with performance gain of 500% over some commercial adapters. We have good reason to believe the final version will have even more impressive stats.




To test out our SDK front to back we have implemented Clicktrack - a secure, real-time GPS tracking app streaming data through our cloud servers.



And finally we have completed the Industrial design, initial Mechanical Engineering and Electical Engineering for the Clickdrive adapter. And this is as far as we can go without your help!




The campaign is raising cash to build the hardware. Specifically to cover the non-recurring expenses around commercialising the adapter. 




We have self-funded so far but we need the cash for the next step - to get the Clickdrive adapter onto the production line. Designing and producing new hardware requires a lot of capital.



The details can be broken down to three main groups: 


Final engineering to commercialise the adapter
Production tooling costs 
(making the moulds for the casing, 'debugging' the production line)
Material costs for the first production run


This is why we are running an all or nothing campaign! The campaign goal is the minimum amount we need to bring Clickdrive to the market - if we don't raise the target amount we cannot launch.




We know that execution is critical. We know that anyone who pre-orders a product from Indiegogo expects to receive a quality product on the scheduled delivery date.



We also know that bringing new hardware to market is difficult and we will face challenges. We would like to reassure you that we have considered the risks and how to mitigate them


Firstly we have demonstrated that the technology works with a functional prototype. Even at this stage clickdrive can still outperform commercially available hardware!

Secondly we have partnered with award-winning design house We Are Perspective  who bring their expertise in design and manufacture of hi-tech consumer electronics to the project.

Also... we're not exactly fresh out of college and have many years of experience in delivering global, multi-million dollar technology projects. Not to be complacent - each project has it's own challenges which should never be underestimated - but it helps.



Of course our supporters can pre-order an awesome Clickdrive and secure one of the very first units at an amazing discount to the retail price!



And for those that don't drive we have other perks. 

Get your hands on one our exclusive stickers to shamelessly brand your favourite possessions or slow-moving pets.

And don't forget our classy t-shirts designed in a fetching black which is not only slimming but also effectively hides oil and grease stains. 



All our supporters will get a place on our founders page and access to all discussions and project updates!



And please, please help us by spreading the word! Share the campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or your favoure forums. This is really, really important.

Sadly not the lite version at this time. The lite version of Clickdrive is based off an Android app (minimum version Honeycomb). The full version of Clickdrive will of course support Apple devices



Why choose Android for Clickdrive lite?
We're small so we had to choose a single platform for native apps. The brute fact is that there are a lot more 'Droid devices around than Apple devices



How do I know if my Clickdrive works with my car?
Easiest ways is to Google your car make + model + ""OBD""! Please drop us a line and we'll help out.



Do you support Manufacturer's PIDs?
A core part of the Clickdrive Open API is the ability to support non-standard PIDs on a per-vehicle basis. However, cataloging this information is a big project which will almost certainly need help from the community; so we can't promise that there will be much support out of the box from day one.



How well will my car work with Clickdrive?
Much more difficult to find that information. For example, modern cars can provide 200 data updates a second (and much more) while older protocols may produce less than 10 data updates a second. This will affect the responsiveness (latency) of any app and potentially the number of diffferent apps that can operate simultaneously. We are working on compiling a definitive list.



Can I use Clickdrive to tune my car by reflashing my ECU?
We're not planning to support that ability with this version - in particular we don't support the SAE J2534 protocol. However we are looking at the possibility of designing a tuner version of Clickdrive.",51.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>POWER SYSTEMS</h3>
<p>The McFly has<b> two power activation systems</b>. </p>
<p>Primary engagement is pedal assist. Which works by sensing a riders pedaling motion and activating the motors drive train. Perfect for riding in cities and in groups.  </p>
<p>Secondary engagement is the thumb throttle. Simply push down the throttle and and like that your blasting off. Perfect for off-road riding when your focusing more on technical riding and less on pedaling.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>LONGEVITY</h3>
<p>McFly’s direct mid-drive motor <b>increases durability exponentially</b> compared to competing hub motors. The McFly's mid-drive motor powers the drive-train directly, while other hub motors transfer power through the bicycles wheels which stresses the bikes spokes, rims and dropouts.</p>

<h4>Revolutionized Micro Maintenace</h4>A revolutionary style of eBike maintenance, equipping riders with confidence to know we'll be there every step of the way. Bikes break it's a part of life and electric bikes are no exception. The only problem with electric bikes is that there's no way to get them serviced from a local shop. Usually riders are left with two options either tinkering with the problem themselves are spending money on expensive bike shipping fees to and from the electric bike manufacturer.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p>We didn't like either of these ideas and we didn't want to leave our riders stranded with a bike they couldn't ride. So we reverse engineered the problem and decided to revolutionize electric bikes by introducing micro maintenance. </p>
<p>The micro maintenance idea is based off of our plug and play component system. We've integrated the components to easily separate and disassemble from one another, allowing riders to easily remove the faulty component. Riders can then ship the singular  component to our production HQ. Where are experts will fix the kink and ship it right back to the user, for an even easier re-install.</p>

</div></div>","The McFlys' been built to be the fastest most versatile electric bike ever produced.

 Designed for looks. Designed for performance.


We didn't like any electric bike designs offered in the market. So instead of settling we put our manufacturing backgrounds to work and set out to design the best looking, most versatile electric bike ever created. 


We wanted an electric bike that was designed with a ground up approach that would focus on synergistically combining the best of performance, versatility and handling while remaining
affordable.
Introducing the McFly. 



         



An eBike Built With Components That Deliver On Power, Durability And Versatility. Durability and power were principal design goals when creating the McFly. We wanted to design and work with components that accomplished our goal of delivering the greatest electric bike you'd ever ride. 
The McFly is equipped for bike lanes to bike trails without a single change in components.


The McFly was built with a mid-drive motor that delivers instant power to the crankshaft through direct drive technology. As a result power is transferred instantly to the drive train, increasing torque and creating a natural rhythm when pedaling. 



POWER SYSTEMS
The McFly has two power activation systems. 
Primary engagement is pedal assist. Which works by sensing a riders pedaling motion and activating the motors drive train. Perfect for riding in cities and in groups.  
Secondary engagement is the thumb throttle. Simply push down the throttle and and like that your blasting off. Perfect for off-road riding when your focusing more on technical riding and less on pedaling.

LONGEVITY
McFly’s direct mid-drive motor increases durability exponentially compared to competing hub motors. The McFly's mid-drive motor powers the drive-train directly, while other hub motors transfer power through the bicycles wheels which stresses the bikes spokes, rims and dropouts.



MOTOR SPECS
The McFly has a nominal power rating of 750 watts for on-road usage. 
For off-road situations riders can increase the e-Gears to access 1200 watts of peak power!


25+ MPH


750 Nominal Watts


1200 Peak Watts


92% Electric Motor Efficiency 


100% Awesome








BATTERY SPECS
25+ Mile Range All Electric
60 Mile Range Electric + Pedal
10,000 Lifetime Battery Miles (Over 600+ Charge Cycles)
Only Costs $0.08 For A Full Charge
180 Minute Charge Time

        48 Volt Lithium Cells              11.8 Ah of Capacity             


        Integrated BMS                    Thermal Cooling Design


BATTERY FEATURES
The McFly’s centrally mounted battery design keeps the weight low and grounded making for an exceptionally smooth ride.

Three unique features of the McFly's battery design
1. Intelligent-USB charger keeps your gadgets charged when your on the go. Simply plug it in and you can recharge your gear anywhere.
2. Quick-Detach allows for easy battery removal making battery swaps possible in seconds. Taking the battery inside to charge is a breeze.
3. Steel-Bolt locking mechanism. Locks the battery pack into the frame for extra ruggedness on tough terrain. A keyed entry keeps your battery safe wherever you are. 





With A 25 Mile Radius The Possibilities Are Endless

     


      






Where the power meets the pavement.
Equipped with 29"" wheels for non-stop action the McFly was built to move
fast. 
Rocks, stairs, logs,  and curbs all become play things when under
throttle. The over sized 29"" wheels in conjunction with the mid-drive motor produce
dirt spitting acceleration, for miles of electric grinning.









29"" Tires make it easier to roll over obstacles









We understand that riders will push their bikes to the limit and need reliability.  So we
experimented with different models of brakes before we settled with
Tektro’s mechanical disc brakes.


'What we got was instant stopping power that performed under every condition we could put them through, from rain to mud and everything in between. '








Revolutionized Micro MaintenaceA revolutionary style of eBike maintenance, equipping riders with confidence to know we'll be there every step of the way. Bikes break it's a part of life and electric bikes are no exception. The only problem with electric bikes is that there's no way to get them serviced from a local shop. Usually riders are left with two options either tinkering with the problem themselves are spending money on expensive bike shipping fees to and from the electric bike manufacturer.
We didn't like either of these ideas and we didn't want to leave our riders stranded with a bike they couldn't ride. So we reverse engineered the problem and decided to revolutionize electric bikes by introducing micro maintenance. 
The micro maintenance idea is based off of our plug and play component system. We've integrated the components to easily separate and disassemble from one another, allowing riders to easily remove the faulty component. Riders can then ship the singular  component to our production HQ. Where are experts will fix the kink and ship it right back to the user, for an even easier re-install.
Leaving you in good hands with reliable support for miles and miles of riding. 



The First eBike Solely Designed With An Obsessive Focus On It's Center Of Gravity. 


A low and focused center of gravity
is the defining mark of a great bicycle, determining  everything
from a rider’s ability to transfer power to a grounded riding experience. 



We wanted
to give enthusiast a timeless design that was as much fun as it was versatile. A bike that could go from
office commutes to weekend adventures without a single change of components. 

And while achieving this versatility we wanted to make the McFly look as good as it performed. So we constructed the McFly's frame with 6061 aluminum and setup the drive train as a hybrid singlespeed. 
Our hybrid singlespeed drive-train uses e-Gears instead of mechanical gears allowing you to control your speed and spend more time riding and less time on maintenance.




ON ROAD
Cities within the United States were designed and built around a car commuting society. What we have is sprawl and lengthy journeys between points in cities, making bike commuting difficult. 

And while cities have increased their biking infrastructure the fact is the distance traveled is still too great.  Electric bikes  bridge this gap by increasing a riders practical range of cycling.



The high-performance McFly allows you to ride to work confidentially everyday
Owing a car is expensive with payments, gas, insurance and maintenance 
Owning a McFly will be the smartest commuting choice you'll have 
And 3x car payments later, you could saved enough for a McFly








OFF ROAD
No pavement princess here! The McFly loves getting dirty and is ready for off road trails and adventures any time. Just gear up and you'll see how much fun it is to blast through trails. 29 inch wheels and low key gearing keep those wheels spinning.






If the campaign meets it's goal before December 20th. We'll send out all our decals, shirts and cards early. So you can receive them just before Christmas!
If you select a McFly and we are able to hit our goal by December 20th, we'll be sending out signed thank you cards early as well (so there's something for Christmas.)
Every McFly will be built and shipped from Florida. If successfully funded our timetable is set as 8 weeks of component acquisition followed by 3 weeks of domestic assembly and 2 weeks of processing and shipping. 







  TOGETHERNESS 

Our goal is ambitious, but we know our product is the best and we want to get it out there. To deliver the ultimate electric
bike to market we needed to take our product to Indiegogo to generate a large
volume order. Crowd funding allows us to introduce
the McFly to the market at an affordable price point. 
Together as partners we can
accomplish the goal of funding this campaign in an effort to introduce and fill
the streets of America with ultra-efficient electric bikes.
   LONG TERM VISION

McFly motors has a vision that is
larger than just electric bikes we believe that we can use our team, contacts
and vision to create the largest reduction in CO2 ever seen through the
development of electric ready technologies that borrow principles from our
bikes.

We are fundraising on behalf of our friend Ash Farah’s to obtain secure transportation and housing to avoid any further street harassment for his identities. We are some of Ash’s close friends. We came up with the idea to crowdfund him some funds so he can purchase a safe reliable vehicle and pay for housing. The reason why we are asking for donation towards car purchase fund is due to the harsh reality of being an outed Black trans person. Our friend Ash has encountered numerous transphobic attacks throughout his life. Whether it is from walking, public transportation, or biking. These incidents still occur. In the LGBTQ community, safety is something that we still strive for and just want some peace of mind. To Ash owning a car not only ensures his safety and welling, but as well as restore power to his identity. For those who are learning about Ash. Ash is a young Black trans student at Augsburg University and LGBTQ activist. Those alone keep him busy but along with that, he’s also a care taker for his family. He is the oldest in his Somali immigrant household and juggles with helping out and paying his own household bills. Ash is also a loyal and dependable friend to us all. Not only has he offered his love but he has found resources for us and helped out through our own problems. His contribution to the community has been consistent and you can track it back to when he was in high school. From helping lead local to school organizations, crowdsourcing for food drives, doing encampment supply runs, mentoring queer youth, offering housing for other muslim queers and even volunteering as a protest medic during these pandemic times. For Ash, this is more than a car and support for housing. In the past he has asked friends and community members for rides for food drives, transporting supplies, and transportation. He also offers his space as a safe house for black queer youth. This is something that Ash will continue to provide. We know that Ash's network is big and loving but his financial situation says otherwise. This is due to him being selfless and always putting others ahead of him. Please help us remind Ash why he deserves this and more. 8,000 for a used car 1,000 for fees/taxes 1,000 car title/insurance 7,000 for housing fees (3000 fall, 4000 next).

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why go electric?</h2>
<p><strong>There are a few means of moving around the city - walking, driving, using public transport and cycling</strong></p>
<p>They all have pros and cons - <strong>walking</strong> is fine if you have the time. <strong>Driving </strong>is fun on an open road, but a nightmare in rush hour, plus it is expensive, stressful and harmful for the environment. <strong>Public transport</strong> could be affordable, but who likes to start the day rubbing against a stranger on an overcrowded bus, especially in 2020? Then there is <strong>cycling </strong>- often faster than anything else, affordable and green. The downside is that you may break a sweat on the way to work and make your colleagues unhappy... plus let's face it - sometimes we just want to make things the easy way. This is where <strong>electric bikes</strong> step in.</p>
<p><strong>Electric bicycles have been on the rise for more than a decade, so can we offer anything new? Yes, we can!</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591118255/ari142ekmczmozuy3z3p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We analyzed the needs and habits of urban commuters. Then we took the most suitable features from bicycles and scooters, we added some very distinctive touches, and we created <strong>Vinghen Ti1</strong>. This is a hybrid that combines the concept of a scooter with the size and versatility of a bicycle, allowing you to make the most out of it, whether you are on your commute during the week, or having fun in the mountains over the weekend.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591121444/zuks3o5orc9xenyr4fuk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Choose Vinghen?</h2>
<p>If the contemporary design is not a good enough reason, the distinctive concept of Vinghen Ti1 comes with some neat benefits, compared to its more traditional competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to a bicycle, Vinghen offers:</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591171896/mrjojpomhnfurnzvp4yx.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>

<p><strong>Compared to a scooter, Vinghen offers:</strong></p>

<p>When we designed Vinghen, we wanted to implement these advantages into an iconic design. Our goal was to<strong> make micromobility more attractive</strong> by creating a solution that compliments its owner with a design that is subtle, yet instantly recognizable.</p>
<p>Some of the<strong> key design features</strong>, to achieve this, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plywood deck with exposed bolts and longboard shape.</li>
<li>Patented ""split"" frame that provides increased stiffness for a more engaging ride.</li>
<li>""Fat"" tires for improved comfort, added versatility and cool looks. You can choose between ""city"" and ""country"" tread.</li>
<li>Concealed battery - the battery is hidden and well protected under the deck. It is protected from accidental hits by a steel plate and an external polycarbonate cover.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591177644/qaowtfabq8u7yjppuqqb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Specifications</h2>
<p>We have combined the attractive looks of Vinghen Ti1 with modern e-bike tech, offering competitive specs:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591183491/cdbvqtb9qxjg5o0b7hyb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>More detailed information can be found on our website <a href=""http://www.vinghen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.vinghen.com</a></p>
<p>Besides that, we believe in <strong>factory customization</strong>. Take cars for example - why do you have the possibility to chose between a dozen of colors when you buy a car, but you typically have two colors when it comes to bicycles? We do not like this. Therefore, we offer Vinghen Ti1 with a choice of <strong>four standard and five optional colors.</strong> There is even an exclusive Emerald Green, available only during our Indiegogo campaign!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591127569/o9yhreanl9ds35f2hrpr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We did borrow something else from the automotive world - the pricing. We are offering a base model with a list of available options. This allows us to reduce the starting price of Ti1. So once you have chosen your color, you can move to the add ons:</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Founders Team</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that we have borrowed quite a few ideas from the automotive industry. This is no coincidence - both our<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> founders are engineers with years of experience in development for automotive giants such as Paccar, Daimler and Volkswagen.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591187191/tvo544tghxoz8wsao2pz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>""I am an automotive engineer and I love cars. However, I do love them on the open road and definitely not in the city where they are slow, noisy, dirty, expensive and just don't make much sense.</i></p>
<p><i>I am a firm believer that micro mobility is the future of individual city transportation. Therefore I decided to start Vinghen and to focus on two wheeled electric vehicles for commuting. But I also wanted to make this good fun! Hence with our first product I made certain changes to the traditional push-scooter, so that it is more engaging, more comfortable, and just more enjoyable on the city streets and bike lanes.</i></p>
<p><i>I also wanted to incorporate some of my own style into this product. Therefore I created a V-shaped frame that reminds me of a wave and a step that resembles a surfboard...  well, once Mariyan came on board he suggested that we make it look like a longboard and that's what we did, as it certainly suits Vinghen Ti1 better!""</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591187204/brn0alfvqjxozhqqgngr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>""I am very excited to be part of the Vinghen Ti1 project. The minute I saw Tsvetan's concept, I realized it is an idea with huge potential, so I accepted his offer to work on the design of certain parts of the push-scooter.</i></p>
<p><i>With regards to climate change and traffic congestion, micro mobility is an important topic and Vinghen offers an innovative alternative to the traditional push-scooters. I have to admit that the finished product looks even better than I was imagining and I am positive that once we start series production, we will have one of the most distinctive push scooters on the market.""</i></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why do we need your help?</h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">And what do we want to achieve?</h2>
<p>Creating a new product is a tough job. When you start from scratch, you need to work for years before you make your first sale. These initial sales are extremely important, when it comes to finding investors, making key hires, and preparing for the growth of your business. Indiegogo makes this a little bit easier by providing us with the opportunity to make, in essence, a pre-sale, thus financing our first production batch and spreading the word about Vinghen.</p>
<p>Besides this project, we are also negotiating with some commercial buyers and investor at this very moment. We expect that our efforts will lead to the start of a popular brand that offers well-engineered, distinctive, micromobility products. Our goal is to see more people use electric bicycles and scooters around the city. This leads to less traffic, significant reduction of air pollution, and happier people. </p>
<p><strong>Oh, and we did mention that you need years of hard work to get to production. Have a look at our timeline. It's a long story, but we hope it will be worth it!</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591193560/dpjj1jmvz5nbbgkrcbe6.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>We have already proved our concept by real world testing for nearly a year, so the risks that lay ahead have to do with manufacturing and shipping.</p>
<p>By far the greatest risk at the moment comes from the instability caused by the current pandemic - shortage of materials, manufacturing delays, currency fluctuations.</p>
<p>We have addressed all these issues in our plans - in terms of materials, we are working with multiple suppliers. We have access to several assembly facilities in Asia and Europe, so we believe that we have manufacturing covered too. Dramatic currency fluctuations could happen, but we aim at keeping all our work and expenses transparent and we are ready to issue refunds in we can not fulfill our project due to external factors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Turning this project into a reality means so much to us. Therefore, we would be grateful if you can help us reach our goal. You can do this, not only by choosing a perk, but also by sharing the project with people who may be interested in getting a Vinghen. Doing so would mean the world to us!</p>

The downside is that you may break a sweat on the way to work and make your colleagues unhappy... plus let's face it - sometimes we just want to make things the easy way. This is where electric bikes step in.
Electric bicycles have been on the rise for more than a decade, so can we offer anything new? Yes, we can!

We analyzed the needs and habits of urban commuters. Then we took the most suitable features from bicycles and scooters, we added some very distinctive touches, and we created Vinghen Ti1. This is a hybrid that combines the concept of a scooter with the size and versatility of a bicycle, allowing you to make the most out of it, whether you are on your commute during the week, or having fun in the mountains over the weekend.

 
Why Choose Vinghen?
If the contemporary design is not a good enough reason, the distinctive concept of Vinghen Ti1 comes with some neat benefits, compared to its more traditional competitors.
Compared to a bicycle, Vinghen offers:

 
Compared to a scooter, Vinghen offers:

When we designed Vinghen, we wanted to implement these advantages into an iconic design. Our goal was to make micromobility more attractive by creating a solution that compliments its owner with a design that is subtle, yet instantly recognizable.
Some of the key design features, to achieve this, include:

Plywood deck with exposed bolts and longboard shape.
Patented ""split"" frame that provides increased stiffness for a more engaging ride.
""Fat"" tires for improved comfort, added versatility and cool looks. You can choose between ""city"" and ""country"" tread.
Concealed battery - the battery is hidden and well protected under the deck. It is protected from accidental hits by a steel plate and an external polycarbonate cover.


Specifications
We have combined the attractive looks of Vinghen Ti1 with modern e-bike tech, offering competitive specs:

More detailed information can be found on our website www.vinghen.com
Besides that, we believe in factory customization. Take cars for example - why do you have the possibility to chose between a dozen of colors when you buy a car, but you typically have two colors when it comes to bicycles? We do not like this. Therefore, we offer Vinghen Ti1 with a choice of four standard and five optional colors. There is even an exclusive Emerald Green, available only during our Indiegogo campaign!

We did borrow something else from the automotive world - the pricing. We are offering a base model with a list of available options. This allows us to reduce the starting price of Ti1. So once you have chosen your color, you can move to the add ons:

 
Founders Team
You may have noticed that we have borrowed quite a few ideas from the automotive industry. This is no coincidence - both our founders are engineers with years of experience in development for automotive giants such as Paccar, Daimler and Volkswagen.

""I am an automotive engineer and I love cars. However, I do love them on the open road and definitely not in the city where they are slow, noisy, dirty, expensive and just don't make much sense.
I am a firm believer that micro mobility is the future of individual city transportation. Therefore I decided to start Vinghen and to focus on two wheeled electric vehicles for commuting. But I also wanted to make this good fun! Hence with our first product I made certain changes to the traditional push-scooter, so that it is more engaging, more comfortable, and just more enjoyable on the city streets and bike lanes.
I also wanted to incorporate some of my own style into this product. Therefore I created a V-shaped frame that reminds me of a wave and a step that resembles a surfboard...  well, once Mariyan came on board he suggested that we make it look like a longboard and that's what we did, as it certainly suits Vinghen Ti1 better!""

""I am very excited to be part of the Vinghen Ti1 project. The minute I saw Tsvetan's concept, I realized it is an idea with huge potential, so I accepted his offer to work on the design of certain parts of the push-scooter.
With regards to climate change and traffic congestion, micro mobility is an important topic and Vinghen offers an innovative alternative to the traditional push-scooters. I have to admit that the finished product looks even better than I was imagining and I am positive that once we start series production, we will have one of the most distinctive push scooters on the market.""
Why do we need your help?
And what do we want to achieve?
Creating a new product is a tough job. When you start from scratch, you need to work for years before you make your first sale. These initial sales are extremely important, when it comes to finding investors, making key hires, and preparing for the growth of your business. Indiegogo makes this a little bit easier by providing us with the opportunity to make, in essence, a pre-sale, thus financing our first production batch and spreading the word about Vinghen.
Besides this project, we are also negotiating with some commercial buyers and investor at this very moment. We expect that our efforts will lead to the start of a popular brand that offers well-engineered, distinctive, micromobility products. Our goal is to see more people use electric bicycles and scooters around the city. This leads to less traffic, significant reduction of air pollution, and happier people. 
Oh, and we did mention that you need years of hard work to get to production. Have a look at our timeline. It's a long story, but we hope it will be worth it!

 
Risks and challenges
We have already proved our concept by real world testing for nearly a year, so the risks that lay ahead have to do with manufacturing and shipping.
By far the greatest risk at the moment comes from the instability caused by the current pandemic - shortage of materials, manufacturing delays, currency fluctuations.
We have addressed all these issues in our plans - in terms of materials, we are working with multiple suppliers. We have access to several assembly facilities in Asia and Europe, so we believe that we have manufacturing covered too. Dramatic currency fluctuations could happen, but we aim at keeping all our work and expenses transparent and we are ready to issue refunds in we can not fulfill our project due to external factors.

Other Ways You Can Help
Turning this project into a reality means so much to us. Therefore, we would be grateful if you can help us reach our goal. You can do this, not only by choosing a perk, but also by sharing the project with people who may be interested in getting a Vinghen. Doing so would mean the world to us!",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

A great number of quality components and smart features  bring riders the best riding experience.VIVID is featured in…  ""We are proud of VIVID BIKE for its quality, comfort, safety & price.""Quality & ComfortVIVID is engineered to adopt the state of the art Bafang electric system, which is reputable in the field for its constant and reliable high-quality power output. With up to 20 miles/hour of power assist, VIVID is a relaxing and enjoyable way to start your day. The 350W Bafang Mid/Rear drive motor provides up to 80 N.m torque. Start pedaling and feel the powerful yet silent electric boost kicking in simultaneously. Let’s beat the uphill without breaking a sweat. The electric and sensor system is connected with the Bafang LCD display. You can customize your own settings including speed limit, 6 level pedal assists, and battery duration. To us, bikes are an extension of the rider and shouldn’t only feel right, but look great as well. Our attention to design goes beyond function; to the materials and surfaces, which entails a zero-tolerance towards flaws. The carefully putty-treated aluminium frame finish is every bit beautiful as it is smooth to the touch. Perfection guaranteed. Joy of Riding Enjoy the 48V 10.2A detachable Samsung battery on the Spectre model, which gives you 40-50 miles of power assisted travel on a single charge. Thanks to the Suntor front fork, Kenda puncture-absorption all-terrain tire, ultra-comfortable Velo saddle and Zoom seat suspension, bumpy roads are now gentle and smooth. Looking to exercise and sweat it out? Simply turn off the pedal assist through the display and select from Shimano Alivio 9 speed gears. When you are tired and want to take a break, go fully electric with the throttle and enjoy the automatic drive. A free phone holder is included for you to go further distance. We have selected an integrated USB charger you can juice up your mobile devices on the go. 
Safety is the priority.
Safety is always the top priority for our riders. VIVID has an integrated lighting system which makes your ride safer and more convenient at night. The German-engineered light guarantees you a clear view without disrupting oncoming traffic. We’ve also included a laser tail light for free that looks pretty cool while enhancing your safety. VIVID BIKE is equipped with the Tektro hydraulic disc brake with power cutoff function for your safety. The moment you pull the lever, the motor is cut off instantly so the bike always stays in control. It also provides powerful and reliable braking power and consistent modulation under all weather conditions.Concerned about the thieves on the street? No worries, the battery comes with an in-built key-lock and we’ve included a secure coded lock as an accessory for your peace of mind. PriceWe’ve compared and tested over hundreds of different components and accessories to make the current Vivid prototype. It has been remodeled and updated 6 times in the last two years before we were finally satisfied with the combination of quality and price. We have also streamlined our supply chain and optimized the manufacturing process to make our amazing prices possible. “A good ebike simply should not be that expensive.”Your VIVID comes in four colors available: Metallic Green, Shiny White, Matte Grey and Matte Black. By the way, we’ve included a free package of accessories for everyone including a laser tail light, a phone holder, and a bike tools set.          We want everyone to feel the joy of riding a good eBike.

 The VIVID StoryVIVID BIKE Co. was conceived by a team of 5 bike enthusiasts from different backgrounds. We’ve tried and tested all kinds of ebikes on the markets, ranging from the $4000+ Bosch Mid drive to cheaper rides on Amazon with relatively inferior components. Whether you’re looking to go green or simply looking for an affordable and convenient ride, we aim to provide all bike riders high-quality, durable yet affordable ebikes. There shouldn’t be a premium on green products or convenience and we want to make quality, affordable riding a reality. We want everyone to embrace the joy of riding a good ebike and aim to promote bicycles as a way of life. Real Time Production MonitoringWe've built a robust and trustworthy supply chain management system in the past two years. We are confident to create an order tracking chart for you to monitor the most updated information about your Vivid. Referral ContestPlease refer to the Indiegogo referral contest rules for details to participate.   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) General Are trial rides available?We are currently holding trial rides in London, please email service@vividbike.com to arrange a session.

<p>I love space. I love space travel. I love the idea of my dead body - instead of mouldering and turning to dust in the ground here on our home planet of Earth - rocketing to the farthest edge of our galaxy, and (most likely) orbiting it until the literal end of time.</p>
<p>And now, with the arrival of companies such as <a href=""https://www.blueorigin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blue Origin</a> and <a href=""https://www.spacex.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SpaceX</a> (Hi, Jeff! Hi, Elon! : ), my dream of one day getting literally as far away from all of you as humanly possible is finally a reality.</p>
<p>I've been talking with a friend in the industry ""whom knows about this stuff"", and they have said that, despite the non-negligible plausibility of my goal, because reasons*, the cost of this enterprise is impossible to project. However, the most recent craft to achieve solar escape velocity (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Horizons</a>, 2006) cost $153 million to launch. Hopefully, I won't need to be taking this step for at least 20 more years or so, by which point I'm guesstimating it will be an order of magnitude or so cheaper; hence my $10,000,000 fundraising goal. This is a sum that I obviously could never achieve on my own / without your help, so thank you!</p>
<p>I'm still figuring out what the legal / financial / logistical mechanism(s) to make all this happen after my death are going to look like, ha... But, essentially, I need a contract in place (which can legally be executed post mortem) with a private space travel company (such as Blue Origin or SpaceX) to, upon my death, build and launch some sort of rocket that will get my mortal coil free of the gravity of our Sun. After that, my space coffin (essentially) will carry my soul case to the edge of the Milky Way. Getting my craft to escape our galaxy's gravity is probably out of the question (but things might be different by the time I die.)</p>
<p>The other piece is that I need to have another contract in place with some sort of crack team that will be legally willing &amp; able to retrieve from - potentially - anywhere on Earth, secure, and deliver my dead body to the contracted space flight company.</p>
<p>In order for the crack team to do their job, I’ll have to get a short, clear set of instructions tattooed in some unmissable (by medical professionals) place on my body explaining what to do with it (and, more importantly, what NOT to do with it) in the event of my death.</p>
<p>I will need another contract with a tattoo artist, or perhaps a small group of them, who will be legally able &amp; willing to tattoo my dead body. I should hope the best group of tattoo artists then available, representing all parts of the globe and all traditions in the art form, could comprise those chosen, as the canvas of my skin will be the one representation of that art form to leave our Solar System.</p>
<p>Oh, and my friend ""whom knows about this stuff"" also mentioned I should probably have myself freeze dried in order to cut down on weight (as lbs = £s), so I’ll need yet another contract with someone(s) legally able &amp; willing to do that to me, lol.. (Unless, of course, the consensus on the part of experts is that it would be better, for whatever reason, that my remains should be preserved undessicated.)</p>
<p>Another expense is going to be all the lawyer hours behind setting up the above… Hm, I’m starting to think I should be asking for /much/ more than $10 million. *crying laughing emoji*</p>
<p>Luckily, because these funds are going to go into some sort of trust that won’t (except for the attorney hours) be invoked until my death, we have (Inshallah!) some time for compound interest to do its thing. *smiling sunglasses emoji*</p>
<p>In regards to the obvious question of “Why on Earth are you doing this?!”, the truest, fullest answer is long and complex, but a lot of the main reasons are:</p>
<p>- Why not do something cool, fun, &amp; outrageous with my cadaver / death? I only get one of each!  : D</p>
<p>- I love Science.</p>
<p>- What better tribute could there be to the defining attribute of Humanity (namely, our ability to reason), and what the application of such has been able to create for and by us (namely, Physics, and thereby, space travel), than getting a complete example of one of us out into the larger Universe, far, far beyond our home planet (not to mention the existence of any trace of our entire species / civilization, should we fail to survive long enough to colonize other parts of space)?</p>
<p>- I am ridiculous and love attention.  : )</p>
<p>- Being buried or cremated, or set adrift on a wooden pyre which is then ignited from the shore with flaming arrows, or left in the woods to rot or be eaten all sound so passé… I mean, everything on Earth has been SO done already!</p>
<p>- Hopefully, some alien species will find me at some point far in the future, and their minds will be blown.  : P</p>
<p>- I’ve always wanted to get a tattoo.</p>
<p>- Because it’s there.</p>
<p>- Because we can.</p>
<p>- Because no one else has thought of it yet (at least, out loud and that I’m aware of : ), and likely very, very few of us would want to do it / have it done to their carcass.)</p>
<p>- I was hoping to also get some updated version of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Arecibo message</a> / <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Voyager Golden Records</a> tattooed onto my body; I’m actually suuuper stoked about what we could collectively come up with along those lines these days… *smirking emoji* *rocket emoji* *Starman emoji*</p>
<p>- Is this enough reasons yet for you to realize that I’m being totally serious about this, World?!… : )</p>
<p>Thanks again, everyone, for checking out my Indiegogo, and taking it and me and this dream of mine seriously, and for giving me your support of love, encouragement, sharing with others, and (hopefully) financial backing of any amount! (Everything counts, and we’ll only do this with the help of many, many of us working together.  : )</p>

<p>ps, If any corporations out there want to foot the bill for this entire project, we can put just one big tattoo of your company's logo on my body instead of one each from my Indiegogo backers. Just imagine! Your company's brand, orbiting our galaxy until the end of time! Surely that's worth $10 million?  : D</p>
<p>pps, If the above happens, I'm going to use whatever funds I raise through Indiegogo to take a trip to space while I'm still living.</p>
<p>ppps, Yes, I'm being 100% completely serious.</p>
<p>* Videlicet, the novelty of the proposition, the paucity of relevant data points, the custom nature of my vehicle, the lack of other participants who might potentially lower costs, and the un-straightforward nature of delta-v, inter alia.</p>

- Because no one else has thought of it yet (at least, out loud and that I’m aware of : ), and likely very, very few of us would want to do it / have it done to their carcass.)
- I was hoping to also get some updated version of the Arecibo message / the Voyager Golden Records tattooed onto my body; I’m actually suuuper stoked about what we could collectively come up with along those lines these days… *smirking emoji* *rocket emoji* *Starman emoji*
- Is this enough reasons yet for you to realize that I’m being totally serious about this, World?!… : )
Thanks again, everyone, for checking out my Indiegogo, and taking it and me and this dream of mine seriously, and for giving me your support of love, encouragement, sharing with others, and (hopefully) financial backing of any amount! (Everything counts, and we’ll only do this with the help of many, many of us working together.  : )
Thanks Again,
With Love & In All Sincerity,

ps, If any corporations out there want to foot the bill for this entire project, we can put just one big tattoo of your company's logo on my body instead of one each from my Indiegogo backers. Just imagine! Your company's brand, orbiting our galaxy until the end of time! Surely that's worth $10 million?  : D
pps, If the above happens, I'm going to use whatever funds I raise through Indiegogo to take a trip to space while I'm still living.
ppps, Yes, I'm being 100% completely serious.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We (Jurre, Norman and Gerrit-Jan) teamed up after a rough but meaningful ride from designing to developing and eventually producing the zero series of BAZZKET. It took us about two years to make it to this point. BAZZKET was tested very intensive and proves to be exactly wat we wanted it to be from start.</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot has happened since our zero series of BAZZKET was ready for testing. Now the road is free to introduce it to the world.</li>
<li>Looking for the world to be a better place, not only in  design but also environmentally, Bazzket is for us a major step in that direction. With your help we are looking forward to a great leap into a future of CO2 neutral transportation.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to raise €30.000, so BAZZKET can be produced in quantities that keep the price right with a high standard in quality.</li>
<li><p>When we hit our funding goal properly, the production of BAZZKET will start. Prototyping has been done and BAZZKET also has been tested intensively. So our team is ready and set to take BAZZKET to the next level. We strive to remain the fair retail-price of €95,00 for the colors black, white and silver. The first 100 backers will get an even better price!! This is why our first edition should sell at least 500 units.</p></li>
<li>Check the perks for early adopters!!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Time and effort have already been invested in the designing, developing, prototyping and testing BAZZKET. By having done all that, risk level is reduced to a minimum. </p>
<p>The factory, responsible for the production of our zero-series, has proved to be a confident partner by making prototypes of excellent quality.</p>
<p>So we are ready for manufacturing and powder coating BAZZKET in large numbers.</p>
<p>Deliverable on time in standard colors; black, white and silver. <br/>Custom colors can be delivered on request.</p>
<p>With your help, BAZZKET will be soon on every cyclist's wishlist.</p>

<p>If you want to help us in other ways, we're also very grateful.</p>

We (Jurre, Norman and Gerrit-Jan) teamed up after a rough but meaningful ride from designing to developing and eventually producing the zero series of BAZZKET. It took us about two years to make it to this point. BAZZKET was tested very intensive and proves to be exactly wat we wanted it to be from start.

A lot has happened since our zero series of BAZZKET was ready for testing. Now the road is free to introduce it to the world.
Looking for the world to be a better place, not only in  design but also environmentally, Bazzket is for us a major step in that direction. With your help we are looking forward to a great leap into a future of CO2 neutral transportation.


What We Need & What You Get

The goal is to raise €30.000, so BAZZKET can be produced in quantities that keep the price right with a high standard in quality.
When we hit our funding goal properly, the production of BAZZKET will start. Prototyping has been done and BAZZKET also has been tested intensively. So our team is ready and set to take BAZZKET to the next level. We strive to remain the fair retail-price of €95,00 for the colors black, white and silver. The first 100 backers will get an even better price!! This is why our first edition should sell at least 500 units.
Check the perks for early adopters!!


Risks & Challenges
Time and effort have already been invested in the designing, developing, prototyping and testing BAZZKET. By having done all that, risk level is reduced to a minimum. 
The factory, responsible for the production of our zero-series, has proved to be a confident partner by making prototypes of excellent quality.
So we are ready for manufacturing and powder coating BAZZKET in large numbers.
Deliverable on time in standard colors; black, white and silver. Custom colors can be delivered on request.
With your help, BAZZKET will be soon on every cyclist's wishlist.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you want to help us in other ways, we're also very grateful.

We believe its uniqueness would be attractive to people who dare to change and want to lead the newest fashion in the eBike industry. We have factories in Europe and China, and we've never sold FlowDot eBike on other platforms before. The price on the Indiegogo platform is factory retail price, which is ONLY for our Early Backers.  Here you are, the First Glow-In-The-Dark, One-Piece Magnesium Alloy Frame eBike! With the Bafang Motor, 7-speed gearing Shimano, 6-speed boost, Tektro Disc Brake and up to 38 miles of Battery Range, you’ll never break a sweat from your bike commuting to work again! Weighing merely 41Lbs means you’ll never struggle on carrying it through stairs! Cycling with security even during the darkest nights: FlowDot eBike's body includes a central warning ring that glows in the dark - keep you safe and noticed. ✅ One-Piece Magnesium Alloy Frame✅ Light Ring for Safer Riding✅ 250W Bafang Motor, 36V 7.2Ah Panasonic Battery, Range Up To 38 Miles✅ Shimano 7-Speed Transmissions, TEKTRO Mechanic Disc Brake✅ Works As A Variable-Speed Bike When It's Out Of BatteryReview Video By ElectrifiedReviews FlowDot applies high-qualified AM60b Magnesium Alloy Frame that contributes to the characteristics of damping and durability. This material has made the structure of the eBike integrated without welding joints that eBikes made of aluminium alloy frame typically have. This integrated magnesium alloy structure is one of our patented features.  Following is what makes our FlowDot EBike standing out from all of the other similar eBikes. Luminous Ring: Just one click on the LCD screen, the blue light warning ring will be on. With the added-on light in the middle, others can notice you in the dark. The outstanding appearance reinforces your safety when cycling at nights.  Revolutionary 360 Night View Visualization FlowDot Urban Bike employs a central warning light in the middle to reinforce people’s safety while cycling at nights. FlowDot applies one-piece magnesium alloy frame. Compared with MATE's structure on the right, FlowDot's structure is more sleeky without all of the welding points marked on the picture. Based on the vibration test we've done for the one-piece magnesium alloy frame, it's capable of vibrating 100,000 times in general.   With 250 Watt high speed and the brushless feature, the motor has a 95% conversion rate, which contributes to a 30% higher performance than conventional engines. Motors with this high efficiency can extend the length of riding distance and reduce energy consumption to a large extent. FlowDot applies Myatu Motor with FlowDot eBike while Bafang Motor with FlowDot Pro eBike. BAFANG Motor is lighter than conventional motors, and it is within the high-quality range. FlowDot eBike uses Myatu Battery, while the FlowDot Pro eBike applies Panasonic battery. Both of the FlowDot eBike and the FlowDot Pro eBike are with the range up to 38 miles.  Both of the FlowDot eBike and the FlowDot Pro eBike can be fully charged in 2-3hours.  Where Is The Battery？Batteries are hidden in the appearance of eBikes. In terms of FlowDot, the transom of the bike conceals the battery. It can be easily disassembled when needed to be charged.  FlowDot applies rear suspension to make the eBike comfortable and to prolong the cycling period. The rear suspension within the type of structure is one of our patented features. FlowDot eBike is rain-proof. The material of FlowDot eBike is Magnesium Alloy Frame, and all the wires are under the frame without being exposed to the external environment. Therefore, the eBike is safe no matter being applied under sunshine or in raindrops.  FLOWDOT designs its products with flexibility in mind. You can ride it like a regular bike using the 7-speed Shimano gear system or take advantage of its powerful electrical system. Enjoy up to 250 Watt* of electric motor power, which can take you from 0 to 25 kmh/15.5 mph in a matter of seconds. Bike SizeFlowDot eBikes are currently under production!

<h3>Why did we make the CargoDrive?</h3>
<p>We are an international team who met in Copenhagen, a land well known for the use of bicycles in everyday life. The benefits of this means of transportation really hit home after living here a few years but we couldn't help trying to do more with our bikes.</p>
<p>We started this project to help you get more from your bicycle. With this easy to install addition to your bicycle, we believe you will find your bike more useful than ever before.</p>
<p>The simple combination of a strong cargo rack with an integrated electric system in an easy to install package will make your bicycle a very appealing choice of transportation for many applications.</p>
<h3>Why are we crowdfunding and what does your contribution mean to us?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We started this crowdfunding campaign as we are a small startup and we need more funding to start production at a more accessible price and make it available on an international scale. </p>
<p>In addition to getting production up and running, this campaign will help us develop more accessories to make the CargoDrive even more useful and grow our team to prepare the CargoDrives for you.</p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>We have set a fixed target of 400 CargoDrives sold to ensure that we can deliver the product in a time and quality which we will be proud of. If this goal is not met, all backers will receive their funds back into their account and we will not be able to go into production.</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>For the brave amongst you, we are offering the first 100 CargoDrives at a significant discount. The following 100 CargoDrive backers will also receive a discount. The following CargoDrive backers will still receive a small discount.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>The more backers support us will mean the more we can offer all CargoDrive backers. If we reach 500 CargoDrives sold we will include a pair of HUSKY Bike Tech Dual Action G-hooks. If we reach 1000 CargoDrives sold we will be able to offer wireless PAS systems for all backers. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign helps us realise our goal of helping you get more done with your bike. We believe that making cycling more practical and appealing will bring great benefits to you financially and your wellbeing but also to society at large.</p>
<p>Fewer people driving means less congestion and less pollution. More people cycling means fewer hospital visits and stress on the health care system. This device allows you to make your contribution. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To mitigate risks with supplier shortages and shipping delays we have taken the following measures: </p>
<p>- All electronic parts have been specified and prepared with our supplier before the campaign. The design is also compatible with multiple suppliers should our preferred supplier face difficulty in delivering the product.</p>
<p>- The structural elements will be produced in Europe due to reduced shipping time and reduced pollution associated with shipping. </p>
<p>- Final assembly will be conducted in house to ensure the highest level of quality of what is fundamentally a new product with no existing standard practices. </p>
<p>On top of all this, we have a strong team of experienced people both in-house and who we work with already. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that for many this product may seem like a great idea but it doesn't suit your needs or situation. </p>
<p>If you would like to help our cause it would be extremely valuable for us if you share this campaign with others. You can see the social media links at the top of the page.</p>

A tool built for carrying cargo. Easily carry 30 kg/66 lbs for up to 60 km/37 mi.
No need to buy an expensive cargo bike. Use your existing bicycle instead. 
What is the CargoDrive?
The CargoDrive comes as a complete package that can easily transform your bicycle into an electric cargo bike.

It is designed to carry things, such as bulky packages, bags, groceries, toolboxes or anything up to 30kg. 

How it works
1. It mounts on your bicycle by removing your front wheel, then installing your bike into the CargoDrive using the fork dropouts as locators. 

2. Secure the CargoDrive by tightening the universal clamps.

3. Connect the loading surface, display and other cables and you are ready to ride.

<p align=""left""><strong>Quality</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">From the trucks, to motors, batteries and control boards, every piece of the Eagle hunting wind board went through countless revisions to strengthen and fine tune. Our maple/bamboo deck was designed with a high level of flex ( a  boards  natural suspension) to deliver a smooth cruising experience.</p>
<p align=""left"">After over a year of development, we are extremely pleased with what Eagle hunting wind has become today. </p>
<p align=""left"">Components and parts are readily available and have been designed as user replaceable to ensure your board is always rockin.</p>
<p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506302192/dtmakhb3bkgnsdzyzbtl.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506302209/icodwrwhmqrdqdzio4e6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Affordable</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">This was the driving factor that kept us focused while creating Eagle hunting wind. There was yet to be a quality board available at an affordable price.</p>
<p align=""left"">We kept our team small, our overhead low. Removed unnecessary and cost bloating features such as flashy lights and carbon fiber decks.</p>
<p align=""left"">We kept the design pure and crafted an exceptional riding experience.</p>
<p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506302237/a5d6jshpzt7uvg9wh9jx.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p align=""left""><strong>Highly Weather Resistant</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">Born and raised in Hong Kong, you learn to adapt to the ever-changing weather. Eagle hunting wind is no exception :).</p>
<p align=""left"">A board that couldn't handle a little water, or a mid-day shower didn't really work for us.</p>
<p align=""left"">For this reason, we sealed the motors inside the wheels and sealed up all the edges.</p>
<p align=""left"">You won't want to take your board swimming, but it CAN handle a lot. We battle tested the Eagle hunting wind board in the harsh conditions of Hong Kong taking on puddles, slush, and even snow.</p>
<p align=""left"">Similar though to a regular skateboard, if you do get your components wet, you will want to dry them off when you are done riding to avoid rust and damaging bearings ;)</p>
<p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506302275/novew2aliouhigeumchq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Urban Commuting Just Got Easier</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">The Eagle hunting wind's compact deck and handles make it easy bring on a train or to throw into the trunk of an Uber. The large, soft wheels make the board perfect for poor city pavement. And lastly, the inclusion of headlights and tail lights will help other drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists see you at busy intersections at low light.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Traveling? Bring your Riptide</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">The Eagle hunting wind comes with a precisely engineered battery capacity that is within the range of TSA guidelines. Once you're past security the small size and handles make the Eagle hunting wind a breeze to transport through the terminal or to check into the overhead compartment.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>The Perfect Addition to Your Electric Skateboard Quiver</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">Everyone who rides an electric skateboard knows it more fun to ride with friends (or your wife / husband / kid / grandma / etc). With a Riptide as your second board now you've got something they can ride at a competitive price that can actually keep up with more premium boards.</p>
<p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506302330/nv9zisub6ahzyic53p95.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>A Serious Drive Train</strong></p>
<p>The Eagle hunting wind's 2500W dual belt drive train means it can scream off the line up to the top speed of 35 mph and power up hills unlike any other board its size.</p>
<p><strong>Unrivaled Portability</strong></p>
<p>At only 7.6KG with a After folding 500MM deck, dual handles, and an airline-friendly, and &lt;120Wh battery, you can easily bring the Eagle hunting wind wherever your travels take you.</p>
<p><strong>Premium Longboard Components</strong></p>
<p>With the Eagle hunting wind our goal was a fast, fun ride while maintaining portability and we didn't mind adding a pound or two getting there. Thus the board has 275mm wide trucks and comes with the large diameter.</p>
<p><strong>Ride for Miles and Miles</strong></p>
<p>With up-to-an 25 miles of range in real world conditions and an optional fast charger that recharges the board in just 120 mins, you'll be able to park your car for the weekend and not touch it til Monday.</p>
<p><strong>Ride All Night</strong></p>
<p>Optional Headlights and Tail Lights provided by Shredlights can be set to ""On,"" ""Blink,"" or ""High Beam,"" meaning you can ride all night and be seen by everyone around you.</p>

""I'm really shocked, it's how light"" - JACK
""We took a new Eagle hunting wind spin, which was amazing! - Tianying Tech
""An impressive technology"" -  Tianying Technology
""With impressive specs like a 22 mile range and navigation capabilities, the [Eagle hunting wind] Travel board just may be a board like no other.""- Tianying, Tech on a Budget
“It’s fast. These hills are big. If they can handle these hills, they can handle anything. It’s too easy.”- DAVID
“This is the board you’re looking for!…It doesn’t feel cheap, and it’s definitely not a toy. Even if your battery dies, you can use it as a traditional skateboard. Practically weightless compared to other e-skateboards that can weigh up to 30lbs.""- Ruifeng, Tech on a Budget


Lean Forward to Go. Lean Back to Stop.
After your first ride, you'll realize that there is nothing else in the world quite like it! Even if you've never ridden a skateboard before, the Eagle hunting wind’s intuitive control will have you carving in no time with its weight-sensing foot pads. Speed control is completely variable – cruise at walking speed or race to its top speed of 20 miles per hour.
Leaning back kicks in regenerative braking, meaning you can safely descend hills while also recharging the battery.

Battery Meter and Speed Charger
The Eagle hunting wind’s power button is surrounded by a multi-color LED ring that changes colors as the battery diminishes.

Eagle hunting wind’s ergonomic bluetooth-enabled remote control puts power in the palm of your hand.

Tackle tough climbs with Eagle hunting wind's impressive grade capabilities.
Eagle hunting wind’s ergonomic bluetooth-enabled remote control gives you the power at your fingertips.

Grab and Go Anywhere: Lightweight and Splashproof
By using waterproof connectors the Eagle hunting wind can be ridden on wet surfaces without fear of damage to the electronics. Though the board mechanically can handle water exposure, we do not recommend riding in the rain due to potential rusting of components and loss of traction.
Featuring a lightweight 100kg design and two integrated handles,Eagle hunting wind’s ergonomic design makes it easy to pick up, carry, and store. Speed up your commute, forget about parking, & enjoy running errands with the most portable electric vehicle on the market!

With 3 easy steps, the product is simple to set up and intuitive to use.


Quality. Safety. Durability. Eagle hunting wind electric skateboard motors are IPX6 waterproof rated so you can ride with confidence.

Quality
From the trucks, to motors, batteries and control boards, every piece of the Eagle hunting wind board went through countless revisions to strengthen and fine tune. Our maple/bamboo deck was designed with a high level of flex ( a  boards  natural suspension) to deliver a smooth cruising experience.
After over a year of development, we are extremely pleased with what Eagle hunting wind has become today. 
Components and parts are readily available and have been designed as user replaceable to ensure your board is always rockin.

Affordable
This was the driving factor that kept us focused while creating Eagle hunting wind. There was yet to be a quality board available at an affordable price.
We kept our team small, our overhead low. Removed unnecessary and cost bloating features such as flashy lights and carbon fiber decks.
We kept the design pure and crafted an exceptional riding experience.


Highly Weather Resistant
Born and raised in Hong Kong, you learn to adapt to the ever-changing weather. Eagle hunting wind is no exception :).
A board that couldn't handle a little water, or a mid-day shower didn't really work for us.
For this reason, we sealed the motors inside the wheels and sealed up all the edges.
You won't want to take your board swimming, but it CAN handle a lot. We battle tested the Eagle hunting wind board in the harsh conditions of Hong Kong taking on puddles, slush, and even snow.
Similar though to a regular skateboard, if you do get your components wet, you will want to dry them off when you are done riding to avoid rust and damaging bearings ;)

Urban Commuting Just Got Easier
The Eagle hunting wind's compact deck and handles make it easy bring on a train or to throw into the trunk of an Uber. The large, soft wheels make the board perfect for poor city pavement. And lastly, the inclusion of headlights and tail lights will help other drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists see you at busy intersections at low light.
Traveling? Bring your Riptide
The Eagle hunting wind comes with a precisely engineered battery capacity that is within the range of TSA guidelines. Once you're past security the small size and handles make the Eagle hunting wind a breeze to transport through the terminal or to check into the overhead compartment.
The Perfect Addition to Your Electric Skateboard Quiver
Everyone who rides an electric skateboard knows it more fun to ride with friends (or your wife / husband / kid / grandma / etc). With a Riptide as your second board now you've got something they can ride at a competitive price that can actually keep up with more premium boards.

A Serious Drive Train
The Eagle hunting wind's 2500W dual belt drive train means it can scream off the line up to the top speed of 35 mph and power up hills unlike any other board its size.
Unrivaled Portability
At only 7.6KG with a After folding 500MM deck, dual handles, and an airline-friendly, and <120Wh battery, you can easily bring the Eagle hunting wind wherever your travels take you.
Premium Longboard Components
With the Eagle hunting wind our goal was a fast, fun ride while maintaining portability and we didn't mind adding a pound or two getting there. Thus the board has 275mm wide trucks and comes with the large diameter.
Ride for Miles and Miles
With up-to-an 25 miles of range in real world conditions and an optional fast charger that recharges the board in just 120 mins, you'll be able to park your car for the weekend and not touch it til Monday.
Ride All Night
Optional Headlights and Tail Lights provided by Shredlights can be set to ""On,"" ""Blink,"" or ""High Beam,"" meaning you can ride all night and be seen by everyone around you.

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>Formula Student Cantabria is a students' team from multiple engineering degrees of the University of Cantabria, in the city of Santander in the north of Spain. Our goal is to compete with an electric single-seater in the Spanish event of Formula Student to celebrate in the Circuit of Catalunya (Montmeló) in August 2015.</p>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Formula Student or Formula SAE is an international competition between universities around the world. In this championship each team has to design, construct and develop a complete single-seater car, which will be driven by some members of the team.</span></div>
<div>
<div>
<p>First of all, the team has to submit their design and a business case. Then, after a technical inspection, the track events starts. Acceleration, cornering ability, stability, efficiency and endurance are tested.</p>
<p>The competition and the university teams are sponsored by big companies such like Porsche, SEAT, Red Bull, Mathworks, Bosch and many more. Is also followed by F1 people looking for new talents or ideas.</p>
<p><i>""What I find most appealing about Formula Student is the innovation that it encourages, as the competition rules give the entrants a lot of design freedom. This results in many different solutions to the same issues... ""</i></p>
<p><i><i>“There are only two innovative types of motorsport left: Formula 1 and Formula Student.”</i></i></p>
<p><i><i><i>-Ross Brawn</i></i></i></p>
<h3><i><i>The Proyect</i></i></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our final design is a vehicle under 300 kg of weight and 40 kW (55 HP) of power distributed in 4 motors conected to the rear wheels. It will provide a 0-100 kph acceleration of about 3.5 seconds. The car will reach half an hour of battery life to complete the endurance test. We are developing a KERS system which would give us a huge amount of extra power and an important reduction in the battery weight and cost.</span>
</div>
<div>This is a concept of the bodywork, the final version will have several improvements:<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435855753/gxu9vqyzusyvtwuhsaqr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>La Formula Student o Formula SAE es una competición a nivel internacional en la que se citan equipos de diferentes universidades. Dicho campeonato promueve la excelencia en ingeniería mediante el diseño, construcción y prueba en circuito de un monoplaza.</p>
<p>En el diseño priman no sólo el
trabajo técnico si no también el plan productivo del vehículo, por lo que se
requiere crear un plan de producción que se ajuste adecuadamente a un mercado

</div>","About us
Formula Student Cantabria is a students' team from multiple engineering degrees of the University of Cantabria, in the city of Santander in the north of Spain. Our goal is to compete with an electric single-seater in the Spanish event of Formula Student to celebrate in the Circuit of Catalunya (Montmeló) in August 2015.
Formula Student or Formula SAE is an international competition between universities around the world. In this championship each team has to design, construct and develop a complete single-seater car, which will be driven by some members of the team.


First of all, the team has to submit their design and a business case. Then, after a technical inspection, the track events starts. Acceleration, cornering ability, stability, efficiency and endurance are tested.
The competition and the university teams are sponsored by big companies such like Porsche, SEAT, Red Bull, Mathworks, Bosch and many more. Is also followed by F1 people looking for new talents or ideas.
""What I find most appealing about Formula Student is the innovation that it encourages, as the competition rules give the entrants a lot of design freedom. This results in many different solutions to the same issues... ""
“There are only two innovative types of motorsport left: Formula 1 and Formula Student.”
-Ross Brawn
The Proyect
Our final design is a vehicle under 300 kg of weight and 40 kW (55 HP) of power distributed in 4 motors conected to the rear wheels. It will provide a 0-100 kph acceleration of about 3.5 seconds. The car will reach half an hour of battery life to complete the endurance test. We are developing a KERS system which would give us a huge amount of extra power and an important reduction in the battery weight and cost.

This is a concept of the bodywork, the final version will have several improvements:


The economical requirements of this project are the following:
Chassis: 1000€
Brakes System: 1600€
Bodywork: 1050€
Motor and Battery Systems: 8000€
Steering and Suspension Systems: 5800€
Cockpit: 545€
Drivers clothes and helmets: 735€
Shipping, Tools and Unexpected Occurs: 3900€
Registration Payments: 1800€
TOTAL: 24.430€ 
As of today, thanks to our sponsors we just need a small fraction of the total budget.
We need your help to achieve our goals.

Open Source Electric Formula SAE

In addition to our competition project we want anybody to have the choice to build its own formula electric car. That's why we want to make our designs public, and update them every year with the new improvements designed.
In fact, thanks to our open source project, you will be able to use our designs with commercial purposes.

<h3><b>Inspiration -</b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We never forgot our first
experiences riding a Tesla. Being a sports car enthusiasts ourselves, we
found the Tesla driving experience to be unlike any car we had ever driven
before. A whole new world of driving excitement had just been unleashed with the shear power of green energy! It is the ride of tomorrow, today. We
felt compelled to share this green energy driving experience with the world, and the way to make that happen was to make it affordable for everyone.  </p>
<p>We were inspired by other car
sharing operators and businesses that allow people to rent out their cars by the
hour while they normally would just be collecting dust. But, when we searched
in our area to rent a Tesla, we found ourselves completely out of luck. We brainstormed different ideas and we developed vukee Car Service. The
future of car sharing is here; and we have incorporated all the very best of
the car sharing experience for you, right now! </p>

<h3><b>Why did we create
vukee Car?  </b></h3>
<p>For the sheer fun of it! <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">vukee Car turns every Tesla into unique vehicle beings complete with memories and shared joys of old friends and past driving adventures.
 Every vukee Car has a unique ID that can be traced back to find out where
life has taken her.  </span></p>
<h3><b>Why Indiegogo? </b></h3>
<p>We need you to make this happen. We need your help to find out which major cities across the nation should
be the first starting point. And, we need your help to finance the first
25 cars. You can pledge to drive the car in your city. You tell us where
to start by the concentration of pledges that will come in of a given region. The pledges will help us create a roadmap and determine in what cities to
start first and then connect all the city points in the next steps.
 Adding cities as we grow widens the convenience of drop off charge points
allowing for greater renter flexibility until we have stretched across America.

<p><b>Where we're at!</b></p>
<p>We’ve been working on the concept

we are ready to travel down the road of tomorrow.  </p>
<p>With your support, we can bring
the affordable green driving experience of the high end luxury Tesla MODEL S® to the
market - worldwide; and help change the way we view and use transportation
today. While we're close to going live, your contribution will help:</p>

<h3><b>Production &amp;
Delivery Plan</b></h3>
<p>May 2013: Our Prototype has
delivered and start with different scenarios to make our idea happen. At this
time we focused to use specific interface on Tesla Cars and starting to develop
the specific white paper </p>
<p>August 2013: Tesla response vukee
Car Whitepaper not good enough for partnership. They limit the minimum order of
cars to 100 units.</p>
<p>September 2013: First tests with
external hardware (3G connected unit in the car) which communicates to vukee Car
Backend Server</p>
<p>April 2014: Going to deposit $62.500 at Tesla Motors, Inc. for delivery of 25 Tesla MODELS<i>®</i> cars</p>
<p>June 2014: Delivery of first 10 Tesla MODEL S<i>®</i> cars</p>
<h3><b>Rewards</b></h3>
<p>•<span>  </span>Sponsor gets name wrapped on a vukee Car Tesla in their city (Only pledge: ""Your name on a TESLA"").</p>
<p>•<span>  </span>Sponsor receives earned time to drive the Tesla and experience the ride
for him/herself.  </p>
<p>•<span>  </span>Sponsor gets updates on vukee Car rental experiences by a small
donation.</p>
<h3><b>Our Vision:</b></h3>
<p>vukee is the fleet leasing brand
that will bring the Tesla MODEL S® to the general public. Tesla users are
enthusiastic motorists who want to experience today’s state of the art vehicle
technology first hand and at their leisure by leasing time with their favorite
cars. After the launch, the pricing for renting a Tesla is based on an
algorithm of availability, duration, location option, prepayment, and special
routes. We will start with 25 vehicles centered inside the viewable ""home
zones"".  Every quarter after, we will add more Tesla's to the fleet.
Expansion of the geographical areas in 2014 and 2015 will eventually cover the
U.S. from West to East Coast. European expansion will begin with
the availability of Supercharger stations.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Special thanks</b></h3>
<p>We would like to thank all the people who helped and supported us along the way. Without you we wouldn't be here. </p>
<p>In no special order:  <b>Meik </b>and<b> Agneta Lindberg</b>, <b>Celine, Melina </b>and<b> Leonardo </b>as the Lindberg Family<b>, Steve Clark, Rick Valantine, Jaycee Clark, Andrew Schauwecker, Jim Ness for recording in his amazing Man-Cave </b>and<b> Tracey Claxton</b> as best supporting actors, <b>Chris Mckechnie</b>, director at <a href=""http://digitalcinemaguy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">digitalcinemaguy.com</a> and his assistants <b>Ryan Amaradio.</b> Thank you very much!</p>
<br/><p></p>
<h4><b>Risks and challenges</b></h4>
<p>From a risk management perspective,
there are many ""what-if"" scenarios that haven't played out yet. There
is also risk of oversimplification in a polarized political atmosphere,
conflating legitimate policy goals with indefensible rent-seeking by incumbents. 
The ""cab wars"" currently being fought in major cities are a classic
example: Everybody claims to be pro-consumer, but it's just as tempting
for those on one side (medallion owners) to cite issues like safety as pretext
for protectionism as it is for others to cite entrenchment as a pretext to
overstate ideologically driven total deregulation of business. Finally, we need
seed business to find out the potential cities, getting first cars rent before
we start with Indiegogo.</p>

Drive a MODEL S® automobile
The Tesla MODEL S® is better to
understand if you see this vehicle as an iPhone on wheels. vukee will create a platform that will allow qualified individuals to have rental access to Tesla. Using this platform, renting a Tesla will be as easy as renting a DVD from Redbox. The pickup and drop off has to be at restricted charger
stations near you. These software-controlled vehicle rentals will be available
in remote locations at anytime without visiting a counter or office (store).
vukee is developing a backend and frontend software system that interfaces with
Tesla’s cars that will include high safety standards to regulate rental
restriction routes.

All cars are wrap designed with
names of the Donators. Make a vukee Car your car! If you wish, we will add your
name onto one of the vukee Cars in your city. The size of your name depends of

is used to add your names.  Also you’re
allowed to see where your car is driving in real time and view updates to the

life has taken her.  
Why Indiegogo? 
We need you to make this happen. We need your help to find out which major cities across the nation should
be the first starting point. And, we need your help to finance the first
25 cars. You can pledge to drive the car in your city. You tell us where
to start by the concentration of pledges that will come in of a given region. The pledges will help us create a roadmap and determine in what cities to
start first and then connect all the city points in the next steps.
 Adding cities as we grow widens the convenience of drop off charge points
allowing for greater renter flexibility until we have stretched across America.
 
Pledges for your (West
Coast) City:












Please pledge for the area you want to rent a vukee Car. If you later decide to rent one of the cars in another area, you always can, your pledge will be valid in all areas. 


Where we're at!
We’ve been working on the concept
for many months. We have built an amazing app coupled with an amazing team and
we are ready to travel down the road of tomorrow.  
With your support, we can bring
the affordable green driving experience of the high end luxury Tesla MODEL S® to the
market - worldwide; and help change the way we view and use transportation
today. While we're close to going live, your contribution will help:
•  Fund the first 25 vehicles of the vukee Car fleet
•  Choose which city and region to start our fleet by what makes the most
sense in the west coast
Production &
Delivery Plan
May 2013: Our Prototype has
delivered and start with different scenarios to make our idea happen. At this
time we focused to use specific interface on Tesla Cars and starting to develop
the specific white paper 
August 2013: Tesla response vukee
Car Whitepaper not good enough for partnership. They limit the minimum order of
cars to 100 units.
September 2013: First tests with
external hardware (3G connected unit in the car) which communicates to vukee Car
Backend Server
April 2014: Going to deposit $62.500 at Tesla Motors, Inc. for delivery of 25 Tesla MODELS® cars
June 2014: Delivery of first 10 Tesla MODEL S® cars
Rewards
•  Sponsor gets name wrapped on a vukee Car Tesla in their city (Only pledge: ""Your name on a TESLA"").
•  Sponsor receives earned time to drive the Tesla and experience the ride
for him/herself.  
•  Sponsor gets updates on vukee Car rental experiences by a small
donation.
Our Vision:
vukee is the fleet leasing brand
that will bring the Tesla MODEL S® to the general public. Tesla users are
enthusiastic motorists who want to experience today’s state of the art vehicle
technology first hand and at their leisure by leasing time with their favorite
cars. After the launch, the pricing for renting a Tesla is based on an
algorithm of availability, duration, location option, prepayment, and special
routes. We will start with 25 vehicles centered inside the viewable ""home
zones"".  Every quarter after, we will add more Tesla's to the fleet.
Expansion of the geographical areas in 2014 and 2015 will eventually cover the
U.S. from West to East Coast. European expansion will begin with
the availability of Supercharger stations.

Special thanks
We would like to thank all the people who helped and supported us along the way. Without you we wouldn't be here. 
In no special order:  Meik and Agneta Lindberg, Celine, Melina and Leonardo as the Lindberg Family, Steve Clark, Rick Valantine, Jaycee Clark, Andrew Schauwecker, Jim Ness for recording in his amazing Man-Cave and Tracey Claxton as best supporting actors, Chris Mckechnie, director at digitalcinemaguy.com and his assistants Ryan Amaradio. Thank you very much!

Risks and challenges
From a risk management perspective,
there are many ""what-if"" scenarios that haven't played out yet. There
is also risk of oversimplification in a polarized political atmosphere,
conflating legitimate policy goals with indefensible rent-seeking by incumbents. 
The ""cab wars"" currently being fought in major cities are a classic
example: Everybody claims to be pro-consumer, but it's just as tempting
for those on one side (medallion owners) to cite issues like safety as pretext
for protectionism as it is for others to cite entrenchment as a pretext to
overstate ideologically driven total deregulation of business. Finally, we need
seed business to find out the potential cities, getting first cars rent before
we start with Indiegogo.

<h3>So far, we've done the R&amp;D and developed fully working pre-production Buddies ...</h3>
<p>We're currently totally self-funded and have <strong>already</strong> developed everything needed to make EnergyBuddy work.</p>
<p>We have been working hard with our manufacturing partner in China since September last year. Injection mold tooling has been fabricated and is undergoing final adjustments. Printed circuit boards have been revised and are now final. And we are just putting the finishing touches to our firmware, cloud software and mobile apps.</p>
<p>The first 100 production samples are being built and we are already working with the first few units from this batch (see our update page for the latest production photos).</p>
<p>PLUS - we've had great feedback since we demonstrated our pre-production Buddies at this year's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas back in January and at other recent events.</p>
<p>AND - our heartfelt thanks to Sarah and Joseph from Engadget (<strong><a href=""http://www.engadget.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.engadget.com</a></strong>) for stopping by while we were setting up the EnergyBuddy stand at the CEA Line Show in New York just before the show opened.</p>
<p>Read what they had to say, see some great pictures and check out their short video of EnergyBuddy here: <strong><a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/26/futuredash-energybuddy-hands-on"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/26/futuredash-energybuddy-hands-on</a></strong></p>
<h3>And now we need your help!</h3>
<p>BUT - to make our dream come true and to get EnergyBuddy into as many homes as possible we need to raise enough commitment to place a volume production order and get EnergyBuddy manufactured at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p><strong>That's where YOU can become a part of this!</strong></p>
<p>We need your contributions for us to place our first production order.</p>
<p>And - we'd love your longer-term involvement and feedback once you've received your EnergyBuddy to help us make it even better!</p>
<h3>What will we spend your money on?</h3>
<p>Your contribution will effectively be a pre-order. We're offering various combinations of EnergyBuddy options - just take a look at the perks list!</p>
<p>Then - if we hit our project goal - the funding will be used for us to complete regulatory approvals, start volume manufacturing and launch the home energy monitoring revolution!</p>
<p>We expect (if everything goes according to plan) to start shipping the perk Buddies by early November.</p>

</ul><h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>We've been asked a bunch of questions since this campaign launched - we hope the answers help. We'll add to this list as it grows - if you have a question that isn't on the list below then simply contact us and we'll get you the answer!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>[Q] ""How many current transformer clamps are included in the Home Kits?""</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Home Kits</strong> come with 2 CT (current transformer) clamps and one transmitter.  This is for dual 120V conductors (as is typical in the U.S./ Canada).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Q] ""How long is the battery assumed to last in the (current transfomer) transmitter?""</strong><br/><ul>
<li>About 9 months, and we expect longer with better quality batteries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Q] ""What’s the maximum number of SmartPlugs that can be supported by a single EnergyBuddy?""</strong><br/><ul>
<li>Theoretically there is no limit that our software can support.  Any limitation will come from the wireless link being used with the sensors and SmartPlugs.</li>
<li>We are using a proprietary 433MHz radio link with our CT clamp transmitter and SmartPlugs, and we are confidently testing with 10 SmartPlugs simultaneously at the moment.</li>
<li>If you need to manage a larger amount of devices, power strips and appliances then we recommend that you use the ZigBee version of EnergyBuddy that will be available later in the year. ZigBee will also be available as an optional upgrade to the initial 433MHz EnergyBuddy via a ZigBee USB dongle that we plan to offer. We will also be recommending, or possibly offering directly, ZigBee enabled SmartPlugs.<strong><br/></strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><strong>[Q] ""What support are you offering for International versions of EnergyBuddy?""</strong></strong>
<ul>
<li>Certified international versions of EnergyBuddy will start to be available, probably by the end of the year. The AC adapter for the gateway is easily swapped for one with the correct plug (they are all universal AC voltage input already). Our CT clamp wireless transmitter supports up to three plug-in CT clamps, so can be used with one clamp for 220V-240V single phase, single conductor supply, two clamps for dual 120V conductors (as is typical in the U.S./ Canada), and three clamps for 3-phase. There will be 3 different sizes of CT clamp available that can support maximum conductor diameters of 15mm, 18mm and 25mm. AC voltage used for power calculations is programmable in our setup app. And a 220V – 240V version of the SmartPlugs already exists, that has options for several of the common plug types, including Schuko. It’s mostly a matter of getting everything certified for the specific countries or regions, and language localization of the software, and as a startup it comes down to cost and time. We are trying to get there as fast as we can, though please bear with us!</li>
<li>In the meantime, <strong>our basic Home Kit could be used internationally</strong>. The AC adapter for the gateway has universal AC voltage input and would just need an appropriate plug adapter. Although two CT clamps are provided, they are plug in, and so for 220V-240V single phase, single conductor AC supply, like in most of Europe, only one would need to be used. And the AC voltage used for power calculations is programmable in our setup app. Hence as long as the CT clamp will physically fit (maximum conductor size is 18mm for the standard Home Kit), then EnergyBuddy Home Kit (no SmartPlugs) should be useable. Language in the apps and browser dashboards will be U.S. English.  We have added options for international shipping.  However, such international orders will need to be at your own risk and liability, and with the understanding that the product will probably not yet have passed safety and electro-magnetic compatibility certifications for your country (other than the AC adapter). We will do our best to support your installation, and will support a return if it will not work, however we will not be able to cover return shipping costs.</li>
<li>We will also support kits with SmartPlugs for international use in countries with 120V supply, under the same conditions as above. This will include Canada, Mexico and other countries that we will be announcing in due course.</li>
<li>The EnergyBuddy kits will have passed UL or ETL safety certification for the U.S., and FCC Part 15 electro-magnetic compatibility testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><strong><strong>[Q] </strong></strong>""What Support does EnergyBuddy offer for 3-phase?""</strong>
<ul>
<li>Our CT clamp wireless transmitter supports up to three plug-in CT clamps, so with three clamps can support 3-phase. This gives the total power on all three phases and does not break out power on each phase. There will be 3 different sizes of CT clamp available that can support maximum conductor diameters of 15mm, 18mm and 25mm. AC voltage is programmable in our setup app.</li>
<li>We will setup sales for optional additional CT clamps later on our EnergyBuddy website.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><strong><strong>[Q] </strong></strong>""Do you offer support for second or more electrical panels""</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional electrical panels can be supported with optional add-on sets of CT clamps plus wireless transmitter, which we will make available via the EnergyBuddy website later.  This will also require a cloud software update to be able to designate multiple panels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><strong><strong>[Q] </strong></strong>""Support for PV/solar and other renewable energy generation""</strong>
<ul>
<li>Support for PV and other power generation will be added in a later cloud software update, which will also include support for feed-in tariffs if appropriate. A second set of CT clamps and wireless transmitter, for the output of your inverter, will be required to monitor generation. The CT clamps will be available as an optional add-on, so you can get initially started with an EnergyBuddy kit for monitoring consumption, and add the generation monitoring later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><strong><strong>[Q] </strong></strong>""Is there a ZigBee version of EnergyBuddy?""</strong>
<ul>
<li>The initial version of EnergyBuddy available for pre-ordering uses a proprietary 433MHz wireless link to the CT clamp transmitter and SmartPlugs, and does not include a ZigBee radio.</li>
<li>The ZigBee version of EnergyBuddy will be available later in the year and will also have options to support ZigBee Home Automation Profile, ZigBee Smart Energy Profile or both. And it will be able to support other ZigBee enabled devices compatible with the appropriate Profile. There are already some third party ZigBee smart plugs and other energy sensors / controls that we support and we will announce details of these later. If a specific ZigBee device requires a new dashboard, for example a ZigBee programmable thermostat, then new dashboards can be added via a cloud software and mobile apps update.</li>
<li>For those pre-ordering an EnergyBuddy, we will also later offer a ZigBee upgrade via an optional ZigBee USB dongle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><strong><strong>[Q] ""Can the initial version of EnergyBuddy be upgraded to support ZigBee later?""</strong></strong></strong><br/><ul>
<li>For those pre-ordering an EnergyBuddy, we will also later offer a ZigBee upgrade via an optional ZigBee USB dongle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Q] ""How can I monitor hard-wired appliances, such as HVAC, and lighting?""</strong>
<ul>
<li>For monitoring hard-wired appliances such as split A/C, electric ovens, lighting etc., there is a third party multi-circuit monitor that we support with the ZigBee version of EnergyBuddy that requires professional installation at the main electrical panel.  We will provide more details on this later.<strong><br/></strong>
</li>
<li>However, even with our basic Home Kit, it’s easy to get a good idea of the incremental cost of each device or appliance as you switch it on or off, via our mobile apps and browser dashboards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Q] ""Does EnergyBuddy offer support for tiered, TOU and utility specific tariff rates?""</strong><br/><ul>
<li>General TOU tariffs will be supported in the initial version, though the user will need to manually enter the start and end of each time period and the corresponding rate. In a later cloud software update, we plan to offer the ability for the user to select their appropriate TOU tariff without having to make any manual entries.<strong><br/></strong>
</li>
<li>For tiered tariffs it is not easy to provide a general way to enter a scheme that will cover the myriad and complexity of tiered tariffs available from the more than 3,000 utility companies in the U.S., and the fact that those schemes may change on a monthly or seasonal basis in some cases. Our recommendation for tiered tariffs is either to set a fixed average rate (cents per kWh) that represents your average rate (usually shown on your utility bill), or to set a fixed rate that represents the cost of the tier that you generally end up in by the end of the billing cycle. The latter at least tells you the rate at which you will be saving if you reduce your usage, until the point that you save enough to drop in to the next lower tier.</li>
<li>We will later have a cloud software update that will add Green Button support (download of your utility data), that will add the ability to sync costs with your utility when a tiered tariff is in use. And once we release the ZigBee version of EnergyBuddy that will communicate with compatible smart meters (should include PG&amp;E), then support for tiered tariffs will be automatic if the utility offers cost and tariff data via their smart meter ZigBee communications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Q] ""Is EnergyBuddy compatible with Green Button?""</strong><br/><ul>
<li>We will later have a cloud software update that will add Green Button support (download of your utility data), that will add the ability to sync costs and consumption with your utility.<strong><br/></strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>[Q] ""What's the product warranty?""</strong><br/><ul>
<li>12 months.<strong><br/></strong>
</li>
</ul>

a small, affordable and easy-to-use but stylish electronic gadget that will help you monitor, manage and see how your family uses electricity around the home.

EnergyBuddy's clever technology simply makes your electricity consumption visible - putting you firmly in control of your utility bill.
All this - and loads more - from a neat little box less than 4"" square!
With EnergyBuddy you'll be able to:


Save Electricity: 'see the difference' - make your electricity consumption visible and take control ...

Save Money: 'feel the difference' - reduce your electricity bill as you learn where it goes ...

Save the Planet: 'make a difference' - change your energy usage patterns, reduce your carbon footprint, involve the kids & feel good!
Bringing your electricity to life ...
With a unique glowing 'red, yellow, green' translucent top, EnergyBuddy tells you at a glance whether your consumption is over or under-budget.

It also brings your electricity use to life in far more detail with colorful dashboards showing dials, gizmos, graphs and other neat stuff so that you know exactly where your home's electricity is being used and what you can do to reduce it.

There's also remote on/off control if you've got one or more of our EnergyBuddy SmartPlugs!
And you can get info and control on your iPhone, iPad, Android smartphone or computer screen. As it happens. And get totally secure access from anywhere on the net.

Now that's cooOol!

So far, we've done the R&D and developed fully working pre-production Buddies ...
We're currently totally self-funded and have already developed everything needed to make EnergyBuddy work.
We have been working hard with our manufacturing partner in China since September last year. Injection mold tooling has been fabricated and is undergoing final adjustments. Printed circuit boards have been revised and are now final. And we are just putting the finishing touches to our firmware, cloud software and mobile apps.
The first 100 production samples are being built and we are already working with the first few units from this batch (see our update page for the latest production photos).
PLUS - we've had great feedback since we demonstrated our pre-production Buddies at this year's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas back in January and at other recent events.
AND - our heartfelt thanks to Sarah and Joseph from Engadget (http://www.engadget.com) for stopping by while we were setting up the EnergyBuddy stand at the CEA Line Show in New York just before the show opened.
Read what they had to say, see some great pictures and check out their short video of EnergyBuddy here: http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/26/futuredash-energybuddy-hands-on
And now we need your help!
BUT - to make our dream come true and to get EnergyBuddy into as many homes as possible we need to raise enough commitment to place a volume production order and get EnergyBuddy manufactured at a reasonable cost.
That's where YOU can become a part of this!
We need your contributions for us to place our first production order.
And - we'd love your longer-term involvement and feedback once you've received your EnergyBuddy to help us make it even better!
What will we spend your money on?
Your contribution will effectively be a pre-order. We're offering various combinations of EnergyBuddy options - just take a look at the perks list!
Then - if we hit our project goal - the funding will be used for us to complete regulatory approvals, start volume manufacturing and launch the home energy monitoring revolution!
We expect (if everything goes according to plan) to start shipping the perk Buddies by early November.

FAQ
We've been asked a bunch of questions since this campaign launched - we hope the answers help. We'll add to this list as it grows - if you have a question that isn't on the list below then simply contact us and we'll get you the answer!


[Q] ""How many current transformer clamps are included in the Home Kits?""


Home Kits come with 2 CT (current transformer) clamps and one transmitter.  This is for dual 120V conductors (as is typical in the U.S./ Canada).



[Q] ""How long is the battery assumed to last in the (current transfomer) transmitter?""
About 9 months, and we expect longer with better quality batteries.



[Q] ""What’s the maximum number of SmartPlugs that can be supported by a single EnergyBuddy?""
Theoretically there is no limit that our software can support.  Any limitation will come from the wireless link being used with the sensors and SmartPlugs.
We are using a proprietary 433MHz radio link with our CT clamp transmitter and SmartPlugs, and we are confidently testing with 10 SmartPlugs simultaneously at the moment.
If you need to manage a larger amount of devices, power strips and appliances then we recommend that you use the ZigBee version of EnergyBuddy that will be available later in the year. ZigBee will also be available as an optional upgrade to the initial 433MHz EnergyBuddy via a ZigBee USB dongle that we plan to offer. We will also be recommending, or possibly offering directly, ZigBee enabled SmartPlugs.




[Q] ""What support are you offering for International versions of EnergyBuddy?""

Certified international versions of EnergyBuddy will start to be available, probably by the end of the year. The AC adapter for the gateway is easily swapped for one with the correct plug (they are all universal AC voltage input already). Our CT clamp wireless transmitter supports up to three plug-in CT clamps, so can be used with one clamp for 220V-240V single phase, single conductor supply, two clamps for dual 120V conductors (as is typical in the U.S./ Canada), and three clamps for 3-phase. There will be 3 different sizes of CT clamp available that can support maximum conductor diameters of 15mm, 18mm and 25mm. AC voltage used for power calculations is programmable in our setup app. And a 220V – 240V version of the SmartPlugs already exists, that has options for several of the common plug types, including Schuko. It’s mostly a matter of getting everything certified for the specific countries or regions, and language localization of the software, and as a startup it comes down to cost and time. We are trying to get there as fast as we can, though please bear with us!
In the meantime, our basic Home Kit could be used internationally. The AC adapter for the gateway has universal AC voltage input and would just need an appropriate plug adapter. Although two CT clamps are provided, they are plug in, and so for 220V-240V single phase, single conductor AC supply, like in most of Europe, only one would need to be used. And the AC voltage used for power calculations is programmable in our setup app. Hence as long as the CT clamp will physically fit (maximum conductor size is 18mm for the standard Home Kit), then EnergyBuddy Home Kit (no SmartPlugs) should be useable. Language in the apps and browser dashboards will be U.S. English.  We have added options for international shipping.  However, such international orders will need to be at your own risk and liability, and with the understanding that the product will probably not yet have passed safety and electro-magnetic compatibility certifications for your country (other than the AC adapter). We will do our best to support your installation, and will support a return if it will not work, however we will not be able to cover return shipping costs.
We will also support kits with SmartPlugs for international use in countries with 120V supply, under the same conditions as above. This will include Canada, Mexico and other countries that we will be announcing in due course.
The EnergyBuddy kits will have passed UL or ETL safety certification for the U.S., and FCC Part 15 electro-magnetic compatibility testing.



[Q] ""What Support does EnergyBuddy offer for 3-phase?""

Our CT clamp wireless transmitter supports up to three plug-in CT clamps, so with three clamps can support 3-phase. This gives the total power on all three phases and does not break out power on each phase. There will be 3 different sizes of CT clamp available that can support maximum conductor diameters of 15mm, 18mm and 25mm. AC voltage is programmable in our setup app.
We will setup sales for optional additional CT clamps later on our EnergyBuddy website.



[Q] ""Do you offer support for second or more electrical panels""

Additional electrical panels can be supported with optional add-on sets of CT clamps plus wireless transmitter, which we will make available via the EnergyBuddy website later.  This will also require a cloud software update to be able to designate multiple panels.



[Q] ""Support for PV/solar and other renewable energy generation""

Support for PV and other power generation will be added in a later cloud software update, which will also include support for feed-in tariffs if appropriate. A second set of CT clamps and wireless transmitter, for the output of your inverter, will be required to monitor generation. The CT clamps will be available as an optional add-on, so you can get initially started with an EnergyBuddy kit for monitoring consumption, and add the generation monitoring later.



[Q] ""Is there a ZigBee version of EnergyBuddy?""

The initial version of EnergyBuddy available for pre-ordering uses a proprietary 433MHz wireless link to the CT clamp transmitter and SmartPlugs, and does not include a ZigBee radio.
The ZigBee version of EnergyBuddy will be available later in the year and will also have options to support ZigBee Home Automation Profile, ZigBee Smart Energy Profile or both. And it will be able to support other ZigBee enabled devices compatible with the appropriate Profile. There are already some third party ZigBee smart plugs and other energy sensors / controls that we support and we will announce details of these later. If a specific ZigBee device requires a new dashboard, for example a ZigBee programmable thermostat, then new dashboards can be added via a cloud software and mobile apps update.
For those pre-ordering an EnergyBuddy, we will also later offer a ZigBee upgrade via an optional ZigBee USB dongle.



[Q] ""Can the initial version of EnergyBuddy be upgraded to support ZigBee later?""
For those pre-ordering an EnergyBuddy, we will also later offer a ZigBee upgrade via an optional ZigBee USB dongle.



[Q] ""How can I monitor hard-wired appliances, such as HVAC, and lighting?""

For monitoring hard-wired appliances such as split A/C, electric ovens, lighting etc., there is a third party multi-circuit monitor that we support with the ZigBee version of EnergyBuddy that requires professional installation at the main electrical panel.  We will provide more details on this later.

However, even with our basic Home Kit, it’s easy to get a good idea of the incremental cost of each device or appliance as you switch it on or off, via our mobile apps and browser dashboards.



[Q] ""Does EnergyBuddy offer support for tiered, TOU and utility specific tariff rates?""
General TOU tariffs will be supported in the initial version, though the user will need to manually enter the start and end of each time period and the corresponding rate. In a later cloud software update, we plan to offer the ability for the user to select their appropriate TOU tariff without having to make any manual entries.

For tiered tariffs it is not easy to provide a general way to enter a scheme that will cover the myriad and complexity of tiered tariffs available from the more than 3,000 utility companies in the U.S., and the fact that those schemes may change on a monthly or seasonal basis in some cases. Our recommendation for tiered tariffs is either to set a fixed average rate (cents per kWh) that represents your average rate (usually shown on your utility bill), or to set a fixed rate that represents the cost of the tier that you generally end up in by the end of the billing cycle. The latter at least tells you the rate at which you will be saving if you reduce your usage, until the point that you save enough to drop in to the next lower tier.
We will later have a cloud software update that will add Green Button support (download of your utility data), that will add the ability to sync costs with your utility when a tiered tariff is in use. And once we release the ZigBee version of EnergyBuddy that will communicate with compatible smart meters (should include PG&E), then support for tiered tariffs will be automatic if the utility offers cost and tariff data via their smart meter ZigBee communications.



[Q] ""Is EnergyBuddy compatible with Green Button?""
We will later have a cloud software update that will add Green Button support (download of your utility data), that will add the ability to sync costs and consumption with your utility.




[Q] ""What's the product warranty?""
12 months.

We bring you Go’n Toxic, and we promise this will bring hours of enjoyment to your kids.
Remember the days where you use to stick pegs, plastic, even cans on your push bike to give it the sound of a motor bike? I’m sure most of us at some stage in our life tried it. Well we wanted to take this idea into the 21st century and give children the realism they were looking for. With our product, your child can simply choose what type of motorbike, they wish to simulate.  Eg.. Harley Davidson, Dirt Bike, or other sound effects like UFO. 
The attached exhaust then plays real audio recordings of that bike. It increases and decreases in pitch and tempo as the bike changes its speed. It really does sound like you’re riding a real motorbike! No cheesy digital audio, just the real thing. Your child can ride in style!

<h4><strong>What if I run out of battery in my Smartphone?</strong></h4>
<p>Even if you run out of battery in you Smartphone the pedal will keep working with it's basic function of light emission (red backward and white forward all the time). Of course you won't be able to control it via Smartphone and activate the turn indicator sequence (blinking sequence).</p>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<h4>Does it have any kind of anti-theft incorporated system?</h4>
<p>Altough the pedal itself is a project mainly specialized in safety while riding in urban traffic it does have GPS tracking inside the application, which will allow you to track your position/routes via Smartphone. Beside this we are expecting to include a GPS sensor inside the SmartPedal itself to allow the user to track the position of the bicycle while the SmartPedals are on.</p>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<h4>How much can the body withstand?</h4>
<p>The SmartPedal body was built to withstand regular use and common abuses over the body structure. The top and bottom surfaces are internally reinforced to support the loads generated by the rider and the screen is designed to resist abuses like common impacts or misuse.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h4><b>What is the weight of a pair of SmartPedals?</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>A pair of SmartPedals weights approximately 445 grams/0.98 pounds.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<h4><strong>How intense is the light emission?</strong></h4>
<b></b><p>We have not made a prototype of the internal light guide and consequently the prototype body that you see in the video has a much lower light emission than the finished product and only serves for simulation purposes. Prototyping is allways limited by technology development. In our case, we ensure you that the finished product (including the final lightguide technology) will have 2 to 3 times more light emission intensity and will allow a visibility from at least 20 meters/65 feet away.</p>

<h4>How can I charge the internal battery?</h4>
<p>The final product package will include a charger with USB connectivity, allowing you to charge the batteries using a regular household plug or a USB plug. </p>
<br/><p></p>
<h4>Why isn't the system self sustaining/self recharging?</h4>
<p>Self sustaining/recharging systems require a certain amount of constant outside energy input in order to work properly. The  SmartPedal's internal system packs a great load of integrated technology. We have runned various studies analysing the possibilities to implement a self sustaining system and concluded that it would compromise the user's comfort and the pedal size more than expected. We want SmartPedal to be a product that simplifies the user's life, offering security and freedom on the road and not a product that restricts and complexifies the user's possibilities. Although all of this is true, we are still working and will keep working towards this goal.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Why we need Crowdfunding?</h4>
<p>The SmartPedal Team has set a goal that includes the full process of mass production of the SmartPedal while maintaining a high quality final product and for that we need your help. We want to bring the best to you!</p>

However, we could not find a bike that united our core values; simplicity, ease of use and minimalistic Scandinavian design. So we built it. With the new Movea you get a bike that is beautifully designed for urban riding with easy of use, minimal styling, performance and high quality. All whilst retaining affordability. Our aim is to keep Movea bikes clean and simple but also highly functional. To do this we’ve incorporated practical features like our oil/stain free carbon belt drive and an elegant secure rack for your urban cargo. Power is supplied when you need it by the reliable proven Zehus e-hub. Packed into the beautifully light hub is the motor, self-charging battery and all the smarts that enable you to monitor and control your bike using your mobile phone. Movea is designed by the Danish designer Anders Hermansen, formerly designer at Bang & Olufsen. He worked with us to create a bicycle that perfectly balances comfort, style, performance, quality and affordability.Movea 24"" Mens Movea 20"" WomensMovea 20"" WomensWomens bikes will be delivered in Rubin Metallic. Mens bikes will be delivered in black.Smartphone ControlBluetooth connectivity allows you to connect your smartphone (both iOS and Android are supported) to your Movea to select your favourite power mode, manage your trip and even lock the bike. Motor and BatteryMovea is mounted with the Italian-made Zehus Bike system – a 250W electric motor and 30V lithium ion 160Wh battery in an elegant aluminium hub. Sensors are embedded within the hub to determine how much power assistance to give you (eAssist).Enjoy eAssist  up to 25 km/h (U.S. 15 MPH) with a range of up to 100 km (60 miles). The Zehus Hub self-charges; your bike automatically recharges when you coast downhill or pedal backwards. You also have the possibility to charge it by plugging it in using the included charger - it only takes  3 hours from empty. It adapts completely to your needs.Your MOVEA comes with a proven carbon belt drive. No need to maintenanceOne great advantage of this carbon belt is that it is oil free; you will not have any oil stains on you or if you transport it in your car.Beautiful Scandinavian design, mounted with our practical Movea front rack as a cargo solution The front cargo solution is ideal for keeping an eye on your stuff when you are riding in town.     Smaller wheels but with the geometry of a standard bikeThe size of our bike is designed to match a normal city bike when you compare it at wheelbase and saddle – handlebar. The Movea is specially tailored for riding in traffic and urban areas - more compact smaller wheels give enhanced manouvreability and easier start/stopping.Sizing GuideBoth mens and womens bikes are available in two sizes:20"" wheels for riders 150-185cm tall24"" wheels for riders 160-195+ cm tall

 The train is late—again—and when it finally pulls into the station, it’s packed with so many sweaty faces you have to suck in your stomach just to squeeze inside
Road construction has brought morning traffic to a standstill. As you count your breaths to distract yourself from the meeting you know started five minutes ago, you look out your window wistfully at the motorcycles weaving across the asphalt, slicing between cars like a cocky knife through butter worry about parking spots anymore.
                                             
 After carrying your fixed-gear bike down three flights of stairs and taking the bridge, you’ve finally arrived at the office. You’re not sure whether that feeling tickling your chest is pride, or the slow waterfall of sweat that has staked a claim on your button-up. For that  we design OULOO-BX to be most city commuters you like, It is Small in stature, big in attitude       How is OULOO-BX different from other e-bikes? Glad you asked.!!!LET'S DISCOVER OULOO-BX IN DEPTH Small in stature, big in attitude. OULOO-BX boasts just as much power as its competitors, at a fraction of the size (and cost). 
No road left untraveled—with 12-inch wheels and superior rear suspension, OULOO-BX can ride anywhere your commute takes you.
 

Light as a feather, stiff as aluminum. We use Aluminum 6061, the strongest and lightest form of aluminum available.
Ready, set, charge—not only can one charge carry you up to 60 miles/km/hours[1] , but if your phone or other electronic device needs a boost on the go, you can get a little juice from the USB plug, and keep an eye on battery levels with the LCD screen.
 ●       Easy on the arms. The distance between OULOO-BX’s handlebar and saddle point is 15 cm (5 in) longer than that of other e-bikes, which results in an easier and more ergonomic ride.●       Power seat—An angled saddle not only means greater comfort, but also greater pedal power and stability. 
Leg room—the OULOO-BX saddle is also adjustable up to 195 cm (76 in), which means one size really does fit all.
Can I get an extension? The rear wheel extends back further than most other e-bikes, which performs double-duty, giving you extra stability, especially when you flip on the motor, as well as an easier turning radius.

<p>The largest group of cyclists who will benefit from this new product are the 1 million African bicycle taxi drivers (<em>boda boda</em>, in Kenya). <em>Boda boda</em> earn about $2.50 per day. This leaves them struggling to feed their families and send their children to school. Heavy load haulers carry over 200kg for up to 100km each day and are at risk of being robbed should they have a flat tire. </p>
<p>Because of the poor quality pneumatic tubes and poor road conditions, people earning a living on their bikes suffer two or more flat tires per day. Each flat costs <em>boda boda</em> 25 cents and an hour of lost work. </p>
