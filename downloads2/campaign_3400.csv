Over the last 6 years I have been working on a body of work that I feel exemplifies printmaking at its best. One of the goals of this book is to introduce the art-form to a wider audience and share some of the processes, techniques, and methods I’ve implemented along the way. I’ll be presenting a rare behind-the-scenes look at the drawings, paintings, and printed proofs that have led to the final pieces showcased in the book. Also included in <strong><i>“Quietus”</i> </strong>are elegantly photographed details of my creative practice. These images exemplify the craftsmanship and nuanced marks that goes into each and every one of my images helping to educate and inform readers about what goes into executing one of my intricate prints.</p><p>But this book is much more than a book about printmaking. The autobiographical writings included in <strong><i>“Quietus”</i> </strong>weave together personal experiences with my creative process uncovering the complex emotional journey revealed in my work. As we encounter hardships in our lives, I believe that these moments serve to inform and enlighten us. Our pains and misfortunes have the ability to uncover pivotal moments of illumination and growth. <strong><i>“Quietus”</i> </strong>is a tool for granting permission, allowing our adversities and blemishes to become the celebrated marker of our diverse individuality and shared humanity. My hope is that through my vulnerability, that the art and book will serve as a mirror, reflecting the innermost beauty and divinity of the human spirit, propelling us forward as our highest selves.</p><p><i><strong>“Quietus”</strong></i> will be a hard-bound coffee table style art book measuring 11.25” x 11.25” square with more than 150 pages of content. Each book sold through this fundraiser will contain a specially designed bookplate, individually signed and numbered, as a thank you gift to the patrons of this campaign. Funds raised for this project will go toward the cost of designing, printing, and publishing the highest quality art catalog with the utmost attention paid to the craftsmanship of this multi-year effort. </p><p>This fundraiser is also the <strong>VERY FIRST TIME</strong> I will sell a selection of my <strong>ORIGINAL PRINTS</strong> before they are exhibited! I feel that in giving the supporters of my work the very first opportunity to own an original work of art, I am also showing gratitude to those that have come to know and support the artwork that will be gracing the pages of this beautiful hardbound book.

<p>Beginning in 2007 Producer-Directors Tyler Bastian, Trevor Hill and Tim Skousen embarked on a journey to make a film that tells a story of a man Tyler met in Honduras over a decade ago. ""Everything is Incredible"" is about Agustin, who is physically disabled from polio, yet has spent 50 years building a surprisingly advanced helicopter out of re-bar, bicycle parts and wood. His dream to take flight has inspired us to capture his spirit, attitude, and perspective in an emotional film about determination and the purpose of life goals.</p>

In collaboration with Lancaster Public Art, and funded in part by the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts the project is a direct response to <a href=""http://www.lancastersoundmap.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Lancaster Sound Map</a>. The LSM is a multi-faceted project revealing the diverse character of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Created by artist Stuart Hyatt, the LSM is intended to be a growing platform of free-use content, from which many creative projects may arise.</p><p>Looking at the roots of where Hyatt started his project, we plan to expand on them through a variety of artistic mediums. Over the course of a year, Stuart gathered audio recordings from all around Lancaster County. Along with the FIELDWORKS group of musicians he condensed the recordings into nine original audio tracks. These recordings were collected and made into a vinyl record titled BORN IN THE EAR. </p><p>Using the vinyl record, its packaging, and it’s circular shape as a point of departure, our project will bring together visual art, the written word, and audio documentation. Chapman is to make a series of nine pieces based on walks that he, Kabik, and Downs embark on from nine locations in Lancaster County. Each piece will be created within a circular boarder, exactly the same circumference as a vinyl record. Each walk will be tracked and recorded using GPS, as if they were the drawing tool and the landscape is their paper. The resulting “walk line” will then be incorporated into each of his nine pieces. The content of each will vary based on the experience of the walk and the observations He makes. </p><p>As the record contained a written piece to accompany each track, Chapman's works will be accompanied by a collection of corresponding short stories. Four written by Matthew Kabik, four written by Caitlin Downs, and the 9th will be a collaborative effort between all three artists. Kabik will also be conducting an audio recording of the excursions and capture the genuine nature of the conversations, along with all atmospheric and residual noises. He will then accumulate these into “episodes” that can be accessed and listened to during the project as well as after it’s completion. Creating in a sense, a sound map of our own.</p><p>The final project will culminate into printed and signed editions of the artworks and writings. Each edition will be housed in a heavyweight gatefold album jacket, mimicking a vinyl record. Inside each jacket will hold a series of nine individual prints, one for each of the nine circular pieces created by Chapman. Also contained in the jacket will be the collected short stories written by Downs and Kabik . These collections will be produced in a small run of 100 editions, 50 being available during this campaign, 40 will be made available during a project reception held in Lancaster city, and 10 will be donated to Lancaster Public Art. The original drawings along with their respective short story will be displayed at the Lancaster City Amtrak Station.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493218691/zzpzaqpsjx71iivfzbaa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We have been awarded an artist stipend of $600, as part of Lancaster Public Art’s ongoing efforts to encourage new work, created in response to the Lancaster Sound Map. Funding for this stipend came from a Project Stream Grant awarded to Lancaster Public Art by PCA.</p><p>The amount in this campaign will be used towards the creation of original artworks and short stories.

In collaboration with Lancaster Public Art, and funded in part by the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts the project is a direct response to The Lancaster Sound Map. The LSM is a multi-faceted project revealing the diverse character of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Created by artist Stuart Hyatt, the LSM is intended to be a growing platform of free-use content, from which many creative projects may arise.Looking at the roots of where Hyatt started his project, we plan to expand on them through a variety of artistic mediums. Over the course of a year, Stuart gathered audio recordings from all around Lancaster County. Along with the FIELDWORKS group of musicians he condensed the recordings into nine original audio tracks. These recordings were collected and made into a vinyl record titled BORN IN THE EAR. Using the vinyl record, its packaging, and it’s circular shape as a point of departure, our project will bring together visual art, the written word, and audio documentation. Chapman is to make a series of nine pieces based on walks that he, Kabik, and Downs embark on from nine locations in Lancaster County. Each piece will be created within a circular boarder, exactly the same circumference as a vinyl record. Each walk will be tracked and recorded using GPS, as if they were the drawing tool and the landscape is their paper. The resulting “walk line” will then be incorporated into each of his nine pieces. The content of each will vary based on the experience of the walk and the observations He makes. As the record contained a written piece to accompany each track, Chapman's works will be accompanied by a collection of corresponding short stories. Four written by Matthew Kabik, four written by Caitlin Downs, and the 9th will be a collaborative effort between all three artists. Kabik will also be conducting an audio recording of the excursions and capture the genuine nature of the conversations, along with all atmospheric and residual noises. He will then accumulate these into “episodes” that can be accessed and listened to during the project as well as after it’s completion. Creating in a sense, a sound map of our own.The final project will culminate into printed and signed editions of the artworks and writings. Each edition will be housed in a heavyweight gatefold album jacket, mimicking a vinyl record. Inside each jacket will hold a series of nine individual prints, one for each of the nine circular pieces created by Chapman. Also contained in the jacket will be the collected short stories written by Downs and Kabik . These collections will be produced in a small run of 100 editions, 50 being available during this campaign, 40 will be made available during a project reception held in Lancaster city, and 10 will be donated to Lancaster Public Art. The original drawings along with their respective short story will be displayed at the Lancaster City Amtrak Station.We have been awarded an artist stipend of $600, as part of Lancaster Public Art’s ongoing efforts to encourage new work, created in response to the Lancaster Sound Map. Funding for this stipend came from a Project Stream Grant awarded to Lancaster Public Art by PCA.The amount in this campaign will be used towards the creation of original artworks and short stories. With two thirds of the goal going to the businesses utilized in supplying project materials, and creation of the collected print editions. The final third of our goal going to the artists themselves for their skills and expertise in bringing this vision into reality.Through our thoughtfully crafted (and in some cases one of a kind) perks we have an array of exciting  offerings!

<h3>Project summary</h3>
<p><br/><strong>""a love story"" is a long-format poem in picture book form. </strong><br/><i>written and illustrated by benjamin lee hicks</i></p>
<p>benjamin lee hicks is a visual artist, elementary school teacher and graduate student. They taught junior kindergarten - grade 6 classrooms in the Toronto District School Board for 8 years prior to beginning graduate work in Curriculum Studies and Teacher Development at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto. benjamin has written and designed curriculum materials for elementary schools on topics of sustainable community building, all-gender inclusion and arts-based activism. They are interested in how we might better support teachers to expect queerness and prepare for multi-dimensional gender identity in elementary school classrooms. benjamin’s current research focuses on how faculties of education can teach pre-service teacher candidates to learn about queer identities with direct permission and support to discuss their own feelings, fears and reservations about this topic. They are interested in slowing down the pace at which social justice education is addressed in early teacher training; making room for heart-based processing alongside social and political theory.  </p>

<p>The funds generated from this campaign will assist with the up-front costs of self-publishing, and many of the incentives include one (or several) copies of the completed, 46 page book.</p>
<p><strong>THE STORY of A LOVE STORY:</strong><br/>I wrote the text portion of this book for my grade 2, 3 and 4 students almost 3 years ago. It began as my attempt to have deeper conversations about what the lived experience of BE-ing a presence of empathy, caring and kindness in the world might FEEL like... How this might feel differently to each of us based on our own experiences... how we could talk, draw, write about these ideas, and how they might play out in our lives together. These were conversations that I was privileged to continue with the same students over the next two years as I completed the illustrations (and eventually the layout) for this book. This short-run, self-published version represents the story's first few steps into the wider world, and I would love for it to continue to  be shared.</p>
<p><strong>Here is an excerpt from the book/poem to peak your interest</strong>:</p>
<p>Our thoughts combined with our actions are power-full.<br/>In the full-ness : potential.<br/>Potential energy to fuel our thoughts and our actions;<br/>Potential of intent and for individual choice. <br/> <br/>We can choose ways of thinking and being that will others good-ness,<br/>or those that intend them harm.<br/>We can dedicate our BE-ing to the creation of greater LOVE in the world,<br/>or to actions that create hate.<br/>This potential is in all of us,<br/>and it does not go away by pretending that it is not there.<br/><br/>Ignoring this power (intentional ignor-ance) creates apathy.<br/>Apathy is a calculated lack of caring,<br/>and that is also a choice.<br/><br/>EVEN WHEN IT IS HARD,<br/>we have a choice.<br/>ESPECIALLY when it is hard,<br/>we have a responsibility;<br/>A responsibility to be aware of the kind of energy <br/>that we put out into the world with every choice.<br/><br/>MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE <br/>WE WANT TO LOVE AND BE LOVED…<br/>more than ANYTHING else.<br/><br/>But we are also human,<br/>and we are also flawed,<br/>and sometimes we go about it all from the long and backwards way around.</p>

Our thoughts combined with our actions are power-full.In the full-ness : potential.Potential energy to fuel our thoughts and our actions;Potential of intent and for individual choice.  We can choose ways of thinking and being that will others good-ness,or those that intend them harm.We can dedicate our BE-ing to the creation of greater LOVE in the world,or to actions that create hate.This potential is in all of us,and it does not go away by pretending that it is not there.Ignoring this power (intentional ignor-ance) creates apathy.Apathy is a calculated lack of caring,and that is also a choice.EVEN WHEN IT IS HARD,we have a choice.ESPECIALLY when it is hard,we have a responsibility;A responsibility to be aware of the kind of energy that we put out into the world with every choice.MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WE WANT TO LOVE AND BE LOVED…more than ANYTHING else.But we are also human,and we are also flawed,and sometimes we go about it all from the long and backwards way around.

Two days later another body is found near the shores of Hollow's Lake, both women discovered in compromising positions. Now the boring town of Murdoch has become a town of terror. When authorities release a connection to the victims, Blair is impregnated with sudden panic. Like her, the two women were with child. A killer stalks the streets, with a motive more terrifying than Blair or any woman could ever imagine.</p>

<p>The gallery will act as a window to emerging photography from Australia and New Zealand for photography enthusiasts in Europe. As well as providing the opportunity for Australian and New Zealand Photographers to gain exposure in the European market. </p>
<p>We have found a location for our gallery on Linienstrasse in Berlin Mitte, which is one of the more established 'gallery districts' in Berlin. Its proximity to other galleries and central location will ensure good exposure for the gallery and the photographers who show their work there. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.michaeldooney.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michael Dooney</a> is an artist, architectural lighting designer and photography enthusiast from Perth, Western Australia. After working 10 years at an electrical consultancy firm in Perth, he relocated to Germany to complete a Master in Architectural Lighting Design. After a period in Hamburg he moved to Berlin where he has been working as a freelance lighting designer for a number of reputable Architects and Lighting Design offices.</p>
<p>For over ten years Michael has been actively involved in the cultural sector in both Perth and Berlin. During his time in Perth he was involved with the local music scene as both a musician, manager and promoter. His photography later provided him the opportunity to exhibit at the Perth Centre for Photography, with his first solo exhibition included in the FotoFreo 2008 Festival of Photography. </p>
<p>As an expatriate Australian living in Europe he was witnessed first hand the increased competition artists face here as opposed to at home. With Galerie Pavlova he wishes to provide an opportunity for Australian and New Zealand contemporary photographers to gain exposure for their work outside the usual channels. </p>

<p>Anyone who has ever started their own business knows that there are many up front costs which need to be taken care of to ensure its long term success. After consulting with a business planner we have determined what our major and ongoing expenses are and written up a budget.</p>
<p>We are approaching the <a href=""http://www.ibb.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Investment Bank of Berlin</a> to secure a start-up loan to help cover many of our initial costs. However to reduce this financial burden we are also reaching out to the crowd-funding community to help get this project off the ground and guarantee its first year of operation. </p>
<p>In addition to the ongoing costs, such as renting the gallery and shipping of art works from Australia &amp; New Zealand to Germany, we also have to allow for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Upgrade the Lighting (ca. 3000€ to 4000€)</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Furnishing the Gallery (ca. 1000€ to 2000€)</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Signage</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Business Registration</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Promotional and Marketing Material (ca. 1000€)</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Advertising the first exhibitions</span></li>
</ul>
<p>With a budget of €5000 we hope to upgrade the lighting to the gallery space to best present the art work. We have met with a local (Berlin based) luminaire manufacturer to develop the best solution for the space within the small budget. LED will not be possible at this stage, however we have designed a system which can be upgraded at a later date. </p>

<p>In the future we also hope to organise an exchange between photographers from Germany, Australia and New Zealand - whereby photographers from each region would travel to the other photographers respective locations to produce work and an eventual exhibition. The idea being to further explore the cultural exchange possibilities of the gallery and the interaction between the artists and the public.  </p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Many thanks for your interest in this project and we hope to see you at our opening!</h4></span></span></span></span></div>","Thanks for checking our campaign. We are in the midst of establishing Europe's first Gallery for showcasing contemporary photography from Australia and New Zealand in Berlin and throughout Europe.
The gallery will act as a window to emerging photography from Australia and New Zealand for photography enthusiasts in Europe. As well as providing the opportunity for Australian and New Zealand Photographers to gain exposure in the European market. 
We have found a location for our gallery on Linienstrasse in Berlin Mitte, which is one of the more established 'gallery districts' in Berlin. Its proximity to other galleries and central location will ensure good exposure for the gallery and the photographers who show their work there.

Michael Dooney is an artist, architectural lighting designer and photography enthusiast from Perth, Western Australia. After working 10 years at an electrical consultancy firm in Perth, he relocated to Germany to complete a Master in Architectural Lighting Design. After a period in Hamburg he moved to Berlin where he has been working as a freelance lighting designer for a number of reputable Architects and Lighting Design offices.
For over ten years Michael has been actively involved in the cultural sector in both Perth and Berlin. During his time in Perth he was involved with the local music scene as both a musician, manager and promoter. His photography later provided him the opportunity to exhibit at the Perth Centre for Photography, with his first solo exhibition included in the FotoFreo 2008 Festival of Photography. 
As an expatriate Australian living in Europe he was witnessed first hand the increased competition artists face here as opposed to at home. With Galerie Pavlova he wishes to provide an opportunity for Australian and New Zealand contemporary photographers to gain exposure for their work outside the usual channels. 
 




  Our first exhibition is planned for November and we are pleased to 
announce that we will be presenting the work of Melbourne based 
photographer Polixeni Papapetrou and her series Between Worlds.
Details of the opening will be sent closer to the date, however you can 
see more of her work on her website: http://www.polixenipapapetrou.net/


Anyone who has ever started their own business knows that there are many up front costs which need to be taken care of to ensure its long term success. After consulting with a business planner we have determined what our major and ongoing expenses are and written up a budget.
We are approaching the Investment Bank of Berlin to secure a start-up loan to help cover many of our initial costs. However to reduce this financial burden we are also reaching out to the crowd-funding community to help get this project off the ground and guarantee its first year of operation. 
In addition to the ongoing costs, such as renting the gallery and shipping of art works from Australia & New Zealand to Germany, we also have to allow for the following:

Upgrade the Lighting (ca. 3000€ to 4000€)
Furnishing the Gallery (ca. 1000€ to 2000€)
Signage
Business Registration
Promotional and Marketing Material (ca. 1000€)
Advertising the first exhibitions

With a budget of €5000 we hope to upgrade the lighting to the gallery space to best present the art work. We have met with a local (Berlin based) luminaire manufacturer to develop the best solution for the space within the small budget. LED will not be possible at this stage, however we have designed a system which can be upgraded at a later date. 



  
Any funds remaining from the crowd funding will be put towards essential furniture and promoting the first exhibition. However it is envisaged that the majority of the crowd funding will go towards the lighting system.




One of our goals for the first year of operation is to take part in the European Month of Photography, which is hosted in Berlin every two years. Participation in this event will provide great exposure for our photographers and give Galerie Pavlova international recognition. In addition to the European Month of Photography, we will also be applying to the Unseen Photofair in Amsterdam, which promotes not only emerging photography but also emerging collectors.

                 
The location of the gallery will also allow it to receive exposure during the other art fairs in Berlin which take place throughout the year such as:


Gallery Weekend Berlin 


Browse FotoFestival 

Berlin Art Week

Art Berlin Contemporary




                 



We want to organise workshops and assist artists from Australia and New Zealand to make the trip over here so they can personally promote their work and connect with the audience in Berlin.
In the future we also hope to organise an exchange between photographers from Germany, Australia and New Zealand - whereby photographers from each region would travel to the other photographers respective locations to produce work and an eventual exhibition. The idea being to further explore the cultural exchange possibilities of the gallery and the interaction between the artists and the public.  


In addition to being part of establishing the first contemporary photography gallery dedicated to Australian and New Zealand photography, located in the heart of Berlin:



No matter where you are in the world (meaning that postage is included) all contributions over 10€ will receive a hand written postcard personally thanking them for their support. Which works out to be less than 1€ per month over the year, not a bad deal to be one of the early adopters!

Do you like to collect postcards from all the exhibitions that you visit? Wish that you were able to pick up one for each of our shows? The 49€ postcard subscription is just that, so for each exhibition that we have throughout the year (6 planned), you will receive a copy in the mail. As well as the hand written thankyou postcard thanking you for your support.




Membership to Galerie Pavlova shows your true support for Australian and New Zealand contemporary photography. Membership is a standard price of 89€ for one year or 7,42€ per month or 1,72€ per week or 0,24€ per day, depending how you want to look at it.
In return we will place a link from our page to your website acknowledging your contribution and commitment to the promotion of Australian and New Zealand contemporary photography in Europe. This link will remain on the website indefinitely with a new list added each year for new members. 
Another special gift for members is the Official Galerie Pavlova hand made screen printed bag from FS Screen Printing. Each bag is individually made in Berlin my mahaila in her studio. Check her store on Etsy to see her other creations. 
 
All gallery memberships of course include the post card subscription as well as a hand written thank you card, acknowledging your support. 


Since 2011 I have been working on a project about the Volkspark Friedrichshain in Berlin, documenting my experience of the European landscape from my Australian foreign perspective. In particular the change in the seasons, which is much more visual and dramatic than what I am used to coming from Perth Western Australia. It will still be some months and possibly years before the series reaches its conclusion, however as part of the fund raising campaign for Galerie Pavlova I am offering for the first time limited edition prints from this body of work. 
This photo was taken on the 9th of November in 2012 on one of the rare sunny Autumn days, which presents the beautiful colours of the changing leaves against a clear blue sky. The low angle of the sun at this time of year has a different quality to that in summer, making it all the more special when it makes an appearance. 
I am offer the above image in a limited number of 10 images for the purpose of the campaign. The image will be a traditional c-print hand printed in the dark room where all of my film is developed in Berlin. The museum quality photo is printed on Fujicolor Crystal Archive Professional Paper, on of the few remaining traditional paper types still available. Paper size will be 40cm x 50cm, with the image being approximately 38cm x 38cm. Allowing it to be either cut to square and framed, or remain in a polaroid orientation. The photo can be delivered any where in the world, subject to additional shipping costs.



In addition to the aforementioned art print, I am also preparing a series of smaller ink-jet prints in the autumn theme. The above images were taking during 2011 and 2012 as part of the series and present another perspective of the seasonal change. 
These prints will only be available as part of the campaign and as a complete set of 9 individual images. Photos will be printed on Fujicolor Crystal Archive Paper for best colour reproduction and longevity. Paper size of 18cm x 24cm will final image size of approximately 16cm x 16cm - allowing for framing both in square format or polaroid style. The set of images can be delivered any where in the world, subject to additional shipping costs. 
All limited edition images will be individually signed and numbered. This offer is unique to the crowd funding campaign and will not be available any where else. 


As a special offer to help raise funds for the gallery, I will be offering lighting design consultations at a reduced cost of 79€ for a two hour session. This is aimed at artists, gallery owners, independent architectural practices and other people who would not normally be able to afford the services of a trained lighting designer.
In this time we can discuss any questions that you may have about lighting, such as the different luminaires and lamp types which are available; explain the different qualities of light such as colour rendering, colour temperature and its other properties. There is also the possibility to work through any lighting problems that may have been presented to you in your work. 
I am designing the lighting for the gallery so that the photography can be presented in the best light possible. Not only do we want to showcase the best in contemporary Australian and New Zealand photography, we also want to lead the way in small gallery boutique style lighting. 


   
For 59€ you can book a personal 1 on 1 portrait photography session, in which we would produce 3-5 images of your choice and delivered digitally at the resolution suitable for making 10x15cm reproductions. 
Primarily I work with medium format analogue (film) cameras, which although do not offer the immediacy of their digital counterparts, allow me to work in a more organic and thoughtful way. I prefer the natural look that comes with this technique and do minimal retouching, aiming to create an authentic portrait of the sitter. 
Although I am based in Berlin, I am often in Hamburg and I am able to travel to other parts of Germany. For those not in the area, if you wish you can purchase a portrait session in advance to fund the gallery and use it when you are next in this region.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>About a month ago, I got a long awaited email response from the coordinators of the <strong>Adelaide Fringe Festival</strong> in Australia. The news? I had been accepted to cover the event. Not just any event. This was the Adelaide Fringe Festival, the second largest Fringe in the world, home to countless artistic acts, all vying for audience’s attention, for a chance to reveal their craft and their talent to the world. </p>
<p>I couldn’t wait to help make that happen, through Infectious Magazine.</p>
<p>But since our inception nearly four years ago, and through the coverage of hundreds of local and national bands, we’ve always run on passion. Pure passion and heart. We run on the spark that comes from helping young, emerging artists of all kinds break into their industry. We’ve been lucky to cover many U.S. and U.K. based acts, but as so many artists know, this is not something you get into for the financial gain. And that’s why we need your help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We’ve launched this campaign solely to cover airfare costs (and maybe a few PBJ sandwiches along the way!). Luckily, we have a place to crash when we get there, but Australia is extremely expensive to get to from Boston, MA. We know that with your help we can make it happen, and bring artists one step closer to getting the public recognition they deserve through our website, our radio show which is currently on PoochFM (home of several shows by members the <strong>Margera</strong> family and co-run by <strong>CKY</strong> members) and throughout our social media and various partnerships.</p>
<p>For those who are able to donate to our campaign, we have some really <strong>unique, one time only rewards packages</strong> that are <strong>awesome for both fans AND bands.</strong> We have a great mix, including several prizes that come straight from the cause you’ll be helping make happen. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand money is tight (hey, that’s why we’re here!). So if you’re unable to donate, or even if you are, we ask that you please, please spread our message. Every tweet, every share, every “like” or post on Tumblr really helps our cause in not only covering Fringe Festival, but in helping us gain access to bands all around the world to share their story, and their music with you.</p>
<p>We thank you for your time and consideration. It means a lot, and we are grateful for your support.</p>

I admire her passion.” - Michael Longoria (Percussionist – Patty Griffin)
Michael P Falk is a songwriter and performer with Les Jupes, the owner of Head In The Sand Records, a record producer, and former Artistic Director of the West End Cultural Centre.  His songwriting alternates between gentle acoustic ballads and driving indie rock, and his work to support and grow the local music community has had him dubbed “the patron-saint of the Winnipeg music scene” (Jaxon Haldane, d.Rangers)
Florian Vorreiter started his apprenticeship in Austria and continued his lutherie studies at university in Germany. After his graduation in 2008, he opened his own workshop in Winnipeg and a store last year. His instruments span a broad range of styles and types, but they are all characterized by his love for hand tools and traditional craftsmanship, a certain obsession with artistic detail and a relentless drive to fuse artistry with instrument making.

<p><strong>WHAT</strong></p>
<p>It is our goal to form an artist’s residency titled, <em>Women’s Residency for</em> <em>Transmodern Awareness. </em>The residency will take place during August of 2013 at Seneca State Forest, and intend to meditate on the theme of female collaboration and ritual in nature by use of the natural environment and formal workshops. The purpose of this curatorial artist residency is to create an available space for women artists to research how their work responds to a natural environment when removed from the constant stimulus of technology culture. The residency is catered to women (or anyone who identifies as so) in order to reflect on the female perspective in nature and as juxtaposed in contemporary art.</p>
<p>In the course of this residency, we will examine possibilities in which artists may utilize organic forms of nature and female collaboration in relation to contemporary art practice. Through <em>transmodernism,</em> the philosophical movement that seeks to reactivate a place for arcane in contemporary society, artists may embrace esoteric techniques of art making that simultaneously pertain to contemporary art. The artists will be encouraged to be transmodern in their approach, distinctly reacting to various forms of ritual used in cultural and spiritual traditions as well as their immediate surroundings in order to materialize a place of hermetic modernity through transcendental awareness.</p>
<p><strong>WHY</strong></p>
<p>Civilization and the advancement of technology have brought forth endless opportunities and information to promote the quality of life. However, at this period in history it is all the more urgent to sift through the static “noise” of television, internet, and electronic based information and realize the ability to use these available medias to the best of creative cognition. The most available way to realize this ability is to detach oneself from these medias and retreat to primitive nature in the place where art and spirituality were first born. Silence is used as an essential realization practice in a number of cultures around the world. In the heart of Zen Buddhism, there is a practice called, <em>Zazen, </em>in which one attempts to suspend all images, judgments, and distractions from their thought in order to gain the insight of silence and the nature of existence. Among Native American cultures there is a practice called, <em>Vision Quest</em>, which calls one to partake in a vocational journey to survive in the wilderness alone in order to understand their intended direction in life. The residency will be a space of reflection and absorption that offers the means of esoteric creation. By researching the effects of physical and figurative silence in a natural environment, we hope to discover how an artist’s experience and inspiration transforms their work in comparison to the antithesis, and to formulate a proposal in which one can utilize transmodernism to appropriate the balance of mystic and modernity in the creation of their artwork.</p>
<p><strong>HOW</strong></p>
<p>We will invite artists of every medium based on their merit and interest to live and work together within the natural grounds provided in Seneca State Forest for a period no longer than five days. The artists will direct and attend daily workshops, which will address how the meditation of will is used as a technique within different cultures and spiritualities while they work on a specific piece relative to the duration of the residency. The artwork created in collective will be presented for a group show in the Fall of 2013.</p>
<p>Artists who have created similar inspired works from which I have gained inspirations from include: <em>The Center for the Advancement of Transmodern Awareness. <a href=""http://rocketgrants.org/rocket-grants-projects/the-recipients/the-center-for-the-advancement-of-transmodern-awareness/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">C.A.T.A</a></em> is an experimental artist’s space that serves as a venue for performances, lectures, workshops, free-school programming, and experiments. <em>C.A.T.A’s</em> mission is to manifest a transmodern reality through cultivating curiosity and self-awareness.</p>
<p>Workshops will take place during the residency to enrich the study of the effects that the rituals in nature impress on an artist’s work. An example of the first workshop will be the focus on the actualization of silence itself, in which the artists will be called together to perform a day of silence where they will work together abstaining from using vocal language as a tool for communication. The remaining workshops will be based on the observation of color, sound, spirit, and psyche in the natural surroundings, the influence of meditative and ritual practices used by several cultures and spiritualities, and field trips within the surrounding areas in order to build a strong community of artists to aid in the productions of artwork.</p>

<p>There has been hard work going on during the whole process of creation of <i>VISION</i>. We have undertaken this project attending fully on the quality of the final result, both on the content and the presentation. One of the most important decisions we made was launching <i>VISION</i> in a limited edition, to create something special other than a simple book.</p>
<p>Due to the small amount of copies and the quality of them, the cost of producing is higher than a normal book. We decided that the best way to produce is was through crowdfunding, generating this way a direct relationship between the creators and the customers.</p>
<p>Our goal using crowdfunding for this project is to print <i>VISION</i> and so it can come to life in a physical format, something the crew is excited about and is fond of achieving. We strongly believe that for the customer, this can be a really good opportunity to get hold of an exclusive and valuable piece.</p>

<p>El proceso de gestación de Vision ha sido muy laborioso. Hemos emprendido este proyecto atendiendo principalmente a la calidad del resultado final, tanto por el contenido como por la presentación. Una de las decisiones más importantes que tomamos fue la de lanzar <i>VISION</i> en edición limitada a pocas copias, para así crear algo más especial que un simple libro. </p>
<p>Debido a la poca cantidad de copias y al acabado seleccionado, el coste de producción es más elevado que el de un libro normal. Por ello decidimos que la mejor manera de producirlo era mediante un crowdfunding, generando así una relación directa entre creadores y compradores.</p>
<p>Nuestro objetivo a la hora de pedir apoyo en este proyecto es imprimir <i>VISION</i> y que vea la luz de manera física, algo que queremos que ocurra y que nos ilusiona al equipo que ha trabajado en ello. Creemos que para los compradores esta aportación puede ser una muy buena oportunidad para hacerse con una pieza exclusiva y valiosa</p>

VISION “The black book of secrets and tricks” is a limited to 333 copies edition book. It runs through graffiti and the experiences of Dems333, who discovers himself in this book with the best kept secrets he has from the last 20 years.



VISION “The black book of secrets and tricks” es un libro de edición limitada a 333 copias. Se trata de un recorrido por el graffiti y las vivencias de Dems333, que se descubre en este libro desvelando algunos de los secretos mejor guardados de estos últimos 20 años.






                  




DEMS was born in Elche, Spain, in 1979. Since the early 90’s he met graffiti and started painting. More than 20 years in which he has never stopped inventing and developing styles, with a frenetic activity that has taken him to paint all around the world. There is no doubt that due to all this effort he has made his way into the international graffiti scenario. In VISION he will be leading the project that he has made and will bring it to life.
VELVET LIGA is a Spanish blog born 5 years ago and is nowadays a doubtless reference in the national and European scenario.
In Velvet Liga we simply love graffiti, tags, throw-ups, immense murals… We are interested in the new proposals the streets have, under any form or any label anyone wants to put on it. We like art, music, design, fashion, any creation that can cause emotion. We have been talking about each of these things since 2008 in a distended way, trying to be rigorous and maintaining our subjective opinion as a statement.
In this project we collaborate as producers, as in the elaboration of the texts with Alberto Martín.
                                                                 


DEMS nació en Elche, España en 1979. Desde principios de los 90 conoció el graffiti y empezó a pintar. Más de 20 años en los que no ha dejado de inventar y desarrollar estilos, con una actividad frenética que le ha llevado a pintar en medio mundo. No cabe duda de que gracias a todo este esfuerzo, se ha hecho con un hueco dentro del panorama internacional.
En VISION, se encargará de dirigir al equipo para que se haga realidad el proyecto que él mismo ha ideado.
VELVET LIGA es un blog español que nació hace 5 años y pronto se colocó como un referente indiscutible en el panorama nacional y europeo.
En Velvet Liga nos apasiona el graffiti, tags, throw-ups, los murales inmensos. Nos interesan las nuevas propuestas que se plantean en la calle, sea de la forma que sea y bajo la etiqueta que cada cual le quiera poner. Nos gusta el arte, la música, el diseño, la moda, cualquier creación que despierte en nosotros emoción. Llevamos hablando de todas estas cosas desde finales del 2008 de una manera distendida, procurando ser rigurosos, y manteniendo la máxima de la no objetividad.
En este proyecto colaboramos como productores y también en la elaboración de los textos, junto a Alberto Martín.




                        


VISION is presented in 160 pages in black and white with different quality materials in its paper, divided in 7 chapters, images and ideas, 7 “VISIONS” that the author Dems has wanted to show to us. It will be launched on a unique limited edition of 333 copies that the author will number and sign. Inside we will find a run through graffiti and the experiences that come along with it with a nice bunch of unpublished material. All of this turns this book into a collector’s exclusive piece.
We will also be able to enjoy the featuring of:
F.Pantone, Sozyone Gonzalez, Rosh333, Kiler, Daniel Muñoz “San”, Aigor, Sawe, KoolFunc´88...


VISION se presenta en 160 páginas en blanco y negro de distintas calidades, divididas en 7 capítulos, imágenes e ideas reflejadas en 7 ‘visiones’ que el propio Dems ha querido mostrarnos. Se lanzará una edición limitada a 333 copias que el autor numerará y firmará. En él podremos ver un recorrido por el graffiti y las vivencias que conlleva con una buena cantidad de material inédito. Todo ello hace de este libro una pieza exclusiva de coleccionista.
Además se podrá disfrutar de las colaboraciones entre otros de:
F.Pantone, Sozyone Gonzalez, Rosh333, Kiler, Daniel Muñoz “San”, Aigor, Sawe, KoolFunc´88...

The original concept was the creation of Mat Millett, Kris Smith, and Ethan Manach, other invaluable members include Joey Mars, Andrew Jacob, Shawn Morris, Scott Bruns,Lessposh. With a simple goal in mind, getting people excited about a night of art, new work from friends/favorite artists etc. Getting people involved in collecting art and becoming part of the art world. We enjoy showcasing the unseen talent of the Outer Cape, contemporary, outsider, lowbrow artists and giving them a platform to present their work and having a bit of fun in the process. <br/><br/>After 4 Amazing years in the Whaler's Wharf space, we have closed those doors as of the January 1st 2013.<br/><br/>Not to worry, HTWS will be opening a new, larger work space with the emphasis on the ""workshop"" aspect of HTWS. A 900 square foot industrial space that would be a perfect home for our working studio. We are a diverse group, so we need a multimedia workspace. A spray booth, a screen printing press, mold-making/casting and more, stuff you can't really make in your living room. <br/><br/><strong> </strong><br/><br/><strong>The Impact</strong><br/><br/>In the short term, the studio will provide local artists the space to work on projects for upcoming deadlines and exhibitions.<br/><br/>In the long term, the space will be used to host art classes and workshops, rental space for visiting artist and a home base for ""HTWS presents"" promotions.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><strong>What We Need</strong><br/><br/>We are looking to raise $10,000, which will help to maintain the space, contribute to the rent, utilities and supplies to get the studio up and running. We are all working artists, so we don't have all the funds to get the studio jump started.<br/><br/>Here's a breakdown of some of the basic costs that this campaign will help fund:<br/><br/>Rent is $950 per month<br/><br/>Utilities are about $100 per month<br/><br/>Construction costs to section off stations for screen printing and other work space will run approximately $600<br/><br/>Screen printing set up, press, chemicals, screens, ink (some of which we have, but are reoccurring costs) $1200+<br/><br/>Basic studio supplies lights, tape, paint, etc. $400+<br/><br/>It should take us about a month to get the Studio assembled, to be able to fully utilize the space.<br/><br/>Other donations will help to keep the space running smoothly, upcoming shows and exhibitions, etc.<br/><br/></p>

I have already received international recognition for my art, and I plan to continue my career. I will participate in several international competitions, and I plan a new exhibition to raise more money for charity. 
  
What I Need, and Your Perks! My 2015 dream is to participate in the Spoleto Festival USA and Piccolo Spoleto Festival this May. The funds you pledge will help me acquire the necessary materials, tickets and accommodation for myself and my parents. If I don't manage to raise all the funds, everything you give me will be used to purchase materials (acrylic paints, brushes, canvas, etc.) and to fund my way into art school.
Please check below the funding tiers and their perks.


€1 - Thanks for supporting the campaign!  You get my heartfelt gratitude for being generous!
€5 - Thanks for supporting me. Your name will be mentioned on my Paul Jules Butler website, and on my Facebook fan page. 
€25 - You will receive a thank you postcard, depicting one of my favorite artworks.  This includes the cost of postage, for local and international fans alike. You also get my heartfelt gratitude, a mention on my website and on my Facebook fan page.
€50 - You will receive a 10x15 cm poster on acrylic glass of one of  my paintings. This includes the cost of shipping (and shipping supplies). You also get a postcard, as well as my heartfelt gratitude, a mention on my website and on my Facebook fan page.
€100 - You will receive an original artwork by me, 18x24 cm, acrylic on canvas. This includes the cost of shipping (and shipping supplies).  You also get a postcard, as well as my heartfelt gratitude, a mention on my website and on my Facebook fan page.
€250 - You will receive an original artwork by me, 30x40 cm, acrylic on canvas. This includes the cost of shipping (and shipping supplies). You also get a postcard, as well as my heartfelt gratitude, a mention on my website and on my Facebook fan page.



Shipping
Shipping for all contributors is included in your perk, so no need to send anything additional!   Most everyone should get their perks by May 2015.  International shipping does take a little bit longer, so some of you may see yours in June.  
Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help!  You can spread the word about this campaign to anyone you think might be interested. Thanks for your support in helping me to help others!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Naomi Harwin </p>
</div></div>","Hi, my name is Naomi Harwin this year I graduated from Norwich University of the arts where I studied Fine Art and in July I was offered a graduate residency at Airspace Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent.
SOLO EXHIBITION 
As part of the residency, in January I will have my first Solo exhibition.  In exchange for some of my art I would love your help in supporting the creation of the works to be shown in this exhibition. 
In August I moved from Cambridgeshire to Hanley to begin my 6-month residency with Airspace.  Over this time the program has provided a studio space and regular support meetings which has allowed me to focus and continue my practice, while providing valuable professional development.  Throughout the program I have covered my materials as well as living cost, but as I begin to prepare for the solo show, your support would be of great assistance in enabling me to produce the work to its full potential. Your donations will help in covering the cost of materials, aiding the production and installation of the work as well as advertising the show.  
I hope to make this a fantastic exhibition!
The first solo exhibition is a milestone in every artist's career, which is why it is such an exciting and significant opportunity.   While beneficial for my own career I hope that my residency show will also aid and promote the rising cultural profile of Stoke-On-Trent. As organisations such as Airspace Gallery aim to encourage graduates and artist to live and work in the area through their residencies, projects and events.  Looking to establish a hub of creative activities.
REWARDS
In exchange for your donations I am offering a range of postcards, digital prints, drawings and paintings and an invitation to my exhibition at Airspace Gallery in January.  All the rewards on offer give a taster of the works you will be supporting for the exhibition.  
Another way that you can support my campaign is through sharing it with your friends and family, this would be extremely helpful in expanding the awareness of my exhibition and campaign. 
MY PRACTICE  
Here is a little bit about my work.
My process-based practice sets out to investigate our relationship with objects and spaces, through the creation of my own forms. Most recently, I have been focusing particularly on the processing of visual stimuli, striking up a dialogue between a form and its represented image.
Examining the transference of information from a three-dimensional form to a two-dimensional plane, I explore the role of the representation and its ability to inform our understanding of our environment.
Studying and extracting the features of the three-dimensional form, each work reveals a snippet of information about the original object.  Both the form and its representations are deconstructed separated into layers of information, which then triggers the construction of new arrangements.

I have found that making work on this residency at Airspace, my process feels much more fluid and engaging and it has been the most enjoyable experience of making work I have found so far.  I have lots of ideas for works that I am hoping to soon materialize and I would be extremely grateful of your support.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""> <h3>Who?</h3><p>Loser Slam is the longest running poetry slam 
in New Jersey, just nine years young.  National slam scoring is based on
 a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 being the worst and 10 being the best, but 
Loser Slam does it backwards, to humble poets while they ""check their 
egos at the door.""  This year Loser Slam hosted a season of FREE writing
 workshops, poetry open mics and slams at Two River Theater in Red Bank,
 NJ.  Poets wrote, edited, and polished their performances in order to 
qualify to compete in the final grand slam.  The top four poets of that 
final slam advance to the next level, National Poetry Slam, creating the
 2014 Loser Slam Team: LowSir.</p><br/><p>LowSir Poets: TruLyfe, Savon Bartley, Jonathan Ware, and Linette Reeman</p><br/><h3>What?</h3><p>Poetry
 Slam is a competition started in the 1980s by a construction worker 
named Marc Smith. [“So what?!”]  The first National Poetry Slam took 
place in San Francisco in 1990, consisting of just three teams and has 
since grown to include 72 teams from infinity and beyond (but mostly, 
North America and sometimes other continents).  This year, National 
Poetry Slam returns to the Bay Area.</p><br/><h3>Where?</h3><p>This year the National Poetry Slam is in Oakland, California, which is approximately 3080 miles away from Red Bank, New Jersey.</p><br/><h3>When?</h3><p>National Poetry Slam 2014 happens from August 5th through the 9th.</p><p>Rewards will be sent between August and September.</p><br/><h3>Why?</h3><p>Do
 you love poetry? [""Yes!""] Do you love artistic communities?? [""Yes!""] 
Do you love the people headlining this year's Loser Slam team??? 
[""YES!""] Do you want to see those three things come together in an 
explosion of creativity and general awesomeness?????? [""YES!!!!!!""] 
Well, then you've answered your own internal questions.</p><br/><h3>How?</h3><p>Since
 May, we have been working with our coach MaryCae to hone our craft even
 further, while writing new group poems, while practicing relentlessly, 
while drinking water and eating Nilla Wafers.  We feel ready to 
represent our corner of the country, but we need help from our 
community. </p><p>As you could imagine, the trip to Oakland is a lotta 
bit expensive.  If you have extra change stuck in the couch cushions, a 
silver dollar that’s actually worth fifty, or some frequent flyer miles 
we could use, we would be incredibly grateful. </p><p>We some nifty 
prizes to offer our contributors such as TShirts, a team chapbook, audio
 of our poems, one of a kind artwork by local artists, and Linette will 
even dye her hair the color of your choice (sending a video and photos 
of the process).</p><p>Our expenses are roughly: $3500 for five people 
to flap their wings across the country in an actual aeroplane, $1000 for
 poets to sleep and shower at a hotel, and $500 to register the team to 
compete. </p><br/><p>You can find LowSir performing at fundraising shows in New Jersey:</p><ul>

</h3></div>","Who?Loser Slam is the longest running poetry slam 
in New Jersey, just nine years young.  National slam scoring is based on
 a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 being the worst and 10 being the best, but 
Loser Slam does it backwards, to humble poets while they ""check their 
egos at the door.""  This year Loser Slam hosted a season of FREE writing
 workshops, poetry open mics and slams at Two River Theater in Red Bank,
 NJ.  Poets wrote, edited, and polished their performances in order to 
qualify to compete in the final grand slam.  The top four poets of that 
final slam advance to the next level, National Poetry Slam, creating the
 2014 Loser Slam Team: LowSir.LowSir Poets: TruLyfe, Savon Bartley, Jonathan Ware, and Linette ReemanWhat?Poetry
 Slam is a competition started in the 1980s by a construction worker 
named Marc Smith. [“So what?!”]  The first National Poetry Slam took 
place in San Francisco in 1990, consisting of just three teams and has 
since grown to include 72 teams from infinity and beyond (but mostly, 
North America and sometimes other continents).  This year, National 
Poetry Slam returns to the Bay Area.Where?This year the National Poetry Slam is in Oakland, California, which is approximately 3080 miles away from Red Bank, New Jersey.When?National Poetry Slam 2014 happens from August 5th through the 9th.Rewards will be sent between August and September.Why?Do
 you love poetry? [""Yes!""] Do you love artistic communities?? [""Yes!""] 
Do you love the people headlining this year's Loser Slam team??? 
[""YES!""] Do you want to see those three things come together in an 
explosion of creativity and general awesomeness?????? [""YES!!!!!!""] 
Well, then you've answered your own internal questions.How?Since
 May, we have been working with our coach MaryCae to hone our craft even
 further, while writing new group poems, while practicing relentlessly, 
while drinking water and eating Nilla Wafers.  We feel ready to 
represent our corner of the country, but we need help from our 
community. As you could imagine, the trip to Oakland is a lotta 
bit expensive.  If you have extra change stuck in the couch cushions, a 
silver dollar that’s actually worth fifty, or some frequent flyer miles 
we could use, we would be incredibly grateful. We some nifty 
prizes to offer our contributors such as TShirts, a team chapbook, audio
 of our poems, one of a kind artwork by local artists, and Linette will 
even dye her hair the color of your choice (sending a video and photos 
of the process).Our expenses are roughly: $3500 for five people 
to flap their wings across the country in an actual aeroplane, $1000 for
 poets to sleep and shower at a hotel, and $500 to register the team to 
compete. You can find LowSir performing at fundraising shows in New Jersey:

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Culture Mill is a 501 ( c )( 3 ) organization based in Saxapahaw, NC. We develop projects that combine artistic and community-based initiatives. We foster collaboration, exchange and new models for creative place-making.</li>
<li>We have a 44-seat blue bird bus; we have readied it to run on biodiesel and we plan to put it to use for both regular public transportation to and from Saxapahaw, and also to facilitate original and dynamic site-specific cultural events. The bus itself was a generous gift from Saxapahaw residents and business owners: Doug Williams and Claire Haslam.</li>
<li>We will begin by commissioning four amazing new site-specific artworks (dances, installations, concerts), and taking audiences to them by bus in the summer of 2015; we will then begin a regular transportation route between Saxapahaw and Carrboro, NC in the fall. We will develop further routes as we build our capacity.</li>
<li>Using the bus for public transportation will not only bring people to and from work, school and existing cultural events in Saxapahaw, but will further our mission to cross-pollinate communities, spreading awareness of various cultural activities in order to grow a population engaged with art and creativity in general.</li>
<li>The bus is not yet named. We took community suggestions for the name of 
the bus at Culture Mill's launch party and our bus team will make a 
decision by the end of April. <br/>

</li> <li>All donations are tax-deductible, and rewards include free passes on the bus, growlers from Haw River Farm House Ales, dinners at the Eddy Restaurant and Pub, gift certificates with Haw River Canoe and Kayak Company, memberships to Saxapahaw Shiftwork Co-working Space, group and private yoga classes, private Argentine Tango Instruction, massages and tickets to a show of your choice at the award-winning Haw River Ballroom!<br/>
</li> <li>If we do not make our goal of $10,000, we will still use contributed funds for the same purposes; we will however, scale back the amount of biodiesel fuel, the scale of art events, the range of initial possible routes, and will rely more heavily on bus fares to get our project going. </li>
<li>If we exceed our goal, funds in excess of $10,000 will simply create more capacity and greater possibilities in both transportation and artistic projects.<br/>

<p><b>Our three tier mod</b><b>el - how participants, youth leaders and coaches benefit:</b><br/></p>
<p>Many of our coaches and youth leaders are from the same communities as our participants. They face a similar uphill climb with regards to poverty, gender and class based discrimination.</p>
<p>Our coaches and youth leaders attend ‘role model training’ sessions before camp begins. This prepares our coaches and youth leaders to facilitate meaningful discussions, teach the technical Ultimate Frisbee curriculum and conduct team building exercises.</p>
<p>Our participants attend pre-camp orientation which tells them what to expect at camp. For many, this will be the first time they have traveled to a different state or been away from their family; pre-camp orientation prepares them for their 5 day adventure. </p>

<p><b>*Why Ultimate Frisbee:</b></p>
<p>For this camp, we have chosen to use Ultimate Frisbee because of how well it lends itself to promote personal development and intercultural exchange.</p>
<p>Ultimate is unique and best suited for Bridging the Gaps because it is: </p>
<ul><li><p><b>Co-ed &amp; non-contact:  </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Boys and girls play together on a team - an aberration to cultural practices within Indian communities where boys and girls rarely mix in sport.</span></p></li></ul>

This facilitates open communication between players and teaches participants how to resolve conflict. It is rare for a sport to allow for this type of player-to-player dialogue.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p><b>Spirit of the Game (SOTG):  </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">SOTG is a heightened version of sportsmanship where competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of respect between players, adherence to the rules, and the basic joy of play.

Our three tier model - how participants, youth leaders and coaches benefit:
Many of our coaches and youth leaders are from the same communities as our participants. They face a similar uphill climb with regards to poverty, gender and class based discrimination.
Our coaches and youth leaders attend ‘role model training’ sessions before camp begins. This prepares our coaches and youth leaders to facilitate meaningful discussions, teach the technical Ultimate Frisbee curriculum and conduct team building exercises.
Our participants attend pre-camp orientation which tells them what to expect at camp. For many, this will be the first time they have traveled to a different state or been away from their family; pre-camp orientation prepares them for their 5 day adventure. 






How you can help: 






Contribute to our Indiegogo campaign and help us to:(a) cover costs of transport/accommodation/meals for participants and coaches(b) provide a stipend for coaches                                                                                       (c) purchase discs, cones, whistles (coaches love 'em!), plain t-shirts (for teens to create their own jerseys!) and art supplies

*Why Ultimate Frisbee:
For this camp, we have chosen to use Ultimate Frisbee because of how well it lends itself to promote personal development and intercultural exchange.
Ultimate is unique and best suited for Bridging the Gaps because it is: 
Co-ed & non-contact:  Boys and girls play together on a team - an aberration to cultural practices within Indian communities where boys and girls rarely mix in sport.
Self refereed:  Contested fouls are settled through discussion between the players involved. This facilitates open communication between players and teaches participants how to resolve conflict. It is rare for a sport to allow for this type of player-to-player dialogue.
Spirit of the Game (SOTG):  SOTG is a heightened version of sportsmanship where competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of respect between players, adherence to the rules, and the basic joy of play. SOTG is built into the rules of the sport.

</div><p><span>“I’m Sorry.”</span></p><br/><p>Those are frequently the words that people say to me when I tell them that I’ve been teaching ninth graders for seventeen years.  As if I were being forced somehow into this profession against my will...dragged into work every day by some maniacal school gnomes or similar creatures.  The fact is, I love my job.  Teaching is not easy and anyone who says so doesn’t know what the heck they’re talking about or is a liar.  There are days when I laugh and there are days when I cry.  The hope is that you don’t break down and cry in the classroom, but I’d be lying if I said that hasn’t happened more than once.  I think that people forget that on top of teaching History (as I do), or Math, or English, or the Arts, or P.E., or World Languages, or Career and Technical Education, or Science, or any other discipline, that we deal with people and that we ourselves are...people.  We are not mindless robots who go in day after day and drill information (although some reformers would like this).  We have emotions and ups and downs like everyone else.  I think it is that humanity, however, which makes a good teacher.  We form connections with our students and colleagues.  I am still friends with some of my teachers from school and I have friendships with several of my former students. </p><br/><p>I started with photography when I was at Bridgewater College in the early to mid 90s.  I travelled across the country with my parents in 1993 and took some photos.  My boyfriend (now husband) said they were good and encouraged me to take more pictures, which I did.  My father gave me his old Minolta XG-7 camera and I took a lot of photos through college, not really knowing what the heck I was doing, but it was a lot of fun.  Then graduation, and marriage, and job, and child, and no time for such hobbies.  Then, in 2008 I joined an online community called Whitechapel, founded by Warren Ellis.  This online community had several threads related to art, including S.P.I.T., the Self Portrait Image Thread, where people checked in each week with a self portrait, updating how they were doing and what was going on in their lives. I received a lot of encouragement from the community and bought a Sony Alpha200 DSLR camera and started...well...taking a metric ton of pictures.  I went out with reckless abandon and just played with my camera, taking pictures of anything and everything.

I started with photography when I was at Bridgewater College in the early to mid 90s.  I travelled across the country with my parents in 1993 and took some photos.  My boyfriend (now husband) said they were good and encouraged me to take more pictures, which I did.  My father gave me his old Minolta XG-7 camera and I took a lot of photos through college, not really knowing what the heck I was doing, but it was a lot of fun.  Then graduation, and marriage, and job, and child, and no time for such hobbies.  Then, in 2008 I joined an online community called Whitechapel, founded by Warren Ellis.  This online community had several threads related to art, including S.P.I.T., the Self Portrait Image Thread, where people checked in each week with a self portrait, updating how they were doing and what was going on in their lives. I received a lot of encouragement from the community and bought a Sony Alpha200 DSLR camera and started...well...taking a metric ton of pictures.  I went out with reckless abandon and just played with my camera, taking pictures of anything and everything. I forced myself to undertake several long-term projects.  I completed two 365 Day self portrait projects as well as one project where I took a picture with a fisheye lens every day for a year.  I found that I enjoyed doing these projects because they forced me to get creative and do a lot of practical problem solving.  The teacher became the student through practice and self-assessment.The past few years, I’ve had moderate success with my photography business, I have had several shows in the area of Harrisonburg, VA as well as art displayed in other galleries in the United States and elsewhere.

and community-inspired artworks is heading toward the finish line in Boulder, Colorado.
With the first round of funding complete, including significant contributions
from Alcoa and MillerCoors, the U.S. Cycling Monument is on target for a July 2014 fundraising deadline.

</p><p>To date, six major donors, in-kind support
from 40 businesses, and the donation of 100 inscribed cobblestones have given the
project great momentum. Now in Phase II the public at large, and all corporate supporters are able through this final campaign to raise the remaining
$150,000 that will enable construction to start.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/684759/files/20140630095259-Road_for_IGG.png?1404147179"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>“Years of prep and approvals with the City,
Parks and Recreation, and Arts Commissions are done,” said monument advisory
board member and design phase consultant Michael Aisner. “We have heard much from people around the world who have been touched in some way by these great races that they too wanted to participate, have their names on cobbles and stones and donate. This last push will be able to assuredly sew
this up by July.”</p>
<p><b>Commemorates the Birthplace of International Pro Cycling in the US</b><br/></p><p>In association with the Boulder Parks and City representative, PLAY Boulder Foundation, designed by Colorado artist Kimmerjae Johnson, the monument will be the focal
point of North Boulder Park, the historic heart of modern U.S. cycling. This is
where, in 1975, entrepreneur Mo Siegel founded the Red Zinger Classic, an
event that morphed into the 16-day Coors International Bicycle Classic, which race promoter Aisner expanded into one of the four biggest stage races in the world.  Covering four states, starting in San Francisco  it garnered CBS/NBC/ESPN coverage, a Warner Bros film and sold $1.5 million in race merchandise in five countries and every year it ended right where the monument will be situated.  It
helped put Boulder
on the map, attracting countless athletes and bike/sports industry businesses, and as America's ""healthiest and thinnest cities,"" helped fulfill Siegel’s dream of a city dedicated to healthy physical
activity through cycling.<br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/685135/files/20140630121448-N_Boulder_Park2.jpg?1404155688"" src="""" style=""""/></p>With a profile changing dynamically as one moves through and around the sculpture, its elegant

and community-inspired artworks is heading toward the finish line in Boulder, Colorado.
With the first round of funding complete, including significant contributions
from Alcoa and MillerCoors, the U.S. Cycling Monument is on target for a July 2014 fundraising deadline.

To date, six major donors, in-kind support
from 40 businesses, and the donation of 100 inscribed cobblestones have given the
project great momentum. Now in Phase II the public at large, and all corporate supporters are able through this final campaign to raise the remaining
$150,000 that will enable construction to start.
“Years of prep and approvals with the City,
Parks and Recreation, and Arts Commissions are done,” said monument advisory
board member and design phase consultant Michael Aisner. “We have heard much from people around the world who have been touched in some way by these great races that they too wanted to participate, have their names on cobbles and stones and donate. This last push will be able to assuredly sew
this up by July.”
Commemorates the Birthplace of International Pro Cycling in the USIn association with the Boulder Parks and City representative, PLAY Boulder Foundation, designed by Colorado artist Kimmerjae Johnson, the monument will be the focal
point of North Boulder Park, the historic heart of modern U.S. cycling. This is
where, in 1975, entrepreneur Mo Siegel founded the Red Zinger Classic, an
event that morphed into the 16-day Coors International Bicycle Classic, which race promoter Aisner expanded into one of the four biggest stage races in the world.  Covering four states, starting in San Francisco  it garnered CBS/NBC/ESPN coverage, a Warner Bros film and sold $1.5 million in race merchandise in five countries and every year it ended right where the monument will be situated.  It
helped put Boulder
on the map, attracting countless athletes and bike/sports industry businesses, and as America's ""healthiest and thinnest cities,"" helped fulfill Siegel’s dream of a city dedicated to healthy physical
activity through cycling.With a profile changing dynamically as one moves through and around the sculpture, its elegant
50-foot-long, spiraling beam of aluminum will convey the excitement of a bike race’s breakaways, chases and
sprints.                                                  (Click here for larger view)Like a silver ribbon, the beam will sail above the cobblestone plaza,
between a canted stone archway ('Winner’s Circle') and a massive standing stone ('Talking Stone'). On this element will be written the
history of the Red Zinger and Coors Classics, commemorating all the winners,
along with their successors in today’s USA Pro Cycling Challenge. On the north border of the plaza, a sweeping arc of substantial buff sandstone block creates a seat wall for visitors to rest and view the monument and the park. Plantings in a raised bed supported by this wall will blow in the wind, like fans waving on the racers.       To complete funding, the project requires more sponsors, along with individual donations for inscribed blocks, cobblestones, and the many ""perks"" listed here.Inscribed 6"" by 12"" tumbled sandstone cobble - for your $100 donation.For more details of the monument, go to www.uscyclingmonument.com FAQ's About this Project (click here)

</div></div>","Our Story

For the 2nd Ghetto Biennale in Port-au-Prince, Haiti,  Jean Elie Gilles, Ebby Louis Angel and I will facilitate an International Folklore Exchange with Haitians and international visitors using folklore to open a dialogue about the current conditions in Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake. The project will consist of gathering stories, mask making, writing and theater workshops, which during the final week of the Biennale in December 2011, will culminate in the choreography of a live multi-media performance. The central theme of the project will be based in the legend of the Loup Garou, a werewolf found in Haitian lore as well as in Native American, Canadian and French culture.



                     

The Impact


 In Haiti, the Loup Garou represents a shape-shifting character that often mirrors the social and political struggles about the countryï¿½s poverty and repression. For the project, we will use the loup-garou legend to initiate a dialogue about the erasure and revision of Haitian identity that has been complicated by colonialism and most recently neo-colonialism. Finally, through the process of storytelling and a multifaceted process, we aim to celebrate Haitian culture and its history of resistance. 


What We Need & What You Get

We would like to raise $3000 to cover our various project expenses including: travel and lodging, stipends for Haitian collaborating artists Jean Elie Gilles and Ebby Louis Angel, digital media equipment, art and costume materials, and workshop expenses such as printing and refreshments for workshop participants. 
We have 5 unique gifts available to those who contribute to our campaign including: limited edition artwork by Ivy Jeanne, Emmalee Conner and Duskin Drum. We also have beautiful original photographs of Haiti and a DVD of work by Jakmel Ekspresyon/ Cine Institute filmmakers Zaka Chery and Ebby Louis Angel which includes two short films and American filmmaker Cary Cronenwett's  video diary of JE's  super eight hand-processing workshop from July 2011.

<p>OUTwordlyFabulous is a spoken word performance show with a message to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">stop bullying</span> and homophobia in our country for youth and adults.  <br/></p>
<br/><p>Award-winning spoken word artist Pandora Scooter wrote and performs the show, directed and produced by To and Fro Production CEO, Cedric Hill.  There are make up artists, wardrobe staff, videography, photography, support staff, stage management, publicity, marketing and a company manager.  You'll hear from some of these people in the video above.  The show is the result of 18 people's work -- all from all

show designed to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">make the world more compassionate and inclusive</span>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The result of all these people's work is a 90 minute, fully produced (lights, sound and projections) powerhouse of a one-woman show about stopping bullying and homophobia which contribute to the ""Culture of Mean"" that children find themselves in every day - both at home and at school.  </p>

<p>On March 10th, we premiered OUTwordlyFabulous to critical success.  Since then we have performed the show in a variety of forms throughout New Jersey and in Los Angeles in preparation for performing across the country.<br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Dr. Paula Rodriguez-Rust, New Jersey's premiere sociologist and 
expert on Anti-Bullying programs, endorsed the show, as did two Licensed
 Clinical Social Workers.  Responses were overwhelmingly positive, 
including comments such as, ""Now I want to go and change my school!"" or 
""Thank you for showing me how much bullying goes on around me.""  or ""I 
never thought about having an all inclusive society, I will think about 
that more.""</p>
<p><br/></p>US Congressman Frank Pallone's also endorsed OUTwordlyFabulous.<br/><br/>OUTworldlyFabulous's message, according to Dr. Rust, is on the cutting edge of current anti-bullying strategies - compassion, inclusion, self-love and self-acceptance are the tools being used to combat the bully culture - and it's working.  Statistics show that more and more children are speaking up about bullying going on in their schools and are becoming less tolerant of it due to messages such as these.<br/><br/>It is this message that OUTwordlyFabulous gets out. <br/>

""Thank you for showing me how much bullying goes on around me.""  or ""I 
never thought about having an all inclusive society, I will think about 
that more.""
US Congressman Frank Pallone's also endorsed OUTwordlyFabulous.OUTworldlyFabulous's message, according to Dr. Rust, is on the cutting edge of current anti-bullying strategies - compassion, inclusion, self-love and self-acceptance are the tools being used to combat the bully culture - and it's working.  Statistics show that more and more children are speaking up about bullying going on in their schools and are becoming less tolerant of it due to messages such as these.It is this message that OUTwordlyFabulous gets out.

<p>Like me, Daguerre was a painter and a photographer.  He was the first French panorama painter. He created theatrical illusions and was celebrated for his set design.

<p><i>Teen Art Salon is a fiscally sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit art service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of Teen Art Salon must be made payable to ""Fractured Atlas"" only, and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.</i><br/></p>
<p><b>1. <u>Who we are/why we're here</u></b></p>
<p>Teen Art Salon began as a forum for adolescent creatives to workshop their ideas and converse with like-minded peers outside of their everyday classroom. </p>
<p>Established as a learning laboratory that prioritizes inquiry, inclusiveness, and self-expression, Teen Art Salon offers salon seminars on contemporary art, issues of social justice, and the politics of youth sub-culture. In addition, we spent the summer hosting a free co-working studio space for adolescent activists, artists, and writers to work on unfinished projects and collaborate on new ones!<br/></p>
<p>On September 18th,  Teen Art Salon's inaugural exhibition ""Juvenilia"" opened at 103 Allen St, featuring over 20 teenage artists from across North America. A preview of works on view can be found here: <a href=""http://www.teenartsalon.com/new-page/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.teenartsalon.com/new-page/</a></p><p>We hope to use this platform to expand our programming schedule and widen participation. We want to do this by providing our NYC students with greater access to materials and equipment to develop their creative projects, and to continue to plan future events in support of young artists nationwide.</p>
<p><b>2. <u>Our Philosophy</u></b><br/>We believe that the extent to which we as a society value arts education, and the way in which arts and humanities are taught to adolescents, needs to be reevaluated. As MIT professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have argued in their recent book, The Second Machine Age, technology has moved on from replacing textile workers and farm hands.  Computers are now diagnosing medical conditions, algorithms are performing audits, and software is doing the work of paralegals.

1. Who we are/why we're here
Teen Art Salon began as a forum for adolescent creatives to workshop their ideas and converse with like-minded peers outside of their everyday classroom. 
Established as a learning laboratory that prioritizes inquiry, inclusiveness, and self-expression, Teen Art Salon offers salon seminars on contemporary art, issues of social justice, and the politics of youth sub-culture. In addition, we spent the summer hosting a free co-working studio space for adolescent activists, artists, and writers to work on unfinished projects and collaborate on new ones!
On September 18th,  Teen Art Salon's inaugural exhibition ""Juvenilia"" opened at 103 Allen St, featuring over 20 teenage artists from across North America. A preview of works on view can be found here: http://www.teenartsalon.com/new-page/We hope to use this platform to expand our programming schedule and widen participation. We want to do this by providing our NYC students with greater access to materials and equipment to develop their creative projects, and to continue to plan future events in support of young artists nationwide.
2. Our PhilosophyWe believe that the extent to which we as a society value arts education, and the way in which arts and humanities are taught to adolescents, needs to be reevaluated. As MIT professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have argued in their recent book, The Second Machine Age, technology has moved on from replacing textile workers and farm hands.  Computers are now diagnosing medical conditions, algorithms are performing audits, and software is doing the work of paralegals. The creative industries are becoming more relevant and accessible than ever, which is why the youth of today should be exploring their creativity and actualizing their imaginations. We provide a space in which adolescents may conduct such research. 
Our open studios are modeled after former art salons throughout history, providing an inclusive, non-hierarchal environment for young artists to collaborate and innovate.

<p>An installation of this size and a transformation of this magnitude - where a 1,000 square foot gallery space becomes a traveling circus tent in every possible way - requires talent and passion, but it also requires resources.</p>
<p>The built environment and reasonable compensation for fire eaters, contortionists, suspensionists, and other circus performers will account for the bulk of the $3,000 production budget.  Much of this is being provided by our host venue, the Apollon Art Space, but your support will help to ensure the highest quality experience is had by artists, performers, and audience members alike.</p>
<p>To say thanks, we've come up with some very fun perks including show tickets, VIP time with the performers, and even free lessons from some of our most talented acts.  Always wanted to learn how fire eating works?  Now's your chance!</p>
<p>While we'd love to meet and surpass our goal, the good news is that, with the Apollon's support, every dollar raised will be available for these core production expenses to make the show bigger and better.   Coming up short is always possible, but, as they say in our business, the show must go on! </p>
<p>Either way, your support makes you part of a broader effort to use art as a vehicle to bring unique experiences to your community.  And let's not forget the value of fun!  We can talk for days about the importance and power of community-supported artwork, but another vital role of art and for artists is to add joy, surprise, excitement, and wonder to our lives.  We take our responsibility to do just that very seriously.  Come to be impacted, but come to have fun with us, too!</p>
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p>$1,250: If we raise $500 beyond our goal, we'll add live circus music to every performance of the show.  Our original production budget allows for recorded music, but we'd love to include an organ grinder, an accordion player, or something equally circus-y if resources allow.</p>
<p>$2,000: If we raise another $750 beyond our first stretch goal, we'll add a full-fledged food truck to the production budget so that carnival snacks won't just stop at popcorn and cotton candy - they'll also include nachos, caramel apples, and FUNNEL CAKE included with your admission.</p>

So I have set my target funding at 3,500 USD - It's a bit higher than the cost of the prints, but I must have to calculate with the rental cost in each places, marketing outgoings, I will need to pay to prints and shipping, pay a percentage of the earnings to the crowdfunding platform (and PayPal), and pay taxes. What will You get for Your contributionOf course my goal is not only collect some cash for the campaign, in return I offer pictures from my gallery which I created over the years, you can find 60 images in this Gallery. They are not only montages, but some landscape and urban photos as well.The images are numbered, and each of them is titled, so based on these the donors can easily choose which picture or pictures they want. In the cases of the $35, $55, $110, $300, $500, and $1000  perks, ones will get the prints on a 300g fine art paper, and all the other perks will be printed by a special UV technology to foam pvc board. This kind of printing is more resistant and spectacular, so these are really perfect as a wall picture. The images with the sign ""Wall READY"" [30x30 cm (11,8x11,8""), 40x40 cm (15,7x15,7""), 50x50 cm (19,6x19,6""), 60x60 cm (23,6x23,6""), 80x80 cm (31,5x31,5""), 100x100 cm (39,3x39,3"")]  are equipped with spacers, so they are totally ready for wall mounting.How can You donate and get your own Print?It is so easy for everyone. You can donate with your typical credit cards (Visa and Mastercard) or with PayPal account. The Perks you get for your contribution are on the right side ( grey framed rectangles). Other ways You can helpI understand that some people are not in a position to make any kind of monetary contribution, so if you can’t contribute, that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

</div><h3><span>Our Story:</span></h3><h3>Resident Arts Emerging Artist Residency</h3><p>Resident Arts' mission is to provide professional development opportunities for artists at every level of their career to cultivate the arts locally and broaden the horizons of local artists, nationally. Our programs train young, emerging, and professional artists as well as supporters of the arts to embrace experimentation and critical thinking to lay a foundation for sustainable creative practice in the region.</p><p>Sarah Goodnow Riley-Land is the first resident in our Emerging Artist Residency program. Unlike traditional residency programs, local emerging artists inhabit the studio on a part-time basis. They undergo career coaching and attend the professional development workshop series to bolster their arts career, learning about marketing, grant writing, concept development, and more. The resident artist works to create a large-scale work that is beyond the scope of their existing practice. The artist then presents the final work to the public.</p><p>Resident Arts' director works along the resident throughout the course of the three months to help realize their artistic vision for the work, while at the same time acting as a support system for time management, funding, and promotion of the work.

There are several web templates for online stores (like the one that hosts our shop) so we thought ""heck, there must be one that could hand a registry"". But we were wrong. </div>
<div>When we started to research options, it quickly became apparent that what is out there simply won't work for what we need to create. We need a site where couples can log-in and create their own gift registry, and then send their unique, personal gallery URL to their wedding guests. This is far more complex than any e-commerce platform that currently exists on the web. We want our site to be easy to use, secure, and as unique as the products we are promoting.

</div>
</div><div> <p>The vision for Gather is simple, create a new economy for art, with a mission to represent and compensate artists fairly for their work and educate consumers to convert them from one-time buyers into collectors.</p>
<p>We seek to create a market for art where artists are paid fairly for the value of their work. Artists work hard, and Gather wants them to be compensated for the hours of labor, creativity and expertise that goes into a single object. Through Gather, we have the opportunity to make connections between artists and buyers, providing education and insight into the artistic process and the business of being an artist. </p>
<p>Think of a matchmaker - someone who brings two people together with the idea of creating a relationship. We want to bring buyers to artists and artists to buyers to create a relationship that lasts beyond a wedding day. One of the great things about being an art collector is getting to know an artist, learning about their process, following their career, learning how they share their creativity and passion through a tangible piece of work. One of the great things about being an artist is sharing your work and passion with others and learning how they see what you've created. Together artists and collectors get to share in the excitement and beauty of a created object. Gather will turn art lovers into collectors, and match them with the makers. </p>

The Bride. The Artist. The Gift Giver.
We’re the team, and best friends, behind Gather. Hilary was a bride last year, wishing she could register for hand made ceramic dishes instead of standard china from a big box store. Anna is a ceramic artist with a passion for bringing art out of the museum and into peoples homes. Rachel has been a wedding guest more times than she can count and found herself wanting a more creative alternative to the towels and toasters that fill traditional gift registries.
Over the years we've found ourselves thinking - why isn't there a gift registry that specializes in art?
So we created Gather, an online retail shop featuring a curated collection of pieces by local artists as the first step toward realizing our dream of an art gift registry.    
Our Goal: Gather Couples, Artists and Guests Together Online
With our shop we promote local artists and sell their work. Our next goal is to be the matchmakers between couples seeking unique and local items for their registries, and artists seeking a new market. Here's how it will work:
Step 1: Engaged couples will be able to build a personal registry page with items they pick from our permanent gallery, and will also be able to suggest new artists to include on their individual registry. 
Step 2: Their wedding (and shower and engagement party) guests will view the couple's personal registry, purchase gifts, or make contributions to larger-ticket items. 
Step 3: The Gather website handles all the logistics needed to make purchases happen smoothly.
Step 4: Gifts are delivered, couples are thrilled with new art that fills their home and guests feel satisfied knowing that they gave a truly unique and wanted gift. 
Step 5: Is it too much to hope for that this will result in more homes filled with local art, more people engaging with Minnesota artists, and more couples gathering art well beyond their wedding day, creating a new economy for artists? We don't think so. 


Help Build the Registry

When we started this endeavor we thought we would be able to easily build an online retail site using an existing e-commerce site. There are several web templates for online stores (like the one that hosts our shop) so we thought ""heck, there must be one that could hand a registry"". But we were wrong. 
When we started to research options, it quickly became apparent that what is out there simply won't work for what we need to create. We need a site where couples can log-in and create their own gift registry, and then send their unique, personal gallery URL to their wedding guests. This is far more complex than any e-commerce platform that currently exists on the web. We want our site to be easy to use, secure, and as unique as the products we are promoting. This will require a complex database to support all the registry and e-commerce functions. So we need a programmer to build it from scratch. 
This is why we need you. We are raising funds to pay a programmer to build the registry website with these essential functions:

a gallery of art pieces that show the site's permanent collections
 a customer log-in and the ability to build a personalized registry
secure retail transactions

Our goal of $18,000 is based on research, multiple technology bids and many conversations about how to best provide services to artists and customers alike. This is why we are asking you, friends, family, artists and art supporters, to help make this dream of creating a new economy for art, a reality.  


Connecting Artists and a New Generation of Collectors: The Long-term Vision

 The vision for Gather is simple, create a new economy for art, with a mission to represent and compensate artists fairly for their work and educate consumers to convert them from one-time buyers into collectors.
We seek to create a market for art where artists are paid fairly for the value of their work. Artists work hard, and Gather wants them to be compensated for the hours of labor, creativity and expertise that goes into a single object. Through Gather, we have the opportunity to make connections between artists and buyers, providing education and insight into the artistic process and the business of being an artist. 
Think of a matchmaker - someone who brings two people together with the idea of creating a relationship. We want to bring buyers to artists and artists to buyers to create a relationship that lasts beyond a wedding day. One of the great things about being an art collector is getting to know an artist, learning about their process, following their career, learning how they share their creativity and passion through a tangible piece of work. One of the great things about being an artist is sharing your work and passion with others and learning how they see what you've created. Together artists and collectors get to share in the excitement and beauty of a created object. Gather will turn art lovers into collectors, and match them with the makers. 


I Loved the Art I Saw in the Video, Who Made It?

Check out our image gallery to see the images from the video and find the artists who made them. You can also shop for items by all of these artists at our preview shop: www.gatherartregistry.com


How Else Can I Get Involved? Thank you so much for considering our campaign. We hope you love this idea as much as we do. While this campaign is focused on raising funds for creating this website, there are other ways to get involved with Gather. 

Shop at our preview shop! See a sampling of items from our permanent collection artists. There's something for everyone at every price point. (www.gatherartregistry.com)


Share this with your friends! We already have some connections to the local art community. But we want more people to know about Gather. Share this with artists who want to create a new economy for art. Share it with your friends who are getting married soon and are setting up their gift registries. Share it with anyone who's ever bought a wedding present! 
Getting married soon? We would love to include you as one of the first couples to use the new Gather website. And you’ll be in good company, Anna will be using it for her wedding registry next summer!
 
Let’s talk! We’ve been amazed at the energy that has grown around this idea. And some of our best ideas have come from our friends and the artists you see in this campaign. If this is inspiring you or you have your own ideas about Gather, let’s go out for a coffee or a beer and talk about it! Shoot us an e-mail and we’ll set up a time to chat.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Francine Levine. There aren't many spots in my home that aren't stuffed with various natural materials in different stages of decay. It's not that I don't keep a neat home. Where one might see fodder for the compost heap, I see art. I am a papermaking artist. These found materials that I bring home are in the process to become works of art.</p>
<p>I always noticed beautiful objects in nature and brought some home to comtemplate, decorate and for my cat to investigate. But then looking for a diversion from advocating for inner city infants and toddlers and operating a book business, I started taking papermaking classes at the Birmingham Bloomfield Art Center. I quickly mastered the techniques under the guidance of Anne Storm Van Leeuwen, an accomplished paper artist.</p>
<p>I am proud of how far I have taken myself in this endeaver. My work has been shown at the Birmingham Bloomfield Art Center, at Haifa's Bet Chagall Museum, in Jerusalem and in Beersheva. I am eager to progress further in the field</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>I am passionate about papermaking and wish to advance my skills by attending the Watermarks 2012 conference in Cleveland, Ohio. Held at the Morgan Art of Papermaking Conservatory, members of Dard Hunter and IAMPA with join together for five days of workshops, lectures, exhibits and museum tours. A preconference entitled Eco-Print Plant Color for Paper is being offered by India Flint. This is a perfect way for me to advance my skills and take them to the next level.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To attend the five day conference and preconference I will need $1400. This will cover my transportation to and from Cleveland, 5 nights accommodations and the conference fee of $250. To attend the preconference I will need an additional $225. I am hoping that many small gifts will add up to create a big impact. Everyone who contributes will receive a personal handmade note and the other perks as listed. If not all the funds are raised, hopefully it will lower my costs to attend and progress further with my papermaking.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
I appreciate any assistance you can give. No contribution is too small. If you are unable to help at this time, maybe you know someone who can. Share this page with them. Email it. Post it on your Facebook page, Twitter, or Blog.</div>

This particular use of node-link graphics will give us a view on the inconceivable, pushing our understanding of drawing as a thinking tool to an extreme.

It thus interrogates the advantages of technical graphics by directly engaging with things that <em>cannot</em> be made easier to understand through them. Is there a space that disallows the mapping of logical relations by node-link graphics? Is connectivity always a knowable state? What are the upper limits of the denotational logic of such diagrams?

<p>Website development will be key in our endeavor. We have sought the advice of some of the top developers in NYC on this project - but implementation of social interactions is always challenging. We will continue to look for and work with the best talent in NYC to make this website a reality.</p>
<p>Candle production: We've prototyped and tested the candles with the highest quality materials available. But this product is handmade and mass-production will be complicated and slow, we look forward to the challenge and are confident that we will reach out goal date of April 4th. If there is a delay in production we will let you know as soon as possible.</p>Our initial goal of $7500 is to place a minimum order for 2500 candles.<br/>Our secondary goal of $15,000 will address more technical aspects of the website.  With challenges in social interaction we hope <p></p>

</div></div>","Our Indiegogo campaign was a total success!  We are now going into full production, if you would like you can still participate by visiting us at: http://thislightshines.com""This Light Shines"" is a digital exhibition to honor those we've loved and lost.  To remember those we light candles: at churches, on lakes, and some send lanterns into the heavens. The goal of this project is to continue that tradition on-line, and light up 1,500 candles on an interactive map, and around the world. 

We lost a dear friend in 2012. Adi (ah-dee) sold candles on Etsy, but when he fell sick the business went to the wayside. We retrieved the remaining supplies from his family and began to develop a new candle in his honor, centered around the Buddhist belief of rebirth. The essence of the Buddhist belief in rebirth is that our energy is carried  forward. We are considered to be an endless energy passing from one to the next, much like the flame of a candle lighting another. The flame transfers, but the new flame carries its own identity.




When you support our Indiegogo campaign, you’ll receive a hand-made, numbered candle as a gift, which you’ll be able to register on http://thislightshines.com. From there, you’ll be able to dedicate the light to the memory of someone you’ve loved.



We will pin-point the flame on an interactive map. Using the hashtag #shines4 will cause your flame to blossom into a Lotus Flower for eight hours. Each time you think of your loved one, you can tweet the map to keep their blossom full.


A portion of the proceeds will go to benefit a health campaign for those in need of assistance. If this project is successful, we hope to develop other candles for more causes.

This interactive art project is one of the many ways that we carry Adi’s energy forward..  All candles will be shipped before April 2014.  We are asking everyone to light their devoted candle for the first night on April 4th, so we can share in a communal showing of love for all those whom have passed… and light up the world.

OUR CHALLENGES:
Website development will be key in our endeavor. We have sought the advice of some of the top developers in NYC on this project - but implementation of social interactions is always challenging. We will continue to look for and work with the best talent in NYC to make this website a reality.
Candle production: We've prototyped and tested the candles with the highest quality materials available. But this product is handmade and mass-production will be complicated and slow, we look forward to the challenge and are confident that we will reach out goal date of April 4th. If there is a delay in production we will let you know as soon as possible.Our initial goal of $7500 is to place a minimum order for 2500 candles.Our secondary goal of $15,000 will address more technical aspects of the website.  With challenges in social interaction we hope 
We are excited for you to join us on our journey! LET'S LIGHT IT UP!

<p>     Hello, and thank you for visiting our page! We are a group of passionate educators who are on a mission to bring an after school art program to our school! We teach at Voices College Bound Language Academy, which is a high performing dual immersion school located in San Jose, California. Voices is a developing charter school currently in its 7th year. And although our students are excelling academically, the majority of our student population is low-income, which means access to the arts out of school is fairly limited. We all know how crucial the arts are to our student's development of creativity, confidence, and innovation, which is why we want to bring Art to Voices!<br/>    Due to nation wide budget cuts, limited funding for the arts is available. With your contribution, we would get the support we need to build a completely new art program from the bottom up. This means purchasing art materials such as paint brushes, assorted types of paint, card stock, canvas, drawing pencils, charcoal, etc. We would also be using your contribution to take our students on a field trip to an art museum here in San Jose! Classes will be given to our students once a week for one and half hours. Each month focussing in on a new form of media and artist. For example, one of the first projects we have planned is teaching students printmaking using Andy Warhol as a model. Specifically for this project we would need, individual canvases, card stock, ink, and rollers. Each monthly project is budgeted anywhere from 200-250 dollars for roughly 35-40 students, making our total goal to raise $2,200 dollars. Should you choose to contribute to our project, we would love to keep you on our mailing list to send you e-mail updates of the wonderful projects we are confident our students will be producing! <br/>    Every great thing begins with an idea. But most times, it's the support we receive from our friends, family, and even strangers who believe in the idea that help make it a reality. We are asking for your partnership in making this idea a reality! By bringing art classes to our students we are gifting them with an opportunity that will prosper more than just great art to look at, but a wider knowledge of the arts, and a planted seed of creativity that will continue to bare fruit for the rest of their lives! Creativity that is essential for the real world that follows.<br/>    Please take a moment to share our page with your friends, family, neighbors etc.! Get the word out, so we can make this very idea a reality for our students! Lets bring Art to Voices! </p>

<h3><strong>About this Poem-Print Intervention<br/></strong></h3>
<p>On May 2, The FBI announced it was adding Assata Shakur to its ""Most Wanted Terrorists"" list, adding another $1 million reward to the $1 million bounty already offered by New Jersey.</p>
<p>In response, I penned this poem for Assata, in call and response with her poem, <a href=""http://www.assatashakur.org/poem2.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I believe in living,""</a> and with <a href=""http://collectiveliberation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/For_Assata_Lorde.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Audre Lorde's poem ""For Assata""</a> (from which my poem's title is borrowed), Lorde's always homing essay, <a href=""http://www.onbeing.org/program/words-shimmer/feature/poetry-not-luxury-audre-lorde/318"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Poetry is not a Luxury,""</a> <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=Rq4ULhcfkVkC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=wearing+my+cap+backwards+cheryl+clarke&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RsD2pSjlgi&amp;sig=WJamP9qae6AlQPZuIwL2DfMsNPM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G3maUcWVGpHe8wSe84DADQ&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wearing%20my%20cap%20backwards%20cheryl%20clarke&amp;f=false"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cheryl Clarke's poem ""wearing my cap backwards""</a> (in which she writes, ""poets are among the first witches""), and <a href=""http://www.sfweekly.com/2013-01-16/culture/the-witch-house-theater-review/full/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Morgan Bassichis' play ""The Witch House""</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by a tree I happened upon over a rainy, thunderous Atlanta weekend, carried by the words and spirit of Assata, Audre, Cheryl, and Morgan, I visioned a two-tone relief print integrating image and text. I carved two linoloeum blocks, tested colors, and made artist proofs for the print I'd love to share with you and yours as we amplify our liberation love frequency in the midst of the state's witch hunt and ever growing climate of terror -- I heard that there are Assata wanted signs all along the New Jersey Turnpike now.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>To start my business, I will need $10,000 CAD, broken up as follows:</div>

<li>First month's lease     ..................................................................    $1396.00</li>
<li>Technology (computer, 4-in-1 printer, phone, projector)  ...........       1150.00</li>
<li>Furniture &amp; fixtures (chairs, tables, whiteboards, organizers) ...         950.00</li>

Contributors will also receive one-of-a-kind art products that I make, such as bookmarks, artist trading cards, postcards, greeting cards, prints and original paintings from my collection!</div>
<div>Even if I don't meet my goal here, all funds will be put to good use to obtain the most basic necessities, starting with my lease--without which I won't even be able to operate. The other basic necessities include furniture, art supplies, art tools, and lots of paper for writing and printing. </div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I came to Canada, I settled on PEI because of the rich cultural community that exists here. I was a little saddened to find out that about 40% of Islanders are illiterate, that there are no strong art programs that run the whole year round, and that so many students and workers do not have the writing and speaking skills they need to do research, reports, or presentations. Writing and speaking skills are extremely important when you are out in the real world, while art is food for the soul and helps make the world a better place. I felt a huge need for this and now that I have been given this chance to teach these skills, I really want it to succeed. All these will help make PEI and, by extension, Canada, a much better place for cultural diversity and professionalism.</p>
<p>Before I came to Canada, I traveled all over the Philippines delivering training workshops to professionals in various industries, especially in education, on Effective Communication, among a multitude of other topics. I prepared countless programs in English for specific purposes, tailored to whatever the industry required. I was also an Assistant Professor in the tertiary level as well as the Executive Director of Benildanze, a college dance company that gave dance scholarships to deserving students. I produced and co-directed 5 successful major performances and 1 summer performance tour, managing the fund-raising, marketing, and other technicalities. </p>
<p>I have always believed in doing my best and helping others, and I know that I have been contributing to create a better world by using my talents in art, speaking and writing as a teacher. If PEI cannot provide this service to Islanders, I know that I can. My biggest hope is that I will instill a love for art and writing, and a desire to develop excellent communication skills in my students, because <b>IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO LEARN!</b> </p>
<p>I will always devote myself to teaching <i><b>passionate, personalized, progressive, professional programs all year round through creative communication and expression</b></i> and <b><i><a href=""www.artnwords.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Art 'n' Words Studio &amp; Gallery</a></i></b> is the best way I can do it. </p>

<p>Even if you can't spare a bit of cash now, contributions in kind are also welcome and you can send them to 155 Queen Street, Lower Level, Charlottetown, PE C1A 4B4 Canada. </p>
<p>Another really big way you can help me is to let others know how they can help me through this link:</p>

The Impact
When I came to Canada, I settled on PEI because of the rich cultural community that exists here. I was a little saddened to find out that about 40% of Islanders are illiterate, that there are no strong art programs that run the whole year round, and that so many students and workers do not have the writing and speaking skills they need to do research, reports, or presentations. Writing and speaking skills are extremely important when you are out in the real world, while art is food for the soul and helps make the world a better place. I felt a huge need for this and now that I have been given this chance to teach these skills, I really want it to succeed. All these will help make PEI and, by extension, Canada, a much better place for cultural diversity and professionalism.
Before I came to Canada, I traveled all over the Philippines delivering training workshops to professionals in various industries, especially in education, on Effective Communication, among a multitude of other topics. I prepared countless programs in English for specific purposes, tailored to whatever the industry required. I was also an Assistant Professor in the tertiary level as well as the Executive Director of Benildanze, a college dance company that gave dance scholarships to deserving students. I produced and co-directed 5 successful major performances and 1 summer performance tour, managing the fund-raising, marketing, and other technicalities. 
I have always believed in doing my best and helping others, and I know that I have been contributing to create a better world by using my talents in art, speaking and writing as a teacher. If PEI cannot provide this service to Islanders, I know that I can. My biggest hope is that I will instill a love for art and writing, and a desire to develop excellent communication skills in my students, because IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO LEARN! 
I will always devote myself to teaching passionate, personalized, progressive, professional programs all year round through creative communication and expression and Art 'n' Words Studio & Gallery is the best way I can do it.

Center at Ryerson Woods</b></p>
<p><i>Nurturing
art, nature and discovery</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>Help
us explore the relationship between people and nature through art by
supporting quality art exhibitions offered in a stunning setting—Brushwood Center at Ryerson Woods.</p>
<p>Aligning
art and nature is key to our mission, and Brushwood Center does it well. Here
visitors find diverse ways to discover nature in every season—be it through
creative programs offered within the historic and intimate Brushwood Center
home or the surrounding vast and beautiful woodlands.</p>
<p>We
seek support for our gallery exhibitions—showcasing painting, photography,
sculpture, video, performance art, spoken word, music, fiber arts and more.<span>  These provide the visitor an opportunity to contemplate
the natural world through the expression of emerging and established
artists. </span></p>
<p>Our
goal is to lead each visitor on a personal journey of discovery while deepening
their environmental ethic.</p>
<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>Brushwood
Center at Ryerson Woods is a non-profit that connects people with nature. We
seek to build an environmental ethic through innovative public programs
presented against a backdrop of stately woods where pre-settlement flora and
fauna still flourish.</p>
<p>Brushwood
Center invites a diverse community of voices to engage in the discourse around
art, culture, the environment, as well as the relationship between those
concepts. </p>
<p><b>Ryerson Woods</b></p>
<p>Brushwood
Center is located in the heart of Ryerson Woods, a property of the Lake County
Forest Preserves. Ryerson Woods is one of the most ecologically significant
preserves in Illinois.<span>  Serving as a
living classroom, Ryerson Woods is an oasis of 561 acres of magnificent
woodlands.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What We Do</b></p>
<p>“Art,”
according to the French post-impressionist painter Pierre Bonnard, would “never
be able to exist without nature.” Since 1984,Brushwood Center has drawn people into nature with innovative
programs that feature art, music, film and literature, often at little or no
cost to the public. Offered out of an elegant and historic Classical Revival
home (the Ryerson family’s former summer home) with a columned portico, Brushwood
Center’s programs are unique in the region and offer the community a myriad of
ways to discover the magic of nature.</p>
<p><b>We Need You</b></p>
<p>We need </p>
<p>Brushwood
Center relies on the generosity of the public to support its work.<span>  This crowdfunding campaign will raise vital
funds for Brushwood Center’s art exhibition program.  With your donation and help in spreading the
word about this campaign, we cultivate a community that understands the
importance of Brushwood Center’s mission.</span></p>
<p><u>Current show</u>:</p>
<p><i>Views from Brushwood Farm</i></p>
<p><i>Photographs by Edward L.
Ryerson and Edward Ranney, 1937</i>–<i>1974</i></p>
<p>As a
special celebration for Brushwood Center’s 30 years, this exhibition reflects
back on the visionary family that guaranteed the protection of this special
place.<span>  The show combines photographs
made by Edward L. Ryerson of activities of his family and friends at Brushwood
Farm with pictures of the house and woods made by his grandson, professional
photographer Edward Ranney, before the property was transferred to the Lake
County Forest Preserves in 1971.  Mr. Ryerson's pictures are reprinted from
the extensive photographic archive he compiled between 1937–1971, and the
pictures of the house, as furnished by the Ryersons, are from the collection
made by their grandson Edward Ranney between 1972–1974. The majority of
photographs presented are black and white, augmented by color pictures made by
Mr. Ryerson after the late 1950s. </span>Exhibition runs September 7 through
October 30, 2014.</p>
<p><i><u>Upcoming show</u>:</i></p><p><i>Hidden
/ Protected:  Paintings by Nina Weiss</i></p>
<p>This series of landscape
oil paintings by artist Nina Weiss depict nature with colors intense, lush and
dramatic.  Her work travels beyond traditional ideas of a green landscape,
as she teases out the complex colors of nature, creating layers of contrast, line
and form.  Through her paintings, she celebrates hidden natural landscapes
that are often ignored or overlooked in urban environments.  Her work
provides the viewer with a contemporary look at the traditional genre of
landscape. Exhibition
runs November 9 through December 23, 2014.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/840626/files/20140907120302-artexhibit.JPG?1410116582"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><u>Recent
exhibitions include</u>: </p>
<p><i>Avian Spirits</i></p>
<p>For centuries, artists have been attracted to—and inspired by—the
ephemeral qualities of birds. Soaring above the Earth, birds have long
symbolized freedom and aspiration. Including the work of 14 artists, this group
exhibition presents birds as metaphors for the human spirit.<span>  Curated by Franck Mercurio.  July 13 through August 31, 2014.</span></p>
<p><i>Moving Targets</i></p>
<p>The year 2014 marks the centenary of the extinction of the
passenger pigeon, once the most abundant bird in North America that was
hunted to extinction within a period of 40 years. <i>Moving Targets, </i>a collaborative art installation by Ann
Rosenthal and Steffi Domike, links the artists’ forced family migrations to the
story of the passenger pigeon through a shared visual language, maps, and
creative research. In addition to exhibiting their own work, the artists
invited 14 artists to each represent a state within the former pigeon
nesting range, to create a passenger pigeon “portrait gallery.” May/June 2014</p>
<p>If you have visited Ryerson Woods or the galleries of Brushwood Center,
you know that it is run by a small group of dedicated staff and
volunteers.<span>  But like any other museum
or educational institution, dedication alone is not enough to make it
work—money is needed to pay for the staff members who conceive and organize the
events, the curators who assemble exhibitions, the supplies required to
professionally hang exhibitions and the talented artists who often travel to us
from far beyond Illinois.  Many costs are
associated with art exhibitions. Because Brushwood Center does not pass the
cost of art exhibitions to the individuals and families who attend our events,
we rely on the generous donations of people like you who believe in the
importance of our mission.  </span></p>
<p>Brushwood Center at Ryerson Woods is grateful for your donation
of any amount and offers a variety of perks to those who contribute, from tote
bags to limited edition artwork by talented regional artists.<span>  Please make sure to review the list of these
perks before deciding on the amount of your donation . . . </span></p>

Center at Ryerson Woods
Nurturing
art, nature and discovery

Help
us explore the relationship between people and nature through art by
supporting quality art exhibitions offered in a stunning setting—Brushwood Center at Ryerson Woods.
Aligning
art and nature is key to our mission, and Brushwood Center does it well. Here
visitors find diverse ways to discover nature in every season—be it through
creative programs offered within the historic and intimate Brushwood Center
home or the surrounding vast and beautiful woodlands.
We
seek support for our gallery exhibitions—showcasing painting, photography,
sculpture, video, performance art, spoken word, music, fiber arts and more.  These provide the visitor an opportunity to contemplate
the natural world through the expression of emerging and established
artists. 
Our
goal is to lead each visitor on a personal journey of discovery while deepening
their environmental ethic.
Who We Are
Brushwood
Center at Ryerson Woods is a non-profit that connects people with nature. We
seek to build an environmental ethic through innovative public programs
presented against a backdrop of stately woods where pre-settlement flora and
fauna still flourish.
Brushwood
Center invites a diverse community of voices to engage in the discourse around
art, culture, the environment, as well as the relationship between those
concepts. 
Ryerson Woods
Brushwood
Center is located in the heart of Ryerson Woods, a property of the Lake County
Forest Preserves. Ryerson Woods is one of the most ecologically significant
preserves in Illinois.  Serving as a
living classroom, Ryerson Woods is an oasis of 561 acres of magnificent
woodlands.

What We Do
“Art,”
according to the French post-impressionist painter Pierre Bonnard, would “never
be able to exist without nature.” Since 1984,Brushwood Center has drawn people into nature with innovative
programs that feature art, music, film and literature, often at little or no
cost to the public. Offered out of an elegant and historic Classical Revival
home (the Ryerson family’s former summer home) with a columned portico, Brushwood
Center’s programs are unique in the region and offer the community a myriad of
ways to discover the magic of nature.
We Need You
We need 
Brushwood
Center relies on the generosity of the public to support its work.  This crowdfunding campaign will raise vital
funds for Brushwood Center’s art exhibition program.  With your donation and help in spreading the
word about this campaign, we cultivate a community that understands the
importance of Brushwood Center’s mission.
Current show:
Views from Brushwood Farm
Photographs by Edward L.
Ryerson and Edward Ranney, 1937–1974
As a
special celebration for Brushwood Center’s 30 years, this exhibition reflects
back on the visionary family that guaranteed the protection of this special
place.  The show combines photographs
made by Edward L. Ryerson of activities of his family and friends at Brushwood
Farm with pictures of the house and woods made by his grandson, professional
photographer Edward Ranney, before the property was transferred to the Lake
County Forest Preserves in 1971.  Mr. Ryerson's pictures are reprinted from
the extensive photographic archive he compiled between 1937–1971, and the
pictures of the house, as furnished by the Ryersons, are from the collection
made by their grandson Edward Ranney between 1972–1974. The majority of
photographs presented are black and white, augmented by color pictures made by
Mr. Ryerson after the late 1950s. Exhibition runs September 7 through
October 30, 2014.
Upcoming show:Hidden
/ Protected:  Paintings by Nina Weiss
This series of landscape
oil paintings by artist Nina Weiss depict nature with colors intense, lush and
dramatic.  Her work travels beyond traditional ideas of a green landscape,
as she teases out the complex colors of nature, creating layers of contrast, line
and form.  Through her paintings, she celebrates hidden natural landscapes
that are often ignored or overlooked in urban environments.  Her work
provides the viewer with a contemporary look at the traditional genre of
landscape. Exhibition
runs November 9 through December 23, 2014.
Recent
exhibitions include: 
Avian Spirits
For centuries, artists have been attracted to—and inspired by—the
ephemeral qualities of birds. Soaring above the Earth, birds have long
symbolized freedom and aspiration. Including the work of 14 artists, this group
exhibition presents birds as metaphors for the human spirit.  Curated by Franck Mercurio.  July 13 through August 31, 2014.
Moving Targets
The year 2014 marks the centenary of the extinction of the
passenger pigeon, once the most abundant bird in North America that was
hunted to extinction within a period of 40 years. Moving Targets, a collaborative art installation by Ann
Rosenthal and Steffi Domike, links the artists’ forced family migrations to the
story of the passenger pigeon through a shared visual language, maps, and
creative research. In addition to exhibiting their own work, the artists
invited 14 artists to each represent a state within the former pigeon
nesting range, to create a passenger pigeon “portrait gallery.” May/June 2014
If you have visited Ryerson Woods or the galleries of Brushwood Center,
you know that it is run by a small group of dedicated staff and
volunteers.  But like any other museum
or educational institution, dedication alone is not enough to make it
work—money is needed to pay for the staff members who conceive and organize the
events, the curators who assemble exhibitions, the supplies required to
professionally hang exhibitions and the talented artists who often travel to us
from far beyond Illinois.  Many costs are
associated with art exhibitions. Because Brushwood Center does not pass the
cost of art exhibitions to the individuals and families who attend our events,
we rely on the generous donations of people like you who believe in the
importance of our mission.  
Brushwood Center at Ryerson Woods is grateful for your donation
of any amount and offers a variety of perks to those who contribute, from tote
bags to limited edition artwork by talented regional artists.  Please make sure to review the list of these
perks before deciding on the amount of your donation . . . 

The Perks

At
$25, you’ll receive a packet of milkweed seeds. 
The population of the emblematic monarch butterfly is diminishing. By
spreading native milkweed seeds (which is the monarch’s sole food source) in
your backyard garden, you provide the monarchs with vital habitat and food.
For
$50, we offer you the opportunity to give the gift of a family membership to
Brushwood Center.  Members receive
discounts on programs, receive our newsletter, the Ryerson Almanac, and will be recognized for the gift in the fall
issue of our newsletter.

With
a gift of $100, you’ll receive a photograph by professional nature photographer
Carol Freeman.  Freeman is the founder of
the Endangered Species Photography Project, and her photos have appeared in
well-known journals like National
Geographic and Nikon World.  After your donation is made, we will contact
you with your three photograph options.

At
$250, you’ll receive a tote bag featuring Brushwood Center’s attractive logo
which can be used to haul groceries or carry books.


We
offer a limited-edition medallion to those who donate $500.  Designed by Glenn and Deborah Doering of
DOEprojekts, the medallion is based on the Doering’s outdoor installation Code for Avian Navigation that appears
as part of the Avian Spirits exhibition.  The medallion is engraved with the stylized
images that reflect homing mechanisms used by migratory birds.  The Doering’s work has been exhibited and
performed at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and the Art Institute of
Chicago.

For
$1000, Brushwood Center offers a remarkable sculpture of a passenger pigeon
designed and fabricated by artists Sarah Belknap and Joseph Belknap.  The Belknap’s work has been displayed in
prominent museums and galleries throughout the country, including the Museum of
Contemporary Art Chicago and are instructors at The School of the Art Institute
of Chicago.
Finally,
for $2,500, you and up to seven guests will be given a private tour of Brushwood
Center and its exhibits by Nick Bothfeld, chair of Brushwood Center’s Board of
Directors.  On the tour, Nick will
discuss the history of the Ryerson estate, the historic building and the artwork

<p>Two-Tone Art Gallery opened on April 10, 2013. It is the brain child of Todd Wilson, a tattoo artist in Murfreesboro, TN. An avid painter, Todd wanted a space to not only create and showcase his own art but to allow other local artists to create and showcase art of all styles and media. The past two years have been a whirlwind of growth and learning experiences for us. <br/></p>

</p>
<h3>Two-Tone's Future</h3>
<p>Todd plans on opening his own tattoo shop in the rooms behind the art gallery early next year. We are excited at the thought of this new endeavor bringing more traffic into the gallery, and want to make sure it's prepared for the influx. As interest grows, we want to be able to improve our business to best fit the art needs of our community. <i><b>Note:</b> None of the money raised in this campaign will fund supplies for the tattoo shop - it is all going toward updating the gallery.</i></p>

</div><p>Background:</p><p>In fall 2013, Artist Dawn Marie Marchand was approached by a
community member who knew that the final Truth and Reconciliation Commission
event was going to Edmonton March 2014. Knowing the power of Walking With Our
Sisters Exhibit which provided immense awareness to the issue of Murdered and
Missing Indigenous women, it also gave people a voice to be heard and often
much needed healing. She wondered if such a project could happen for
Residential School Survivors and their intergenerational descendants who are
still affected even if they did not attend themselves. This project was born
from that original conversation.  A
public announcement for paper bricks was made, that would be visual
representations of stories from Indian Residential School or how it affected
them or their descendants. Art builds were held around Alberta which included
Edmonton, Calgary, St. Paul and others. Many more bricks were mailed from
across Canada. Notably Winnipeg held art builds where over 56 participants
contributed bricks to the art installation. These were collaged onto the canvas
walls of a gazebo to create a one room school house. Each brick represented a
story that for some were the first steps towards healing. The bricks were treated
in a way that honours each story and participant. They were all smudged and
wrapped in prints while they were being compiled. When they were being
installed they were smudged again and not allowed to touch the floor.  At the viewing, people were asked to hold a
stone in their left hand and leave it with use when they left. These stones
will be laid into the walking paths of theHealing Garden at Blue Quills First
Nation College. It is a symbolic representation of placing the hurts under our
feet.  The installation was well received
with 1000’s of people attending. The feedback was incredibly positive and
received good publicity as it was then moved to CBC Radio at Edmonton Place
after the TRC event. It was then requested to be viewed again in Edmonton at
the International Works Festival where it was one of the <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">feature exhibits in the Big Tent with Ken Armstrong’s
powerful photography on Homelessness in Edmonton. It was the most visited
exhibit averaging over 1,200 people daily. There was a great deal of dialogue
created with this predominantly mainstream non-native event.</span></p>

artists. </p>
<p>In January of this year, The Bricklayers traveled from Chicago
to Minneapolis to share their unique training with our artists.

immersed our artists into their highly regarded and technical neutral mask
method, strengthening our theater ensemble and challenging our artists to find
a greater autonomy in their work. </p>
<p>The experience was a completely new one for Interact artists and

building new skills and confidence with their freeing and compassionate
methodologies. </p>
<p>Many of our performing artists have found new acting strengths
and successes through this technique that was not so with more traditional
acting methods.  We have found that many of our artists’ capability for
eye contact - onstage and off - has skyrocketed. Many have experienced
significant boosts in their concentration and physical awareness. Others still
have found their artistic spirits reignited by the playful yet rigorous working
environment.</p>
<p>We are raising funds to support this collaboration, which,
through the dedication and hard work of both companies, has provided a seminal
technical training for Interact artists.  <b>Your financial support will
make it possible for us to continue our relationship with The Bricklayers,

<p><b>About Interact: Creating Art to Challenge Perceptions of
Disability</b></p>
<p>Since 1996, Interact’s mission to create art that
challenges perceptions of disability has opened doors for artists with
disabilities and audiences eager to experience their work, who might never have
seen the arts as a life choice, but who now see the arts as essential to their
humanity. With over 125 artists working in theater and/or studio arts, Interact
is multi-cultural, intergenerational, and embraces the entire spectrum of
disability labels.</p>
<p>Interact’s work is driven by a vision of radical
inclusion. We collaborate with artists with and without disabilities, from
mainstream and marginalized communities, whose stories and life experiences are
the grist for our original, ensemble-generated theatrical work, and inspire the
spectrum of media that are created in our studio. Interact was the first – and
remains the only –visual and performing arts organization for artists with
disabilities, nationally or internationally, that is creating full-time at the
professional level, and sharing exciting seasons of performances and
exhibitions with our audiences</p>
<p><b>About The Bricklayers: The Mask Unmasks</b></p>
<p>The goal of our work at Interact has been
to first remove all external expressions and find one’s neutral point, humility
and openness.  This work then opens whole new avenues of creation. The
actors learn to control themselves under the pressure of performance and to
search beneath the surface of a first impulse, beyond the obvious and into the
intricacies and contradictions that make life and performance rich with
humanity.  This work refines the actor’s creativity, patience, engagement,
and their ability to communicate with their ensemble and community.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/609352/files/20140528073437-photo__37___1_indie.jpg?1401287677"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>About <i>Ship of Fools</i>: A Work in

<h3>About <i>Turbines Curatorial Collective</i><br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p><i>Turbines</i> is a burgeoning non-profit curatorial collective
that facilitates the production and presentation of socially- and/or politically-minded performance art in Kingston,
Ontario. Formed in January of 2014, the collective operates
using a consensus-based decision making model, and currently consists of six
members who identify as performance and visual artists, independent curators, activists,
and/or scholars of visual culture. By working
with existing arts-based and community organizations within Kingston, <i>Turbines</i> aims to bring together local, professional, international and emerging artists to create an opportunity for collaboration, mentorship,
and the sharing of artistic knowledges. Our main objective is to foster
dialogue and artistic exchanges through free events in order to make
performance art accessible to a wider community. </p>
<p>As a collective, <i>Turbines</i> believes that performance art
is an ideal medium for sparking new conversations and thoughts between
audiences, artists, and communities due to its immediacy, dynamism, and
interactive nature. We also believe that these same qualities make performance
art a perfect avenue for broaching difficult but important conversations about
the kinds of ideologies we inhabit. Interlacing art with social justice and an
overarching desire to make our world a more livable and enjoyable place for <i>all</i>
people, <i>Turbines</i> seeks to engage
artists, groups, communities and collectives who work to nurture feminist,
queer, trans*-positive, anti-racist, anti-colonialist, anti-ableist, and other forms of anti-oppressive
politics and ideologies. </p>

</div></div>","The goal is simple: I want to take this adorable Marshfellow figurine......and transform him into a cuddly, super-soft plush!The goal of $1,000 to just get started on the Plush! But there are so many more stretch goals that we all hope to achieve here together!What is a Marshfellow? A Marshfellow is a chubby, sweet-faced, little marshmallow creature made entirely out of love. For the past seven years Marshfellow fans have adorned their bookshelves, windowsills, desks, and counter tops with these super-cute collectibles. And for the past seven years I have heard and read this phrase over and over again: ""He's so cute I just wanna squeeze him!"" So, that is what I want to do! I want to be able to offer a high quality, super soft, and squeezable Marshfellow perfect for cuddling! The plush itself will be made of ultra-soft minky fabric, with embroidered eyes and mouth, and the Marshfellow signature blush pink cheeks! So take a load off and get a little toasted like one of our favorite Marshfellows while you wait for a plush!We've also created a Marshfellow Bar which is this super awesome shelf that you can hang on the wall to showcase all of your favorite Marshfellows!Marshfellows has partnered with Golden Bell's Stuffimals!Marc Goldner, Rachel Korsen, and Robert Gross are coming on as co-creators of the new Marshfellows cartoons, comics and all the merchandise! We wanted to unveil here on IndieGoGo before anywhere else what the world of Marshfellows is transforming into. We hope you're all excited!Each and every Marshfellows has been custom crafted and people have found a little bit of themselves in each and every one. With that process we hope to create a character that becomes part of the family from now on. In our opinion, no perfect plush is complete without a memorable story to go along with it. These stories are always fun while also teaching good values!What is the story about our favorite Marshfellows?Cute and cuddly, the Marshfellows live in a Marshmallowy world that's on the verge of being S'MORED by the chocolate and graham cracker countries. After years of separation between the other delicious kingdoms, the Marshfellow Prince embarks on an epic quest with an arrogant Chocolate Unicorn and a double-sided Graham Cracker Bear to bring order back to his once peaceful and cuddly kingdom. On their journey they'll deal with MarshVampires, Frankenfellow monstrosities, and of course try to stop the onslaught of the invading Zombie Marshfellow horde. The Zombiefellows are way too toasted and our Prince must find his father, who has been absent for a long time looking for the old magical fires and the mysterious Stick of Roasting to stop the dark, evil force that none of the homeless wizards know enough about. Every step of the way the Prince and his friends will have to deal with the fact that they're merely soft, delicate dessert food, no older than adolescents, living in an increasingly terrifying world of epic candy propositions. Like their quest to fend off monsters, our kids will combat the REAL fears of growing up and the challenges of managing new friendships.What Do Parents Say?""I absolutely LOVE my marshfellow unicorn!

<h3>Who are you and what is this?</h3>
<p>Ik ben Jeroen de Beer, een gepassioneerd bodybuilding en fitness fotograaf uit Tilburg. De meeste van jullie zullen me kennen via <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jeroendebeerfotografie/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>, waar ik vaak mijn werk plaats (en selfies ^_^). Na mijn studie psychologie besloot ik het roer om te gooien en van mijn passie mijn werk te maken. Ik wil iets doen waarvan ik tot leven kom, waar ik elke dag met plezier naartoe ga en waar ik trots op ben. Fast forward naar een jaar later en mijn droom is uitgekomen. Het is zelfs zo snel gegaan dat ik van mijn eerste studio, waar ik een jaar geleden ben begonnen, door wil verhuizen naar een grote loods! Daar kunnen jullie me bij helpen, want het is ook wel tof als ik die loods gelijk kan inrichten met een lading gymspullen!</p>
<p>Help mij mijn droom verder te verwezenlijken en jezelf aan de gaafste foto's ooit door me te steunen via deze campagne!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Wat ik nodig heb en wat jullie krijgen</h3>
<p>Voor een basis stukje sportschool in mijn nieuwe loods heb ik minimaal 5.000 euro nodig, maar hoe meer ik binnen haal hoe meer ik neer kan zetten en hoe toffer het wordt. Ik hoop met deze campagne 10.000 euro in te zamelen en dat zal allemaal naar de inrichting van de loods gaan.</p>
<p>Mocht het zo zijn dat ik veel meer dan dat inzamel, dan zet ik de rest opzij om in ieder geval een paar maanden de huur te kunnen betalen. Je kunt er in ieder geval verzekerd van zijn dat ik geen cruise naar de Bahama's boek op het moment dat ik het geld ontvang ;).</p>
<p>Als ik de 5.000 euro voor het stukje sportschool niet binnen haal is het ook geen probleem, dan leg ik de rest zelf bij. Voor mij is het vooral een mooie manier om in te schatten hoeveel animo er voor is en om iedereen enthousiast te krijgen over mijn nieuwe studio. </p>
<p>So what's in it for you? Op de eerste plek natuurlijk een ontzettend goed gevoel dat je iemand kunt steunen in het volgen van zijn hart en als je het specifiek doet omdat je mij wilt steunen een hele oprechte knuffel de eerste keer dat ik je (weer) zie! Maar ook leuke kortingen op de prijzen, one-of-a-kind shirts, handgeschreven bedankbriefjes, workshops en nog veel meer :)</p>
<p>Een van de grootste voordelen van het kopen van een bon is dat hij geldig is tot en met 2017. Het is het laatste jaar ongelofelijk snel gegaan en ik ben niet van plan any time soon gas terug te gaan nemen. Dat is samen gegaan met meerdere verhogingen van mijn prijzen, eigenlijk elke keer dat ik 3 maanden van tevoren volgeboekt ben gaan ze weer iets omhoog. Hetzelfde verwacht ik voor het komende jaar, dus als je weet dat je sowieso nog bij me op de foto wilt is dit het ideale moment!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Alle hulp is belangrijk en wordt gewaardeerd!</h3>
<p>Dit is de eerste keer ooit dat ik probeer iets te laten crowdfunden en ik vind het best wel spannend ^_^ Ik wil jullie in ieder geval op het hart drukken dat ik alle hulp ontzettend waardeer en ik jullie allemaal amazing vind!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risico's voor jullie</h3>
<p>Ik heb geprobeerd het risico zo klein mogelijk te houden voor jullie; de loods gaat sowieso door en je geld gaat nooit verloren, ik gebruik het altijd voor de inrichting en als het veel harder gaat dan ik verwacht steek ik alles terug in mijn bedrijf. Bovendien raak je je geld nooit kwijt; de bonnen zijn geldig tot en met 2017, maar als je om welke reden dan ooit geen afspraak kunt maken voor die tijd, krijg je het betaalde geld als korting op de dan geldige prijzen. </p>
<p>Je kunt je geld echter niet terug krijgen, ik ga er van uit dat je super enthousiast bent over mij als fotograaf en zeker weet dat je bij me op de foto wilt, bovendien gebruik ik al het ingezamelde geld voor de inrichting van mijn nieuwe studio, dus je kunt geen refund krijgen nadat de campagne afloopt.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Andere manieren waarop je me kunt helpen</h3>
<p>Als je met me meeleeft en me graag wilt helpen, zou ik het enorm waarderen als jullie wat mond-op-mond reclame willen maken voor mijn campagne in jullie gym en bij je vrienden. Als jullie mijn campagne willen sharen op facebook/instagram/where-ever ben ik jullie al helemaal eeuwig dankbaar, alle beetjes helpen veel meer dan je zou denken!</p>
<p>Ik wil jullie in ieder geval heel erg bedanken voor alle lieve berichtjes op instagram, alle mensen die hebben aangeboden te helpen en iedereen die met me mee leeft via social media!! Zonder jullie had ik deze campagne en deze (voor mij weer hele grote) stap nooit aangedurfd. <br/><br/>THANK YOU GUUUYS!!!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

My name is Todd Lacharite and I am a local promoter of music and the arts in Lethbridge, Alberta under the banner of Think Tank Events.
Lethbridge is just one city of many which is incredibly rich with talented local artists and musicians. I believe I have come up with a great way to get these individuals as well as other Canadians much needed exposure in a fun and unique way!
I will be organizing 52 Canadian artists and 52 Canadian bands to work together to create a unique poker size playing deck of cards called Shuffle Up & Deal 3: Audio/Visual.
Each artist will be teamed up with a musician/band to create an image which interprets the musician/band or their song that they have submitted. There will be 52 original and unique playing cards (plus the jokers).
The artwork will be showcased on the playing cards and then each musician/band will submit a recorded song. These songs can be then accessed by an online source as part of an album by the purchaser of the deck of cards.
There will also be index cards included in the deck of cards which will have a list of the artists and musicians as well as contact information or website to help promote them.

What We Need & What You Get
The goal of $6,000 is the least amount we need to produce and manufacture the cards. The more money we raise, the more we will be able to do (T-shirts, Art shows, concerts, & mass exposure of the deck of cards etc). And the sooner we hit the goal, the sooner you'll be able to see the finished deck.
These cards will make an awesome souvenir, gift and collector’s item that does Canada PROUD!

</div></div>","OUR STORY AND WHY
 
“The Post-Catastrophe Collaboration Workshop”, curated by Lydia Lunch, seeks to give agency to women by encouraging artistic empowerment especially inthese times of global chaos, media negativity and the devastating effects on the psyche of disaster capitalism and catastrophe that plagues the individual on a daily basis. 
-------------
For 3 days, in the Summer of 2012, Ateliers du Vent, a community art space in Rennes France, will become a collaborative and transformative exchange, for women and by women.  
The artists involved will cover a wide range of mediums from visual and practical applications of art to spoken word and dance. 
-------------
The outcome of this workshop will be realized in a collaborative group performance at Ateliers du Vent. 
The purpose of this event is to empower the women involved to form a global collective, which will encourage not only those in attendance, but spread a contagious enthusiasm to creative women everywhere.

What We Need & What You Get
 
Where our funding will go: Transportation and Accommodation 

- We need to cover the cost of accommodation, air and train transportation from The United States, France, Moldova and Spain for 9 artists. 
We will get supplemental grants toward these costs from sponsors solicited by Atelier du Vent.

Where our funding will go: DVD Documentation and SELECT CLIPS FOR ONLINE DOWNLOAD
- We want this to have a larger impact then to only those who can afford to come to Rennes, to SHARE the vision we aim to create documentation of the entire workshop and all of the collaborative performances and art created during these days.  
- The production of this DVD is a very important aspect to this event. The workshop is about sharing, exchange, and the furthering of ideas discussed at Atelier du Vent.  Artists from different countries and different generations will be represented at the space, and we hope to influence other countries and new generations through the production of a DVD, which when edited will then be available as an online download.

<h3>Photography As Justice</h3>
<p><span><strong>The idea is simple: </strong></span><span>put cameras into the hands of children around the world, educate them on how to use the camera and make a good composition, and then set them loose to take photos which are collected into books whose sales benefit the daily work of the NGO’s working with those children.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<h3><span><strong>A Brief History</strong></span></h3>
<p><span><em>World Through Their Eyes</em> began after watching the film <em>Born Into Brothels</em>, a documentary about director Zana Briski who went to India and discovered many children at risk of growing up into a life of sexual exploitation. Determined to not let this happen, she took her gifting of photography and spent a year with these children, training them how to take a great photo and eventually some of their work was featured in galleries around the world and the film also won the <em>Academy Award</em> for Best Documentary Feature in 2004. </span></p>
<p><span>Inspired, we decided to take cameras to Russia. Having already been working with the Detsky Dom’s (children’s homes) and a transition center for young people for the past couple of years, we chose to put cameras into the hands of the beautiful Russian children and raise money for the transition home through the book sales. In 2008, the first </span><span><strong>World Through Their Eyes | Russia</strong></span><span><em> </em>book was published and is still available on <a href=""http://www.lulu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lulu.com</a> for purchase.</span></p>

<h3>NOW: World Through Their Eyes: Congo</h3>
<p>In one month, I have been given the opportunity to travel with a team of friends to Africa. We will be going to the nations of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and the D.R. Congo. In Congo, I have been given permission to do the first <em>World Through Their Eyes</em> photobook in Congo! </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When we come home from Africa, we will take the book and make the first <em>World Through Their Eyes</em> book to be done on African soil: <strong>World Through Their Eyes | Congo</strong>. Every purchase of a book has it's sale divided into two costs: the printing of the book itself and the donation. In this case, all donations after printing costs will go towards the world being done in Congo. Here is what the costs will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Covering the costs of running and operating the Justice Rising schools</li>
<li>Helping rehabilitate children in the war-zone and redeeming their childhood</li>
<li>Help feed and clothe the men, women and children in Congo's redzone</li>
<li>Providing funds to establish businesses that create new livelihoods and improve the community</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>It's a Future-Forward Investment</h3>
<p>The cameras we will be purchasing will help us have the equipment we need to do this project in other countries! So far, we are already working on doing projects in Thailand and in India!</p>

His work ultimately asks challenging questions of us exemplified by our reactions to the work; highlighting the potential [and importance] of a minority’s perception of truth to resonate and impact the majority. <br/><br/>“<em>All art is political - because those that create art are governed by it</em>.” <br/><br/></p>

</h3> <p>Hi! My
name is Claire Reynes and papermaking is my passion. I started Zenith Art
Studio so I could share my love of handmade paper with my community, friends
and fellow artists.  Papermaking is such a unique medium because it can be both craft and fine art.  You will always succeed at making paper, whether you want to make plain white sheets to write thank you notes on later to creating a 2' x 4' colorful, swirling masterpiece with flowers embedded in the piece!  Paper can be sculptural with wire armatures or casted in a clay mold, it can be utilitarian as a paper lamp or bound in a journal, it can be huge or tiny, rough or smooth...  Papermaking is for EVERYONE.<br/></p>
<p><span>I have worked with so many different kinds of people - different ages, backgrounds, life experiences, goals...  Over the summer we had workshops for West Suburban Special Recreation Association where we made paper in a Nepalese style and explored the sensory aspect of papermaking and played with color and texture. We hosted the EcoRangers, summer day campers from the Oak Park Conservatory, in the studio for a couple days and talked about what it means to upcycle and how making paper from recycled t-shirts or from plant waste is a great way to do that!  We had a workshop at Maize Library in Oak Park with 50 years of age between our youngest and oldest participants!  I also was able to teach papermaking at the Puerto Rican Cultural Center for their After School Matters program and am getting ready for another after-school program at Longfellow Elementary in Oak Park, IL.  <br/></span></p>
<p>Papermaking has allowed me to work with all these different kinds of people and I feel so grateful for that.  I want to learn from and with others and to hopefully give them something in return, something that will resonate with them for the rest of their lives.  Even if they only make paper once, I hope that it is an experience that they never forget.  Zenith is really about creating an experience, not necessarily a masterpiece.  Let your life be your masterpiece.    <br/><span></span></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div> </div><p></p><div>
</div><p>Zenith Art
Studio needs to purchase some equipment to complete our professional<span>  papermaking
offerings. We still need a permanent paper beater, which is the main piece of equipment in a paper studio.  It allows us to transform old t-shirts and jeans, and also plant material into pulp that is then turned into paper.  We will give people
access to the equipment, space, and supplies that are often only available in
colleges or university type settings. By providing greater access we hope to
enable people to create amazing things that otherwise would be out of their
reach. </span></p><p><span>Equipment to purchase:</span></p><p><span>professional papermaking mold and deckles (varying sizes and styles)</span></p><p><span>storage units for renters and studio users</span></p><p><span>bolt of pellon</span></p><p><span>vats and stainless steel vat table</span></p><p><span>paper beater</span></p><p><span>stock cotton rag and abaca fibers</span></p><p><span>screenprinting mesh and photo emulsion for creating pulp imaging stencils</span></p><p><span>Epson printer</span></p><p><span>Bookbinding supplies for classes (japanese screw punch, nipping press, etc.)</span></p><p><span></span><span>Zenith sign!!!!</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>We also realize most people don’t
know much about the papermaking process or that papermaking can be an art form. We plan to use some of the money to let
our town know we are here and what we are all about. What good is a community
art studio if people don’t know your around.</span></p><div>
</div><p>Zenith will be a space that centers around community engagement and collaboration.  We want to open our doors to the community   In addition to one of the amazing perks you get for donating you will forever be one of our heroes!</p><p><strong>PERKS</strong></p><p><strong>Check out the gallery for more PERK PICTURES!!! If you are giving your perk to someone for the holidays this year let us know!! We can ship some of these items to you this week (excluding stickers, tshirts, sweatshirts)</strong></p><strong></strong><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1049186/files/20141126104617-sacred_geo_6.jpg?1417027577"" src="""" style=""width: 614.75px; height: 820px;""/></p><p>Sacred Geometry large pulp painting</p><p><br/></p><ul></ul><div>
</div> <div> </div><h3>The Impact</h3><div> </div><p></p><div>Zenith Art Studio offers workshops for beginners to experienced paper-makers. We offer classes on topics like, marbling paper, making paper from clothing fibers like t-shirts and  blue jeans, painting with paper pulp, creating watermarks in paper, and so much more!  We love sharing the possibilities of handmade paper with our neighbors  in a supportive, educational, and fun environment.</div><div><p>Zenith is establishing itself as a co-op art studio that provides a space for artists and non-artists to learn, explore, and collaborate using handmade paper and other media.  We also look for ways to partner with other community organizations, providing papermaking workshops on-location or in the studio.  So far, we've had the pleasure of working with the Oak Park Conservatory, Longfellow Elementary, The Oak Park Library, and WSSRA and look forward to more opportunities to collaborate with these groups and many more in the area.<br/></p></div><ul></ul><div>

 Hi! My
name is Claire Reynes and papermaking is my passion. I started Zenith Art
Studio so I could share my love of handmade paper with my community, friends
and fellow artists.  Papermaking is such a unique medium because it can be both craft and fine art.  You will always succeed at making paper, whether you want to make plain white sheets to write thank you notes on later to creating a 2' x 4' colorful, swirling masterpiece with flowers embedded in the piece!  Paper can be sculptural with wire armatures or casted in a clay mold, it can be utilitarian as a paper lamp or bound in a journal, it can be huge or tiny, rough or smooth...  Papermaking is for EVERYONE.
I have worked with so many different kinds of people - different ages, backgrounds, life experiences, goals...  Over the summer we had workshops for West Suburban Special Recreation Association where we made paper in a Nepalese style and explored the sensory aspect of papermaking and played with color and texture. We hosted the EcoRangers, summer day campers from the Oak Park Conservatory, in the studio for a couple days and talked about what it means to upcycle and how making paper from recycled t-shirts or from plant waste is a great way to do that!  We had a workshop at Maize Library in Oak Park with 50 years of age between our youngest and oldest participants!  I also was able to teach papermaking at the Puerto Rican Cultural Center for their After School Matters program and am getting ready for another after-school program at Longfellow Elementary in Oak Park, IL.  
Papermaking has allowed me to work with all these different kinds of people and I feel so grateful for that.  I want to learn from and with others and to hopefully give them something in return, something that will resonate with them for the rest of their lives.  Even if they only make paper once, I hope that it is an experience that they never forget.  Zenith is really about creating an experience, not necessarily a masterpiece.  Let your life be your masterpiece.    
   What We Need & What You Get 
Zenith Art
Studio needs to purchase some equipment to complete our professional  papermaking
offerings. We still need a permanent paper beater, which is the main piece of equipment in a paper studio.  It allows us to transform old t-shirts and jeans, and also plant material into pulp that is then turned into paper.  We will give people
access to the equipment, space, and supplies that are often only available in
colleges or university type settings. By providing greater access we hope to
enable people to create amazing things that otherwise would be out of their
reach. Equipment to purchase:professional papermaking mold and deckles (varying sizes and styles)storage units for renters and studio usersbolt of pellonvats and stainless steel vat tablepaper beaterstock cotton rag and abaca fibersscreenprinting mesh and photo emulsion for creating pulp imaging stencilsEpson printerBookbinding supplies for classes (japanese screw punch, nipping press, etc.)Zenith sign!!!!We also realize most people don’t
know much about the papermaking process or that papermaking can be an art form. We plan to use some of the money to let
our town know we are here and what we are all about. What good is a community
art studio if people don’t know your around.
Zenith will be a space that centers around community engagement and collaboration.  We want to open our doors to the community   In addition to one of the amazing perks you get for donating you will forever be one of our heroes!PERKSCheck out the gallery for more PERK PICTURES!!! If you are giving your perk to someone for the holidays this year let us know!! We can ship some of these items to you this week (excluding stickers, tshirts, sweatshirts)Sacred Geometry large pulp painting
  The Impact Zenith Art Studio offers workshops for beginners to experienced paper-makers. We offer classes on topics like, marbling paper, making paper from clothing fibers like t-shirts and  blue jeans, painting with paper pulp, creating watermarks in paper, and so much more!  We love sharing the possibilities of handmade paper with our neighbors  in a supportive, educational, and fun environment.Zenith is establishing itself as a co-op art studio that provides a space for artists and non-artists to learn, explore, and collaborate using handmade paper and other media.  We also look for ways to partner with other community organizations, providing papermaking workshops on-location or in the studio.  So far, we've had the pleasure of working with the Oak Park Conservatory, Longfellow Elementary, The Oak Park Library, and WSSRA and look forward to more opportunities to collaborate with these groups and many more in the area.

Throughout graduate school I have made work dealing with grief and loss, specifically focused on mourning people who have already passed away. Memories erode. People pass away. Loss and death are common human experiences, and as we age, we are all confronted by the deaths of those around us, as well as by our own mortality. While some accept these experiences as a part of life, many people—including myself—struggle with these inevitabilities on a daily basis.</font></p><p></p><p>My new work focuses <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">on dealing with my parents’ mortality and preparing
for their future deaths. They pose as corpses in isolated natural settings, and I then
cover their photographed images with hand-drawn shrouds of flowers. The
ritualized process of burial and ceremony helps lend order to the often
overwhelming experience of death. I use the ritualized process of drawing—the
slow, meticulous use of repeated marks and forms—to help me come to terms with their eventual deaths.</span></p><h1><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</span></h1><p></p><p>Creating this work requires a high-end, high megapixel camera so I can make large photographic prints (7 feet by 10 feet), as well as a couple rolls of high quality paper to make the prints on. I will also need lots of little things like new gouache, watercolor, brushes, etc. Any contributed money will help me pay for these items, making my thesis project possible!<br/></p><p>$4,000 will help pay for these materials. Any money above and beyond will help me buy other items, such as extra paper, digital editing programs, and other art supplies.<br/><br/>For donation perks, I am offering letterpress cards, digital prints of my art, as well as original works of art. Images of perks can be seen below.</p><h1><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Impact</span></h1><p></p><p>100 years ago most deaths took place at home. In America today, most deaths take place in institutions, such as hospitals or nursing homes. Morticians are largely in charge of dealing with dead bodies leading to a gradual removal from interacting with death and the dead. 
Death is often an avoided subject, a gaping
chasm at the end of each of our lives around which we tiptoe, but birth and
death are the two human experiences which we all share. To die is to be human.</p><p>Through my work, I deal with my own fears surrounding death. However, I also hope to bring death back into conversation. Often when people find out my work is about death and loss, their first question is ""are you ok?"" Inferring that because I am thinking about death that I must be depressed. Death is scary. It does make me sad, but it is also a huge part of life. I think talking about death makes it less scary. I think dealing with this eventuality through ritual, through ceremony, and through community rather than as individuals also makes it less scary. Lastly, death is beautiful. Without death there wouldn't be room for new life.</p><h1><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Other Ways to Help</span></h1><p></p><p>I know some people can’t afford to contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p><ul>

Throughout graduate school I have made work dealing with grief and loss, specifically focused on mourning people who have already passed away. Memories erode. People pass away. Loss and death are common human experiences, and as we age, we are all confronted by the deaths of those around us, as well as by our own mortality. While some accept these experiences as a part of life, many people—including myself—struggle with these inevitabilities on a daily basis.My new work focuses on dealing with my parents’ mortality and preparing
for their future deaths. They pose as corpses in isolated natural settings, and I then
cover their photographed images with hand-drawn shrouds of flowers. The
ritualized process of burial and ceremony helps lend order to the often
overwhelming experience of death. I use the ritualized process of drawing—the
slow, meticulous use of repeated marks and forms—to help me come to terms with their eventual deaths.What I Need & What You GetCreating this work requires a high-end, high megapixel camera so I can make large photographic prints (7 feet by 10 feet), as well as a couple rolls of high quality paper to make the prints on. I will also need lots of little things like new gouache, watercolor, brushes, etc. Any contributed money will help me pay for these items, making my thesis project possible!$4,000 will help pay for these materials. Any money above and beyond will help me buy other items, such as extra paper, digital editing programs, and other art supplies.For donation perks, I am offering letterpress cards, digital prints of my art, as well as original works of art. Images of perks can be seen below.Impact100 years ago most deaths took place at home. In America today, most deaths take place in institutions, such as hospitals or nursing homes. Morticians are largely in charge of dealing with dead bodies leading to a gradual removal from interacting with death and the dead. 
Death is often an avoided subject, a gaping
chasm at the end of each of our lives around which we tiptoe, but birth and
death are the two human experiences which we all share. To die is to be human.Through my work, I deal with my own fears surrounding death. However, I also hope to bring death back into conversation. Often when people find out my work is about death and loss, their first question is ""are you ok?"" Inferring that because I am thinking about death that I must be depressed. Death is scary. It does make me sad, but it is also a huge part of life. I think talking about death makes it less scary. I think dealing with this eventuality through ritual, through ceremony, and through community rather than as individuals also makes it less scary. Lastly, death is beautiful. Without death there wouldn't be room for new life.Other Ways to HelpI know some people can’t afford to contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:
Get the word out and share this campaign.
Talk about death with someone you love

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style="""">On
December 31, 2010, state
and federal correctional authorities had jurisdiction over 1,605,127 prisoners.
It is no surprise that there are many talented artists who are away from home.
Prodigious Penn is a gallery for inmate art. Ours is simply an effort to bridge
gaps, provide a positive outlet and bring such talent to light. We have been in
contact with artists across the country from Comstock,
 New York to Crescent
  City, California. All of the
responses have been positive; this has translated into an overwhelming desire
by the artists to create, share and expand personal horizons. Many of the
artists' basic necessities may not be provided by the institutions in which
they are housed. We are Prodigious Penn.
Our artists receive the majority of the proceeds from anything we put into the
hands of private collectors. In an effort to remain impartial, we only display
the art, the artist's name and the media used to create the art. Our artists
have to be resourceful and creative. The artists want to spend time bettering
themselves in a productive manner and we intend to help.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There are several positive outcomes for our artists. Some
have families who they would like to help financially. Many require basic
necessities, such as clothing, toiletries, and believe it or not, food which
may not be provided by the facility in which they are housed. Some artists are
building a portfolio they can access upon their release and intend to make a
career utilizing their artistic abilities. Our artists see it as an opportunity
to further their talents and share with art enthusiasts in the outside world. Some
simply see it as a productive way to spend their time.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our artists could use help with art supplies, postage and books,
publications, etc., in order to fuel their creativity, expand their artistic
horizons and reinforce their positive outlooks. Prodigious Penn could use help
to fund web-hosting, purchase postage to keep in contact with artists, pay for vendor
space fees and to purchase display items such as tables, frames and matting for
public display. A musician style flight case is needed for art in order to keep it in its
original condition, fabric and lights are needed for the display. Promotional materials such as posters, flyers and business
cards are imperative in order to gain as much exposure as possible for our artists. If our goal is not reached, any proceeds collected will go directly to these
needs. Those who have donated still receive perks in relation to the amount donated
as well as a warm and fuzzy feeling knowing that you helped those who wish to
help themselves in a productive manner. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Make some noise about our campaign! Tell your Facebook, Twitter or other
social network friends about us and direct them to our website and IndieGoGo
campaign pages. Talk about us at work, church, school, on the bus or wherever
you strike up a conversation. Start a conversation with ""I just saw this
thing on the internet called Prodigious Pennâ€¦"" and see where it goes from
there! </p>

anybody who is in the same position as our artists, get in touch with them and
tell them about us. They'll be happy to hear from you and we'd appreciate you passing
along our story. We could use any help you're willing to give so thank you very
much for spreading the word!</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p></div>","Our Story
