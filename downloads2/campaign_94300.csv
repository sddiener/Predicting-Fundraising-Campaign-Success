The book was previously successfully funded on Indiegogo in April 2015 and went on to become the most reviewed Peak District publication on Amazon with over 80 five-star reviews. In just over 18 months, the book had completely sold out.</p><h3>Why I need your help?</h3><p>Peak District Through The Lens is my proudest achievement and I'm super happy it was such a success. I had considered to move on as I had more than achieved what I originally set out to. However, the demand for the book is still very high, with people emailing, asking me at talks and just in general where they can get a copy and when would I be reprinting it. However, the only way I can make this happen is with your help. As you can imagine, a book of this size is costly to print, especially at the high quality I require. So I've decided to set up this Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign to try and help raise some of the funds to allow a reprint to be ordered. </p><h3>Why choose my book:</h3><p>The book has been very well received everywhere and I still hear so many comments about how it's the go-to book. The reviews speak for themselves (See down below) and it's no wonder the book sold out so quickly. You will be buying a product that is tried, tested and trusted. In fact, the only critique about the book that has been pointed out is it's size, somewhat of a tomb! This can only mean you're getting a super high-quality book jam packed with information.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499286130/msgb0g5davouygcsogqn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Included in the book:</h3><p>400 Pages</p><p>Over 300 viewpoints within 80+ locations.

I also want to return to the area where it all started many years ago, and capture additional photographs of one of the most beautiful places on earth.Namaqualand and the Richtersveld.Namaqualand is a semi-desert region situated inland on the West Coast of the Northern Cape Province in South Africa. It is known for its spectacular annual wild flowers in early Spring (August to September). The Richtersveld is situated above Namaqualand on the North Western 
border of South Africa and Namibia. The Richtersveld Transfrontier Park 
is an UNESCO World Heritage site due to the biodiversity that is found 
in this unique Mountain Desert. Many species of succulent plants occur 
nowhere else on earth.My background and experience:I earn a living as a 3D Visual Effects Artist in the Film and Television Industry. My passion for photography started in Art School when I studied Graphic Design and had Photography as a subject. As I live in South Africa, unspoilt wide open spaces and breathtaking wildlife is always just a road trip away.Even though photography is more of a passion than a job for me, my photographs are widely published Internationally. Companies and Organizations that published my photographs include National Geographic, The Smithsonian, UNESCO, Cambridge University, Princeton University, Oxford University, Kew Botanic Garden  and many other mainstream publishers. My two previous books are currently on sale at Amazon, Apple iStore and Blurb.   | National Geographic Magazine | NatGeo News | Amazon | iStore | Blurb |  Due to my Graphic Design background, I am able to do the book Layout and Design myself. This will keep costs down and allow me complete creative control.How the funds will be used:As I've been going on photographic excursions in Southern Africa for many years, I am not new to planning this kind of trip. From experience I have learnt what is involved logistically when you take the road less travelled, and travel on the back routes in remote areas with hardly any infrastructure or people. This is actually part of the appeal and always leads to adventure, unexpected discovery and great photographic opportunities.Fuel:On trips of this nature over vast distances, fuel costs have become one of the largest cost contributing factors. As infrastructure is sparse, one needs to have additional fuel and other essential provisions with you.Equipment Rental:I have made substantial investments in camera equipment over the years, and experience has taught me that it is not wise to change lenses too often in these dusty desert environments. I usually take my older backup camera along with a different lens on. To keep costs down, I simply rent an additional lens for the duration of the trip.Vehicle:All the great photo opportunities are a bit off the beaten track. For most part my SUV is sufficient, but in some of the off-road mountain passes it is crucial to have a high clearance 4x4 vehicle with a low-range gearbox. I will need to rent a suitable vehicle to complete the last section of the trip through the rough terrain of the Richtersveld.Pre-Print Costs:At least two test prints of the book is required before final sign-off. Estimated book completion:Early 2015
High Quality Printing:As with my previous books, I am planning to self publish via Blurb again. This has the added benefit of allowing me to use high quality printing techniques and photographic quality paper that is typically not an option when one takes the high volume mass printing route. High quality printing at lower volumes make the book more exclusive, but does add additional cost at the printing stage.If a publisher of high quality books can persuade me otherwise, I will consider a more traditional publishing route as it will lower the book's selling price.Book Format:
Low volume Hard Cover Coffee Table Book.
Signed Limited Edition Hard Cover Coffee Table Book.
eBook.
The role of Sponsors:On these trips I ""rough it"" and camp when possible to keep costs down. There are great opportunities for Companies that supply Photographic and Outdoor Camping equipment to get involved. I am open to any form of sponsorship deal that will help make the project a success.Time to get out of the city and go where the air is clean, and the streets have no names.Martin P Heigan",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

  Hey, my name is Guy Raivitz and I'm a photographer (among other things) from Israel. Currently I live in Canada where I did my MFA at Ryerson University. In the fall my family and I are going back home – hopefully with this book in full production.    
  Hard and Stubborn Love is a photographic journey in the turbulent Israeli reality of the mid 2000′s. It is my first book project and it took more then five year to complete it; in fact when I started working on this project I didn’t know it was going to be a book.
 At that time I was taking a lot of pictures however I was not satisfied, I felt I was doing the same thing all over again.

<p>Death by Dying is an award-winning fiction podcast about the Obituary Writer of Crestfall, Idaho investigating a series of strange and mysterious deaths… when he is supposed to simply be writing obituaries.

Now we need your help to continue the adventure...</p>
<p>Now, the Obituary Writer is looking for Charlotte, but he isn’t the only one searching for answers. Mia Jasper, criminal law student, is following her own curious trail of clues surrounding the most recent string of deaths.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>~ Our Goal ~</strong></h3>
<p>We’d love a trip to the Bahamas. And Evan wants a golden 1932 portable Underwood typewriter. Oh, for the production? Right. Season 2 will consist of 8 episodes, with over 25 new characters joining the fun! To make this possible, we are asking for $7,000. As a team of two, we need your help to hit the ground running.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our #1 goal is for all of our hard working cast and crew to be paid fairly for their time and talents. From coordinating remote recording sessions to keep things COVID-safe, to the countless hours we spend bringing this show to your earholes through writing and editing, we have quite the journey ahead of us. But with your help, new obituaries from Crestfall will be here before you know it. We pride ourselves in producing a professional audio fiction show independently. In order to make that a reality, we need the dubloons to keep the lanterns lit and our artists and performers fairly compensated.</span></p>
<p>If you're not in a position to donate to this fundraiser, help us by spreading the word. Tell someone who doesn't yet listen to the show about it. Let the world know there is a fundraiser. Retweet, share, or spread the word in your own way to help us make Season 2 possible.</p>

We’ve been blown away by artwork and fanfiction inspired from our show. We have been overwhelmed by the support for these absurd obituaries, and are humbled by what our stories have meant to you all.</span><br/> <p>Death by Dying is here to bring you laughter, catharsis, and healing. It is a place to find joy in the absurd and comfort through grief and hardship. Thank you for everything. Let’s tell some more stories from the strange, little town of Crestfall, Idaho, and its modestly handsome Obituary Writer.</p>

We’d love a trip to the Bahamas. And Evan wants a golden 1932 portable Underwood typewriter. Oh, for the production? Right. Season 2 will consist of 8 episodes, with over 25 new characters joining the fun! To make this possible, we are asking for $7,000. As a team of two, we need your help to hit the ground running.
Our #1 goal is for all of our hard working cast and crew to be paid fairly for their time and talents. From coordinating remote recording sessions to keep things COVID-safe, to the countless hours we spend bringing this show to your earholes through writing and editing, we have quite the journey ahead of us. But with your help, new obituaries from Crestfall will be here before you know it. We pride ourselves in producing a professional audio fiction show independently. In order to make that a reality, we need the dubloons to keep the lanterns lit and our artists and performers fairly compensated.
If you're not in a position to donate to this fundraiser, help us by spreading the word. Tell someone who doesn't yet listen to the show about it. Let the world know there is a fundraiser. Retweet, share, or spread the word in your own way to help us make Season 2 possible.

~ We Love This Show ~
It has been a massive and meaningful part of our lives for the past three years, and we want to create this next season with the care that it deserves. 
We have traveled from coast to coast to meet audience members at conventions. We’ve been blown away by artwork and fanfiction inspired from our show. We have been overwhelmed by the support for these absurd obituaries, and are humbled by what our stories have meant to you all. Death by Dying is here to bring you laughter, catharsis, and healing. It is a place to find joy in the absurd and comfort through grief and hardship. Thank you for everything. Let’s tell some more stories from the strange, little town of Crestfall, Idaho, and its modestly handsome Obituary Writer.

~ The Creators ~
Evan Gulock (left): Writer, Voice of the Obituary Writer, Social Media Manager, and Music Supervisor. Evan studied Film at Columbia College Chicago with a concentration in screenwriting. He has always been deeply inspired by dark whimsy, from the work of Edward Gorey to the delightfully grim tales of A Series of Unfortunate Events. His passion for Death by Dying came from a desire to tell a story that blended humor and horror while still having an emotional core to its characters. He enjoys long walks on the beach in the middle of a thunderstorm. Niko Gerentes (right): Producer, Casting / Vocal Director, Recording Engineer, Sound Designer, The Man of a Thousand Voices. Since he was a spritely young man, Niko has been tinkering with digital audio workstations to create EDM and comedy rap songs about Pumpkin Spice Lattes. He created an Interdisciplinary degree between Radio, Sound For Cinema, Music Recording, and studied Voiceover at Columbia College Chicago. He currently works at a voiceover recording studio in Los Angeles helping out on video games like Gears 5, Astral Chain, and the Final Fantasy series.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I have ADHD, and I decided that it won't define me or my success. That’s why I created the ADHD Melly Show! I needed a safe space where I could share my successes as well as my daily struggles. But mostly I wanted to show the world that neurodiversity is a real, and success is possible all the same.</p>
<p>Each week, I have the pleasure to sit down and speak with people that have seen success, share their story, and hear their tips on how they made their dream life possible. I know that together, we can make a difference in this world.</p>
<p>I still can't believe how much I have grown during this process and just how many people we have inspired. I know that The ADHD Melly Show will improve greatly over time, and I do believe that together, we can inspire even more people.</p>
<p>Of course, we can't do it alone! That's why I created this Indiegogo campaign: we are stronger together.</p>
<p>I know that our show can succeed, and so far I have invested my time and money to make it work. But I'm reaching the point where the upkeep of the show isn't sustainable, so I need your help for the show to reach its full potential!</p>

<p><strong>LINER NOTES</strong>- a podcast that provides a jazz artist with a platform to speak about their process while giving the listener a window into the human being behind the music. Hosted by saxophonist <strong>David Bixler</strong>. That’s me and that is the tag line for my podcast.</p>
<p><strong>LINER NOTES</strong> was initially conceived of to fulfill a gap in jazz education as well as to shine a light on artists that are working hard to produce great music. Each month I interview a different jazz artist to discuss their music, career, and life—information that formerly was found on the backs of album covers and in the notes of CDs but is sometimes hard to find in the era of downloadable and streamed music.</p>
<p>A review of my interviewees to date demonstrates an intention to give voice to people from the many cultures, ethnicities, and genders that make this music rich.</p>
<p>From the beginning of <strong>LINER NOTES</strong> I have relied on support from <strong>Vandoren</strong> and the institution where I teach. While I am grateful for the continued support form <strong>Vandoren</strong>, the institutional support is no longer available.</p>
<p>Improvising thrives on change and this change has gotten me excited about taking <strong>LINER NOTES</strong> to a different, and hopefully better place.</p>
<p>In order to fund the studio time, engineering, transcription services, etc-all the infrastructure necessary to keep this afloat I am seeking funding through this Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>The episodes in the last year and a half have been documenting how musicians are coping with the pandemic along with the racial and political turmoil that is defining this era.</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Strange Stories to Tell Yourself is a fictional podcast that twists horror and the absurd into a series of short stories, all told from the second person perspective. Through the blending of storytelling and production design, the listener will be brought into each story as the titular narrator “you”, immersed within the uncanny world described to them. We hope to achieve this strong connection to the listener through the use of narration, music, sound effects and other production design as well as the performance of local voice actors. </p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>We’re a team of writers, producers, and lovers of the strange and uncanny, based in Toronto, Canada. Leah Smith, our Creator, Producer &amp; Writer, had long dreamed of creating a second-person, unsettling audio drama, and in February of 2020, she brought Adrian Muhajarine (Writer &amp; Audio Lead) and Alice Gauntley (Writer) on board to bring this vision to life. We were soon joined by Lindsay Sadler (Writer &amp; Artist) and Michal Heuston (Producer &amp; Editor), and as the COVID-19 pandemic brought a sense of unreality to our world, we dove into planning and writing the first season of Strange Stories to Tell Yourself. </p>
<p>We’re an interdisciplinary team with the skills to pull off a project like this: </p>
<p>Leah Smith is a television development professional, writer and director, and a graduate of the RTA School of Media. She currently works in research and development at Go Button Media, and was the head writer of the indie horror series Winterbourne, which Michal created and produced.</p>
<p>Michal Heuston is a filmmaker and editor and also a graduate of RTA. Michal was the editor on Body So Fluorescent, a short film that premiered at this year's Inside Out Festival. They were also a co-editor and the post-production supervisor on Nancy's Workshop, a short documentary film for the CBC Short Docs program and an official selection at this year's Hot Docs Festival. </p>
<p>Adrian Muhajarine is a writer and audio producer, originally from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and another RTA graduate. He’s currently exploring his love of podcasting as the Associate Producer of Entertainment One's Podcast Network. </p>
<p>Alice Gauntley is a writer of stories that are literary, speculative, both, and neither. Her work has appeared in Plenitude, EVENT, and Grain magazines, among other publications. </p>
<p>Lindsay is a writer and a recent graduate of the University of Guelph, graduating with honours from the English department with a minor in Creative Writing, where she was nominated twice for the Tompkins Essay Prize. </p>
<h3>The Budget</h3>
<p>The majority of our funds raised from Indiegogo will go towards paying our actors, as you can see below in this pie chart: </p>

</div></div>","The Project
Strange Stories to Tell Yourself is a fictional podcast that twists horror and the absurd into a series of short stories, all told from the second person perspective. Through the blending of storytelling and production design, the listener will be brought into each story as the titular narrator “you”, immersed within the uncanny world described to them. We hope to achieve this strong connection to the listener through the use of narration, music, sound effects and other production design as well as the performance of local voice actors. 
The Team
We’re a team of writers, producers, and lovers of the strange and uncanny, based in Toronto, Canada. Leah Smith, our Creator, Producer & Writer, had long dreamed of creating a second-person, unsettling audio drama, and in February of 2020, she brought Adrian Muhajarine (Writer & Audio Lead) and Alice Gauntley (Writer) on board to bring this vision to life. We were soon joined by Lindsay Sadler (Writer & Artist) and Michal Heuston (Producer & Editor), and as the COVID-19 pandemic brought a sense of unreality to our world, we dove into planning and writing the first season of Strange Stories to Tell Yourself. 
We’re an interdisciplinary team with the skills to pull off a project like this: 
Leah Smith is a television development professional, writer and director, and a graduate of the RTA School of Media. She currently works in research and development at Go Button Media, and was the head writer of the indie horror series Winterbourne, which Michal created and produced.
Michal Heuston is a filmmaker and editor and also a graduate of RTA. Michal was the editor on Body So Fluorescent, a short film that premiered at this year's Inside Out Festival. They were also a co-editor and the post-production supervisor on Nancy's Workshop, a short documentary film for the CBC Short Docs program and an official selection at this year's Hot Docs Festival. 
Adrian Muhajarine is a writer and audio producer, originally from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and another RTA graduate. He’s currently exploring his love of podcasting as the Associate Producer of Entertainment One's Podcast Network. 
Alice Gauntley is a writer of stories that are literary, speculative, both, and neither. Her work has appeared in Plenitude, EVENT, and Grain magazines, among other publications. 
Lindsay is a writer and a recent graduate of the University of Guelph, graduating with honours from the English department with a minor in Creative Writing, where she was nominated twice for the Tompkins Essay Prize. 
The Budget
The majority of our funds raised from Indiegogo will go towards paying our actors, as you can see below in this pie chart: 

It’s important to us that those we hire outside of our team are compensated for their time! We strongly believe that artists should be paid for their work. The remaining portion of the funds will go towards covering the costs of distributing Strange Stories to Tell Yourself, to ensure that it’s readily accessible once fully released.
What happens if we don't meet our goal? Please don’t make us act! Unfortunately should we not be able to meet our goal, we will have to entertain the idea of performing ourselves. If you’ve made it this far, you should know that we are not trained actors. We would like to hire trained actors, however, so we would appreciate any amount that can be given! Additionally, not reaching our funding goal will set us back in our production schedule as we take the time we need to explore other avenues of financing.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Take Us Back to Proxima!</h2>
<p>It's finally time to find out what happened after the Contact Day Incident. Will you help us tell the story?</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">About</h2>
<p>Season One tells the story of a stratified –– both literally and figuratively –– Windfall City, where the wealthy live in luxury condos in towering skyscrapers and the poor reside far away from the sunlight on the ground of the planet Proxima. Lording over this great city is the mysterious Queen Wanda and her robotic advisor, Tin Man, who appeared in the sky twenty years ago. While our drama involves a large cast of characters, the story centers around three brothers –– Shaima, Cas and Argus –– and the ragtag group they befriend along the way.</p>
<p>The second season is set six months after the events of the Season One Finale, where a powerful alien force attacked Windfall City during its holiest festival, Contact Day. Forced into the sewers, the grounders have adapted to the occupation of Windfall City by remaining hidden. However, more and more Proximans arrive every day, creating a housing and food crisis among their ranks. Meanwhile, Queen Wanda’s worldview has been thrown into disarray as she learns more about the circumstances of her arrival in Windfall City when she was just a baby. At the same time, the attack on Windfall City has created a power vacuum on the ground floor into which Mila has happily taken over. In the midst of this chaos, Cas, Shaima and Gertie have one looming question: where is Argus?</p>

<p>Thanks to the generous donations from our backers on Patreon, we have enough funds to pay our talented cast of voice actors for this upcoming season, and we have new additions to the show we can’t wait to introduce!</p>
<p>For Season One of Windfall we brought our entire cast together to record in Syracuse, New York over the course of a single week. It was a blast! Unfortunately, with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic we aren’t comfortable asking our cast to get together this time around, and we don’t want to continue pushing the production of Season Two, so we’ve decided to record this season remotely.</p>
<p>While we’re excited to get back into recording this show we love so much, this style of recording will put a particular strain on our post-production crew. In an effort to bring this season to your ears as quickly as possible, we’re raising funds here on IndieGoGo to hire additional sound designers to help with dialogue editing and sound design for this season.</p>
<p>Our initial goal is $8,500, which breaks down as:</p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>Dialogue Editing - $200 per episode (x12)</li>
<li>Sound Design - $200 per episode (x12)</li>

For a donation of $500, we’ll have lunch and some great discussion together. If you’re feeling especially helpful and generous, for a donation of support of $1,000 or more, I’d be happy to speak to your group or organization followed by a Meet & Greet. If you're interested in supporting as a sponsor or benefactor on a longer-term basis, please contact me. bucca@aol.comI’ve been doing noncompromising and award-winning journalism since 1977, and I hope you will take this opportunity to help me keep doing it.

<p>Todas las semanas nos escuchas desde <strong>Colombia</strong>, <strong>España</strong>, <strong>Chile</strong>, <strong>Argentina</strong>, <strong>Perú</strong>, <strong>Ecuador</strong>, <strong>Costa Rica</strong>, <strong>Cuba</strong>, <strong>Puerto Rico</strong>, <strong>Panamá</strong>, <strong>Canadá</strong>, <strong>México</strong>, <strong>Inglaterra</strong>, <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Italia</strong>, <strong>Francia</strong>, <strong>Estados Unidos</strong> y hasta en <strong>Bakú, Azerbaijan</strong>.</p>

<p>Tenemos un año y más de 50 episodios haciéndolo.</p>
<p>Ahora estamos aquí para que nos ayudes a conocerte en persona.</p>
<p>Para eso inventamos el <strong>No sé, dime tour</strong>.</p>
<p>Y queremos que una de sus paradas sea la bella ciudad de <strong>Madrid</strong>, en <b>España</b>.</p>
<h3>Qué es el <i>No sé, dime tour MADRID</i>
</h3>
<p>Agarrar nuestras maletas para ir a <b>Madrid</b>, encontrar un teatro para grabar en vivo nuestro podcast contigo muerto de risa en el público, invitar a un ""salmón"" famoso de <b>España</b> para que se siente con nosotros (si no has escuchado el podcast, no sabes qué es un ""salmón""... ¡cambia eso de ti!) y nos deje entrevistarlo para que nos cuente por qué también siente que no pertenece, documentar todo nuestro viaje con un equipo de profesionales audiovisuales de cada ciudad y convertir nuestro pequeño podcast casero en un programa de TV de verdad en el que los protagonistas son los <i>#superdiamantes</i> que nos escuchan en todo el mundo.</p>
<h3><b>Cómo queremos hacerlo</b></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Hacer un programa como este es súper ambicioso. No solo tienes que invertir en la producción del evento, en los pasajes, en el alojamiento, sino también en trabajar con un equipo de profesionales con la experiencia suficiente para garantizar que el resultado final no tenga nada que envidiarle a programas que puedes ver en lugares como <strong>Netflix</strong> o <strong>HBO</strong>.</p>
<p>A lo mejor no lo sabes, pero un sólo episodio de un programa así puede llegar a costar cientos de miles de dólares en el mundo real.</p>
<h3>Por qué nosotros</h3>
<p>Si nos conoces sabes que desde hace años hemos desarrollado proyectos para <strong>Youtube</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>Snap Inc</strong>, <strong>Batanga Media</strong>, <strong>AOL</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>HLN</strong>, <strong>Univision</strong>,<strong> Discovery</strong>, <strong>NBC Universo</strong>, <strong>Mitú</strong>, <strong>Fullscreen</strong>, <strong>Clevver TV</strong>, <strong>Broadway Video</strong> y marcas como <strong>McDonalds</strong>, <strong>Bud Light</strong>, <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Volvo</strong>, <strong>Ford</strong>, <strong>Covergirl</strong>, <strong>Makeup Forever</strong>, <strong>Best Buy</strong>, <strong>Target</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Johnny Walker</strong>, entre muchas otras.</p>
<p>Parte de las cosas que hemos hecho las puedes encontrar <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8_L7fhCwtqLA4ATvFtS52w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">aquí</a>. </p>
<p>Juntos hemos estado nominados a los <a href=""https://www.tubefilter.com/2013/02/21/visto-bueno-international-series/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Streamy Awards</a> 3 veces (más veces que cualquier creador Latino)</p>

<p>Luego creamos este podcast y han hablado de él en <a href=""http://la.eonline.com/mexico/enews/la-youtuber-que-decidio-compartir-los-bochornos-las-penas-y-la-soledad-de-ser-una-youtuber/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">E!

<p>Pero nada de eso importa tanto como que tú lo veas y escuches cada semana.</p>
<p>Por eso esto queremos llevarlo a otro nivel y hacerlo teniendo control del proyecto y dejando que seas tú mismo quién está detrás de esto.</p>
<p>Queremos algo de superdiamantes para superdiamantes.</p>
<p>Y aunque nosotros somos buenos consiguiendo ayuda y haciendo que cosas de ultra bajo presupuesto se vean bien, aún así necesitamos un monto mínimo para poder llevar el <strong>No sé, dime tour</strong> a cada país.</p>
<p><strong>No hacemos esto para hacernos millonarios</strong>, pero sí creemos que con tu ayuda podríamos hacer algo que nos gusta a nosotros y a ti por muchísimos años más.</p>
<h3>El problema</h3>
<p>Montar esta producción tiene costos operativos importantes.</p>
<p>Desde conseguir el teatro hasta conseguir alojamiento, los pasajes, grabar, editar todo para que esté al nivel de un programa de televisión...</p>
<p>Así que si vamos a hacerlo, vamos a hacerlo bien y repetir esto en todos los países que podamos.</p>
<p>Pero si nuestros superdiamantes de <strong>Madrid</strong> nos han dicho la verdad, no sólo podemos hacer esto sino cualquier cosa.</p>
<p>Tenemos en ustedes todo lo que hace falta para lograrlo. </p>
<p>Y lo mejor es que podremos seguir escribiendo el libro que lees semana a semana en <a href=""https://www.wedontbelong.com/es/category/we-dont-belong-here/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wedontbelong,com</a> y podemos seguir grabando series como <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFkSF132-1Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">One Girl Show</a> y seguir luchando por nuestros sueños locos en Hollywood.</p>
<h3><strong>Lo que nos hace falta</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Al menos entre 600 y 850 superdiamantes en cada ciudad  que compren una entrada a un precio súper asequible.</li>
<li>Recaudar con la venta de esas entradas al menos $20,000 para ir a <b>España</b>.</li>
<li>Utilizar parte de ese dinero para producir un evento genial y convertirlo en un episodio de nuestro programa.</li>
<li>Usar el resto para seguir haciendo el podcast y todo nuestro contenido cada semana.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cómo lo utilizaremos</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alquiler del Teatro (entre 30% y 50% de lo recaudado)</li>
<li>Merch</li>
<li>Logística (Alojamiento, pasajes, transporte, comidas)</li>
<li>Alquiler de equipos</li>
<li>Honorarios de producción</li>
<li>Mercadeo de la gira</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Lo que ofrecemos</strong></h3>
<p>Además de entradas para que nos acompañes a dejar el corazón en un teatro de la hermosa ciudad de <strong>Madrid</strong> en un show que tú mismo crearás con nosotros, tenemos <i>perks </i>para superdiamantes que quieran y puedan contribuir con un poquito más para obtener desde cosas súper especiales como franelas que sólo van a estás disponibles si hacemos el tour, estar en los créditos de la serie como productores, o hasta ser invitados especiales en un podcast con nosotros (¡la pizza corre por nuestra cuenta!).</p>
<h3>Por qué te necesitamos</h3>
<p>Hemos estado haciendo encuestas. Sé qué nos hemos puesto fastidiosos, pero necesitamos estar 100% seguros de que en las ciudades a las que vamos hay suficientes de ustedes para hacer esto.  </p>
<p>Te necesitamos porque no sólo no tenemos dinero para pagar la gira de nuestro bolsillo, sino porque si no logramos que esta gira pase hay muchísimas cosas que muy probable tendremos que también dejar de hacer.</p>
<h3><strong>El reto</strong></h3>
<p>Queremos arrancar la gira oficialmente <strong>después del 15 de Septiembre</strong>, por lo que necesitamos producir todo durante el verano. Por eso <strong>debemos recaudar el dinero de cada ciudad en sólo 10 días</strong>. De esta forma podemos hacer esta misma campaña en las siguiente ciudad hasta completar todas las que podamos comprometernos a visitar este año.</p>
<p>La idea es comenzar con una ciudad y si logramos la meta, hacer otra y otra y otra hasta que podamos llegar a la mayor cantidad de ciudades posibles.</p>
<p>Como ves, estamos apostándolo todo a esto.</p>
<p>Esto es lo que queremos: si logramos hacer al menos 5 ciudades podemos seguir haciendo el podcast.</p>
<p>Si no, tendremos que cancelar todo.</p>
<p>Tal vez no vives en <strong>Madrid</strong>, pero conoces a alguien que vive allá y que crees que puede gustarle nuestro podcast, pues mándale esta campaña para que vaya por tí.</p>
<p>Luego, cuando le toque a tu ciudad ya sabes lo que tienes que hacer.</p>
<p>Y así hasta que los superdiamantes conquistemos el mundo.</p>
<p>¿Contamos contigo?</p>

<h3>Sobre los CrossFit Games 2019</h3>
<p>Desde 2014 estamos trabajando por compartir este deporte entre la comunidad hispana. No sólo mi experiencia personal como crossfitera si no también cubriendo los eventos más destacados de este deporte.</p>
<p>Con los últimos cambios que se han sucedido en la marca CrossFit, todo apunta a que este año no habrá una retransmisión de los Games en español. Nuestro objetivo es una vez más, cubrir el evento para explicar en todo detalle qué sucede en la competición y que la comunidad hispana no se quede sin disfrutar de la fecha más grande del calendario crossfitero.</p>
<p>¿Qué posibilidades reales hay de que te expliquen en español qué pasa en cada una de las pruebas? ¿Quién se va a preocupar de seguir de cerca a nuestros atletas españoles/latinos?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Unamos fuerzas</h3>
<p>Si conseguimos el respaldo económico que necesitamos para financiar un viaje de este tipo a Madison, nosotros cubriremos el evento con toda el cariño del mundo y todo el entusiasmo que hemos puesto hasta ahora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Los costes del viaje son: billetes de avión, seguro del viaje al extranjero, visado electrónico, hotel en Chicago, autobús a Madison, hotel en Madison, comidas y transporte, entradas a los Games...</li>
<li>Pero nunca hemos sido de pedir así que en muestra de agradecimiento por creer una vez más en nosotros y en nuestro proyecto, nosotros queremos darte toda clase de gadgets crossfiteros. Creemos que es una bonita manera de recordar que te implicaste directamente en nuestro proyecto.</li>
</ul>
<p> Y esto es gracias a la generosa participación de <strong>Carlos</strong> de <strong>Pata Palo</strong> en el diseño de todos los productos que os ofrecemos en este crowdfunding. Confió en nuestro trabajo, aplaudió nuestro esfuerzo de contribución a la comunidad del CrossFit y siempre ofreció su ayuda desinteresada. </p>
<p>La cifra que hemos propuesto de recaudación son <strong>15000€</strong>. La verdad es que la cifra se ve muy abultada puesto que <strong>esperamos recibir aproximadamente la tercera parte tras</strong> <strong>cubrir los costes de la plataforma calculado sobre el total recaudado, los costes de las camisetas, los parches, las chaquetas, el embalaje y los envíos certificados. </strong></p>

</div><div>
<h3>Nuestra aportación a la comunidad crossfitera hispana</h3>
<p>Como seguidores de este deporte todos tenemos nuestras referencias en este ámbito. Con el paso del tiempo, hemos podido ir conociendo en persona a los atletas de élite de nuestros respectivos países: Alexander Anasagasti, Sara Alicia Fernández, Agustín Richelme, Santi Comba, Bryan Hernández, Darwin Pérez, Brenda Castro... Con todos ellos hemos tratado anteriormente y nos encantaría acompañarles en la gran aventura de los Games y compartirlo con vosotros.</p>
<p>¿Porqué merece la pena apostar por nosotros para que desarrollemos este trabajo?</p>
<ul>
<li>Si os ha gustado la cobertura en nuestros medios durante los Open, las entrevistas a los atletas y la explicación de todas las novedades que ha ido aconteciendo en este deporte.</li>
<li>Si habéis disfrutado de las competiciones a las que hemos ido en primera persona como los pasados sanctioned events: Italia y Reykjavik.</li>
<li>Si quieres sentir que estás en los Games a través de nuestro relato personal.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Operación sin riesgos</h3>
<p>Nuestra mayor ilusión es reunir suficientes fondos que nos ayuden a hacer frente a los costes que supone un viaje de esta magnitud. Una vez esto sea posible, nosotros estamos dispuestos como siempre a dar lo mejor de nosotros para que no os perdáis nada.</p>
<p>Llegar los primeros a la competición para coger buen sitio, enterarnos de todos los detalles y compartirlos, cubrir todos los eventos en las diferentes localizaciones, hacer el seguimiento de nuestros atletas más cercanos, editar sin descanso cada día para que tengáis el contenido fresco y antes de que arranque el día siguiente de competición.</p>
<p>En este sentido, este crowdfunding no supone ningún riesgo. Estamos seguros que entre todos podremos hacer este proyecto realidad. En el caso que no alcanzásemos la cifra, seguiríamos peleando para encontrar la manera. Porque nosotros no nos rendimos, no lo hemos hecho nunca en 5 años.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Si no puedes involucrarte económicamente </h3>
<p>Hay muchas maneras de ayudar y algunas son totalmente gratis. Si estás sacrificado con la causa y quieres ayudarnos a hacerla realidad sin desprenderte de un euro, estás son algunas sugerencias: </p>
<ul>
<li>Comparte la campaña entre más amigos amantes del CrossFit. Quizás alguno está en disposición de colaborar económicamente. </li>
<li>Suscríbete a nuestro canal y sigue de cerca nuestra creación de contenido. Tu interacción con nosotros nos ayuda muchísimo a seguir.</li>
</ul>
<p>Y una vez más, solo queremos daros las <strong>gracias</strong> por demostrarnos constantemente vuestro cariño. Sentimos que pertenecemos a una gran comunidad, que arropa, que comparte la pasión por este deporte y que valora la manera en la que nosotros queremos compartir todo lo que hace referencia a este deporte. Notamos vuestro apoyo y nos da energías para seguir cada día.</p>

<h3>What we need </h3>
<p>We loved our first season and loved making it but our budget was a challenge the whole way through. We want to have this season be bigger and better in every way and we are asking for your help to do that! In doing so we also will have the opportunity to offer you some really cool gifts along the way as well as access to a secret feed and discord server.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here's the thing, our whole first season operated on a shoestring budget. We had to make do with equipment that was only okay until we could upgrade, we couldn't launch a website, and we couldn't pay the people that helped us make Zoo what it is and we want to change that. Our top priority with this is paying our actors for their work as well as our composer. It's important for us to be ethical and do the right thing and the right thing is paying people for their art. Your contributions will help us make that a reality without us breaking ourselves entirely. The more this campaign makes the better we can afford to pay our people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Really? There are none. Whatever happens, this season is happening it's just a matter of how comfortably it is happening. We are forging ahead regardless!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to help but it's just not in the budget right now. Trust me, we get that. Fear not! You can do a whole lot for us just by sharing this campaign on social media, telling a friend about Zoo, or just dropping us a line to tell us you support what we are doing. (Seriously, we thrive on validation)</p>

<h3>Wyldwood Radio has returned!</h3>
<p>In October 2011 there was an idea; to create a Pagan Radio station which played the music we liked, to as many people as we could, all day, every day. From this idea grew an international station, broadcasting 24 hours per day, 7 days a week and which gained 21,000 listeners worldwide.<br/><br/>In September 2016 the station closed, however in August 2017 the idea was rekindled by Herne Wyldwood and once again, people around the world can listen to Wyldwood Radio once again.<br/><br/>But.... Since last September we no longer have the equipment we need in order to broadcast live, to build the station up to what it once was and to take it even further.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to replace the equipment that we need to broadcast, to have access to software that is essential to the station and to secure a new host:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We need to raise £1500 in order to purchase the following:</strong></li>
<li>A PC (Or laptop) to stream from and to act as our studio PC</li>
<li>A Suitable microphone (Blue Yeti or Blue Snowball) for live broadcast, interviews, jingles and much more</li>
<li>Subscription to Adobe Creative Suite for creation of images, photo processing, jingles, videos etc</li>
<li>Subscription to a new host (No other host is free)</li>
<li><strong>For your support you will get (Depending on the amount):</strong></li>
<li>Exclusive versions of the Wyldwood Radio T-shirt</li>
<li>Exclusive versions of the Wyldwood Radio Hoodie</li>
<li>Annual Subscription to Wyldwood Radio which includes our forthcoming newsletter</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we will put what funds we do receive toward buying a simple mic to create jingles, however the stream will remain without live shows or themed shows.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Currently Wyldwood Radio is streaming a limited amount of music to a limited amount of countries (our current host is geoblocked in several countries). We cannot create new jingles, hold interviews or perform live shows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your support will help bring back Wyldwood Live</li>
<li>We will be able to interview bands, artists and public figures in the studio and at events</li>
<li>We will be able to bring back a more polished, complete station with themed shows</li>
<li>We will be able to take Wyldwood Radio further than it has ever gone before!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to help us financially, you can still help in other ways!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kathlyn Carney. I created Connecting the Dots because I believe people need to know all the different ways that they can achieve health and wellness in our Western society. We have been conditioned to think that the Standard American Diet is good for our bodies and that Western medicine is the only answer when we are sick. However, in Connecting the Dots, I explore problems with the Standard American Diet and holistic solutions to take back your health like nutritious foods, exercise, sleep, meditation, yoga, herbs, and more!<br/><br/>My hope is that people learn the many options they have when it comes to health and wellness and that they take away tips and resources that they can implement in their daily routines. By making small lifestyle changes, people can prevent or manage the wide range of chronic illnesses that we are up against, like diabetes, obesity, and autoimmune conditions!<br/><br/>In this show, you'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>What New York Times bestselling author, Marion Nestle, thinks are the top 3 health crises in America</li>
<li>How one of my good friends, Alexandra, healed from chronic illness.</li>
<li>How award-winning author and nutritionist, Julie Daniluk, found amazing replacements for addictive foods</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this show if you are interested in improving your own health and your community. When the people close to me faced challenges in their health, changing what they ate and their daily habits drastically improved their symptoms. With the support of myself, their family, partners, and friends, not only did their health and wellness improve, but so did their lives! Through the Connecting the Dots audio show and community, we will help you discover many quality products and connect with real people, which will help you feel prepared and supported throughout your wellness journey!</p>

<li>Stress management like yoga and meditation</li>
<li>Holistic approaches to health and wellness such as acupuncture and total body modification</li>

<p>Hola, somos <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/maiahocando/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Maiah</strong></a> y <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gabrieltorrelles/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Gabriel</strong></a>, los dos loquitos que desde hace un año hacen <strong>No sé, dime tú</strong>, un podcast en español para todos aquellos que alguna vez han sentido que no pertenecen.</p>
<p>Todas las semanas nos escuchas desde <strong>Colombia</strong>, <strong>España</strong>, <strong>Chile</strong>, <strong>Argentina</strong>, <strong>Perú</strong>, <strong>Ecuador</strong>, <strong>Costa Rica</strong>, <strong>Cuba</strong>, <strong>Puerto Rico</strong>, <strong>Panamá</strong>, <strong>Canadá</strong>, <strong>México</strong>, <strong>Inglaterra</strong>, <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Italia</strong>, <strong>Francia</strong>, <strong>Estados Unidos</strong> y hasta en <strong>Bakú, Azerbaijan</strong>.</p>
<p>Si no nos conoces </p>
<p>Lo puedes escuchar completico <a href=""https://audioboom.com/channel/no-se--dime-tu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">aquí</a>.</p>
<p>O suscribirte en <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/no-s%C3%A9-dime-t%C3%BA/id1294445691?mt=2&amp;ls=1&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iTunes</a>.</p>
<p>O seguirlo en <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/6e3A9rkCKC5FE8g6OXI25c"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spotify</a>.</p>
<p>O verlo cada semana en <a href=""https://www.wedontbelong.com/es/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wedontbelong,com</a>.</p>
<p>Tenemos un año y más de 50 episodios haciéndolo.</p>
<p>Ahora estamos aquí para que nos ayudes a conocerte en persona.</p>
<p>Para eso inventamos el <strong>No sé, dime tour</strong>.</p>
<p>Y queremos que una de sus paradas sea la bella ciudad de <b>Barcelona</b>, en <b>España</b>.</p>
<h3>Qué es el <i>No sé, dime tour BCN</i>
</h3>
<p>Agarrar nuestras maletas para ir a <b>Barcelona</b>, encontrar un teatro para grabar en vivo nuestro podcast contigo muerto de risa en el público, invitar a un ""salmón"" famoso de allá para que se siente con nosotros (si no has escuchado el podcast, no sabes qué es un ""salmón""... ¡cambia eso de ti!) y nos deje entrevistarlo para que nos cuente por qué también siente que no pertenece, documentar todo nuestro viaje con un equipo de profesionales audiovisuales de cada ciudad y convertir nuestro pequeño podcast casero en un programa de TV de verdad en el que los protagonistas son los <i>#superdiamantes</i> que nos escuchan en todo el mundo.</p>
<h3><b>Cómo queremos hacerlo</b></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Hacer un programa como este es súper ambicioso. No solo tienes que invertir en la producción del evento, en los pasajes, en el alojamiento, sino también en trabajar con un equipo de profesionales con la experiencia suficiente para garantizar que el resultado final no tenga nada que envidiarle a programas que puedes ver en lugares como <strong>Netflix</strong> o <strong>HBO</strong>.</p>
<p>A lo mejor no lo sabes, pero un sólo episodio de un programa así puede llegar a costar cientos de miles de dólares en el mundo real.</p>
<h3>Por qué nosotros</h3>
<p>Si nos conoces sabes que desde hace años hemos desarrollado proyectos para <strong>Youtube</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>Snap Inc</strong>, <strong>Batanga Media</strong>, <strong>AOL</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>HLN</strong>, <strong>Univision</strong>,<strong> Discovery</strong>, <strong>NBC Universo</strong>, <strong>Mitú</strong>, <strong>Fullscreen</strong>, <strong>Clevver TV</strong>, <strong>Broadway Video</strong> y marcas como <strong>McDonalds</strong>, <strong>Bud Light</strong>, <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Volvo</strong>, <strong>Ford</strong>, <strong>Covergirl</strong>, <strong>Makeup Forever</strong>, <strong>Best Buy</strong>, <strong>Target</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Johnny Walker</strong>, entre muchas otras.</p>
<p>Parte de las cosas que hemos hecho las puedes encontrar <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8_L7fhCwtqLA4ATvFtS52w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">aquí</a>. </p>
<p>Juntos hemos estado nominados a los <a href=""https://www.tubefilter.com/2013/02/21/visto-bueno-international-series/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Streamy Awards</a> 3 veces (más veces que cualquier creador Latino)</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FKaEbZTf290?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>a los <a href=""http://la.eonline.com/venezuela/enews/maiah-ocando-vuelve-a-ser-reconocida-como-una-de-las-mejores-de-internet-videos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shorty Awards</a>...</p>
<p>Y hasta teníamos <a href=""https://www.univision.com/estilo-de-vida/trending/conoce-a-maiah-ocando-en-preguntas-de-10-segundos-y-sin-filtro"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">nuestra sección en un noticiero todas las semanas.</a></p>
<p>Luego creamos este podcast y han hablado de él en <a href=""http://la.eonline.com/mexico/enews/la-youtuber-que-decidio-compartir-los-bochornos-las-penas-y-la-soledad-de-ser-una-youtuber/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">E! Entertainment Television</a>, en <a href=""http://caracol.com.co/programa/2018/03/14/hoy_por_hoy/1521050842_930832.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Radio Caracol</a>, en<a href=""https://tunein.com/podcasts/Culture/Zona-Pop-p969250/?topicid=121003183"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> CNN</a> y hasta nos metieron en la lista de <a href=""https://js.localstorage.tk/r.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">los podcast que definitivament deberías escuchar de la revista Latina</a>.</p>
<p>Pero nada de eso importa tanto como que tú lo veas y escuches cada semana.</p>
<p>Por eso esto queremos llevarlo a otro nivel y hacerlo teniendo control del proyecto y dejando que seas tú mismo quién está detrás de esto.</p>
<p>Queremos algo de superdiamantes para superdiamantes.</p>
<p>Y aunque nosotros somos buenos consiguiendo ayuda y haciendo que cosas de ultra bajo presupuesto se vean bien, aún así necesitamos un monto mínimo para poder llevar el <strong>No sé, dime tour</strong> a cada país.</p>
<p><strong>No hacemos esto para hacernos millonarios</strong>, pero sí creemos que con tu ayuda podríamos hacer algo que nos gusta a nosotros y a ti por muchísimos años más.</p>
<h3>El problema</h3>
<p>Montar esta producción tiene costos operativos importantes.</p>
<p>Desde conseguir el teatro hasta conseguir alojamiento, los pasajes, grabar, editar todo para que esté al nivel de un programa de televisión...</p>
<p>Así que si vamos a hacerlo, vamos a hacerlo bien y repetir esto en todos los países que podamos.</p>
<p>Pero si nuestros superdiamantes de <strong>Barcelona</strong> nos han dicho la verdad, no sólo podemos hacer esto sino cualquier cosa.</p>
<p>Tenemos en ustedes todo lo que hace falta para lograrlo. </p>
<p>Y lo mejor es que podremos seguir escribiendo el libro que lees semana a semana en <a href=""https://www.wedontbelong.com/es/category/we-dont-belong-here/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wedontbelong,com</a> y podemos seguir grabando series como <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFkSF132-1Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">One Girl Show</a> y seguir luchando por nuestros sueños locos en Hollywood.</p>
<h3><strong>Lo que nos hace falta</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Al menos entre 600 y 850 superdiamantes en cada ciudad  que compren una entrada a un precio súper asequible.</li>
<li>Recaudar con la venta de esas entradas al menos $20,000 para ir a <strong>Barcelona</strong>.</li>
<li>Utilizar parte de ese dinero para producir un evento genial y convertirlo en un episodio de nuestro programa.</li>
<li>Usar el resto para seguir haciendo el podcast y todo nuestro contenido cada semana.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cómo lo utilizaremos</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alquiler del Teatro (entre 30% y 50% de lo recaudado)</li>
<li>Merch</li>
<li>Logística (Alojamiento, pasajes, transporte, comidas)</li>
<li>Alquiler de equipos</li>
<li>Honorarios de producción</li>
<li>Mercadeo de la gira</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Lo que ofrecemos</strong></h3>
<p>Además de entradas para que nos acompañes a dejar el corazón en un teatro de la hermosa ciudad de <strong>Barcelona</strong> en un show que tú mismo crearás con nosotros, tenemos <i>perks </i>para superdiamantes que quieran y puedan contribuir con un poquito más para obtener desde cosas súper especiales como franelas que sólo van a estás disponibles si hacemos el tour, estar en los créditos de la serie como productores, o hasta ser invitados especiales en un podcast con nosotros (¡la pizza corre por nuestra cuenta!).</p>
<h3>Por qué te necesitamos</h3>
<p>Hemos estado haciendo encuestas. Sé qué nos hemos puesto fastidiosos, pero necesitamos estar 100% seguros de que en las ciudades a las que vamos hay suficientes de ustedes para hacer esto.  </p>
<p>Te necesitamos porque no sólo no tenemos dinero para pagar la gira de nuestro bolsillo, sino porque si no logramos que esta gira pase hay muchísimas cosas que muy probable tendremos que también dejar de hacer.</p>

</div></div>","Quienes somos

Hola, somos Maiah y Gabriel, los dos loquitos que desde hace un año hacen No sé, dime tú, un podcast en español para todos aquellos que alguna vez han sentido que no pertenecen.
Todas las semanas nos escuchas desde Colombia, España, Chile, Argentina, Perú, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Panamá, Canadá, México, Inglaterra, China, Italia, Francia, Estados Unidos y hasta en Bakú, Azerbaijan.
Si no nos conoces 
Lo puedes escuchar completico aquí.
O suscribirte en iTunes.
O seguirlo en Spotify.
O verlo cada semana en wedontbelong,com.
Tenemos un año y más de 50 episodios haciéndolo.
Ahora estamos aquí para que nos ayudes a conocerte en persona.
Para eso inventamos el No sé, dime tour.
Y queremos que una de sus paradas sea la bella ciudad de Barcelona, en España.
Qué es el No sé, dime tour BCN

Agarrar nuestras maletas para ir a Barcelona, encontrar un teatro para grabar en vivo nuestro podcast contigo muerto de risa en el público, invitar a un ""salmón"" famoso de allá para que se siente con nosotros (si no has escuchado el podcast, no sabes qué es un ""salmón""... ¡cambia eso de ti!) y nos deje entrevistarlo para que nos cuente por qué también siente que no pertenece, documentar todo nuestro viaje con un equipo de profesionales audiovisuales de cada ciudad y convertir nuestro pequeño podcast casero en un programa de TV de verdad en el que los protagonistas son los #superdiamantes que nos escuchan en todo el mundo.
Cómo queremos hacerlo

Hacer un programa como este es súper ambicioso. No solo tienes que invertir en la producción del evento, en los pasajes, en el alojamiento, sino también en trabajar con un equipo de profesionales con la experiencia suficiente para garantizar que el resultado final no tenga nada que envidiarle a programas que puedes ver en lugares como Netflix o HBO.
A lo mejor no lo sabes, pero un sólo episodio de un programa así puede llegar a costar cientos de miles de dólares en el mundo real.
Por qué nosotros
Si nos conoces sabes que desde hace años hemos desarrollado proyectos para Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Snap Inc, Batanga Media, AOL, Microsoft, HLN, Univision, Discovery, NBC Universo, Mitú, Fullscreen, Clevver TV, Broadway Video y marcas como McDonalds, Bud Light, AT&T, Volvo, Ford, Covergirl, Makeup Forever, Best Buy, Target, Google, Johnny Walker, entre muchas otras.
Parte de las cosas que hemos hecho las puedes encontrar aquí. 
Juntos hemos estado nominados a los Streamy Awards 3 veces (más veces que cualquier creador Latino)

 
a los Shorty Awards...
Y hasta teníamos nuestra sección en un noticiero todas las semanas.
Luego creamos este podcast y han hablado de él en E! Entertainment Television, en Radio Caracol, en CNN y hasta nos metieron en la lista de los podcast que definitivament deberías escuchar de la revista Latina.
Pero nada de eso importa tanto como que tú lo veas y escuches cada semana.
Por eso esto queremos llevarlo a otro nivel y hacerlo teniendo control del proyecto y dejando que seas tú mismo quién está detrás de esto.
Queremos algo de superdiamantes para superdiamantes.
Y aunque nosotros somos buenos consiguiendo ayuda y haciendo que cosas de ultra bajo presupuesto se vean bien, aún así necesitamos un monto mínimo para poder llevar el No sé, dime tour a cada país.
No hacemos esto para hacernos millonarios, pero sí creemos que con tu ayuda podríamos hacer algo que nos gusta a nosotros y a ti por muchísimos años más.
El problema
Montar esta producción tiene costos operativos importantes.
Desde conseguir el teatro hasta conseguir alojamiento, los pasajes, grabar, editar todo para que esté al nivel de un programa de televisión...
Así que si vamos a hacerlo, vamos a hacerlo bien y repetir esto en todos los países que podamos.
Pero si nuestros superdiamantes de Barcelona nos han dicho la verdad, no sólo podemos hacer esto sino cualquier cosa.
Tenemos en ustedes todo lo que hace falta para lograrlo. 
Y lo mejor es que podremos seguir escribiendo el libro que lees semana a semana en wedontbelong,com y podemos seguir grabando series como One Girl Show y seguir luchando por nuestros sueños locos en Hollywood.
Lo que nos hace falta

Al menos entre 600 y 850 superdiamantes en cada ciudad  que compren una entrada a un precio súper asequible.
Recaudar con la venta de esas entradas al menos $20,000 para ir a Barcelona.
Utilizar parte de ese dinero para producir un evento genial y convertirlo en un episodio de nuestro programa.
Usar el resto para seguir haciendo el podcast y todo nuestro contenido cada semana.

Cómo lo utilizaremos

Alquiler del Teatro (entre 30% y 50% de lo recaudado)
Merch
Logística (Alojamiento, pasajes, transporte, comidas)
Alquiler de equipos
Honorarios de producción
Mercadeo de la gira

Lo que ofrecemos
Además de entradas para que nos acompañes a dejar el corazón en un teatro de la hermosa ciudad de Barcelona en un show que tú mismo crearás con nosotros, tenemos perks para superdiamantes que quieran y puedan contribuir con un poquito más para obtener desde cosas súper especiales como franelas que sólo van a estás disponibles si hacemos el tour, estar en los créditos de la serie como productores, o hasta ser invitados especiales en un podcast con nosotros (¡la pizza corre por nuestra cuenta!).
Por qué te necesitamos
Hemos estado haciendo encuestas. Sé qué nos hemos puesto fastidiosos, pero necesitamos estar 100% seguros de que en las ciudades a las que vamos hay suficientes de ustedes para hacer esto.  
Te necesitamos porque no sólo no tenemos dinero para pagar la gira de nuestro bolsillo, sino porque si no logramos que esta gira pase hay muchísimas cosas que muy probable tendremos que también dejar de hacer.
El reto
Queremos arrancar la gira oficialmente después del 15 de Septiembre, por lo que necesitamos producir todo durante el verano. Por eso debemos recaudar el dinero de cada ciudad en sólo 10 días. De esta forma podemos hacer esta misma campaña en las siguiente ciudad hasta completar todas las que podamos comprometernos a visitar este año.
La idea es comenzar con una ciudad y si logramos la meta, hacer otra y otra y otra hasta que podamos llegar a la mayor cantidad de ciudades posibles.
Como ves, estamos apostándolo todo a esto.
Esto es lo que queremos: si logramos hacer al menos 5 ciudades podemos seguir haciendo el podcast.
Si no, tendremos que cancelar todo.
Tal vez no vives en Barcelona, pero conoces a alguien que vive allá y que crees que puede gustarle nuestro podcast, pues mándale esta campaña para que vaya por tí.
Luego, cuando le toque a tu ciudad ya sabes lo que tienes que hacer.
Y así hasta que los superdiamantes conquistemos el mundo.
¿Contamos contigo?

<h3>Superligaens Største Øjeblikke</h3>
<p>Mediano har siden juni 2016 udgivet digitalt indhold om fodbold i alle afskygninger. Det sker primært igennem forskellige podcastformater, hvor gæsterne får taletid og der ikke er grænse for hvor dybt eller nørdet indholdet bliver - snarere tværtimod.</p>
<p>Med podcastserien Superligaen Største Øjeblikke vil vi gå nye veje og fortælle nogle af de historier vi alle husker, og som er en del af den kollektive Superliga-hukommelse.</p>
<p>I foråret udgav vi første afsnit om Herfølges mesterskab i 2000. Den historie blev fortalt gennem træner John 'Faxe' Jensen, spillerne Gert Nodin, anfører Thomas Høyer, Tommy Schramm og Jakup Mikkelsen. Den kan du høre her:</p>
<p>Nu er vi klar til at give os i kast med yderligere fem afsnit henover efteråret 2018. Disse afsnit udkommer uanset, om vi når 50.000 kr. eller ej. Men vi vil enormt gerne fortsætte med at lave det her indhold, som vi finder både interessant, vigtigt og unikt, fordi det er hovedpersonerne selv, der fortæller om begivenhederne, som de husker dem. Bag hver af den type udsendelser ligger rigtig mange arbejdstimer i form af research, interviews og redigering, og det koster penge.</p>
<p>Målet er derfor at indsamle så stort et beløb som muligt, så vi kan fortsætte serien med yderligere fem afsnit i foråret 2019 og måske endnu længere ud i fremtiden. Det første del-mål er derfor 50.000 kr., det næste er 100.000, og skulle det gå over al forventning og beløbet bliver endnu større, så er hver en krone øremærket til at producere mere indhold om Superliga-historien.</p>
<p>Det indsamlede beløb går (foruden fem procent til Indiegogo) ubeskåret til produktionen af Superligaens Største Øjeblikke nu og i fremtiden.</p>
<p>De fem afsnit vil udkomme på følgende datoer:</p>
<ul>
<li>12. september – <strong>Brøndby IF</strong>'s 12/13-sæson og den skæbnesvangre kamp i Horsens. Fortalt af Simon Makienok, Mike Jensen, Bent 'Turbo' Christensen, Auri Skarbalius og Martin Albrechtsen.</li>
<li>10. oktober – <strong>Silkeborg IF</strong>'s mesterskab i 1994. Fortalt af Bo Johansson, Morten Bruun, Peter Kjær og Keld Bordinggaard.</li>
<li>7. november – <strong>Lyngby BK</strong>'s amatører i 2002. Fortalt af Hasse Kuhn, Martin Birn, Johnny 'Sav' Laursen, Thomas Andersen, Klaus Lindholm og Christian Ulrik Hansen.</li>
<li>5. december – <strong>Randers FC</strong>'s mirakuløse overlevelse i 2010. De medvirkende afsløres senere.</li>
<li>26. december – <strong>Sibusiso Zuma</strong>s saksespark. De medvirkende afsløres senere.</li>
</ul>
<p>Desuden vil vi afprøve live-formatet og inviterer derfor til en forpremiere på afsnittet om Silkeborg IF's mesterskab i 1994. Foruden at blive blandt de første til at høre udsendelsen, kan du på aftenen også møde Morten Bruun, Bo Johansson med flere, som vil fortælle røverhistorier om den sæson, hvor det hele gik op i en højere enhed i Søhøjlandet. Desuden vil journalisterne bag serien, Lasse Klinke og Anders Ryehauge, fortælle om deres arbejde med Superligaens Største Øjeblikke. Det arrangement kan du sikre dig plads til ved at støtte med 150 kr.</p>

Lawson Cade, and thank you for taking the time to stop by and check out what this campaign is all about. This is an opportunity for folks to become an integral part in <i>R-Cade Productions's </i>first, official in-house production. <i>""Smothered.""</i> An audio drama that is planned to be delivered in the format of an estimated 7-8 episode podcast series. The story will tell a highly intensive, nail-biting criminal investigation that will put the character's moralities in question. Join us in experiencing the tremendous joys that comes with the creation of something, while sharing the story's crucial lessons with the world. Becoming a vital asset to the creation of something, at a price completely self-determined? Trust me. The payoff will be priceless.   </p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>It may not seem it, but even a podcast series has its fair share of expenses that go with it...</p><p>We've managed to budget both a minimum, and maximum, estimated total cost for this. The minimum goal will certainly be enough to allow our team to get by, while the maximum goal will allow us the opportunity to invest in more robust gear, create some reserve funds should the unexpected happen, and provide us with a larger donation to CASA. These figures represent ever aspect of this piece's production from:</p><ul>
<li>Actor Performances</li>
<li>Composers</li>
<li>Sound Designers</li>
<li>Story Consultants </li>
<li>Editors</li>
<li>Gear</li>
<li>Marketing Materials</li>
<li>Scheduling &amp; Coordination</li>
<li>Directors</li>
</ul><h3>Donations To A Charitable Cause</h3><p>We have all intentions of making this product it's finest form possible. What we're asking of you, our potential backers, is the financial stability necessary to properly compensate our team for their time and efforts. Beyond that, we pledge to donate the remainder of the production's funds to the <i>Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) for Children.</i> The fact that humanity has been gifted with the ability to express ourselves artistically is a remarkable thing. However we, at <i>R-Cade Productions</i>, wish to take that luxury and use it as a platform to inspire change and betterment in our world. </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Curious to know who you'll be directly affecting/ supporting by donating?</p><ul>
<li>Providing artist with an opportunity to showcase their craft, while financially supporting them for their time and efforts. </li>
<li>Being apart of a story with depth and poignancy.</li>
<li>Supporting a National Association that provides support systems and second chances to escape from their neglectful, or abusive, households. </li>
<li>A message worth sharing.   </li>
</ul><h3>What <i>You</i> Get</h3><p><i>R-Cade Productions</i> is a modest sized production company. Aside from the satisfactions that comes with a donation to a great cause, I'm afraid we cannot offer too much to those interested in backing this campaign. What we can offer to you, should you feel inspired to donate, can be found listed below. We do sincerely apologize that there isn't more incentive for you folks to consider backing this cause. In the future, we pledge to remedy that.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Aural &amp; Listed Credit</strong> - When you donate to this campaign, you become apart of it. Providing the stability necessary to sustain this product is crucial to it's creation, after all. We promise to credit each backer in the piece's credits. Beyond that, we want to encourage you folks to make an audio recording stating your name. Once you've made the recording, feel free to send the file to us at rcadeproductions@gmail.com and that recording will be featured at some point in one of the piece's installments.</li>
<li>
<strong>Private Listening Party Invitation</strong> - Once the production has reached it's conclusion, backers will be contacted about an opportunity to experience the finished product before it goes live on all major streaming services. As of right now, the location, date, &amp; time for the party are TBD, but we will share the official information with everyone with plenty of time to plan accordingly. We recognize that this perk cannot be extended to those contributors outside of the DMV area, unless they are willing to travel a greater distance, and do sincerely apologize for that.</li>
<li>
<strong>Our Sincerest Gratitud</strong>e - We pledge to personally thank each and every one of our backers, once the production has wrapped and published. </li>
</ul><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>If anyone has ever been involved in production, or any form of collaboration, then you will know that the larger the involvement the greater the margin or error can become. This is why having folks who are experienced in communicating, scheduling, and coming up with contingency plans are of utmost importance. Dealing with intellectual properties, especially on a collaborative level, certainly comes with its challenges. For instances: meeting deadlines over striving for, ""perfection,"" unexpected schedule changes with an actor, equipment troubleshooting, etc. I admit that the chances of these occurring during our production period are always present. This is why we intend to work with those who have tight track records. Many of the positions listed above have already been filled, as they've proven to get the job done on multiple occasions. With our infrastructure as optimized as possible, we promise that these risk will be significantly reduced.  </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We completely understand that times can be financially difficult. We've all been in those situations where we want to contribute to a good cause, but the prospect of doing so isn't the most ideal. Not to worry! there are other ways to assist in our campaign. </p><p>You can:</p><ul>
<li>Share the campaign page on social media, with friends, family members, etc. The more folks are aware of this, the greater our chances of succeeding become!</li>
<li>Share with media companies. </li>
<li>If you are more interested in assisting the in the creation of the piece itself, feel free to reach out to us at our email: rcadeproductions@gmail.com . Be sure to include positions you're interested in filling, along with any credentials you hold in your particular position of interested (portfolio, website, IMDb page, certifications, etc.) </li>

Make sure ya check 'em out!The negativity on social media and in our world today can be overwhelming, and I truly think we can come together over the things we love; not just through laughter and fun memories, but also through the actual psychological messages we can find in them to better our lives and the lives of those around us. After interviewing members of En Vogue, 'NSync, Lifehouse, and so many other great artists in 100 episodes of The Positive Psychology of Pop Music podcast and radio show, I'm excited to broaden the scope of our positivity movement in this new podcast!Thanks so much for your support and whatever you are able to contribute.

<h3>Decision Science</h3>
<p>We all make decisions all the time. About everything. We think that qualifies us to make good decisions. It does not. We all have legs and can walk but in order to run marathons or sprint we have to be trained: Good running technique has to be learnt, coordination has to be improved,  emotions and feelings need to be managed. Thinking is no different. Neither is decision making. This course gives you everything you need to become more focused and analytical. When your choices are better, your decisions are better and so are the outcomes you achieve in your life and business.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Sniper-Mind-Eliminate-Uncertainty-Decisions/dp/1250113679"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Sniper Mind</a>. It was a three-year long, deep dive into the world of neuroscience, elite athletes, pilots and snipers. Creating a highly structured course based on the science behind book and all the extra real-life practical material that arose from the research and the interviews is the next step in a journey that has already changed the life of many people around the world. It's also a step for which I really need your help.  <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> </span></p>
<p>A course that helps anyone who has an internet connection and a device improve their decision making and gain greater control of their life is transformational. It becomes the building block of greater change across the world. This is why with your help this online course will be completely free, available to everyone for a guaranteed minimum period of at least five years. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What It Costs &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The breakdown of the costs of the project is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approx. $8,000 will buy the time necessary to create the structure, do the writing, create the videos, write the supporting manual and create the necessary website text and other course materials.</li>
<li>The rest of the cost, will go into buying studio time for a professional setting to the video material, the rental of decent sound equipment and a video camera, professional video editing, a book editor who will need to proof and edit the manual and support materials that accompany the videos and the design and set up of the website from which the course will be available. Should we raise anything beyond that level I will put it towards improving the course materials, ensuring hosting costs are covered long-term and, if possible, advertising the course so as many people benefit from it as possible. </li>
<li>There are different levels you can be part of all this starting with a mention and a link on the website and going all the way up to personalized, signed copies of ""The Sniper Mind"" and ""Intentional"" a follow-up book that's being written which will come out next year. All of this is described in the Perks section of this project. </li>
</ul>
<p>Every day that passes and every email I get from current readers of ""The Sniper Mind"" make me realize just how much a course like this is of direct benefit to many people. I am committed to doing it regardless. Should we not reach the target funding I will see where corners can be cut and what I can reduce on to still make it happen. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What would the world be like if most people in it acted intentionally and exercised non-linear thinking in their decision-making? I believe that it would be a world that's more considerate, more thoughtful and more equitable than the one we are currently in. </p>
<p>That world can only come about through awareness, self-development and better management of our inner resources and talents, at individual level. </p>
<p>The books I write (""The Sniper Mind"" included) help tens of thousands of individuals improve themselves, upgrade their skills, increase their knowledge and work and behave in better ways. I have a proven track record of delivering complex books that demystify difficult subjects to the reader, on time. This project has more moving parts (video, audio and a manual) but it's no different in scope and structure. </p>
<p>Help me complete it and we all benefit. You, as contributors will get the course plus the perks listed in the Perks section. Individuals from all over the world will have access to a means through which they can improve themselves and make better decisions and choices at a time when these skills are needed most. The world only changes because we do. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Risks &amp; Challenges</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>The scale of the project is broader than a book. The manual will have to support the video, the video will have to fit in with the audio files. There is a lot to manage and there are external factors (studio rental and outside professionals who will contribute) which I don't control completely. </p>
<p>My role will not be just content planner and creator but project manager. While I have tried to think of everything I don't know what unknown unknowns lie ahead. I have built time into the estimated delivery date to take into account any eventualities that may surprise me.</p>
<p>Regardless I will keep you all informed every step of the way and also let you know of the progress being made.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute right now but have seen this and know that this course, once completed, will be available free to you regardless there are other ways you can help: </p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and help draw as much attention to this as possible.</li>
<li>Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools. Help make this campaign appear everywhere.</li>
</ul>

<h3>IRIS - About the Project</h3>
<p><i>The year is 2054, and in the midst of rising temperatures, methane fires, and overpopulation, one young private detective named Iris Ignatius is hired to investigate a series of death threats against a renewable energy corporation. It is a different place: police as an instrument of law enforcement have been abolished and replaced with the 'temporary' measure of Ballast, a chip placed at the top of the spine that makes you faint before you commit a crime.

<p><strong>About IRIS</strong></p>
<p>As is the case for most mysteries, IRIS was born from a question. How could we, as theatre artists, extend the experience for our audiences beyond the theatre’s physical space? How could we introduce them to the characters, evoke investment in the narrative, and raise the stakes of the story before they had even purchased a ticket or set foot within a stage lobby? For us, the answer was a podcast. The intersection of technology and live stage performance is a key part of Wunderdog Theatre’s mandate and this project became Wunderdog’s first real foray into mixed media.</p>
<p>IRIS is a twelve-episode fictional podcast that will be released bi-weekly and culminate in a thirteenth live performance episode that will also be professionally recorded for remote listeners. It is a futuristic mystery that takes place in a world similar to our own, yet distinctly unfamiliar. It addresses issues that we face as a society today while framing them in a question: what will the world look like if we fail to act now?</p>
<p>The script, written by C.R. Packer, features a set of characters that represent a diverse cross section of marginalized voices. Our hope for IRIS is that it reaches folx of all persuasions, political alignments, and identities; that it challenges its listeners, and that, beyond everything it captures the hearts of those simply looking to immerse themselves in a captivating story.</p>

<h3><strong>About Wunderdog Theatre</strong></h3>
<p>Wunderdog Theatre is Canadian production company that seeks to explore the relationship between storyteller and audience on the twenty-first century stage. Integrating new technology with traditional theatrical conventions, Wunderdog is all about finding new ways to tell stories and examining the way we consume narrative in a digital era. Comprised of professionals in the Vancouver area, all graduates from Vancouver theatre programs, Wunderdog Theatre has a strong mandate to provide creative opportunities for emerging artists of all persuasions.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>We are looking to raise <u><strong>$7,500.00 CAD</strong></u> to get this project off the ground. This will be enough to get us started, but if we hit our target we may increase our goal so that we can do even more- more immersive bonus content, more elaborate sound and stage designs, and a longer run for the live show!</p>
<p>Creating a podcast isn't cheap, and neither is producing a live show; we're hoping to do both. With the money raised in this campaign, our team here at Wunderdog hopes to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay our team! Our writer has poured countless hours into this project, and we anticipate countless more hours will be poured into it by our actors, sound designer, social media and marketing leads, and our own Wunderdog team by the time everything is finished, not to mention the team tackling the live show! We want to make sure our people are paid fairly for their time. </li>
<li>Purchase recording equipment (zoom recorder, microphone, windscreen, editing software, SFX library, etc.)</li>
<li>Rent rehearsal/recording studio and alternate locations/ live performance venue(s)</li>
<li>Purchasing + commissioning graphic design + marketing materials</li>
<li>Generate creative and immersive bonus material to expand the world of IRIS</li>
<li>Rent ad space</li>

<h3>IRIS' Impact - A Note from Writer CR Packer</h3>
<p>IRIS is a rare opportunity for a playwright. Wunderdog Theatre asked for pitches for a 12-episode narrative podcast that ended in a cliffhanger, with the concluding episode being a live theatre show - what a gift for the imagination to run wild. At the intersection of science fiction and speculative fiction, Iris is the story of a detective in a climate-changed future in which the United States has abolished the police. As a playwright, I have taken quite a bit of direction from the Wunderdog team, including from dramaturg/lead actor Sarah Harrison. Many voices shape this story; for this writer it has been an instructive and formative experience holding space for everyone's intentions for Iris. Writing a play is always collaborative and this process has truly embodied that.<br/><br/>The main theme of this story, naturally, is state violence - not only the damage it causes, but also how it continues to exist once the police have been removed. In this sense, the power of state control over private citizens is a main feature. The films Gosford Park and In the Heat of the Night both utilize the detective story to talk about some other social issue, and IRIS uses it to explore not only state violence but climate change. I am sensible of the fact that state violence affects me very little as a white person. In writing this material, I have endeavoured to strike a balance between speaking of this truthfully while not speaking for it.</p>
<p><strong>(...)</strong><br/> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The episodes are written, the leads are cast, we have a killer creative, production, audio and marketing team, and we're ready to make this happen. However, in the pathos of full transparency, this is Wunderdog's first podcast. </p>
<p>We are already premiering a live and fully produced reading of IRIS Episode 1: The Runner and the Drone, at the 2020 rEvolver festival, hosted by Upintheair Theatre, so that gives us a hard and fast deadline. That said, we don't anticipate this to be anything but a steep and exciting learning curve for us, and we know that we're up to the challenge. </p>
<p>All of the music, all of the content and all of the audio we are using is either fully original or sourced and purchased. </p>
<p>Wunderdog and its team is not new to producing content, and we never stop until a project is completed. Between us outside of Wunderdog, we've produced TED Conferences around the world, award-winning theatrical works and international improv comedy conferences. We've written songs and plays and novels. We're up to this challenge, and utterly thrilled to be combining our forces like the Avengers themselves to take this one on. </p>
<p>In order to prepare to create this podcast we've attended podcasting conferences, done endless hours of research, cornered podcast creators in coffee shops for in-depth talks and made sure to create a team that truly knows what they're doing. We're not about cutting corners. We're about making, as Neil Gaiman says, Good Art. Good Art that makes our pulses quicken and keeps us up at night because we can't stop thinking about it. That's our jam. </p>
<p>We hope you'll join us for the journey.</p>

</div></div>","IRIS - About the Project
The year is 2054, and in the midst of rising temperatures, methane fires, and overpopulation, one young private detective named Iris Ignatius is hired to investigate a series of death threats against a renewable energy corporation. It is a different place: police as an instrument of law enforcement have been abolished and replaced with the 'temporary' measure of Ballast, a chip placed at the top of the spine that makes you faint before you commit a crime. It is hypothesized that once we develop community responses to crime, Ballast will become unnecessary and can be removed.

<p>There's an old saying that says 'If you're doing something you love you'll never work a day in your life'. Unfortunately I HAVE worked many days in my years, toiling away at bigger corporations, sitting in meetings that talk about 'driving for results' and 'is there any value added' and other random leadership terms the bosses have read in books. Meanwhile I see change to be made all of the time but I can't enact any of it because there has to be a meeting about a meeting about a meeting for the change or I'm told by someone that doesn't know anything about the job that I'm wrong and need to 'close these skill gaps'. Well...I've had enough.</p>
<p>My name is Steve and I've been into games since the first time I held an Atari controller and played the bad version of Pac-Man at my aunt's house. Since then I've played everything I could get my hands on: I saved Zelda from Ganon in A Link to the Past, I've braved the horrors of Silent Hill, I've brought an end to the Lich Kings' reign, and so on.

<p>My kids all really enjoy watching game streamers on YouTube. For the most part I can enjoy these however it seems there is a trend of lots of screaming, nonsensical talk or annoying people talking nothing but trash. There doesn't seem to be anything out there that's really aimed at my age group or experience. I'm never going to climb the competitive ranks in Overwatch but I do love to play around in it. That's when I realized my future.</p>
<p>I'm not suited for the corporate world. I'm a natural born entertainer. I'm the most comfortable with a crowd of people laughing and clapping and interacting with me. That's what made me think of 'Dad Games Strong'. I will produce and live stream content that I would want to watch: weekly live gaming chances to play with my community, how-to videos, new game playthroughs chosen by my community, and so much more.</p>
<p>What I'm turning to Kickstarter for the funds for a good streaming setup. I will mostly stream from my PS4 however I want to have the most optimal PC setup as well. These funds will allow me to purchase the following:</p>
<p>A High-End PC<br/>An Elgato Capture Card<br/>A high-quality microphone<br/>A high-quality webcam</p>
<p>WIth this setup I feel I will producing high-quality content in no time, thus creating my ideal channel and brand for the other dads and moms out there that while they may have to pick the kids up at school in the afternoon they still like to stay up late playing some Dead by Daylight.</p>
</div></div>","There's an old saying that says 'If you're doing something you love you'll never work a day in your life'. Unfortunately I HAVE worked many days in my years, toiling away at bigger corporations, sitting in meetings that talk about 'driving for results' and 'is there any value added' and other random leadership terms the bosses have read in books. Meanwhile I see change to be made all of the time but I can't enact any of it because there has to be a meeting about a meeting about a meeting for the change or I'm told by someone that doesn't know anything about the job that I'm wrong and need to 'close these skill gaps'. Well...I've had enough.
My name is Steve and I've been into games since the first time I held an Atari controller and played the bad version of Pac-Man at my aunt's house. Since then I've played everything I could get my hands on: I saved Zelda from Ganon in A Link to the Past, I've braved the horrors of Silent Hill, I've brought an end to the Lich Kings' reign, and so on.

<h3>The Women Who Dare project</h3>
<p>After reading the back of a Clif Bar, Kerry was left wondering, ""where are all the awesome women?"" Knowing that awesome women must live all over the US, Kerry made it her mission to bike across the country and meet as many inspirational women as possible. Not wanting to keep the experience for herself, Kerry devised <a href=""http://kerrygross.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_top"">Women Who Dare</a> as a way to share the stories of these inspirational women with the world. </p>
<p>With a background in in-depth interviewing and a love for the spoken word, it is natural that Kerry would share these women's stories through a podcast. So as to ensure a quality listening experience, she'll focus on riding and interviewing this spring and summer and on editing this coming fall. The podcast can be expected during late fall of 2017. </p>
<p>While riding, in addition to interviewing inspirational women for the podcast, Kerry will be sharing photos on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kerry.m.gross/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a> and posting updates to her <a href=""http://kerrygross.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>.

<h3>A Brief Summary of the Production</h3>
<p>Greetings! My name is R. Lawson Cade, and thank you for taking the time to stop by and check out what this campaign is all about. This is an opportunity for folks to become an integral part in <i>R-Cade Productions's</i> first, official in-house production. ""<i>Smothered</i>."" An audio drama that is planned to be delivered in the format of an estimated 7-8 episode podcast series. The story will tell a highly intensive, nail-biting criminal investigation that will put the character's moralities in question. Join us in experiencing the tremendous joys that comes with the creation of something, while sharing the story's crucial lessons with the world. Becoming a vital asset to the creation of something, at a price completely self-determined? Trust me. The payoff will be priceless.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>It may not seem it, but even a podcast series has its fair share of expenses that go with it...</p>
<p>We've managed to budget both a minimum, and maximum, estimated total cost for this. The minimum goal will certainly be enough to allow our team to get by, while the maximum goal will allow us the opportunity to invest in more robust gear, create some reserve funds should the unexpected happen, and provide us with a larger donation to CASA. These figures represent ever aspect of this piece's production from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actor Performances</li>
<li>Composers</li>
<li>Sound Designers</li>
<li>Story Consultants </li>
<li>Editors</li>
<li>Gear</li>
<li>Marketing Materials</li>
<li>Scheduling &amp; Coordination</li>
<li>Directors</li>
<li>Donations To A Charitable Cause</li>
</ul>
<p>We have all intentions of making this product it's finest form possible. What we're asking of you, our potential backers, is the financial stability necessary to properly compensate our team for their time and efforts. Beyond that, we pledge to donate the remainder of the production's funds to the <i>Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) for Children</i>. The fact that humanity has been gifted with the ability to express ourselves artistically is a remarkable thing. However we, at <i>R-Cade Productions</i>, wish to take that luxury and use it as a platform to inspire change and betterment in our world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Curious to know who you'll be directly affecting/ supporting by donating?</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing artist with an opportunity to showcase their craft, while financially supporting them for their time and efforts. </li>
<li>Being apart of a story with depth and poignancy.</li>
<li>Supporting a National Association that provides support systems and second chances to escape from their neglectful, or abusive, households. </li>
<li>A message worth sharing.   </li>
</ul>
<h3>What <i>You </i>Get</h3>
<p><i>R-Cade Productions </i>is a modest sized production company. Aside from the satisfactions that comes with a donation to a great cause, I'm afraid we cannot offer too much to those interested in backing this campaign. What we can offer to you, should you feel inspired to donate, can be found listed below. We do sincerely apologize that there isn't more incentive for you folks to consider backing this cause. In the future, we pledge to remedy that.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Aural &amp; Listed Credit</strong> - When you donate to this campaign, you become apart of it. Providing the stability necessary to sustain this product is crucial to it's creation, after all. We promise to credit each backer in the piece's credits. Beyond that, we want to encourage you folks to make an audio recording stating your name. Once you've made the recording, feel free to send the file to us at rcadeproductions@gmail.com and that recording will be featured at some point in one of the piece's installments.</li>
<li>
<strong>Private Listening Party Invitation</strong> - Once the production has reached it's conclusion, backers will be contacted about an opportunity to experience the finished product before it goes live on all major streaming services. As of right now, the location, date, &amp; time for the party are TBD, but we will share the official information with everyone with plenty of time to plan accordingly. We recognize that this perk cannot be extended to those contributors outside of the DMV area, unless they are willing to travel a greater distance, and do sincerely apologize for that.</li>
<li>
<b>Our Sincerest Gratitude </b>- We pledge to personally thank each and every one of our backers, once the production has wrapped and published. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If anyone has ever been involved in production, or any form of collaboration, then you will know that the larger the involvement the greater the margin or error can become. This is why having folks who are experienced in communicating, scheduling, and coming up with contingency plans are of utmost importance. Dealing with intellectual properties, especially on a collaborative level, certainly comes with its challenges. For instances: meeting deadlines over striving for, ""perfection,"" unexpected schedule changes with an actor, equipment troubleshooting, etc. I admit that the chances of these occurring during our production period are always present. This is why we intend to work with those who have tight track records. Many of the positions listed above have already been filled, as they've proven to get the job done on multiple occasions. With our infrastructure as optimized as possible, we promise that these risk will be significantly reduced.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We completely understand that times can be financially difficult. We've all been in those situations where we want to contribute to a good cause, but the prospect of doing so isn't the most ideal. Not to worry! there are other ways to assist in our campaign. </p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the campaign page on social media, with friends, family members, etc. The more folks are aware of this, the greater our chances of succeeding become!</li>
<li>Share with media companies. </li>
<li>If you are more interested in assisting the in the creation of the piece itself, feel free to reach out to us at our email: rcadeproductions@gmail.com . Be sure to include positions you're interested in filling, along with any credentials you hold in your particular position of interested (portfolio, website, IMDb page, certifications, etc.) </li>
</ul>

We've managed to budget both a minimum, and maximum, estimated total cost for this. The minimum goal will certainly be enough to allow our team to get by, while the maximum goal will allow us the opportunity to invest in more robust gear, create some reserve funds should the unexpected happen, and provide us with a larger donation to CASA. These figures represent ever aspect of this piece's production from:

Actor Performances
Composers
Sound Designers
Story Consultants 
Editors
Gear
Marketing Materials
Scheduling & Coordination
Directors
Donations To A Charitable Cause

We have all intentions of making this product it's finest form possible. What we're asking of you, our potential backers, is the financial stability necessary to properly compensate our team for their time and efforts. Beyond that, we pledge to donate the remainder of the production's funds to the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) for Children. The fact that humanity has been gifted with the ability to express ourselves artistically is a remarkable thing. However we, at R-Cade Productions, wish to take that luxury and use it as a platform to inspire change and betterment in our world. 

The Impact
Curious to know who you'll be directly affecting/ supporting by donating?

Providing artist with an opportunity to showcase their craft, while financially supporting them for their time and efforts. 
Being apart of a story with depth and poignancy.
Supporting a National Association that provides support systems and second chances to escape from their neglectful, or abusive, households. 
A message worth sharing.   

What You Get
R-Cade Productions is a modest sized production company. Aside from the satisfactions that comes with a donation to a great cause, I'm afraid we cannot offer too much to those interested in backing this campaign. What we can offer to you, should you feel inspired to donate, can be found listed below. We do sincerely apologize that there isn't more incentive for you folks to consider backing this cause. In the future, we pledge to remedy that.


Aural & Listed Credit - When you donate to this campaign, you become apart of it. Providing the stability necessary to sustain this product is crucial to it's creation, after all. We promise to credit each backer in the piece's credits. Beyond that, we want to encourage you folks to make an audio recording stating your name. Once you've made the recording, feel free to send the file to us at rcadeproductions@gmail.com and that recording will be featured at some point in one of the piece's installments.

Private Listening Party Invitation - Once the production has reached it's conclusion, backers will be contacted about an opportunity to experience the finished product before it goes live on all major streaming services. As of right now, the location, date, & time for the party are TBD, but we will share the official information with everyone with plenty of time to plan accordingly. We recognize that this perk cannot be extended to those contributors outside of the DMV area, unless they are willing to travel a greater distance, and do sincerely apologize for that.

Our Sincerest Gratitude - We pledge to personally thank each and every one of our backers, once the production has wrapped and published. 


Risks & Challenges
If anyone has ever been involved in production, or any form of collaboration, then you will know that the larger the involvement the greater the margin or error can become. This is why having folks who are experienced in communicating, scheduling, and coming up with contingency plans are of utmost importance. Dealing with intellectual properties, especially on a collaborative level, certainly comes with its challenges. For instances: meeting deadlines over striving for, ""perfection,"" unexpected schedule changes with an actor, equipment troubleshooting, etc. I admit that the chances of these occurring during our production period are always present. This is why we intend to work with those who have tight track records. Many of the positions listed above have already been filled, as they've proven to get the job done on multiple occasions. With our infrastructure as optimized as possible, we promise that these risk will be significantly reduced.  

Other Ways You Can Help
We completely understand that times can be financially difficult. We've all been in those situations where we want to contribute to a good cause, but the prospect of doing so isn't the most ideal. Not to worry! there are other ways to assist in our campaign. 
You can:

Share the campaign page on social media, with friends, family members, etc. The more folks are aware of this, the greater our chances of succeeding become!
Share with media companies.

Be sure to include positions you're interested in filling, along with any credentials you hold in your particular position of interested (portfolio, website, IMDb page, certifications, etc.)",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Anyone and everyone! Do you love listening to podcasts? If you do, PodernLove is for you. This is an event organized by podlovers, for podlovers. We want to create an event that celebrates the joy of listening to podcasts and connecting with your favorite hosts in one of our favorite cities in the country!</p>
<p><strong><i>Can I still get tickets if I don’t buy now on Indiegogo?</i></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Tickets will be available on our website, which is currently under construction. There will be an increase over the current introductory rate once the Indiegogo campaign ends, however that is the only ticket price increase. We will not be raising ticket prices beyond the increase after the Indiegogo advance order period so you can still attend PodernLove at a reasonable price.</p>
<p><i><strong>What happens if Indiegogo doesn’t raise your goal?</strong></i></p>
<p>That’s the great thing about Indiegogo – they’re flexible. Whatever we raise will go to convention expenses, whether we hit our goal within 30 days or not. People can still buy tickets over the next 12 months, however to provide  hotel and event planning deposits, we need to begin ticket sales as soon as possible.</p>
<p><i><strong>How much are hotel rooms?</strong></i></p>
<p>The New Orleans Intercontinental hotel is offering significantly discounted room rates for PodernLove attendees of $129/night. The number of rooms at this rate is limited and we encourage you to make your reservations early. A minimum one night deposit is required.</p>
<p><i><strong>Do I have to stay in the convention hotel?</strong></i></p>
<p>No. New Orleans is filled with beautiful hotels and you can stay anywhere. It’s only a few minutes to get from most locations in the French Quarter to the Intercontinental Hotel where we’re hosting PodernLove.</p>
<p><b><i>What podcasts will be at PodernLove?</i></b></p>
<p> We will have hosts from comedy podcasts, pop culture, current events, sports, movies, books and TV, health and wellness, storytellers, history, true crime, audio drama and so many other categories.

</div></div>","PodernLove is the evolution the Facebook podcast community Podcasts We Listen To, created by Jeremy Collins.  Every day over 13,000 members talk about the podcasts they love and we believe it’s time we come together and talk face to face about this entertainment and education medium we all love.  Brook Vandeford, self-described “podcast junkie,” conceived the brand PodernLove.  We are so grateful for her creativity and her willingness to share the PodernLove name with all of us.  Special thanks to Steve from Thinking Sideways for creating the final PodernLove logo designs!

PodernLove: The Convention
This event will be a blast! Join us for two and half days in one of the most exciting, culturally diverse, romantic and historic cities in the country - New Orleans, LA.  We are planning thrilling events where you will learn from and about your favorite hosts.  Your feedback in PWLT is directly influencing how we build this convention to bring YOU the experiences you've asked for
Whether you love history, comedy, pop culture and current events or audio dramas, true crime, movies or sports, there will be something for every podlover.  For our inaugural convention, ticket sales are limited to 700 attendees. ​


PodernLove: Planning, Fundraising & Ticket Sales
The PodernLove planning committee is a group of hosts, listeners  and event planning professionals.   One of the most important steps in getting an event like this off the ground is booking the venue, and we are thrilled to announce PodernLove 2018 will be held  at the Intercontinental Hotel, a premiere, contemporary French Quarter hotel on St. Charles Ave.  
And here’s where we need your help.  The Indiegogo site provides you the opportunity to buy your tickets in advance, with a limited time discount as our way of saying thank you!  Advanced ticket sales ensure we can secure the venue and begin coordinating all of the fantastic events for PodernLove.  Advanced discounted ticket prices are only available for the next 30 days during the Indiegogo campaign.
Since this is a flexible campaign, all funds raised through the Indiegogo site will be used to pay for the PodernLove convention regardless of whether or not we hit our $200,000 goal within 30 days.  In addition to ticket sales there are opportunities to donate to the convention budget and receive great little perks for your donation.  
Ticket prices reflect advanced sale discount via Indiegogo.  Ticket prices will increase after the introductory Indiegogo campaign.  Once the Indiegogo campaign ends, tickets will be available via the PodernLove website.  



PodernLove: The Hotel
PodernLove 2018 will be held  at the Intercontinental Hotel, a premiere, contemporary French Quarter hotel on St. Charles Ave.
The special room rate for PodernLove attendees is only $129/night plus tax.  The hotel only requires a one night minimum deposit when you book your reservation.  Reservations can be made by calling the hotel at (504) 525-5566 or via their website at http://www.icneworleans.com/
And yes, the hotel does have a rooftop pool!


PodernLove: The Podcasts
Of course you want to know which shows will be participating.  And although it’s early, we have a few names we can share!  Keep checking back because we'll be updating this page, and our website which is under construction, with even more podcasts as the planning continues.

<h3>We're all about people and energy</h3>
<p>Achieving universal access to energy is a massive challenge on multiple levels: any entrepreneur will attest that finding technical solutions is only the start. But seeing how electricity access, cleaner stoves or a tap that delivers fresh water can transform lives, even in a small community, is a huge reward at the end of the long haul.  </p>
<p>This is what fascinates EnAct: the personal stories about who is changing whose life, and how. Time and again, we've seen our stories make the abstract concept of 'energy poverty' strikingly (even shockingly!) real. Hospital staff doing night rounds by the light of a cell phone. University students sharing batteries so they can study in dorms with no electricity.  An entire city--Kathmandu, Nepal no less--disappearing due to load-shedding. (Photo: P. Dicampo)<i> </i>  </p>

<p>We believe 'seeing' these lived realities is far more compelling than 'reading' global statistics and academic reports. Thus, a media outlet dedicated to the energy access story can play a key role in prompting others to take action. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>12 new stories for 2018</h3>
<p>With space secured in relevant magazines and online media, EnAct needs support to send journalists and photographers into the field. To the greatest degree possible, we work with locals to keep costs down and also build capacity in energy reporting. </p>
<p>Our cost to produce and place each article is about $2,500 - covering research, interviews, writing/editing, photography, graphic design, posting on our website and adapting for other outlets. </p>
<p>We've set our goal of $7,500 to secure funds for the first quarter of 2018, and will leave the campaign open until we hit the $30,000 needed for the full year. If we don't reach the goal, we'll still dedicate what we have to energy access reporting. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Can storytelling accelerate action?</h3>
<p>EnAct has already proven it can! In December 2016, we wrote about the SELCO Foundation adding solar-powered motors to treadle sewing machines, substantially boosting productivity of women tailors in India. Our readers donated more than $2000 to get 10 more machines fitted and distributed through the Foundation's micro-credit scheme. As initial loans are repaid, more women will benefit. (Photo: SELCO Foundation)</p>

<h3><strong>Being different is our greatest asset, and our biggest challenge</strong></h3>
<p>A key challenge for EnAct is that we are unlike the usual 'actors' in this space. We don't deliver solutions to needy communities; rather, we deliver solution stories to audiences with vested interests. We don't want to compete for investment in or support for energy solutions, but we believe raising awareness is critical to helping secure such engagement.</p>
<p>As media business models collapse around us, we also face the challenge of creating an alternative future. But we believe our unique approach of bringing together experts and award-winning storytellers has a clear benefit: the natural cross-training that occurs boosts knowledge on both sides, and builds trust across these two communities</p>
<p>Importantly, EnAct's approach delivers huge value to energy access actors. Beyond the broad media exposure, we also deliver high-quality images entrepreneurs can use for their own outreach, marketing and communications activities.</p>
<p>Finally, photos can be purchased by individuals who want to show colleagues, friends and family their personal commitment to improving energy access. (Photo: M. Smith) </p>

<li><strong>My challenges have always been lack of capital to hire A Team.

<li><strong>Being spread too thin was my main challenge when I solvently owned my massage center for six years, InnerCalm. A client once said to me ""Shouldn't it be called 'Outer Mania'?"". I was the owner/lead massage therapist/hiring manager/trainer/receptionist/marketing team/laundry lady and janitor. When I have the resources to hire help and delegate tasks, I don't get wrung out in the myriad of moving parts. Then I  am an extremely effective COCO (Chief Comedy Operating Officer). </strong></li>

Laughter is good for the immune system! It releases fell good endorphins. True!
Watching Liz massage a respectable silicone doll releases calming serotonin and oxytocin (I mean, I'm pretty sure). 

Risks & Challenges

My challenges have always been lack of capital to hire A Team. While I certainly can film, edit, promote/post to a zillion places, SEO optimize, etc. I have severe ADHD (formerly just diagnosed as ""Annoying""), so focusing on my comedic writing and performing talents rather than the operations side is sensible. 
Being spread too thin was my main challenge when I solvently owned my massage center for six years, InnerCalm. A client once said to me ""Shouldn't it be called 'Outer Mania'?"". I was the owner/lead massage therapist/hiring manager/trainer/receptionist/marketing team/laundry lady and janitor. When I have the resources to hire help and delegate tasks, I don't get wrung out in the myriad of moving parts. Then I  am an extremely effective COCO (Chief Comedy Operating Officer).

Despite these obstacles, Rachel has managed to achieve many great things through hard work and with help from her family. Rachel is a Pageant Winner, Singer, Model, Author and an important voice for Autism Awareness. We are honored to be partnered with such an amazing talent, and to help Rachel spread awareness and positivity through the NEWHD platform.
Please feel free to email us at newhdcampaigninfo@gmail.com if you have more questions.

""It's a new wave, a new plateau from the standpoint of entertainment"" 

""The thing I love the most about NEWHD Media is the fact that they're going to be helping kids with disabilities, kids with autism, kids that need a chance""
""With NEWHD Media, we're going to be a winning team! Just like my boys (NY Yankees) from the 70's""

FUNDING 
$12,500 is the minimum amount of funding needed to enable us to complete our development of NEWHD's online radio station platform, and hire our partner, Autism Self Advocate Rachel Barcellona. Currently we have a beta version of the online platform up on our website for preview, but we need funding to complete this and to also bring on Rachel to host her own show. The minimum amount is a great start, but we don't want to stop there. Once we reach our minimum goal, we hope that everyone who visits our campaign page will continue donating to help us build and grow into the amazing platform we know NEWHD Media can be.  
For questions or information regarding funding needs after reaching our minimum goal, please email us at newhdcampaigninfo@gmail.com
 

""I'm really excited about a new opportunity in radio that NEWHD Media is looking to jump into"" 
""New technologies have made it possible to produce and broadcast right from home""
""We'll be creating jobs for individuals living with disabilities and on the Autism spectrum""

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I’ll start by saying this project will go forward regardless of the results of this campaign, however; this project is important and deserves the investment of quality that comes from working with community partners that we will pay. I have set a flexible target of $25,000 - this is the amount required to put together an experience that will properly tell the story. I intend to use three storytelling techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>Live video interviews with stakeholders in the project</li>
<li>A narrative podcast that collects the prescient points from the interviews to create a comprehensive story</li>
<li>A ""B-Roll"" podcast where the interviews recorded in step 1 are available for future consumption.</li>
</ol>
<p>The $25,000 covers the costs of production work with our partner at web.isod.es - I anticipate rTraction contributing $15,00-20,000 of in kind work to backbone the project. We will also use some of the funds to promote the podcast and material once it has been finished.</p>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, we will use the funds to produce the best product possible with the funds available as we can get with our various partners and in-kind contributions.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The primary risk to this project is that I am wrong - that there is no primary narrative that exists in London, Ontario - or that if there is one it has nothing to do with Human Innovation.

Content Outline (for the first season)
I have lived in London for over 15 years and constantly hear about how our city is lacking, insufficient, or inadequate compared to other cities. I believe our city does amazing things and does not need to look to other cities for inspiration - our own population can supply all the inspiration that we need.At the end of our project  we will be able to have co-created a narrative to be proud of - I’m sure our story will revolve around our community’s support, investment, and commitment to opportunity. Our excellence in health care, digital media, social innovation and collaborative problem solving meets in our Community Innovation.Please help me to tell the story of our city!
What We Need & What You Get
I’ll start by saying this project will go forward regardless of the results of this campaign, however; this project is important and deserves the investment of quality that comes from working with community partners that we will pay. I have set a flexible target of $25,000 - this is the amount required to put together an experience that will properly tell the story. I intend to use three storytelling techniques:

Live video interviews with stakeholders in the project

<p>Ahora estamos aquí para que nos ayudes a conocerte en persona.</p>
<p>Para eso inventamos el <strong>No sé, dime tour</strong>.</p>
<p>Y queremos que su siguiente parada sea la hermosa ciudad de <strong>Bogotá</strong>, en <strong>Colombia</strong>.</p>
<h3>Qué es el <i>No sé, dime tour BOGOTÁ</i>
</h3>
<p>Agarrar nuestras maletas para ir a <strong>Bogotá</strong>, encontrar un teatro para grabar en vivo nuestro podcast contigo muerto de risa en el público, invitar a un ""salmón"" famoso de <strong>Colombia</strong> para que se siente con nosotros (si no has escuchado el podcast, no sabes qué es un ""salmón""... ¡cambia eso de ti!) y nos deje entrevistarlo para que nos cuente por qué también siente que no pertenece, documentar todo nuestro viaje con un equipo de profesionales audiovisuales de cada ciudad y convertir nuestro pequeño podcast casero en un programa de TV de verdad en el que los protagonistas son los <i>#superdiamantes</i> que nos escuchan en todo el mundo.</p>
<h3><b>Cómo queremos hacerlo</b></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Hacer un programa como este es súper ambicioso. No solo tienes que invertir en la producción del evento, en los pasajes, en el alojamiento, sino también en trabajar con un equipo de profesionales con la experiencia suficiente para garantizar que el resultado final no tenga nada que envidiarle a programas que puedes ver en lugares como <strong>Netflix</strong> o <strong>HBO</strong>.</p>
<p>A lo mejor no lo sabes, pero un sólo episodio de un programa así puede llegar a costar cientos de miles de dólares en el mundo real.</p>
<h3>Por qué nosotros</h3>
<p>Si nos conoces sabes que desde hace años hemos desarrollado proyectos para <strong>Youtube</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>Snap Inc</strong>, <strong>Batanga Media</strong>, <strong>AOL</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>HLN</strong>, <strong>Univision</strong>,<strong> Discovery</strong>, <strong>NBC Universo</strong>, <strong>Mitú</strong>, <strong>Fullscreen</strong>, <strong>Clevver TV</strong>, <strong>Broadway Video</strong> y marcas como <strong>McDonalds</strong>, <strong>Bud Light</strong>, <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Volvo</strong>, <strong>Ford</strong>, <strong>Covergirl</strong>, <strong>Makeup Forever</strong>, <strong>Best Buy</strong>, <strong>Target</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Johnny Walker</strong>, entre muchas otras.</p>
<p>Parte de las cosas que hemos hecho las puedes encontrar <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8_L7fhCwtqLA4ATvFtS52w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">aquí</a>. </p>
<p>Juntos hemos estado nominados a los <a href=""https://www.tubefilter.com/2013/02/21/visto-bueno-international-series/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Streamy Awards</a> 3 veces (más veces que cualquier creador Latino)</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FKaEbZTf290?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>a los <a href=""http://la.eonline.com/venezuela/enews/maiah-ocando-vuelve-a-ser-reconocida-como-una-de-las-mejores-de-internet-videos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shorty Awards</a>...</p>
<p>Y hasta teníamos <a href=""https://www.univision.com/estilo-de-vida/trending/conoce-a-maiah-ocando-en-preguntas-de-10-segundos-y-sin-filtro"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">nuestra sección en un noticiero todas las semanas.</a></p>
<p>Luego creamos este podcast y han hablado de él en <a href=""http://la.eonline.com/mexico/enews/la-youtuber-que-decidio-compartir-los-bochornos-las-penas-y-la-soledad-de-ser-una-youtuber/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">E!

<p>Pero nada de eso importa tanto como que tú lo veas y escuches cada semana.</p>
<p>Por eso esto queremos llevarlo a otro nivel y hacerlo teniendo control del proyecto y dejando que seas tú mismo quién está detrás de esto.</p>
<p>Queremos algo de superdiamantes para superdiamantes.</p>
<p>Y aunque nosotros somos buenos consiguiendo ayuda y haciendo que cosas de ultra bajo presupuesto se vean bien, aún así necesitamos un monto mínimo para poder llevar el <strong>No sé, dime tour</strong> a cada país.</p>
<p><strong>No hacemos esto para hacernos millonarios</strong>, pero sí creemos que con tu ayuda podríamos hacer algo que nos gusta a nosotros y a ti por muchísimos años más.</p>
<h3>El problema</h3>
<p>Montar esta producción tiene costos operativos importantes.</p>
<p>Desde conseguir el teatro hasta conseguir alojamiento, los pasajes, grabar, editar todo para que esté al nivel de un programa de televisión...</p>
<p>Así que si vamos a hacerlo, vamos a hacerlo bien y repetir esto en todos los países que podamos.</p>
<p>Pero si nuestros superdiamantes de <strong>Bogotá</strong> nos han dicho la verdad, no sólo podemos hacer esto sino cualquier cosa.</p>
<p>Tenemos en ustedes todo lo que hace falta para lograrlo. </p>
<p>Y lo mejor es que podremos seguir escribiendo el libro que lees semana a semana en <a href=""https://www.wedontbelong.com/es/category/we-dont-belong-here/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wedontbelong,com</a> y podemos seguir grabando series como <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFkSF132-1Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">One Girl Show</a> y seguir luchando por nuestros sueños locos en Hollywood.</p>
<h3><strong>Lo que nos hace falta</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Al menos entre 600 y 850 superdiamantes en cada ciudad  que compren una entrada a un precio súper asequible.</li>
<li>Recaudar con la venta de esas entradas al menos $20,000 para ir a <strong>Bogotá</strong>.</li>
<li>Utilizar parte de ese dinero para producir un evento genial y convertirlo en un episodio de nuestro programa.</li>
<li>Usar el resto para seguir haciendo el podcast y todo nuestro contenido cada semana.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cómo lo utilizaremos</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alquiler del Teatro (entre 30% y 50% de lo recaudado)</li>
<li>Merch</li>
<li>Logística (Alojamiento, pasajes, transporte, comidas)</li>
<li>Alquiler de equipos</li>
<li>Honorarios de producción</li>
<li>Mercadeo de la gira</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Lo que ofrecemos</strong></h3>
<p>Además de entradas para que nos acompañes a dejar el corazón en un teatro de la hermosa ciudad de Bogotá en un show que tú mismo crearás con nosotros, tenemos <i>perks </i>para superdiamantes que quieran y puedan contribuir con un poquito más para obtener desde cosas súper especiales como franelas que sólo van a estás disponibles si hacemos el tour, estar en los créditos de la serie como productores, o hasta ser invitados especiales en un podcast con nosotros (¡la pizza corre por nuestra cuenta!).</p>
<h3>Por qué te necesitamos</h3>
<p>Hemos estado haciendo encuestas. Sé qué nos hemos puesto fastidiosos, pero necesitamos estar 100% seguros de que en las ciudades a las que vamos hay suficientes de ustedes para hacer esto.  </p>
<p>Te necesitamos porque no sólo no tenemos dinero para pagar la gira de nuestro bolsillo, sino porque si no logramos que esta gira pase hay muchísimas cosas que muy probable tendremos que también dejar de hacer.</p>
<h3><strong>El reto</strong></h3>
<p>Queremos arrancar la gira oficialmente <strong>después del 15 de Septiembre</strong>, por lo que necesitamos producir todo durante el verano. Por eso <strong>debemos recaudar el dinero de cada ciudad en sólo 10 días</strong>. De esta forma podemos hacer esta misma campaña en las siguiente ciudad hasta completar todas las que podamos comprometernos a visitar este año.</p>
<p>La idea es comenzar con una ciudad y si logramos la meta, hacer otra y otra y otra hasta que podamos llegar a la mayor cantidad de ciudades posibles.</p>
<p>Como ves, estamos apostándolo todo a esto.</p>
<p>Esto es lo que queremos: si logramos hacer al menos 5 ciudades podemos seguir haciendo el podcast.</p>
<p>Si no, tendremos que cancelar todo.</p>
<p>Tal vez no vives en <strong>Bogotá</strong>, pero conoces a alguien que vive en <strong>Bogotá</strong> y que crees que puede gustarle nuestro podcast, pues mándale esta campaña para que vaya por tí.</p>
<p>Luego, cuando le toque a tu ciudad ya sabes lo que tienes que hacer.</p>
<p>Y así hasta que los superdiamantes conquistemos el mundo.</p>
<p>¿Contamos contigo?</p>

Y hasta teníamos nuestra sección en un noticiero todas las semanas.
Luego creamos este podcast y han hablado de él en E! Entertainment Television, en Radio Caracol, en CNN y hasta nos metieron en la lista de los podcast que definitivament deberías escuchar de la revista Latina.
Pero nada de eso importa tanto como que tú lo veas y escuches cada semana.
Por eso esto queremos llevarlo a otro nivel y hacerlo teniendo control del proyecto y dejando que seas tú mismo quién está detrás de esto.
Queremos algo de superdiamantes para superdiamantes.
Y aunque nosotros somos buenos consiguiendo ayuda y haciendo que cosas de ultra bajo presupuesto se vean bien, aún así necesitamos un monto mínimo para poder llevar el No sé, dime tour a cada país.
No hacemos esto para hacernos millonarios, pero sí creemos que con tu ayuda podríamos hacer algo que nos gusta a nosotros y a ti por muchísimos años más.
El problema
Montar esta producción tiene costos operativos importantes.
Desde conseguir el teatro hasta conseguir alojamiento, los pasajes, grabar, editar todo para que esté al nivel de un programa de televisión...
Así que si vamos a hacerlo, vamos a hacerlo bien y repetir esto en todos los países que podamos.
Pero si nuestros superdiamantes de Bogotá nos han dicho la verdad, no sólo podemos hacer esto sino cualquier cosa.
Tenemos en ustedes todo lo que hace falta para lograrlo. 
Y lo mejor es que podremos seguir escribiendo el libro que lees semana a semana en wedontbelong,com y podemos seguir grabando series como One Girl Show y seguir luchando por nuestros sueños locos en Hollywood.
Lo que nos hace falta

Al menos entre 600 y 850 superdiamantes en cada ciudad  que compren una entrada a un precio súper asequible.
Recaudar con la venta de esas entradas al menos $20,000 para ir a Bogotá.
Utilizar parte de ese dinero para producir un evento genial y convertirlo en un episodio de nuestro programa.
Usar el resto para seguir haciendo el podcast y todo nuestro contenido cada semana.

Cómo lo utilizaremos

Alquiler del Teatro (entre 30% y 50% de lo recaudado)
Merch
Logística (Alojamiento, pasajes, transporte, comidas)
Alquiler de equipos
Honorarios de producción
Mercadeo de la gira

Lo que ofrecemos
Además de entradas para que nos acompañes a dejar el corazón en un teatro de la hermosa ciudad de Bogotá en un show que tú mismo crearás con nosotros, tenemos perks para superdiamantes que quieran y puedan contribuir con un poquito más para obtener desde cosas súper especiales como franelas que sólo van a estás disponibles si hacemos el tour, estar en los créditos de la serie como productores, o hasta ser invitados especiales en un podcast con nosotros (¡la pizza corre por nuestra cuenta!).
Por qué te necesitamos
Hemos estado haciendo encuestas. Sé qué nos hemos puesto fastidiosos, pero necesitamos estar 100% seguros de que en las ciudades a las que vamos hay suficientes de ustedes para hacer esto.  
Te necesitamos porque no sólo no tenemos dinero para pagar la gira de nuestro bolsillo, sino porque si no logramos que esta gira pase hay muchísimas cosas que muy probable tendremos que también dejar de hacer.
El reto
Queremos arrancar la gira oficialmente después del 15 de Septiembre, por lo que necesitamos producir todo durante el verano. Por eso debemos recaudar el dinero de cada ciudad en sólo 10 días. De esta forma podemos hacer esta misma campaña en las siguiente ciudad hasta completar todas las que podamos comprometernos a visitar este año.
La idea es comenzar con una ciudad y si logramos la meta, hacer otra y otra y otra hasta que podamos llegar a la mayor cantidad de ciudades posibles.
Como ves, estamos apostándolo todo a esto.
Esto es lo que queremos: si logramos hacer al menos 5 ciudades podemos seguir haciendo el podcast.
Si no, tendremos que cancelar todo.
Tal vez no vives en Bogotá, pero conoces a alguien que vive en Bogotá y que crees que puede gustarle nuestro podcast, pues mándale esta campaña para que vaya por tí.
Luego, cuando le toque a tu ciudad ya sabes lo que tienes que hacer.
Y así hasta que los superdiamantes conquistemos el mundo.
¿Contamos contigo?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are artists - Writers, Directors and Actors - who have been creating and performing for the public our entire careers.  Many of us have worked together and supported each other for decades.  Passionate about our work and committed to the performing arts, we have come together to bring this serialized podcast - a relatively young art form - to life.  Through downloads, a podcast has the potential to reach many more people than a live performance.  In this way, we can bring the arts to a wider population.</p>
<p>The Chronicles of Wallace Sprague, Dog Psychiatrist, was created and written by Cate Allen, an award-winning playwright and directed by Eric Nightengale who has been involved with theater productions for more than 30 years.  Together with David Arrow, another experienced theater professional in the dual role of producer and actor, this team has logged countless hours to assemble a talented group of professional actors and oversee the recording, sound effects and editing.</p>
<p>We need to raise money to continue creating Season 1 and Season 2.  The money we raise will go directly to record, edit and pay our talent.  By contributing you help keep the episodes coming and support the arts.  You can contribute at any level, but if you contribute at a minimum level ($25), we will express our gratitude on our show website, WallaceSprague.com.  For higher contribution levels you will have the opportunity to receive a beautiful set of show logo coasters, a show logo t-shirt, a mention at the end of an episode (or two) and an autographed script of the pilot episode by the creator and writer, Cate Allen.  So please contribute if you can and we will strive to bring you the highest quality storytelling podcast out there!</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Joia, and I'm a writer, teacher, and consultant based out of the NYC-metro area. Last year, I developed a new 10-session workshop course that combines teaching meditation, writing, and critical thinking skills. It's called 'The Power of Thought: How to Think More Logically, Creatively, and Compassionately.'   </p>
<p>The course -- and this new project -- are aimed for Thinkers, people who value reason, logic, and creativity, who want to improve these skills to make a greater productive impact on the world and improve their social relations.</p>
<p>One of the skills I examine in the course is 'Understanding People On Their Own Terms.'  ""Terms"" refers not only to the specific words and concepts that individuals use to understand themselves and the world, but more broadly to their basic motivations and values and underlying premises and ideas.</p>
<p>I realized it would be useful to demonstrate this approach to interactions in the concrete form of an interview conversation.  And further, if these conversations were shared widely they could spark further conversations and exercises in critical and compassionate thinking.</p>
<p>The basic format of the show will be this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>The Story</strong>: I begin by asking the guest (thought-leaders from various fields, potentially representing a range of diverse views) to describe their life-story journey, the significant steps leading them to develop the particular ideas they've come to promote.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Content</strong>: We discuss the ideas they're advocating, exploring not only the what, but the how's and why's, the arguments and motivations behind the ideas.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Meta-Level Reflection</strong>: Most significantly, we then take a step back and look explicitly at the method and approaches to thinking they've used, trying to identify any explicit take-away's.</li>
<li>
<strong>Guest Recommendations</strong>: And we'll end by having the guest mention any specific recommendations  they may have for the audience to improve their knowledge, skills, and thought.</li>
</ol>
<p>I expect that in each of these interviews, I will probably agree with the guests on some points and disagree on others.  But the purpose will be for the guests to have an opportunity to express themselves on their own terms, and for me (and you, the audience!) to thus understand their perspective as a basis for any further interactions. </p>
<p>My hope is these conversations inspire and provoke further conversations and exercises in civil discourse as we each try to better our own thinking.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal in this Indiegogo campaign is to try to raise enough funds to at least produce a prototype/pilot episode of the show. Based on my research, this should cost around $2,500.</p>
<p>I firmly believe this show will be most effective if it is produced with the craft and care of high production values. (Note: the current photos are what I can get for free from a smartphone, and don't convey the clarity and production quality that I believe would make this show truly worthwhile).  For example, TED Talks consistently put out video produced at high standards, and it is a critical component to their success in spreading ideas.</p>
<p>To produce a high-quality film will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Space rental here in New York City</li>
<li>Lighting and high quality filming</li>
<li>Video-editing and graphics</li>
<li>Web development</li>
</ul>
<p>When completed, the one-hour interview will be posted free on YouTube for easy sharing.  We'll also make the audio available for those who prefer a podcast format. Contributors can also receive exclusive bonus footage and other perks.</p>

<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
<p><i>B.1993 Da'Niro Elle is an socially engaged curator, arts professional, and transdisciplinary artist her work explores the black experience. An experience grounded in both the Western media’s manipulation of black imagery and the nostalgic images that decorated our homes and amused us. Through the use of the body as medium, multiple bodies, multiple diverse bodies, text, rhythm, objects, and curated sound to create a physical spaces, Da’Niro Elle’s work offers a unique perspective on the future of humanity, while assertively commenting on present day society. Working through notions of conflict and trauma, the core of my work reveals my obsession with the construction of identity. She received her BFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Da’Niro Elle has shown work recently at The Museum of Modern Art, The Gene Siskle Theater, and Golden Thread Gallery. She is currently based in Brooklyn, NY.</i></p>

<h3>ABOUT THE SHOW</h3>
<p><i>A podcast &amp; visual channel named after a novel, written by art critic and activist Kellie Jones in 2011. <strong>Eyeminded </strong>seeks to continue Jones’s efforts, bringing attention to works created by artist belonging to underrepresented communities and work that challenges established institutional models. This channel aims to not only continue the conversation but to also generate new dialogue and propose new questions surrounding the current state of the contemporary art world. <strong>Eyeminded</strong> covers current exhibitions, art academia, and current political and cultural events and conversations focused in the arts. The purpose of this channel is to make art more accessible to communities of people that don’t have the same resources to take in art in institutional settings. Discussing everything from the LA Rebellion, to the Afro Futurist Movement, <strong>Eyeminded</strong> aims to illuminate voices belonging to emerging and mid career artists, curators, critics, gallerist and other art professionals of color. Through lively and unfiltered conversations with these special guest we discuss the world of art as well as their practices. <strong>Eyeminded</strong> is an arts and culture podcast and show that discusses different topics each episode, and with each episode the show breaks down language exploring new narratives within the arts, setting a stage for people of color to discuss things in a true, raw form.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Eyeminded will be available on all streaming and viewing services including Spotify, Itunes, Youtube, and Soundcloud. <br/><br/><u>Add Eyeminded on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/eyeminded_thechannel/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>, <a href=""http://twitter.com/EyemindedC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTu920kHrT9OUzPXEdjDhzQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Youtube </a>coming soon. </u></i></p>
<h3>ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN?</h3>
<p><i>This campaign was started to provide <strong>Eyeminded</strong> with the proper start it deserves.</i></p>
<p><i>And as a young femme and creative of color with no financial assistance, this is an open call for support and help from those who appreciate my work and want to support my practice. This channel is something that has now grown and expanded past my own artistic narrative, which is why I am raising this money to establish a foundation and proper platform for <strong>Eyeminded</strong> to be developed up to the rigorous standards I hold for myself and all of my work. I did not and do not want to cut any corners when it comes to the production of this project. </i></p>
<p><i>With your support of <strong>Eyeminded</strong>  you will help us raise money for so many important elements that help start a new self-funded media project. Contributions will go towards the purchasing of professional grade equipment for the recording and documentation of each episode. These supplies include camera, a led light kit, tripod, mics, and other audio equipment. Along with the rental cost for the shooting location which will happen bi-weekly as we begin production, this campaign will also go towards the support of our small but mighty crew, all creatives of color looking to be contribute to the conversation and the change we seek. Your contributions to this campaign will help also provide a comfortable and welcoming set and environment, feeding the crew during shoot days and will provide a stipend for each crew member, including two camera operators, one audio &amp; sound engineer, and one production assistants. </i></p>
<p><i>If given the opportunity and your support I know <strong>Eyeminded</strong> will help completely transform the landscape of media focused on artists and and other emerging creatives of color all over the world. </i></p>
<h3>WHY WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE.</h3>
<p><i>As mentioned earlier I face many obstacles including the constant financial battle of day to day life living in Brooklyn New York. My move to New York was a important decision for my artistic practice and its growth. I wanted to continue to bet on myself bet on my talent, bet on my drive, bet of my ability to seize the moment and it has been challenging, but it has also generated some of the best moments of my life. I also have to factor in my health, as I am currently battling a chronic illness called Lupus which is something that also limits my abilities and poses a daily challenge to my survival as an artist. In consideration of this, I have come to understand without all of your support I will not be able to hold <strong>Eyeminded</strong>  to the standard I see for it promising future. But with your help and support I will be able to devote more of my time to Eyeminded, as this project is not only something I see as an outlet for artist and other emerging art professionals representing underrepresented communities, but also a platform to teach and welcome new conversations and allies who are looking to truly understand what it means to be a person representing the other and learning how we all share the responsibility to do better.</i></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>As you might have guessed, my name is Deyan. </p>
<p>I produce written board game content on a daily basis. Sometimes I shoot videos. But videos cost money. So... yeah. Let's not focus on those. </p>
<p>If you have been following me you also know that i write my articles only in Bulgarian. So this being in English is weird, i guess. Am i being weird? I am weird. That's why you love me though!</p>
<p>I have been doing this kind of weird board game related stuff for more than six years and the popularity of the blog has raised significantly. Also, I often participate in Bulgarian board game conventions and try to be informed of anything board game related not only in my country but world wide as well. </p>
<p>However, its not easy blogging about stuff if you are only staying at home and never meet with publishers, designers and other content creators. Is Antoine Bauza a real person? I don't know. Never met him. Can Tom Vasel kick my ass? Probably. What is the difference between the Brunos?  Which publisher smells the best? All the vital info a blogger needs.</p>
<p>The problem is that all the hard work put in the blog does not pay the bills. Apart from receiving review copies I am not being paid in any way. Plus, blogging is still a hobby that fuels on pure maniacal enthusiasm. </p>
<p>So what I am asking is to be able to go to Germany, meet cool guys, buy games and party on your expense. Simple as that.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561961582/adkz5k1xerrtkgxzpowh.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Alright, alright!  It's actually really important for me. Going to Essen has been a dream for years and not being able to go hurts my reviewer's soul and I really feel guilty each time i miss a con and all the opportunities it gives a blogger. To be honest, last year I did manage to visit the Spiel for the first time, but that happened because stars were perfectly aligned in the Crit goddess was kind to be. I don't see that happening this year, unfortunately. </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What do I need money for exactly? </h3>
<p>Your money will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tickets (convention and airplane)</li>
<li>Rent-a-car expenses</li>
<li>Accommodation</li>
<li>For food and stuff</li>
<li>For paying my cameraman, illustrator and editor</li>
</ul>
<p>If we manage to raise a few extra bucks, there will be some for buying games but lets not get that far ahead. </p>
<h3>Why help Deyan in the first place?</h3>
<p>Well, I don't know. Cause you're a crazy person? Or you like throwing money in random dudes' faces. </p>
<p>The truth though is that I really need this for boosting my blogging confidence and in helping me achieve this, you are actually prolonging the life of Bigboxgamers. And I will love you forever.</p>

Never met him. Can Tom Vasel kick my ass? Probably. What is the difference between the Brunos?  Which publisher smells the best? All the vital info a blogger needs.
The problem is that all the hard work put in the blog does not pay the bills. Apart from receiving review copies I am not being paid in any way. Plus, blogging is still a hobby that fuels on pure maniacal enthusiasm. 
So what I am asking is to be able to go to Germany, meet cool guys, buy games and party on your expense. Simple as that.  


Alright, alright!  It's actually really important for me. Going to Essen has been a dream for years and not being able to go hurts my reviewer's soul and I really feel guilty each time i miss a con and all the opportunities it gives a blogger. To be honest, last year I did manage to visit the Spiel for the first time, but that happened because stars were perfectly aligned in the Crit goddess was kind to be. I don't see that happening this year, unfortunately. 

What do I need money for exactly? 
Your money will be used for:

Tickets (convention and airplane)
Rent-a-car expenses
Accommodation
For food and stuff
For paying my cameraman, illustrator and editor

If we manage to raise a few extra bucks, there will be some for buying games but lets not get that far ahead. 
Why help Deyan in the first place?
Well, I don't know. Cause you're a crazy person? Or you like throwing money in random dudes' faces. 
The truth though is that I really need this for boosting my blogging confidence and in helping me achieve this, you are actually prolonging the life of Bigboxgamers. And I will love you forever.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>I started a podcast because I love movies and tv shows, and I want to get my work to be experienced in the most accessible way possible. I started an Indiegogo to help with the operating expenses for the media company I’m building called BetweenUsTwo.</p>
<p>Chaka and Lani is a narrative podcast about two women fighting to keep their business sailing, their friendship together and their family united. They run a studio for artists which allows for comedic characters with playful personalities. The main theme is outgrowing our trauma and creating room for good things to come.</p>
<p>A “talk show” is also in development. The first episode talks about death, plastic surgeries, emotional well being, Doja Cat’s ass, and God. I pull from my love of punk &amp; hip hop aesthetics and structure.</p>
<p>This is the beginning for Between UsTwo. Once the podcast is sustaining, next is books and then animation. The biggest goal is to craft a universe. The immediate goal is to get the work out there!</p>
<p><br/><strong>What We Need </strong></p>

<h3>We're all about people and energy</h3>
<p>Achieving universal access to energy is a massive challenge on multiple levels: any entrepreneur will attest that finding technical solutions is only the start. But seeing how electricity access, cleaner stoves or a tap that delivers fresh water can transform lives, even in a small community, is a huge reward at the end of the long haul.  </p>
<p>This is what fascinates EnAct: the personal stories about who is changing whose life, and how. Time and again, we've seen our stories make the abstract concept of 'energy poverty' strikingly (even shockingly!) real. Hospital staff doing night rounds by the light of a cell phone. University students sharing batteries so they can study in dorms with no electricity.  An entire city--Kathmandu, Nepal no less--disappearing due to load-shedding. (Photo: P. Dicampo)   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517492351/creyl0fw4fuozp0klgq4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We believe 'seeing' these lived realities is far more compelling than 'reading' global statistics and academic reports. Thus, a media outlet dedicated to the energy access story can play a key role in prompting others to take action. </p>
<h3>12 new stories for 2018</h3>
<p>With space secured in relevant magazines and online media, EnAct needs support to send journalists and photographers into the field. To the greatest degree possible, we work with locals to keep costs down and also build capacity in energy reporting. </p>
<p>Our cost to produce and place each article is about $2,500 - covering research, interviews, writing/editing, photography, graphic design, posting on our website and adapting for other outlets. </p>
<p>We've set our goal of $7,500 to secure funds for the first quarter of 2018, and will leave the campaign open until we hit the $30,000 needed for the full year. If we don't reach the goal, we'll still dedicate what we have to energy access reporting. </p>
<h3>Can storytelling accelerate action?</h3>
<p>EnAct has already proven it can! In December 2016, we wrote about the SELCO Foundation adding solar-powered motors to treadle sewing machines, substantially boosting productivity of women tailors in India.

<h3>Being different is our greatest asset, and our biggest challenge</h3>
<p>A key challenge for EnAct is that we are unlike the usual 'actors' in this space. We don't deliver solutions to needy communities; rather, we deliver solution stories to audiences with vested interests. We don't want to compete for investment in or support for energy solutions, but we believe raising awareness is critical to helping secure such engagement.</p>
<p>As media business models collapse around us, we also face the challenge of creating an alternative future. But we believe our unique approach of bringing together experts and award-winning storytellers has a clear benefit: the natural cross-training that occurs boosts knowledge on both sides, and builds trust across these two communities</p>
<p>Importantly, EnAct's approach delivers huge value to energy access actors. Beyond the broad media exposure, we also deliver high-quality images entrepreneurs can use for their own outreach, marketing and communications activities.</p>

<h3>More ways to support EnAct &amp; energy actors</h3>
<p>EnAct and the energy innovators behind these great stories know that financial contributions are not always possible. Equally valuable to us help in two other ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Tell us your story!</strong> If you are active in energy access, drop us about what you do. We'll see how we can help others learn about it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Spread the word!</strong>  Share these stories through your own social media channels and encourage your colleagues, friends and family to help out. You can follow us here: <ul>
<li>Facebook: <strong>The Energy Action Project </strong>
</li>
<li>Twitter:<strong> @EnActNow</strong>
</li>
<li>Instagram: <strong>@everyday_energy</strong><br/><br/><strong>We believe it's time for everyone to 'get' energy. Hope you'll give us a hand! </strong>
</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","We're all about people and energy
Achieving universal access to energy is a massive challenge on multiple levels: any entrepreneur will attest that finding technical solutions is only the start. But seeing how electricity access, cleaner stoves or a tap that delivers fresh water can transform lives, even in a small community, is a huge reward at the end of the long haul.  
This is what fascinates EnAct: the personal stories about who is changing whose life, and how. Time and again, we've seen our stories make the abstract concept of 'energy poverty' strikingly (even shockingly!) real. Hospital staff doing night rounds by the light of a cell phone. University students sharing batteries so they can study in dorms with no electricity.  An entire city--Kathmandu, Nepal no less--disappearing due to load-shedding. (Photo: P. Dicampo)   

We believe 'seeing' these lived realities is far more compelling than 'reading' global statistics and academic reports. Thus, a media outlet dedicated to the energy access story can play a key role in prompting others to take action. 
12 new stories for 2018
With space secured in relevant magazines and online media, EnAct needs support to send journalists and photographers into the field. To the greatest degree possible, we work with locals to keep costs down and also build capacity in energy reporting. 
Our cost to produce and place each article is about $2,500 - covering research, interviews, writing/editing, photography, graphic design, posting on our website and adapting for other outlets. 
We've set our goal of $7,500 to secure funds for the first quarter of 2018, and will leave the campaign open until we hit the $30,000 needed for the full year. If we don't reach the goal, we'll still dedicate what we have to energy access reporting. 
Can storytelling accelerate action?
EnAct has already proven it can! In December 2016, we wrote about the SELCO Foundation adding solar-powered motors to treadle sewing machines, substantially boosting productivity of women tailors in India. Our readers donated more than $2000 to get 10 more machines fitted and distributed through the Foundation's micro-credit scheme. As initial loans are repaid, more women will benefit.

Importantly, EnAct's approach delivers huge value to energy access actors. Beyond the broad media exposure, we also deliver high-quality images entrepreneurs can use for their own outreach, marketing and communications activities.
Finally, photos can be purchased by individuals who want to show colleagues, friends and family their personal commitment to improving energy access. (Photo: M. Smith)

<h3>JOM on the GO</h3>
<p>Ever wanted to get up and go; travel without limits or time constraints? Have you yearned to make the whole world your home? Well so have we. Meet Jo and OM or better known as JOM:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are partners looking to adapt our lifestyle into a digital nomad experience. We are both artists with backgrounds in film, television, modeling/print as well as holistic practices including life/relationship coaching, yoga, and reiki to name a few.</li>
<li>This campaign is focused around freedom, and that’s what you are contributing to when you donate. Your funds will allow us to purchase and outfit a van to travel and live in.</li>
<li>Your contribution will secure a strong positioning for us to be successful in transitioning into van life and will provide space time for us to focus on what we love; artistry and helping people to become their greatest selves.</li>
</ul>
<p>So whether you’re an artist, an adventurer or simply want to live vicariously, you’ll definitely want to take a look at our perks and support where you can.</p>
<p>Check out some of the Van Lifers that inspired us:</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a van to convert into a home to provide shelter and travel:</p>
<ul>
<li>The funding you provide will go towards purchasing a solid vehicle in addition to making the necessary modifications to the van to make it home appropriate. This includes but is not limited to: sink, stove, shower/bathroom, bed, and solar. The goal is off-grid autonomy.</li>
<li>Our perks are as diverse as we are. From original artwork, to concerts, to one on one sessions, to an actual home visit anywhere in the US! We wanted to offer something we’ve never come across on Indiegogo</li>
<li>Regardless of if we hit our goal (and with your help and dedication we are certain to do so) the funds will be used the same no matter the outcome: which is to purchase a van and home fit it.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your impact will turn this dream into a reality. It will allow us to reach and help more people, and for us to grow as individuals and a unit through our travels and interactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In these times it is evident that the world needs healing and change. We are healers quite literally; bringing about change, healing, positivity and up lifting all we come into contact with.</li>
<li>In the past we have produced successful multiple city tours with a standard sedan. This provided valuable experiences and lessons. One major take away was how efficient these travels would be if our vehicle was our home. </li>
<li>We aren’t backed by any major corporations or sponsorships, which is why your support goes along way. We are simply two humans looking to live an alternative existence for a healthier, happier, and more enjoyable life. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are keenly aware that this lifestyle isn’t for everyone, which is why we are living it. Whether you’re inspired by our journey or could never and think we’re sheer entertainment, we invite you to come along. Van life isn’t as simple or glamorous as Instagram makes it out to be. It requires resilience, durability, and adaptability. If we come up short with this campaign, that means we have no bathroom, which has a great impact on our day to day functioning. Also living in a van does keep us bit more “exposed” and police harassment is a real risk. The more equipped we are, the safer we are, the better experience this transition will be.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Having traveled internationally, living in all major markets (New York, Chicago, LA, and Atlanta) has provided life experience and adaptability. It’s because we’ve moved so many times and are already so nomadic that we figured instead of fighting it, we’d fully embrace it.</li>
<li>The best way to solve a problem is being solution oriented. This is a habit that we’ve practiced for over a decade now. There’s no value in being stressed and emotional over unfortunate circumstances. That energy is better used towards figuring out how to change those circumstances and leveraging them to your advantage.</li>

Operated by Wren and Fritz Walker, from 1997 until the end of 2019, offered meaningful connections that helped create the online community.

Welcome to the Pagan World Project, your access to the Pagan Community, local to global. - A Message from Oberon ZellI’m Oberon Zell, and I’m speaking to you on behalf of the exciting Pagan World Project, which I’m proud to represent.  As a Founding Father, and the first person to adopt the identity of Pagan for the nascent movement—in 1967—I love this community, with its unique potential to lead our wounded world into a healing—and an Awakening.  Our scattered People want to connect to the greater Pagan community—to come Home. The Internet today allows us to connect and share our communities in ways never before possible—or even imaginable! Pagan World will provide a central directory for you to discover your local and global groups, shops, services and events. We intend to provide access to teachers, guides, classes and circles for as many seekers as possible. And as a lover of great festivals—many of which I attend—for them to be better listed and even more accessible to our growing community.Pagan World is the next generation of Pagan directories, like those once put out by my Green Egg magazine, Selena Fox’s Circle Guide to Wicca and Pagan Resources, and Wren and Fritz Walker’s online WitchVox, which closed last year.

Operated by Wren and Fritz Walker, from 1997 until the end of 2019, offered meaningful connections that helped create the online community. The shock of the end of WitchVox and its erasure from the web has left a painful hole as well as a myth and legacy, leaving the community to its own resources.  In 2020, the sense of loss of this wonderful tool to community building has grown.Pagan. World is New! Pagan.World is a new project that will allow us to reconnect, relink, and redevelop a new directory, with the goal of developing community tools. Pagan. World seeks to continue the work that Witchvox has shown that is so desperately needed by the Pagan community.

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p><br/>My name is Florence, half Italian, half Nigerian, born and raised in Florence, Italy. For the past five years I have been living in Paris. Before settling down in France, I have visited 20 countries between 2004 and 2011. I am the editor and photographer behind Florence Out Loud blogzine-to-be ;)</p>

<h3>In a nutshell, Florence Out Loud is:</h3>
<p>- a <strong>blogzine</strong>, where you will find different categories of articles of interest: photography, video, storytelling,.... Why have we to choose, right? It is a multi-faceted space where you can find articles about responsible travelling, ecotourism, conscious lifestyle, free-plastic life reflections, stories and portraits from all around the world…</p>
<p>- a <strong>mapping</strong> of existing eco, responsible accommodations, travel operators and community-based tourism addresses all around the world, to help you choose the tourism professionals to contact for your next solo/couple travel, family vacation, friends trip, and so on…</p>
<p>- an <strong>interactive web-documentary</strong> where I will gather photographs, videos, sounds and interviews like you were with me in the journey  (created with Klynt App/ klynt.net)</p>

<h3><strong>Why this project? Why now?</strong></h3>
<p>Like many others I decided that 2017 will be the year of great changes in my life and I committed myself to start living my life on my own terms!</p>
<p>After a great experience last summer in Malaysia and Singapore, I decided to take some time to explore the other world’s wonders and bought a Round-The-World ticket.</p>
<p>Even if I really appreciated that trip, I somehow feel that I missed a bit the contact with local people. That’s why I started to search how to maximize the positive impact and minimize the negative one of travelling!</p>
<p> I came across a lot of websites about community-based tourism, responsible travel and so on but sources were multiple. I therefore thought that maybe it coul be useful to assemble all information available on the net in one space, adding stories from people who obtained benefits from responsible travelling. </p>
<p>Last but not least, United Nations has designated 2017 as International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, proving that tourism can be a real measure of empowerment for local communities able to fight poverty and social exclusion, fostering cross-cultural understanding and mutual solidarity among people. </p>

<p><strong>The purpose of the blogzine is simply to show that, near or far, anyone can and should be a responsible traveller and citizen capable of making conscious choices.</strong></p>

<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>If you are not interested in any of the rewards and I couldn't convince you to give it a try until now, there are still a few ways you can help me!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Donate!</strong> If you'd like to support me without claiming a reward, you can do that as well! Simply click on ""Back it"" and you can put in any amount you'd like to donate. </li>
<li>
<strong>Spread the love for photography and responsible travel!</strong> I am sure you know a friend that knows a friend of friends (LOL!!!) that you think would be interested in supporting this project. Forward them this website, tell them all about me and ask them to back the project! </li>
<li>
<strong>Post about it!</strong> On Instagram, on Facebook, on your website, in the comments of your favourite travel website - share this page and let people know that this project exists and I need your help. </li>
<li>
<strong>Talk about the project!</strong> If you have a travel podcast, I'd LOVE it if you talked about the project and shared the love with your followers!</li>
<li>If you know local associations, community-based tourism networks, bloggers or creative people in one or more of the countries I visit, <strong>please share your address book with me!</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Share, share, share.</strong> If in doubt, share once more.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thank you in advance for all of your help and encouragement! </strong></p>
<p>To address the elephant in the room - yes, there is no compensation for me in here. Everything up to 3500€ will be used to cover the costs mentioned above.</p>
<h3><strong>So, what happens in case I don't hit the funding goal?</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>What if I surpass the target? </strong></h3>
<p>The target is 3500€. Every little bit helps! If the goal is not reached, I plan however to take whatever is raised and put it towards advancing the project because I believe wholeheartedly in creating something inspiring for  responsible travelers of tomorrow and will continue to do that in whatever way I can.</p>
<p>It is possible you have chances of knowing someone who loves photography and the idea of deep connection with local communities when traveling and might be looking for something exactly like this.</p>
<p>If we reach our objective of course <strong>it's high-fives all around!</strong> Follow along, and become a part of the journey!</p>
<p>If I can raise more than 3500€, then I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy an additional external hard disk in order to secure more all the work and an additional portable charger</li>
<li>Pay a professional video-maker to create an even better web-documentary</li>
<li>Think about creating a photozine with my best shots or about holding a photography exhibition (another dream of mine!).</li>
</ul>

<p>Mi chiamo Florence, nata e cresciuta nella bellissima Firenze. Vivo a Parigi da cinque anni; prima di stabilirmi in Francia, ho visitato 20 paesi tra il 2004 e il 2011.<br/>Sono la redattrice e la fotografa del blog <i>FlorenceOutLoud.com</i> che sarà lanciato prestissimo !<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488922055/biph6dhbi1ezzomk8gr1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3><strong>Cosa è <i>FlorenceOutLoud.com</i>?</strong></h3>
<p><br/>In poche parole, Florence Out Loud è: <br/>- un <strong>blogzine</strong> (un misto tra il blog e la rivista online), dove troverete diverse categorie che potrebbero interessarvi: fotografia, video, narrazione (storytelling).... Perché dovreste visitare il blog? È un spazio sfaccettato dove trovare articoli sul viaggio responsabile, sull’ ecoturismo, su un modo di vita più consapevole, riflessioni su uno stile di vita libero dalla plastica e senza rifiuti, storie e ritratti di persone da tutto il mondo;</p>
<p>- una <strong>mappatura</strong> delle strutture ricettive eco-responsabili esistenti, degli operatori turistici e degli indirizzi di turismo comunitario, per aiutarvi a scegliere i professionisti del turismo da contattare per il vostro prossimo viaggio in solitario / in coppia, la vostra prossima vacanza con la  famiglia o con gli amici, e così via...<br/><br/>- un <strong>web-documentario</strong> interattivo dove raggrupperò fotografie, video, suoni ed interviste come se foste in viaggio con me (lo creerò con l’applicazione Klynt / klynt.net)</p>
<p>Scoprite tutte le potenzialità  di Klynt qui: <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/59979665"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://player.vimeo.com/video/59979665</a></p>

<h3>Perché questo progetto? Perché ora?</h3>
<p>Come molte altre persone ho deciso che il 2017 sarebbe stato l'anno dei grandi cambiamenti nella mia vita, che voglio vivere secondo le mie regole!</p>
<p>Dopo una grande esperienza la scorsa estate in Malesia e a Singapore, ho deciso di prendere un po 'di tempo per esplorare le meraviglie del mondo e ho comprato un biglietto aereo per fare il giro del mondo.</p>
<p>Anche se ho apprezzato quel viaggio, in qualche modo ho sentito la mancanza di un contatto più lungo con la popolazione locale,così che ho iniziato a cercare su internet come fare esperienze migliori nei viaggi!</p>
<p>Mi sono imbattuta in un sacco di siti web sul turismo comunitario, sul  turismo responsabile e così via. Ma le fonti erano molteplici, così ho pensato: forse potrebbe essere utile raggruppare tutte le informazioni su internet in un unico spazio e aggiungervi le storie di tutti quegli uomini e quelle donne che hanno avuto benefici dal turismo responsabile?</p>
<p>Un ultimo punto ma non meno importante, le Nazioni Unite hanno designato il 2017 come l’Anno Internazionale del turismo sostenibile per lo sviluppo, dimostrando che il turismo può essere una vera misura di « empowerment » per le comunità locali e per la lotta contro la povertà e l'esclusione sociale, uno strumento di promozione della diversità culturale e di solidarietà reciproca tra i popoli.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488922351/rf3dntfanfyhvl2yfhns.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Lo scopo del mio blog è quello di mostrare semplicemente che, vicino o lontano, chiunque può e deve essere un viaggiatore e un cittadino responsabile  semplicemente facendo scelte consapevoli.</strong></p>

<h3>Perché ho bisogno di IndieGoGo?</h3>
<p>E qui tocca  a voi!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Altri modi per aiutarmi</h3>
<p>Se non siete interessati a una qualsiasi delle ricompense o non sono riuscita fino ad ora a  convincervi a fare una donazione, ci sarebbero altri modi per aiutarmi!</p>
<p>• <strong>Donate!</strong> Se volete sostenere il progetto senza ricevere una ricompensa, potete farlo cliccando su ""Back it"" e scegliere la somma della vostra donazione.</p>
<p>• <strong>Condividete!</strong> Sono sicura che conoscete un amico che conosce un amico e cosi via, che potrebbe essere interessato a sostenere questo progetto. Trasmettete loro il link della campagna, parlate del progetto e chiedete di sostenerlo!</p>
<p>• <strong>Condividete il progetto!</strong> Su Instagram, su Facebook, sul vostro sito web, nei commenti del vostro sito di viaggio preferito - Condividete il link della campagna e fate sapere che questo progetto esiste e che ho bisogno dell' aiuto di tutti. </p>
<p>• <strong>Parlate del progetto!</strong> Se avete un podcast di viaggio, sarebbe importante parlare del progetto e condividere l’interesse per il viaggio responsabile con i vostri ascoltatori!</p>
<p>• Conoscete delle associazioni locali, delle reti di turismo comunitario, dei blogger o delle persone creative nei paesi che visiterò? Se si',  <strong>condividete la vostra rubrica con me, mi sarà utile!</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Condividete, condividete, condividete.</strong> In caso di dubbio, condividete una volta di più.</p>
<h3><strong>Grazie in anticipo per tutto il vostro aiuto e incoraggiamento!</strong></h3>
<p>Per affrontare la questione dell’utilizzazione dei fondi : tutto fino a 3500€ verrà utilizzato per coprire i costi di cui sopra.</p>
<h3>Quindi, cosa succede nel caso in cui non riesco a raggiungere l'obiettivo di finanziamento?</h3>
<h3>Cosa succede se supero l'obiettivo? </h3>
<p>L'obiettivo è di 3500€. Ogni piccolo aiuto conta! Se l'obiettivo non viene raggiunto, ho intenzione di prendere tutto ciò che è stato raccolto e riversarlo per continuare il progetto. Credo con tutto il cuore nella creazione di qualcosa di stimolante per i viaggiatori responsabili di domani e continuerò a farlo in qualunque modo possibile.</p>
<p>È probabile che conoscete qualcuno che ama la fotografia e viaggiare in maniera più profonda  e potrebbe essere alla ricerca di qualcosa esattamente come questo.</p>
<p>Se l'obiettivo è raggiunto, naturalmente, <strong>give me five!</strong> (datemi il cinque!). Continuate a seguire il progetto, e diventatene una parte importante!</p>
<p>Se riesco a raccogliere più di 3500 €, allora ecco cosa farò:</p>
<p>• acquistare un disco rigido esterno aggiuntivo (per salvare ancora meglio tutto il lavoro) e una batteria aggiuntiva</p>
<p>• assumere un realizzatore video professionista per creare un web-documentario ancora migliore</p>
<p>• pensare a creare un libro fotografico con i miei migliori scatti o organizzare una mostra fotografica (un altro mio sogno!).</p>
<p><strong>Sia finanziario che morale, il vostro supporto significa molto per me!</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Qui suis-je?</strong></h3> <p>Je m'appelle Florence, moitié italienne, moitié nigériane, née à Florence, en Italie. Je vis à Paris depuis cinq ans. Avant de m'installer en France, j'ai visité 20 pays entre 2004 et 2011. Je suis l'écrivain et la photographe derrière le blogzine <i>FlorenceOutLoud.com</i> que sera lancé très prochainement ;)</p>

<h3>Qu’est-ce Florence Out Loud ?</h3> <p>En un mot, Florence Out Loud est:</p>
<p>- un <strong>blogzine</strong>, où vous trouverez différentes catégories qui pourraient vous intéresser: la photographie, la vidéo,  le récit de voyage, .... Pourquoi avons-nous à choisir, non? C'est un espace à multiples facettes où vous trouverez également des articles sur le voyage responsable, l'écotourisme, des réflexions sur une vie zero déchets, les histoires et les portraits des habitants du monde entier ...</p>
<p>- une <strong>cartographie</strong> des hébergements responsables, des adresses de tourisme communautaire basés partout dans le monde, pour vous aider à choisir les professionnels du tourisme à contacter pour votre prochain voyage en solo / en couple, vacances en famille, voyage d'amis ...</p>
<p>- un <strong>documentaire web interactif</strong> où je rassemblerai des photographies, des vidéos, des sons et des interviews; ce sera comme si vous étiez avec moi dans ce voyage (créé avec Klynt App / klynt.net)</p>
<p>Découvrez le potentiel de l'application Klynt ici: <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/59979665"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://player.vimeo.com/video/59979665</a></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489328778/jlpwtsmezf1th3eopwgh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Pourquoi ce projet? Pourquoi maintenant?</h3> <p>Comme beaucoup d'autres, j'ai décidé que 2017 sera l'année de grands changements dans ma vie! Après une grande expérience l'été dernier en Malaisie et à Singapour, j'ai décidé de prendre un peu de temps pour explorer les merveilles du monde et j'ai acheté un billet tour du monde.</p>
<p>Même si j'ai vraiment apprécié ce voyage, j'ai, d'une certaine façon, senti d'être rentrée peu en  contact avec les locaux, c'est pourquoi j'ai commencé à chercher comment je pouvais maximiser l'impact positif de mon voyage et minimiser celui négatif. </p>
<p>J'ai trouvé beaucoup de sites internet sur le tourisme communautaire, les voyages responsables et ainsi de suite. Mais les sources étaient multiples, alors j'ai pensé: peut-être pourrait-il être utile de rassembler toutes les informations disponibles sur le net dans un seul espace et d'ajouter les histoires des femmes et des hommes qui pourraient bénéficier véritablement du tourisme responsable ?</p>
<p>Enfin, l'Organisation des Nations Unies a désigné 2017 comme l'Année internationale du Tourisme Durable pour le Développement, démontrant que le tourisme peut être une véritable mesure d'autonomisation des communautés locales et de lutte contre la pauvreté et l'exclusion sociale, favorisant la compréhension interculturelle et la solidarité mutuelle entre les peuples.</p>

<p><strong>Le but du blogzine est de simplement montrer que, de près ou de loin, n'importe qui peut et doit être un(e) voyageur(euse) et un(e) citoyen(ne) responsable juste en faisant des choix conscients.</strong></p>

<h3>Pourquoi ai-je besoin d'IndieGoGo?</h3>
<p>Et voilà où vous pouvez m'aider!</p>
<p>Bien sûr, même si j'ai déjà couvert une grande partie des coûts pour le projet, j'ai encore besoin de votre aide pour obtenir mon compagnon d'aventures: je devrais mettre à jour mon appareil photo actuel et en acheter un nouveau léger, discret et assez performant pour capturer toutes les histoires les plus inspirantes ! De plus, je devrai payer la licence pour utiliser l'application Klynt et le pack Adobe Creative pour les photographes (qui comprend Photoshop et Lightroom).</p>
<p>Une partie de mon budget doit couvrir les productions des contreparties, les frais d’Indiegogo et les frais bancaires.</p>

Who am I?
My name is Florence, half Italian, half Nigerian, born and raised in Florence, Italy. For the past five years I have been living in Paris. Before settling down in France, I have visited 20 countries between 2004 and 2011. I am the editor and photographer behind Florence Out Loud blogzine-to-be ;)




In a nutshell, Florence Out Loud is:
- a blogzine, where you will find different categories of articles of interest: photography, video, storytelling,.... Why have we to choose, right? It is a multi-faceted space where you can find articles about responsible travelling, ecotourism, conscious lifestyle, free-plastic life reflections, stories and portraits from all around the world…
- a mapping of existing eco, responsible accommodations, travel operators and community-based tourism addresses all around the world, to help you choose the tourism professionals to contact for your next solo/couple travel, family vacation, friends trip, and so on…
- an interactive web-documentary where I will gather photographs, videos, sounds and interviews like you were with me in the journey  (created with Klynt App/ klynt.net)
Discover the potential of Klynt application here:  https://player.vimeo.com/video/59979665

Why this project? Why now?
Like many others I decided that 2017 will be the year of great changes in my life and I committed myself to start living my life on my own terms!
After a great experience last summer in Malaysia and Singapore, I decided to take some time to explore the other world’s wonders and bought a Round-The-World ticket.
Even if I really appreciated that trip, I somehow feel that I missed a bit the contact with local people. That’s why I started to search how to maximize the positive impact and minimize the negative one of travelling!
 I came across a lot of websites about community-based tourism, responsible travel and so on but sources were multiple. I therefore thought that maybe it coul be useful to assemble all information available on the net in one space, adding stories from people who obtained benefits from responsible travelling. 
Last but not least, United Nations has designated 2017 as International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, proving that tourism can be a real measure of empowerment for local communities able to fight poverty and social exclusion, fostering cross-cultural understanding and mutual solidarity among people. 

The purpose of the blogzine is simply to show that, near or far, anyone can and should be a responsible traveller and citizen capable of making conscious choices.

Why do I need IndieGoGo?
And here is where you can help me out!
Of course, while I have already have covered many of the costs for the project, I still need your help to get my companion of adventures: I would need to update my photo gear buying a new camera, light, discreet and performing enough, to better capture all inspiring stories! Moreover I will need to pay the license to use the Klynt App and the Adobe Creative pack for photographers (including Photoshop and Lightroom).
A part of my budget has to cover the productions of the perks + Indiegogo fee and bank charges. 


Funds raised as a part of this campaign will cover:

Purchasing the camera (2200€)
Purchasing the Adobe Creative Cloud for photographers (144€)
Purchasing the Klynt App license (499€)
Perks shipping and distribution (+/-500€)
Campaign costs (Indiegogo fees and credit card fees) (+/-175€)


Key Stops of my Round-The-World journey:
- Mexico/ Yucatan peninsula (April-May)
- Guatemala (May)
- Costa Rica (May-June)
- Colombia (June)
- Ecuador (June)
- Chile (July)
- Argentina (July-August)
- Australia (August-October)
- Indonesia (October)
- Cambodia (October-November)
- Vietnam (November-December)
- Laos (December)
- Myanmar (December- January)

 

The journey already started! Follow along via social networks:
- Facebook page of the blogzine: https://www.facebook.com/FlorenceOutLoud/
- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/florence_3f
 
After the Round-The-World, what will happen?
Once at home, I will spend the end of January and February 2018, creating the interactive platform via Klynt App, editing all good pictures and making videos… I will also be pleased to attend informal meetings and events with interested fellow travellers in Paris.
Timeline of the project
- March/April : start of Indiegogo campaign

Other ways you can help
If you are not interested in any of the rewards and I couldn't convince you to give it a try until now, there are still a few ways you can help me!


Donate! If you'd like to support me without claiming a reward, you can do that as well! Simply click on ""Back it"" and you can put in any amount you'd like to donate. 

Spread the love for photography and responsible travel! I am sure you know a friend that knows a friend of friends (LOL!!!) that you think would be interested in supporting this project. Forward them this website, tell them all about me and ask them to back the project! 

Post about it! On Instagram, on Facebook, on your website, in the comments of your favourite travel website - share this page and let people know that this project exists and I need your help. 

Talk about the project! If you have a travel podcast, I'd LOVE it if you talked about the project and shared the love with your followers!
If you know local associations, community-based tourism networks, bloggers or creative people in one or more of the countries I visit, please share your address book with me!


Share, share, share. If in doubt, share once more.

Thank you in advance for all of your help and encouragement! 
To address the elephant in the room - yes, there is no compensation for me in here. Everything up to 3500€ will be used to cover the costs mentioned above.
So, what happens in case I don't hit the funding goal?
What if I surpass the target? 
The target is 3500€. Every little bit helps! If the goal is not reached, I plan however to take whatever is raised and put it towards advancing the project because I believe wholeheartedly in creating something inspiring for  responsible travelers of tomorrow and will continue to do that in whatever way I can.
It is possible you have chances of knowing someone who loves photography and the idea of deep connection with local communities when traveling and might be looking for something exactly like this.
If we reach our objective of course it's high-fives all around! Follow along, and become a part of the journey!
If I can raise more than 3500€, then I will:

Buy an additional external hard disk in order to secure more all the work and an additional portable charger
Pay a professional video-maker to create an even better web-documentary
Think about creating a photozine with my best shots or about holding a photography exhibition (another dream of mine!).

Whether it is financial or moral, your support means the world to me!

Mi chiamo Florence, nata e cresciuta nella bellissima Firenze. Vivo a Parigi da cinque anni; prima di stabilirmi in Francia, ho visitato 20 paesi tra il 2004 e il 2011.Sono la redattrice e la fotografa del blog FlorenceOutLoud.com che sarà lanciato prestissimo !

 
Cosa è FlorenceOutLoud.com?
In poche parole, Florence Out Loud è: - un blogzine (un misto tra il blog e la rivista online), dove troverete diverse categorie che potrebbero interessarvi: fotografia, video, narrazione (storytelling).... Perché dovreste visitare il blog? È un spazio sfaccettato dove trovare articoli sul viaggio responsabile, sull’ ecoturismo, su un modo di vita più consapevole, riflessioni su uno stile di vita libero dalla plastica e senza rifiuti, storie e ritratti di persone da tutto il mondo;
- una mappatura delle strutture ricettive eco-responsabili esistenti, degli operatori turistici e degli indirizzi di turismo comunitario, per aiutarvi a scegliere i professionisti del turismo da contattare per il vostro prossimo viaggio in solitario / in coppia, la vostra prossima vacanza con la  famiglia o con gli amici, e così via...- un web-documentario interattivo dove raggrupperò fotografie, video, suoni ed interviste come se foste in viaggio con me (lo creerò con l’applicazione Klynt / klynt.net)
Scoprite tutte le potenzialità  di Klynt qui: https://player.vimeo.com/video/59979665

Perché questo progetto? Perché ora?
Come molte altre persone ho deciso che il 2017 sarebbe stato l'anno dei grandi cambiamenti nella mia vita, che voglio vivere secondo le mie regole!
Dopo una grande esperienza la scorsa estate in Malesia e a Singapore, ho deciso di prendere un po 'di tempo per esplorare le meraviglie del mondo e ho comprato un biglietto aereo per fare il giro del mondo.
Anche se ho apprezzato quel viaggio, in qualche modo ho sentito la mancanza di un contatto più lungo con la popolazione locale,così che ho iniziato a cercare su internet come fare esperienze migliori nei viaggi!
Mi sono imbattuta in un sacco di siti web sul turismo comunitario, sul  turismo responsabile e così via. Ma le fonti erano molteplici, così ho pensato: forse potrebbe essere utile raggruppare tutte le informazioni su internet in un unico spazio e aggiungervi le storie di tutti quegli uomini e quelle donne che hanno avuto benefici dal turismo responsabile?
Un ultimo punto ma non meno importante, le Nazioni Unite hanno designato il 2017 come l’Anno Internazionale del turismo sostenibile per lo sviluppo, dimostrando che il turismo può essere una vera misura di « empowerment » per le comunità locali e per la lotta contro la povertà e l'esclusione sociale, uno strumento di promozione della diversità culturale e di solidarietà reciproca tra i popoli.

Lo scopo del mio blog è quello di mostrare semplicemente che, vicino o lontano, chiunque può e deve essere un viaggiatore e un cittadino responsabile  semplicemente facendo scelte consapevoli.

Perché ho bisogno di IndieGoGo?
E qui tocca  a voi!
Naturalmente, ho già coperto molti dei costi per realizzare il mio viaggio, ma ho ancora bisogno del vostro aiuto per acquistare il mio compagno di viaggio: una macchina fotografica leggera, discreta e performante, per catturare le storie più stimolanti e i momenti migliori della mia avventura! Inoltre ho bisogno di pagare la licenza per utilizzare l'applicazione Klynt e il pacchetto creativo di Adobe per i fotografi (che include Photoshop e Lightroom).
Una parte del mio budget deve coprire la creazione delle ricompense e delle commissioni Indiegogo.
Dettaglio dei costi

I fondi raccolti per questa campagna copriranno:
• l'acquisto della fotocamera (2200€)
• l'acquisto di Adobe Creative Cloud per i fotografi (144€)
• l'acquisto della licenza dell’ applicazione Klynt (499€)
• la distribuzione delle ricompense (+/-500€)
• i costi della campagna (tasse di IndieGoGo e commissioni carta di credito) (+/-175€)

Che cosa accadrà dopo il giro del mondo?

Per affrontare la questione dell’utilizzazione dei fondi : tutto fino a 3500€ verrà utilizzato per coprire i costi di cui sopra.
Quindi, cosa succede nel caso in cui non riesco a raggiungere l'obiettivo di finanziamento?
Cosa succede se supero l'obiettivo? 
L'obiettivo è di 3500€. Ogni piccolo aiuto conta! Se l'obiettivo non viene raggiunto, ho intenzione di prendere tutto ciò che è stato raccolto e riversarlo per continuare il progetto. Credo con tutto il cuore nella creazione di qualcosa di stimolante per i viaggiatori responsabili di domani e continuerò a farlo in qualunque modo possibile.
È probabile che conoscete qualcuno che ama la fotografia e viaggiare in maniera più profonda  e potrebbe essere alla ricerca di qualcosa esattamente come questo.
Se l'obiettivo è raggiunto, naturalmente, give me five! (datemi il cinque!). Continuate a seguire il progetto, e diventatene una parte importante!
Se riesco a raccogliere più di 3500 €, allora ecco cosa farò:
• acquistare un disco rigido esterno aggiuntivo (per salvare ancora meglio tutto il lavoro) e una batteria aggiuntiva
• assumere un realizzatore video professionista per creare un web-documentario ancora migliore
• pensare a creare un libro fotografico con i miei migliori scatti o organizzare una mostra fotografica (un altro mio sogno!).
Sia finanziario che morale, il vostro supporto significa molto per me!

Qui suis-je? Je m'appelle Florence, moitié italienne, moitié nigériane, née à Florence, en Italie. Je vis à Paris depuis cinq ans. Avant de m'installer en France, j'ai visité 20 pays entre 2004 et 2011. Je suis l'écrivain et la photographe derrière le blogzine FlorenceOutLoud.com que sera lancé très prochainement ;)


 
Qu’est-ce Florence Out Loud ? En un mot, Florence Out Loud est:
- un blogzine, où vous trouverez différentes catégories qui pourraient vous intéresser: la photographie, la vidéo,  le récit de voyage, .... Pourquoi avons-nous à choisir, non? C'est un espace à multiples facettes où vous trouverez également des articles sur le voyage responsable, l'écotourisme, des réflexions sur une vie zero déchets, les histoires et les portraits des habitants du monde entier ...
- une cartographie des hébergements responsables, des adresses de tourisme communautaire basés partout dans le monde, pour vous aider à choisir les professionnels du tourisme à contacter pour votre prochain voyage en solo / en couple, vacances en famille, voyage d'amis ...
- un documentaire web interactif où je rassemblerai des photographies, des vidéos, des sons et des interviews; ce sera comme si vous étiez avec moi dans ce voyage (créé avec Klynt App / klynt.net)
Découvrez le potentiel de l'application Klynt ici: https://player.vimeo.com/video/59979665

Pourquoi ce projet? Pourquoi maintenant? Comme beaucoup d'autres, j'ai décidé que 2017 sera l'année de grands changements dans ma vie! Après une grande expérience l'été dernier en Malaisie et à Singapour, j'ai décidé de prendre un peu de temps pour explorer les merveilles du monde et j'ai acheté un billet tour du monde.
Même si j'ai vraiment apprécié ce voyage, j'ai, d'une certaine façon, senti d'être rentrée peu en  contact avec les locaux, c'est pourquoi j'ai commencé à chercher comment je pouvais maximiser l'impact positif de mon voyage et minimiser celui négatif. 
J'ai trouvé beaucoup de sites internet sur le tourisme communautaire, les voyages responsables et ainsi de suite. Mais les sources étaient multiples, alors j'ai pensé: peut-être pourrait-il être utile de rassembler toutes les informations disponibles sur le net dans un seul espace et d'ajouter les histoires des femmes et des hommes qui pourraient bénéficier véritablement du tourisme responsable ?
Enfin, l'Organisation des Nations Unies a désigné 2017 comme l'Année internationale du Tourisme Durable pour le Développement, démontrant que le tourisme peut être une véritable mesure d'autonomisation des communautés locales et de lutte contre la pauvreté et l'exclusion sociale, favorisant la compréhension interculturelle et la solidarité mutuelle entre les peuples.

Le but du blogzine est de simplement montrer que, de près ou de loin, n'importe qui peut et doit être un(e) voyageur(euse) et un(e) citoyen(ne) responsable juste en faisant des choix conscients.

 
Pourquoi ai-je besoin d'IndieGoGo?
Et voilà où vous pouvez m'aider!
Bien sûr, même si j'ai déjà couvert une grande partie des coûts pour le projet, j'ai encore besoin de votre aide pour obtenir mon compagnon d'aventures: je devrais mettre à jour mon appareil photo actuel et en acheter un nouveau léger, discret et assez performant pour capturer toutes les histoires les plus inspirantes ! De plus, je devrai payer la licence pour utiliser l'application Klynt et le pack Adobe Creative pour les photographes (qui comprend Photoshop et Lightroom).
Une partie de mon budget doit couvrir les productions des contreparties, les frais d’Indiegogo et les frais bancaires.


 
Les fonds recueillis dans le cadre de cette campagne permettront:

d'acheter l’appareil photo (2200 €)
d'acheter le pack Adobe Creative Cloud pour les photographes (144 €)
d'acheter la licence Klynt App (499 €)
de livrer vos contreparties (+/- 500 €)
de couvrir le coûts de campagne (Indiegogo et frais de carte de crédit) (+/- 175 €)

D'autres façons dont vous pouvez m’aider Si vous n'êtes pas intéressé(e)s par aucune des contreparties ou je n’ai pas réussi à vous convaincre de me suivre dans ce projet,  vous pouvez toujours m’aider de différentes manières !


Faire un don ! Si vous souhaitez me soutenir sans contrepartie, vous pouvez le faire aussi ! Il suffit de cliquer sur «Back it» et vous pouvez choisir le montant que vous souhaitez.

Diffuser l'intérêt pour la photographie et le voyage responsable ! Je suis sûre que vous connaissez un ami qui connaît un ami (LOL !!!) qui serait intéressé à soutenir ce projet. Parlez leur de cette campagne et demandez leur de soutenir le projet !

Poster sur le projet ! Sur Instagram, sur Facebook, sur votre site web, dans les commentaires de votre site de voyage préféré - partagez cette page et faites savoir que ce projet existe.

Parler du projet ! Si vous avez un podcast de voyage, j’adorerais que vous parliez du projet et que vous le partagiez avec vos auditeurs !
Connaissez-vous des associations locales, des réseaux de tourisme communautaire, des blogueurs ou des personnes créatives dans un ou plusieurs des pays que je visite, n'hésitez pas à partager votre carnet d'adresses avec moi ! Il me sera très utile !!!
Partager, partager, partager. En cas de doute, partagez encore une fois !

Merci d'avance pour toute votre aide et votre encouragement !
Pour répondre à la question de l’utilisation des fonds, tout jusqu'à 3500€ sera utilisé pour couvrir les coûts mentionnés ci-dessus.
Alors, que se passe-t-il si je ne touche pas l'objectif ?
Et si je le dépasse ? L'objectif est de 3500€. Chaque petit geste compte ! Si l'objectif n'est pas atteint, je prévois de mettre tout ce qui aura été récolté entièrement au profit de ce projet. Je crois sincèrement pouvoir créer quelque chose d'inspirant pour les voyageurs responsables de demain et je continuerai à le faire de la façon dont je peux.
Il y a des chances pour que vous connaissiez des personnes qui aiment la photographie et l’idée de partage et de connexion étroite avec les communautés locales en voyageant, et qui seraient à la recherche d’un blog comme celui-ci.
Si l'objectif est atteint, alors bien sûr give me five! Continuez à suivre le projet et à prendre part à l’aventure!
Si je peux atteindre plus de 3500€, alors je vais:

Acheter un disque dur externe supplémentaire afin de mieux sécuriser tout le travail et un chargeur portable supplémentaire
Payer un vidéo-maker professionnel pour créer un web-documentaire encore meilleur
Penser à créer un photozine avec mes meilleurs photos ou à organiser une exposition de photographies (un autre de mes rêves !).

Que ce soit financier ou moral, votre soutien c'est très important pour moi !
Restons en contact !

<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Aura! I'm an actor and writer who has also worked In podcasting and radio for over a decade.  I'm passionate about the medium of audio to create new and exciting experiences and tell stories that don't normally make it into the mainstream. I was one of the first people to bring an independent arts and entertainment podcast to New Orleans when I launched Backstage on the Bayou back in 2009. At the time, there wasn't anything quite like it locally.  After that, I went on to contribute to special one-off projects like the Audio Filé for Nola Defender and The Sticky for Dirty Coast. I would later go on to volunteer at Clocktower Radio in New York City and consults on various other podcasts. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In NYC, people always wanted to know what ""life in the Big Easy"" was like. I told them it was more like the Small Complicated. When I moved back home this spring, I realized most of our regular conversations here are about the ridiculous circumstances that happen when we're just trying to do normal things.</span></p>
<p>On each episode of the podcast, you'll hear a Small Complicated story from a local or former local New Orleanian. We keep it real and we keep it really weird. </p>
<p>Our inaugural season will include 6 episodes. If people like it enough, hopefully it will become an ongoing series! <br/> </p>

<p>It's a universal truth, known for thousands of years – each and every story happens in our mind. From the bedtime stories to the modern audio books – they are all designed to trigger our imagination. Nothing is as powerful as our imagination.</p>
<p>Beyond Your Eyes is the first ever real audio series platform, powered by immersive cinema sound and designed to bring the cinema surround dynamics to your headphones. It combines the magic of a film with the power of a book and it aims to provide a whole new experience to the visually impaired as well.</p>
<p>The idea for “audio movie” was born years ago when Dimitar - our lead sound designer, who also happens to be a dire fan of Manowar, heard the everlasting ""The Warriors Prayer"". It inspired him to start making different audio scenes, using immersive sound, designed for regular headphones. The tipping point of the idea though, came when our whole team attended the premiere of a movie, whose post production was done by our studio. There was this blind man at the cinema, who had decided to enjoy the magic of the film, although unable to actually see it. We didn’t know if he was comfortable or how much he enjoyed it (We hoped he did) but we said to ourselves, what if we could improve this emotion and bring it into his own house?</p>
<p>Now, many restless nights later, having achieved the result and seeing the reaction of everyone who listens to it we’ve decided to create a platform for the first-ever real audio series (in immersive cinema sound for headphones) that is also optimized for visually impaired.</p>
<p>Beyond Your Eyes will push the boundaries of your imagination one step further. It will challenge it and charge it in a way you’ve never felt before. We invite you to take a leap of faith, put your headphones on and experience the sensation for yourself with the trailer of our first audio series “Into The Dark”.  </p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>“BYE” is not a name, chosen by chance – we want to say BYE to conventional entertainment content and say HELLO to a brand new experience that will test the limits of our fantasy. BYE is created for busy people that are keen on series and movies, but don’t have enough time for watching them. You can listen while you are commuting, jogging or working out in the Gym, you can even enjoy it while you’re doing your daily job, or during your coffee break.</p>
<p>We took this project very seriously, because highly ambitious goals stay behind it:</p>
<p>· To take the next step in the entertainment business, offering brand new consumer experience.</p>
<p>· To create an extraordinary product, accessible for the visually impaired as well, that combines the magic of a film with the power of a book.</p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there are always risks &amp; challenges with creating and delivering something pioneering. We've minimized both by having the entire process in-house. We have both a wealth of knowledge and years of experience in the TV and cinema industry. As a result of our expertise, we have completed the “proof of concept” - the prototype of our product – the first ever audio series „Into the Dark” and we’ve set the timetable step by step towards our final goal – launching the Beyond Your Eyes platform - an app-based solution for audio series that is also optimized for the visually impaired. We took this project very seriously because it will create an opportunity for the visually impaired to enjoy this new sensation and to participate in the process of its creation, showing the world their talent and creativity.</p>

<h2>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>
<p><strong>Two Flat-Earthers Kidnap a Freemason</strong>, is a dark comedy about information, security, and freedom. We plan to deliver on exactly what the title promises. A satirical skewering of internet conspiracy culture and self-aggrandizing echo chambers. It's also a love story, a story about cats, and a story about family, but mostly its a story about how Two Flat-Earthers Kidnap a Freemason and that's only the beginning...  But with that being said, we are aware of the hateful places that these rabbit holes can sometimes lead and we want to assure everyone that we will not give voices of hate or intolerance any space in this production. </p>
<p>Two Flat Earthers Kidnap a Freemason, will be a limited series consisting of 10-12 episodes. </p>
<p>Casting for this project will begin sometime after the IGG Campaign is completed and our budget is set. </p>

<p>Our first podcast, <strong>The Subjective Truth</strong>, is an exploration of legacy and lineage through the lense of True Crime &amp; High Strangeness. Despite being our first foray into the Audio Fiction landscape, The Subjective Truth has proven to be a bit of a small-breakout indie hit and is closing in on 70K downloads as it approaches the one year anniversary of the show’s premiere in October.</p>
<p>Our second podcast,<strong> The One Stars</strong>, is a comedic look at the absurdity of One Star Reviews from “all across the multiverse.” The series advanced to the Second Round of The Austin Film Festival Fiction Podcast Script Competition. The One Stars premiered just a few months ago on July 2, 2020.   </p>

<h2>GOODIE GOODIES: Rewards</h2>
<p>We have a variety of rewards available at different levels to thank you for your support. From Merch to Zoom Watch Parties to Enamel Pins, Autographed Scripts, and Promotional Ads on the Show. </p>
<p><u><strong>$5 USD - THE TAPE MEASURE</strong></u><br/>At this tier, you'll be listed as a supporter on our website! You’ll get access to an exclusive discord for the show. And the show account will follow you on Twitter and shout you out so that everyone knows you helped make this happen! </p>
<p><strong><u>$10 USD - THE TROWEL</u></strong><br/>At this tier, you’ll receive all the rewards from the Tape Measure levels, along with a personalized video thank you from our production team and early access to the first two episodes of the series before they hit the public feed! </p>
<p><strong><u>$25 USD - THE BRICKS I</u></strong><br/>At this tier, you'll receive all the rewards from the Tape Measure and Trowel levels, an exclusive sticker based upon our show art, and a ticket to a ZOOM watch party where you’ll be able to <i>‘enjoy’ </i>a <i>‘way too long’ </i>youtube conspiracy video with our director Danyelle.  </p>
<p><u><strong>$25 USD - THE BRICKS II</strong></u><br/>At this exclusive tier, you'll receive all the rewards from the Tape Measure and Trowel levels, and 2 minutes of promotional AD space to promote your own creative project on Two Flat-Earthers Kidnap a Freemason! <i>(subject to approval)</i><br/><br/><i>(Selecting “The Bricks II” reward tier is the only way to receive the promo ad slot. The promo ad reward is not available on any other levels or as part of any higher rewards.)</i></p>
<p><strong><u>$50 USD - THE GAVEL</u></strong><br/>At this tier, you'll receive all the rewards from the Tape Measure and Trowel and The Bricks I levels, along with a limited edition Enamel Pin and a 3D Printed Collectible both based upon our show art. </p>

<p><strong><u>$250 USD - THE SQUARE AND COMPASS</u></strong><br/>Wow. You get it! At this tier, you'll receive all the rewards from the previous levels (<i>except for the promo ad slot</i>), along with having your name listed in all of the episode credits as an Associate Producer for the series. </p>
<h2>What We're Hoping to Get </h2>
<p>Our funding goal is to raise <strong>$4000</strong> to cover the production costs for the series. The jobs we're able to handle in-house will represent a smaller percentage than what's standard for the workload because we're not as worried as personally getting paid to make this project as much as we're hoping to be able to compensate the talented folks who collaborate with us on this series.<strong> So when you see only 15% is allotted for Writing, Editing, Sound Design, and Directing the project just know it's because those are the roles we'll be handling ourselves. </strong></p>
<p><u><strong>The 4K goal will split into:</strong></u></p>
<p><u><strong>55% </strong></u>for Voice Actors ($2200)<br/><u><strong>15% </strong></u>for Reward Fulfillment and RSS Feed ($600)<br/><u><strong>15% </strong></u>for the Writer, Director, Sound Designer, Editor [in-house] ($600) <br/><u><strong>10%</strong></u> for our Composer Bajio Alvarado ($400) <br/><u><strong>5% </strong></u>for IGG Hosting Fees ($200)</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we'll still split whatever we do raise along these same percentages. If we fall FAR below our goal more will be shifted away from our personal 15% to help cover our fees and maximize the compensation we're able to offer our collaborators. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Is this podcast important to the world? No, there's no possible way I can justify this show as being important to the world. But it is a fun story that might have the chance to be important or entertaining to a few folks around the world, and that's all I can ever ask of my art. Especially a project with a ridiculous name like, ""Two Flat-Earthers Kidnap a Freemason.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not able to help us monetarily we'd still love your help with getting the word out about this project and about this fundraising campaign. Nothing moves the needle like word-of-mouth so whether it's plugging us on Twitter, telling a friend, or kidnapping someone and forcing them to watch youtube videos about our campaign until they're convinced its a good idea, we'd love your help! </p>

$10 USD - THE TROWELAt this tier, you’ll receive all the rewards from the Tape Measure levels, along with a personalized video thank you from our production team and early access to the first two episodes of the series before they hit the public feed! 
$25 USD - THE BRICKS IAt this tier, you'll receive all the rewards from the Tape Measure and Trowel levels, an exclusive sticker based upon our show art, and a ticket to a ZOOM watch party where you’ll be able to ‘enjoy’ a ‘way too long’ youtube conspiracy video with our director Danyelle.  
$25 USD - THE BRICKS IIAt this exclusive tier, you'll receive all the rewards from the Tape Measure and Trowel levels, and 2 minutes of promotional AD space to promote your own creative project on Two Flat-Earthers Kidnap a Freemason! (subject to approval)(Selecting “The Bricks II” reward tier is the only way to receive the promo ad slot. The promo ad reward is not available on any other levels or as part of any higher rewards.)

$250 USD - THE SQUARE AND COMPASSWow. You get it! At this tier, you'll receive all the rewards from the previous levels (except for the promo ad slot), along with having your name listed in all of the episode credits as an Associate Producer for the series. 
What We're Hoping to Get 
Our funding goal is to raise $4000 to cover the production costs for the series. The jobs we're able to handle in-house will represent a smaller percentage than what's standard for the workload because we're not as worried as personally getting paid to make this project as much as we're hoping to be able to compensate the talented folks who collaborate with us on this series. So when you see only 15% is allotted for Writing, Editing, Sound Design, and Directing the project just know it's because those are the roles we'll be handling ourselves. 
The 4K goal will split into:
55% for Voice Actors ($2200)15% for Reward Fulfillment and RSS Feed ($600)15% for the Writer, Director, Sound Designer, Editor [in-house] ($600) 10% for our Composer Bajio Alvarado ($400) 5% for IGG Hosting Fees ($200)
If we don't reach our goal we'll still split whatever we do raise along these same percentages. If we fall FAR below our goal more will be shifted away from our personal 15% to help cover our fees and maximize the compensation we're able to offer our collaborators. 

The Impact
Is this podcast important to the world? No, there's no possible way I can justify this show as being important to the world. But it is a fun story that might have the chance to be important or entertaining to a few folks around the world, and that's all I can ever ask of my art. Especially a project with a ridiculous name like, ""Two Flat-Earthers Kidnap a Freemason.""

Other Ways You Can Help
If you're not able to help us monetarily we'd still love your help with getting the word out about this project and about this fundraising campaign. Nothing moves the needle like word-of-mouth so whether it's plugging us on Twitter, telling a friend, or kidnapping someone and forcing them to watch youtube videos about our campaign until they're convinced its a good idea, we'd love your help!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>We need you to make the Audio Verse Awards</h3>
<p>Since 2013, the Audio Verse Awards have worked tirelessly to bring together the Audio Fiction Community every year.</p>
<p>We run the AVAs out of pocket, operating at a loss, relying on unpaid volunteers to code the website, build the forms and spreadsheets, verify the validity of each submission, splice and upload the showcases episodes, and create graphics and certificates for winners. </p>
<p>We are incredibly thankful for all of the support we have received, but we need you to make the awards possible.</p>
<h3>What are the Audio Verse Awards?</h3>
<p>The Audio Verse Awards are an annual celebration, dedicated to the greatest people and productions in immersive audio fiction around the world, whether it's an audio play, improvised, or spoken word production.</p>
<p>Since 2013, we have opened every September to ask the Audio Fiction community for nominations, and to vote on who should be recognized.</p>
<p>Every award season we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open to ask the Community for Nominations. If we receive three identical nominations from different people, it proceeds to our list of nominees.</li>
<li>Request nominees to submit an episode for our curate nominees showcase, which we assemble and release for voter consideration.</li>
<li>Craft a preferential voting ballot for the community to rank nominees.</li>
<li>Tally and verify the votes to ensure fair results.</li>
<li>Recognize the winners in each of our categories.</li>
<li>Create graphics and certificates for the winners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these tasks occupies the members of our team every year from July until the end of the awards. Every year, we are blessedly swamped by the sheer amount of enthusiasm the community displays for storytelling in audio.</p>
<h3>Who is behind the Awards?</h3>
<p>The Audio Drama Awards is staffed by a board currently consisting of the following members and headed by a chairperson. They act as facilitators and take a scientific approach to our data. If a member of the team chooses to vote in the awards, it has the same weight as any other vote.</p>
<p>Our team consists of: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Landon Beall – Webmaster </strong>Landon sees value in a great story. And for him, the Audio Verse Awards are where great audio stories get the spotlight they deserve.</li>
<li>
<strong>Colin J. Kelly – Chair </strong>Colin’s first love is Audio Fiction, and loves talking about it, and what makes audio great.</li>
<li>
<strong>Alexandra Pal – Data Scientist</strong> Alexandra Pal can usually be found bringing cheer to anything she does, be it programming, drawing or just enjoying a good story.</li>
<li>
<strong>Erin Sellars – Nominee Showcase</strong> Erin truly loves audio fiction and can’t think of a better way to express that than by helping the amazing AVA team recognize the incredible work of the community.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dan Whitelaw – Graphic Design</strong> The most patient and professional graphic designer we could find, Dan is constantly improving and creating better graphics for the website, or other media things.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The AVAs are fully independent and autonomous. We do not run ads, nor do we charge the nominators, nominees, or voters in order to participate. In order to pay for hosting, the technical systems to ensure fair and preferential voting, not to mention compensating the people who are constantly working to make these awards are as great as they can be, we need your help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our hosting costs due to the number of visitors we receive.</li>
<li>Ranked voting and survey system to ensure fair and accurate voting.</li>
<li>Our graphic artist creates 40+ unique graphics.  </li>
<li>Our two data specialists overlook all data for accuracy and validity.</li>
<li>Our nominee showcase director communicates, assembles and schedules our podcast.</li>
<li>Our webmaster constantly fixes and optimizes our site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Raising $1,500 would allow us to fulfill those perks, and give us funds to keep the lights on, and pay each member of the team for four months worth of work. More than that, and we might be able to pay our people a living wage for their time and effort.</p>
<p>Supporting the Audio Verse Awards does not affect the results of the Audio Verse Awards, outside of enabling the awards to operate. We do have these perks to thank the people who support at the following levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any Amount, early access to our nomination form, which allows us to test our nomination automation system.</li>
<li>$5 Personal AVA Postcard</li>
<li>$10 AVA Sticker</li>
<li>$15 AVA Pin</li>
<li>$25 Personal AVA Postcard, Sticker, and Pin.</li>
<li>$40 AVA Unisex T-shirt</li>
<li>$50 Your chosen winner, which could be yourself, will receive a poster of their award certificate, thanks to you</li>
<li>$75 Your chosen winner, which could be yourself, will receive a framed poster of their award certificate, thanks to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>And each of those is available as individual add-ons perks</p>
<p>We've chosen those perks at a level of support which allows us to provide you a physical reward and raise funds for our operation while factoring in factors such as international shipping. We will fulfill all rewards after the conclusion of the Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<h3>Why are the Audio Verse Awards important?</h3>
<p>It is hard to create art, and harder still to give it value. By asking the community to take the time and consider what art they have heard, they collectively show what art connects with them. Art is an expression of human creative skill and imagination, and art which resonates has the greatest value. We simply do our best to measure the resonance of art in stories told through audio.</p>
<p>We are not juried awards. The members of our committee serve as facilitators, observing the results and working to ensure the results are fair and accurate. We are content creators and listeners; members of the audio fiction community ourselves. We operate democratically under a chair to observe, reflect and change based upon the community and feedback we receive.</p>
<p>Now in our seventh year, we have come back and done our best to build up this community. We are incredibly thankful for the help we have received along the way. We are proud of our part in helping to recognize the greatness we have been hearing. We love finding new favorites every year.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every year the same challenges present themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do put people and productions on an even playing field with their peers?</li>
<li>What ways are we hearing audio used to create art?</li>
<li>What artistic disciplines are audible to listeners?</li>
<li>Where can we improve to recognize and reflect our community better?</li>
<li>How do we make advancing in our awards show the value of our nominees and winners?</li>
</ul>
<p>The current awards are our solution to these questions and reflect our current philosophy.<br/><br/>The risk every year is that we can get this horribly wrong, that cheaters may manage to circumvent our methods, and that we could fail to reflect the community as best as we can. We are incredibly open to community feedback and change in response to the passion we find ourselves overwhelmed by every year.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is able to help us financially, which is why participation in these awards are free to everyone.</p>
<p>If you can take the time to share this, that helps us make the awards reach more listeners and creators so they can participate, in addition to helping us raise funds.</p>
<p>If you take the time to nominate a production, or person on a production, you help us recognize the art and artists for their work.</p>
<p>If you are able to vote on the ballot, each ranking you make gives a better picture of who is the greatest in immersive audio fiction.</p>
<p>If you find something new to listen to, please tell the show and tell us. Never forget the value of a kind word of support.</p>

<h3>Why <i>Magic of the Mind?</i>
</h3>
<p>The human brain is the most complex thing known to mankind. While there's still plenty of mysteries to be discovered, a multitude of fields are uncovering secrets every day. <i>Magic of the Mind </i>explores the science of the mind through a radical new lens: audio fantasy. </p>
<p><strong>Part 1: The Fantasy Story</strong></p>
<p>Each episode follows the story of Eve, a sixteen-year-old scribe traveling the Forgotten Realms of Dungeons and Dragons in search of a place to call home. Written into the plot of each episode is a different topic in cognitive science, that is explored in detail in Part 2.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: The Interview</strong></p>
<p>Released simultaneously with developments in the fantasy story are interviews with female scientists who study the topics explored in each episode. In the interviews, the writer explains the theories she wove into the narrative, and the scientists expand on what these look like in the real world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>This show was created as a way to help reconnect scientists and the citizens who actually fund scientific research. We're taking a different approach than most science education and communication outlets by making a story we think people will actively engage with, and using the power of narrative to amplify the excitement of scientific discovery. Not only are we trying to show the role science can play in everyday life, we're also trying to demonstrate the true nature of science, as an approach instead of a steadfast body of knowledge. </p>
<h3>What does my contribution do?</h3>
<p>On a fundamental level, your contribution expresses your support for a future where science is a dynamic process that is open to a larger number of people from a wider demographic. On a more pragmatic level, your contribution supports the people who are making this podcast possible. Between writing, editing, composing music, hiring voice actors, recording equipment, editing software, website hosting, and graphic design, it takes a village to run a show, and each person deserves to be paid for their time. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What else can I do?</h3>
<p>Sometimes it's easy to feel like we're creating in a vacuum. Reaching people who like what we're doing is truly why we do this! If you could share the podcast with others who you think might enjoy the show, that would make us feel truly fulfilled, like our work is really going somewhere. Any support you can give truly means the world to us, whether a donation or a kind word.</p>

<h3>Why sponsor D.R.E.A.M.?</h3>
<p>Thank you for considering supporting the D.R.E.A.M. team! D.R.E.A.M. is an audio drama podcast series about a group of young adults living together while participating in a study testing the effects of virtual reality on the human body and mind. The first season is already drafted and production is underway, but we need the help of generous donors like you with funding so we can bring the episodes to you! </p>
<p>We are also semifinalists and have reached the top 10 (top 2%!) in the Austin Film Festival's Fiction Podcast competition, which is an awesome accomplishment we're proud of and will hopefully help us reach a wider audience when production starts!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What Do We Need?</h3>
<p>We are asking for $1,000 in funding to cover our expenses such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating our website and social media accounts</li>
<li>Music, art, and sound production </li>
<li>Some of the sound equipment expenses</li>
</ul>
<p>$1,000 will be enough to help us begin production on season 1, after which we hope to increase our audience and be self-sustaining. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>The D.R.E.A.M. project (Disconnected Reality Exploration and Monitoring) is an experiment designed to test the human body’s ability to withstand prolonged exposure to virtual reality environments. It is run by a company called Visillico, which currently offers augmented reality workforce training programs. They have also released augmented reality games with some success. They have recently registered an exclusive patent on a new virtual reality technology and plan to develop fully virtual training programs to replace the augmented reality ones they currently offer, but are looking into the possibility of producing virtual reality simulations and games that would last longer than the usual thirty-minute simulations used in workforce training.</p> <p>D.R.E.A.M. researchers and representatives from their sponsors, including Whitmore Laboratories, a large pharmaceutical conglomerate, have selected four participants chosen for their eccentricities to participate in a six-month study measuring their mental and physical wellbeing after prolonged (upwards of two hours) exposure to virtual environments. The story follows those four participants and the researcher assigned to conduct interviews with them after each “dream,” or trip into the virtual realm programmed by Visillico. At first, the trips are short and relatively pleasant, but as time goes on, the dreams become more like nightmares. When sounds and images from dreams begin to leak into the real world, the subjects find themselves unable to escape their contracts and forced to continue as the line between reality and virtual reality becomes nothing but a dream itself.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Because the first season's scripts are drafted and recording is currently underway, the risks are minimal at this time.</p>
<p>If we do not meet our funding goals, our actors may not be able to purchase the necessary sound equipment to make the podcast a success. This could delay production considerably. In addition, there are always risks involved in the production of any audio drama, but we have taken measures to ensure we will complete the project within 3 seasons.</p>

<h3>Please Contribute to ""The Big Gay Roadtrip"" Part Deux</h3>
<p>My Name is Scott Fullerton.  As the Producer and Host of the ""Left of Str8 Show,"" I have been creating LIVE radio and podcasting to the LGBT Community and our Allies for almost 4 years now.  I have interviewed Celebrities, Personalities and Advocates in the areas of Entertainment, Foodies, Books, and Organizations, trying to inform, educate, and entertain my listeners and have some fun along the way.  I was the Chairman of the local Pride Center for 3 successful years and am a strong advocate of our Community.  The show was started as a hobby when I moved home to take care of my ailing dad, who has since passed away and I do the show in his honor ever since, with the small contribution he set aside for the show, while I now take care of my 80 year old mother.  </p>

<p>Last year I was invited to bring the show to the INNdulge Resort in Palm Springs, CA, to broadcast LIVE From the Resort for the month of August.  It was an amazing and literally HOT time had by all in the warm desert sun, getting to interview most of my favorite guests in person for the very first time, as opposed to the usual phone interviews with my guests calling in here to NE Ohio.  I have never tried to make any money for myself off my radio show and I paid all expenses last year to the Resort and back out of my own pocket.  I cannot afford to do that again this year and am asking for YOUR help.  Your contributions will assist primarily in helping me add a Third LIVE Show at the local Pride Center, where I can feature our favorite Ally and Women, who will need a separate hotel to stay in, as well as Gas Money, Lodging on the drive to the Resort in Palm Springs and back to NE Ohio, and meal and expenses while staying in Palm Springs.  I also will be trying to record the journey along the way, stopping in cities and exploring their LGBT presence and sharing it with my listeners.  I love bringing LGBT Personalities and Allies on the air and showing the strength of our Community from big cities to small.</p>

<li>This year I am hoping to defray at least $8,000 towards the trip, and spend a little on shining a light on LGBT life in the communities I am driving thru along the way.  In return, I am trying to offer some innovative and fun perks, including from some of the Celebrities and Personalities that have been on my radio show and may be LIVE in Palm Springs.</li>
<li>If I do not make the entire amount, each dollar raised will go towards the top priorities of gas and lodging for the round trip.  Any money raised above and beyond the Goal, will go towards LGBT non-profits I will highlight along the Roadtrip or in Palm Springs.</li>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>If you know anything about us, it's probably A: we are best frahnds, 2: we love Disney, and lastly: we have some THOUGHTS.</p>
<p>In an effort to feel like artists who are actually doing something between jobs, we've toyed around with the idea of our own podcast for a while now. After too much time talking about it, we have now decided to take the plunge and just make this thing, come what may. </p>
<p>So what is Poor Unfortunate Podcast? </p>
<p>It is a lovingly irreverent Disney comedy podcast. It seems like there is a podcast for everything these days. But what is lacking out there is a pod that shoots the shit about Disney in the way that we proud adult Disney lovers do. We plan to cover it all, the good and the bad. Popular opinions like the majesty of the New Fantasyland expansion in Disney World, and unpopular opinions like the train-wreck of a live-action remake that folks try to call ""Beauty and the Beast."" Each week, we will take any particular topic from the vast array of Disney material out there and alternate ranting and raving about them (in the most fun way possible).</p>
<h3>Hopes &amp; Dreams</h3>
<p>Our dream is to be invited to the media day ahead of the opening of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in Disney. Our more realistic goal is that we might encounter someone listening to the first five minutes of the podcast on a late night 2/3 train.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's what we need to get this podcast off the ground. We're not in the habit of wasting time or money so we are sticking to the basics for now. It's important to us that we are supporting other artists like us so our goal is to commission original music and artwork from independent artists. More specifically, this is what your donation will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microphones and Audio Equipment</li>
<li>Audio Mixing Software</li>
<li>Commissioning Original Artwork for our Logo Design </li>
<li>Commissioning Original Theme Music</li>
<li>Building and Maintaining our Website </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Ok, so Indiegogo wants us to put risks and challenges here that we may face but honestly we're golden. It's just smooth sailing ahead. No problems whatsoever. Except for like the fact that we've never done this before and are doing this on our own. So yeah. I guess the biggest risk is that we chicken out of doing this, but we already have the social media handles and whatnot so this would probably be a pretty safe investment on your part. :) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't find a couple bucks to contribute to this campaign, WE SO GET IT! As struggling artists ourselves we can appreciate that sometimes you gotta hang onto that cash for a slice of dollar pizza as your one meal of the day. If that's you, we'd so appreciate it if you can help out in these other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our Indiegogo campaign on social media! </li>
<li>Drop us a message of support so we don't feel like idiots pursuing a hopeless dream!</li>
<li>Listen to the Podcast when it comes out and share it with all your friends!</li>

<h3>What is #JEMsGuide?</h3>
<p><strong>The story behind Jason Everett Miller's Guide to Being HUMAN</strong> entailed costs I willingly paid, even though it negatively impacted those closest to me in numerous ways. I'm starting this journey as my heartfelt way of saying I'm sorry. Any errors, omissions or misunderstandings of thoughts and deeds are purely on me. <i>Mea culpa</i>!</p>
<p><a href=""https://jemsguide.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>#JEMsGuide</strong></a> is a multi-year, multimedia effort first focused on an autobiography I wrote for my soon-to-be newborn son in case I got hit by a bus, and then self-published on Amazon before pulling it off that platform recently as part of divesting from their services. They still haven’t removed it all the way, so I am reconnoitering instead.</p>
<p>Time to finish that written conversation with my son via a more fluid and tactile medium. Time to involve other voices and experiences for a fuller picture of <strong>what it means to be human in the 21st Century</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23JEMsGuideLIVE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">#JEMsGuide LIVE</a> are biweekly video podcasts streaming live on Facebook </strong>with final productions posted to Youtube a day later. Rinse and repeat until I’ve rewritten all 634 pages of the original manuscript into <i>Jason Everett Miller's Guide to Being HUMAN, <strong>Volume I – Midnight Son. </strong></i>A living, breathing document freely available on the Internet, though all donations are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Part spoken word of the three chapters being published for that episode, part manifesto on the chaotic nature of humans being, and every bit irreverent social media talk show with zero fucks to give and rather large axes to grind.</p>
<p><strong>#JEMsGuideLIVE airs every other Sunday at 2100, eastern</strong>, starting February 24, 2019. Second show is March 10, 2019, and so on. In between shows, I'll tape special Indiegogo supporter updates where I deliver all promised perks (some might say quirks) and continue the discussion in an unscripted form. <strong>The ""Supporter Perks &amp; Quirks"" show premieres March 3 at 2100, eastern, </strong>with my mom, my first Level 4 supporter!</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing this journey together. <i>Viva la Evolución!</i></p>
<h3>Pebbles in the Pond</h3>
<p>Every story has the chance to make an impact. That's where you come in. </p>
<ul>
<li>Ten years in the Navy as a broadcaster and photojournalist gives me the skills necessary to complete the mission I have laid out ahead.</li>
<li>As Earth transitions into whatever comes next, it's important for storytellers to focus their words on humanity's race toward extinction.</li>
<li>I hope to extend my creative runway by making #JEMsGuide a living, breathing entity supported by dreamers and realists alike. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a few bucks to donate and/or can share this campaign with your friends, any support you're inspired to give is greatly appreciated.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know not everyone has the funds to contribute, but every piece of mindshare and support creates a zeitgeist moment. Drastic and sustainable human change is possible with enough positive energy inputs turned toward the task.</p>

<h3><strong>Thanks so much for your love and support!</strong></h3>
</div></div>","What is #JEMsGuide?
The story behind Jason Everett Miller's Guide to Being HUMAN entailed costs I willingly paid, even though it negatively impacted those closest to me in numerous ways. I'm starting this journey as my heartfelt way of saying I'm sorry. Any errors, omissions or misunderstandings of thoughts and deeds are purely on me. Mea culpa!
#JEMsGuide is a multi-year, multimedia effort first focused on an autobiography I wrote for my soon-to-be newborn son in case I got hit by a bus, and then self-published on Amazon before pulling it off that platform recently as part of divesting from their services. They still haven’t removed it all the way, so I am reconnoitering instead.
Time to finish that written conversation with my son via a more fluid and tactile medium. Time to involve other voices and experiences for a fuller picture of what it means to be human in the 21st Century.
#JEMsGuide LIVE are biweekly video podcasts streaming live on Facebook with final productions posted to Youtube a day later. Rinse and repeat until I’ve rewritten all 634 pages of the original manuscript into Jason Everett Miller's Guide to Being HUMAN, Volume I – Midnight Son. A living, breathing document freely available on the Internet, though all donations are greatly appreciated.
Part spoken word of the three chapters being published for that episode, part manifesto on the chaotic nature of humans being, and every bit irreverent social media talk show with zero fucks to give and rather large axes to grind.
#JEMsGuideLIVE airs every other Sunday at 2100, eastern, starting February 24, 2019. Second show is March 10, 2019, and so on. In between shows, I'll tape special Indiegogo supporter updates where I deliver all promised perks (some might say quirks) and continue the discussion in an unscripted form. The ""Supporter Perks & Quirks"" show premieres March 3 at 2100, eastern, with my mom, my first Level 4 supporter!
I look forward to continuing this journey together. Viva la Evolución!
Pebbles in the Pond
Every story has the chance to make an impact. That's where you come in. 

Ten years in the Navy as a broadcaster and photojournalist gives me the skills necessary to complete the mission I have laid out ahead.
As Earth transitions into whatever comes next, it's important for storytellers to focus their words on humanity's race toward extinction.
I hope to extend my creative runway by making #JEMsGuide a living, breathing entity supported by dreamers and realists alike. 

If you have a few bucks to donate and/or can share this campaign with your friends, any support you're inspired to give is greatly appreciated.

Other Ways You Can Help
I know not everyone has the funds to contribute, but every piece of mindshare and support creates a zeitgeist moment. Drastic and sustainable human change is possible with enough positive energy inputs turned toward the task.

<h3>Operazione Hayk</h3>
<p>La leggenda narra che nel 2492 a.C. un mitico condottiero di nome Hayk unificò le tribù armene e le guidò in guerra contro gli invasori assiro-babilonesi comandati dal potente re Nimrod.</p>
<p>Gli Armeni riuscirono a sconfiggere gli eserciti nemici presso il lago di Van, e da allora quelle terre presero il nome di Hayots Dzor: la Valle degli Armeni.</p>
<p>A partire da quel momento nulla è stato facile per la nazione fondata da Hayk: gli Armeni dovettero affrontare 4500 anni di invasioni, massacri, genocidi e guerre, ma non si arresero mai.</p>
<p>Nonostante le avversità, gli Armeni prosperarono e svilupparono una cultura raffinata. Contribuirono allo sviluppo della scienza, della musica, della religione, della letteratura, del commercio e dell’arte in tutta l’Eurasia.</p>
<p>Oggi i figli di Hayk sono chiamati a superare una nuova sfida: il 27 settembre 2020 è riesplosa una vecchia guerra che li vede per l’ennesima volta contrapposti all’Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>La posta in palio di questo conflitto è un fazzoletto di terra chiamato Artsakh (ex Nagorno Karabakh), un piccolo stato etnicamente armeno che la comunità internazionale considera parte dell’Azerbaijan, ma che di fatto è sempre stato abitato dagli Armeni e che si autogoverna da quasi 30 anni.</p>
<p>I confini odierni dell’Artsakh vennero plasmati nel 1994 sul campo di battaglia al prezzo di 30.000 morti ed 1 milione di sfollati. La guerra vide gli Armeni trionfare sugli Azeri, ma la comunità internazionale non riuscì a negoziare efficacemente, ed i due contendenti non firmarono mai un trattato di pace definitivo.</p>
<p>Terminato il drammatico conflitto, gli Armeni dovettero fronteggiare una profonda crisi demografica ed economica dovuta al collasso del sistema sovietico ed alla conseguente deindustrializzazione, mentre l’economia azera iniziò a decollare grazie alle esportazioni di idrocarburi.</p>
<p>Sull’onda di questa pioggia di denaro, Baku si rifece il trucco: a ridosso della città vecchia spuntarono lussuosi centri commerciali ed imponenti grattacieli. Miliardi di dollari vennero riversati nello sport, nei grandi eventi, ed in qualsiasi cosa servisse a proiettare nel mondo l’immagine di un paese moderno, ricco e vincente.</p>
<p>La capitale azera cambiò faccia, ma presto emerse l’incongruenza tra la narrazione e la realtà: mentre gli Aliyev edificavano grattacieli scintillanti e sbandieravano i mirabolanti successi del nuovo Azerbaijan, milioni di cittadini vivevano sotto la soglia di povertà ed i livelli di produzione industriale restavano fermi dai tempi dell’URSS.</p>
<p>Come avviene in ogni dittatura, i soldi rimasero attaccati alle mani del presidente-padrone dell’Azerbaijan, ed al popolo rimasero solo le briciole. Presto emerse che la famiglia Aliyev si trovava al vertice di un torbido vortice corruttivo, e che spostava miliardi di dollari nei paradisi fiscali caraibici.</p>
<p>Il malcontento iniziò timidamente a serpeggiare tra la popolazione, ed il regime decise di affrontare il problema con metodi drastici: represse ogni forma di dissenso ed imbavagliò i media.</p>
<p>Fu probabilmente in questo frangente che il regime comprese la rinnovata importanza dell’irrisolto conflitto dell’Artsakh: la guerra offriva la possibilità di indirizzare le frustrazioni di milioni di cittadini verso un nemico esterno da additare a colpevole di ogni male.</p>
<p>Nacque così una propaganda martellante che mirava a disumanizzare gli Armeni ed insinuare un subdolo messaggio nella mente della popolazione: se non hai il pane, la colpa è degli Armeni che te l’hanno rubato. Se non hai una casa, la colpa è degli Armeni che ti hanno sottratto il Nagorno Karabakh.</p>
<p>Ma non basta la propaganda per fare una guerra, ed il regime lo sapeva bene. Il governo azero stanziò miliardi di dollari per rinnovare il suo arsenale bellico ed iniziò a fare shopping di aerei, elicotteri, missili a lungo raggio, droni ed artiglieria pesante in Russia, Israele, Turchia ed Italia.</p>
<p>L’Armenia non riuscì a tenere il passo della sfrenata corsa agli armamenti azera, ed in pochi anni i rapporti di forza tra i due eserciti si ribaltarono.</p>
<p>Così il 27 settembre, forte del suo grande potenziale bellico e sospinto dalle nuove ambizioni imperialiste della Turchia, l’Azerbaijan abbandonò definitivamente la strada della diplomazia e decise di concedere sfogo all’ormai incontenibile odio anti-Armeno che covava in patria.</p>
<p>L’esercito azero attaccò all’alba. Il fuoco dell’artiglieria iniziò a martellare incessantemente sulle postazioni nemiche e migliaia di uomini si scagliarono con forza contro le difese dell’Artsakh.</p>
<p>Le bombe giunsero più rapidamente delle notizie: i civili Armeni si svegliarono sotto i colpi dei droni, dei missili e dell’artiglieria azera. La capitale Stepanakert venne sventrata in pochi giorni, e lo scempio continua tuttora.</p>
<p>Da quel maledetto 27 settembre la guerra non si è più fermata: si combatte incessantemente lungo l’intero perimetro dell’Artsakh, mentre i missili continuano ad abbattersi sulle abitazioni dei civili e devastano la capitale.</p>
<p>Armeni ed Azeri, civili e militari, stanno morendo come mosche. Ma potrebbe andare anche peggio di così. I pochi specialisti focalizzati su questo conflitto, indifferentemente dalla loro posizione ideologica, concordano su un punto: se l’esercito armeno dovesse perdere il controllo dell’Artsakh, se centinaia di migliaia di civili Armeni dovessero finire nelle mani dell’esercito azero, si rischierebbero massicci episodi di pulizia etnica.</p>
<p>Mentre l’Occidente si compiace da tanti anni nel ripetere che certi orrori non potranno più accadere in Europa, una nuova grottesca riedizione del Genocidio Armeno si sta preconfigurando alle sue porte.</p>
<p>Nella sostanziale indifferenza del mondo, il popolo dell’Artsakh è strenuamente impegnato a perseguire un solo scopo: sopravvivere all’efferata aggressione azera.</p>
<p>Per contribuire ad infrangere il vergognoso silenzio dell’Europa, nell’ottobre 2020 ho deciso di lanciare un progetto divulgativo dal nome evocativo: Operazione Hayk.</p>
<p>In estrema sintesi, il fine ultimo dell’Operazione Hayk è quello di utilizzare i giornali, le radio ed i social network per far conoscere a migliaia di italiani la guerra dell’Artsakh, denunciare i crimini di guerra commessi dal regime azero e raccontare le drammatiche sfide che il popolo armeno sta affrontando nell’indifferenza dell’Occidente.</p>
<p>L’Operazione Hayk ambisce ad essere più di una semplice campagna mediatica: si prefigge l’obiettivo di contribuire a risvegliare gli italiani dal torpore e far arrivare nelle loro case la voce di un popolo martoriato ed ignorato.</p>
<p>Per dirlo con il più abusato degli ossimori, il silenzio dell’occidente è assordante, e noi vorremmo provare a romperlo.</p>
<p>Il silenzio è complice di questa carneficina. Noi non vogliamo esserlo.</p>

<h3>Raccolta fondi</h3>
<p>L’Operazione Hayk è un progetto che si basa totalmente sul lavoro offerto a titolo di volontariato da parte di Gianluca Alex Proietto e dei suoi collaboratori, ma non è esente da costi.</p>
<p>In primo luogo dovremo acquistare dell’equipaggiamento tecnico specifico che servirà a produrre e montare contenuti audio/video di buona qualità nel difficile contesto dell’Artsakh.</p>
<p>In seconda battuta, dovremo far fronte ad ingenti costi operativi: biglietti aerei, affitto delle basi operative, rimborso delle spese quotidiane dell’operatore sul posto (spostamenti, cibo, varie ed eventuali).</p>
<p>Dopo esserci interrogati a lungo su come reperire i capitali necessari a far partire il progetto, abbiamo deciso di lanciare una campagna di raccolta fondi.</p>
<p>Abbiamo quantificato in 9000€ il tetto minimo per affrontare tutte le spese inerenti all’acquisto del materiale tecnologico necessario, e per coprire i costi operativi di circa 3 mesi di lavoro (due mesi in Armenia ed Artsakh per raccogliere materiale, un mese a fare conferenze in giro per l’Italia).</p>
<p>Tuttavia la nostra ambizione è quella di raccogliere fondi sufficienti per restare in Armenia ed Artsakh per molto più di 3 mesi: per questo motivo vorremmo attivare una piattaforma Patreon e trovare degli sponsor che dal quarto mese ci aiutino a coprire almeno parzialmente i costi operativi. Al termine del conflitto, l’Operazione Hayk resterà attiva con la finalità di promuovere la cultura armena in Italia e di lanciare nuove iniziative di supporto al popolo dell’Artsakh.</p>
<p>Come verrebbero spesi i soldi qualora venisse raccolta una cifra superiore a 9000€?<br/>Questa circostanza garantirebbe fin da subito di poter operare sul territorio dell’Artsakh e portare avanti le attività informative/divulgative per un periodo di tempo maggiore dei 3 mesi preventivati. In base agli importi raccolti, inoltre, potrebbe concretizzarsi la possibilità di affrontare ulteriori investimenti in termini di attrezzature tecnologiche, nonché di fornire dei piccoli rimborsi-spese ai volontari.</p>
<p>Cosa accadrebbe se venisse raccolta una cifra inferiore?<br/>Qualora venissero raccolte donazioni pari o superiori a 4000€, vi sarebbe la possibilità di avviare l’Operazione Hayk in formato ridotto. Con una simile cifra, infatti, sarebbe possibile affrontare i costi di un parziale upgrade tecnico, ma non sarebbe possibile coprire le spese operative derivanti dalla presenza fissa di un inviato in Armenia ed Artsakh. In caso di raggiungimento di una cifra pari o superiore ai 4000€, dunque, vi sarebbero le risorse necessarie all’attivazione della piattaforma divulgativa. Verrebbero dunque attivati e gestiti i canali social, verrebbe postato molto materiale divulgativo/informativo e verrebbero pubblicati articoli sui giornali disposti a fornire spazio al progetto, ma non vi sarebbe modo di mandare il nostro inviato a raccogliere materiale in prima persona in Artsakh.</p>

<h3>Chi sono</h3>
<p>Sono Gianluca Alex Proietto, un giovane italiano dedito allo studio della storia e della cultura dei paesi che sorgono lungo la famosa Via della Seta.</p>
<p>Ho trascorso gli ultimi anni lontano dal suolo italico. Ho affrontato viaggi estremi in bicicletta attraverso le terre selvagge del Kazakistan, della Mongolia e della Siberia, ho vissuto a Tbilisi per 3 anni lavorando come guida storica, ho fatto volontariato in Mongolia e Corea del Sud, ed ho esplorato per anni l’intera Via della Seta con ogni mezzo di trasporto immaginabile.</p>
<p>Dal 2012 il focus del mio studio è sulla storia della Georgia, dell’Armenia, dell’Artsakh e dell’Iran. In particolare coltivo un profondo legame con la nazione armena, nella quale mi reco costantemente e sulla quale ho organizzato conferenze divulgative aventi per tema la storia dell’Armenia, il Medz Yeghern ed il conflitto del Nagorno Karabakh.</p>
<p>Nel 2020 ho iniziato a concepire un progetto chiamato Barbaristan che ha la finalità di divulgare tematiche storiche, culturali e geopolitiche su due aree geografiche ancora poco conosciute dal pubblico italiano: il Caucaso e l’Asia Centrale.</p>
<p>Il progetto Barbaristan si pone come obiettivo quello di promuovere la conoscenza di paesi e territori prossimi all’Europa tanto storicamente quanto culturalmente, ma poco noti alle nostre latitudini.</p>
<p>Allo stato attuale Barbaristan sta lanciando la sua prima campagna di divulgazione su larga scala: Operazione Hayk.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Do you personally have a concept of life on this planet without war? If you do, does it seem real?</p>
<p>Right. That's with this radio show and its education is all about. Creating life on this planet without war, and <i>knowing</i> it's real. <br/><br/><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6ff5NIhXyMwbXNycU5SWEJPVU0/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click Here to listen to a 4 minute audio sample.</a></p>
<p><i>Generation Of Harmony</i> integrates so many facets of life with harmony as the common factor. Life is meant to flourish! We do not have to live in conflict...there IS A DIFFERENT WAY! <br/><br/>If you are interested to read a snippet of my personal story, you can <a href=""http://www.kerrilake.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">find that here by clicking here</a>. My writing, my creations, my Tools...the more I look at what I've been creating for years and years, it's clear that it's all about HARMONY! Through the course of the radio show I'll be sharing from my personal journey of being a very spiritually gifted individual on a mission to create the absence of domination and war on our fantastic planet! <br/><br/>This is such an auspicious time to share the insights and the brilliance, to ask the questions that lead humanity to think differently, to relate differently to themselves and to life all around. I have those questions, and this is the platform for me to bring them forward. </p>
<p>As you help fund this opportunity, you are bringing a very clear voice of unconditional love and awareness to a syndicated, public audience. You are supporting my ability to share tools and awareness that bridge consciousness with business, culture, relationships and personal wellness. Life is not limited to the segregated aspects we identify with. We now have language and ability to bring it all together on a common foundation - Harmony. </p>
<p>On day 1 we are already being funded! </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get started with the first 6 months of our professionally produced show, we need to raise at least $2400. That covers production, marketing, branding, syndication and quite a bit of personal support for the host...me! This is just flat-necessary for me to bring my awareness and voice to you. Like I said, I've tried doing it myself and it's just not of service to anyone. For me to shine I need some support - hopefully this will also be inspiration for others to receive support for their gifts as well.</p>
<p>My gifts to share with you are all deeply seated in my consciousness and awareness, my capacity to integrate concepts and systems, and my well-recognized innate ability to bring harmony into conversations and relationships. I listen without judgment and ask questions that might just be the perfect flavor of uncomfortable so the truth can come to the surface. That's what really creates a healing space - the unconditional truth.<br/><br/>We will have guests once or twice per month whose heart and direction in the world are bridging and lighting the way to a paradigm of harmony. Our guests will be from all walks of life - no one profession or area of study can encompass the beauty of our hearts coming together to create a new world. We'll get to hear from corporate facilitators, equine-assisted facilitators and therapists, moms, teachers, community leaders, Uber drivers, friends, and who knows who else will show up with a heart and a message that opens the hearts of others. This is no exclusive dance, my friends. This is about bringing harmony to humanity. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Important Stuff</h3>
<p>This is a short campaign duration! <strong>The deadline is March 30th!</strong> So our perks are very much based in gratitude rather than physical gifts. </p>
<p>For gifts of $1000 or more, you will be invited on the air with me for a 10 minute conversation about your gifts, abilities, business and/or service. Let me help you share your light with those who want to know that you are here! <br/><br/>For gifts of $500 I will share a 15 second promotional announcement for your service, business or message. What an honor it will be to share so much goodness! </p>
<p>For gifts of $100 or less, I will share a public thank you on air for your contribution to this collaboratively created platform. <br/><br/>If you would like to be that donor who funds the whole amount, you will be invited as a guest for an entire show with me, and we'll dedicate part of the show to what your heart wants to share with the world.</p>
<p>When we reach our entire goal, the funds will go directly to professional production (and training the host) of the new syndicated show, Generation Of Harmony. Any funds received beyond the campaign goal will be used for marketing, promotion, communications and other expenses involved with running a show of the highest quality.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are in a new paradigm of consciousness. This show will fully include and extend beyond any niche of spirituality because hearts are opening in every realm of society. I would love to see this show become relevant in many different communities, professions, circles and walks of life. I would like to bring our common sense of harmony and kindness to one another forward as a common topic in every realm of life.</p>
<p>Your contribution lets me know that you see this as valuable, too. You become a collaborator in making heartful living a ""common thing"". You are helping provide the opportunity for a voice of unconditional listening, of kindness, of relationships without dominance into the world in a grand way.</p>
<p>I have been interviewed on several international and local shows over the past 4 years. Sometimes it was about my book, Listen Like A Horse: Relationships Without Dominance, other times we were speaking about sacred geometry, about communication and relationships, but each time, the conversation comes back to harmony. </p>
<p>I've had my writing published in international blogs, providing unique and integrated perspectives about climate change, about pregnancy and communication beyond the physical realms. My books have an international audience and are recognized as both pragmatic and metaphorical resources for living as a peaceful human being. My work has been seen as parallel to NonViolent Communication, and the feedback I receive is that this way of being is a profoundly gentle life-changer. That said, there is plenty of everyday human to express, too! That's kind of the gold, isn't it? That we are bringing these divine levels of awareness right down into our human expression...which is sometimes a little rough around the edges!</p>
<p>This is what I want to share with the world! With laughter, with lightness of being, and with laser-clear courage to see the old ways of being for the obsolete anachronisms they are, call them out and provide strategies and perspectives for a new way of being human. </p>
<p>It's not that I have all the answers. I'm not claiming to know anything more than the truth as it presents to me. But I do LOVE the conversation, I love asking the questions, and I love being the space that empowers others to step into their own heart and lead simply by their own presence. Sharing from my own journey goes a long way - I've been from the lowest of self-esteem to the brightest light of divine knowing. There's a lot of insight there to share.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Here's the thing. I've never done this before. I'm asking for your help with funding because I know I need the help and support from people who know what they're doing! My friends who have radio shows have given me a sense of what it takes to have a topic each week, to book guests, to be ""on"" when you need to be on. The funding is to provide the foundation that gives me the very best chance at success that I can have. </p>
<p>I would pay for this myself if I could! Again, here is where I ask for help. I don't have the funds myself to dive straight in, otherwise I would. This opportunity has come to me through friends suggesting I be on someone else's show, then that opens a door to another contact, then that contact opens the door to another opportunity. And when the timing comes together in uncanny ways, you just can't say no. So I'm going for it! </p>
<p>I will love sharing the journey with everyone on the air. One of my gifts is my ability to share what's really going on in a very real way. To be honest, sharing with that level of openness is cathartic for me. Sharing bigly, sharing vulnerably brings me feedback, every single time, that this is one of my gifts, one of the gifts that when I share, others really receive it. Whatever it ends up being, you can be sure that I'm here to share the truth in a way that will hopefully help others know that it's okay for them to live full-out as well. It will be a journey of perpetual awakening and expansion for myself right along with all of our listeners.</p>
<p>This is my call for support financially and in production. I'm game for the ride. Are you coming with me?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute dollars but you'd like to show your support for <i>Generation Of Harmony</i>, you can help by suggesting topics, sharing the questions you'd like to see me address, sharing the evolution that you see in humanity, or sharing this show with others who may be interested!</p>
<p>Indigogo provides sharing tools - when you use them, everyone wins! And truly, where we are all headed, the way one of us wins is when everyone wins. Let's really live that way and see what life looks like from that stage!</p>

That's what really creates a healing space - the unconditional truth.We will have guests once or twice per month whose heart and direction in the world are bridging and lighting the way to a paradigm of harmony. Our guests will be from all walks of life - no one profession or area of study can encompass the beauty of our hearts coming together to create a new world. We'll get to hear from corporate facilitators, equine-assisted facilitators and therapists, moms, teachers, community leaders, Uber drivers, friends, and who knows who else will show up with a heart and a message that opens the hearts of others. This is no exclusive dance, my friends. This is about bringing harmony to humanity. 
 
The Important Stuff
This is a short campaign duration! The deadline is March 30th! So our perks are very much based in gratitude rather than physical gifts. 
For gifts of $1000 or more, you will be invited on the air with me for a 10 minute conversation about your gifts, abilities, business and/or service. Let me help you share your light with those who want to know that you are here! For gifts of $500 I will share a 15 second promotional announcement for your service, business or message. What an honor it will be to share so much goodness! 
For gifts of $100 or less, I will share a public thank you on air for your contribution to this collaboratively created platform. If you would like to be that donor who funds the whole amount, you will be invited as a guest for an entire show with me, and we'll dedicate part of the show to what your heart wants to share with the world.
When we reach our entire goal, the funds will go directly to professional production (and training the host) of the new syndicated show, Generation Of Harmony. Any funds received beyond the campaign goal will be used for marketing, promotion, communications and other expenses involved with running a show of the highest quality.
 

The Impact
We are in a new paradigm of consciousness. This show will fully include and extend beyond any niche of spirituality because hearts are opening in every realm of society. I would love to see this show become relevant in many different communities, professions, circles and walks of life. I would like to bring our common sense of harmony and kindness to one another forward as a common topic in every realm of life.
Your contribution lets me know that you see this as valuable, too. You become a collaborator in making heartful living a ""common thing"". You are helping provide the opportunity for a voice of unconditional listening, of kindness, of relationships without dominance into the world in a grand way.
I have been interviewed on several international and local shows over the past 4 years. Sometimes it was about my book, Listen Like A Horse: Relationships Without Dominance, other times we were speaking about sacred geometry, about communication and relationships, but each time, the conversation comes back to harmony. 
I've had my writing published in international blogs, providing unique and integrated perspectives about climate change, about pregnancy and communication beyond the physical realms. My books have an international audience and are recognized as both pragmatic and metaphorical resources for living as a peaceful human being. My work has been seen as parallel to NonViolent Communication, and the feedback I receive is that this way of being is a profoundly gentle life-changer. That said, there is plenty of everyday human to express, too! That's kind of the gold, isn't it? That we are bringing these divine levels of awareness right down into our human expression...which is sometimes a little rough around the edges!
This is what I want to share with the world! With laughter, with lightness of being, and with laser-clear courage to see the old ways of being for the obsolete anachronisms they are, call them out and provide strategies and perspectives for a new way of being human. 
It's not that I have all the answers. I'm not claiming to know anything more than the truth as it presents to me. But I do LOVE the conversation, I love asking the questions, and I love being the space that empowers others to step into their own heart and lead simply by their own presence. Sharing from my own journey goes a long way - I've been from the lowest of self-esteem to the brightest light of divine knowing. There's a lot of insight there to share.
 

Risks & Challenges
Here's the thing. I've never done this before. I'm asking for your help with funding because I know I need the help and support from people who know what they're doing! My friends who have radio shows have given me a sense of what it takes to have a topic each week, to book guests, to be ""on"" when you need to be on. The funding is to provide the foundation that gives me the very best chance at success that I can have. 
I would pay for this myself if I could! Again, here is where I ask for help. I don't have the funds myself to dive straight in, otherwise I would. This opportunity has come to me through friends suggesting I be on someone else's show, then that opens a door to another contact, then that contact opens the door to another opportunity. And when the timing comes together in uncanny ways, you just can't say no. So I'm going for it! 
I will love sharing the journey with everyone on the air. One of my gifts is my ability to share what's really going on in a very real way. To be honest, sharing with that level of openness is cathartic for me. Sharing bigly, sharing vulnerably brings me feedback, every single time, that this is one of my gifts, one of the gifts that when I share, others really receive it. Whatever it ends up being, you can be sure that I'm here to share the truth in a way that will hopefully help others know that it's okay for them to live full-out as well. It will be a journey of perpetual awakening and expansion for myself right along with all of our listeners.
This is my call for support financially and in production. I'm game for the ride. Are you coming with me?

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute dollars but you'd like to show your support for Generation Of Harmony, you can help by suggesting topics, sharing the questions you'd like to see me address, sharing the evolution that you see in humanity, or sharing this show with others who may be interested!

<h3>Who's Killarney Star?</h3>
<p>I'm a piano singer-songwriter who's been writing songs since I was three. Last year my family and I sold everything we owned, <strong>became minimalists, and hit the road as nomads.</strong> I support us with <strong>house concerts and selling merch as well as custom songs and videos.</strong> I write, play the piano, and sing as performing artist Killarney Star. </p>
<p>And the best way for me to showcase and sell my custom songwriting skills is through a <strong>very unique new podcast I'm launching in January 2020, called <i>The Three Story Song</i> </strong> - kind of like <i>Song Explode</i>r meets <i>This American Life</i>. I interview everyday people like you and me, find a common thread, and explain how I weave one or more of their stories into a song, all right there in the same episode.</p>
<p>If you're interested in <strong>songwriting, honing your writing chops, how music is made, or just hearing some really good stories shaped into art on the spot, you'll love this podcast.</strong> I've been a professional writer for over ten years, hired as a pro blogger, an ad copy specialist, a feature editor, and a custom songwriter. I'll inspire you to whittle away everything in your writing - and your life - that isn't your purest art form, and to make your creations shine with your true aura.</p>
<p>You can check out my songs on Spotify, Apple or any streaming service, and my song videos on Instagram @killarney_star and Facebook @killarneystar.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Is Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Launching a podcast isn't rocket science, but for a newbie like me, <strong>it does take funding and training</strong>. I've been handpicked for my potential and have been personally invited to attend an exclusive four-day podcasting conference, the <a href=""https://newmediasummit.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New Media Summit</a>, in San Diego in September.</p>
<p><strong>This conference is of enormous importance to launching this podcast because it will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allow me to network with some major podcasters to get on their shows and expose my story, my podcast, and my custom songs to large audiences.</li>
<li>Train me to pitch successfully to podcasters, as well as to host and promote my own podcast.</li>
<li>By doing those things, contribute significantly to my holiday sales of custom songs so I can close out the year strong and support my family, doing what I love to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>My conference ticket is comped, but for airfare and hotel, <strong>I need exactly $900. An additional $200 would give me a stipend for meals at $50/ day for 3 meals.</strong> (Hey - it's California, and due to an autoimmune issue I eat gluten free.)</p>
<p><strong>And $300 on top of that would get me set up with a podcast editing service</strong> like Podcast Polish to help my first episodes sound great and attract more listeners!</p>
<p><strong>And an additional $400 would 100% go towards promoting the podcast</strong> on Facebook and Instagram ads, to gain new subscribers as fast as possible!</p>
<p><strong>So you are very generously helping me raise $1800 in total to train, network, and launch this podcast that will change lives. My heart is full!!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>HERE'S WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU:</h3>
<p><strong>Everyone who contributes will get one line in a song I’ll write and play on all my social media channels: </strong>Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, email, and Spotify/ all streaming platforms (when it’s recorded and released). It will be about a universal theme, and each contributor will be asked a question whose answer I'll use to craft your particular line in the song. If possible I will use your words verbatim!</p>
<p><strong>You can also receive: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A personalized, autographed CD</li>
<li>A high-quality Bella Canvas t-shirt with the lyrics to one of my songs</li>
<li>A 30 minute one-on-one songwriting session OR 30 minute Skype with me just to chat</li>
<li>A package of all of the above </li>
<li>You very own entire custom song (normally $1000) - this very special award price of $500 will never be offered again, and is only available to the first taker at this level. Most custom song writers charge upwards of $1500 to $3000 for a custom song.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>IF I DON'T REACH MY GOAL</h3>
<p>I can still use the funds you've helped me raise to attend the professional podcasting conference, and that will put me on my way towards launching the podcast in early 2020.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>I'm guessing that, like more than 62 million others, you listen to podcasts often, maybe on your commute, while exercising, at work, or while caring for family. Podcasts let light into our souls where we didn't know we had cracks.<strong> </strong>That feeling when you discover someone's story is so relatable to yours... is like discovering a new song on Spotify or Apple that touches you in a new way.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine being able to hear the stories and experience the songs being built right before your ears.</strong> You've discovered an amazing new song that no one knows about yet. But you've also discovered something about yourself - a tenacity, a faltering, a little laugh, an epiphany - that you hadn't realized until you heard that story. And best of all, you've discovered that we all have so many common threads, we're never alone.</p>
<p>Stories change lives. Stories save the world.</p>
<p>You can change everything by helping me create and share these stories and songs.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether you can contribute or not, there are a few ways you can help. I have such a wonderful social media community of sharers and shouters I am SO grateful for every day! </p>
<p>Please don't keep this campaign to yourself! Feel free to share it far and wide - it can lead to hundreds of dollars of funds. Someone can get an awesome full-length album CD that can't be found anywhere else until after this campaign; an aspiring songwriter can get my professional help to polish up their song; a few people can get my sunny company and ask me anything about my music or my life for a little while; or some lucky person can get their own song - maybe for themselves or the BEST gift for a loved one!</p>
<p>Simply use the Indiegogo share tools found on this page - it only takes a moment. And if one more person finds out about this podcast because of you, you've shared something priceless - the chance to have a story heard and immortalized into a song we can all relate to.</p>
<p>With my deepest thanks for your good energy, your belief in me, and your contributions,</p>

<h3>Qué es el <i>No sé, dime tour BUENOS AIRES</i>
</h3>
<p>Agarrar nuestras maletas para ir a <b>Buenos Aires</b>, encontrar un teatro para grabar en vivo nuestro podcast contigo muerto de risa en el público, invitar a un ""salmón"" famoso de <strong>Argentina</strong> para que se siente con nosotros (si no has escuchado el podcast, no sabes qué es un ""salmón""... ¡cambia eso de ti!) y nos deje entrevistarlo para que nos cuente por qué también siente que no pertenece, documentar todo nuestro viaje con un equipo de profesionales audiovisuales de cada ciudad y convertir nuestro pequeño podcast casero en un programa de TV de verdad en el que los protagonistas son los <i>#superdiamantes</i> que nos escuchan en todo el mundo.</p>
<h3><b>Cómo queremos hacerlo</b></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Hacer un programa como este es súper ambicioso. No solo tienes que invertir en la producción del evento, en los pasajes, en el alojamiento, sino también en trabajar con un equipo de profesionales con la experiencia suficiente para garantizar que el resultado final no tenga nada que envidiarle a programas que puedes ver en lugares como <strong>Netflix</strong> o <strong>HBO</strong>.</p>

<p>Además de entradas para que nos acompañes a dejar el corazón en un teatro de la hermosa ciudad de <strong>Buenos Aires</strong> en un show que tú mismo crearás con nosotros, tenemos <i>perks </i>para superdiamantes que quieran y puedan contribuir con un poquito más para obtener desde cosas súper especiales como franelas que sólo van a estás disponibles si hacemos el tour, estar en los créditos de la serie como productores, o hasta ser invitados especiales en un podcast con nosotros (¡la pizza corre por nuestra cuenta!).</p>

<p>Queremos arrancar la gira oficialmente <strong>después del 15 de Septiembre</strong>, por lo que necesitamos producir todo durante el verano.

<p>La idea es comenzar con una ciudad y si logramos la meta, hacer otra y otra y otra hasta que podamos llegar a la mayor cantidad de ciudades posibles.</p>
<p>Como ves, estamos apostándolo todo a esto.</p>
<p>Esto es lo que queremos: si logramos hacer al menos 5 ciudades podemos seguir haciendo el podcast.</p>

</div></div>","Quienes somos

Hola, somos Maiah y Gabriel, los dos loquitos que desde hace un año hacen No sé, dime tú, un podcast en español para todos aquellos que alguna vez han sentido que no pertenecen.
Todas las semanas nos escuchas desde Colombia, España, Chile, Argentina, Perú, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Panamá, Canadá, México, Inglaterra, China, Italia, Francia, Estados Unidos y hasta en Bakú, Azerbaijan.
Si no nos conoces 
Lo puedes escuchar completico aquí.
O suscribirte en iTunes.
O seguirlo en Spotify.
O verlo cada semana en wedontbelong,com.
Tenemos un año y más de 50 episodios haciéndolo.
Ahora estamos aquí para que nos ayudes a conocerte en persona.
Para eso inventamos el No sé, dime tour.
Y queremos que una de sus paradas sea la bella ciudad de Buenos Aires, en Argentina.
Qué es el No sé, dime tour BUENOS AIRES

Agarrar nuestras maletas para ir a Buenos Aires, encontrar un teatro para grabar en vivo nuestro podcast contigo muerto de risa en el público, invitar a un ""salmón"" famoso de Argentina para que se siente con nosotros (si no has escuchado el podcast, no sabes qué es un ""salmón""... ¡cambia eso de ti!) y nos deje entrevistarlo para que nos cuente por qué también siente que no pertenece, documentar todo nuestro viaje con un equipo de profesionales audiovisuales de cada ciudad y convertir nuestro pequeño podcast casero en un programa de TV de verdad en el que los protagonistas son los #superdiamantes que nos escuchan en todo el mundo.
Cómo queremos hacerlo

Hacer un programa como este es súper ambicioso. No solo tienes que invertir en la producción del evento, en los pasajes, en el alojamiento, sino también en trabajar con un equipo de profesionales con la experiencia suficiente para garantizar que el resultado final no tenga nada que envidiarle a programas que puedes ver en lugares como Netflix o HBO.
A lo mejor no lo sabes, pero un sólo episodio de un programa así puede llegar a costar cientos de miles de dólares en el mundo real.
Por qué nosotros
Si nos conoces sabes que desde hace años hemos desarrollado proyectos para Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Snap Inc, Batanga Media, AOL, Microsoft, HLN, Univision, Discovery, NBC Universo, Mitú, Fullscreen, Clevver TV, Broadway Video y marcas como McDonalds, Bud Light, AT&T, Volvo, Ford, Covergirl, Makeup Forever, Best Buy, Target, Google, Johnny Walker, entre muchas otras.
Parte de las cosas que hemos hecho las puedes encontrar aquí. 
Juntos hemos estado nominados a los Streamy Awards 3 veces (más veces que cualquier creador Latino)

 
a los Shorty Awards...
Y hasta teníamos nuestra sección en un noticiero todas las semanas.
Luego creamos este podcast y han hablado de él en E! Entertainment Television, en Radio Caracol, en CNN y hasta nos metieron en la lista de los podcast que definitivament deberías escuchar de la revista Latina.
Pero nada de eso importa tanto como que tú lo veas y escuches cada semana.
Por eso esto queremos llevarlo a otro nivel y hacerlo teniendo control del proyecto y dejando que seas tú mismo quién está detrás de esto.
Queremos algo de superdiamantes para superdiamantes.
Y aunque nosotros somos buenos consiguiendo ayuda y haciendo que cosas de ultra bajo presupuesto se vean bien, aún así necesitamos un monto mínimo para poder llevar el No sé, dime tour a cada país.
No hacemos esto para hacernos millonarios, pero sí creemos que con tu ayuda podríamos hacer algo que nos gusta a nosotros y a ti por muchísimos años más.
El problema
Montar esta producción tiene costos operativos importantes.
Desde conseguir el teatro hasta conseguir alojamiento, los pasajes, grabar, editar todo para que esté al nivel de un programa de televisión...
Así que si vamos a hacerlo, vamos a hacerlo bien y repetir esto en todos los países que podamos.

Usar el resto para seguir haciendo el podcast y todo nuestro contenido cada semana.

Cómo lo utilizaremos

Alquiler del Teatro (entre 30% y 50% de lo recaudado)
Merch
Logística (Alojamiento, pasajes, transporte, comidas)
Alquiler de equipos
Honorarios de producción
Mercadeo de la gira

<h3>WE NEVER STOP GROWING!</h3>
<p>I had great plans and a timeframe for success when I was younger; what i'd do at 30 and then 40 and then 50 etc. When I got to 30 I realized life had its own tide and some things I couldn't control. But what I could control was who I was to become inside. It was a time of reflection and growth, needed at that stage in my journey. I met many women from different walks of life on the same journey, and it led to great mentor/mentee relationships as we grew together. Fast forward and I founded ALVN to merge my skill in movie making  with a desire to help women grow, believing that in relationships and gentle reflections -  as we are exposed to insightful information - do we change.</p>
<p>On ALVN we have <u>short films</u>, <u>documentaries</u>, <u>personal stories</u> and a <u>conversation forum</u> to bring women together,  so they feel intrinsically valuable and empowered to live their lives to their definition of success. Our newest feature to be added will complete the circle, and this campaign helps with that.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>OUR ASK</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our technical team needs $8,000 to build a video upload feature on the website that enables our users upload their video stories straight from a smart phone. In addition, this quote will allow us to fix mobile optimization problems and minor upgrades needed on the website. Any amount raised above $8,000 will be used for marketing and PR. </p>

<p>We are two sisters who are passionate about three things: stories, podcasts, and cake (but that last one isn’t super relevant). That’s why we are creating Hometown, an anthology audiodrama in which residents of a fictional town share their individual stories with Kiera, a lifelong resident of the town who seeks to find a sense of community.</p>
<p>Our goal in season one of Hometown is to build a strong foundation for the show, so that going forward it can become a space where other artists can contribute their work. We hope to allow other writers an easily accessible platform to share their work, and build a strong sense of community around the show, just as Kiera searches for in the story.</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you can become a part of this community, and help us create Hometown-- a podcast about finding community, what it means to have a home, and the stories that make us who we are.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>It is important to us to create a high quality show, and to pay the other artists who contribute to the project. We are doing everything we can to keep the start up cost low, and 100% of the money we receive will be directly applied to the show. We do not plan on making a profit on this show at this point in time. Your contributions allow us to raise the quality of the show! A few specific expenses for season one include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay our graphic designer for the lovely logo she designed for us</li>
<li>Pay our composer for the awesome music that he wrote for us</li>
<li>Fund the equipment we need to make our show sound great</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What You Can Get</h3>
<p>Depending on the amount you contribute, you can receive amazing rewards such as access to our donor only Discord server, early access to episodes, director’s notes, personalized thank you cards, and even a character named after you or a loved one in the show!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we do not meet our goal, we will still move forward with the project, but we will have to pay out of pocket for expenses. Both of us are fairly broke students, so this is less than ideal. Contributions also allow us the opportunity to create a show of a higher quality.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey everyone, my name is Kwame Jackson and I am a recent graduate of Xavier University of Louisiana where I studied Biology and Neuroscience. I had the opportunity to study Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of California, Los Angeles and Brown University in my brief scientific career and from that emerged the idea that I now call FULL | DISCLOSURE: BE THE CHANGE.</p>
<p>This year I set off on a journey to 25+ conferences related to science and social justice! I am building a dynamic collective of scientists, activists, thought leaders and community advocates who will help to organize a simple platform that will empower people with applicable knowledge to be the change they wish to see in the world!</p>
<p>So far I have been to 6 conferences and hosted an event in Houston, TX where we had more than 95 in attendance! With so much success so already, someone has recommended that I document this journey on as many social media platforms as possible so that others can experience this journey along with me! In order to do that I will need to hire a partner to travel with me to all of the conferences and invest in some camera and audio equipment for video content!</p>
<p>One of my mentors says that there are three things that you need to do in life: STUDY PRACTICE and TEACH. 2017 is all about studying!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>$7500 will go to conference registration costs!</li>
<li>$1000 to camera equipment!</li>
<li>$2500 to compensate camera crews across the nation!</li>
<li>$2000 miscellaneous and emergencies</li>
</ul>
<p>First 50 contributors will receive a personal visit from me along the journey for a short Q &amp; A!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will provide the financial flexibility to ensure an incredible volume of content thru audio, video and written word. This will make it easy for me to share real-time, day to day experiences and perspectives with you and others in the audience. This is so important because without sufficient content, other people will not be able to truly capture the experince of this journey!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks that we foresee are related to unexpected changes in conference information that would lead us to have to rearrange travel plans etc. While this is not a major problem, it could disrupt the flow of the journey and or interfere with currently scheduled events!</p>
<p><b>Other ways you can help!</b></p>
<p>If you have any quality camera equipment and would like to donate it as your contribution that would work as well! Just message me directly!</p>

<p><strong>You're asking:</strong> In a crowded media environment, who needs another website? We're aiming for a new model for accessible, candid, expert journalism. Please give us five minutes of your valuable time to make the case.</p>
<p><strong>Hearsay Culture to Relaunch as the Hearsay Culture Network</strong></p>
<p>Building on a successful  15 year KZSU-FM (Stanford University) broadcast history covering technology and society, the newly-formed Hearsay Culture Media, LLC (HC Media) is launching a breakthrough, sustainable media publishing platform.</p>
<p><strong>HC Media’s mission to increase expert information access, combat misinformation, and enable rational public discourse with transparent integrity. </strong>The purpose is to provide the public with accurate understanding that drives our future, rather than being stalled by lack of information. We elevate perspectives and voices that are often lost in media noise.</p>
<p><strong>HC Media's Hearsay Culture Network (HC Network) will translate complex innovations in business, culture, and technology into easy takeaways for diverse audiences.</strong> We engage our listeners with candor and insight, both from the interviewers and the interviewees, to get into the minds of those whose thoughts and actions drive our world. We ask the hard questions from a position of transparency and expertise. We go into the ""lion's den"" to take on controversial issues and policy challenges, conveying clear takeaways and unique insights.</p>
<p>As you confront the challenges in our post-pandemic times, we can help you understand them better and tackle them more successfully. But to help, we need to build the HC Network, and we humbly ask for and need your support.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p><strong>Since May 2006, Hearsay Culture (HC) has established itself as a leading outlet for high-quality content covering a range of technology issues, from the internet to robotics to artificial intelligence. </strong>Airing on Stanford University’s radio station, KZSU-FM, it is heard internationally via podcast and public programming.</p>
<p>HC has received praise over its 15 year history, from University of Southern California Wallis Annenberg Chair in Communication Technology and Society Manuel Castells (“[An] excellent show . . . in which people can be offered a way to reflect rather than to react”) to being named part of the Blawg 100 of 2008 by the American Bar Association (a top 100 website). Guests and listeners have remarked that it’s a favorite show; communications scholars have called it “agenda setting.” In 2016, HC celebrated its ten year anniversary with a live interview featuring Harvard Law Professor Larry Lessig. </p>
<p>Over 260 interviews on, we are the podcasting world’s most enduring long-form technology interview show. </p>
<p><strong>Now it’s time for a new phase that addresses our world’s most urgent challenges. </strong>There are no established media outlets in the United States with a singular focus to transform complex societal and technological developments into clear take-aways for a diverse audience. HC Media’s goals are to provide expert curation of complex current topics (like discrimination via artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and the emergence of holographic technology) and serve this information in unbiased take-aways in dynamic formats through a new media publishing platform.</p>
<p><strong>With candor and engagement, we will unearth unique insights that help you chart your path and your future.</strong></p>
<p>Using our signature, transparent “we ask the best questions” approach, HC Media will take on the world’s most dynamic trends. Through the HC Network, expert-to-expert interviews (including new exciting interviewers), moderated debates, long-form discussions, video webinars, and curated content will translate complex information into common knowledge, accessible and understandable by all.</p>
<p><strong>Importantly, HC Media’s goals are expansive, but its ethics and integrity remain the same. </strong> HC Media will not serve you with endless advertising, or sell your personal data to third parties. We are not mercenaries. Rather, we will continue to offer free programming, like the signature one-hour weekly radio show, as well as additional programming and opportunities for education and networking by paid subscription. </p>

From 2014-2017, he was a Visiting Research Collaborator at Princeton University’s Center for Information Technology Policy. He is also the founder and host of HC, and the co-author of <i>INFORMATION LAW, GOVERNANCE, AND CYBERSECURITY</i> (West Academic Publishing 2019), was a regular contributor to <i>Slate</i>, has addressed and advised policymakers across the political spectrum on a range of intellectual property and technology policy issues, and has been published and quoted in leading newspapers, websites, and academic journals in the US and EU.</p>

His multimedia background (MA, Stanford) and US and European leadership roles in corporations and start-ups alike has placed him consistently at the forefront of innovation. Howard has written over 100 news articles and books on new technology that have been published around the world. </p>
<p><strong>Why We Need Your Help </strong></p>
<p><strong>HC has intentionally refrained from all revenue generation. </strong>We have rejected advertising and profits in pursuit of educating our listeners about cutting edge developments that shape our world. This was financially sustainable, as long as HC remained a one-show-per-week program on KZSU-FM with a limited website and platform.</p>
<p>Our expanded HC Network media platform is ambitious, especially in a crowded, polarized environment where media companies struggle for survival. We think our updated programming will make a difference, but we need your financial help to do it. </p>
<p><strong>We have already recorded interviews with exciting guests</strong>, like renowned jazz trumpeter Jeremy Pelt (author of <i>Griot: Examining the Lives of Jazz’s Great Storytellers</i>) and Georgetown’s Lorelei Kelly (one of the nation’s experts on how technology can improve the operations of the US Senate). More terrific guests and new hosts will be joining us in the coming weeks and months! With a more robust website, webinars and networking events will follow.</p>
<p><strong>To sum it up, we want to drive a renewed media culture head-on by creating a sustainable new publishing platform that can be replicated by other outlets and podcasters, with the transparency and integrity that does not sell a commercial message, or your privacy, to the highest bidder. </strong>Will you help us get there? Note that by doing so, you are not just helping us, but also potentially helping other journalists and podcasters who may want to provide great content, but haven’t figured out how to make it work in our brutal media environment. You support will help us lead the way!</p>
<p><strong>Where Your Money Will Go</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your donations will finance HC Media’s global release of HC Network's new website and expanded programming. </strong>To build a sustainable new media platform that forges extraordinary content, while maintaining integrity, independence, and consumer privacy, we must buy equipment, build a robust media website, and retain applications for serving content. </p>

</div></div>","Future Primitive Podcast and Community Relaunch
Dear friends of Future Primitive — it is with great joy that we share with you our plans for a new website and online community.  As divisiveness engulfs many sectors of our interconnected lives, we yearn to deepen intimacy with each other.  Over the last 10 years, this weekly podcast has been a treasure for hundreds of thousands of people, nourishing their souls with heartfelt exchanges between wisdom teachers, experienced elders, and pioneers of consciousness.  It has also been extremely rewarding for myself, as I have shared countless tender moments with our guests.
It is in this spirit that we invite you to participate on a new level as a paying member, so that our exploration into the knowledge of our ancestors can continue to pour into our visions for a hope-filled future.  
- Joanna Harcourt-Smith

The Purpose of this Campaign
The funds raised during this campaign will be used to redesign our website (http://futureprimitive.org) and craft the community offerings that will be housed within the new website.  Tasks include cataloging our archives and updating photo and bio content, new art and branding, server and hosting upgrades, community forum and services design, and last member integration and communications.  The funds will also cover the costs incurred preparing this campaign.

The purpose of the campaign is to jumpstart our paid subscription base and to create an exciting new community platform for us to broaden our listenership.
We are committed to making this happen, so come join us!

Our New Website & Community Plans
We have envisioned a new website and a community subscription model that will both sustain Future Primitive and create a whole new way for our listeners and our guests to interact with each other.  This will include a secure online forum and communications system, where our listeners, guests and hosts can share their thoughts and creativity with one another.  
For the first five years of our podcast, we were financially sustained by the Marion Institute.  After Marion shifted their assets to environmental and other educational initiatives, Future Primitive has continued through the generosity of our listeners and friends.
Golden Stupa Media (https://goldenstupa.media) will be overseeing branding and artistic upgrades, as well building the website and community forum.
Benefits of becoming a paying member of Future Primitive:


Archive Access:  Logged in members will be able to play each episode in the FP archive.  Once launched, the most recent three episodes will remain available on our public podcast feed.

Forum:  Logged in members will have access to a secure community forum, where previous and current guests, other subscribers and the hosts can discuss episode subject matters, current events, philosophize, and share their creative offerings and projects.

Special Content and Videos:  Audiobooks (e.g. Tripping the Bardo), nuggets from previous episodes (transcripts, juicy excerpts), videos, ebooks, art and music downloads, and more!

Q&A with Guests:  We will coordinate with current and previous guests to hold scheduled and publicized Q&A sessions on the community forum.  Some of these will be live streaming video events.

We have begun building the foundation for our new website and subscription system, but with your help we plan to launch in September 2017!
Rewards
All of our rewards include a community membership, with options ranging from 3 months to two years.  In addition, we offer the following perks on some rewards:

The audiobook of Joanna's book ""Tripping the Bardo with Timothy Leary"", to be released in fall of 2017.

<h3>Hi, I'm Zac - aka Little Cook Big City!</h3>
<p>One of my favourite things to do is cook and explore different foods. I'm 9 years old, and in year 4.</p>
<p>My love for cooking began when I was just 2 years old, when I would sit on the kitchen bench and  help my mum mix scrambled eggs each morning. </p>
<p>Since then, I get into the kitchen or cook up a BBQ as often as I can. I love being able to create new dishes. It makes me feel free and helps me express myself.</p>
<p>One of my goals is to meet my food idols <strong>Jamie Oliver, Heston Blumenthal</strong> and <strong>Marco Pierre White.</strong></p>
<p>I also <strong>REALLY</strong> want to be on MasterChef, and am always learning new things.</p>
<p>Sharing my food adventures with family and friends on Instagram and YouTube is super fun, and I'm really keen to become a <strong>YouTuber.</strong></p>

This is the third, and final, installment in the great, ""<i>Smothered</i>,"" Crowdfunding Trilogy. The reason that I've decided to start another campaign is simple: the story deserves it, the production team &amp; cast deserve it, CASA deserves it, and the message deserves it. So here we are once more, in one more push to maximize our impact with this.</p><p>My name is R. Lawson Cade, and thank you for taking the time to stop by and check out what this campaign is all about. This is an opportunity for folks to become an integral part in R-Cade Productions' first, official in-house production. ""Smothered."" An audio drama that is planned to be delivered in the format of an estimated 7-8 episode podcast series. The story will tell a highly intensive, nail-biting criminal investigation that will put the character's moralities in question. Join us in experiencing the tremendous joys that comes with the creation of something, while sharing the story's crucial lessons with the world. Becoming a vital asset to the creation of something, at a price completely self-determined? Trust me. The payoff will be priceless.   </p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>It may not seem it, but even a podcast series has its fair share of expenses that go with it...</p><p>We've managed to budget both a minimum, and maximum, estimated total cost for this. The minimum goal will certainly be enough to allow our team to get by, while the maximum goal will allow us the opportunity to invest in more robust gear, create some reserve funds should the unexpected happen, and provide us with a larger donation to CASA. These figures represent ever aspect of this piece's production from:</p><p>Actor Performances</p><ul>
<li>Composers</li>
<li>Sound Designers</li>
<li>Story Consultants</li>
<li>Editors</li>
<li>Gear</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Materials</li>
<li>Scheduling &amp; Coordination</li>
<li>DirectorsDonations</li>
</ul><h3>To A Charitable Cause</h3><p>We have all intentions of making this product it's finest form possible. What we're asking of you, our potential backers, is the financial stability necessary to properly compensate our team for their time and efforts. Beyond that, we pledge to donate the remainder of the production's funds to the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) for Children. The fact that humanity has been gifted with the ability to express ourselves artistically is a remarkable thing. However we, at R-Cade Productions, wish to take that luxury and use it as a platform to inspire change and betterment in our world. </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Curious to know who you'll be directly affecting/ supporting by donating?</p><ul>
<li>Providing artist with an opportunity to showcase their craft, while financially supporting them for their time and efforts.</li>
<li>Being apart of a story with depth and poignancy.</li>
<li>Supporting a National Association that provides support systems and second chances to escape from their neglectful, or abusive, households. </li>
<li>A message worth sharing.   </li>
</ul><h3>What <i>You</i> Get</h3><p>R-Cade Productions is a modest sized production company. Aside from the satisfactions that comes with a donation to a great cause, I'm afraid we cannot offer too much to those interested in backing this campaign. What we can offer to you, should you feel inspired to donate, can be found listed below. We do sincerely apologize that there isn't more incentive for you folks to consider backing this cause. In the future, we pledge to remedy that.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Aural &amp; Listed Credit</strong> - When you donate to this campaign, you become apart of it. Providing the stability necessary to sustain this product is crucial to it's creation, after all. We promise to credit each backer in the piece's credits. Beyond that, we want to encourage you folks to make an audio recording stating your name. Once you've made the recording, feel free to send the file to us at rcadeproductions@gmail.com and that recording will be featured at some point in one of the piece's installments.</li>
<li>
<strong>Private Listening Party Invitation</strong> - Once the production has reached it's conclusion, backers will be contacted about an opportunity to experience the finished product before it goes live on all major streaming services. As of right now, the location, date, &amp; time for the party are TBD, but we will share the official information with everyone with plenty of time to plan accordingly. We recognize that this perk cannot be extended to those contributors outside of the DMV area, unless they are willing to travel a greater distance, and do sincerely apologize for that.</li>
<li>
<strong>Our Sincerest Gratitude</strong> - We pledge to personally thank each and every one of our backers, once the production has wrapped and published. </li>
</ul><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>If anyone has ever been involved in production, or any form of collaboration, then you will know that the larger the involvement the greater the margin or error can become. This is why having folks who are experienced in communicating, scheduling, and coming up with contingency plans are of utmost importance. Dealing with intellectual properties, especially on a collaborative level, certainly comes with its challenges. For instances: meeting deadlines over striving for, ""perfection,"" unexpected schedule changes with an actor, equipment troubleshooting, etc. I admit that the chances of these occurring during our production period are always present. This is why we intend to work with those who have tight track records. Many of the positions listed above have already been filled, as they've proven to get the job done on multiple occasions. With our infrastructure as optimized as possible, we promise that these risk will be significantly reduced.  </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We completely understand that times can be financially difficult. We've all been in those situations where we want to contribute to a good cause, but the prospect of doing so isn't the most ideal. Not to worry! there are other ways to assist in our campaign. </p><p>You can:</p><ul>
<li>Share the campaign page on social media, with friends, family members, etc. The more folks are aware of this, the greater our chances of succeeding become!</li>
<li>Share with media companies.</li>
<li>If you are more interested in assisting the in the creation of the piece itself, feel free to reach out to us at our email: rcadeproductions@gmail.com . Be sure to include positions you're interested in filling, along with any credentials you hold in your particular position of interested (portfolio, website, IMDb page, certifications, etc.) </li>
