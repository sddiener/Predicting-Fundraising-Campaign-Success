était de concevoir le smartphone le plus sécurisé sur les réseaux mobiles. Partant d'un concept sur lequel on a travaillé depuis plus de deux années et pour lequel on a déposé une requête de brevet, nous avons imaginé l'architecture de ce smartphone, et suite 
à  l'avancée de nos recherches, il nous a paru plus que nécessaire qu'il soit d'architecture Intel® x86 (surtout du fait de l'avancée technologique d'Intel® avec les Processeurs de série Z37xx qui correspondaient 
à  nos besoins). Cela nous a fait réaliser que ce smartphone pouvait donc remplir en même temps la fonction de PC et celle de smartphone, puisqu'il peut fonctionner sous n'importe quel système d'exploitation d'architecture x86 (windows 8.1 ou les versions précédentes, toute distribution Linux et même Android-x86).<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/544390/files/20140430030611-perform_et_fonc.png?1398852371"" src="""" style=""width: 1042.87px; height: 188px;""/><b>Imaginez tout votre environnement informatique tenant dans votre poche.</b>
<br/><br/>De fil en aiguille, en travaillant sur son design et ses éventuelles fonctionnalités, nous sommes arrivés 
à  conclure qu'il est finalement judicieux d'en faire un smartphone haut de gamme avec le meilleur de ce qui se fait dans l'industrie des smartphones et en même temps la puissance et la fonctionnalité d'un PC. Pour un meilleur confort d'affichage en mode PC, nous avons imaginé un 
écran tactile 12"" exploitant la technologie video-sans-fil pour la video et l'audio (en WIDI grâce au processeur Intel® et/ou en Miracast) et la fonction touch 
à  travers le Bluetooth. Ainsi l'utilisateur pourra exploiter ce smartphone comme PC pour retrouver son univers d'applications et logiciel tournant sous le système d'exploitation qu'il préfère. Une exploitation sur le smartphone lui même ou sur le dispositif 12"" sans fil quand vous 
êtes en déplacement, ou sur n'importe quel dispositif HDMI (TV, projecteur, moniteur...) juste en débranchant la clé WIDI ou Miracast du dispositif 12"" et en la branchant sur un autre dispositif HDMI, 
à  la maison, à  l'université ou au bureau.Nous avons aussi imaginé une multitude de fonctions exploitables grâce aux nombreux capteurs, telle que la mesure des 
épaisseurs d'objets ou les profondeurs grâce au capteur ultrasonique et une application spécifique. Ou le capteur de température et d'humidité ainsi que le capteur ultrasonique pour des exploitations médicales par le biais d'une application sur laquelle on travaille.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/544395/files/20140430031007-modularity.png?1398852607"" src="""" style=""""/><b><br/></b><p></p><p><b>Il n'y a plus aucune limite ou contrainte

L'idée de départ 
était de concevoir le smartphone le plus sécurisé sur les réseaux mobiles. Partant d'un concept sur lequel on a travaillé depuis plus de deux années et pour lequel on a déposé une requête de brevet, nous avons imaginé l'architecture de ce smartphone, et suite 
à  l'avancée de nos recherches, il nous a paru plus que nécessaire qu'il soit d'architecture Intel® x86 (surtout du fait de l'avancée technologique d'Intel® avec les Processeurs de série Z37xx qui correspondaient 
à  nos besoins). Cela nous a fait réaliser que ce smartphone pouvait donc remplir en même temps la fonction de PC et celle de smartphone, puisqu'il peut fonctionner sous n'importe quel système d'exploitation d'architecture x86 (windows 8.1 ou les versions précédentes, toute distribution Linux et même Android-x86).Imaginez tout votre environnement informatique tenant dans votre poche.
De fil en aiguille, en travaillant sur son design et ses éventuelles fonctionnalités, nous sommes arrivés 
à  conclure qu'il est finalement judicieux d'en faire un smartphone haut de gamme avec le meilleur de ce qui se fait dans l'industrie des smartphones et en même temps la puissance et la fonctionnalité d'un PC. Pour un meilleur confort d'affichage en mode PC, nous avons imaginé un 
écran tactile 12"" exploitant la technologie video-sans-fil pour la video et l'audio (en WIDI grâce au processeur Intel® et/ou en Miracast) et la fonction touch 
à  travers le Bluetooth. Ainsi l'utilisateur pourra exploiter ce smartphone comme PC pour retrouver son univers d'applications et logiciel tournant sous le système d'exploitation qu'il préfère. Une exploitation sur le smartphone lui même ou sur le dispositif 12"" sans fil quand vous 
êtes en déplacement, ou sur n'importe quel dispositif HDMI (TV, projecteur, moniteur...) juste en débranchant la clé WIDI ou Miracast du dispositif 12"" et en la branchant sur un autre dispositif HDMI, 
à  la maison, à  l'université ou au bureau.Nous avons aussi imaginé une multitude de fonctions exploitables grâce aux nombreux capteurs, telle que la mesure des 
épaisseurs d'objets ou les profondeurs grâce au capteur ultrasonique et une application spécifique. Ou le capteur de température et d'humidité ainsi que le capteur ultrasonique pour des exploitations médicales par le biais d'une application sur laquelle on travaille.Il n'y a plus aucune limite ou contrainte 
à  votre smartphoneGrâce à  ce smartphone, vous pourrez non seulement choisir votre système d'exploitation mais aussi la capacité mémoire RAM ou même la mémoire de stockage SSD puisqu'il vous serra possible de les changer vous même si vous décidez de les augmenter. Rendant ainsi possible d'atteindre jusqu'à  4Go de RAM et jusqu'à  1To de SSD.Vous n'aurez plus 
à  vous soucier de la compatibilité matériel de votre smartphoneVous pourrez utiliser avec ce smartphone n'importe quel périphérique USB (pareil que sur un ordinateur) grâce 
à  son port USB-3 taille standard.Qui des deux sera le plus rapide ? le transfert de vos données ou leur traitement ?Pour le réseau, ce smartphone serra 
équipé de la puissance du wifi 5G. Pour les réseaux mobiles, la puissance de deux Modem Intel® XMM 7160 LTE 4G. Le choix d'intégrer deux modem nous est imposé pour adapter la solution de sécurité réseaux mobiles sur laquelle on travaille, néanmoins ceci permettra d'atteindre des débits impressionnants sur les réseaux mobiles.
La sécurité au plus fin détailNous avons pensé à  y intégrer un système d'identification par reconnaissance de l'iris pour renforcer la sécurisation du dispositif et l'ouverture 
à  des transactions plus sures (moyen de paiement). Nous pensons 
à  préserver la nature en réduisant la consommation d'énergie mais aussi en utilisant les 
énergies renouvelables.En plus d'une gestion améliorée de la consommation 
énergétique et de la faible consommation en énergie des composants d'Intel®, nous avons aussi pensé 
à  intégrer sur le dos de l'écran tactile sans fil 12"", un panneau photovoltaà¯que, 
qui permettra de recharger non seulement l'écran 12"" mais aussi le smartphone.Un concentré de technologies dans un dispositif 5""Processeur : Intel Z3770 Quad-Core Up to 2.39 GHz 2 MB cach. Intel® Identity Protection Technology

écran tactile sans fil (qui sont l'objet de cette campagne de Crowdfunding) et des travaux sur la solution de sécurité sur les réseaux mobiles. Les travaux sur cette solution de sécurité ne sont pas concernés par la campagne de crowdfunding. Cependant la conception du smartphone est 
étudiée de telle sorte qu'il soit compatible avec cette solution. En nous aidant 
à  réaliser ce smartphone, vous nous aidez certainement aussi à  avancer dans tous nos travaux. A titre d'information seulement : La solution de sécurité sur laquelle on travaille vise 
à  protéger l'identité et la vie privée des usagers des réseaux mobiles en assurant un total anonymat sur ces réseaux, 
à  protéger les communications (voix, sms et toutes autres data) contre leur interception et contre toute forme de géolocalisation.************************************************************************Ce dont nous avons besoin :Nous avons bien avancé mais nous manquons de finance et le montant que nous cherchons 
à  atteindre permettra de financer le reste de la phase développement et conception, la fabrication des prototypes d'essais puis la phase de production en masse. Si nous n'avons pas opté pour le parcellement des finances par phase, c'est parce qu'on ne voudrait pas 
être bloqué après une des phase et ne pas pouvoir honorer nos engagements avec vous. Pour l'instant, nous avons le soutien technique d'Intel® et un partenaire solide qui est eInfochips®, une entreprise reconnue technologique et d'innovation. Il n'y a aucune raison, sauf financière, pour que le projet 
échoue, parce que tous les aspects techniques sont maà®trisées. Les seules choses manquantes maintenant 
à  la réalisation sont les fonds et votre soutien. En remerciementNous avons choisi, en remerciement pour votre soutien, des contreparties fonctionnelles et en lien avec notre projet. Nous sommes persuadés que vous comprenez que ce n'est pas par la valeur de ces contreparties, qu'on vous témoigne notre gratitude. La plus petite de vos contributions témoigne de l'intérêt que vous portez 
à  notre projet et cela pour nous est la plus grande satisfaction. Encore plus grande sera notre joie quand nous atteindrons le but de cette campagne et quand nous honorerons nos engagements envers tout le monde. Merci d'avance.

			to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams"".                                                       
			Eleanor Roosevelt The original idea was to design the most secure
			smartphone on mobile networks. Starting from a concept on which we
			have worked for over two years and for which we have filed a
			patent request, we designed the architecture of this smartphone
			and following the progress of our research, we found that it is
			necessary to be Intel ® x86 architecture (especially because of
			the advanced technology of Intel ® Processors Z37xx series that
			matched our needs). It made us realize that this smartphone could
			therefore meet at the same time the function of PC and the
			smartphone, since he could run under any x86 operating system
			(Windows 8.1 or earlier versions, any Linux distribution and even
			Android-x86).Simplicity in design does
			not preclude refinement nor efficiency. More than that ... have
			you ever seen such a complete and powerful solution !
Working
			on its design and potential features , we come to the conclusion
			that it is ultimately wise to make a high-end smartphone with the
			best of what is happening in the smartphones industry and at the
			same time the power and functionality of a PC. For a better
			display in PC mode, we have imagine a 12"" full HD touch
			screen using wireless video technology for video and audio ( with
			Intel® WiDi because the processor ability, and/or Miracast) and
			touch function through Blue-tooth. Thus the user can use this
			smartphone as a PC, finding his software universe which run under
			the operating system he prefer. The use on the smartphone itself
			or on the 12 "" wireless device when you're traveling, or on
			any HDMI device (TV, projector, monitor ... ) just by unplugging
			the key WIDI or Miracast from the 12"" device and plugging on
			another HDMI device, at home, college or office.
We have
			also devised a multitude of usable functions through many sensors,
			such as-measuring the thickness or the depths of objects with the
			ultrasonic sensor and a specific application. Or the temperature
			sensor and humidity and ultrasonic sensor for medical use by means
			of an application on which we are working.Just do it like
			what you want
With
			this smartphone, you can not only choose your operating system,
			but also the (RAM) memory size or even storage memory SSD size,
			since you can change them yourself if you decide to increase them.
			Making it possible to achieve up to 4GB of RAM and up to 1TB of
			SSD.BYOD experience would never be so practicalYou can use this smartphone with any USB device (similar as on a computer) through its full size USB-3 port.
An amazing network speed

For the
			network, this smartphone will be powered by WiFi 5G. For mobile
			networks, the power of two Intel® XMM 7160 LTE 4G Modems. The
			choice to integrate two modem is imposed on us to meet the network
			mobile security solution on which we work, however this will
			achieve impressive speeds on mobile networks.
With the best security solution

We
			thought to incorporate an identification by iris recognition to
			strengthen the security of the device and for safer transactions
			(as payment solutions).



Let it be ecologic !
In addition to an enhanced energy
			management and the low-power consumption of intel® parts , we
			also thought to include on the back of the 12"" wireless touch
			screen, a photo-voltaic panel, which will not only recharge the
			12"" screen but also the smartphone.

************************************************************************
Note:
			Our work is on two sides, the implementation of the smartphone and
			its second wireless touchscreen (which are the subject of this
			Crowdfunding campaign) on one side and on other side work on the
			mobile network security solution. Work on this security solution
			are not affected by this campaign of crowdfunding, however the
			smartphone is designed the way it is compatible with this
			solution, your help for the implementation of this smartphone
			might also help us to move forward in all our work.
Only for information :
			The security solution on which we work is to protect the identity
			and privacy of mobile users by providing total anonymity on these
			networks, protecting communications (voice, sms and all other
			data) against interception and against any form of Geolocation.
*************************************************************************
What we need :
We have made good progress but we lack funds and
			the amount we are trying to achieve will finance the rest of the
			developement and design, manufacturing and testing prototypes then
			mass production phase. If we do not opt for the crushing of
			finances by phase, it is because we dont want to be blocked after
			any phase and not being able to meet our commitments to you.
At this time we have d'Intel®technical support
			and a strong partner which is eInfochips®, a proven technological
			and inovatif company. There is no reason, but financial one, that
			the project fall, because all technical aspects are mastered. The
			only things missed now to achievement is the fund and your
			support.
 



About rewards :

To
			manifest our gratitude, we have chosen functional rewards and
			related to our project. We are confident that you understand that
			this is not the value of such rewards whom testify our gratitude.
			The smaller of your contributions reflects the interest you have
			shown for our project and it is for us the greatest satisfaction.
			Greater will be our joy when we will reach the goal of this
			campaign and when we will honor our commitments for all. Thank you
			in advance.

Once we've reached our $65,000 goal, we'll press ""go"" and get these Johnnies rolling. The sooner we fund, the sooner your pencil is protected.




   Other Ways You Can Help Not everyone has a pencil, but your friends that do, or plan to buy one, should know about Johnny. You can never be too safe. 



FAQ:



What is Johnny made of?Johnny's body is a PC/ABS blend of plastic for added strength, his middle is a threaded stainless-steel ring and he has soft cushioning foam material on both ends inside.
What does Johnny weigh?Johnny weighs less than 1/10th of a lb
Does it matter which way the tip is facing when I put it in the case?No
Can I charge the pencil while it is in the case?No
Why does Johnny screw together v. use magnets?This is for the protection of your Pencil. We wanted to make sure that he stays shut when you want him to. Magnets also attract ferrous crud in your bag or drawer or whatever that we want to keep away from the pencil.
Is Johnny a perfect circle all the way around?Yes, as perfect as we can make it.


Can I put other things in Johnny?You can do whatever you want with your Johnny.
Will Johnny come in any other colors?Depends on how many Johnny’s backers bring into the world *hint hint*
Do I need to charge Johnny?No, he’s delightfully analog.",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Wall Measure bundles our industrial grade distance measurement sensor with common smart phones to enable quick acquisition of multiple wall measurements in a simple click.  Measures are stored in the phone and/or in the cloud and you can access them anytime and from anywhere by simple clicks on pictures.  You can also share them with others instantly and effortlessly, with no possibility of mistakes or misunderstanding!

Extra Development
Our second goal is to develop a web application that will use multiple shots to generate simple 3D CAD files to be used with your favorite CAD program.If we raise more than 300,000 USD we will develop a subscription-based online service called ""Wall Measure to CAD"".  We will provide all supporters (levels ""Pioneer"" and above) with a free 1-year unlimited subscription!  

Development timeline

Wall Measure leverages our existing Teraranger sensor, so we can deliver within a  tight time frame.

Like any city, growth and opportunity go hand in hand.Shop in your local area or other cities, easily find what you need. We are empowering the real shopping experience so you can find local boutiques and stores in your area like Los Angeles, Hollywood, or other cities in the future!Allows you to shop with friends, exchange rewards, and make new friends. We’re taking the
online shopping experience and ramping it up a few notches. In NueCity, you now
have a way to share your shopping experiences with your friends and family. Get their opinions before you buy that paisley sweater or that spiked dog
collar. And if you buy something in NueCity, you will be rewarded with
discount ‘badges’ and other cool ways to save money.Earn rewards from your favorite brand like never before. 
Why should shopping be
a solitary experience? Let the joy of spending money and earning rewards be a
new kind of experience.Shop and checkout in the same app.A lot of the shopping apps or e-commerce competitors redirect the user to another website in order to checkout. Most of the time they require the user to register a new account. We found that very complicated and not user-friendly so we've created an easy checkout system where you can easily purchase your items. Where we are at.We've worked extremely hard to develop our system with limited resources, that's why we need a little more capital to make NueCity an even more vibrant and
wondrous place. We’re so close, designs are done, and our virtual world is
ready to launch on iPad. In fact, we’re on the launch pad right now. We just need some
more fuel to get us where we need to go.

<p>BeyondtheGloves.com is a combat sports fitness site that is a fitness tracker with a social edge. Measure, track, and rank yourself; connect with other fighters; and search for opponents at the local, regional, or national level!!!</p>
<p>Mission</p>
<p>The mission of BeyondtheGloves.com is to foster a community of combat fighters who are willing to share their experience and experiences and to promote communication and interaction within the combat fighting community. Whether you’re training in Boxing, MMA, Muay Thai, Karate, or another combat sport, BeyondtheGloves.com empowers the fighter by putting an extensive database at the fingertips of the fighter.</p>
<p>Unique Problem<br/><br/> Currently, there are no web sites aimed at tracking workouts for combat sports.  In addition, if a fighter is looking to train or spar, the trainer or coach in your gym will ask around or call other gyms/clubs looking to match you up with a fighter who (hopefully) has a similar skill set. This is all done by word of mouth. The fighter puts their faith into the trainer or coach to find a suitable opponent.<br/><br/> Unique Solution<br/><br/> BeyondtheGloves.com empowers the fighter by letting them track all of their skill sets and workouts on our website (more on that later).  The fighter can then conduct their own research by utilizing BeyondtheGloves.com’s unique search function and extensive database to find another fighter that fits their weight, fight experience, and skill set criteria. </p>
<p>Example of how BeyondtheGloves.com works:<br/><br/> If I am an MMA fighter that has a very strong ground game, but I am looking to improve my stand up attacks, I could use the BeyondtheGloves.com search function to find a fighter that has a strong stand up game.  Once I find that unique fighter, I can view their bio which will include their workout stats and statistics. Then I can contact them to either set up a training session, a sparring match, or to just exchange ideas on how to improve.<br/><br/> Here is an example of the search criteria a Boxer or an MMA fighter could use on BeyondtheGloves.com:<br/><br/> I am looking for a Male, between 140-145lbs, between 5’7 and 5’9, less than 1 year experience, less than 10 sanctioned bouts, southpaw, within 20 miles.<br/><br/> The search criteria would be processed through the database and a list of possible opponents that fit the exact criteria would be displayed along with their bio and contact info.<br/><br/> Fitness Tracker<br/><br/> BeyondtheGloves.com enables the user to create a profile listing all of their vital statistics and a record  of all their workouts which can later be tracked to measure improvement. Customizable and preset workouts allow the fighter to easily select workouts common to combat fighters and provides a database of new and interesting workouts.  BeyondtheGloves.com automatically ranks the fighters in relation to posted workouts allowing the fighter to gauge his progress.

Adapting to these new changes may have been difficult at times. So, we started thinking of ways to make your home office more convenient.There is nothing worse than sitting down in front of your computer and having to struggle for hours with your setup. Our solution was to create a simple and effective device that will streamline your office setup, thereby eliminating stress and frustration.IMAGINE!!! When you are on the go and there is an emergency meeting being called and your device is running out of power. WORRY NOT!!! DockPro is equipped with a 10,000 mAh POWER BANK to give that extra stretch of power for your Laptop/Tablet or cellphone to operate.We have created the ultimate docking station for your laptop.

With 16 practical features, our goal was to make our product hassle-free, versatile, and easy to use. DockPro is specifically designed for universal compatibility. New devices on the market, such as Apple and Huawei are all changing their ports to USB 3.0, this means that most older connectors are rendered useless, such as HDMI, traditional VGA, and AUX ports etc. So picture this, you have just bought a brand new laptop, you take it home and want to plug in your monitor, or an external keyboard and you realize they all have limited USB connectors. This is where DockPro becomes your perfect solution. To make DockPro the best docking hub on the market, we pulled out all the stops. We wanted to make sure that all your devices and connectors could be plugged into DockPro so that you can have a peace of mind. On the docking hub itself, we have a USB-C PD connector that plugs into your USB-C/ThunderBolt port on your laptop to unleashed the full potential of your devices.Extend your devices feature by using DockPro:All of these useful features combined into one will change the way your home office functions.DockPro’s POWER BANK FEATUREWe built-in a smart intelligence switch on the docking station it-self. Should the 'ON' button is engaged the power bank feature is enabled,While off, the docking hub will be enabled and power bank disabled.  Below are the function if the 'ON' button is enabled1. Docking features would be disabled2. Power bank features would be enabled3.

Requirements are high as all necessary features are to be bundled in a portable, sleek and classy chassis. Using high-grade aluminum casing, DockPro would be sturdy and it is able to withstand daily abuse.The LED Battery Indicator on DockPro also indicates the power bank features are enabled. The state-of-the-art wireless charger included is compatible with most of the  Qi wireless devices. The wireless charging feature on DockPro is capable of charging your phone wirelessly even if it is 5 - 8 mm away from the docking hub.A built-in ethernet jack (RJ45) means you can connect a LAN line to your device for better connectivity, DockPro’s ethernet port supports up to 1,000 Mbps! No more battle with weak WI-FI signals!Overheating is a thing of the past thanks to aluminum alloy used in the design of DockPro, this material is an effective heat dissipater that will keep your DockPro cool.Our Prototypes and Sketches!How Cearus Technologies conceptualize DockPro from an idea to a reality. Initial sketches More sketches and testing... After working on our initial sketches and drafts, we finally created a 3D render to see how everything worked in a 360 view and created the DockPro prototype.WORKING PROTOTYPE  

 
HOW IT WILL LOOK LIKE IN 3DRisks and challengesWe have our manufacturer ready and a working prototype. Our planning is extremely well detailed and we are prepared for any possible hiccup that might pop up. However, we will keep you informed every step of the way. Cearus TechnologiesAbout UsCearus Technologies is a Singaporean vehicle created by David and Mark to materialize their ideas on harmonizing technologies to a small package.While the progress of technology has brought tremendous convenience in our everyday lives, the myriad of standards and the diminishing of USB slots allocated in a modern laptop has introduced some burden. Just the other day while preparing for a presentation, David realized he has to carry with him a variety of USB dongles for a simple projector presentation.That’s when DockPo was conceived.With the 16-in-1 Dockpo by Cearus Technologies, we believe that it will meets the high demand usage of connectivity with devices for laptops. By incorporating a power capacity of 10,000mAh, it changes from just a simple USB hub to a dock which allows laptops to be charge on the go.Cearus Technology is targeting to deploy and deliver its innovative ideas to fans and customers by 2021. Its goal is to be one of the trend setters in this new technological era.",37.0,2,"1 Campaign

With all those savings you could treat yo self to a nice dinner once a year courtesy of Cable Pod. When was the last time Apple did that? Mad DurableA new study found that cockroaches and Cable Pods are the only two things that would survive a nuclear apocalypse. ******** Cable Pod is made from a soft-yet-durable polymer that can withstand a rugged journey in your crowded bag or suitcase with ease.Buy Cable Pod once and never replace it – or a lost charger – ever again.We’ll send out a survey after the campaign to confirm your shipping information and the color you would like to receive.Features
Perfect Grip 
Universal Design 
Stackable 
Fast-Action 
Good for Target Practice against the Fridge or Whiteboard 
Durable Chewy Toy for the Puppy
The ProcessThe idea for Cable Pod came about around the time I lost my second pair of headphones this year. We wanted to create a convenient, straightforward solution to a problem a lot of us deal with daily.It’s not the worst thing you’ll deal with on any given day, but we felt the annoyance that comes with finding your headphones tangled in a ball (it happens within seconds every time) or seeing your phone charger fraying is a universally shared feeling.We spent countless hours creating Cable Pod with an intuitive design, durable material, and universal fit for most cables. It works quite well.Disclaimers:*We don't know if The Guinness Book of Records does not keep any sort of cable winding records, but Cable Pod really does wind and unwind in under three seconds.**Cable Pod has no ability to play game shows or chess.***Chuck Norris jokes are really tired. Sorry for this one.****Cold fusion will not be achieved in our lifetime - with or without Cable Pod.*****The government is definitely listening to you, but Cable Pod can't help.******Cable Pod uses magnets to stack. Magic isn't real and the Earth is not flat.*******Cable Pod will not actually solve your personal finance problems. If you're in debt, seek assistance. Honestly.********No studies were commissioned to test the durability of Cable Pod against high levels of radiation. This is quite obviously a joke. Risks and ChallengesOur team of product designers have produced some products that you might already have around the house. We understand the risks of launching new products and because of that we only develop the ones we think will really resonate with you.",13.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<p>We know that there are a lot of situations that a power outlet or USB port are just not available, or maybe you happen to forget to charge your battery pack overnight? Fortunately, nowadays almost EVERYONE has an iPhone. All that energy, just waiting to charge your empty iPhone…</p>
<p>So we set a goal to create the first social charger – one that will allow you to share energy with your friends, and charge your battery while doing it. A couple of weeks later – the first ChargeBite was born.</p>

<h3><img alt=""ChargeBite's advantages"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://chargebite.com/_indiegogo-data/Title-advantages"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>There are a lot of charging solutions out there: chargers based on sunlight, movement, thermoelectric effect, external battery and juice pack cases. Each one is restricted by various constraints. While some require sunlight, others need to be pre-charged.</p>
<p>What's ChargeBite constraint you ask?</p>
<p><strong>ChargeBite just needs 2 friends!</strong> No precharging, no cables and no other special requirement.</p>
<p>Whether you're in a pub, hanging out with some friends, eating at a restaurant or relaxing on the beach, as your iPhone runs out just look in the eyes of your responsible friends and smile embarrassedly… They'll probably agree to share some good ol' precious energy if you ask them nicely :)</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""ChargeBite can be used everywhere"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://chargebite.com/_indiegogo-data/Everywhere"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""ChargeBite can be used everywhere""/></strong></p>

<h3><img alt=""Looking good"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://chargebite.com/_indiegogo-data/Title-looking-good"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>We spent a lot of time and effort perfecting ChargeBite's design. We wanted ChargeBite to not only be pactical and effective but also beautiful and elegant. A device you'll be happy to attach to your keychain. </p>
<p>The design is fashionable, modern and with 3 available color combinations, fits the style and personality of every user. With a diameter of little more than a golf ball and less than half of an inch thick, ChargeBite is small and light enough to easily fit in your pocket.</p>

<h3><img alt=""Efficiency"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://chargebite.com/_indiegogo-data/Title-efficiency"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>Since the day we first thought about a social charging solution, it was obvious that efficiency optimization is critical. Here's how we imp­roved along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first design had 5% to 15% efficiency, which means having to take 15% from each charging iPhone in order to gain 5% battery – ouch.</li>
<li>A lot of reassessment led to changing the concept of our circuitry completely, enhancing the efficiency to 5% to 10%.</li>
<li>further development and were already at  5% to 8%.</li>
</ul><p>After some research we concluded that 5% to 5% is ideal.</p>
<p>We expect serial production to make the efficiency even better, so we'll get even closer to the ideal efficiency, but being good engineers means always seeking for a better solution. So we decided not to rely only on production, and budget some of the funded money just for improving the efficiency rate. </p>

<p>The design is complete and our prototypes work great.  Our suppliers are lined up and ready to pump out some FloCams and Suction Cups.  As soon as we reach our goal on Indiegogo our manufacturing partners have agreed to start production early to speed things up a bit.  We plan to ship out Indiegogo rewards in November 2013 if we can achieve our Indiegogo goal quickly.  If funding takes a long time and we achieve funding on the last day of the Indiegogo project then we will most likely ship in mid December.  Let's hope we are funded early!!</p>
<p>The longest part (and most expensive part) of the production process is making the molds for the plastic parts.  We do this with a partner overseas. There are ten unique parts that will need a mold.  Once we can prove this project will be funded the mold making will begin and should take about 30-45 days to complete.</p>
<p>Once the moulds have been completed the parts can be sent to us very quickly and at a very fast rate.  It will take about 2 weeks after the molds are completed to receive the final parts.</p>
<p>When we receive the final parts will will make sure everything looks good and then start shipping.  If this project is heavily backed then shipping may take a few weeks.  We estimate that we can ship about 500 per week once we start receiving parts from our suppliers.  International shipments may take longer depending on customs procedures / etc.  We plan to use DHL in international shipments because that seems to be the fastest way to send products to countries outside the USA.</p>

What is a Camera Stabilizer?
A good camera stabilizer will flow through the air capturing captivating dynamic footage along the way. We really like the effect that stabilizer shots have in film but we don't like the complexity and bulkiness of the stabilizers on the market today.
Why is the FloCam a Better Solution?
The key functional difference between the Tooga FloCam and other stabilizers is a bendable counterweight arm which allows the operator to not only control the number of stackable weights, but also the weight position.



Changing the weight position means that adjusting the center of gravity is much more intuitive than rigid arm stabilizers where set-up is much more trial and error based.


The Tooga quick snap connection makes set up fast. We spent a lot of time making sure the tolerances are perfect so that the modular design works as good or better than a single piece stabilizer design.


We use a very low-friction u-joint and ball bearing combination to make our gimbal assembly.  The high precision U-Joint is the most critical piece of engineering.  We added a thumbsteer feature that lets the operator make fine tune adjustments on the fly.


Compatible with Any Camera (under 4lbs.)
The FloCam works with cameras ranging from small smart phones to larger DSLR style cameras.

<p></p></div>","Final Production Version May Very As We Continue To Make Adjustments. Bluetooth technology has been around for quite some time and has been used in many different devices. Headphones continue to use this technology but not many have explored the possibility of earbuds. We have been working closely with a factory that is experienced in bluetooth technology and works directly with major brands in order to help bring these earbuds to our market.   We want to sell an earbud that has no cords, clips or adapters and contains everything you need within the wire. We decided to find a way to bring the POWER-LINES to reality and to do this we need the support of backers like you.OUR GOALS:-Connect to any Bluetooth device-Allow users to create a custom fitting earbud. No two people are the same and in reality, no two ears are the same either! So why should any two ears be limited to a “one size fits all” earbud? We are offering custom comfort - mix and match six buds and four tabs to create the perfect fit.-Direct the sound into the ear. The majority of earbuds send the sound directly into the side of your head. For a cleaner and more clear sound we are using earbuds that are designed with a slight angle. This angle channels sound waves directly into your ear.-Lose the cord. Why? It gets in the way!-User friendly. Electronic devices are cool but only if they are easy to use. Simply hold the power button down and connect directly to your Bluetooth device. The POWER-LINES contain everything needed to function.
-Built in battery that easily recharges with USB clip.
-Microphone built into earbud that allows you to make and receive calls just like any other bluetooth headset.
-Includes built in play, pause, and volume controls.



 
we are currently working on additional attachments when customizing the fit.
TIMELINE:
Taking on a project like this requires a lot of time and planning in order to successfully accomplish everything. We were able to find a manufacturer who has been willing to help with creating samples as we move to our final product.
-January-
Our goal is to run the project during this time as we finalize device requirements and continue with testing to insure we can provide a quality product.
-February-
If all goes as planned and we are able to successfully raise the funds to finish the project, we will be able to use the funds to start the production of the first batch of earbuds. Another portion will go into product packaging. This is another project in itself that we are working on in order to provide a clean finished product.
-March-
According to the timeframe we were presented, our order should be in transit to our location. We will use this time to prepare our backer rewards so that when they do arrive, we can be ready to ship them out.
-April-
This is our goal for fulfilling rewards!

Are we too confident? No, not at all! Combining the integration of magnets and a striking and functional design, we come up with a product that can be used in any environment, in a safe and funny way. The unique experience of enjoying our favorite music at a countless number of places and environments allows us to make this statement.This project main goals are to make the experience of music reproduction more enjoyable and fun, as well as to create a product with good quality at a fair price. For that, we’ve inspired ourselves through several ways that allow amplifying sound, and through situations in which we can find music and its intimate and social features.NOLA’s versatility allows you to enjoy your music at home, at the office, outdoors (as long as the weather is fine!), and even when (you'r triyng to impress your friends with a basic ollie)! It's up to you! So, go out and be loud!The shape, inspired by a mix of a saxophone and an elephant trunk, has been duly tested and optimized for amplifying results of up to 15dB of volume.The inner part also receives superficial polishing to maximize the amplification of sound of your smartphone. NOLA is an acoustic amplifier based on the passive principle, which means it does not use external energy sources to amplify the sound. The sinuous and fluid form of the piece allows the abrupt acceleration of sound waves, which allows the increase of sound volume. Structurally we looked for a way that would naturally amplify the sound, such as a trumpet or a gramophone. The sound increases in volume because there is a small initial cavity in the part, ending in an opening that is exponentially larger than the initial one.To assure your smartphone's safety and the correct functioning of NOLA, we've integrated magnets - in the back side - that can bear a weight of 4,2Kg. With this feature, NOLA will adhere to most metallic surfaces. Be aware that copper, aluminium and some steel alloys are not magnetizable. For that reason, we created two accessories so you can enjoy your NOLA experience even when Magneto is in prison, waiting for the Professor, (yes, we love X-Men). To cover as many situations as possible in which NOLA can be used, we designed two complementary accessories, in which design follows the same fundamental premisses: functional design together with the natural beauty of the materials and forms.Table Stand – ideal to use when you are desperate to have a dance break at the office.Wall Stand – the best friend for all of those who like to sing in the shower or like to live up-side down. You can screw it down or, if you'd like, you can stick it with the complementary nano-suction tape that comes with it.Any smartphone within 72mm width x 12mm thickness is compatible with NOLA.Bold people wear it.Charming and tropical people love it.….and trendy and smart people can't live without it.  It all began in a sunny day on a Portuguese beach.

<h1><strong>How it begins</strong></h1>
<p>I am an entrepreneur that have a vision of a better world.  It was about a year ago where I discovered crowed funding websites like indiegogo and <a href=""http://kickstarter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kickstarter.com</a> plateforms that allows me to dream big, and make what was impossible before, possible. </p>
<p>This is my 4th project, also the most promising and biggest project I have so far.  It all begins 8 months ago, simply when I argued with my girlfriend who should go switch off the light when we were both in bed....</p>
<p>This is how the idea of a Bluetooth lightbulb comes to life.  For 8 months, I have been working with my engineer friends, sourcing the right supports and sharing my vision with a group of talented and innovative partners, we are now only steps away from completing the Lumen, it will be the world first RGBW, Bluetooth controlled LED smart bulb.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/31023_366820220074573_1553236445_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/226/771/229be4580a09a4d7be2da7ea522be2bf_large.jpg?1351139630"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h1><strong>What is Lumen</strong></h1>
<p>The Lumen Smart Bulb combines the practical utility of a standard white bulb, the party fun of multi-coloured lights, and the longevity and costs savings of an LED bulb. All of this, within a single package that works with existing standard bulb sockets already in our homes. Everything can be controlled easily from a proprietary application in our mobile smart phone, available for both ios and android devices. </p>
<h1><strong>Not Just a concept</strong></h1>
<p>The Lumen Smart Bulb is more than an idea. Tabu has been developing the Lumen Smart Bulb for some time. With an existing and perfectly functional prototype, the Lumen Smart Bulb is in its final stages - light-years ahead of the competition and a mere two steps away from reality. </p>
<h1><strong>What so special about Lumen?</strong></h1>
<p><strong>RGBW</strong></p>
<p>We never want to create a gadget or a decoration.  We want to create something that is truly useful in our daily life.  That why we created the RGBW LED light. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/226/769/643b25aeba2fa7b030c0ef04667d65aa_large.jpg?1351139560"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>‘W’ represents white. Unlike the usual RGB lightbulb which mimic ""white"" light by combining RED, GREEN and BLUE light, The Lumen has included 6 Watt white LED light that generates over 400 lumens of light. It create a perfect warm-white light that is great for daily usage. </p>
<p>‘RGB’ stands for Red, Blue and Green. The Lumen Smart Bulb can create light in absolutely any color one fancies from the full color spectrum. </p>
<h1><strong>Power saving and long lasting</strong></h1>
<p>400 lumens is the equivalent of a traditional 60W lightbulb, at an unbelievable one-tenth of the power consumption, Lumen is able to create the same amount of light, translating to obvious electricity savings. </p>
<p>The Lumen Smart Bulb is LED and rated to 30,000 hours, or 20 years*, say goodbye to frequent bulb changes.</p>
<h1><strong>Bluetooth 4.0 Controls</strong></h1>
<p>Why Bluetooth 4.0?  BT 4.0 is the new trend and they are available in all the new apple device and the new Android models.  It allow to establish a direct interaction between the device and Lumen, which just make everything so much easier.  Unlike the previous bluetooth version, pairing is done in a very fast a automatic manners.  Bluetooth 4.0 also have the advantage of multi control capabilities and with a range of up to 30ft, you control all the Lumen bulbs in your home right from the palm of your hand whether you’re in the bed room or the living room. </p>

<h1><strong>Cool features</strong></h1>
<div><strong>We have now developed our proprietary application that lets you control all the Lumen Smart Bulbs at home (or a selection of them) from your mobile smart phone.  We have include additional cool features like:</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Party mode</strong> transforms your living room into a dance floor with flashing lights that change color to suit the music playing. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/226/767/cddcce421da66ab763752c034b274331_large.jpg?1351139468"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Sleep mode </strong>simulates calming moonlight to improve sleep and enhance rest.</p>
<p><strong>Wake mode</strong> starts very dim, gradually getting brighter till it reaches maximum intensity at the stipulated wake up time, just tell Lumen how long you want the process to take, 5 minutes or even an hour. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/226/765/dd37907433038c95ea8d2c0f4e3be1d6_large.jpg?1351139439"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<p>When time goes by, we will add additional features to our application. :-) </p>
<h1><strong>Simple, Easy, Plug and Play</strong></h1>
<p>Existing market solutions for advanced lighting systems that try to do what the Lumen will do require complex wiring and clunky control boxes fixed at a certain point in the home, and are expensive. </p>
<p>The Lumen Smart Bulb works with existing standard E27 and E26 bulb sockets. It’s a truly plug and go system that’s affordable and absolutely easy to install. Simply screw it in place of your existing bulb, and its ready to be controlled from the app in your smart phone. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/226/785/484a3bdea6c19f3eb04a8e79c8406ce1_large.jpg?1351140250"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The bluetooth module built into every bulb means that, no routers or complicated configuring is required, nor will you require an additional remote control for your radio frequency controlled bulbs. </p>
<h1><strong>Why Crowed Funding?</strong></h1>
<p>This is my 4th projects posted on a crowed funding website, I have experienced some of the best community support from the backers.  Both good comments and constructive advice, allow me to build better product.  Creating a product is difficult with many challenges.  Sometime, supports from a community is what get me going and be more determine. </p>

</div></div>","How it begins
I am an entrepreneur that have a vision of a better world.  It was about a year ago where I discovered crowed funding websites like indiegogo and kickstarter.com plateforms that allows me to dream big, and make what was impossible before, possible. 
This is my 4th project, also the most promising and biggest project I have so far.  It all begins 8 months ago, simply when I argued with my girlfriend who should go switch off the light when we were both in bed....
This is how the idea of a Bluetooth lightbulb comes to life.  For 8 months, I have been working with my engineer friends, sourcing the right supports and sharing my vision with a group of talented and innovative partners, we are now only steps away from completing the Lumen, it will be the world first RGBW, Bluetooth controlled LED smart bulb.


What is Lumen
The Lumen Smart Bulb combines the practical utility of a standard white bulb, the party fun of multi-coloured lights, and the longevity and costs savings of an LED bulb. All of this, within a single package that works with existing standard bulb sockets already in our homes. Everything can be controlled easily from a proprietary application in our mobile smart phone, available for both ios and android devices. 
Not Just a concept
The Lumen Smart Bulb is more than an idea. Tabu has been developing the Lumen Smart Bulb for some time. With an existing and perfectly functional prototype, the Lumen Smart Bulb is in its final stages - light-years ahead of the competition and a mere two steps away from reality. 
What so special about Lumen?
RGBW
We never want to create a gadget or a decoration.  We want to create something that is truly useful in our daily life.  That why we created the RGBW LED light. 

‘W’ represents white. Unlike the usual RGB lightbulb which mimic ""white"" light by combining RED, GREEN and BLUE light, The Lumen has included 6 Watt white LED light that generates over 400 lumens of light. It create a perfect warm-white light that is great for daily usage. 
‘RGB’ stands for Red, Blue and Green. The Lumen Smart Bulb can create light in absolutely any color one fancies from the full color spectrum. 
Power saving and long lasting
400 lumens is the equivalent of a traditional 60W lightbulb, at an unbelievable one-tenth of the power consumption, Lumen is able to create the same amount of light, translating to obvious electricity savings. 
The Lumen Smart Bulb is LED and rated to 30,000 hours, or 20 years*, say goodbye to frequent bulb changes.
Bluetooth 4.0 Controls
Why Bluetooth 4.0?  BT 4.0 is the new trend and they are available in all the new apple device and the new Android models.  It allow to establish a direct interaction between the device and Lumen, which just make everything so much easier.  Unlike the previous bluetooth version, pairing is done in a very fast a automatic manners.  Bluetooth 4.0 also have the advantage of multi control capabilities and with a range of up to 30ft, you control all the Lumen bulbs in your home right from the palm of your hand whether you’re in the bed room or the living room. 

Cool features
We have now developed our proprietary application that lets you control all the Lumen Smart Bulbs at home (or a selection of them) from your mobile smart phone.  We have include additional cool features like:
 
 
Party mode transforms your living room into a dance floor with flashing lights that change color to suit the music playing. 

Sleep mode simulates calming moonlight to improve sleep and enhance rest.
Wake mode starts very dim, gradually getting brighter till it reaches maximum intensity at the stipulated wake up time, just tell Lumen how long you want the process to take, 5 minutes or even an hour. 

Ambient mode creates the perfect conditions for a romantic date or a quiet evening at home.

When time goes by, we will add additional features to our application. :-) 
Simple, Easy, Plug and Play
Existing market solutions for advanced lighting systems that try to do what the Lumen will do require complex wiring and clunky control boxes fixed at a certain point in the home, and are expensive. 
The Lumen Smart Bulb works with existing standard E27 and E26 bulb sockets. It’s a truly plug and go system that’s affordable and absolutely easy to install. Simply screw it in place of your existing bulb, and its ready to be controlled from the app in your smart phone. 

The bluetooth module built into every bulb means that, no routers or complicated configuring is required, nor will you require an additional remote control for your radio frequency controlled bulbs. 
Why Crowed Funding?
This is my 4th projects posted on a crowed funding website, I have experienced some of the best community support from the backers.  Both good comments and constructive advice, allow me to build better product.  Creating a product is difficult with many challenges.  Sometime, supports from a community is what get me going and be more determine. 
What is the Funding for?
We have clear plan and well evaluated the cost of the product down to the individual component.
Preproduction Cost:

Ordering Prototypes for testing: $5000
Safety certificate application (CE, UL, TUV): $25,000
Initial Software and Engineering deign fee: $30,000
Other License cost: $8,000

Production Cost:
Hardware Tooling: $10,000
Minimum Order Quantity: $12,000
shipping, handleing and other cost: $10,000
Total $100,000

<p>During last few years, population of digital storage device like  SD, MicroSD, and USB drives kept on increasing on my desk. More memory device I acquired, more I misplaced causing lot of frustration. I couldn't find a solution  that organized my storage devices while giving me quick access to them, I was looking for something that was designed well enough to deserve a spot on my desk thus with support from my friends and family, my dad and I  came up with a simple, yet well designed, MicroSD, and USB memory organizer called VeeHub. So today my dad and I are launching the VeeHub.</p>
<p><strong>Presenting the VeeHub</strong></p>
<p>The VeeHub is a beautiful device that organizes 5 USB drives, 8 SD cards, and 11 MicroSD cards. It is made from high quality ABS plastic (same as plastic used in LEGO®) providing great strength ensuring that it won’t break no matter how hard it falls off your desk. The VeeHub is weighted evenly so that USB drives won't tip it over. It uses space efficiently, storing 24 memory device in a small footprint. It looks beautiful, and is worth displaying by itself on a desk.</p>

<p><b>What is this all about?</b></p>
<p>As part of the
501st Legion (biggest Star Wars costuming club worldwide) I wanted to do an
imperial officer costume. Part of the costume are the so called “imperial code
cylinders”. In the first three Star Wars movies (1977-1983) they used radiation
dosimeters, but today these dosimeters are very rare and hard to come by and
most of the time very expansive, so I thought about creating a replica and when
I took the dimensions I realized that it had the perfect size for an USB-stick.
In-universe the code cylinders are for data transportation and security codes –
a perfect fit if you ask me! </p>

I just want to do this and already put much effort into this project, but I
can’t do it all on my own. The molds for the stick and production-costs (almost all

<h3>Booster</h3>
<p><b>My story</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The history of developing Booster is closely related to my smartphone. When I was traveling and I wanted to listen to music, connect to the Internet or even if I tried to use the GPS, my battery always got discharged very fast. So I started thinking how to increase the operating time of my phone. Of course, there were a lot of power banks or solar chargers in the market, that´s true. BUT. Each of them needs a recharging cable. As I am a forgetful man, that was absolutely nothing for me. Then I got the idea of making something similar to a watchband, but with a charging cable integrated to one of the bands.</p>

Booster
My story

The history of developing Booster is closely related to my smartphone. When I was traveling and I wanted to listen to music, connect to the Internet or even if I tried to use the GPS, my battery always got discharged very fast. So I started thinking how to increase the operating time of my phone. Of course, there were a lot of power banks or solar chargers in the market, that´s true. BUT. Each of them needs a recharging cable. As I am a forgetful man, that was absolutely nothing for me. Then I got the idea of making something similar to a watchband, but with a charging cable integrated to one of the bands.

Design
Booster is the first wrist solar charger, which can be also used as a power bank. It can help you everywhere and every time you need to charge or boost you smartphone's battery.




Booster is not only a wrist solar charger or a fashion accessory, but primarily your personal rescuer in sudden situations when the battery in your smartphone is almost discharged and you have to make an important call, check the web or use the GPS urgently.

Booster is really the first one wrist solar charger, You can't find a similar product in any market around the world!

Materials
Booster is made from harmless materials. The shell is made of zinc alloy with the surface plating ""Black Nickel"". This gives the impression of a really robust and strong case. Actually it is also good for the electronics inside, because it´s perfectly protected.



The shell is made of zinc alloy, thickness of walls 1.5mm


Bottom is made of stainless stell with 2mm thickness.



Bands are made from 100% silicone, this material is pleasant to touch.

<p>The heart of the BlackSquare Enigma is our patented, Hardware Cryptographic Module, or HCM. Years of engineering, programming, coding, testing and debugging have gone into the development of BlackSquare Enigma. The patented HCM chipset is now in its 9th generation of development.</p>
<p>Versions of BlackSquare Enigma have been sold into government agencies and large enterprise customers, where encryption of data-at-rest is both critical and required by law. </p>
<p>Compatible with both WIN and MAC operating systems and all USB protocols, BlackSquare Enigma is a complex, hardened and proven security device that’s intuitive and really simple to use. </p>

<p><b>Find encrypted files using the 'search' function on both WIN and MAC</b></p>
<p>Using BlackSquare Enigma, encrypted files and folders are easy to recognize. The small icon identifying the default program for each file changes to a black square with a “b²” in it and an additional file extension<b> -- .BKSQ (for BlackSquare) – will be added.</b></p>

<p><b>To find encrypted files, simply search the filename, or  *.BKSQ!</b></p>
<p><b>BlackSquare Enigma is transparent to the Operating System </b></p>
<p>When you remove Enigma from your computer, all Enigma windows automatically disappear. All the recovery keys needed to decrypt your files reside within Enigma’s hardened security, not on your computer. No data is left behind for cyber thieves to use in their attempts to decrypt your files.</p>

<p>BlackSquare's Enigma encrypts and protects files on <b>any</b> storage device that can be seen by your computer -- internal drives, external drives, servers, NAS boxes and cloud storage applications.  </p>
<p>IT, Security and encryption experts alike agree hardware encryption is faster and less vulnerable than software-based encryption. Until now, the problem has been finding a hardware solution that is easy to understand and simple to use.  </p>
<p>BlackSquare's Enigma is FIPS-140-2
certified and comes with very strong AES-256-CBC encryption, and has been
certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and
Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE). </p>

<p>BlackSquare has implemented a two-factor-authentication (2FA) model using passwords. If the Enigma and your data -- your laptop, for example -- are stolen together, a cyber thief would need both your LOGON password and your file recovery password(s) to gain access to your encrypted files. </p>
<p>Multiple variations of 2FA are currently being used by government agencies and the medical, financial and insurance industries. </p>

If you have data you need to protect, you should own an Enigma!

Using BlackSquare Enigma, no one can decrypt your confidential data - EVER!

Every so often, a truly compelling and innovative product comes along that disrupts traditional technology in a positive way. BlackSquare Technologies Enigma is one of these products.

BlackSquare Enigma has the look and feel of a thumb drive, but it's NOT a thumb drive! 
Enigma is a USB hardware encryption & decryption device. Enigma doesn’t store data. It encrypts files and folders on your computer, external drives, or in the cloud.  
Enigma is the first and only patented, real-time USB hardware encryption and decryption device available to the consumer.

Cyber attacks have become more prevalent, sophisticated and costly. You never know who's looking at your data. Whether your data is stored on your hard drive, an external storage device or in the cloud, it’s more vulnerable than ever. Laptops and thumb drives can be lost or stolen. Networks and cloud storage apps can be penetrated and compromised. 
BlackSquare Enigma is a simple, safe and secure way to protect your data from these potentially damaging threats.



If you know how to find and select files on your computer, you already know how to use BlackSquare Enigma. It’s that intuitive.
(Check out the Windows and MAC demo videos to see for yourself how Enigma works.)
Just plug your Enigma along with any USB storage device into a USB port on your computer, log in and you’re good to go. Enigma’s home page shows your desktop, folders, documents and all your drives. Navigating to find and manage files and folders is a snap. 

Your BlackSquare Enigma will go through an initialization process the first time you use it. It takes a minute or two. This process consists of connecting an external USB storage device to your Enigma and plugging the pair into your PC or MAC.
You will be asked to initialize your Enigma. Click OK. Then create a strong password up to 32 characters in length. This will become your LOGON password. And the initialization of your Enigma is complete.
If you lose your Enigma, simply replace it (you’re not S-O-L). Once you have initialized your new Enigma and recreated your LOGON password, you are good to go. 
Encrypt files that are of value to you. You can encrypt one file, multiple files, a single folder or multiple folders, all with a single click. You can encrypt and protect every file on your computer or within your network.  

The heart of the BlackSquare Enigma is our patented, Hardware Cryptographic Module, or HCM. Years of engineering, programming, coding, testing and debugging have gone into the development of BlackSquare Enigma. The patented HCM chipset is now in its 9th generation of development.
Versions of BlackSquare Enigma have been sold into government agencies and large enterprise customers, where encryption of data-at-rest is both critical and required by law. 
Compatible with both WIN and MAC operating systems and all USB protocols, BlackSquare Enigma is a complex, hardened and proven security device that’s intuitive and really simple to use. 

Find encrypted files using the 'search' function on both WIN and MAC
Using BlackSquare Enigma, encrypted files and folders are easy to recognize. The small icon identifying the default program for each file changes to a black square with a “b²” in it and an additional file extension -- .BKSQ (for BlackSquare) – will be added.

To find encrypted files, simply search the filename, or  *.BKSQ!
BlackSquare Enigma is transparent to the Operating System 
When you remove Enigma from your computer, all Enigma windows automatically disappear. All the recovery keys needed to decrypt your files reside within Enigma’s hardened security, not on your computer. No data is left behind for cyber thieves to use in their attempts to decrypt your files.
BlackSquare Enigma:

Is compatible with both Windows (XP and newer) and MAC OS X (thru 10.8.x) operating systems, both 32-and 64-bit
Encrypts data using AES-256-CBC
Is compatible with all USB protocols 

Encrypts data on internal and external drives, and cloud storage applications

Drag ‘n Drop, or Right Click – your choice! 
BlackSquare has provided a complete menu of features for both File and Folder operations. Use 'right-click' for menu driven options, or, drag the files or folders and drop them on the appropriate icon at the top of the page.    

BlackSquare Folder (left pane)and File (right pane) menus, using our right-click menu


BlackSquare's Enigma encrypts and protects files on any storage device that can be seen by your computer -- internal drives, external drives, servers, NAS boxes and cloud storage applications.  
IT, Security and encryption experts alike agree hardware encryption is faster and less vulnerable than software-based encryption. Until now, the problem has been finding a hardware solution that is easy to understand and simple to use.  
BlackSquare's Enigma is FIPS-140-2
certified and comes with very strong AES-256-CBC encryption, and has been
certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and
Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE). 

BlackSquare has implemented a two-factor-authentication (2FA) model using passwords. If the Enigma and your data -- your laptop, for example -- are stolen together, a cyber thief would need both your LOGON password and your file recovery password(s) to gain access to your encrypted files. 
Multiple variations of 2FA are currently being used by government agencies and the medical, financial and insurance industries. 

To ensure each BlackSquare Enigma customer has the latest in features and enhancements, BlackSquare will provide an optional subscription update service. The purpose of the update is to provide enhancements and functional updates which have been extensively tested and approved. The BlackSquare development team has developed a road map of planned updates that are scheduled for testing and release in 2014.  
ALL BlackSquare Enigmas will come with the 2014 subscription update service at no charge during this campaign!  Get yours now!

Check out our great Perks. You will receive a hefty discount on the price of your Enigma with your pledge.

Check out our cool T-shirts! (color choices are Orange, Royal Blue and Slate Grey)


BlackSquare Enigma's simplicity, ease of use and exceptional security allow you to encrypt and protect your valuable data! It's truly an innovative and affordable product that can work for anybody in any application.
If you'd like to protect your data, you need an Enigma. Your support will help us to launch Enigma into the marketplace. 
Be sure to spend a few minutes watching our videos and checking out the pix.  Please ask questions. We want to earn your business because we feel that BlackSquare Enigma is a remarkable product.

<br/>Frequently changing your light bulbs may become a thing of the past. The LimitlessLED technology demonstrates up to 50,000 hours of useful life per smartbulb, which could mean changing your lightbulbs just two or three times in a lifetime.<br/> </h2>
<h2>The new lightbulbs are extremely hi-tech, containing both warm white and cool white capability in a single light bulb. The wireless remote allows the user to gradually change between the two colors and every smartbulb has a built in dimming feature that allows the user to remotely control the brightness in both warm white and cool white modes. </h2>

<h2>
<br/> One of the most practical uses for LimitlessLED is its ability to group and switch large zones of multiple smartbulbs from multiple remotes, in many simultaneous combinations. This feature is great when used as a different channel for every room in your home or when used in commercial buildings where each channel can have up to 100 or more bulbs.<br/><br/>
</h2>
<h2>The LimitlessLED bulbs are cold enough to touch, even when at full brightness, therefore safer in young children’s rooms. The smartbulbs are unbreakable, so are safe in bedside lamps that are prone to be knocked over. There will be no more sweeping up broken glass.</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The entire electrical and home automation industry has never before had the luxury of such capabilities in a simple light bulb. There will be no need for expensive installation of wall dimmers, extra wiring, or electrician fees. You just simply swap your existing light bulb.</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The new smartbulb not only performs in efficiency, but delivers in aesthetics and lighting performance. Within the 180degree down and outward field of light produced by the LimitlessLED, the brightness achieved is more than a standard 60W incandescent bulb.  This is more than adequate for recessed lighting, dome lighting, hanging lights and in some cases even chandelier lighting. The high quality 7.5W LimitlessLED bulb easily outshines 60W incandescent bulbs at an equivalent 800Lumens.</h2>

<h1>Create Your Ambience. It's as Easy as Installing an App.</h1>
</div>
<p><strong>Limitless LED is the first affordable wireless LED light bulb built for the 21st century</strong> • You can wirelessly command all the 2.4Ghz wireless Limitless LED lights in your home, controlling the brightness, the ambience, and even switching them on and off. We are using dedicated Warm White LEDs and dedicated Cool White LEDs because we wanted the richest cool whites and warmest whites as possible, unlike RGB where the whites are washed out. We also use solid state memory to keep your settings even when the bulb is removed from the mains socket for example <strong>when you move house if you are renting!</strong> and even keeps settings when the handheld remote batteries are removed. Like most normal TV remotes, our remote also lasts many years on a single set of batteries.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<strong>Design Really Matters</strong>• We have designed a beautifully high tech, smart looking battery operated remote.
<h1>Great design</h1>
<p><strong>Only the best technology •</strong> This is not some cheap direct infrared wireless that you can find in the shops. Nor is it some cheap LED controller that requires transformers for your ceiling lights.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>We are using highspeed 2.4Ghz wireless microchips INSIDE each light bulb.</h3>
<strong>The future is in your hands •</strong>We are also working with Eric Migicovsky and his Pebble smartwatch team to bring you this quick and easy control over your lighting.
<p>Imagine coming home from work and as you enter the GPS area of your house or your local WiFi, your phone gives you a message “Welcome Home, would you like to turn your Lights on?” you press an ok button and the pebble app feeds a message back to the smart box in the home, and turns on the Kitchen and Lounge lights.<br/><br/>As you go to sit down in front of a movie for the evening, you open an app on the Pebble that contains a list of rooms in the house to dim or turn off the lights. You select Lounge lights, and select “Dim Lounge Lights to 50%?”<br/><br/> As you go to bed, and you look at your watch from in bed, and it says “Bedroom Lights Off?” and you select the button on the watch, and it instructs the pebble app to send a command to the http server in the house, and it wirelessly turns off the lights in your room.<br/><br/>“An amazing application of Pebble” - Eric Migicovsky</p>

</div>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>SmartThings needs more ""things"". Before now, it was only destined to control your desk lamps via a battery operated wireless socket, But Now with the wireless Limitless LED you can control your main home lighting via the Limitless Smart base station and SmartThings hub.<br/><br/>Pebble smartwatch has a very bright future.. especially now that it will be able to control your Limitless LED Lights wirelessly.<br/><br/></p>

<h1>The world is opening up. </h1>
<p><strong>Open Standards</strong> • We believe nothing should be tied into one supplier; everyone should integrate and play together. Our smart box uses open standards, and is a totally open platform allowing other future smart lights and other smart devices in the home to communicate with our box. It also uses an opensource operating system so that you can totally customize it to your needs.</p>

<h1>Smoking fast</h1>
<p><strong>Only the fastest technology • </strong>This is not some cheap software thrown together in a few days. We have been refining the software for many months. We take a lot of pride in testing and monitoring the speed and performance after every new introduction of code into our code base. We measure everything down to milliseconds. We love the speed of Google, so we want to ensure the speed of lighting control is also within milliseconds. Our LED technology and software gives instantaneous Full Brightness On, way faster than any incandescent or energy saver bulbs.</p>

<h1>Smarter, Greener – let’s do our part.</h1>
<p><strong>Highest Efficiency • </strong>We didn’t just settle for low efficiency; we aimed high and have designed it at 75Lumen per Watt, which is a great achievement for the latest LED technology. Each Wireless Limitless LED light bulb will last over 50,000 hours according to Limitless Designs LLC Testing Labs, and <strong>Samsung LED testing labs, based on 9,000hrs of testing</strong> and logarithmic extrapolation to L70 (70% LED light performance as per USA industry standard measurement guidelines)<br/><br/>You will <strong>save over $319</strong> in electricity costs per lightbulb <br/><br/>x12 Lightbulbs =<strong> $3828 dollars in SAVINGS!</strong><br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>60Watt Standard LightBulb</strong><br/>1,095hrs (3hrs per day) x 0.060kWh x 11c/kWh = <strong>$7.28</strong><br/><strong>7.5Watt LimitlessLED</strong><br/>1,095hrs (3hrs per day) x 0.0075kWh x 11c/kWh = <strong>$0.90</strong></p>
<p><br/>LED lights contain no toxic material, no mercury nor lead, and can be safely recycled to recover valuable materials, such as copper and aluminum, at the end of their lifespan. LED lights emit no ultraviolet or infrared radiation, which means our bulbs won't damage your artworks, merchandise or artifacts over time.<br/><br/>We tested our LimitlessLED bulbs to extreme conditions in the labs. They are flame and ignition resistant all the way up to 1200DegF and beyond! Cap strength tested at &gt;4000V! Insulation resistance between current-carrying metal parts of the cap and accessible parts of the lamp are &gt;4MegaΩ! The cap remains firmly attached when subjected to torque levels of more than 26.5inch pounds of force!</p>

The LimitlessLED smartbulbs can be controlled from remotely anywhere in your home.


Frequently changing your light bulbs may become a thing of the past. The LimitlessLED technology demonstrates up to 50,000 hours of useful life per smartbulb, which could mean changing your lightbulbs just two or three times in a lifetime. 
The new lightbulbs are extremely hi-tech, containing both warm white and cool white capability in a single light bulb. The wireless remote allows the user to gradually change between the two colors and every smartbulb has a built in dimming feature that allows the user to remotely control the brightness in both warm white and cool white modes. 


 One of the most practical uses for LimitlessLED is its ability to group and switch large zones of multiple smartbulbs from multiple remotes, in many simultaneous combinations. This feature is great when used as a different channel for every room in your home or when used in commercial buildings where each channel can have up to 100 or more bulbs.

The LimitlessLED bulbs are cold enough to touch, even when at full brightness, therefore safer in young children’s rooms. The smartbulbs are unbreakable, so are safe in bedside lamps that are prone to be knocked over. There will be no more sweeping up broken glass.
 
The entire electrical and home automation industry has never before had the luxury of such capabilities in a simple light bulb. There will be no need for expensive installation of wall dimmers, extra wiring, or electrician fees. You just simply swap your existing light bulb.
 
The new smartbulb not only performs in efficiency, but delivers in aesthetics and lighting performance. Within the 180degree down and outward field of light produced by the LimitlessLED, the brightness achieved is more than a standard 60W incandescent bulb.  This is more than adequate for recessed lighting, dome lighting, hanging lights and in some cases even chandelier lighting. The high quality 7.5W LimitlessLED bulb easily outshines 60W incandescent bulbs at an equivalent 800Lumens.
 
• 3 Step Quick and Easy setup for Remotes.


1) Just replace existing light bulbs2) Turn the light bulb on, and within 2 seconds, press the button on the remote you wish to securely syncronize the light bulb with.3) Continue doing this for all lights and all remotes in your home.



or• 3 Step Quick and Easy setup for iOS and Androids.1) Power on the Limitless base station2) Setup WiFi using your web browser3) Run the LimitlessLED App on your smartphone, turn the light bulb on, and within 2 seconds, press the button on the screen you wish to securely syncronize the light bulb with.


GET YOUR PERK NOW.  FOR 4 LimitlessLED is just $18.50 per lightbulb.>>
“I’m still a bit blown away by your light bulbs, after seeing them in action, quite a bit of potential there!” –Roger Shaw, Business Banking Manager.
“Innovative technology that will light our future” –Samsung LED
“I cannot wait so that I can start showing it to my contacts” – Ken, JPMorgan Chase, Business Banking Team.

Create Your Ambience. It's as Easy as Installing an App.

Limitless LED is the first affordable wireless LED light bulb built for the 21st century • You can wirelessly command all the 2.4Ghz wireless Limitless LED lights in your home, controlling the brightness, the ambience, and even switching them on and off. We are using dedicated Warm White LEDs and dedicated Cool White LEDs because we wanted the richest cool whites and warmest whites as possible, unlike RGB where the whites are washed out. We also use solid state memory to keep your settings even when the bulb is removed from the mains socket for example when you move house if you are renting! and even keeps settings when the handheld remote batteries are removed. Like most normal TV remotes, our remote also lasts many years on a single set of batteries.

Design Really Matters• We have designed a beautifully high tech, smart looking battery operated remote.
Great design
Only the best technology • This is not some cheap direct infrared wireless that you can find in the shops. Nor is it some cheap LED controller that requires transformers for your ceiling lights.
We are using highspeed 2.4Ghz wireless microchips INSIDE each light bulb.
The future is in your hands •We are also working with Eric Migicovsky and his Pebble smartwatch team to bring you this quick and easy control over your lighting.
Imagine coming home from work and as you enter the GPS area of your house or your local WiFi, your phone gives you a message “Welcome Home, would you like to turn your Lights on?” you press an ok button and the pebble app feeds a message back to the smart box in the home, and turns on the Kitchen and Lounge lights.As you go to sit down in front of a movie for the evening, you open an app on the Pebble that contains a list of rooms in the house to dim or turn off the lights. You select Lounge lights, and select “Dim Lounge Lights to 50%?” As you go to bed, and you look at your watch from in bed, and it says “Bedroom Lights Off?” and you select the button on the watch, and it instructs the pebble app to send a command to the http server in the house, and it wirelessly turns off the lights in your room.“An amazing application of Pebble” - Eric Migicovsky
“The SmartThings iPhone App will be free up to 100 light bulbs and things per hub limit, for Kickstarter backers as a special benefit.” - The SmartThings Team.

Green LED technology meets the Cloud on iPhone.

 
SmartThings needs more ""things"". Before now, it was only destined to control your desk lamps via a battery operated wireless socket, But Now with the wireless Limitless LED you can control your main home lighting via the Limitless Smart base station and SmartThings hub.Pebble smartwatch has a very bright future.. especially now that it will be able to control your Limitless LED Lights wirelessly.
 
Your Infrared TV remote when used with the Android Base station will be able to control your wireless lights, and the Android base station will be able to control your TV via infrared.

The world is opening up. 
Open Standards • We believe nothing should be tied into one supplier; everyone should integrate and play together. Our smart box uses open standards, and is a totally open platform allowing other future smart lights and other smart devices in the home to communicate with our box. It also uses an opensource operating system so that you can totally customize it to your needs.
 

Smoking fast
Only the fastest technology • This is not some cheap software thrown together in a few days. We have been refining the software for many months. We take a lot of pride in testing and monitoring the speed and performance after every new introduction of code into our code base. We measure everything down to milliseconds. We love the speed of Google, so we want to ensure the speed of lighting control is also within milliseconds. Our LED technology and software gives instantaneous Full Brightness On, way faster than any incandescent or energy saver bulbs.
 

Smarter, Greener – let’s do our part.
Highest Efficiency • We didn’t just settle for low efficiency; we aimed high and have designed it at 75Lumen per Watt, which is a great achievement for the latest LED technology. Each Wireless Limitless LED light bulb will last over 50,000 hours according to Limitless Designs LLC Testing Labs, and Samsung LED testing labs, based on 9,000hrs of testing and logarithmic extrapolation to L70 (70% LED light performance as per USA industry standard measurement guidelines)You will save over $319 in electricity costs per lightbulb x12 Lightbulbs = $3828 dollars in SAVINGS!
60Watt Standard LightBulb1,095hrs (3hrs per day) x 0.060kWh x 11c/kWh = $7.287.5Watt LimitlessLED1,095hrs (3hrs per day) x 0.0075kWh x 11c/kWh = $0.90
LED lights contain no toxic material, no mercury nor lead, and can be safely recycled to recover valuable materials, such as copper and aluminum, at the end of their lifespan. LED lights emit no ultraviolet or infrared radiation, which means our bulbs won't damage your artworks, merchandise or artifacts over time.We tested our LimitlessLED bulbs to extreme conditions in the labs. They are flame and ignition resistant all the way up to 1200DegF and beyond! Cap strength tested at >4000V! Insulation resistance between current-carrying metal parts of the cap and accessible parts of the lamp are >4MegaΩ! The cap remains firmly attached when subjected to torque levels of more than 26.5inch pounds of force!
 

LimitlessLED Wireless Smartbulbs are the leading edge technology for LED.

Worldwide base fitting support, get your perks now, we will get your feedback for the style you want at the end of the campaign.

Uses the latest in 2012 Advanced Electronics
This is Limitless Designs version 2 of the LimitlessLED circuitry. Our latest version 3 contains more SamsungLED chips for better heat distribution, supreme longevity, and faster wireless.

 

 

 
 
 

 
NATIVE iPhone and Android Apps
We believe the best performance and responsiveness comes only from native Smartphone apps, meaning you get a separate custom app for iPhone; iPad; Android; and Android Tablets, giving all the latest features designed specifically for each device, not just a slow generic web interface.

<h2>Arduino. LCD. Keypad. Finished. Easy.</h2>
<p>That's the idea behind the Mmintbox.</p>
<p>While there are several molded Arduino enclosures on the market, nothing has yet been available to utilize LCD keypad shields.  We aim to change that.</p>
<h3>The product details:</h3>
<p>The plan is to make a black injection-molded ABS enclosure with a gray silicone keypad.  The internals are strictly off-the-shelf: an LCD keypad shield mated to an Arduino or compatible board.  There are 2 versions to cover the vast majority of LCD keypad shields: The Mmintbox 1 is designed for the DFRobot/Sainsmart/generic eBay shield, and the Mmintbox 2 fits the Adafruit/Sparkfun/Linksprite shield.  Either will take any ""classic"" Arduino board (Uno/Duemilanove/Diecimila/etc.) or an Arduino Mega.  In addition to the electronics, there is also room in the case and locating features for a 9V battery.  A small protoboard is an available option that will fit along side a regular Arduino (will not fit with a Mega).</p>

</div></span></div>","Arduino. LCD. Keypad. Finished. Easy.
That's the idea behind the Mmintbox.
While there are several molded Arduino enclosures on the market, nothing has yet been available to utilize LCD keypad shields.  We aim to change that.
The product details:
The plan is to make a black injection-molded ABS enclosure with a gray silicone keypad.  The internals are strictly off-the-shelf: an LCD keypad shield mated to an Arduino or compatible board.  There are 2 versions to cover the vast majority of LCD keypad shields: The Mmintbox 1 is designed for the DFRobot/Sainsmart/generic eBay shield, and the Mmintbox 2 fits the Adafruit/Sparkfun/Linksprite shield.  Either will take any ""classic"" Arduino board (Uno/Duemilanove/Diecimila/etc.) or an Arduino Mega.  In addition to the electronics, there is also room in the case and locating features for a 9V battery.  A small protoboard is an available option that will fit along side a regular Arduino (will not fit with a Mega).

Mmintbox 1

Exploded view
Current Status:
The basic design is complete in Solidworks.  Several prototypes have been 3D printed to check the function with a DFRobot LCD shield and an Arduino Uno R3. We are continuing to refine the design as we work with our prototypes. 







What we need:
ORDERS! ORDERS! ORDERS!
In order to put the Mmintbox into production, there will be substantial start-up costs:



Injection mold tooling


Per-part charges


Indiegogo & Paypal fees 


Hardware for assembly


SLA prototypes for final design validation


Packaging

Shipping costs

In addition to your orders, we need EXPOSURE!  Spread the word to your hackerspace members, Facebook friends, tech bloggers, internet forum members, Twitter followers, etc.  Even if you can't contribute financially, it doesn't mean you can't help this project succeed!

We've gone to a little extra trouble to make sure there are perks for every contributor at every level.  The Mmintbrownie Recipe and Paper Models are a fun way to say thanks to our smaller contributors, and a nice bonus to everyone ordering hardware.  We're offering enclosures and accesories at several levels; see all the perks at right.

FAQs
What's with the name?
The point of the project is a MINimal INTerface box for a human to interact with an Arduino.  The extra ""M"" is because we learned there is another tech product called Mintbox (a fanless PC running Linux Mint) and we didn't want any confusion.
What if you exceed the funding goal?
We have some ideas for even more cool add-ons for the Mmintbox and would love to add stretch goals!

What if the goal isn't met?
Then there apparently isn't sufficient demand to justify production at this time, and you get your money back.  

Will the Mmintbox enclosures still be available after the funding campaign is over?
That is the plan.  Enough parts will be ordered to allow further orders.  But don't wait around, we need your orders to make this happen!

<h3>Meet Mia</h3>
<p>We've spent months designing and perfecting a service robot that would be useful, strong, personable and last a long time without service and maintenance.  Mia is the culmination of years of Cognitive Scripting (Artificial Intelligence), open source software development, research and planning.  We took months studying the market, buying robots, building robots, testing, using and playing with them, even marveling at work that has been done by other companies and hobbyists alike.  We've solved many of the problems keeping robots from reaching the public on a large commercial scale including affordable pricing. </p>
<h3>No Programming Required!</h3>
<p>We developed Mia to be extremely easy to use, right out of the box.  She comes completely setup and already understands hundreds of commands and recognizes thousands of objects.  There's no programming needed to help Mia learn new actions.  Mia tells you when she doesn't know how to do something and asks you to show her how.  You simply use your smartphone as a remote control to ""show"" Mia how to perform an action.  Once you create an action you save it directly on Mia's onboard Quad Core computer and tell Mia what command will run the action the next time.   That's all.  You can also upload and sell Actions in the Mia Action Store (ready in February 2015). Let's see who can make the best Mia - ""History of Dance"" Action.</p>
<h3>Building A Useful Robot.</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We believe that we've created
something special in Mia.  Mia offers many outstanding features and
functionality at an incredibly low price compared to all of the other
robots that we've purchased, programmed and tested as we found that some robots
were useful, others were entertaining, but none of them were easy to use.
 </p>
<p>During our extensive research we quickly learned the
drawbacks of owning or building any robot and went directly to work on solving
the main problems facing the industry and keeping robots from making it to
market in a big way.  Aside from Mia being extremely customizable and easy
to operate, we knew she had to be at minimum, capable of easily learning and performing
tasks that would deem her a useful addition to any family or business.</p>
<p>To be able to design and build a low cost, fully
functional, easy to use robot for the masses we brought on some extremely
talented hardware technical experts who have over 15 years of experience in
hardware and motor system design and control to the Mia project.  We
discovered that having 10 servos and an intense controller board just for her hands
would increase costs substantially so we first worked on removing every
unnecessary motor, servo and controller board from Mia giving her gloves and a
gear driven flexible thumb instead of multiple fingers drawn by strings. This
instantly offered Mia the ability to hold heavier objects. Of course
Mia cannot play an acoustic piano, but she has no problem running a midi file
to control an entire orchestra on a digital piano.   We also focused on
how we could reuse the same strong motors and gears over and over, allowing us
to order more of the same components and reduce Mia's overall production
cost. Both of Mia’s shoulders and elbows and her hips use the same
gears and the same size motors and same type of rotors further
increasing simplicity in design and reducing costs. </p>
<p>We then went to work on Mia’s brain. We contemplated
using numerous operating systems but in order to keep licensing fees from
seeping into the cost of building and distributing a useful robot, we opted to
use MyRobotLab's fully open source robotic operating system which already
contained hundreds of plugins to help Mia achieve all the tasks we wanted her
to achieve in operating motors, controlling lights, recognizing and tracking
objects, learning her environment and autonomous conversation.  All that
was left was adding the Impervio Technologies Cognitive Scripting engine (Artificial
Intelligence software) and a remote controller application to allow users to
program custom actions for Mia to perform in their own environment. </p>
<p>Cognitive Scripting allows an easy method for a user
to teach Mia new tasks compared with most other Robots requiring to program a
robot to perform each new task. In other words you don’t have to be a software
programmer to own and teach Mia new tasks. We have designed a very simple and
easy method for you or any average person to communicate with Mia which
includes just talking to her. </p>

Meet Mia
We've spent months designing and perfecting a service robot that would be useful, strong, personable and last a long time without service and maintenance.  Mia is the culmination of years of Cognitive Scripting (Artificial Intelligence), open source software development, research and planning.  We took months studying the market, buying robots, building robots, testing, using and playing with them, even marveling at work that has been done by other companies and hobbyists alike.  We've solved many of the problems keeping robots from reaching the public on a large commercial scale including affordable pricing. 
No Programming Required!
We developed Mia to be extremely easy to use, right out of the box.  She comes completely setup and already understands hundreds of commands and recognizes thousands of objects.  There's no programming needed to help Mia learn new actions.  Mia tells you when she doesn't know how to do something and asks you to show her how.  You simply use your smartphone as a remote control to ""show"" Mia how to perform an action.  Once you create an action you save it directly on Mia's onboard Quad Core computer and tell Mia what command will run the action the next time.   That's all.  You can also upload and sell Actions in the Mia Action Store (ready in February 2015). Let's see who can make the best Mia - ""History of Dance"" Action.
Building A Useful Robot.


We believe that we've created
something special in Mia.  Mia offers many outstanding features and
functionality at an incredibly low price compared to all of the other
robots that we've purchased, programmed and tested as we found that some robots
were useful, others were entertaining, but none of them were easy to use.
 
During our extensive research we quickly learned the
drawbacks of owning or building any robot and went directly to work on solving
the main problems facing the industry and keeping robots from making it to
market in a big way.  Aside from Mia being extremely customizable and easy
to operate, we knew she had to be at minimum, capable of easily learning and performing
tasks that would deem her a useful addition to any family or business.
To be able to design and build a low cost, fully
functional, easy to use robot for the masses we brought on some extremely
talented hardware technical experts who have over 15 years of experience in
hardware and motor system design and control to the Mia project.  We
discovered that having 10 servos and an intense controller board just for her hands
would increase costs substantially so we first worked on removing every
unnecessary motor, servo and controller board from Mia giving her gloves and a
gear driven flexible thumb instead of multiple fingers drawn by strings. This
instantly offered Mia the ability to hold heavier objects. Of course

to control an entire orchestra on a digital piano.   We also focused on
how we could reuse the same strong motors and gears over and over, allowing us
to order more of the same components and reduce Mia's overall production
cost. Both of Mia’s shoulders and elbows and her hips use the same
gears and the same size motors and same type of rotors further
increasing simplicity in design and reducing costs. 
We then went to work on Mia’s brain. We contemplated
using numerous operating systems but in order to keep licensing fees from
seeping into the cost of building and distributing a useful robot, we opted to
use MyRobotLab's fully open source robotic operating system which already

<div> <h3>SUMMARY</h3> <p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>We dread queues on checkout lines at super markets and grocery stores as we often have them here in Nigeria, and we know we are not alone in this. So we hope that by these humble steps we are taking, we can turn around retail payments and checkouts and make something as common as shopping at a grocery store so easy and non-painstaking, just by applying a technology as common as QR codes.</b></span><br/></p>
<p>Our initial target market are the over 29 million Nigerians with access to a good smartphone and internet service. We think we can make a difference in their lives by saving them the time that would have been spent on checkout lines.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>PAYMENTS AND CHECKOUTS</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Nigeria is the largest country by population in Africa with
over 170 million people. E-commerce, and modern commerce generally is just
beginning to boom in our recent democratic efforts. Because of this, large
retail shops and stores are still somewhat few, and concentrated in Lagos, our
largest city in Nigeria. So a visit to the mall is always accompanied by so
much frenzy, that sometimes it isn't worth the advantages. To get just a loaf
of bread in a store at the mall could take one almost an hour because of long
queues at checkout points.</p>
<p>So if there could be a way to make retail shopping painless,
self-service, and cheap at the same time, retailers would love this. It would
increase customer satisfaction and turnover as more people would get to buy
more stuff within a short period of time. That's what our project has set out
to do. With Knitle, we can make a great impact on these millions living in our
cities and save them some time, using just a simple technology like QR codes.</p>Here's an example of a typical busy day (which is almost every day) in one of our premier retail stores in Nigeria:<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/987894/files/20141105041710-shoprite_crowd.jpg?1415189830"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Many are seasoned business men and women just trying to grab an item before getting on with their busy schedules. We can help these people save some time with this project. They would absolutely love and pay for it.</div><div>
<br/>
<h3>SCENARIOS</h3>
<div>
<p>1. 
Jess is a customer at Shoprite. So she visits Shoprite
one busy Saturday to buy just a loaf of bread. On getting to the checkout line,
she sees this long queue of customers trying to checkout. Most of these
customers have more than 5 items to pay for. She thinks to herself,
""will just an item keep me on this long queue for almost 30 minutes?""
She's not happy, so she decides to drop the bread and come back later or just
buy from the seller alongside the road. Now here's where we come in. If she
could just have scanned a QR Code pasted on the Bread wrapper to pay, and show Shoprite
staff an e-receipt from us confirming her payment, she'd be good and happy.</p>
<p>2. 
Fatima is a Shoprite customer. She visits Shoprite
one busy Saturday and buys lots of items. Noticing that the queue at the
checkout point is long, she pulls out her phone, launches our app and scans the
QR Codes of all the items she has picked from the shelves. She immediately pays
and gets an e-receipt that she can show to the Shoprite staff as proof of
payment.</p>
<p>3.<span>  </span>John
loves movies. He sees a trailer on Youtube for a movie currently showing in the
Silverbird Cinemas and loves it instantly. But he's usually weary of the fact
that tickets for hit movies are hard to buy on location at the cinema because
of the long queues. So luckily for him, a QR Code is shown at the end of the
trailer he watched to enable him ""Follow to pay"". He pulls out his
mobile phone, scans the QR Code, pays for the movie, and gets an e-receipt
immediately to show as proof of payment. On getting to the cinema, he just
walks in, shows the receipt to the staff, and takes a seat to watch his
favorite movie.</p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>THE STEPS</h3>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Pick an item off the shelf that you would like to buy and scan the qr code on the item to put it in a virtual cart. (Much like this:)<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/987947/files/20141105044650-scan_qr_item.jpg?1415191610"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
</li>
<li>Pick other items like this one as you go on with your shopping.</li>
<li>When done, visit your cart in the app and make payments.</li>
<li>You get an e-receipt confirming that you have paid for these items.</li>
<li>Proceed to bag the items you have bought at designated points in the store.</li>
<li>On your way out, present the e-receipt to the store staff so they can confirm your payment and update their records.</li>
</ol>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">And that's it. You're done. That simple. No queuing. All self-service. That's what we envision.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<b style=""line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">WHERE WE ARE</b><br/>
</div>
</div><div> <p>We are currently on a beta testing stage. We just launched the base for our payments system. It features making qr codes for various activities on the web and how that would be helpful for a ""buying"" or ""paying"" activity. We have activities like  ""Like on Facebook"", ""Follow on Twitter"", ""Watch on Youtube"" etc. currently on the site.</p>
<p>This funding would enable us to establish ourselves as a proper company, hire staff to help with other software integration issues, and ensure that we move fast enough to get ahead of competitors and other big companies trying to get it this space.</p>

</div></div>","SUMMARY We dread queues on checkout lines at super markets and grocery stores as we often have them here in Nigeria, and we know we are not alone in this. So we hope that by these humble steps we are taking, we can turn around retail payments and checkouts and make something as common as shopping at a grocery store so easy and non-painstaking, just by applying a technology as common as QR codes.
Our initial target market are the over 29 million Nigerians with access to a good smartphone and internet service. We think we can make a difference in their lives by saving them the time that would have been spent on checkout lines.

PAYMENTS AND CHECKOUTS

Nigeria is the largest country by population in Africa with
over 170 million people. E-commerce, and modern commerce generally is just
beginning to boom in our recent democratic efforts. Because of this, large
retail shops and stores are still somewhat few, and concentrated in Lagos, our
largest city in Nigeria. So a visit to the mall is always accompanied by so
much frenzy, that sometimes it isn't worth the advantages. To get just a loaf
of bread in a store at the mall could take one almost an hour because of long
queues at checkout points.
So if there could be a way to make retail shopping painless,
self-service, and cheap at the same time, retailers would love this. It would
increase customer satisfaction and turnover as more people would get to buy
more stuff within a short period of time. That's what our project has set out
to do. With Knitle, we can make a great impact on these millions living in our
cities and save them some time, using just a simple technology like QR codes.Here's an example of a typical busy day (which is almost every day) in one of our premier retail stores in Nigeria:
Many are seasoned business men and women just trying to grab an item before getting on with their busy schedules. We can help these people save some time with this project. They would absolutely love and pay for it.

SCENARIOS

1. 
Jess is a customer at Shoprite. So she visits Shoprite
one busy Saturday to buy just a loaf of bread. On getting to the checkout line,
she sees this long queue of customers trying to checkout. Most of these
customers have more than 5 items to pay for. She thinks to herself,
""will just an item keep me on this long queue for almost 30 minutes?""
She's not happy, so she decides to drop the bread and come back later or just
buy from the seller alongside the road. Now here's where we come in. If she
could just have scanned a QR Code pasted on the Bread wrapper to pay, and show Shoprite
staff an e-receipt from us confirming her payment, she'd be good and happy.
2. 
Fatima is a Shoprite customer. She visits Shoprite
one busy Saturday and buys lots of items. Noticing that the queue at the
checkout point is long, she pulls out her phone, launches our app and scans the
QR Codes of all the items she has picked from the shelves. She immediately pays
and gets an e-receipt that she can show to the Shoprite staff as proof of
payment.
3.  John
loves movies. He sees a trailer on Youtube for a movie currently showing in the
Silverbird Cinemas and loves it instantly. But he's usually weary of the fact
that tickets for hit movies are hard to buy on location at the cinema because
of the long queues. So luckily for him, a QR Code is shown at the end of the
trailer he watched to enable him ""Follow to pay"". He pulls out his
mobile phone, scans the QR Code, pays for the movie, and gets an e-receipt
immediately to show as proof of payment. On getting to the cinema, he just
walks in, shows the receipt to the staff, and takes a seat to watch his
favorite movie.


THE STEPS


Pick an item off the shelf that you would like to buy and scan the qr code on the item to put it in a virtual cart. (Much like this:)

Pick other items like this one as you go on with your shopping.
When done, visit your cart in the app and make payments.
You get an e-receipt confirming that you have paid for these items.
Proceed to bag the items you have bought at designated points in the store.
On your way out, present the e-receipt to the store staff so they can confirm your payment and update their records.

And that's it. You're done. That simple. No queuing. All self-service. That's what we envision.



WHERE WE ARE

 We are currently on a beta testing stage. We just launched the base for our payments system. It features making qr codes for various activities on the web and how that would be helpful for a ""buying"" or ""paying"" activity. We have activities like  ""Like on Facebook"", ""Follow on Twitter"", ""Watch on Youtube"" etc. currently on the site.
This funding would enable us to establish ourselves as a proper company, hire staff to help with other software integration issues, and ensure that we move fast enough to get ahead of competitors and other big companies trying to get it this space.
Sample QR code designs




Scan any of those codes to test it.

HOW YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WOULD BE USED

$10k would go into getting proper office spaces.
While we are superstars at software development (yes we are :)), we need extra help with a lot of other logistics. So another $15k would go into hiring top talent in the country, relocating them to our city, and ensuring their salary payments for at least a year.
$10k would go into launching our payments portal, its marketing, and customer acquisition.
Believe you me, that's about what we need. The remainder $15k would be kept for unforeseen challenges. We can't escape them, and they would always come because, hello, this is Nigeria.

<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>My <strong>Moto Mod™ candidate</strong> is there to tackle one major problem ; to get rid of the frustration of untangling your earphones every time you use them. We all have experienced that situation when we see a ball of wires instead of our earphones. Worst case, they might even have broken. In addition, you don't need to carry separate earphones whenever you go out.</p>
<p>For this, we have created the <strong>EarMods</strong>, the perfect companion for your Moto Z smartphone. The case has <strong>built-in earphones</strong> with retractable wires, so they always stay inside, protected. Even if you do not own a Moto Z smartphone, we have an option for you too. The mod also has a headphone jack if you want to plug in your own headphones, and a 1000 mAh battery to keep you going all day.  The mod and phone can also stand on the side  using a built-in stand.</p>
<p>The <strong>EarMods lite </strong>version has 2 headphone jacks instead of one, so you can watch a movie or listen to music with your friends. this, too has a 1000 mAh battery,  but it does not have built-in earphones. </p>
<p>For a limited number of people, we would make <strong>custom EarMod cases</strong> for their smartphone which work by the audio jack or bluetooth.</p>

A design that would fit onto virtually any bike with a 1 1/8” thread-less steering system, which is the overwhelming majority of bicycles built within the last 25 years.

That is simply not the case. Neodymium magnets are widely used within electronic devices and do not interfere with phone reception or any other phone functions. Apple iPhone and Android devices use NAND flash memory, which is immune to magnets. Designed for joy rides, to-work rides, coffee-shop rides, hard-core rides and all other rides. As easy as 1, 2.1). Use an allen key to remove stem cap bolt & cap2). Place phone mount in position. Insert bolt and tighten. FORMAt F3 Cycling, the premise of form follows function is what drives us. True to this principle, our Phone Mount's aesthetics are sleek and minimalistic. Practically becoming one with the bike. FUNCTION 1). The interface uses 4 neodymium magnets that are 100% safe for your phone. They create a strong bond, yet provide an effortless release with our patent-pending twist & lift design. Plus, the larger surface area gives stability vs. small connection of quarter turn phone mounts2). Multiple choice decision. Position A puts your phone directly over the stem in a more out front viewing position. Position B moves your phone back and offers more extreme angling adjustability. This position must also be used with steep upright stems.3). Docks your phone in portrait or landscape mode. Change positions on the fly in seconds.4). Adjustability to angle your phone to your preferred viewing position.5). Large device mounting. If you're one of those fanatics who trains inside when it's not so nice outside, mount an iPad and load your favorite training software where the conditions are perfect year round or binge watch your favorite TV show. NOTE: our mount is not designed to use large devices for outdoor riding.6). We use 3M's strongest grade adhesive (for these type of applications) to bond our ultra-thin case plate to your phone case. 4 symmetrically placed circular protrusions enable phone docking, then allowing a twist to raise motion for undocking. The purposeful ergonomic case plate design feels nice to the touch, yet is barely noticeable when not using it. NOTE: case plate application guidelines must be strictly adhered to. Packaging comes with detailed instructions and our website has a how-to video.    7). Some computer brands and other electronics come with tethers. So, we created a tether like no other.  A few revolutions takes it on or off in seconds. We recommend using it at all times, but after watching Mike bomb down railroad tracks at 17mph, it's doubtful you'll feel the need. Many riders want to use a phone and GPS. We've got you covered as our Phone Mount works beautifully in tandem with our FormMount mounting system. You can even add a GoPro or light. There is no cleaner solution to offer a bicycle more devices and less clutter. A matter of safety. Reflectors, bells or lights are one thing, but today's large smart phones can take up a lot of real estate. Space better served for things like your hands. Another safety feature of stem cap mounting is how it positions your phone in the center of your line of sight. Biking with your phone displayed has become commonplace. More and more companies (and crowdsourcing campaigns) are trying to keep up with the demand. While we want our campaign to focus on the virtues of our mount, the comparisons are worth mentioning. It won't take much online browsing time to discover these facts for yourselves.Many mounts out there today are not very user friendly in terms of how they affix to handlebars and/or lock your phone into some sort of clamping mechanism, with many of the designs using a rubberized material to hold your pricey phone in place. This makes for a clunky look, questionable phone security and it takes up precious handlebar space.That said, there are a few nice looking mounts that also that attach your phone easily.

Besides this server should be able to recognize voice commands when making a phone call or using skype in natural human communication.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">b) Design and build a simple dashboard to visualize in a friendly manner connected devices and the spoken commands.

<p>c) Design a device with persistent internet connection which can turn on and turn off other devices from house and office while using the dashboard and by calling from a common landline and skype as well.</p>

</div><h3><b>Earthquake notification</b></h3><div>
<b></b><p>We know there are a lot of devices which are very useful in your daily life, but they are not connected to internet or they don't have characteristics to use them from your smartphone.</p>
<p><b></b>We have been working in the last couple of weeks with many of the main sismological agencies to add features to Suitch to disconnect itself when it detects an incoming earthquake some seconds before they even hit your zone in order to avoid more disasters.</p>
<p>Suitch works to control your devices using voice commands and text. You can also configure the server to notify you via email, facebook, telegram and hangout messenger. Additionally Suitch can be paired together with applications such as Gmail and Evernote to use the system as a small virtual assistant.</p>
<h3>Prototypes status</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The prototypes are now ready, from the server to the Suitch devices and in order to continue with our project we will use the funds to start producing the first units commercially available. </p>

<br/><p>We are currently moving our main servers which keep the service alive into cloud servers, this allows us to offer almost full time service, nearly 99% of uptime inherited from the cloud service and obviously load balancing. When you support with your pledge we will be able to have better access to tooling, and better server providers.</p>
</div><p></p><p></p><h3>Our work schedule</h3><div>We will be producing first the electronic stuff, because we already have identified our providers and we are ready to give them the order to start producing our PCBs. We will be contacting them 3 days after we receive the money from indiegogo, this will be done this way to end up any documents or legal papers we need to provide as a result of the money transfer.</div><div>

<br/>
</div><div>We know the PCB production will last from 3 to 6 weeks depending on the amount of PCBs to produce but we will be doing other tasks in parallel.</div><div>Our electronics provider is already identified and also waiting for the order to start shipping, they will be contacted 7 days after receiving the money from indiegogo. The delivery time for these providers would be between 5 to 8 weeks after placing the order with them. Because we would try to place a medium order we might have to wait a little bit longer for them to finish electronics production. In case we see we need to alter our schedule, we will notify you with time.</div><div>Enclosure production will start 5 weeks after receiving the funds, because the needed plastics to produce them would take some time to arrive at our place. The production of the enclosures would take from 4 to 7 weeks and they will be 3D printed, one of our goals is to be able to mass produce everything in molds, we already have identified a provider for this, we will notify you if our provider lowers the price to produce using molds from them.</div><div>

<br/>
</div><div>
<p>It is clear that we not only need to fundraise but we also need some personnel to fulfill the needs of our project in its production state. We will be making some interviews and hire 2 or 3 people to help us out with quality control test, soldering, assembling, packaging and finally shipping. The packaging, handling, shipping and logistics is already analyzed and we are now closing allianses with some shipping companies to streamline the process.</p>
<p>With the teamwork we will be putting together, at the end of receiving all the pieces and electronics from our providers we will be performing quality test on every piece received from our providers with the aim of identifying or exchanging any damage on them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/586711/files/20140517231055-imagen_5.jpg?1400393455"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>The assembling of Suitch will start 10 days after ending with the production of the enclosure and of course running quality tests on them, every Suitch will be tested individually. Because every Suitch needs some love, finishing all the units might take from 2 to 4 weeks to start shipping.</p>
</div><p></p><p></p><h3>Shipping and delivering</h3><div>Our final stage will be making the site public to everyone and we will close beta tests so that everyone will be able to start using their accounts. We will send you notification on your package being sent out.</div><h3>Your support means a lot to us!</h3><div>There is no small or big support, just the action itself for us means a lot, we have worked long months to publish this project, so we want to thank you for your support and for giving us the chance to deliver this amazing product to you.</div><p></p><p></p></div>","What is Suitch?Last year my brother and I created a startup focusing on developing devices with internet capabilities and technology products for the internet of things so from then Suitch was born.

Since then we had to focus on our own project which consists of three major platforms that make it work.




a) Build a server to connect electronics for the internet of things, this server should notify via your favourite messenger (facebook messenger, hangouts messenger or telegram messenger) in an easy way. Besides this server should be able to recognize voice commands when making a phone call or using skype in natural human communication.
b) Design and build a simple dashboard to visualize in a friendly manner connected devices and the spoken commands. Using the dashboard you will be able to review in real time the status of the devices and execute actions from the dashboard directly on the connected Suitch.
c) Design a device with persistent internet connection which can turn on and turn off other devices from house and office while using the dashboard and by calling from a common landline and skype as well.


Earthquake notification
We know there are a lot of devices which are very useful in your daily life, but they are not connected to internet or they don't have characteristics to use them from your smartphone.
We have been working in the last couple of weeks with many of the main sismological agencies to add features to Suitch to disconnect itself when it detects an incoming earthquake some seconds before they even hit your zone in order to avoid more disasters.
Suitch works to control your devices using voice commands and text. You can also configure the server to notify you via email, facebook, telegram and hangout messenger. Additionally Suitch can be paired together with applications such as Gmail and Evernote to use the system as a small virtual assistant.
Prototypes status

The prototypes are now ready, from the server to the Suitch devices and in order to continue with our project we will use the funds to start producing the first units commercially available. 


We are currently moving our main servers which keep the service alive into cloud servers, this allows us to offer almost full time service, nearly 99% of uptime inherited from the cloud service and obviously load balancing. When you support with your pledge we will be able to have better access to tooling, and better server providers.
Our work scheduleWe will be producing first the electronic stuff, because we already have identified our providers and we are ready to give them the order to start producing our PCBs. We will be contacting them 3 days after we receive the money from indiegogo, this will be done this way to end up any documents or legal papers we need to provide as a result of the money transfer.


We know the PCB production will last from 3 to 6 weeks depending on the amount of PCBs to produce but we will be doing other tasks in parallel.Our electronics provider is already identified and also waiting for the order to start shipping, they will be contacted 7 days after receiving the money from indiegogo. The delivery time for these providers would be between 5 to 8 weeks after placing the order with them. Because we would try to place a medium order we might have to wait a little bit longer for them to finish electronics production. In case we see we need to alter our schedule, we will notify you with time.Enclosure production will start 5 weeks after receiving the funds, because the needed plastics to produce them would take some time to arrive at our place. The production of the enclosures would take from 4 to 7 weeks and they will be 3D printed, one of our goals is to be able to mass produce everything in molds, we already have identified a provider for this, we will notify you if our provider lowers the price to produce using molds from them.



It is clear that we not only need to fundraise but we also need some personnel to fulfill the needs of our project in its production state. We will be making some interviews and hire 2 or 3 people to help us out with quality control test, soldering, assembling, packaging and finally shipping. The packaging, handling, shipping and logistics is already analyzed and we are now closing allianses with some shipping companies to streamline the process.
With the teamwork we will be putting together, at the end of receiving all the pieces and electronics from our providers we will be performing quality test on every piece received from our providers with the aim of identifying or exchanging any damage on them.


The assembling of Suitch will start 10 days after ending with the production of the enclosure and of course running quality tests on them, every Suitch will be tested individually. Because every Suitch needs some love, finishing all the units might take from 2 to 4 weeks to start shipping.
Shipping and deliveringOur final stage will be making the site public to everyone and we will close beta tests so that everyone will be able to start using their accounts. We will send you notification on your package being sent out.Your support means a lot to us!There is no small or big support, just the action itself for us means a lot, we have worked long months to publish this project, so we want to thank you for your support and for giving us the chance to deliver this amazing product to you.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Let me introduce the Trak-Off cell phone case.  The video really explains it all, so if you haven't watched it yet, please do.  (Tami and I will wait...)</p>
<p>All done?  Good.  As I said, the Trak-Off case design is simple, but the problem it solves is complex.  Cell phones have changed the world and nearly all of us rely on them for work, family and fun.  The downside is they have collected data about us and our lives that, with a little work, is available to anyone who wants it.   When we're using our phone there isn't much that can be done about that, but why leave that data flying around when you aren't using your phone?   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/827578/files/20140901184546-Campaign_Card2.jpg?1409622346"" src="""" style=""width: 427px; height: 427px;""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Tell 'em to Trak-Off.</h3>
<p>Put yourself back in control of your data.  Once your phone is inside the case you cannot be tracked, and your data is not available to data snoops.  The Trak-Off cell phone case is a product for
the millions of cell phone users across the world who object to cell phone
tracking whether by businesses, municipalities, governments or individuals.<span>  </span></p>
<p><span>Tami and I... (I'm Art by the way. Nice to meet you.) Tami and I formed Trak-Off Designs, Inc. just a few months ago.  (No easy task in California.) Our goal is to successfully manufacture, market and sell this product.  We have had a number of wonderful business advisers to help us avoid the obvious pitfalls.  We have a plan for handling company growth from initial manufacturing to full fledged intergalactic domination.  (That's a thing, right?)</span><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">    The general idea of
the Trak-Off cell phone case is to block all communication to and from the cell
phone.  This not only prevents GPS tracking, but also blocks emails,
texts and calls just as if the phone was off.  <br/>

<p>This
is far faster than powering down the phone and can be reversed just as quickly. The Trak-Off case
is also a phone case and provides the basic protection to the phone and screen

<h3>The details<br/>
</h3> <p>Breaking it down:</p>
<p>We've been through the numbers and we need about $26,000 to get this project off the ground in a small-sized way.  We have set this amount (plus the Indiegogo cut, plus the 20% perk costs) as the minimum necessary.  If we don't reach our goal all your generous donations will be refunded. More money and we can go bigger.<br/></p> <ul>
<li>
<b>Die cut press</b>-  We aren't getting anywhere without one of these magic devices to cut massive amounts of Trak-Off cases in less time than it took me to write this sentence.  They cost from $3,000 at the low end to upwards of $100,000.  We can get by initially with the fully manual <b>$3,000</b> model.</li>
<li>
<b>Box X/Tacking  sewing machine</b>:  This is essential for being able to stitch the webbing to the case as quickly as possible.  Time is money here.  There are three box-X stitches and  two tacks on every Trak-Off case.  These are time consuming if done by hand.   Not counting delivery, programming and set-up costs this beauty runs about <b>$6,000</b>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Heat Cutter</b>- This device cuts the webbing in as perfect a way as can be done.  Totally professional.  This one's a bargain at about<b> $200</b>.</li>

<b>Trak-Off website</b>- I have designed websites before, but this needs to be... well it needs to be good and it needs to be fully functional from the first order.  Prices vary, but I'm setting aside <b>$1,000</b> for this,  We already have the <a href=""http://www.trakoff.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.trakoff.com</a> domain name.</li>
<li>
<b>Trak-Off case fabric (vinyl shell, fabric liner, webbing, etc.) - </b>Our cost estimate put his at right around $5.50 per Trak-Off phone case.  Of course all the parts and pieces come in different size packs and rolls but for our initial run of 2,000 units this comes in at <b>$11,000</b>.  We truly believe the market for this is in the millions worldwide, but we're big enough to start small.  Again if we surpass our goal we can go bigger on the initial run.<br/>
</li> <li>
<b>The little Trak-Off fabric tags</b>- These babies run almost $1 apiece believe it or not.  That's a whopping <b>$2,000</b> for our first run.</li>
<li>
<b>Slide Case Package</b> - The artwork for these has already been designed.  If you watched the video you got a good look at both sides of this.  Including set-up and shipping these run about 60 cents each in lots of 3,000.  That's <b>$1,800</b> for the first run of 2,000 units with 1,000 packages left over for the second run.</li>
<li>
<b>Perks- (That's you.)</b>  Of course we have no way of knowing what level people will support us at, but our estimates across all levels - accounting for more support at lower levels is:  <b>about 20% of the crowdfunded amount will be used to fulfill the perks</b>.  This includes product costs, set-up fees, shipping costs to us, shipping and packaging costs to you.  (I don't know about you, but I want a T-shirt and a hat already.)</li>

</div> <div> <h3>The Challenges <br/>
</h3>I am scared to death of this project.  I am scared of failing.  Strangely enough I am also scared of succeeding.  In fact I am probably more scared of succeeding than I am of failing because there so many different levels of success and all of them have their own challenges.  We have tried to come up with a scaled business plan so that we can handle the success at different levels.  We hope to start small and own this product ""from the root to the crown"" (as one of our business friends advised us), but we also have found a manufacturing partner if we cannot meet demand.  That adds cost of course, but saves time.<br/>

</strong><h3>Storage</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>If storage space is an issue then Mobile+ is all you
need. Mobile+ comes with 32GB,  64GB or 128GB internal storage; if
that's still not enough, any Mobile+ version comes with SDXC up to 256GB. We cannot make it happen without your pledge.<br/></p>

<br/>
<h3>Security</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>We take security very seriously; before you’re able
to use Mobile+, you must unlock it with your index finger. Once you do, you are prompted to enter your userid and password. A few seconds later, a
random 4 to 8-digit number is sent to your cellphone; you must enter those digits into Mobile+ to proceed with the unlocking .  You can
leave Mobile+ unattended without any fear of prying eyes or theft. Mobile+
is completely unusable if stolen. We even disable side-entry to discourage theft alltogether. Please help us make it happen.

You will be able to pair Mobile+ here in New York with your partner's phone in Paris). You can make your device the master and Mobile+ the slave, vice versa. For instance, let's say you are in London, your boss is in Barcelona, and you want to share with your boss... You know what? Let's watch instead. See how pairing with Mobile+ is nothing like ""the pairing"" you are used to.  We need your help to make it happen.<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FeaaxOTbu5DQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DeaaxOTbu5DQ&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FeaaxOTbu5DQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p>What you can do with our pairing approach is only limited by imagination. Please support our campaign; make a pledge now to help us reach our goal.<br/></p>
<b><br/></b><h2>
<b>What will your contribution do?</b>
</h2>
<p>Without your help, Mobile+ cannot happen. Every cent collected
will go towards materials, components, 3d printing, prototyping activities. Thus far, there
have been a few of those activities already, and we expect quite a few more
before completion. As you might imagine, this is not an easy task to integrate printing,
scanning and faxing into a tablet and try to keep the weight in check. Any pledge
collected is used as follows:</p>
<p><span>1)<span> 
</span></span>to pay for the expenses related to the activities
of completing Mobile+ (activities include buying raw materials, components, paying manufacturer for materials &amp; services, send schematics to the printer and repeat that process
over and over and over till completion)</p>
<p><span>2)<span> 
</span></span>to pay for legal fees to protect Mobile+ from
infringement </p>
<p><span>3)<span> 
</span></span>to pay for patent expenses</p>
<p><span>4)<span> 
</span></span>to begin manufacturing of Mobile+; beyond
expenses mentioned above, all remaining pledges will go directly to the
manufacturing of Mobile+</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Mobile+ Impact in the World<br/>
</h3> <p>Imagine for a moment what it means to have Mobile+ around; everyone will have a printer, a scanner and a fax within reach. No more looking around for a printer or a fax machine. If printing, faxing or scanning is not of interest to you, how about being able to capture activities in the dark with Mobile+ infrared technology. And if security is important to you, Mobile+ gives you peace of mind. No one can hack into Mobile+ without your index finger and your cellphone. Let us together leave a world without Mobile+ behind. We need your help to make Mobile+ happen. <br/></p>

<h3>Mobile+ Launch</h3>
<p>Not to outdo the progress the engineering is making, we have taken a number of steps to shorten
the time it would take to introduce <b>Mobile+ </b>to the market.Timeline of activities is discussed
below.</p>
<p>we have already taken the following steps, some of which are completed while others are work in progress:</p>
<p><b>May 2012: </b>InterNotes
Mobile applied for and was granted a provisional patent (EFS ID: 12900728; Application No: 61653525; Confirmation No: 9840)</p>
<p><b>May 2012: </b>InterNotes
Mobile applied for a tax ID with US Internal Revenue Service; tax ID was issued (EIN: 45-5388174)</p>
<p><b>June 2013: </b>Filing with New York (NY) Department of State for Certificate of Corporation; one (1) billion shares registered along with the
filing. NY State approved InterNotes Mobile request for Corporation status in the state of
NY (DOS ID: 4377538)</p>
<p><b>Ongoing: </b>Schematic
Update, Improvement, Change, Substitution. This is where most of the time is being spent to bring scanning, printing &amp;
faxing to <b>Mobile+ </b>by keeping weight and/or loss of performance in check</p>
<p><b>Ongoing: </b>Negotiation
with Manufacturer; we take a one-stop shopping approach to minimize delay, problems and cost. The manufacturer tasked to
complete the prototype is also responsible for manufacturing; in addition,
the manufacturer is tasked to handle procurement of raw materials and any components
necessary to build <b>Mobile+</b>.</p>
<p><b>TBD: </b>Upon
final schematic, a new provisional patent will be filed with the US patent office to reflect the final drawings as well as the look,
features and functionalities of <b>Mobile+</b></p>
<p><b>TBD: </b>Upon
final schematic, certification with FCC</p>
<p><b>Jan-Feb 2015: </b>Finalize Schematic</p>
<p><b>March 2015: </b>Working prototype; corrections, improvements, changes,etc..</p>
<p><b>April 2015: </b>Fully working Prototype</p>
<p><b>May-June 2015: </b>Working model</p>
<p><b>July-Sept 2015: </b>FULL testing of all components and functionalities</p>
<p><b>October 2015: </b>Preparation for production and other miscellaneous</p>
<p><b>Oct-Nov
2015: </b>Production
begins</p>
<p><b>Nov-Dec
2015: </b>Shipment
begins</p>
<br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest obstacle to completing this project is money. We have
both manufacturing experience assistance and the engineering knowledge to bring
Mobile+ to you. Yes, there is also the challenge of integrating all those
functionalities into such a small footprint and keeping the weight in check.
Our manufacturer is fully engaged and has been looking at every venue for
smaller and smaller footprints. Our management team has been tirelessly working
all the logistics for a successful launch. However, the major obstacle that always comes
to the conversation is money. That’s why we do need your help to take Mobile+
to the finish line. Please, make a pledge today and help us reach our goals.
Thank you.</p><br/><h3>Who Are We? </h3><p><a href=""http://www.InterNotesMobile.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InterNotes Mobile Corporation</a> is an innovation company which was founded in January 2012 with the exclusive task of bringing Mobile+ to the market.

Mobile+ Features at a Glance
Mobile+ features the latest technology available:
Bluetooth
 4.0, Wifi 802.11n, 3G/4G/LTE/WCDMA, Infrared, 39MP Video Camera, a 
display resolution that matches iPad, a mode of security that's 
UNMATCHED by anyone and of course printing, scanning and faxing 
capabilities. I forgot to mention UNMATCHED pairing system.




Video Camera



Mobile+ includes a rotating 39MP camera for really
breath taking pictures, and a 50X Zoom Video that can record videos as far as ½ mile
away from the scene. Mobile+ even includes infrared technology to facilitate taking
pictures or recording videos in the dark.

Storage


If storage space is an issue then Mobile+ is all you
need. Mobile+ comes with 32GB,  64GB or 128GB internal storage; if
that's still not enough, any Mobile+ version comes with SDXC up to 256GB. We cannot make it happen without your pledge.


Security


We take security very seriously; before you’re able
to use Mobile+, you must unlock it with your index finger. Once you do, you are prompted to enter your userid and password. A few seconds later, a
random 4 to 8-digit number is sent to your cellphone; you must enter those digits into Mobile+ to proceed with the unlocking .  You can
leave Mobile+ unattended without any fear of prying eyes or theft. Mobile+
is completely unusable if stolen. We even disable side-entry to discourage theft alltogether. Please help us make it happen.


Pairing Mobile+ with Other DevicesYou've heard of pairing before, who hasn't? But you've never paired your devices with Mobile+, have you? Silly me, there is no Mobile+ to  pair with yet. Whether it's across the room or across the ocean, you can pair any device with Mobile+ (that's not a typo; you read correctly.

See how pairing with Mobile+ is nothing like ""the pairing"" you are used to.  We need your help to make it happen.What you can do with our pairing approach is only limited by imagination. Please support our campaign; make a pledge now to help us reach our goal.

What will your contribution do?

Without your help, Mobile+ cannot happen. Every cent collected
will go towards materials, components, 3d printing, prototyping activities. Thus far, there
have been a few of those activities already, and we expect quite a few more
before completion. As you might imagine, this is not an easy task to integrate printing,
scanning and faxing into a tablet and try to keep the weight in check. Any pledge
collected is used as follows:
1) 
to pay for the expenses related to the activities
of completing Mobile+ (activities include buying raw materials, components, paying manufacturer for materials & services, send schematics to the printer and repeat that process
over and over and over till completion)
2) 
to pay for legal fees to protect Mobile+ from
infringement 
3) 
to pay for patent expenses
4) 
to begin manufacturing of Mobile+; beyond
expenses mentioned above, all remaining pledges will go directly to the
manufacturing of Mobile+

  Mobile+ Impact in the World
 Imagine for a moment what it means to have Mobile+ around; everyone will have a printer, a scanner and a fax within reach. No more looking around for a printer or a fax machine.

<h2>The Grand is a tablet that is specifically designed to meet the needs of seniors looking to get connected in a digital world.</h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>Introduction:</b></p>
<p>Human beings have a natural need for connection - connection to family, loved ones, and the world around them. For most of us, today's technology greatly improves our ability to connect and stay current. But as products like smartphones and tablets progress, the trend is to become <b>smaller</b> and more <b>complex</b>. Though this may seem natural, it means more difficulty for our grandparents, parents and aging loved ones. The unfortunate truth is that a generation is being left behind while the rest of us become more connected than ever.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What is the Grand Tablet?</b></p>
<p>The Grand is a solution which includes hardware, software and support. The Grand is a tablet that is specifically designed to meet the needs of seniors who are trying to connect to the digital world.We have designed the solution with ease of use be as the major focus.The Grand is also the world’s first tablet with remote login capability built into the tablet. This allows both our tech support and family members to eliminate frustrations.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>What makes us different?</b></p>
<p>The current trend in today’s devices is smaller and more compact designs that are blurring the lines between tablets and smartphones. The Grand is not just a tablet. The Grand is the solution developed from the ground up to meet the needs of seniors.  The user-interface is simplified. The fonts and icons are larger. The preloaded apps were selected by polling thousands of seniors on their preferences.  Our tech support is based in America and provides seniors with videos to help them learn how to use the preloaded apps like Facebook and Pill Reminder.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What you get: </b></p>
<p>The first generation of The Grand comes with a 10.1 inch screen making it extremely easy to see and use.The Grand’s operating system is Android 4.2 allowing access to thousands of Apps but also has a specialized launcher which simplifies the user experience. The Grand comes bundled with a package of Apps that are used by and developed for seniors like Pill Reminder, AARP and Facebook.</p>

With a simple movement the mechanism is charged with kinetic energy which is transmitted to the micro generators. The charging module is 5V USB that charges all the devices that support the standard USB. The intensity of electric current is up to 2200 mA and this offers a faster charge, by using the new tehnology ""Quick Charge 2.0"".For the people that are less technical, Jiffy with the 2200mA can simultaneously charge 6 smart phones with 4” screens that are navigating the internet through Wi-Fi, or 4 smart phones that are navigating the internet through 3G. Technical info about the prototype:Behind the micro generator is mounted a controller that has the function of continuously recovering the current and 5V voltage stabilization. Also an electrolytic capacitor which has the function of a micro accumulator is connected in the scheme to remove the current fluctuations produced by mechanical processes under the influence of kinetic energy.Electrical schemeWe documented our work process and wanted to share with you the important steps. Also watch the first prototype we tested.Thanks for making it all the way down here to meet team Jiffy!What we intend to do after the campaign is finished?After the Indiegogo campaign is finished we will start work on Jiffy immediately because we know that time is the biggest enemy for a start up. We know that we will encounter obstacles along the way, but we are ready to face them and if everything goes as planned we will deliver Jiffy within the timeline that we estimated. We hope that Jiffy is just the first of many devices that we work on. For us this is hopefully going to be a successful campaign that will turn into a small business and generate enough income to give us the possibility to work on bigger projects. It would be great to work on other projects that will bring solutions to problems like reusable energy, eco friendly energy, global warming etc. These are the problems that bother us and we hope that with your help we will be able to start attending to them.TIMELINEPerks",17.0,2,"12 Campaigns

<h3><strong>About our Manufacturing </strong></h3>
<p>For Coyote Case’s manufacturing and assembly, we have been grateful to receive the guidance of several supply chain experts and Fortune 500 engineers. The selected contract manufacturer has the capacity and capability to deliver on our product based on this design and engineering plans, and they have a strong track record in manufacturing similar devices (and indeed have manufactured many technical products you likely use today). We will continue to work closely with our team of experts and the manufacturer for quality control and reliability if the product is brought to market.</p>
<h3><strong>Value Priced</strong></h3>
<p>Our pricing on Indiegogo reflects our desire to get the Coyote Case to market quickly and to offer a value to our supporters who make it possible. We are grateful that you share our vision.  The costs include the advanced nature of the case elements, manufacturing, assembly, and shipping. When available in stores next year, Coyote Case will retail for approximately $120.</p>
<h3><strong>Community-minded entrepreneurs</strong></h3>
<p>As a company rooted in caring and a team that is dedicated to helping others, we plan to donate 5% of net Coyote Case profits to support non-profit organizations and causes that help, empower, and care for women in crisis and their families.</p>
<h3><strong>Please help us create this case</strong></h3>
<p>We’re so close to realizing our vision for manufacturing the completely integrated Coyote Case.

Have you ever wanted to show off a trick move and not been able to record it on your own? Maybe, like me, you just couldn't get a friend to help you or maybe you just wanted to practice on camera alone (and not embarrass yourself in front of your friends). That's the problem I had. I wanted to capture all of my best moves but because the camera couldn't follow me, it was hard to keep everything in frame. What I really needed was a personal robotic photographer, one that was small and easy to carry. That's why I developed Filmbo.</span><br/></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">So what is Filmbo? Basically, Filmbo is a  lightweight auto-tracking camera dock that works with your iPhone. I like to think of it as my own personal robot photographer. All you have to do is put your iPhone in the dock, click the app, select the desired mode and Filmbo follows you automatically. That's it! You don't have to worry about whether you're in frame or not anymore. Now, you can focus on what you're doing and Filmbo stays focused on you. Go ahead and record that trick move you've been practicing! Show it off to all of your friends! With its three auto-tracking modes Filmbo captures all the action. Most importantly though, Filmbo stays focused on you. Amaze all your friends with your “action” selfies. They'll probably ask you: “How did you record that?”</span></p>

Best of all, you don't need to wear any sensors or tracking devices to have Filmbo track your movements.</span><br/></p>

No more wasting time setting up your tripod or adjusting your camera angle. Now you can focus on what you're doing while Filmbo focuses on you.</span><br/>

( Compatible with iPhone 4S, 5,  5C,  5S, 6 & 6 PLUS  )

Are you like me and enjoy playing sports and taking selfies? Have you ever wanted to show off a trick move and not been able to record it on your own? Maybe, like me, you just couldn't get a friend to help you or maybe you just wanted to practice on camera alone (and not embarrass yourself in front of your friends). That's the problem I had. I wanted to capture all of my best moves but because the camera couldn't follow me, it was hard to keep everything in frame. What I really needed was a personal robotic photographer, one that was small and easy to carry. That's why I developed Filmbo.

Why Filmbo?  ""Action"" selfies.


So what is Filmbo? Basically, Filmbo is a  lightweight auto-tracking camera dock that works with your iPhone. I like to think of it as my own personal robot photographer. All you have to do is put your iPhone in the dock, click the app, select the desired mode and Filmbo follows you automatically. That's it! You don't have to worry about whether you're in frame or not anymore. Now, you can focus on what you're doing and Filmbo stays focused on you. Go ahead and record that trick move you've been practicing! Show it off to all of your friends! With its three auto-tracking modes Filmbo captures all the action. Most importantly though, Filmbo stays focused on you. Amaze all your friends with your “action” selfies. They'll probably ask you: “How did you record that?”


What can Filmbo do?
Robotic Video Mode: You get the best shot without worrying where to place your camera. Filmbo tracks your every move and records it automatically.





Moment Photo Mode: The best moments come and go in a flash, and there are shots that not even the fastest human photographer can capture. Fortunately, Filmbo works faster than a human ever could and can be configured to take a picture exactly when there is a big movement or a change of speed.





Robotic Time-lapse Mode: Want to take sequential photos on a series of movements but worried about going outside the frame? No problem. Filmbo can track you, place you at the center of the frame and take pictures at the time interval you desire.




Features



Multi Modes & Simple UI: Filmbo features three capture modes: Robotic Video Mode, Moment Photo Mode and Robotic Time-lapse Mode. Simply press the button for the desired mode and you're good to go.



Full 360 degree movement: The dock swivels 360 degrees and tilts vertically 20 degrees. It can be attached to any tripod with a 1/4 inch screw to further eliminate blind spots.



Easy to carry: At only 0.35 lb(160g), Filmbo can even fit in your pocket.
                 

Long battery life (it can also charge your iPhone): Filmbo can last for 8 or more hours per charge. It can be charged using a USB cable or used as a power source for your iPhone.
Easy to share: Filmbo works with iOS, which allows footage to be easily modified, filed or shared.

How it works?
                      


Filmbo features smart motion tracking technology that can keep your iPhone's camera lens centered on you at all times. You can also configure your Filmbo to do a full-length recording, take photos at specific time intervals, or take a picture whenever it detects a sudden movement. Even in a crowd,  Filmbo is able to adjust its speed and direction to match your movements, giving you the most natural image possible. Best of all, you don't need to wear any sensors or tracking devices to have Filmbo track your movements.




Filmbo uses Bluetooth 4.0. The dock can be quickly swiveled and tilted to keep track of its target. It can even trigger the cellphone shutter to take pictures or record videos. Simply install the Filmbo app on your iOS-based device, switch on the dock, position your phone and choose one of the three capture modes to begin. No more wasting time setting up your tripod or adjusting your camera angle. Now you can focus on what you're doing while Filmbo focuses on you.

About Us


We are a dynamic and creative team comprised of members with backgrounds in electrical engineering, software, and marketing. Our love for sports and our desire to capture life's best moments were what inspired us to develop Filmbo. In the first two prototypes, we used radio signals to control our devices, but they ended up being bulky and expensive, not to mention that the subject had to wear a transmitter, which completely took the fun out of the activity.
We then realized that, given the smartphone's popularity for taking selfies and videos, we thought: “Why not build something that works with smartphones?”. This idea gave birth to Filmbo, a light and intelligent robotic companion for your cellphone. 
     









Risk and Challenge

We all wish to see this fun idea being put into production, but as with any start-up that involves manufacturing hardware, reaching mass production will be one of the toughest challenges, especially when there are different factors and risks involved at different levels of  production. We will try to minimize risk in every aspect from supply, manufacturing, assembly to quality control, and we are fortunate to have a professional team and strong, committed suppliers on our side. We are ready for mass production!
Whether you sponsor our project directly or simply share what you heard about Filmbo with friends, you will be helping us achieve our  production goals. Once again, we thank you for your support, and hope that our efforts can take the mobile lifestyle to a whole new level!

A 3D printer with a laser!</b></p><p><i>Ester</i> will be an affordable desktop <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Selective Laser Sintering</a> 3D printer. With a 1,000cc build volume, sub-millimeter resolution, and no need for support material, <i>Ester</i> will provide the ability to print your imagination.</p><p><b>Designed for the Maker in all of us</b></p><p><i>Ester</i> will bring Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) to everyone. Existing SLS machines are large, extremely expensive, and difficult to use. <i>Ester</i> will be designed to fit on your workbench, and into your workflow.</p><p><b>Laser Sintering, at your desk</b></p><p>The right combination of parts, pricing, and availability has made it possible to create an affordable, powder-based, laser sintering printer that isn't the size of a large refrigerator, and doesn't cost as much as a small house. The age of the desktop 3D laser printer is finally here! Well, almost...</p><p><b>Join us</b></p><p>That’s where you come in. Backing this project will help turn the prototype into a <i>Developer Kit</i> and deliver it to your doorstep. In the process, you'll become part of a growing community exploring the limits of affordable laser sintering. Where we go next will be largely up to you.</p><p>Any extra funds, and the experience gained from making the <i>Developer Kit</i>, will go towards making the retail version of <i>Ester</i>, exploring new print materials, and then on to bigger and better printers. Oh, and bigger lasers.</p><h1><b>Why Laser Sintering?</b></h1><p>First, some background. Laser Sintering is a process that uses a laser to fuse layers of powder into a solid part. Like the FDM printers, the process starts with slicing a model into layers. After that, it gets different. The printer starts by spreading a layer of powder onto the build surface. Then it uses a laser to fuse the parts of the powder corresponding to the slice of the model. Next, a new layer of powder is spread and the process is repeated until the entire model is printed. Simple.</p><p>So, why is it so great? For one, you can print in any material that can be turned into a powder, and melted by a laser. That's actually a lot of stuff if you stop to think about it. The range of sinterable materials has barely been explored. And that leaves it up to you, dear Maker, to help us explore this new world of possibilities.</p><p>Second, Laser Sintering doesn't require supports. Yes, you read that right. No. More. Supports. Ever. The powder surrounding the part holds it in place so that you don't have to. You can print parts on top of each other, next to each other, or even one inside the other. Want to print an entire bearing race? No problem.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1012837/files/20141113163503-IMG_2246.JPG?1415925303"" src="""" style=""""/><a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53451"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53451"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53451"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gear Bearing by emmett (125 microns, polyester)</a><br/></p><p>With SLS we can move beyond static models and figurines. Now we can print actual functioning mechanical parts. Oh, and no supports.</p><h1>Doesn't this already exist?</h1><div>Yes it does. But have you seen the prices?! The existing commercial machines sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that's for the cheap ones. I can't afford that, so I decided to make something that us mere mortals can afford.</div><div><br/></div><p>The <i>Ester Developer Kit</i> is designed to use materials that are readily available and don't require expensive fabrication steps. All of the components can be bought online or made at your local workshop.</p><div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1013473/files/20141113232655-IMG_1906.JPG?1415950015"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Prototype 4, coming together at TechShop San Jose</span><br/>

Order a <i>Developer Kit</i> already. You'll be glad you did. I mentioned the lasers, right?</div><div><br/></div><div>If you're more interested in a printer that just works, then <i>Ester</i> isn't quite ready for you...yet. This campaign is all about making <i>Ester</i> ""just work"", so that you can someday order one and have it delivered to your door. Backing this project, no matter how much, or how little, will help make that happen.</div><div><br/></div><h1>Project Status</h1><p>Ester is still in active development, and is currently designed for Makers and hardcore prototypers. She's not pretty, but she's got it where it counts. Several functional prototypes have been built and are busily printing calibration cubes, companion cubes, gears, gear bearings, and anything else I can think of to throw at them.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1013370/files/20141113223925-IMG_1048.JPG?1415947165"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Prototype version 4.5</span></p><p></p><p>Currently, layer heights of around 150 microns work well, and 125 micron works reasonably well, depending on the model. The goal is to print 100 micron layers reliably enough to start the print and walk away. Mechanically, <i>Ester</i> can go well below 100 microns, but that's currently uncharted territory, and below 50 microns the size of the powder grain becomes the limiting factor. </p><a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:104615"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><p></p>

<li>
<b>Unified controller board</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">: The </span><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Ester</i><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> prototypes are using various controller boards that have been scavenged from existing FDM printers, and have had laser controllers grafted onto them. While they work well enough for development, they’re a rat’s nest of wires that shouldn’t be seen in public. Not that I have anything against rats; I’m sure their nests are very nice, but they make for lousy printer controllers. The plan is to create a new ARM-based controller board that unifies all of the electronics. The new controller board will be released as Open Source/Open Hardware.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Controller firmware</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">: Creating custom controller boards will require custom firmware. New firmware will be written from scratch to make sure we get something that works reliably and is built specifically for this kind of printer. The mechanics of SLS printers are different enough that using the existing families of FDM printer firmware is proving to be problematic.

With a 1,000cc build volume, sub-millimeter resolution, and no need for support material, Ester will provide the ability to print your imagination.Designed for the Maker in all of usEster will bring Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) to everyone. Existing SLS machines are large, extremely expensive, and difficult to use. Ester will be designed to fit on your workbench, and into your workflow.Laser Sintering, at your deskThe right combination of parts, pricing, and availability has made it possible to create an affordable, powder-based, laser sintering printer that isn't the size of a large refrigerator, and doesn't cost as much as a small house. The age of the desktop 3D laser printer is finally here! Well, almost...Join usThat’s where you come in. Backing this project will help turn the prototype into a Developer Kit and deliver it to your doorstep. In the process, you'll become part of a growing community exploring the limits of affordable laser sintering. Where we go next will be largely up to you.Any extra funds, and the experience gained from making the Developer Kit, will go towards making the retail version of Ester, exploring new print materials, and then on to bigger and better printers. Oh, and bigger lasers.Why Laser Sintering?First, some background. Laser Sintering is a process that uses a laser to fuse layers of powder into a solid part. Like the FDM printers, the process starts with slicing a model into layers. After that, it gets different. The printer starts by spreading a layer of powder onto the build surface. Then it uses a laser to fuse the parts of the powder corresponding to the slice of the model. Next, a new layer of powder is spread and the process is repeated until the entire model is printed. Simple.So, why is it so great? For one, you can print in any material that can be turned into a powder, and melted by a laser. That's actually a lot of stuff if you stop to think about it. The range of sinterable materials has barely been explored. And that leaves it up to you, dear Maker, to help us explore this new world of possibilities.Second, Laser Sintering doesn't require supports. Yes, you read that right. No. More. Supports. Ever. The powder surrounding the part holds it in place so that you don't have to. You can print parts on top of each other, next to each other, or even one inside the other. Want to print an entire bearing race? No problem.Gear Bearing by emmett (125 microns, polyester)With SLS we can move beyond static models and figurines. Now we can print actual functioning mechanical parts. Oh, and no supports.Doesn't this already exist?Yes it does. But have you seen the prices?! The existing commercial machines sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that's for the cheap ones. I can't afford that, so I decided to make something that us mere mortals can afford.The Ester Developer Kit is designed to use materials that are readily available and don't require expensive fabrication steps. All of the components can be bought online or made at your local workshop.
Prototype 4, coming together at TechShop San Jose
Why should I back this?If you're a serious Maker, if you want to help develop an Open Source SLS printer, or if you just love tinkering with 3D printers, then you already know why. Order a Developer Kit already. You'll be glad you did. I mentioned the lasers, right?If you're more interested in a printer that just works, then Ester isn't quite ready for you...yet. This campaign is all about making Ester ""just work"", so that you can someday order one and have it delivered to your door. Backing this project, no matter how much, or how little, will help make that happen.Project StatusEster is still in active development, and is currently designed for Makers and hardcore prototypers. She's not pretty, but she's got it where it counts. Several functional prototypes have been built and are busily printing calibration cubes, companion cubes, gears, gear bearings, and anything else I can think of to throw at them.Prototype version 4.5Currently, layer heights of around 150 microns work well, and 125 micron works reasonably well, depending on the model. The goal is to print 100 micron layers reliably enough to start the print and walk away. Mechanically, Ester can go well below 100 microns, but that's currently uncharted territory, and below 50 microns the size of the powder grain becomes the limiting factor. 
 Gearing up (150 microns, polyester)The prototype hardware needs a few more tweaks, but is otherwise working very well. It still needs to be productized, and a lot of software needs to be written, but it's actually useable the way it is. R/C Servo model (125 micron, polyester)Print MaterialEster will ship configured for sintering polyester powder, but there are plenty of other materials to try. It's just a matter of finding the right parameters for each material. Once you have your very own Ester you'll be able to experiment with sintering anything you can imagine. Chocolate, anyone?Currently polyester powder can be printed at high resolution, but low strength. Nylon can be printed at high strength but low resolution. This will very likely change as development continues. As more people try more materials we'll learn what parameters work for each material. As more people buy SLS printers, we'll be able to convince the nylon suppliers to offer finer grained powder at more reasonable prices. It's all up to you!Needs more resolution (600 micron, nylon 618s)What’s left to do?Ester has come a long ways in the last few months, but there’s still much to do before she’s ready to ship.

Unified controller board: The Ester prototypes are using various controller boards that have been scavenged from existing FDM printers, and have had laser controllers grafted onto them. While they work well enough for development, they’re a rat’s nest of wires that shouldn’t be seen in public. Not that I have anything against rats; I’m sure their nests are very nice, but they make for lousy printer controllers. The plan is to create a new ARM-based controller board that unifies all of the electronics. The new controller board will be released as Open Source/Open Hardware.


Controller firmware: Creating custom controller boards will require custom firmware. New firmware will be written from scratch to make sure we get something that works reliably and is built specifically for this kind of printer. The mechanics of SLS printers are different enough that using the existing families of FDM printer firmware is proving to be problematic. All of the firmware will be Open Source and released under a BSD license.

Desktop software: Existing desktop printing software tends to be either proprietary, and therefore tied to a specific printer, or difficult to use. Ester is a new kind of printer, and will require custom interface software. The desktop software will be completely Open Source, and my hope is that it will some day be able to interface with all consumer-grade 3D printers (FDM, SLS, and whatever comes next). Writing multi-platform desktop software is a huge task and may take significantly longer than finishing the hardware. This is the highest risk item on the list. The primary development platform will be Mac OS X, and the OS X version will be available first.


Hardware design: The prototypes are, shall we say, not easy to look at. Although they've served admirably during development, it's time for a new look. The Development Kits will keep the same Maker-friendly design, but will be fully enclosed with internally-housed electronics. As always, the final design will be just as Open Source as the rest of the project.

 Oh, the horror!Target SpecificationsThe Ester prototypes have a 100mm build cube and are using 1W lasers, but otherwise meet the target specifications. Upgrading the laser is a matter of finding a reliable supplier, and the larger build volume just needs to be tested. Easy as pie, right?

By using 4-pins only, the sensorNotes can interface just about any type of sensors you want. Ranging from simple temperature resistive sensors, to digital barometer and humidity sensors, and up to devices that require more power for operation besides interface such as is an Arduino board.</p>
<p>So let's turn our mobiles into a laboratory, make use of its power and processing capabilities.</p>
<h2>Our First Application</h2>
<p>Our first application is highly accurate thermometer operating at high precision of 0.2 F. It can display and store your daily morning measurements. As an example you can easily find out the health state of your thyroid gland, and women may predict their ovulation cycles.</p>

<ul>
<li>High Precision 0.2 F, Temperature Probe, made of Stainless steel</li>
<li>Low Cost and High Precision Mobile Instrument,</li>
<li>Differential analog inputs and an analog output, and general purpose digital I/O,</li>
<li>Can power and communicate with different kinds of sensors, from simple resistive, to advanced digital communication.</li>
</ul><h2>Brief History</h2>
<p>Our development started several years ago with the first wireless sensor network platform named VSN (Versatile Sensor Network - Platform). It was a general purpose platform featuring energy harvesting, support for multiple radios, and a general purpose analogue and digital sensor interface, made of 6-pins. At the same time we began working on a compact sensor language for simple representation of sensor data and its configuration. We wanted to make the VSN smaller, more modular and ready for professional use.</p>
<h2>SensorNotes Platform</h2>
<p>So cutting down the VSN into smaller and more flexible pieces resulted in the SensorNotes Platform (SNP), which allows you to combine various boards of size 1.5 x 1.0 inch into a final solution. Boards are stacked by using side edge 16-bit connectors. The first two products built on the SNP are shown below:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt=""SensorNotes Platform, Example Boards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.sensornotes.com/SNP-MobileLab/SNPlatform.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><em>SNP INSAmp and USB Sensor Adapter</em></p>
<p>The first (top in blue) is an ultra low input bias current, programmable gain with AC filter amplifier, for use in applications such as ECG, EMG, and measuring other very high impedance sources. The second (in red) is an USB Sensor Adapter built around the Cypress PSoC 1 with an additional precision reference, power supply, and general purpose sensor interface.</p>
<p>Using the USB Sensor Adapter and a precision probe made for our first application (highly accurate thermometer) we have developed the Android application, for which the screen shots are shown below:</p>

<p>Post as seen on a Facebook wall.</p>
<p>And the last thing was to redefine the sensor interface, from the earlier VSN board which had a 6-pin connector to interface any type of sensor to 4 pins only. By doing this we are now able to use standard jack plugs, which are small, may be water-proof, and are easy to plug-in and out. The 4-pin interface preserves all of the features found in VSN which are differential analog inputs, analog output, providing multiple digital interfaces (UART, I2C, 1-Wire, GPIO) and at the same time it can power the sensor plugged in at selectable voltage level (5.0 V or 3.3 V).</p>
<p>Since there might be numerous and varied sensors plugged into the device, there is a need for simple sensor language that allows direct mapping between sensor level/raw registers and user display.</p>
<p><img alt=""SNP Language"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.sensornotes.com/SNP-MobileLab/Language.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the past years we have specified and deployed the so-called SensorNotes compact message layer. By using it, one can simply make one's own sensor, plug it into the USB Adapter and get the results immediately on the Android display, or may even configure the sensor. One can further make use of this data and integrate it with other applications using the Open API.</p>

CRUX - Techtile Pouch
 
USB thumbdrive acts as a vital mid-term data storage solution. It is an intermediate medium for the transfer of information that is pivotal in allowing numerous communications, sharing as well as electronic processes to take place smoothly. Therefore, it is not uncommon to spot users who own several USB thumbdrives that cater towards their individual works and habits.
By merging the charm of fabric with simple technology, we aim to offer executives and students a personal lifestyle pouch that integrates their multiple USB thumbdrives, offering quick access to all the content in a single bundle.
 
How Does CRUX Work

After plugging in your USB thumbdrives into CRUX, access to all your storage content is reduced to a simple step of sliding the attached USB cable into your computer. 
  A simple button buckle makes it easy for you to secure and retrieve your thumbdrive when any adjustment is required.

CRUX can fit any thumbdrive that up to 6cm long. Most popular brands currently stock thumbdrives design that are no longer than 5cm.
What are the shipping charges?
Local shipping in Singapore will be free. For international shipping, kindly add an additional $10.
How do I indicate my choice of color and choice of words for the personalization of CRUX?We will be emailing all our contributors nearing the end of our campaign to verify the details. So do watch out for our updates!",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

""I don’t know about you, but I wondered if gesture-recognition is going to be as big the touchscreen. Ever since the film Minority Report and the rise of the Kinect, I have wondering how long it would take before it was everywhere.

Seriously, I don’t why we are still using a mouse or other controller when we can just wave a hand and manipulate controls using the Force. Fortunately, there is the 3Dpad from Ootsidebox....

<br/>...Not to spoil the video or anything, but I really see an interesting 3DPad world. Why not have something that you can use gesture recognition on, from the smartphone, to the tablet, to the PC, to the TV! In short, let’s just put a 3Dpad on everything.

<h4>Detection principle:</h4>
<p>To detect the proximity of the human hand or finger, we
are using the<span>  <b>projected capacitive
technique</b>. This is the principle of virtually all modern touch screens - except that
now we are in the air, relatively far away from the detector surface (10 cm max).</span></p><p><span>
</span></p><p><b>It’s very simple:</b> We build capacitors which are as “open” as possible,
using electrodes drawn on the electrode plane PCB in order to obtain a maximum
“hand effect”.</p>

</p><p></p>
<p></p><p><b>The capacitors formed by the electrodes
are part of an oscillator</b> whose  frequency is influenced by the distance of a
hand. When it enters the electrostatic field, this “intruder” is going to cut
the field lines and divert the electrical charges.<br/><b>Result:</b><span>  the closer the
hand approaches the electrodes, the more the oscillator’s frequency increases.</span></p><p>

Open Electronics talks 3D-Pad: "" A very interesting project for a touchless gesture control device: definitely worth supporting! "" 


""I don’t know about you, but I wondered if gesture-recognition is going to be as big the touchscreen. Ever since the film Minority Report and the rise of the Kinect, I have wondering how long it would take before it was everywhere.

Seriously, I don’t why we are still using a mouse or other controller when we can just wave a hand and manipulate controls using the Force. Fortunately, there is the 3Dpad from Ootsidebox....

...Not to spoil the video or anything, but I really see an interesting 3DPad world. Why not have something that you can use gesture recognition on, from the smartphone, to the tablet, to the PC, to the TV! In short, let’s just put a 3Dpad on everything. ""  The Geek Church Blog.  Atmel  talks 3D-Pad:"" Ootsidebox goes touchless with the 3Dpad    ""ootsideboxがIndiegogoで非接触ジェスチャーインターフェース「3Dpad」の資金募集を開始した。Arduinoシールドとして動作し、オープンソース、価格は59ユーロから。MATRIXSYNTH: Elektor 3D pad: Touchless Gesture Control Interface Now on Indiegogo3D-PAD: CONTROL POR GESTOS CON ARDUINOhttp://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNzE3OTAyMzA0.html

Our vision: ""Touchless and gesture control everywhere and for everyone!""

But not provided by a big company like Microsoft, Samsung, Apple or similar.Easily make your own with 3D-Pad!








What
is 3D-Pad, and how does it work?

3D-Pad is a touchless gesture control interface providing 3D
coordinates and gesture recognition, with a 10cm depth perception.



It consists of a sandwich made up of: 

a PCB called an electrode plane (1)

an  Arduino Shield (2)
an Arduino Uno
(3) - based on ATMEL ATmega328











Detection principle:
To detect the proximity of the human hand or finger, we
are using the  projected capacitive
technique. This is the principle of virtually all modern touch screens - except that
now we are in the air, relatively far away from the detector surface (10 cm max).
It’s very simple: We build capacitors which are as “open” as possible,
using electrodes drawn on the electrode plane PCB in order to obtain a maximum
“hand effect”.










The capacitors formed by the electrodes
are part of an oscillator whose  frequency is influenced by the distance of a
hand. When it enters the electrostatic field, this “intruder” is going to cut
the field lines and divert the electrical charges.Result:  the closer the
hand approaches the electrodes, the more the oscillator’s frequency increases.









The following signal processing is used:
a phase/frequency comparator

a control and locking program












This simple system makes the conversion of the very
small frequency
shift into a variation in a voltage signal which is easy to use:









The embedded software (sketch) running on the Arduino UNO will exploit the analog result in order to:


Calculate 3D
coordinates
Recognize basic
gestures (swipes, push and rotations)
Send it all to a
host device on the USB COM port

The evaluation software (PC) will enable you
to quickly evaluate the 3D-Pad. You'll see all the values sent by the Arduino Uno (1), the gesture
events (2) and the 3D coordinates in the form of a cursor (3).










We designed the first prototypes with our partner Elektor Labs








Check out the full description in the May edition of Elektor Magazine

3Dpad prototype's schematics (version Elektor magazine) You can download the pdf here: http://goo.gl/hqILDr
 What’s it used for?3Dpad can be used in a very wide field of applications, for instance: medical & healthcare (should reduce the nosocomial risk), household  appliance control (think at cooking when your hands are covered of fat content), gaming with ""air control"", and many other. But at the moment our favorite app is music, using 3Dpad as an ""3D Air control"" MIDI controller. Watch our first experiment in the video below:

 The ootsidebox's box





A unique opportunity to get one of the only two very early stage prototypes of 7 inches touchless screen, hand made by the inventor, Jean Noël himself!



You can see it in action in those videos: http://youtu.be/V67WuFBAX4Ahttp://youtu.be/yyR7JzCk8gs









This prototype has already traveled in a lot of famous places in Europe and USA, for instance the Noisebridge hackerspace in San Francisco, the Elektor Labs in the Netherlands, and recently at the Paris MakerFaire.

Think about it: what would have happened if you had acquired Apple's first prototype?




Here is what you've got inside the box:* a 7 inches HDMI screen equiped with ootsidebox's touchless sensor* a ""Panda board"" from TI, running demo software under Linux* the alimentation providing all required voltages






You just plug it in, and the magical demo gets started...

The image quality was lousy but it proved that the idea would work. But as Thomas A. Edison put it ""Innovation is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration."" After <b>more than one year of development </b>universe2go has now reached a<b> great level of image quality, reliability and user friendliness</b>. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMQb92xPnZIc&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>First of all the hardware (optics) needed to be optimized to be <b>lightweight, yield a sharp image and get the maximum field of view</b> in order to make even the big constellations to fit in real size.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/326135/files/20140123141859-Stargazer_I_3dmodel.jpg?1390515539"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>Secondly we developed <b>special algorithms</b> to accord for the inherent measurement errors of the smartphone, especially the compass. Although the sensors in the devices have a <b>high precision</b> (e.g. they yield very exact measurement) the compass has a very <b>low accuracy</b> which is usually not better than +/- 15 degrees. We even put the smartphones on a computerized telescope mount and spun them around to make measurements. In <b>endless testing sessions outside on the ""real night sky""</b> I finally <b>figured out how to reliably identify the correct stars and to align the overlay image with the real sky</b>. </p><p>We experimented also with <b>external sensors</b> but beside the cost effect, we really wanted to stick to the idea of a ""passive"" device. You know - Murphy's Law; with additional sensors you would always deal with empty batteries, connection problems, incompatibility and so on. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>universe2go works as long as your smartphone works!</b></span></p><p>And last but not least we experimented a lot with <b>different user interaction types</b> to make the app<b> very easy to use and control</b> when it is inside the Stargazer device. Most of the time universe2go will work ""automatically"" - just look at a ""Point of Interest"", a star, a planet or a deep sky object and it will <b>start explaining or telling an interesting story</b>. Only when you want to switch between modes or change settings you control the app with movements of your head (which is very easy to learn, as many test persons have proven already). </p><p></p><h3>Where do we stand now?</h3><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/326129/files/20140123141816-Produktfoto2.jpg?1390515496"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>We are now ready for production of the universe2go. We already designed and planned the production with <b>industrial standard 3D data formats</b>. universe2go will be <b>Made in Germany</b> in order to guarantee a <b>high quality</b> of the product.</p><p></p><ul><li>The raised funding will be mainly used for creating the tooling for the injection molding but also for optimizing the Android and IOS apps and for mixing and sound processing of the audio.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Why should you fund this?</h3><p>First of all you should fund universe2go because you think it is <b>a very cool idea</b>. Many people which have seen the prototype so far think that, too. Here are some testimonials:</p><p>""<b>Great idea! Especially the 3D images</b>"" - Thomas Jacob</p><p>""<b>Brilliant. Super idea. I believe this has a big future!</b>"" - Daniel Bockshecker</p><p>""<b>I didn't know that stargazing could be that much fun!</b>"" - Marion Hofmann</p><p>Since we have filed several patents, we are experienced in implementing new technologies together with our industry partners. In the past we sold most of our ideas and lost control over them which hurts sometimes. With universe2go we wanted to enter a new road and a new experience because we believe in sharing ideas and in the community of people who want to see interesting projects growing and developing into a great product. </p><p>For us universe2go is important not only for the business part of it but because</p><ul>
<li>we want to <b>share our enthusiasm for the night sky</b>. Ralph Waldo Emerson said it perfectly: ""Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile."" - Love this! </li>
<li>universe2go makes you <b>go outside and realize this beauty</b> instead of using your iPad or smartphone inside as a cool gadget which shows virtual stars on your living room wall. </li>
<li>it is a <b>great educational device</b> which let's you and your kids learn with great fun.</li>
<li>we need your support to make universe2go happen! The costs for the tooling is the most critical hurdle to take for any hardware project and a great risk for the entrepreneur if he does not know if anyone is really interested in his idea.</li>
<li>we want to establish an internet platform and <b>a community where you can share astro images and stories of your own about the night sky</b>. And Indiegogo is a great way to start such a community. Be the first one to join!</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3>The road ahead</h3><p></p><p>The next step is to make the injection molding tooling which takes about 6-8 weeks. When the tooling is complete, we will begin test production runs. If everything works fine we should be able to move to full production by Summer. The production timeline looks like this:</p><p></p><ul><li>
<b>March: </b>In conjunction with professional German mechanical engineers and designers with experience in mass market consumer products manufacturing we will finalize the tooling design. The pre-production prototype has been tested in the field and we are satisfied with the usability and look of the design. </li></ul><ul><li>
<b>April: </b>Injection molding tooling should be complete. Our manufacturer has done work of similar or more challenging designs for many clients in Europe. We have reviewed the tooling milestone based on the finalized 3D industrial data formats together with professional manufacturing experts. </li></ul><ul><li>
<b>May: </b>Final checks of engineering prototypes.  </li></ul><ul><li>
<b>June/July:</b> Production begins. Our manufacturer has a large facility capable of producing 10,000 units per week, if necessary, and a demonstrated track record of high quality production for major consumer brands. </li></ul><ul><li>
<b>end of July: </b>Product transferred from factory, labeled, and shipped to backers' doors!</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3>Stretch goals</h3><p>More money - more fun! We have some more ideas to enhance the universe2go experience even more. Here is the first stretch goal: </p><p></p><ul><li>$60.000 - if we reach this funding goal, universe2go will get telescope connection functionality. (You will need a separately sold wireless device to interface with your telescope) </li></ul><p>More details about the goal and the next stretch goal will be given when each of the stretch goals are reached. There a some exciting options down the line!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Spread the word</h3><p></p>Even if you do not want to fund universe2go yourself, maybe because you are not so much into night sky and astronomy, you can support us!<br/><ul>
<li>Tell friends about this campaign and the idea. <b>Share it on Facebook, Twitter or Google+</b> or any other social media platform. </li>
<li>All I want is, to make universe2go come to live and share my enthusiasm about the night sky with others.</li>

<li>What do I need to use <b>universe2go</b>? - you need a Stargazer device and a compatible smartphone (iPhone4, 4S, 5, 5S, 5C, iPod touch 4th Gen., Samsung Galaxy S3,S4,S4 active,S4 mini, Google Nexus, Sony Xperia, HTC One, LG G2). You need to download the <b>free</b> app universe2go from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store .</li>
<li>My smartphone is <b>not on the list</b>. Can't I use universe2go anyway? - MAYBE, if it is smartphone running Android, you probably can. Check the specs of your smartphone. It needs a gyro sensor, a gravitational sensor and a compass. (GPS is supported but is not mandatory, you can specify your location manually in the settings). The size and resolution of the display does not matter. (For very small displays the 3D view might not be available.). (refer to your manual or load AndroSensor from the Google Play Store to check the available sensors of your device).</li>
<li>In which <b>languages</b> is the audio? So far you can listen to universe2go in <b>English</b> and <b>German</b>. (Let's see - hopefully Spanish and French will follow soon...)</li>
<li>Can I use <b>earphones</b>? - NO, not yet. That is because every smartphone has the earphone plug at a different position so the Stargazer device would need many holes for all device types (you can drill one on your own if you dare...). I am checking the possibility of having a small adapter plug that would fit into the case. Anyway you can use a Bluetooth headset if your smartphone supports it (which it does, probably).</li>
<li>Do I need an <b>internet connection</b>? - NO, all content is stored on the smartphone. You will need an internet connection only for content updates (planned to give you fresh information about new events)</li>
<li>Can I use<b> universe2go without the Stargazer device</b>? YES - you can. You can switch to a sky map mode in the settings. The sky map mode has the basic functions but no audio. </li>
<li>Will universe2go be <b>open source</b>? - NO, not by now. The technology of the universe2go is currently registered and protected by patent law. But we are thinking about releasing a lightweight do-it-yourself cardboard kit that you could assemble together with your kids after we have successfully entered into the market.</li>
<li>Can I use universe2go with my <b>glasses</b> on? - YES, we designed the Stargazer device flat on the viewer's side to make it convenient for use with glasses on.</li>
<li>What is the difference between universe2go and a planetarium app? - JOY OF USE! A planetarium app is an intelligent sky map, but still it is a map. With universe2go you immerse into the real sky with augmented reality. And then, there is this awesome 3D effect... </li>

Great! – Take the challenge and try to search & find constellations, stars, planets or deep sky objects in the sky. universe2go will set the task and will give you feedback if you are wrong or right  .universe2go is for everyone!Have you ever looked at the night sky and wandered which stars belongs to wich constellation?Have your kids ever asked you about the stars and the night sky and all you knew was the big dipper?Did you ever wanted to find the polar star and learn about what makes him so special?Do you love to listen to fascinating stories about heroes, beasts and princesses of old?Have you ever asked yourself how far you can see with your naked eye?Do you want to know where all this beautiful Hubble images are located in the sky and learn more about their background?Do you want to know if a meteor shower is coming tonight?Did you ever wanted to find a comet that you heard or read about?You know absolutely nothing about astronomy yet? (Or even if you do but love to learn something new...)Then universe2go is definitely for you!!!Will it work with any smartphone?To claim that it will work with any smartphone would be incorrect - for any app.Anyway universe2go works with many of the currently available smartphones on the market. (Windows phones excluded, could be a stretch goal).The app will be available on the Apple App Store for IOS and on the Google Play Store for Android devices. You can choose from a list of compatible smartphones or put in the dimensions (size of display, number of pixels) in the settings.universe2go will come with a hardware adapter for your smartphone so that it will securely fit into it. This adapter is made of a smooth material to protect the smartphone from scratches. If you change your smartphone some day you can buy just another adapter to keep using universe2go.The evolution of universe2goThe first prototype was glued together with cardboard and some optics ""at hand"" nearly two years ago. The image quality was lousy but it proved that the idea would work. But as Thomas A. Edison put it ""Innovation is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration."" After more than one year of development universe2go has now reached a great level of image quality, reliability and user friendliness. First of all the hardware (optics) needed to be optimized to be lightweight, yield a sharp image and get the maximum field of view in order to make even the big constellations to fit in real size.Secondly we developed special algorithms to accord for the inherent measurement errors of the smartphone, especially the compass. Although the sensors in the devices have a high precision (e.g. they yield very exact measurement) the compass has a very low accuracy which is usually not better than +/- 15 degrees. We even put the smartphones on a computerized telescope mount and spun them around to make measurements. In endless testing sessions outside on the ""real night sky"" I finally figured out how to reliably identify the correct stars and to align the overlay image with the real sky. We experimented also with external sensors but beside the cost effect, we really wanted to stick to the idea of a ""passive"" device. You know - Murphy's Law; with additional sensors you would always deal with empty batteries, connection problems, incompatibility and so on. universe2go works as long as your smartphone works!And last but not least we experimented a lot with different user interaction types to make the app very easy to use and control when it is inside the Stargazer device. Most of the time universe2go will work ""automatically"" - just look at a ""Point of Interest"", a star, a planet or a deep sky object and it will start explaining or telling an interesting story. Only when you want to switch between modes or change settings you control the app with movements of your head (which is very easy to learn, as many test persons have proven already). Where do we stand now?We are now ready for production of the universe2go. We already designed and planned the production with industrial standard 3D data formats. universe2go will be Made in Germany in order to guarantee a high quality of the product.The raised funding will be mainly used for creating the tooling for the injection molding but also for optimizing the Android and IOS apps and for mixing and sound processing of the audio.Why should you fund this?First of all you should fund universe2go because you think it is a very cool idea. Many people which have seen the prototype so far think that, too. Here are some testimonials:""Great idea! Especially the 3D images"" - Thomas Jacob""Brilliant. Super idea. I believe this has a big future!"" - Daniel Bockshecker""I didn't know that stargazing could be that much fun!"" - Marion HofmannSince we have filed several patents, we are experienced in implementing new technologies together with our industry partners. In the past we sold most of our ideas and lost control over them which hurts sometimes. With universe2go we wanted to enter a new road and a new experience because we believe in sharing ideas and in the community of people who want to see interesting projects growing and developing into a great product. For us universe2go is important not only for the business part of it but because
we want to share our enthusiasm for the night sky. Ralph Waldo Emerson said it perfectly: ""Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile."" - Love this! 
universe2go makes you go outside and realize this beauty instead of using your iPad or smartphone inside as a cool gadget which shows virtual stars on your living room wall. 
it is a great educational device which let's you and your kids learn with great fun.
we need your support to make universe2go happen! The costs for the tooling is the most critical hurdle to take for any hardware project and a great risk for the entrepreneur if he does not know if anyone is really interested in his idea.
we want to establish an internet platform and a community where you can share astro images and stories of your own about the night sky. And Indiegogo is a great way to start such a community. Be the first one to join!
The road aheadThe next step is to make the injection molding tooling which takes about 6-8 weeks. When the tooling is complete, we will begin test production runs. If everything works fine we should be able to move to full production by Summer. The production timeline looks like this:
March: In conjunction with professional German mechanical engineers and designers with experience in mass market consumer products manufacturing we will finalize the tooling design. The pre-production prototype has been tested in the field and we are satisfied with the usability and look of the design. 
April: Injection molding tooling should be complete. Our manufacturer has done work of similar or more challenging designs for many clients in Europe. We have reviewed the tooling milestone based on the finalized 3D industrial data formats together with professional manufacturing experts. 
May: Final checks of engineering prototypes.  
June/July: Production begins. Our manufacturer has a large facility capable of producing 10,000 units per week, if necessary, and a demonstrated track record of high quality production for major consumer brands. 
end of July: Product transferred from factory, labeled, and shipped to backers' doors!Stretch goalsMore money - more fun! We have some more ideas to enhance the universe2go experience even more. Here is the first stretch goal: $60.000 - if we reach this funding goal, universe2go will get telescope connection functionality. (You will need a separately sold wireless device to interface with your telescope) More details about the goal and the next stretch goal will be given when each of the stretch goals are reached. There a some exciting options down the line!Spread the wordEven if you do not want to fund universe2go yourself, maybe because you are not so much into night sky and astronomy, you can support us!
Tell friends about this campaign and the idea. Share it on Facebook, Twitter or Google+ or any other social media platform. 
All I want is, to make universe2go come to live and share my enthusiasm about the night sky with others.
Thank you!Thank you! Yes, you! For all you out there who helped me coming this far with my idea. For all the encouragement and motivation and criticism and advice. My very special thanks go to: Marion Hofmann, Michael Hoock, Sebastian Madgwick, J-P Metsavainio, Paul Schlyter and Isidro Villo.And thank you to all the new supporters of universe2go. Let's create a new way of sharing our love for the stars!FAQ
What do I need to use universe2go? - you need a Stargazer device and a compatible smartphone (iPhone4, 4S, 5, 5S, 5C, iPod touch 4th Gen., Samsung Galaxy S3,S4,S4 active,S4 mini, Google Nexus, Sony Xperia, HTC One, LG G2). You need to download the free app universe2go from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store .
My smartphone is not on the list. Can't I use universe2go anyway? - MAYBE, if it is smartphone running Android, you probably can. Check the specs of your smartphone. It needs a gyro sensor, a gravitational sensor and a compass. (GPS is supported but is not mandatory, you can specify your location manually in the settings). The size and resolution of the display does not matter. (For very small displays the 3D view might not be available.). (refer to your manual or load AndroSensor from the Google Play Store to check the available sensors of your device).
In which languages is the audio? So far you can listen to universe2go in English and German. (Let's see - hopefully Spanish and French will follow soon...)
Can I use earphones? - NO, not yet. That is because every smartphone has the earphone plug at a different position so the Stargazer device would need many holes for all device types (you can drill one on your own if you dare...). I am checking the possibility of having a small adapter plug that would fit into the case. Anyway you can use a Bluetooth headset if your smartphone supports it (which it does, probably).
Do I need an internet connection? - NO, all content is stored on the smartphone. You will need an internet connection only for content updates (planned to give you fresh information about new events)
Can I use universe2go without the Stargazer device? YES - you can. You can switch to a sky map mode in the settings. The sky map mode has the basic functions but no audio. 
Will universe2go be open source? - NO, not by now. The technology of the universe2go is currently registered and protected by patent law. But we are thinking about releasing a lightweight do-it-yourself cardboard kit that you could assemble together with your kids after we have successfully entered into the market.
Can I use universe2go with my glasses on? - YES, we designed the Stargazer device flat on the viewer's side to make it convenient for use with glasses on.
What is the difference between universe2go and a planetarium app? - JOY OF USE! A planetarium app is an intelligent sky map, but still it is a map. With universe2go you immerse into the real sky with augmented reality. And then, there is this awesome 3D effect...

<h2>What is the Root 101?</h2>
<p>The Root 101 is the most open source and affordable tablet available today.  It comes with a completely stock version of Android Jelly Bean 4.2 (the most current version) with no bloatware apps, no ugly skinned version of Android, and comes with root access so you can install any app and even custom ROMs.  We've spent months perfecting the software to get the most out of the hardware.  As of now we've already ported two of the most popular aftermarket ROMs to the Root 101...CyanogenMod and Paranoid Android. These ROMs give Android a unique look and feel and give you more customization options than the stock OS.</p>
<p>We're dedicated to making this the most open source tablet available.  All our source code will be available online making it much easier for developers to build custom ROMs.  As people develop new ROMs we'll host them on our website for others to use.</p>
<p>When Google releases new versions of Android we'll keep updating our software so that you're always using the latest and greatest.  There's nothing worse than buying a new device only to find that a new version of Android is available a few months later and you're stuck with the old version.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Did We Choose Indiegogo?</h2>
<p>We're a new consumer electronics start-up and it's hard to get into this business.  Manufacturing great products takes a substantial initial investment.  In order to sell devices for an affordable price a large number of units need to be made.  Indiegogo gives us the opportunity to bring our product to tech enthusiasts just like us.  We've all backed other products on this site and are huge fans of crowdsourcing.  It gives people like us, who are passionate about what they do, the chance to create things never possible before.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We've Done So Far?</h2>
<p>We're a small team of 3 people (Tomi, Justin and Fredrik) with many years experience in Android development and device manufacturing.  We've spent the last six months preparing ourselves for this Indiegogo launch.  </p>
<p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>
<p>Everyone on our team has been tablet enthusiasts since before the original iPad was announced.  It's impossible to count how many tablets we've owned over the past few years.  The last few months were spent testing just about every hardware configuration you can imagine.  We knew we wanted to keep the price low, have long battery life and enough power to run apps and watch HD videos.  After all the testing we finally ended up with the combination of components that we felt gave us the best results.  Once this was done we began working with many hardware partners in China to figure out the best plan for manufacturing.  After successful prototypes were built and tested, the design and bill-of-materials were finalized.  The factory has the components ready to go and is now waiting for the go ahead from us to begin manufacturing.  We've estimated about 4 weeks from Indiegogo funding to delivery to our HQ in the US.  Once that happens then its about 2 weeks until it's delivered to your door.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/865077/pictures/original/20130611191332-parts.png?1371003211"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<p>Much of the focus of tablets is on the hardware, but in reality the software is just as important.  Having spent much time on Android tablets we knew we wanted to give our customers options.  And we knew that a stock version of the OS had to be one of those options.  Our amazing software developer has been hard at work optimizing Android for the Root 101.  A good, clean Android build does wonders for both performance and battery life.  He's also completed ports of CyanogenMod and Paranoid Android, so as of right now we have 3 builds of Android running on our prototype devices.  There's still a small amount of fine tuning to be done in the code, but that will be finished well ahead of manufacturing.  When the product launches all our source code will be available on Github.</p>

Everyone on our team has been tablet enthusiasts since before the original iPad was announced.  It's impossible to count how many tablets we've owned over the past few years.  The last few months were spent testing just about every hardware configuration you can imagine.  We knew we wanted to keep the price low, have long battery life and enough power to run apps and watch HD videos.  After all the testing we finally ended up with the combination of components that we felt gave us the best results.  Once this was done we began working with many hardware partners in China to figure out the best plan for manufacturing.  After successful prototypes were built and tested, the design and bill-of-materials were finalized.  The factory has the components ready to go and is now waiting for the go ahead from us to begin manufacturing.  We've estimated about 4 weeks from Indiegogo funding to delivery to our HQ in the US.  Once that happens then its about 2 weeks until it's delivered to your door.


Software
Much of the focus of tablets is on the hardware, but in reality the software is just as important.  Having spent much time on Android tablets we knew we wanted to give our customers options.  And we knew that a stock version of the OS had to be one of those options.  Our amazing software developer has been hard at work optimizing Android for the Root 101.  A good, clean Android build does wonders for both performance and battery life.  He's also completed ports of CyanogenMod and Paranoid Android, so as of right now we have 3 builds of Android running on our prototype devices.  There's still a small amount of fine tuning to be done in the code, but that will be finished well ahead of manufacturing.  When the product launches all our source code will be available on Github.

Stock Android 4.2

CyanongenMod 10.1

Paranoid Android 3.55
 
Tech Specs
The Root 101 has everything you need for a great tablet experience.  A great screen, long battery life, a dual core processor and all the connectivity options you want...WiFi, Bluetooth, Micro USB and MicroSD slot.  It even has a Mini HDMI out so you can output up to 1080P video from the tablet to your TV.  Here's the full list:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>IOTrain is a simple, small yet brilliant piece of innovation which allows Arduino to have as many digital IOs as you wish. Each module adds 24 IOs to your project and you can cascade multiple such modules to fulfill your project requirements</p>
<h3>Who We are</h3>
<p>I am Tushar Jambhekar, I own Jambhekar Automation Solutions.We are experts in electronics and PC based Industrial automation. For past 7 years we are in this field and in India we have provided services to companies like Whirlpool, John Deere, Emerson etc.</p>
<h3>The Story Behind IOTrain</h3>
<p>For quite some time I am working on Arduino. and it is awesome development platform . It simplifies the development a lot.</p>
<p>However when you select a particular Arduino board you are limiting the number of IOs that can be utilized in your project. E.g. UNO is having 14, Leonardo is having 20 whereas ADK has got 54. </p>
<p>If your projects needs more IOs; then things suddenly get quite tough. You might need to</p>
<ol>
<li>Design custom circuits</li>
<li>Implement complex protocols like SPI, I2C etc.</li>
<li>Spend many days in debugging code.</li>
<li>Struggle to comply with timing constraints.</li>
<li>Spend money on costly equipments to analyze timing characteristics.</li>
</ol>
<p>And so complexities pile up.</p>
<p><b>I wanted to eliminate all these complexities once for all.</b></p>
<p>I believe that developing small projects on Arduino is simple and <b>it should remain simple irrespective of size of project.</b></p>
<h3>Meet IOTrain and Say No To Complexities</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/90074/files/20130922235836-IOTrainModule.png?1379919516"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/90219/files/20130923022030-iotrainpinhead.png?1379928030"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>IO train is cascadable IO expander which goes well with Ardiuno philosophy. Each IOTrain Module has got 24 digital IOs. and you can cascade as many modules as you want till the time you don’t hit total of 65000 IOs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also for interfacing IOTrain to Arduino or compatible board you don’t need to learn much. <b>IOTrain comes with its own open source Arduino library</b>. Library functions are similar to Arduino’s digitalWrite and digitalRead functions</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Under the hood IO Train uses I2C protocol. During initialization of IOTrain auto detection algorithm in firmware detects the number of modules attached to i2c bus of Arduino. Each module on bus assign itself appropriate channel numbers (e.g. first module takes channel number 0-23, second module occupies 23-47 and so on.). and subsequent commands can use channel number for reading or writing status information on it.</p>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>IOTrain can be used to extend IOs on any Arduino or Arduino compatible board which has got hardware i2c interface. It consumes only two pins on Arduino and in return can happily give back hundreds of IOs.</p>
<p>Technically IO Train can be used by any device which is capable of communicating over i2c. but it will need IOTrain library to be ported for the device.</p>
<p>IOTrain works on 5V logic levels hence level shifter will be required for devices that do not work with 5V levels.(We or working on it and trying to make it work on both 5 and 3.3V levels)</p>
<p>Are you thinking about using<b> IOTrain with Raspberry PI</b>? We feel that its a great idea. and as soon as we hit the project goal we will introduce the stretched goal for porting IOTrain to RaspberryPi. We will also add 3.3V &lt;-&gt; 5V level shifter board required by raspberry pi as a perk</p>
<h3>What is Current Status of Project</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/90249/files/20130923031058-Workin.png?1379931058"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We have created 5 prototype boards for IOTrain. we have completed the development of firmware and we have also completed the IOTrain Library for Arduino.</p>
<p>By cascading 5 IOTrain modules we have tested it for up to 120 channels of input as well as outputs and it is working great</p>
<h3>What Needs To Be Done Yet</h3>
<p><b>Double layer PTH PCBs instead of curent single layer ones</b></p>
<p>Our current prototype PCBs are manufactured in house using single layer design. However for final product we will be using double layer PTH PCBs. design of new PCB is complete but manufacturing will be done immediately after completion of campaign. (Double layer PCBs always perform better than single layer PCBs hence this does not involve any risk)</p>
<p><b>One more prototype run</b></p>
<p>Our current prototype is working great however we will be creating one more prototype which will focus on making board compact and sexier.</p>
<p><b>Validate that IOTrain works for very very high channel counts</b></p>
<p>Theoretically IOTrain supports up to 65000 channels however we have tested it only up to 120 channels. Upon receiving of funds we will manufacture multiple boards and will test it for at least 1024 channels. (We have already simulated most of the situations like extended lengths of i2c bus etc. but we still need to test with lots and lots of cascaded boards)</p>
<p><b>Ensure quality of manufactured product using automated test equipment</b></p>
<p>We want to make sure that each module delivered to our customers is defect free. We are ready to invest time and money required for that. We already have plans for automated test system to test each manufactured module before dispatch.</p>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your support to turn this project into reality. To bring prices down we need to mass produce our modules and we need at least USD 7,500 to start producing boards. Funding of USD 10,000 or more will make our life more simpler though. So please Support us by picking biggest perk you can. By passionately picking bigger perk you are not only supporting for a cause but you are also receiving back a bigger reward.</p>

<h2><strong>Where We’re At</strong></h2>
<p>We have a clear plan to cross the finish line, and part of that plan relies on you. We have calculated that we need $50K to bring The Magic Case to the market. The funds are for the molds and for the production level (please keep in mind that this is a fixed project , that means if we don't reach our goal none of us gets The Magic Case and the c<span>ontributions are refunded). </span></p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of our timeline for the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>February</strong> - Indiegogo Campaign.</li>
<li>
<strong>March</strong> - Indiegogo Campaign Ends + DFM Evaluation And POs Issued.</li>
<li>
<strong>April</strong> - Tooling And Production.</li>
<li>
<strong>May</strong> - Production And Products Shipping.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h2><strong>A Little Bit More About The Project And Myself</strong></h2>
<p>I am an industrial designer and software engineer. I am looking for funding the production stage of this project in order to be able to produce The Magic Case for iPhone users and make it a reality.</p>
<p>I believe that The Magic Case with its useful functional features and its qualities, can help make iPhone cell communication tasks much practical and easy. </p>
<p>I put a lot of thought into the design of The Magic Case. I produced many prototypes and checked them of one by one until I got the present prototype that is perfect (Keep in mind that when the Magic Case will be produced from molds in mass production, it will look nicer more appealing, shinier and thin than the prototype in the video).</p>
<p>The Magic Case will be produced from high quality materials in the colors mentioned, and will come with 3 years warranty.</p>
<p>  </p>

The Magic Case overview
The Magic Case is a three-part system (a cover, front case and back case with hanger). The case’s two light frames are attached to each other with no extra parts. Put them one on top of the other and it clasps on the iPhone. The cover is made from polyurethane and magnets that click perfectly on the front and the back of the case and attached on the side to slide it smoothly from side to side (with no screws or adhesive).

 
Reduces Cell Radiation
From Apple iPhone's user manual:

""When on a call using the built-in audio receiver in iPhone, hold iPhone with the dock connector pointed down toward your shoulder to increase separation from the antenna. When using iPhone near your body for voice calls or for wireless data transmission over a cellular network, keep iPhone at least 15mm (5/8 inch) away from the body”

 

How The Magic Case protects you? 
Embedded inside The Magic Case's cover an industrial aluminum foil and 3 small aluminum parts plus mini antenna that after months of research we found the perfect way for casing them inside the cover. The result of it, is that the cover redirects cell phone radiation away from the user by up to 90% as was professionally tested by the ORDOS TECHNOLOGIES LABS LTD that are specialized on cell radiation research, safety and measurements. 
The Magic Case not only protects you from cell phone radiation while using the iPhone, it also protects your body from the radiation when the iPhone is placed in your pocket (The aluminum doesn't block the radiation your device need in order to communicate with cell phone towers because the mini antenna stabilizes the signal).

The slim yet sturdy Magic Case protects your iPhone screen and its back, including the buttons, speakers and connectors, so your iPhone is fully protected all around (The Magic Case drop tests finished successfully from a height of 8 feet indoor and outdoor, on a flat and rocky surfaces). The Magic Case is made from hard high quality plastic that covers an outer metal frame witch make's it durable and carefree when you take your iPhone out of your pocket.

 
Smart Panel
The breakthrough design with the precision cuts on the front cover of The Magic Case, permits the user full view of time and date display, and the other for slide and caller ID that make's no need to open The Magic Case to answer a call (needs only a simple slide to answer the call).
The covers are magnetic and click on the front and the back of The Magic Case (fits on both sides) and are designed to cover and protect the iPhone from external damage.  
The home button allows the iPhone to be used with The Magic Case closed and using SIRI is effortless.
The Magic Case's cover has also a perfect opening for the back camera and the receiver, and in no time you can remove the covers from the case.

iPhone Wake/Sleep 
Open The Magic Case's cover and the iPhone magically wakes up (turns itself on). Close it and the iPhone automatically goes into a sleep mode (turns itself off).
This feature occurs due to a perfect combination between The Magic Case and a special APP that will be release exclusively FREE for the buyers of The Magic Case.

 
Kickstand
The Magic Case serves as a stand for the iPhone, enabling landscape and portrait orientation at multiple angles - perfect for watching movies, typing, or making video calls
The Magic Case’s cover folds in just the right places to become the perfect FaceTime and movie-watching stand.

It also does double duty as a keyboard stand. Fold it back to tilt iPhone into a comfortable typing position.

The hanger opens up to portrait positions in multiple angles.

 
Mount
With The Magic Case’s strong, strategically placed magnets, you can take your iPhone to any magnetically responsive surface and mount it on the front or the back of it.

 
Car Holder
The Magic Case has a flexible hanger that helps place the iPhone in the car by hanging it over your car's internal mirror.

 
Hanger
The Magic Case conveniently hangs on a piece of equipment while you use your cell phone to time yourself, so basically you can hang it anywhere for multiple uses. For example you can use it as an holster, hang it on your bicycle, on your wall charger, on your pants, etc.
Hang your iPhone and take video or pictures while you ride or drive.
For fun, you can ""looping"" the phone with your finger and keeps the phone secure in your hand during everyday use.

 
Wallet
The wallet feature that is located on the back of The Magic Case helps perfectly secure up to two credit cards and three fold (to half) bills.

Bottle opener
The hanger of The Magic Case can be used also as a bottle opener. Just pull it from the back of the case and use it as a bottle opener (This bottle opener was optimized and tested on all types of bottles from Coke to beer).                                                

 
Cable Organizer
Wrap your earbud cords or charger cable without skipping a beat. When you're done using your earbuds, simply wrap them over your iPhone, snap the cover closed, and pop your earbuds right off. The Magic Case keeps your cords and charger cable neat and secure, whether in a bag, pocket, or attached to your iPhone.

Where We’re At
We have a clear plan to cross the finish line, and part of that plan relies on you. We have calculated that we need $50K to bring The Magic Case to the market. The funds are for the molds and for the production level (please keep in mind that this is a fixed project , that means if we don't reach our goal none of us gets The Magic Case and the contributions are refunded). 
Here is a breakdown of our timeline for the project:


February - Indiegogo Campaign.

March - Indiegogo Campaign Ends + DFM Evaluation And POs Issued.

April - Tooling And Production.

May - Production And Products Shipping.
 
A Little Bit More About The Project And Myself
I am an industrial designer and software engineer. I am looking for funding the production stage of this project in order to be able to produce The Magic Case for iPhone users and make it a reality.
I believe that The Magic Case with its useful functional features and its qualities, can help make iPhone cell communication tasks much practical and easy. 
I put a lot of thought into the design of The Magic Case. I produced many prototypes and checked them of one by one until I got the present prototype that is perfect (Keep in mind that when the Magic Case will be produced from molds in mass production, it will look nicer more appealing, shinier and thin than the prototype in the video).
The Magic Case will be produced from high quality materials in the colors mentioned, and will come with 3 years warranty.
  
FAQ
Will the magnets erase my iPhone memory?


No, your data is safe. iPhone use flash memory that isn't affected by magnetic fields.

Will the magnets interfere with my iPhone's performance?

No. The magnetic field of The Magic Case is far enough from the iPhone itself.
Will The Magic Case (and cover) cause antenna Interference or degrade my signal?


In our lab testing, we found no degradation of signal strength with the case (and the cover) on vs off.

Will the magnets harm my credit cards while using The Magic Case as a wallet?


We tested it for months in our labs and we use it every day and there is no harm to credit cards because they are far enough from the magnets and basically the magnets aren't strong enough to damage them.

We use The Magic Case to attached our iPhones to refrigerators, dry-erase boards, MacBook displays and other magnetically-responsive surfaces.

A simple concept behind Iceberg 

We decided to
create a unique dock for a unique device (Galaxy S4 or relative type) that is
not only a useful ergonomic dock but also an object of elaborate design.

High quality
Iceberg Dock is
made out of 100% high quality, solid aluminum. It is CNC-cuted, polished and anodized
and comes with a luxurious finishing in two colors that complement the device’s
tones (natural silver and black).


Details






 The CNC process



Use it the way you want
Now you can place
your smartphone device the way you want. 
Iceberg Dock is a
super-steady, double-docking station. You can charge your device at portrait
mode in 10° angle or use it for display at landscape mode in 45° angle. 
You can show
videos to your friends without holding the device in shaking hands or you can
skype-meet without an unstable, disturbing camera frame.







You can also charge your device while it
stands beautifully on your desk or next to your bed, and you can undock it
effortlessly due to its weight of 350gr.



You can even use
its back size as a card stand for your office or the whole object as a
beautiful iceberg-shaped paper weight.






Iceberg Dock is a functional object but a unique small-scale sculpture as well. It
includes all basic docking functions for smartphones like Galaxy S4, as it
enables charging, displaying, data transferring and even
‘laying’ of a second device on the other side.


Connection


You can plug in
your own cable when you need to use it as a charging station or as a data transfer station.
You can also remove the cable very easily when you are finished and move iceberg dock somewhere else. No screws,
no hand tools, no wasted time - just unplug and go. 

        ...plug, unplug and go!





Specifications


- Size: 10cm x 8cm x
7cm (W x D x H)
- Weight: ≈ 0,35 Kg- Material: Aluminum 6061, CNC Cut, Anodized- Input Connection: Female
micro USB type B- Output connection:
Male micro USB type B- Anti-slip/scratch pad base protection- Compatibility:
Galaxy S4 type or bottom micro-usb
charging phones

Personalize it!
Iceberg Dock can
be a perfect personalized gift. With the estimated delivery time around New Year's Eve, write your own engraved message on the Iceberg Dock and make a
wonderful present to the people you love.







Have a look at our unique perks




Choose your wallpaper
Below you can see our Iceberg wallpapers. You can either purchase them through our second perk, or you can get them as a present if you purchase one or two iceberg docks.

About us


Five months ago we decided to create the Iceberg
team: a team, with a mixture of designers and mechanical engineers who had
the fresh idea of the Iceberg Dock, a dock ideal for Galaxy S4 type
smartphones.
After observing the everyday use of Galaxy S4
type smartphones, we decided to launch a product that fulfills the needs of its
users. We put into it all our efforts for a uniquely designed object as well as
a fully functional gadget. 
Today, after experimenting with it for some
months, we are more than happy to share with you our new idea. Your trust and
support will help us make it true.
The four members of our team have different
complementary experience and backgrounds and this makes us a dynamic
group. 
Let us introduce ourselves to you:
Spiros Koutsaridis (mechanical engineer)
and Angeliki Malakasioti (architect and designer) who enthusiastically initiated the
project and designed the first model, Kostas Ikonomidis (mechanical
engineer) who actively run the project through all stages and realized our
first prototype, Giorgos Demenagas (mechanical engineer) who is
responsible for managing the communication of our campaign and pushing it forward.

The management of all technical difficulties was
accomplished thanks to our three mechanical engineers (Spiros Koutsaridis, Kostas
Ikonomidis, Giorgos Demenagas) who invented the right solutions at the
right moment. Angeliki Malakasioti created the audiovisual and communicational material for
Iceberg Dock [http://sliceavisage.wix.com/angeliki-malakasioti-web]. And all of us united our efforts by engaging in the creation of
our Indiegogo campaign.

We would also like to thank the following
people:
- Thodori Makrosava and Alki Ikonomidi for experimenting with their Galaxy S4.
- Bernd Montag for using his font ‘sensation’ in our campaign.

- Kevin Macleod for using his music in our video.

<p>After a few design iterations, we came up with a sleek one-piece design which is not only economical to make, but looks good too.

<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>The power adapter replaces the batteries and the battery cover ""button"" on the wireless keyboard and TrackPad. Simply remove the AA batteries, slide in the adapter, then twist it to lock it in just as you would the original battery cover.  Plug the attached USB connection into a USB port on your computer or into any USB ""wall wart"" charger for an endless supply of power.  There are no drivers to install as peripherals still use Bluetooth to communicate with the computer.  When you turn off your computer, the USB ports shut down, so  there is no need to remember to turn off your Trackpad or keyboard.  If you want to go wireless again, simply swap the adapter out for some batteries and the original battery cover.</p>

<p>Internally, the adapter contains the proper electronics to regulate the 5 volts from the USB port down to the 3 volts needed for the keyboard or TrackPad. It utilizes high quality surface mount low dropout voltage regulator and filtering capacitors. The end cap is milled from high quality stainless steel to match the look of the original battery cover, and the extension tube is milled from 6063 aluminum.  All parts are sourced or manufactured in the USA.</p>
<h1>Why we need your support...</h1>
<p>All the mechanical and electrical design work as well as the prototype is done, but manufacturing an <em>elegant </em>replacement battery cover is not cheap.  Notice our emphasis on it being elegant?  We believe our products should seamlessly compliment Apple's style and design.  So, in order to make this as affordable as possible, we need to place a large order and buy parts in bulk.  With your help we can start production very soon!</p>

<p>Some people are using the Apple wired keyboard and would like to plug the Power Adapter to it instead of into the comptuer.  So there is no need for a 3 ft cord.  Everyone will have the option to select how long they want the cord to be.  We will send out an email after the campaign closes to ask for the details then.</p>

<p>A number of TREKSTOR products reached the peak of the sales charts and established us a market leader. Cemented by legendary success stories with our first MP3 players, external hard drives and most important the “Volks” cooperation with BILD.de. But apart from that, we also established ourselves as an OEM partner for retail and industrial customers.</p>
<p>This includes the TREKSTOR WinPhone 4.7, which was released in March of 2015. But now it is time to replace the device with an updated and even better version. Introducing:</p>
<h2>TREKSTOR WINPHONE 5.0</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510832178/ace7mcuhnnctxaxdyvth.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Originally developed to accompany our B2B Smartagent, the device attracted some press interest during the 2017 IFA (Internationale Funkausstellung) in Berlin. And the press coverage lead to a large number of inquiries from individuals looking to replace their current Windows Mobile based smartphone, but who were not satisfied with the options available in the consumer market. Some people even suggested to put it on Kickstarter.</p>
<p>As TREKSTOR, priding ourselves for listening to our customers, we did just that. Check out the device below and decide for yourself.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where are we now?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The device is fully designed from a hardware and materials perspective.</li>
<li>On the software side, the device will receive an upgrade to the latest OS version right before manufacturing, to give you the best experience possible.</li>
<li>We also already found an ODM to produce the device once the campaign launched successfully.</li>
<li>Finally, our logistics team is standing by to deliver each individual device to you, once they landed in Germany and have undergone final quality control.</li>
<li>Should you ever have an issue, the TREKSTOR service and support team is standing by to assist you.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Features</h3>

</div></div>","For more than 15 years, TREKSTOR has a proven track record to foster trends and innovations in the IT and consumer electronics space. Being a medium-sized enterprise with international ambitions, we develop and market our products not only in Germany, but Europe and around the globe.  
A number of TREKSTOR products reached the peak of the sales charts and established us a market leader. Cemented by legendary success stories with our first MP3 players, external hard drives and most important the “Volks” cooperation with BILD.de. But apart from that, we also established ourselves as an OEM partner for retail and industrial customers.
This includes the TREKSTOR WinPhone 4.7, which was released in March of 2015. But now it is time to replace the device with an updated and even better version. Introducing:
TREKSTOR WINPHONE 5.0

Originally developed to accompany our B2B Smartagent, the device attracted some press interest during the 2017 IFA (Internationale Funkausstellung) in Berlin. And the press coverage lead to a large number of inquiries from individuals looking to replace their current Windows Mobile based smartphone, but who were not satisfied with the options available in the consumer market. Some people even suggested to put it on Kickstarter.
As TREKSTOR, priding ourselves for listening to our customers, we did just that. Check out the device below and decide for yourself.
 
Where are we now?

The device is fully designed from a hardware and materials perspective.
On the software side, the device will receive an upgrade to the latest OS version right before manufacturing, to give you the best experience possible.
We also already found an ODM to produce the device once the campaign launched successfully.
Finally, our logistics team is standing by to deliver each individual device to you, once they landed in Germany and have undergone final quality control.
Should you ever have an issue, the TREKSTOR service and support team is standing by to assist you.

<p>We plan to use the funds raised from this campaign in several ways. Until now, all costs associated with the project (hosting, domain registrations, etc.) have been funded out of pocket. All development has also been done in Nathan's spare time, when he's not working one of two other jobs and attending college as a full time student.</p>
<p>If the campaign gets funded, Nathan will quit his primary job to work on Vocal on a regular basis. This means working full-time for four months in the summer and one month in the winter, and a couple days per week throughout the rest of the year. <b>The funds will be used to pay for his living expenses for at least one full year </b>since he will be giving up his primary source of income,<b> and will also cover the costs of maintaining the project.</b></p>
<p><b>We also want to use the funds to pay other contributors, whether they be developers, designers, artists, or anyone else. </b>We think everyone deserves to be paid for the work they put into the project.</p>
<h3>Why Fixed Funding?</h3>
<p>Several people have asked why we went with a fixed funding campaign instead of using flexible funding. There are two main reasons we decided to do it this way:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The
$14,000 goal represents that absolute minimum Nathan would need to
pay for living expenses for a year. If we don't reach that goal,
full-time development simply isn't possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We
think that sometimes flexible funding is viewed less seriously and
used by projects and people to bring in money without a guarantee of
a final product. We want to make it clear that we are very serious
and passionate about our work.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing: Fundamental magnetic cables – the best cross device cable that connects all your devices automatically.

 
The new Fundamental magnetic cable solves all problems you have with your charging and synch cables!
Stop wasting your money on low quality cables that don’t last. We put 1 and 1 together: Best quality materials and newest technology:

One cable for all your devices (Lightning, Micro USB)
Stronger magnets
Stronger and tangle free braiding
Supports dual side data transfer and charging
LED Indicator  
Fast charging
Aluminium plugs

The result is an excellent cable that works with every Micro USB and Lightning (Apple) device. And never breaks.
It’s so simple: Our fundamental cables come with a reversible magnetic connector which connects instantly – without any need of turning it around.

 

Best materials for utmost quality:
- High force neodym magnets for best precision  
- Cloth coated cord for a tangle free use
- 18K gold-plated needles for long lasting and stable fast charging experience
- Copper core for relyable data transfers and super fast charging at the same time
- Highly resistant allumnium plug 
- LED indicator for easy use

No frustration with low quality and tangled cables!
We have checked the cable with several strict quality tests – here in Germany. The Fundamental cable meets all requirements by 100% to ensure long lasting pleasure!

 

 If you own a Fundamental cable you do not need any other! Our Fundamental magnetic cables fits to all your devices with micro-USB (Android) and Lightning port (Apple).
You will never need another cable again!

 

We all know that problem:
Breaking cables and connectors. That's frustrating and no one wants that! With our Fundamental cable you have on cable that outlasts all your devices!
One Fundamental cable costs much less money that buying 10 times bad quality cables!

Say „Good Bye“ to your low quality cables. You will buy our Fundamental Cable once – with full satisfaction!
We use the strongest and most efficient materials to make our Fundamental magnetic cables as strong and durable as possible.
With our Fundamental magnetic cables we can say that our cables are many times stronger than the average cables out there. We use anti-scratch aluminum for the plugs and a strong braiding for the cables to ensure perfect agility and durability. It’s even strong enough to make pull-ups with it.

 


 This is the next generation of magnetic cables: Stronger magnets that ever before!
You already have spent too much money on bad quality cables that just fit to one of your devices. Our Fundamental Cables connect instantly – on both sides! We use the next generation of strong magnets to ensure an immediate and strong instant connection.
Just let your cable do the work for you! Connect your phone just by one hand!
In contrary to most cables available on the market, the Fundamental cable features a automatic connection system with ultra-strong magnets. 

Our cable connects and disconnects without frustration. Just hold the cable near the phone and it will connect easily – in every occasion: Bed, car, office or just at home.

 

Annoyed of tangled cables all the time? Our perfectly selected materials will keep you free from tangled cables and give you perfect agility, strength and flexibility. 

 
 

 

 In contrast to most cables on the market our cables support data transfer as well as charging at highest speed - for Android and Apple devices!
That means for you less time plugged in – more time to make the best out of the day.
 

 

 Did you already had a device that broke because of water and dust in the charging port? Fundamental magnetic will change that! Using our cable will protect your phone from dust and dirt and extends the life of your device!

 


 



 

In average we charge our mobiles 1,32 times a day! That means 430 times frustration a year with bad fittig cables.
We at Fundamental have been working hard to change that. With our fundamental cable series we offer a cable that is suitable for daily use without any frustration.

<p><strong>Aladdin is a USB keyboard</strong>, not a USB drive. It remembers the keystrokes of your password, not passwords in text files. It saves you time whenever you need to enter passwords.</p>
<p>Aladdin also improves the current situation of people using short, simple or identical passwords everywhere by removing the need to memorise passwords.</p>
<p><em>""what if you lose it? It is a good question - but that is not what Aladdin is trying to solve - it is trying to solve a bigger problem - trying to remember,""</em> by security blogger <a href=""http://idiots-mind.blogspot.com/2012/12/aladdin-password-on-usb-stick.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""alapan"">alapan</a></p>
<p>Aladdin works with Windows, Mac, Linux as well as smartphones and tablets that accept USB keyboards (See FAQ).</p>
<p>Aladdin also works with passwords managers such as LastPass, KeePass and 1Password. After all, you still need a password to protect the safe!</p>
<p>Aladdin also works across remote sessions such as RDP, VNC, Synergy, SSH and Telnet.</p>
<p>Aladdin is fully open source.</p>

<h1>
<strong>Solution to Problem 1 - </strong><strong>Use Different Passwords<br/></strong>
</h1>
<h1>
<strong>Solution to Problem 2 - </strong><strong>Use Complex Passwords<br/></strong>
</h1>
<h1>
<strong>Solution to Problem 3 - </strong><strong>Use Long Passwords</strong>
</h1>
<p>However, these solutions actually create a new problem because mighty as we may be, we cannot remember so many long, complex, and different passwords. This leads back to problems 1, 2, 3. Remembering passwords may be a necessary evil in the past, but it doesn't have to stay that way.</p>
<p>Now, ask yourself, how do you open your front door? <em>""I use my key!""</em> you shouted. How do you unlock your car? The list goes on... We have used keys to unlock things for centuries so why not computers?</p>
<p><em>""But...keyboard...password...computer...""</em> I hear you muttered along those lines. Part of the problem is that computers have been using passwords for as long as they have existed. It is unlikely to change everything that's already built from the login screen to websites. However, shouldn't technology work for people, not the other way round?</p>
<p>What if there is something that can remember my password and unlock my computer &amp; websites just like a house key?</p>
<h1>Solution to Problems 1, 2, 3 - Aladdin</h1>
<p>Here, I proudly present to you - <strong>Aladdin: Open Source Hardware Key to Your Online Security</strong>. It is the key to your computer &amp; websites. You should treat it like your house key. Put it on your key chain and keep it with you at all times. OK, maybe not in the shower.</p>
<center>Aladdin Prototype 2 &amp; PC</center>
<span style=""font-size: xx-small;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;""><img alt=""Prototype 2 &amp; PC"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/555576/pictures/full/20121127024049-DSC08106-web.jpg?1354012852"" src="""" style="""" title=""Prototype 2 &amp; PC""/></span></span>
<p>In short, when you plug Aladdin into your computer, he types your password so you don't have to. Simple, isn't it? There is no software to be installed on your computer because it appears as another USB keyboard to your computer. Everything you need to use Aladdin already exists on your computers.</p>
<h1>How to Use Aladdin</h1>
<h2>Method 1 - Single Aladdin</h2>
You can simply unlock your computer as seen in the demo. It is usually used when it is more important to maintain physical security than worrying about being hacked. Of course, never leave your key and the lock together unattended. You can also protect your password safe with this method.<br/><h2>Method 2 - Single Aladdin</h2>
<p>Think of something you can remember, but different, let's say <span style=""color: blue;"">fb</span> for Facebook and <span style=""color: orange;"">link</span> for LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Then, coupled with a red Aladdin which outputs <span style=""color: red;"">chahb3Id</span>, you can set up your passwords like:</p>
<table border=""1""><tbody>
<tr>
<td><center><strong>Website</strong></center></td>
<td><center><strong>Password</strong></center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Facebook</td>
<td>
<span style=""color: blue;"">fb</span><span style=""color: red;"">chahb3Id</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LinkedIn</td>
<td>
<span style=""color: orange;"">link</span><span style=""color: red;"">chahb3Id</span>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Now your password is formed with something from your brain that's easy to remember, but different and something complex that's from Aladdin and the resulting password is long.</strong></p>
<h2>Method 3 - Multiple Aladdin</h2>
<p>You can simply unlock your computer as seen in the video, but some argues doing that is less secure so how about two Aladdin? You can make up at least 6 unique passwords by plugging them in up to two times individually as well as sequentially.</p>
<p>For example, if A is a red Aladdin key and B is a green Aladdin key, then they can make up to at least 6 unique passwords:</p>
<table border=""1""><tbody>
<tr>
<td><center><strong>Key</strong></center></td>
<td><center><strong>Password</strong></center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td><span style=""color: red;"">chahb3Id</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td><span style=""color: green;"">dah4Ohxi</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AA</td>
<td>
<span style=""color: red;"">chahb3Id</span><span style=""color: red;"">chahb3Id</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AB</td>
<td>
<span style=""color: red;"">chahb3Id</span><span style=""color: green;"">dah4Ohxi</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BA</td>
<td>
<span style=""color: green;"">dah4Ohxi</span><span style=""color: red;"">chahb3Id</span>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BB</td>
<td>
<span style=""color: green;"">dah4Ohxi</span><span style=""color: green;"">dah4Ohxi</span>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>With more Aladdin, the number increases very quickly due to permutation, and with just 3 Aladdin:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of 1-unit length passwords (1! + 1! + 1!) = 3</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of 2-unit length passwords (2! + 2! + 2!) = 6</strong></li>
<li><strong>Number of 3-unit length passwords (3! + 3! + 3!) = 18</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These make up 27 unique passwords, which should be more than enough to most people.</p>
<h2>Mixed Mode</h2>
<p>How about combining these methods? You can even invent your own method, e.g. instead of typing something before or after plugging in Aladdin, you can delete something after it's plugged in!</p>
<p>I personally use the mixed mode; I use a really long password as you've seen in the demo for my laptop because I never leave Aladdin alone with my laptop unattended. For online accounts, I used method 2 for social websites and methods 3 for banking sites.</p>
<h1><strong>Features</strong></h1>
<p>On its own, Aladdin can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlock your computer and websites;</li>
<li>Generate and store one random password;</li>
<li>Re-generate the stored password.</li>
</ul>
<p>With host software, it can also:</p>
<ul>

<h1>Most Asked Questions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Q: What if I lose my Aladdin?</li>
<li>A: Because Aladdin is mapping digital security to physical security, you would do what you do when you lose your house key, i.e. call a locksmith. Since it is for your computer, you'll ask a computer locksmith (Administrator) to reset your password. If it is for a website login, then you'll request a password reset email to be sent to you. Resetting password is just like replacing the lock in the physical world. Of course you can save yourself the trouble by having multiple Aladdin keys just like you have spare house keys.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Q: What if someone stole my Aladdin?</li>
<li>A: Report it to the police, seriously. You should do what you do when someone stole your house key. You should change your locks (passwords) as soon as possible. The thief would still need your home address or your login in order to gain access though.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Q: Compared to a house key, wouldn't it be easier for someone to pick up my Aladdin and plug into his computer so he knows my password while I have no idea my password was copied?</li>
<li>A: Compared to Aladdin, wouldn't it be easier for someone to pick up your house key and press it into a piece of soap so he now has a copy of your house key while you have no idea your house key was copied?</li>

Aladdin is a USB keyboard, not a USB drive. It remembers the keystrokes of your password, not passwords in text files. It saves you time whenever you need to enter passwords.
Aladdin also improves the current situation of people using short, simple or identical passwords everywhere by removing the need to memorise passwords.
""what if you lose it? It is a good question - but that is not what Aladdin is trying to solve - it is trying to solve a bigger problem - trying to remember,"" by security blogger alapan
Aladdin works with Windows, Mac, Linux as well as smartphones and tablets that accept USB keyboards (See FAQ).
Aladdin also works with passwords managers such as LastPass, KeePass and 1Password. After all, you still need a password to protect the safe!
Aladdin also works across remote sessions such as RDP, VNC, Synergy, SSH and Telnet.
Aladdin is fully open source.

Problem 3 - Short Passwords


25-GPU cluster cracks every standard Windows password in <6 hours | ars technica


A password-cracking expert has unveiled a computer cluster that can cycle through as many as 350 billion guesses per second. It's an almost unprecedented speed that can try every possible Windows passcode in the typical enterprise in less than six hours.



Solution to Problem 1 - Use Different Passwords


Solution to Problem 2 - Use Complex Passwords


Solution to Problem 3 - Use Long Passwords

However, these solutions actually create a new problem because mighty as we may be, we cannot remember so many long, complex, and different passwords. This leads back to problems 1, 2, 3. Remembering passwords may be a necessary evil in the past, but it doesn't have to stay that way.
Now, ask yourself, how do you open your front door? ""I use my key!"" you shouted. How do you unlock your car? The list goes on... We have used keys to unlock things for centuries so why not computers?
""But...keyboard...password...computer..."" I hear you muttered along those lines. Part of the problem is that computers have been using passwords for as long as they have existed. It is unlikely to change everything that's already built from the login screen to websites. However, shouldn't technology work for people, not the other way round?
What if there is something that can remember my password and unlock my computer & websites just like a house key?
Solution to Problems 1, 2, 3 - Aladdin
Here, I proudly present to you - Aladdin: Open Source Hardware Key to Your Online Security. It is the key to your computer & websites. You should treat it like your house key. Put it on your key chain and keep it with you at all times. OK, maybe not in the shower.
Aladdin Prototype 2 & PC

In short, when you plug Aladdin into your computer, he types your password so you don't have to. Simple, isn't it? There is no software to be installed on your computer because it appears as another USB keyboard to your computer. Everything you need to use Aladdin already exists on your computers.
How to Use Aladdin
Method 1 - Single Aladdin
You can simply unlock your computer as seen in the demo. It is usually used when it is more important to maintain physical security than worrying about being hacked. Of course, never leave your key and the lock together unattended. You can also protect your password safe with this method.Method 2 - Single Aladdin
Think of something you can remember, but different, let's say fb for Facebook and link for LinkedIn.
Then, coupled with a red Aladdin which outputs chahb3Id, you can set up your passwords like:


Website
Password


Facebook

fbchahb3Id



LinkedIn

linkchahb3Id



Now your password is formed with something from your brain that's easy to remember, but different and something complex that's from Aladdin and the resulting password is long.
Method 3 - Multiple Aladdin
You can simply unlock your computer as seen in the video, but some argues doing that is less secure so how about two Aladdin? You can make up at least 6 unique passwords by plugging them in up to two times individually as well as sequentially.
For example, if A is a red Aladdin key and B is a green Aladdin key, then they can make up to at least 6 unique passwords:


Key
Password


A
chahb3Id


B
dah4Ohxi


AA

chahb3Idchahb3Id



AB

chahb3Iddah4Ohxi



BA

dah4Ohxichahb3Id



BB

dah4Ohxidah4Ohxi



With more Aladdin, the number increases very quickly due to permutation, and with just 3 Aladdin:

Number of 1-unit length passwords (1! + 1! + 1!) = 3
Number of 2-unit length passwords (2! + 2! + 2!) = 6
Number of 3-unit length passwords (3! + 3! + 3!) = 18

These make up 27 unique passwords, which should be more than enough to most people.
Mixed Mode
How about combining these methods? You can even invent your own method, e.g. instead of typing something before or after plugging in Aladdin, you can delete something after it's plugged in!
I personally use the mixed mode; I use a really long password as you've seen in the demo for my laptop because I never leave Aladdin alone with my laptop unattended. For online accounts, I used method 2 for social websites and methods 3 for banking sites.
Features
On its own, Aladdin can:

Unlock your computer and websites;
Generate and store one random password;
Re-generate the stored password.

With host software, it can also:

Reset to its default state;
Change the length of the random password (default = 8, max 255);
Replace the stored password with your choice;
Switch between automatically enter the stored password or not (default = No).

Progress
When I had the idea, what I first did was doing a Google search. No surprise that there exist similar things, however, none of them are at the stage as a finished and affordable product. However, they provided great starting points. One, in particular, is Joonas Pihlajamaa's Code and Life blog - DIY USB password generator which Aladdin has improved upon. In collaboration with Joonas, Aladdin will be released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) too.

In the past few months, I've completed:
Prototyping - two working prototypes have been made, Prototype 1 with a breadboard with the circuits shown below, and Prototype 2 with a red pre-assembled PCB called AVR Stick from SparkFun as seen in the video. By combining the Atmel ATtiny85 micro controller and objective development's V-USB (an open source firmware-only USB driver), a viable USB device can be implemented totally based on open source software.

Funding
Nothing can be made with nothing so that's where you come in. In order to free everyone from the burden of memorising passwords, and make Aladdin a reality, it needs to tap into the economies of scale. This means a manufacturing run of 10,000 units minimum.

The funding will be used between Jan-Mar/2013 to do:

Insert user name;
Press Ctrl-Alt-Del;
Press Win-L;
Any combinations of above.

CAD Designing - cases that can be attached to the key chain will be designed and funders will vote on their favourite case which goes into production. It may or may not look like the photos shown and it is totally dependent on funders' votes.

PCB Designing - circuits need to be turned into a PCB that fit inside the case. Once a case is voted the favourite, a PCB will be laid within the footprint. One possible design is shown below.

Package Designing - a blister pack with instructions will be designed to protect Aladdin during transit.

<p>In a world teeming with pad computing devices, is there room for our Padseen device? Even though we have ""pad"" in our name, Padseen is definitely not a pad computing device.  It's different. It's what we call a ""cloud media player,"" and it fits quietly in your home and brings your connected media world one inch closer. </p>
<p>If you are one of the 100 million Instagram users, you surely will love the Padseen media player.  It's a fun, new way to enjoy Instagram photos in the home, office or anywhere you've got a Wi-Fi connection. But it's not just for Instagram. You can get Facebook and Flickr photo updates on Padseen as well. Twitter photos? You bet, we're adding all these cloud photo services one by one as we speak.  </p>

We designed Padseen with a careful balance of simplicity and usability in mind. It's infinitely customizable through useful cloud-connected apps.  We think your iPhone or Android phone is the best remote control. That's why we've included only two hardware buttons on Padseen and rely on the smartphone as its main interface. Use our free app to configure Padseen’s Wi-Fi connection, to manage the slideshow mode, and to link Padseen to your various social media accounts. Once it is set up the way you want it, Padseen goes to work, quietly pulling your designated media from the Internet. We plan to add as many social media set-up services as possible, allowing Padseen users to pick and choose right on their smartphones whatever they want to hear or see on the display.</p>

<h2><strong>Customize with Apps.</strong></h2>
<p>Apps bring Padseen to life. We have built an amazing Padseen app on both Android and iOS platforms for your use. For photos, you can now set up access credentials with Instagram, Facebook photo, and Flickr. You can also set up a Gmail account so that photos and videos can be sent directly to Padseen. Use the music control feature to play, pause or skip tracks on your phone with the touch of a button. We're working on a wake-me-up-with-the-weather-report app and a clock face app. These apps features will be the first, but more are in the works!  And when we add new features to the apps we can easily push them to you with an app update.</p>

Maybe you are with a company that needs a digital signage solution; Padseen is perfect for creating targeted promotions for hotels, cafes, and shops. Or maybe you want to create your own application for showing intimate family photos? How about a wake-me-up-with-music app?</p>

<h2><strong>How Padseen Works</strong></h2>
<p>Download the free Padseen app to your iPhone or Android phone. Use the app to set up Wi-Fi connectivity for Padseen over the air. Log in to your social media accounts such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter via the app. And bam! You're up and running. Photographs from your Instagram feed will start pushing to Padseen immediately; same for your Facebook and Flickr accounts. Use the Play/Pause button at the top to stop the photo slideshow and video and sound. And use the toggle button to switch photo display formats: show one large photo plus six thumbnail views, all thumbnail images, or one large photo plus text view. </p>

<p><strong>Q. </strong>What’s the screen resolution?   <strong>    A.</strong> It is 1024 X 600. </p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>Does the player stay on all the time?      <strong> A. </strong>Yes.  But the screen will turn off by a timer setup feature.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Does Padseen have a battery?<strong>      A. </strong>No, we designed Padseen to be a desktop device. This is not meant to be a portable device similar to iPad.  If it were, we would need to include an expensive battery in its design, and charge substantially more money for the Padseen purchase price. </p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why no touch screen? <strong>A. </strong>For the same reason we don't include a battery. It is not an iPad. We did not want to design an expensive device with a quirky touch screen and have to charge a high price for it.  Wait until you see how well the app phone controller works! </p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>Why use a 16 by 9, 10' LCD display?<strong>         A. </strong>This is the most widely used LCD display in the industry, so it provides the best value for the buck. Besides, we think providing a more diverse way of presenting photos is attractive and intriguing to the eye.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Where do you ship and is shipping free?<strong>        A. </strong>We are able to ship to an address in U.S., UK, Australia, Hong Kong, and other European countries directly from the manfaucturing location - Shenzhen China.

In a world teeming with pad computing devices, is there room for our Padseen device? Even though we have ""pad"" in our name, Padseen is definitely not a pad computing device.  It's different. It's what we call a ""cloud media player,"" and it fits quietly in your home and brings your connected media world one inch closer. 
If you are one of the 100 million Instagram users, you surely will love the Padseen media player.  It's a fun, new way to enjoy Instagram photos in the home, office or anywhere you've got a Wi-Fi connection. But it's not just for Instagram. You can get Facebook and Flickr photo updates on Padseen as well. Twitter photos? You bet, we're adding all these cloud photo services one by one as we speak.  

And the fun certainly doesn't end with photographs. Padseen starts with photos and then includes all the media you expect to see from an iPad: text, music, and video - all of them. 

Customize Your Social Media Experience By Using Your iPhone or Android Phone as the Remote Control.
Padseen is the first connected display product built for the mobile computing era. We designed Padseen with a careful balance of simplicity and usability in mind. It's infinitely customizable through useful cloud-connected apps.  We think your iPhone or Android phone is the best remote control.

<h1>Hi, we're Kevin Bartczak and Andy Biro,</h1>
<p>We're two friends with years of experience implementing security solutions in commercial and government business. A few months ago, we were talking about yet another breach of credit, debit and identity card security. We were frustrated with how the escalating fraud levels are currently hurting so many ordinary, normal people. Almost without exception, nearly every one of these people thought identity theft and credit card fraud would never happen to them, because it isn't well known just how easy it is.</p>
<p>At least, not by people on the right side of the law.</p>
<p>We decided we wanted to <strong>help stop the rising levels of fraud dead in its tracks.</strong> So we decided to test some ideas of how normal people could protect the cards they normally carried in a wallet or purse. It wasn't easy. It took in-depth experimentation, testing and consulting with specialists to find something affordable and effective enough for everyone. Finally, we believe we've managed to find a simple, but effective solution.</p>
<p>The result is GarbleCard.</p>
<p><img alt=""Front and Back of Garble"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.garblecard.com/IndiGoGo/Images/GC_Pair.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""GarbleCard""/></p>
<p>GarbleCard uses some high tech developed by th <strong>US Department of Defense</strong>, to block the signal being read from any nearby RFID chip. That's the chip you see on your credit cards these days, as well as in drivers licenses, passports, access cards and more.</p>
<p>Unlike anything else out there right now, GarbleCard <strong>works with any wallet</strong>, regardless of which side of the card it's on, cheaply, reliably and <strong>without bulking up your current wallet or needing any kind of batteries</strong>. GarbleCard is also the only solution that blocks both methods of reading your card: RFID <em>and</em> the traditional magnetic strip on the back. Because of the unique design though you can still use both wherever they were actually meant to be used (ie buying something with your credit card)..</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this keeps random people with a cheap card reader from buying stuff with your credit cards, stealing your identity for illegal purposes, getting access to places only you should have access to and more.</p>
<p>Now, all we need is your help to get the first batch mass produced and protecting people everywhere. But what actually is GarbleCard, and how do we know it protects against fraud that can affect you personally? Read this and find out:</p>

<h1>When Victims Include a Chief Justice, How at Risk are You?</h1>

<p class=""TSfontRed""><strong>No one is safe from identity theft -- not even a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</strong></p>
Recently, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts confirmed to The Associated Press, that his credit card account numbers had been compromised. He wasn't even able to buy a coffee without having to pay in Cash when he found out. Most likely it was by a criminal who had managed to fraudulently get his card details, possibly from it's smart chip or magnetic stripe, and had already been in the process of using them for illegal purposes. <br/><p>So, let me ask you a question. Do <strong>you</strong> use a credit card, passport or driver’s license with a chip or magnetic stripe on it? Chances are you actually have more than one. According to the Smart Card Association, about 100 million RFID enabled cards in are circulation under various names. Check your cards right now. Visa calls them “PayWave”, Mastercard dubs theirs “PayPass,” Discover issues them under the “Zip” name and American Express calls theirs “ExpressPay.” We're talking about basically any credit, ID or security card with a chip here (and more).</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.garblecard.com/IndiGoGo/Images/rfidCreditCard.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Even if you never use the features of the cards chip, do you know how easy it is for someone to? This lets them steal the details of your card and start using it to do anything you could (such as running up huge charges on a credit card, or identifying themselves as you from an ID card like a drivers license). Do you know how easy it is for them to start using your identity without your even realizing?</p>
<p>All it takes is for someone with a $50 device that they can buy on eBay right now, put it in a bag and walk by you on the street. That's it. Next thing you know you're getting credit card bills for thousands of dollars or worse, and even if you get it sorted out with the credit card company, it takes time, effort and hassle. We all end up paying for higher fees from credit card fraud eventually, too. When they steal your identity they can do much, much worse.</p>

<p><strong>In short, if you ever carry your license, passport or credit card without protection – and go anywhere where people can walk close by, your details can be stolen.</strong></p>

<p>When we realized just how simple and affordable credit card fraud and identity theft have become with the new smart cards, we were shocked. We were horrified. We thought someone would come up with a way to help protect us and the people we all care about.</p>
<p>Here we are though, years after the introduction of smart cards – and we as well as our friends and family, are still just as much at risk as ever. More so actually, as the machines needed to commit this fraud have become much cheaper and easier to get.</p>
<p>So we set out to find a way to stop these evildoers in their tracks. It had to be cheap enough that it could protect the people with little money; the people who need it the most. It had to be easy to use and it had to be effective.</p>
<p>After months of testing and experimenting with materials and manufacturing processes, <strong>we came up with a prototype that could be cheap, simple to use, convenient and effective</strong>. Take a look.</p>
 <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.garblecard.com/IndiGoGo/Images/howEasy.png"" longdesc=""http://www.garblecard.com/IndiGoGo/"" src="""" style=""""/><p> </p>

<p>Just keeping a GarbleCard in your wallet protects you by using shielding developed for the Department of Defence to protect their information and equipment. It prevents your cards from being read by passing card readers. This includes credit and debit cards as well as driver’s licenses, passports and any other card or document using a smart chip.</p>
<p>Take a look at how the current prototype works. What you're seeing here is essentially a complete, fully functional GarbleCard. The only differences to the finished product will be some final tweaks of the cover design (adding backers names etc) which are only cosmetic: </p>
<p>In tests with our existing prototypes, <strong>simply placing GarbleCard near your cards protects you from having your personal information being stolen</strong> consistently. Easy. You get increased security, convenience, it’s affordable, and it really works. And GarbleCard doesn't add any bulk to your wallet. It's also a constant reminder to keep your credit and debit cards secure when you’re out and about.</p>
<p>While reading the magnetic stripe in your purse or wallet is much harder for scammers than reading the chip, if they do try, Garblecard stops them there, too. Its shielding and larger magnetic stripe make Garblecard's fake information easier to pick up, so that's what gets read by their machine. Hasta la vista scammers!</p>

<p>There are many opinions and methods being used out there to try and thwart these forms of cybercrime. However, <strong>GarbleCard is the only solution</strong> that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's you use any wallet - even your current one.</li>
<li>Doesn't damage credit/debit/identity cards</li>
<li>Easily fits in your wallet, pocket or purse</li>
<li>Shields against most known hacking devices</li>
<li>Promotes awareness and security</li>
<li>Gives proof of protection to banks if cards are hacked</li>
<li>Is affordable... <em>and</em>
</li>
<li>Can be made available for non-profit fund-raising projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't carry a wallet, you can still get full protection anywhere just by placing GarbleCard between your credit card and the potential fraudster.</p>
<p>In fact, anywhere you are concerned you might be in an unsecured situation, like a bus terminal or airport, just make sure you hold both your cards together with GarbleCard in your hand. In our tests, we saw how GarbleCard is also effective used in this way, shielding the card completely from scammers.</p>

<p>You <strong>get two GarbleCards</strong> in all of the reward tiers here for a number of reasons. One is to help protect you if you use a double-sided wallet. You can also have one in your wallet and one in your hand, or just an extra card in case you lose one. And of course, it doesn't help your credit situation if your card is safe but your partner’s isn't, so we figure it's always a good idea to have a spare.</p>

<p><strong>$10 pledge:</strong> This is the double card package. Every pledge gets a two-pack set because of the extra protection that another card affords, as described above. The GarbleCard two-pack is delivered in a smart graphic package with simple directions and access to FAQs on our completed website.</p>
<p><strong>$20 pledge:</strong> A two-pack set of GarbleCards, plus we'll also include your name (only) on our website as a backer of our project. Everyone will receive an email from Kevin and Andy thanking them for their support and access to the GarbleCard blog and Facebook page so you can stay up to date with news and advice in GarbleCard's mission to eradicate this epidemic of RFID based cyber crime.</p>
<p><strong>$50 pledge:</strong> Be remembered permanently for having helped stop the most common form of cyber crime today. Pledge $50 and we'll use your first name and last initial or first initial and last name to create the background graphic noise on one of the two sides of GarbleCard. It took us a dozen or so tries to come up with this unique card design. We're sure you'll get a kick out of seeing your name on GarbleCard's design, everywhere.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>$100 pledge:</strong> This reward tier is even more exclusive and limited to the first 50 pledges, as there just isn't enough space on the card for more names. We'll use your first name and last initial or first initial and last name to create the word GARBLE on one of the two sides of GarbleCard. We need to leave enough space for our names, K Bartczak and A Biro too...after all, we want to be immortalized on GarbleCard with you!</p>

<p>In researching the potential demand for GarbleCard, we have read a great many articles, studies and interviews addressing Smart cards and the related RFID technology and applications. The links below are valuable explanations used, in part, to prepare this project for Indiegogo. If you are interested in learning more, articles like these are a good place to start:</p>

<p>This Indiegogo project is needed to raise the funds to mass manufacture the first ever production run of GarbleCard. It will be produced by the same companies that actually manufacturer credit cards already, however none of these are set up to produce cards with this kind of shielding technology. Accordingly, there are high costs, complex machine retooling and large minimum orders to get GarbleCard off the ground. It might be a cliché, but it’s true to say that without support of people like you on Indiegogo, this can't happen, and people everywhere would continue to be at risk of largely preventable fraud.</p>
<p>While we have working prototypes, to produce these in mass, we need your support. Our mission is to protect people from credit and identity theft. While the cards are cheap to produce, once the factory's equipment is set up, ultimately <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">we can only get started with your help</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Not only do we need the funds to produce the first production run of GarbleCard, but we need funds to inform people about how high the hacking risks are right now, and what can be done about it. We want to make this affordable enough that everyone can be protected. This may not be possible if we're forced to use some other funding options that have to maximize returns over protecting the largest number of people.</p>
<p>Even if you can't afford to pledge yourself, we need people just like you, sharing on social media. We need people to show the people they care about how to protect themselves. We're determined to stop the current wave of credit card and identity theft dead in it's tracks. Every pledge or social share you make helps to make it real.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

When Victims Include a Chief Justice, How at Risk are You?

No one is safe from identity theft -- not even a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
Recently, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts confirmed to The Associated Press, that his credit card account numbers had been compromised. He wasn't even able to buy a coffee without having to pay in Cash when he found out. Most likely it was by a criminal who had managed to fraudulently get his card details, possibly from it's smart chip or magnetic stripe, and had already been in the process of using them for illegal purposes. So, let me ask you a question. Do you use a credit card, passport or driver’s license with a chip or magnetic stripe on it? Chances are you actually have more than one. According to the Smart Card Association, about 100 million RFID enabled cards in are circulation under various names. Check your cards right now. Visa calls them “PayWave”, Mastercard dubs theirs “PayPass,” Discover issues them under the “Zip” name and American Express calls theirs “ExpressPay.” We're talking about basically any credit, ID or security card with a chip here (and more).

Even if you never use the features of the cards chip, do you know how easy it is for someone to? This lets them steal the details of your card and start using it to do anything you could (such as running up huge charges on a credit card, or identifying themselves as you from an ID card like a drivers license). Do you know how easy it is for them to start using your identity without your even realizing?
All it takes is for someone with a $50 device that they can buy on eBay right now, put it in a bag and walk by you on the street. That's it. Next thing you know you're getting credit card bills for thousands of dollars or worse, and even if you get it sorted out with the credit card company, it takes time, effort and hassle. We all end up paying for higher fees from credit card fraud eventually, too. When they steal your identity they can do much, much worse.

 
 
1. The Setup
The thief connects a cheap, readily available battery-powered card reader to a netbook. They put it in a briefcase, so you never even see it. Some phones have this technology buil right in.  Read more here at Consumer Reports.
2. The Swipe:
 
Fraudster carries briefcase close to your purse or pocket where identity and credit cards might be carried. The card reader reads your card details from a distance.
3. The Copy:
Safe elsewhere, the scammer writes your information onto a new, blank card. Now they have a fully working copy of your credit card or ID. How long it takes for you to find out depends on which illegal things they feel like using it for.

In short, if you ever carry your license, passport or credit card without protection – and go anywhere where people can walk close by, your details can be stolen.

When we realized just how simple and affordable credit card fraud and identity theft have become with the new smart cards, we were shocked. We were horrified. We thought someone would come up with a way to help protect us and the people we all care about.
Here we are though, years after the introduction of smart cards – and we as well as our friends and family, are still just as much at risk as ever. More so actually, as the machines needed to commit this fraud have become much cheaper and easier to get.
So we set out to find a way to stop these evildoers in their tracks. It had to be cheap enough that it could protect the people with little money; the people who need it the most. It had to be easy to use and it had to be effective.
After months of testing and experimenting with materials and manufacturing processes, we came up with a prototype that could be cheap, simple to use, convenient and effective. Take a look.
  
 
Just keeping a GarbleCard in your wallet protects you by using shielding developed for the Department of Defence to protect their information and equipment. It prevents your cards from being read by passing card readers. This includes credit and debit cards as well as driver’s licenses, passports and any other card or document using a smart chip.
Take a look at how the current prototype works. What you're seeing here is essentially a complete, fully functional GarbleCard. The only differences to the finished product will be some final tweaks of the cover design (adding backers names etc) which are only cosmetic: 
In tests with our existing prototypes, simply placing GarbleCard near your cards protects you from having your personal information being stolen consistently. Easy. You get increased security, convenience, it’s affordable, and it really works. And GarbleCard doesn't add any bulk to your wallet. It's also a constant reminder to keep your credit and debit cards secure when you’re out and about.
While reading the magnetic stripe in your purse or wallet is much harder for scammers than reading the chip, if they do try, Garblecard stops them there, too. Its shielding and larger magnetic stripe make Garblecard's fake information easier to pick up, so that's what gets read by their machine. Hasta la vista scammers!
 
 

 
 

There are many opinions and methods being used out there to try and thwart these forms of cybercrime. However, GarbleCard is the only solution that:

Let's you use any wallet - even your current one.
Doesn't damage credit/debit/identity cards
Easily fits in your wallet, pocket or purse
Shields against most known hacking devices
Promotes awareness and security
Gives proof of protection to banks if cards are hacked
Is affordable... and

Can be made available for non-profit fund-raising projects.

 
If you don't carry a wallet, you can still get full protection anywhere just by placing GarbleCard between your credit card and the potential fraudster.
In fact, anywhere you are concerned you might be in an unsecured situation, like a bus terminal or airport, just make sure you hold both your cards together with GarbleCard in your hand. In our tests, we saw how GarbleCard is also effective used in this way, shielding the card completely from scammers.
 


You get two GarbleCards in all of the reward tiers here for a number of reasons. One is to help protect you if you use a double-sided wallet. You can also have one in your wallet and one in your hand, or just an extra card in case you lose one. And of course, it doesn't help your credit situation if your card is safe but your partner’s isn't, so we figure it's always a good idea to have a spare.
 
 


$10 pledge: This is the double card package. Every pledge gets a two-pack set because of the extra protection that another card affords, as described above. The GarbleCard two-pack is delivered in a smart graphic package with simple directions and access to FAQs on our completed website.
$20 pledge: A two-pack set of GarbleCards, plus we'll also include your name (only) on our website as a backer of our project. Everyone will receive an email from Kevin and Andy thanking them for their support and access to the GarbleCard blog and Facebook page so you can stay up to date with news and advice in GarbleCard's mission to eradicate this epidemic of RFID based cyber crime.
$50 pledge: Be remembered permanently for having helped stop the most common form of cyber crime today. Pledge $50 and we'll use your first name and last initial or first initial and last name to create the background graphic noise on one of the two sides of GarbleCard. It took us a dozen or so tries to come up with this unique card design. We're sure you'll get a kick out of seeing your name on GarbleCard's design, everywhere.

 
$100 pledge: This reward tier is even more exclusive and limited to the first 50 pledges, as there just isn't enough space on the card for more names. We'll use your first name and last initial or first initial and last name to create the word GARBLE on one of the two sides of GarbleCard. We need to leave enough space for our names, K Bartczak and A Biro too...after all, we want to be immortalized on GarbleCard with you!

 

 
In researching the potential demand for GarbleCard, we have read a great many articles, studies and interviews addressing Smart cards and the related RFID technology and applications. The links below are valuable explanations used, in part, to prepare this project for Indiegogo. If you are interested in learning more, articles like these are a good place to start:
Newer cards can be hacked too. SmartCard Technology. How Smartcard Technology Works. Should I use my new RFID enabled Smartcard?Mythbusters banned from speaking about FRID chip by Visa and MastercardWho's been scanning your credit card?

 
This Indiegogo project is needed to raise the funds to mass manufacture the first ever production run of GarbleCard. It will be produced by the same companies that actually manufacturer credit cards already, however none of these are set up to produce cards with this kind of shielding technology. Accordingly, there are high costs, complex machine retooling and large minimum orders to get GarbleCard off the ground. It might be a cliché, but it’s true to say that without support of people like you on Indiegogo, this can't happen, and people everywhere would continue to be at risk of largely preventable fraud.
While we have working prototypes, to produce these in mass, we need your support. Our mission is to protect people from credit and identity theft. While the cards are cheap to produce, once the factory's equipment is set up, ultimately we can only get started with your help.
Not only do we need the funds to produce the first production run of GarbleCard, but we need funds to inform people about how high the hacking risks are right now, and what can be done about it. We want to make this affordable enough that everyone can be protected. This may not be possible if we're forced to use some other funding options that have to maximize returns over protecting the largest number of people.
Even if you can't afford to pledge yourself, we need people just like you, sharing on social media. We need people to show the people they care about how to protect themselves. We're determined to stop the current wave of credit card and identity theft dead in it's tracks. Every pledge or social share you make helps to make it real.
Thank you!

<h2 class=""article-right""><strong><span class=""article-right-heading"">So what is the ZBand all about?</span></strong></h2>
<p class=""article-right"">The ZBand is a simple idea. It is a silent alarm wristband that vibrates to give you a gentle awakening without disturbing those near you. You set your alarm using your android device which communicates with the ZBand. When designing the ZBand we kept simplicity in mind and designed it to be small, light, comfortable, affordable and user friendly. The principle of the ZBand is simplicity, as Steve Jobs once said ""Simple can be harder than complex. You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end, because once you get there, you can move mountains""</p>
<h3><strong>Who is the ZBand for?</strong></h3>
<p class=""article-wide-left"">Tired of being woken up by your partner's alarm in the morning? Don't want to wake the children in the next room or your newborn beside you? Or do you just hate the sound of alarms? Then the ZBand is for you. The ZBand is ideal for those who don't like an audio alarm bellowing out first thing in the morning. It is perfect for couples getting up at different times or for students or backpackers staying in dorms. The ZBand is also very useful for people with hearing difficulties where it can be used as a morning alarm or to alert the wearer of different times of the day.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Ho</strong><span class=""article-left-heading""><strong>w does the ZBand work?</strong> </span>
</h3>
<p>5 simple steps:</p>
<p>1. Download our free Android app to your phone or tablet</p>
<p>2. Pair the ZBand with an android Smartphone or tablet using Bluetooth</p>
<p>3. Turn on the ZBand by pressing the button on the wristband and then press the connect button on the ZBand app.</p>
<p>4. When connected use the 3 toggles on the top of the screen choose to set alarm times and frequency of alarms, snooze functions or vibration strength. At the bottom of the screen press the save button and the ZBand will vibrate to confirm the function was saved. Then, the App disconnects from the ZBand.</p>

<div class=""article-wide-left"">I'm a guy in my 30s from a great place called County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland. I never liked noisy alarms and in the summer of 2009 came up with an idea for a silent alarm. Many people have great ideas but just do not have the time to pursue them. Having thought about the ZBand for several months, in January 2010 I decided it was time to do or die.

<p>Our first prototype was developed based off the original Bluetooth 2.0 version. This was a proof of concept project and allowed us to iron out any issues and to focus on getting Postifier to do exactly what it is suppose to do.</p>
<p>Once we were satisfied with the results, we started work on the next generation Bluetooth SMART (Low Energy) version using a TI system on chip module. We chose this as it increased the battery life significantly and we are achieving between 6 to 9 months life span.</p>
<p>The size of Postifier is also important. We wanted something that sat inside the postbox and wasn't obtrusive. We have managed to squeeze all the components into a size similar to a pack of gum.</p>
<p>We partnered up with experts in the electronics field specialising in sensors and wireless technology. Our engineers have spent the last 8 months designing several PCBs, coding firmware and testing many different sensors and Bluetooth modules.</p>
<p>Real world testing has been completed and we are extremely happy with the results. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">We felt that it was time to take it to <strong>INDIEGOGO</strong> and get your support.</span></p>

Say goodbye to checking an empty Postbox!
The postbox has been around for centuries. We check them every day before entering the comfort of our home, apartment or flat and far too often find it's empty. Postifier is about to change all that.
Postifier was designed to provide the solution to those pointless frustrating walks to your postbox and back, empty handed. With smartphones as popular as ever we developed a device which sends an instant notification to your smartphone if post arrived during the day.

Postifier supports iOS and Android
Uses Bluetooth SMART (Low Energy)
Has a battery life of between 6 to 9 months
Average pairing range of 30metres or 100feet


Perfect for these situations


For the elderly and those with mobility impairment - Prevent them making fruitless trips to check an empty Postbox.
Long driveways - save those walks back down the driveway or having to get out of your car to check your postbox.
When carrying heavy bags - save the hassle of having to put down your bags whilst trying to locate your postbox keys.
When you are inside your home and waiting for the post - you can go to the front door with your smartphone and you will know if the post has arrived (even more useful when its raining and you don't fancy that walk outside in the cold).
Extreme temperatures or just pure laziness.

    
Where we are at

Our first prototype was developed based off the original Bluetooth 2.0 version. This was a proof of concept project and allowed us to iron out any issues and to focus on getting Postifier to do exactly what it is suppose to do.
Once we were satisfied with the results, we started work on the next generation Bluetooth SMART (Low Energy) version using a TI system on chip module. We chose this as it increased the battery life significantly and we are achieving between 6 to 9 months life span.
The size of Postifier is also important. We wanted something that sat inside the postbox and wasn't obtrusive. We have managed to squeeze all the components into a size similar to a pack of gum.
We partnered up with experts in the electronics field specialising in sensors and wireless technology. Our engineers have spent the last 8 months designing several PCBs, coding firmware and testing many different sensors and Bluetooth modules.
Real world testing has been completed and we are extremely happy with the results. We felt that it was time to take it to INDIEGOGO and get your support.
Why we need your help
All internal electronics, firmware, connectivity and iPhone app is complete. We focused all our efforts in getting this core area developed first. However we still have work to do.
We are asking for $30,000 which will go directly to:

The design of the custom, small and weatherproof enclosure
Final PCB revision

Component order/procurement (Initial estimated production run of at least 500 units)
Component assembly
Regulatory testing and approval
Android application development
Packaging design

With the funds raised we will be able to achieve all of the above and get Postifier into your postbox.
Here's How It Works
Postifier has reusuable adhesive, so you stick it to the inside roof panel of your postbox. The sensor detects change in infrared light when post is inserted into your postbox. The Bluetooth module then activates and waits for pairing with your smartphone.
You need Bluetooth enabled and the application running (minimised) in background and that’s all there is to it. You will now be notified on your smartphone before you reach your postbox, or when you drive into your driveway and never again open an empty postbox!
Once the notification appears on your smartphone, the application opens and you press OK. This will get Postifier ready for the following day. It really is that easy!

Time is everywhere, it's on your
wrist, going to work has a time, sharing a picture on Facebook has a timestamp.
We want to give you back your time and focus on the moments that happened and
where they took place.
We all have had that feeling that we vaguely
remember something but can't recall it completely. Isn't it sad that we sort of
forget such moments? Facebook isn't quite convenient to search back through the
moments that we once put up there. It's just a constant stream of information
coming your way which can range from funny videos to selfies. But, what about
those moments that you really care about? We want to put those memories in a
bigger spotlight, we want to give it its own place on the map.Hi Indiegogo, we are Windorado and we are
based in South-Korea. We developed an app (MapChat) that gives users a new way
of interacting with each other. We offer chatting with friends, chatting with
random people, sharing pictures and videos ... the interesting thing of this is
that it all happens on Google Maps.
 MapChat is a more visual representation of
the usual timelines we are used to see in Facebook, Twitter, etc. You can leave
so-called footprints (Video/Pictures/Text) at your location and these are then
visible to others. Instead of seeing things chronologically like we do on our
timelines.
The ability to see who is using the app
around you on the map makes it also possible to talk and interact with other
people you might not even know. 
What makes us different from all the other apps out there?
MapChat
is our visualization of how an app can be different when it
comes to social media apps.We do this by utilizing what we are already
familiar with, Google Maps, and using it as our platform. Together with the map you can record your moments and never forget them. MapChat becomes your personal
map of memories.We all know how both Twitter and Facebook overflows us with information from several sources. It used to be just a place for friends and family to tell us they are celebrating the birthday of Grandma and how she is blowing out her candles. But now it has become the source for all kinds of news. We are watching dancing cats on Facebook and reading the news on Twitter. We are taking a step back with our app and bring back the social in social.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">There are Xiobot devices to monitor and control
everything in your home or business. </span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You could place an environmental sensor anywhere and
you’d instantly be able to monitor the climate in your surroundings. Put a
garden sensor between your flowers and it’ll tell you about the air temperature
in your yard and the moisture content of your soil. Attach a Xiobot control to
your sprinkler system and manage your landscaping better by precisely
regulating your watering.  Connect all of
your Xiobot devices with a Xiobot Intelligent Controller and you’ll be able to
securely monitor and control everything from anywhere across the Internet!</span></p>
<p></p>
<h1>What are Xiobots?<br/>
</h1>
<h4>
<b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Xiobots are
tiny, durable, wireless devices — each with its own embedded microprocessor and
integrated Bluetooth transceiver — which can operate on a network or the
Internet through a Xiobot Intelligent Controller; or, directly with your
Bluetooth 4.0-enabled smartphone, tablet, or PC.</b><br/>
</h4>
<p><b>What can Xiobots do?</b>
Measure and control your environment — manage and automate your world.</p>
<p><b>Are Xiobots expensive?</b>
No. Xiobots will use cutting-edge technologies, components, and manufacturing
methodologies whose costs have been reduced by large-scale production. They
will be a bargain!</p>
<p><b>How do Xiobots interact with you?</b>
Xiobot sensors can immediately update Bluetooth 4.0-enabled smartphones,
tablets, and PCs (that are within range) with status information; or, operate
and send text and e-mail messages to you through a network or the Internet
using a Xiobot Intelligent Controller.</p>
<p><b>How ""tiny"" are Xiobots?</b>
The smallest wireless sensors will be about the size of a lipstick case. </p>
<p><b>What does wireless connectivity do?</b>
Connecting sensors and devices to a centralized control system is the
proverbial ""last 100 feet"" problem. And that is: how to get all
elements connected at minimal cost in terms of time and material. Wireless
technology makes a distributed control system truly ""plug ’n play"".</p>
<p><b>What if you are unsure about
Bluetooth 4.0 compatibility?</b> Not a problem... if your
smartphone, tablet, or PC doesn’t have Bluetooth 4.0 compatibility, the Xiobot
system includes intelligent controllers that allow any device with a web
browser to interact with Xiobots. </p>
<p><b>What does a ""Xiobot Intelligent
Controller"" do?</b> A controller offers seamless access
to your Xiobots locally (on your Local Area Network) and across the Internet —
providing you with real-time information from your Xiobot devices and giving
you remote connectivity to your Xiobot controls.  Xiobot Intelligent Controllers include a micro-processor
that automatically performs scheduled and programmable functions and executes useful apps.</p>

like reading temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity — and complex
operations such as connecting to ‘real world’ systems and equipment. They can:
switch low-power electrical signals (controlling heating and air conditioning
systems); switch 110-220 VAC loads (high-power, household electrical lines);
interface with your existing security system or sprinkler controls; or,
replicate IR remote controls when used with our Entertainment System app (which
will give you control of your television and entertainment equipment like
you’ve never had before). And, they can connect to and interact with other home
and building automation systems.</span></p></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
</span></p>
<p>Xiobots are easy to set-up and use;
will typically operate for over a year with a single set of batteries; and,
come with free software applications for your smartphone (iPhone or Android),
tablet, or PC. An intelligent controller allows you to access your Xiobots
across your local network or remotely through the Internet. The intelligent
controller is a microcomputer that stores apps and information; allows your
Xiobots to respond to scripted and scheduled (timer-initiated) commands; and,
to act upon monitored conditions or events (such as detected temperature
changes or a status change in a sensor or detected signal). A cloud service
will be available to extend the capabilities of Xiobots even further.</p>
<p>The Xiobot system is
extensible... we are committed to a product architecture that will evolve to
fulfill future opportunities for both innovative hardware and software.  The devices listed above are just some of the
Xiobot products on our drawing board.</p>

<h3>Xiobots = Great Hardware + Great Software</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We understand that you’ll demand hardware that can be installed with apps that can be configured without opening an installation manual.  We know that you’ll want apps that’ll get you the information you need as quickly as possible and give you the control you expect.</p>
<p>We’ll deliver.  We are committed to producing sophisticated devices whose functionality, reliability, and performance are an outstanding value; and, to creating the most efficient and easy-to-use apps possible.  Every app will be intuitively obvious to use and updated automatically as it is improved.  Every device will evolve and exciting new designs will   be forthcoming.  We are devoted to automation technology — it’s who we are!</p>
<p>Take the Environment Sensor device for example.  It operates with an app that lets you scroll through all similar devices within your Xiobot domain.  Once you select the specific sensor that you want to monitor, the app displays the pertinent information with the presentation settings you’ve previously selected.  You’ll see a calibrated temperature reading, relative humidity, and barometric pressure. You’ll see graphical trends showing highs and lows for each parameter over a specified timespan.  On another page, you’ll be able to select high and low warning and alert settings and the optional actions that you want an intelligent controller to take when conditional events occur.</p>
<p>Intelligent controllers will feature easily navigated  interfaces that’ll make condition monitoring, event handling, scheduling, and scripting actions easy to set-up.</p>
<p>We know that “software makes hardware happen”!</p>

<p style=""""></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: left;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What good are electronic sensors if YOU need to monitor them?</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If you have a Xiobot Intelligent Controller or a Xiobot PC interface or you use our Cloud Service (which operates through an intelligent controller or PC), your Xiobot domain can be automated!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">An intelligent controller provides the processing power to monitor all of your sensors (and all of the different types of sensors) in real time and to respond to conditions and events with scripted actions.  Your Xiobot controller can even interact with other automation systems (extending capabilities even further).</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Automation implies that your Xiobot controls will operate devices and equipment which they are connected  to — executing actions determined by a scripted set of commands (directed by conditions being monitored, or triggered through events being detected, by Xiobot sensors); and, that you can have warnings and alerts sent to you (or any number of other recipients) by text message or e-mail.  Automation allows your sensor information to be perpetually logged, reported, or analyzed; and, makes it possible for Xiobot controls to be activated by your pre-scripted commands or by an app.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">You’ll use a specific sensor for a particular task; and, when a potentially catastrophic or important event occurs, your Xiobot Intelligent Controller — running an appropriate app — can respond to it automatically and immediately.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">For instance, if you need to know when a compressor or pump has started or failed, use a Passive AC Sensor to alert an appropriate automation app or to execute a specific command script.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">Utilize aggregate information from multiple environment sensors to optimize and control your heating and air conditioning system with the Xiobot thermostat app. The app will perform a parametric evaluation of the temperature conditions monitored by selected sensors — integrating several other factors (such as time of day, day of the year, room size, outdoor temperature trends, room occupancy, etc.) — and determines when to activate your HVAC system and which dampers to open and close.  The result?  You’ll experience more effective heating and cooling — keeping you much more comfortable while reducing your HVAC costs.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">Use a Garden Sensor to sense the watering needs of your garden — then, use an 8-output, high-power relay control to operate up to eight zones of sprinklers.  (Simply use multiple Xiobot controls if you have more than eight zones.)  With our highly-integrated software apps, you can predict watering needs based upon outside air temperature trends and the detailed information from your array of Garden Sensors.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">Use the structured, user interface in an intelligent controller to create “IF / THEN” actions to respond to the detailed information monitored from your Xiobots.  You’ll even be able to script complex actions containing multi-step conditional events.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">Scheduled actions will enable you to control your Xiobots based on clock time — and, include other time-based functions such as delays, randomly timed events, timed offsets from sunrise and sunset, days of the week, month, or calendar, and much more!</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">The Xiobot system is all about building a coherent system of devices and software applications tailored to effectively automate your home, building, or industrial process.  </span><br/></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">It's all about connectivity</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"">Just as there are countless ways to use Xiobots, there are many methods to connect and control your Xiobot domain.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"">You can use Xiobot sensors or controls by themselves — operating them directly with your Bluetooth 4.0-enabled iOS or Android smartphone through a free, downloadable, device-specific app.  Simply put the battery into a device to power it; then, run the app to configure it — that’s all there is to it!  You’ll be set-up to monitor a sensor or operate a control in minutes!</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"">And by the way... if your older smartphone or tablet doesn’t have Bluetooth 4.0 compatibility, you can still use a Xiobot Intelligent Controller to connect to your Xiobots. [Read onward and see how!]</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"">An optional USB interface enables your Windows® PC to access a Xiobot domain. Your smartphone will still be able to control your Xiobots directly; and as long as your PC is powered and running the Xiobot controller app, it can execute pre-programmed commands and respond to monitored conditions and events. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"">With a PC’s capacity to execute scripted actions, you’ll be well on your way to automating your sensors and creating a fully functional control system for your home or facility.  The Xiobot controller app can also provide bi-directional access to Xiobots across the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"">For the ultimate integration experience, you’ll be able to access Xiobots from your local area network with either a wireless (Wi-Fi) or cabled (Ethernet) intelligent controller. The intelligent controller will store pre-programmed commands and respond with scripted actions independently of your PC; and, it can act as a bridge that lets your Xiobots operate across the Internet as well. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"">If necessary, you’ll be able to overcome any wireless range limitations (inherent in Bluetooth technology) by setting-up multiple intelligent controllers; so, your Xiobot domain can extend as far as your imagination will permit.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"">Look at these typical configurations to determine which is best for you:</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;""></span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Basic connectivity allows you to interact with your Xiobots with minimal infrastructure. Your smartphone or tablet (with Bluetooth 4.0) can use its native Bluetooth connectivity to link directly to a Xiobot.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/76507/files/20130915214403-Xiobot_Image_8.jpg?1379306643"" src="""" style=""width: 566.5246753246754px; height: 384px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"">IP connectivity (over an Ethernet or Wi-Fi LAN) allows your Xiobots to be accessible through the Internet — either communicating with you via a remote user interface or connected to our basic Cloud Service.  (The cloud service makes it possible for your Xiobots to be addressable through the Internet even if the broadband connection at the location where your Xiobots are physically located is only serviced by a dynamic IP address.)<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"">The intelligent controller will routinely monitor your Xiobots and can respond instantaneously with scripted command responses (based upon conditions and sensor events) as necessary.  Additionally, scripted commands can automate scheduled (based upon time of day, day of week, day of month, calendar date, etc.) and recurring actions of Xiobot controls.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"">For example, visualize a pool sensor sending water level information to the controller that commands the device which activates the pool’s water fill valve; or, imagine multiple environmental sensors furnishing information to the controls that operate an HVAC system and open or close selected vents and dampers or operate fans to most efficiently and comfortably manage the environment of your home or building.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"">Alert events and monitored conditions can even trigger an intelligent controller to send you text or e-mail messages; so, you’ll know exactly what you need to know about your Xiobot domain as soon as possible.  And if you have installed an intelligent controller, your PC won’t need to be powered on — because the intelligent controller is a fully-functional, standalone processor!<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;""></span></p>

<p><b>Who are we? </b></p>
<p>We are a small team of engineers seeking to launch a product.  Our background encompasses decades of system design and electronics engineering — producing aerospace, scientific, and commercial information technology solutions — and (literally) several lifetimes of extensive and diverse software development experience.</p>
<p><b>What makes Xiobots a viable solution?</b></p>
<p>We’re taking a proven architecture from a wired modality to wireless.</p>
<p>Connecting sensors to a controller or data recorder is the proverbial “last 100 feet” problem —that is: how to get devices connected?  Do you spend countless hours stringing cabling through walls, within ceilings, around difficult to reach areas; or, do you rely upon wireless technology to solve that problem for you?  The answer is obvious — and that’s why we’ve engineered Bluetooth connectivity into our Xiobot design.</p>
<p><b>What are our differentiators?</b></p>
<p>Features, design, quality of construction, the scope of our solution. We are intent upon bringing you cutting-edge technology and proving that “high-tech” does not need to be high cost.</p>
<p><b>What are our product development plans?</b></p>
<p>The Xiobot system is EXTENSIBLE — and we intend to produce new devices as opportunities arise.  We have several devices already designed that we did not enumerate in the offerings of this campaign.</p>
<p><b>Is automation complex?</b></p>
<p>We looked at automation as a systemic function and understood that ease of implementation begins with comprehensive product engineering from the outset.  We started with a product concept that was rock solid from the ground up and built low-cost, wired Xiobot device prototypes.  We designed sensors, controls, and controllers with the sort of software and hardware integration that could effectively deliver  an elegant solution. Then, we added wireless Bluetooth connectivity to our design to simplify installation..  </p>
<p>Xiobots can take time-consuming and distracting tasks and reliably automate them — resulting in greater convenience, accuracy, and safety for you.</p>
<p><b>Are there any risks or challenges?</b></p>
<p>None.  We are using a circuit design [from the Bluetooth chip manufacturer] that has previously passed F.C.C. compliance testing and is already approved for our product.</p>
<p>We are members of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) and have developed our products in compliance with their standards, guidelines, and best practices.</p>
<p><b>How will we use the funds derived from this campaign?</b></p>
<p>There is equipment to purchase, fabrication processes to contract, and tooling required to take our design into production; and, we’ll need additional development resources to accomplish remaining engineering tasks.  Naturally, components, sub-assemblies, fixtures, and other elements of the manufacturing process will be needed as well.</p>
<p>We will create jobs... specifically: manufacturing engineers, production personnel, customer service people, and marketing and sales specialists.  [NB: We are not promoting a bloated and over-stated campaign!  We strongly believe in the viability and potential commercial success of the Xiobot product and feel that once this product is launched, we will have considerable momentum to carry it to the next level.]</p>
<p><b>What are the major steps remaining to get into production?</b></p>
<p>We will finalize our product engineering and concentrate on manufacturing processes. </p>
<p>We will set-up the production equipment, get people trained to use it, and begin the process of tooling-up for each of the product assembly and fulfillment steps.</p>
<p>We will complete develop the user interface of our prototype software — creating the polished apps that you will use.  </p>
<p>We will design,  implement, and qualify our proposed Cloud Service.  </p>
<p>We will test (and test and test again) our products to guarantee that they will meet the highest standards of performance and quality.</p>
<p>We are confident that we can accomplish these tasks within two to three months from the conclusion of a successful campaign.</p>
<p><b>What is our business plan?</b></p>
<p>We will sell Xiobot devices directly through a web portal.  We’ll make plans for more extensive distribution — including opportunities for third-party installers and servicers.</p>
<p>We intend to energetically promote the Xiobot product to insure its broad adoption.</p>
<p><b>Will Xiobots be available through resellers and distributors?</b></p>
<p>Yes.  If you are a reseller or distributor and Xiobots are of interest to you, please contact us.</p>
<p><b>What other incentives are there for contributing to this campaign?</b></p>
<p>Aside from the tangible satisfaction that you’ll receive in the knowledge that you will directly help create jobs and bring economic opportunity to others; you will also receive attractive, reliable, practical, cutting-edge technology at an attractive introductory price.</p>
<p>In addition, you will receive a 10% discount for all future purchases of Xiobot products.</p>
<p><b>What if your smartphone, tablet, or PC isn’t Bluetooth 4.0-enabled?</b></p>
<p>Not a problem!  If you have a Xiobot Intelligent Controller, it will allow any user device with a web browser to access your Xiobot domain through your device’s wireless or Ethernet connectivity.  </p>
<p><b>How big will these devices be?</b></p>
<p>The designs of plastic cases for each of the Xiobot devices haven’t been finalized; but, we can definitely tell you that they’ll be small — for example, about 1/2” by 3/8” by 2” (about the size of a lipstick case) for the environment sensor and similarly small for most of the other sensors.</p>
<p><b>Are batteries included?</b></p>
<p>Yes... and, Xiobots will incorporate circuitry that will maximize battery longevity.  We expect batteries to perform well under normal conditions and have based our estimates accordingly.  Still, we’ll want to know exactly how well; so for each device purchased, you’ll receive the first replacement battery(ies) absolutely free (including shipping and handling) when you fill-out a short, on-line, product performance survey.</p>
<p><b>What about wireless performance?</b></p>
<p>Xiobots use low-energy Bluetooth technology and are subject to the constraints and physics of radio frequency (RF) communication.  We believe that performance for distance should reach roughly 100 feet (30 meters).  Unless you are locating devices behind extremely dense materials (concrete, steel, trees, waterfalls, etc.) or have an exceptionally ‘noisy’ RF environment, wireless performance should be good.  (Note: We designed the intelligent controller system to accommodate the possible need for RF ‘repeaters’ throughout a Xiobot domain as a solution for limited or marginal RF performance situations).</p>
<p><b>Where will Xiobot apps be available? </b> </p>
<p>Apps will be freely downloadable depending upon the specific target device.  For iOS smartphones and tablets, apps will be downloadable through the Apple App Store; for Android devices, use the Google Play Store; and for PCs and Xiobot Intelligent Controllers, apps will be downloadable directly from our website.</p>
<p><b>How are Xiobot devices constructed?  </b></p>
<p>Xiobots are highly miniaturized electronic devices housed in durable ABS plastic cases.  They’ll incorporated state-of-the-art electronics manufactured to the highest quality assurance standards.</p>
<p><b>Are they waterproof?  </b></p>
<p>In general, they are not intended to be waterproof; but specifically, the pool sensor, garden sensor, and leak detector sensors are.  [Note: Wireless connectivity won’t operate if they are fully submerged.]</p>
<p><b>How are they installed?</b></p>
<p>Xiobots will be enclosed in an assortment of case formats.  Input and output controls will have one or more rows of screw terminals (appropriate for wiring external circuits); environment sensors will be housed in tiny lipstick-sized cases with a small grill-like baffle; and so on.  Each case will be a to-the-point, minimalist design adhering to the adage: “form follows function”.  </p>
<p>We’ll provide several mounting alternatives for both ease and reliability of installation. Aesthetics are as important a consideration as functionality.</p>
<p><b>How many Xiobot devices can the system handle?</b></p>
<p>As a design goal, we’re aiming for an unlimited number of devices within the Xiobot domain.  In practical implementation, 128 devices might be the maximum number when wireless connections are made directly between a Xiobot and a smartphone or tablet (and this is a limitation of the smartphone or tablet software architecture).  The number of connections between Xiobots and intelligent controllers will be significantly greater; AND, you can put numerous intelligent controllers in a network (allowing virtually unlimited numbers of Xiobot devices within the domain).</p>
<p><b>How many user devices (smartphones, tablets, or PCs) can access a Xiobot domain simultaneously?</b></p>
<p>If you have a Xiobot Intelligent Controller, any number of user devices can access your Xiobot domain simultaneously!</p>
<p>That’s right.  Any number of user access devices — of any mix — can simultaneously access and control the Xiobot devices in your Xiobot domain.  You can even overlap multiple Xiobot domains and assign different access privileges to each user.  And, one Cloud Service account can make multiple Xiobot domains accessible through a single remote sign-on.</p>
<p><b>What about power failures?</b></p>
<p>Xiobot sensors operate on batteries independently of utility power.  Xiobot Intelligent Controllers (and your network equipment) can operate on a small uninterruptible power supply (i.e., battery back-up).  The Xiobot AC Power Sensor will alert you if a power failure occurs or if your utility-provided line voltage is too low or too high..</p>
<p><b>Can a PC with a USB Interface operate like an intelligent controller?</b></p>
<p>Yes.  Of course, the PC must remain powered-up (just like an intelligent controller would need to be).  </p>
<p>A PC can also operate as a bridge to the Cloud Service; and if your PC is connected to the Internet with a static IP address and can support web services (i.e., act as a web server), you can, in essence, host cloud services from that PC.  This is practical and useful for large-scale or industrial implementation of Xiobots.</p>
<p><b>What about security?</b></p>
<p>Wireless connectivity to Xiobot devices will always be bi-directionally encrypted (by an AES encryption algorithm).  The Xiobot domain will NOT be vulnerable to trespass by external devices.*  The intelligent controllers and our proposed Cloud Service will also be protected by encryption and by device-level,    log-in security.  [AES is the ‘Advanced Encryption Standard’ used by the U.S. government and worldwide.]</p>
<p>* Your local area network (LAN) should be secured following appropriate best practices.</p>
<p><b>Will there be technical support for Xiobots?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely!  We envision providing a diversity of customer-centric support.  (After all, what good is any technology if you can’t use it?)  This will include on-line and dial-up support resources.</p>
<p>Technical support will be based here in the United States.  (English, yes;  Español, sí; Peut-être français.)</p>
<p><b>Will there be an on-line Knowledge Base?</b></p>
<p>Yes.  It would behoove us to make as much information as possible available to users.  We’ll show implementation notes and provide detailed set-up and operating information.  We’d like to showcase user experiences and examples as well.</p>
<p><b>Will a Software Development Kit (SDK) be available for users to write commands directly to Xiobot devices?</b></p>
<p>We are currently thinking along those lines.  Especially with the idea of providing programming ‘hooks’ allowing VBA (Microsoft’s ‘Visual Basic for Applications’) code through MS Office™ or embedded macros in EXCEL® to easily communicate with Xiobots.  (MAC and LINUX users... please be patient.)</p>
<p><b>Will Xiobots be covered by a warranty?  </b></p>
<p>Certainly!  All devices will be factory tested before packaging them for fulfillment.  We will warrant them for a full year.</p>
<p><b>Are we serious about compatibility with other systems?</b></p>
<p>Yes.  For similar Bluetooth 4.0-enabled devices, we’ll have software solutions for compatibility; for other hardware, we might develop system-specific interfaces.</p>
<p>Will there be a ‘suggestion box’ and any incentive for submitting product development ideas?</p>
<p>Okay... submit a significantly useful suggestion (which hasn’t already been submitted), and we’ll send you a $25 gift certificate towards the purchase of any Xiobot products.</p>
<p><b>Can we get more information about the diversity of apps that are going to be available?</b></p>
<p>Some of the first apps to be made available will be noteworthy priorities that any home or building automation system should have — such as: the thermostat app and an alarm system interface app.  There will be apps for the pool, garden and leak detection sensors, an app for monitoring an aquarium, and even an app to remotely operate your garage door opener.</p>
<p>We will strive to make most apps entirely free to download and use — with updates and improvements as they become available.  We will produce premium apps and charge nominal prices for them.</p>
<p><b>Will we manufacture wired Xiobot devices?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we believe that there is a niche for them.  For some sensors, they’ll be much less expensive and just as adaptable to their intended application as wireless sensors would be.</p>
<p><b>Where will Xiobots be manufactured?</b></p>
<p>Xiobots will be proudly manufactured here in the United States — and we’ll always do everything we can to promote that — as both a corporate responsibility and as members of our community.</p>
<p><b>Will manufacturing, the product itself, and its packaging be eco-friendly?</b></p>
<p>Completely.  Manufacturing of all circuitry will be RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) compliant.  </p>
<p>As a manufacturer, we will support environment responsibility in every aspect of the product life-cycle.</p>
<p>Our intended packaging will be eco-friendly as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Are there other Xiobot devices that are not listed as perks?</b></p>
<p>Yes. We'll post additional information about all of our Xiobots on our website as soon as possible...  <a href=""http://www.xiobot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.xiobot.com</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can you share any more information?</b></p>
<p>Our product designs represent a significant investment in effort and are valuable intellectual property. We need to carefully protect that; however, as additional information develops, we’ll share what we can. </p>

There are Xiobot devices to monitor and control
everything in your home or business. 
You could place an environmental sensor anywhere and
you’d instantly be able to monitor the climate in your surroundings. Put a
garden sensor between your flowers and it’ll tell you about the air temperature
in your yard and the moisture content of your soil. Attach a Xiobot control to
your sprinkler system and manage your landscaping better by precisely
regulating your watering.  Connect all of
your Xiobot devices with a Xiobot Intelligent Controller and you’ll be able to
securely monitor and control everything from anywhere across the Internet!

What are Xiobots?


Xiobots are
tiny, durable, wireless devices — each with its own embedded microprocessor and
integrated Bluetooth transceiver — which can operate on a network or the
Internet through a Xiobot Intelligent Controller; or, directly with your
Bluetooth 4.0-enabled smartphone, tablet, or PC.

Measure and control your environment — manage and automate your world.
Are Xiobots expensive?
No. Xiobots will use cutting-edge technologies, components, and manufacturing
methodologies whose costs have been reduced by large-scale production. They
will be a bargain!
How do Xiobots interact with you?
Xiobot sensors can immediately update Bluetooth 4.0-enabled smartphones,
tablets, and PCs (that are within range) with status information; or, operate
and send text and e-mail messages to you through a network or the Internet
using a Xiobot Intelligent Controller.
How ""tiny"" are Xiobots?
The smallest wireless sensors will be about the size of a lipstick case. 
What does wireless connectivity do?
Connecting sensors and devices to a centralized control system is the
proverbial ""last 100 feet"" problem. And that is: how to get all
elements connected at minimal cost in terms of time and material. Wireless
technology makes a distributed control system truly ""plug ’n play"".
What if you are unsure about
Bluetooth 4.0 compatibility? Not a problem... if your
smartphone, tablet, or PC doesn’t have Bluetooth 4.0 compatibility, the Xiobot
system includes intelligent controllers that allow any device with a web
browser to interact with Xiobots. 
What does a ""Xiobot Intelligent
Controller"" do? A controller offers seamless access
to your Xiobots locally (on your Local Area Network) and across the Internet —
providing you with real-time information from your Xiobot devices and giving
you remote connectivity to your Xiobot controls.  Xiobot Intelligent Controllers include a micro-processor
that automatically performs scheduled and programmable functions and executes useful apps.
Control everything with a Xiobot!

What Xiobot devices
will be available?





Xiobots can perform simple functions
like reading temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity — and complex
operations such as connecting to ‘real world’ systems and equipment. They can:
switch low-power electrical signals (controlling heating and air conditioning
systems); switch 110-220 VAC loads (high-power, household electrical lines);
interface with your existing security system or sprinkler controls; or,
replicate IR remote controls when used with our Entertainment System app (which
will give you control of your television and entertainment equipment like
you’ve never had before). And, they can connect to and interact with other home
and building automation systems.


Xiobots are easy to set-up and use;
will typically operate for over a year with a single set of batteries; and,
come with free software applications for your smartphone (iPhone or Android),
tablet, or PC. An intelligent controller allows you to access your Xiobots
across your local network or remotely through the Internet. The intelligent
controller is a microcomputer that stores apps and information; allows your
Xiobots to respond to scripted and scheduled (timer-initiated) commands; and,
to act upon monitored conditions or events (such as detected temperature
changes or a status change in a sensor or detected signal). A cloud service
will be available to extend the capabilities of Xiobots even further.
The Xiobot system is
extensible... we are committed to a product architecture that will evolve to
fulfill future opportunities for both innovative hardware and software.  The devices listed above are just some of the
Xiobot products on our drawing board.

Xiobots
are here to serve you!







Where would you use Xiobots?



Xiobot devices are designed to be versatile and provide reliable installation in diverse settings — whether they’re used in home and building automation or for industrial control.
A typical home can use several Xiobot devices.  The sample floor plan (below) illustrates how wireless Xiobots might be set up to:


manage an HVAC (Heating - Ventilating - Air Conditioning) system using several environment sensors, a contact closure control, and the thermostat app running in an intelligent controller; 


detect alert conditions with signal sensors connected to an alarm panel and smoke detectors, water leak sensors placed under appliances in the utility room, under water heaters, and in the kitchen or basement; and,




control sprinklers and pool or spa water level with relay controls and scripted commands operating in an intelligent controller.


                                                                            



What else can you do with Xiobots?




Accurately monitor the environment (temperature and humidity) of your children’s rooms


Locate temperature sensors in your refrigerator, freezer, attic, basement, storerooms, anywhere


Monitor your wine cellar, humidor, collectibles, art collection, anything


Monitor and control everything inside of a vacation home, rental property, or office


Monitor and activate sump pumps, attic ventilators, or any other essential equipment


Monitor your pool, spa, or Koi pond temperatures — even aquariums — automatically filling water as needed, and predicting dangerously low temperatures or excessively rapid evaporation


Monitor the proximity of your dog or cat


Monitor the operation of equipment throughout your home, building, or industrial facility


Interface with (and control) an entertainment system — allowing you to programmatically ‘channel surf’, perform complex and hard-to-remember sequences of commands, or automatically switch channels and turn your TV on or off throughout the week


Interface with an alarm system to extend, enhance, and personalize its functionality


Predict potential frost or arid conditions in your garden


Be alerted when utility power fails in unoccupied facilities (or at home while you’re asleep)


Be alerted when doors or gates are opened


Use the intelligent controller to automatically respond to monitored conditions or random events


Use the intelligent controller to execute date and time-scheduled or scripted actions




The possibilities are endless!
Xiobots = Great Hardware + Great Software

We understand that you’ll demand hardware that can be installed with apps that can be configured without opening an installation manual.  We know that you’ll want apps that’ll get you the information you need as quickly as possible and give you the control you expect.
We’ll deliver.  We are committed to producing sophisticated devices whose functionality, reliability, and performance are an outstanding value; and, to creating the most efficient and easy-to-use apps possible.  Every app will be intuitively obvious to use and updated automatically as it is improved.  Every device will evolve and exciting new designs will   be forthcoming.  We are devoted to automation technology — it’s who we are!
Take the Environment Sensor device for example.  It operates with an app that lets you scroll through all similar devices within your Xiobot domain.  Once you select the specific sensor that you want to monitor, the app displays the pertinent information with the presentation settings you’ve previously selected.  You’ll see a calibrated temperature reading, relative humidity, and barometric pressure. You’ll see graphical trends showing highs and lows for each parameter over a specified timespan.  On another page, you’ll be able to select high and low warning and alert settings and the optional actions that you want an intelligent controller to take when conditional events occur.
Intelligent controllers will feature easily navigated  interfaces that’ll make condition monitoring, event handling, scheduling, and scripting actions easy to set-up.
We know that “software makes hardware happen”!



Condition monitoring, event handling, scheduling, and scripted actions


What good are electronic sensors if YOU need to monitor them?

If you have a Xiobot Intelligent Controller or a Xiobot PC interface or you use our Cloud Service (which operates through an intelligent controller or PC), your Xiobot domain can be automated!



An intelligent controller provides the processing power to monitor all of your sensors (and all of the different types of sensors) in real time and to respond to conditions and events with scripted actions.  Your Xiobot controller can even interact with other automation systems (extending capabilities even further).


Automation implies that your Xiobot controls will operate devices and equipment which they are connected  to — executing actions determined by a scripted set of commands (directed by conditions being monitored, or triggered through events being detected, by Xiobot sensors); and, that you can have warnings and alerts sent to you (or any number of other recipients) by text message or e-mail.  Automation allows your sensor information to be perpetually logged, reported, or analyzed; and, makes it possible for Xiobot controls to be activated by your pre-scripted commands or by an app.
You’ll use a specific sensor for a particular task; and, when a potentially catastrophic or important event occurs, your Xiobot Intelligent Controller — running an appropriate app — can respond to it automatically and immediately.
For instance, if you need to know when a compressor or pump has started or failed, use a Passive AC Sensor to alert an appropriate automation app or to execute a specific command script.
Utilize aggregate information from multiple environment sensors to optimize and control your heating and air conditioning system with the Xiobot thermostat app. The app will perform a parametric evaluation of the temperature conditions monitored by selected sensors — integrating several other factors (such as time of day, day of the year, room size, outdoor temperature trends, room occupancy, etc.) — and determines when to activate your HVAC system and which dampers to open and close.  The result?  You’ll experience more effective heating and cooling — keeping you much more comfortable while reducing your HVAC costs.
Use a Garden Sensor to sense the watering needs of your garden — then, use an 8-output, high-power relay control to operate up to eight zones of sprinklers.  (Simply use multiple Xiobot controls if you have more than eight zones.)  With our highly-integrated software apps, you can predict watering needs based upon outside air temperature trends and the detailed information from your array of Garden Sensors.
Use the structured, user interface in an intelligent controller to create “IF / THEN” actions to respond to the detailed information monitored from your Xiobots.  You’ll even be able to script complex actions containing multi-step conditional events.
Scheduled actions will enable you to control your Xiobots based on clock time — and, include other time-based functions such as delays, randomly timed events, timed offsets from sunrise and sunset, days of the week, month, or calendar, and much more!
The Xiobot system is all about building a coherent system of devices and software applications tailored to effectively automate your home, building, or industrial process.  


We are devoted to automation — and you will be too when you install your Xiobots!


Characteristic features of Wireless Xiobots

It's all about connectivity
Just as there are countless ways to use Xiobots, there are many methods to connect and control your Xiobot domain.
You can use Xiobot sensors or controls by themselves — operating them directly with your Bluetooth 4.0-enabled iOS or Android smartphone through a free, downloadable, device-specific app.  Simply put the battery into a device to power it; then, run the app to configure it — that’s all there is to it!  You’ll be set-up to monitor a sensor or operate a control in minutes!
And by the way... if your older smartphone or tablet doesn’t have Bluetooth 4.0 compatibility, you can still use a Xiobot Intelligent Controller to connect to your Xiobots. [Read onward and see how!]
An optional USB interface enables your Windows® PC to access a Xiobot domain. Your smartphone will still be able to control your Xiobots directly; and as long as your PC is powered and running the Xiobot controller app, it can execute pre-programmed commands and respond to monitored conditions and events. 
With a PC’s capacity to execute scripted actions, you’ll be well on your way to automating your sensors and creating a fully functional control system for your home or facility.  The Xiobot controller app can also provide bi-directional access to Xiobots across the Internet.
For the ultimate integration experience, you’ll be able to access Xiobots from your local area network with either a wireless (Wi-Fi) or cabled (Ethernet) intelligent controller. The intelligent controller will store pre-programmed commands and respond with scripted actions independently of your PC; and, it can act as a bridge that lets your Xiobots operate across the Internet as well. 
If necessary, you’ll be able to overcome any wireless range limitations (inherent in Bluetooth technology) by setting-up multiple intelligent controllers; so, your Xiobot domain can extend as far as your imagination will permit.
Look at these typical configurations to determine which is best for you:


Basic connectivity allows you to interact with your Xiobots with minimal infrastructure. Your smartphone or tablet (with Bluetooth 4.0) can use its native Bluetooth connectivity to link directly to a Xiobot.


IP connectivity (over an Ethernet or Wi-Fi LAN) allows your Xiobots to be accessible through the Internet — either communicating with you via a remote user interface or connected to our basic Cloud Service.  (The cloud service makes it possible for your Xiobots to be addressable through the Internet even if the broadband connection at the location where your Xiobots are physically located is only serviced by a dynamic IP address.)
The intelligent controller will routinely monitor your Xiobots and can respond instantaneously with scripted command responses (based upon conditions and sensor events) as necessary.  Additionally, scripted commands can automate scheduled (based upon time of day, day of week, day of month, calendar date, etc.) and recurring actions of Xiobot controls.
For example, visualize a pool sensor sending water level information to the controller that commands the device which activates the pool’s water fill valve; or, imagine multiple environmental sensors furnishing information to the controls that operate an HVAC system and open or close selected vents and dampers or operate fans to most efficiently and comfortably manage the environment of your home or building.
Alert events and monitored conditions can even trigger an intelligent controller to send you text or e-mail messages; so, you’ll know exactly what you need to know about your Xiobot domain as soon as possible.  And if you have installed an intelligent controller, your PC won’t need to be powered on — because the intelligent controller is a fully-functional, standalone processor!

In a large Xiobot installation, multiple intelligent controllers (with IP connectivity through either Ethernet or  Wi-Fi) can be connected to the same local area network — forming a signal backbone that will effectively expand the range of your Bluetooth link and extend coverage among physically dispersed devices.  The size of your Xiobot installation could be virtually unlimited!
How do the pieces fit together?
The Xiobot system is all about building a coherent system of devices with controller interfaces tailored for ease of installation and use. The following diagram abstracts the relationship between these components and depicts the connections between them: 



What can our Cloud Service do for you?

Our Cloud Service can automatically monitor your sensors and will execute alert scripts according to your specifications (using an intuitive and interactive web page interface to define event conditions to act upon and scripted actions to perform).
You’ll be able to read the status of your Xiobots and send them commands — and, you’ll be able to look at recorded status information to see what data has been received from your sensors and what commands have been executed.
Our Cloud Service will be provided at NO CHARGE for two years to our charter contributors — and will be inexpensively priced thereafter.  [Details pertaining to our Cloud Service and this offer will be available soon after the conclusion of our campaign. This offer is subject to change without prior notice.]
FAQs and additional information about our Development Roadmap
Who are we? 
We are a small team of engineers seeking to launch a product.  Our background encompasses decades of system design and electronics engineering — producing aerospace, scientific, and commercial information technology solutions — and (literally) several lifetimes of extensive and diverse software development experience.
What makes Xiobots a viable solution?
We’re taking a proven architecture from a wired modality to wireless.
Connecting sensors to a controller or data recorder is the proverbial “last 100 feet” problem —that is: how to get devices connected?  Do you spend countless hours stringing cabling through walls, within ceilings, around difficult to reach areas; or, do you rely upon wireless technology to solve that problem for you?  The answer is obvious — and that’s why we’ve engineered Bluetooth connectivity into our Xiobot design.
What are our differentiators?
Features, design, quality of construction, the scope of our solution. We are intent upon bringing you cutting-edge technology and proving that “high-tech” does not need to be high cost.
What are our product development plans?
The Xiobot system is EXTENSIBLE — and we intend to produce new devices as opportunities arise.  We have several devices already designed that we did not enumerate in the offerings of this campaign.
Is automation complex?
We looked at automation as a systemic function and understood that ease of implementation begins with comprehensive product engineering from the outset.  We started with a product concept that was rock solid from the ground up and built low-cost, wired Xiobot device prototypes.  We designed sensors, controls, and controllers with the sort of software and hardware integration that could effectively deliver  an elegant solution. Then, we added wireless Bluetooth connectivity to our design to simplify installation..  
Xiobots can take time-consuming and distracting tasks and reliably automate them — resulting in greater convenience, accuracy, and safety for you.
Are there any risks or challenges?
None.  We are using a circuit design [from the Bluetooth chip manufacturer] that has previously passed F.C.C. compliance testing and is already approved for our product.
We are members of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) and have developed our products in compliance with their standards, guidelines, and best practices.
How will we use the funds derived from this campaign?
There is equipment to purchase, fabrication processes to contract, and tooling required to take our design into production; and, we’ll need additional development resources to accomplish remaining engineering tasks.  Naturally, components, sub-assemblies, fixtures, and other elements of the manufacturing process will be needed as well.
We will create jobs... specifically: manufacturing engineers, production personnel, customer service people, and marketing and sales specialists.  [NB: We are not promoting a bloated and over-stated campaign!  We strongly believe in the viability and potential commercial success of the Xiobot product and feel that once this product is launched, we will have considerable momentum to carry it to the next level.]
What are the major steps remaining to get into production?
We will finalize our product engineering and concentrate on manufacturing processes. 
We will set-up the production equipment, get people trained to use it, and begin the process of tooling-up for each of the product assembly and fulfillment steps.
We will complete develop the user interface of our prototype software — creating the polished apps that you will use.  
We will design,  implement, and qualify our proposed Cloud Service.  
We will test (and test and test again) our products to guarantee that they will meet the highest standards of performance and quality.
We are confident that we can accomplish these tasks within two to three months from the conclusion of a successful campaign.
What is our business plan?
We will sell Xiobot devices directly through a web portal.  We’ll make plans for more extensive distribution — including opportunities for third-party installers and servicers.
We intend to energetically promote the Xiobot product to insure its broad adoption.
Will Xiobots be available through resellers and distributors?
Yes.  If you are a reseller or distributor and Xiobots are of interest to you, please contact us.
What other incentives are there for contributing to this campaign?
Aside from the tangible satisfaction that you’ll receive in the knowledge that you will directly help create jobs and bring economic opportunity to others; you will also receive attractive, reliable, practical, cutting-edge technology at an attractive introductory price.
In addition, you will receive a 10% discount for all future purchases of Xiobot products.
What if your smartphone, tablet, or PC isn’t Bluetooth 4.0-enabled?
Not a problem!  If you have a Xiobot Intelligent Controller, it will allow any user device with a web browser to access your Xiobot domain through your device’s wireless or Ethernet connectivity.  
How big will these devices be?
The designs of plastic cases for each of the Xiobot devices haven’t been finalized; but, we can definitely tell you that they’ll be small — for example, about 1/2” by 3/8” by 2” (about the size of a lipstick case) for the environment sensor and similarly small for most of the other sensors.
Are batteries included?
Yes... and, Xiobots will incorporate circuitry that will maximize battery longevity.  We expect batteries to perform well under normal conditions and have based our estimates accordingly.  Still, we’ll want to know exactly how well; so for each device purchased, you’ll receive the first replacement battery(ies) absolutely free (including shipping and handling) when you fill-out a short, on-line, product performance survey.
What about wireless performance?
Xiobots use low-energy Bluetooth technology and are subject to the constraints and physics of radio frequency (RF) communication.  We believe that performance for distance should reach roughly 100 feet (30 meters).  Unless you are locating devices behind extremely dense materials (concrete, steel, trees, waterfalls, etc.) or have an exceptionally ‘noisy’ RF environment, wireless performance should be good.  (Note: We designed the intelligent controller system to accommodate the possible need for RF ‘repeaters’ throughout a Xiobot domain as a solution for limited or marginal RF performance situations).
Where will Xiobot apps be available?  
Apps will be freely downloadable depending upon the specific target device.  For iOS smartphones and tablets, apps will be downloadable through the Apple App Store; for Android devices, use the Google Play Store; and for PCs and Xiobot Intelligent Controllers, apps will be downloadable directly from our website.
How are Xiobot devices constructed?  
Xiobots are highly miniaturized electronic devices housed in durable ABS plastic cases.  They’ll incorporated state-of-the-art electronics manufactured to the highest quality assurance standards.
Are they waterproof?  
In general, they are not intended to be waterproof; but specifically, the pool sensor, garden sensor, and leak detector sensors are.  [Note: Wireless connectivity won’t operate if they are fully submerged.]
How are they installed?
Xiobots will be enclosed in an assortment of case formats.  Input and output controls will have one or more rows of screw terminals (appropriate for wiring external circuits); environment sensors will be housed in tiny lipstick-sized cases with a small grill-like baffle; and so on.  Each case will be a to-the-point, minimalist design adhering to the adage: “form follows function”.  
We’ll provide several mounting alternatives for both ease and reliability of installation. Aesthetics are as important a consideration as functionality.
How many Xiobot devices can the system handle?
As a design goal, we’re aiming for an unlimited number of devices within the Xiobot domain.  In practical implementation, 128 devices might be the maximum number when wireless connections are made directly between a Xiobot and a smartphone or tablet (and this is a limitation of the smartphone or tablet software architecture).  The number of connections between Xiobots and intelligent controllers will be significantly greater; AND, you can put numerous intelligent controllers in a network (allowing virtually unlimited numbers of Xiobot devices within the domain).
How many user devices (smartphones, tablets, or PCs) can access a Xiobot domain simultaneously?
If you have a Xiobot Intelligent Controller, any number of user devices can access your Xiobot domain simultaneously!
That’s right.  Any number of user access devices — of any mix — can simultaneously access and control the Xiobot devices in your Xiobot domain.  You can even overlap multiple Xiobot domains and assign different access privileges to each user.  And, one Cloud Service account can make multiple Xiobot domains accessible through a single remote sign-on.
What about power failures?
Xiobot sensors operate on batteries independently of utility power.  Xiobot Intelligent Controllers (and your network equipment) can operate on a small uninterruptible power supply (i.e., battery back-up).  The Xiobot AC Power Sensor will alert you if a power failure occurs or if your utility-provided line voltage is too low or too high..
Can a PC with a USB Interface operate like an intelligent controller?
Yes.  Of course, the PC must remain powered-up (just like an intelligent controller would need to be).  
A PC can also operate as a bridge to the Cloud Service; and if your PC is connected to the Internet with a static IP address and can support web services (i.e., act as a web server), you can, in essence, host cloud services from that PC.  This is practical and useful for large-scale or industrial implementation of Xiobots.
What about security?
Wireless connectivity to Xiobot devices will always be bi-directionally encrypted (by an AES encryption algorithm).  The Xiobot domain will NOT be vulnerable to trespass by external devices.*  The intelligent controllers and our proposed Cloud Service will also be protected by encryption and by device-level,    log-in security.  [AES is the ‘Advanced Encryption Standard’ used by the U.S. government and worldwide.]
* Your local area network (LAN) should be secured following appropriate best practices.
Will there be technical support for Xiobots?
Absolutely!  We envision providing a diversity of customer-centric support.  (After all, what good is any technology if you can’t use it?)  This will include on-line and dial-up support resources.
Technical support will be based here in the United States.  (English, yes;  Español, sí; Peut-être français.)
Will there be an on-line Knowledge Base?
Yes.  It would behoove us to make as much information as possible available to users.  We’ll show implementation notes and provide detailed set-up and operating information.  We’d like to showcase user experiences and examples as well.
Will a Software Development Kit (SDK) be available for users to write commands directly to Xiobot devices?
We are currently thinking along those lines.  Especially with the idea of providing programming ‘hooks’ allowing VBA (Microsoft’s ‘Visual Basic for Applications’) code through MS Office™ or embedded macros in EXCEL® to easily communicate with Xiobots.  (MAC and LINUX users... please be patient.)
Will Xiobots be covered by a warranty?  
Certainly!  All devices will be factory tested before packaging them for fulfillment.  We will warrant them for a full year.
Are we serious about compatibility with other systems?
Yes.  For similar Bluetooth 4.0-enabled devices, we’ll have software solutions for compatibility; for other hardware, we might develop system-specific interfaces.
Will there be a ‘suggestion box’ and any incentive for submitting product development ideas?
Okay... submit a significantly useful suggestion (which hasn’t already been submitted), and we’ll send you a $25 gift certificate towards the purchase of any Xiobot products.
Can we get more information about the diversity of apps that are going to be available?
Some of the first apps to be made available will be noteworthy priorities that any home or building automation system should have — such as: the thermostat app and an alarm system interface app.  There will be apps for the pool, garden and leak detection sensors, an app for monitoring an aquarium, and even an app to remotely operate your garage door opener.
We will strive to make most apps entirely free to download and use — with updates and improvements as they become available.  We will produce premium apps and charge nominal prices for them.
Will we manufacture wired Xiobot devices?
Yes, we believe that there is a niche for them.  For some sensors, they’ll be much less expensive and just as adaptable to their intended application as wireless sensors would be.
Where will Xiobots be manufactured?
Xiobots will be proudly manufactured here in the United States — and we’ll always do everything we can to promote that — as both a corporate responsibility and as members of our community.
Will manufacturing, the product itself, and its packaging be eco-friendly?
Completely.  Manufacturing of all circuitry will be RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) compliant.  
As a manufacturer, we will support environment responsibility in every aspect of the product life-cycle.
Our intended packaging will be eco-friendly as well.

Are there other Xiobot devices that are not listed as perks?
Yes. We'll post additional information about all of our Xiobots on our website as soon as possible...  http://www.xiobot.com

Can you share any more information?
Our product designs represent a significant investment in effort and are valuable intellectual property. We need to carefully protect that; however, as additional information develops, we’ll share what we can.

We feel that the risks associated with this project are very minimal and fairly low. We've already gone through the build process with our current prototype. The main challenge we see would be we receive more orders than anticipated which may delay the final delivery. Just in case, we have allotted extra time in the project timeline to allow for this. 
If any other challenges come up, we promise to be transparent and communicate with our backers immediately. We will try our best to complete this project.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

 Use #nfcwalletcard and share you experience with others! The projectWe have developed the NFC wallet card for one simple reason. To help people to easily and securely store their valuable secret data. Smart protection for your most important secret dataOur mission is to provide a secure and easy-to-use solution for sensitive data protection. We all have important passwords, codes and other kind of secret data, but most people do not know how to protect these properly. Fortunately you can use the new NFC wallet card to securely store your valuable information easily.Protect your most important data with this new smart technology! Protection for important secret dataNFC wallet card is an innovative way to protect your important secret data, it is a very secure offline data storage for sensitive secret codes.This product is designed to be a very secure cold storage hardware for cryptocurrencies, passwords and sensitive data, but you can use it to securely store any kind of secret text you want to protect.NFC wallet card is a truly offline hardware, which is a huge advantage for security reasons.As a passive device, the chip simply does not have the ability to interact with it's environment, so you can be sure, you have full control over the hardware.Use the free mobile application to access all features and security levels! Free shippingShipping fees can be a problem for the most crowdfunding projects, but fortunately we have a logistic partner, and we can offer you free shipping worldwide!Cards will be sent as International Primary Business Letter, which is one of the fastest options available.Every card comes with a FREE black RFID blocking sleeve, which protects your card by blocking radio signals, so the card in the sleeve can not be accessed by NFC readers/writers around. Powered by NFC technologyData connection with a single easy moveNFC stands for Near Field Communication, which is a subset of RFID. NFC is a radio frequency based technology, which allows communication between devices in a short range.Near Field Communication provides easy data connection over the air, without the need of any cables or ports.Our cards are equipped with the highest quality NFC chips to benefit from the advantages of this contactless technology.Easy usage with modern smartphonesModern smartphones have an integrated NFC module on their backside, which can be used to interact with our cards. Due to the contactless technology, you only need to hold the card near to this module to access it.Using this awesome technology, you can store your data on an NFC chip without the need of any active power supply.Cards are open by default and work with any NFC software or mobile application you like.You can also use our mobile application to access additional features and security levels! Exclusive and modern product designAll of our cards have the same dimensions, they are 55 mm wide and 85 mm tall, like most of the plastic cards you already have, so they can perfectly fit into any card holders and regular wallets.We developed a super sleek, extra lightweight design, the cards are 0.4 mm thin, and their weight is only 1.85 grams.We are a green company, so we decided to make a product which is as environmental friendly as possible.Our cards have a six-layer design and contain only 0.2725 grams of plastic. This means 94.7% less plastic consumption compared to regular plastic cards.The NFC chip itself is fully covered by an acrylic coat, so the most important part of the card is totally waterproof. Cold storage wallet for cryptocurrenciesOur innovationMost hardware wallets for cryptocurrencies are micro computers, with all the disadvantages like
the need of a power source,
the risk of failure of single components,
potential hardware and software vulnerabilities,
non-transparent operation
and so on...
But we recognized the fact, that this kind of complexity comes with too much unneeded risks and unnecessary attack vectors.So instead of creating another complex hardware, we focus on utilizing the features of the mobile device we all have already.This leads to a more stable and transparent operation, while being much more cost effective! Secure cold storage protectionThe most important goal we achieved during the development of our product is the outstanding security it has.The NFC hardware we have integrated to the wallet card always remains offline, so the biggest security issue is solved by the architecture itself.Cards are open by default, so you can use them out-of-the-box with any NFC software and mobile application you like.Using our free application you have access to all additional security features, which give you an easy-to-use toolset to manage your cards. In the app you can choose from multiple security levels suitable for your needs.Due to these security levels, your cards will be protected even if others are able to physically access them. Outstanding compatibilityThe NFC wallet card natively supports any kind of cryptocurrencies, which are based on a private key or a secret code.Yes you read it right. Any! Even those that not exist yet. NFC wallet card is a solution to securely store any kind of secret text data, which makes is very useful to protect your private key.Check the technical overview for more info! Secure protection for cryptocurrenciesThis product is an NFC vault with secure data encryption.You can use the wallet card to securely store your private key, but it is also suitable for redeemable cryptocurrency codes as well.We developed a rock solid solution to protect the interest of crypto holders and investors.NFC wallet card is a perfect way to create an encrypted offline backup of your private key! Protected offline password containerThe problem we solvedWe all have accounts protected by passwords. If you care about information security, you must already know that strong passwords are long and really hard to remember, because they contain a lot of random characters.Saving passwords to the browser's storage is not a secure way to store them, because if somebody can access your computer, your passwords can be stolen easily.Password managers are usually running on a computer with internet connection, and some of these softwares even synchronize data over their cloud service, which is a potential security problem, because they are direct targets of hackers.You should never share your passwords with any kind of third party anyway!Writing passwords to a paper seems to be a good option, but you still have the risk that somebody will access and read them. Protection for important passwordsOur wallet cards can be used to securely store your most important passwords offline.Because of the passive NFC architecture and our strict application policy, you can securely store and view your passwords, while being offline.If you have an account you can not afford to loose, use our wallet card, and secure your password as soon as you can!You can use our free application to encrypt and save your password to the wallet card. The application runs offline, and never ever access the internet.The app comes with multiple kind of security levels, so you can be sure that your passwords are safe, even if others can physically access your wallet cards. Ultimate protection for sensitive dataSensitive data need to be protectedPeople have a lot of pieces of codes, which need to be protected and have to be kept in secret.There are PIN and PUK codes, bank authentication data and answers for security questions.It's really hard to remember all kind of these sensitive data, but you should never store any on your computer or written down to a piece of paper.Service providers like banks always warn you not to write these codes on a paper, but remember them. But we all know that it is really hard to remember all one-by-one. Protection for your sensitive dataOur wallet cards can be used to easily secure sensitive data. The only way to keep data secure is to encrypt and store it offline.This is the reason why we developed the NFC wallet card, which is a perfect way to securely store your important data.With our free and easy-to-use application you can choose from multiple kind of security levels, so you can be sure that your data is protected securely, even if others can physically access the cards you used. Additional level of security using the key cardKey card is a hardware keyYou can choose from multiple security levels when using our application. Most of these security levels apply data encryption before storing your secret on the wallet card.You can use the key card to encrypt your data without remembering the encryption password.Key cards are empty by default, you can fill them with newly generated encryption key data using our application. Key card as a 2FA hardwareTwo-factor-authentication is a proven way to improve the security of your protected data. This technique is widely used by the biggest IT companies for a reason.Literally the 2FA key is a super strong encryption password you don't need to remember, because it is stored on the hardware itself.You can have the key card as a 2FA hardware using security level three.This way attackers will not be able to get their hands on your data even if they know your encryption password. How to use it for security purposesWhen you create your wallet card using our free app you can choose to have a key card added to the setup.Due to the multiple type of security levels we provide, you can utilize the benefits of this additional protection easily.You can protect unlimited number of wallet cards with a single key card, which makes your life much easier. Free and easy-to-use mobile applicationAdvanced features of our applicationOur cards are open by default and work out-of-the-box with any NFC software and mobile application you like. The NFC chip comes preformatted to NDEF to ensure compatibility with smartphones.However our mobile application contains additional features to make the usage of your cards more secure and easy. Strict access policyThe application will only ask for the most essential access rights, and will have no access to any resource which is not really needed. It will never scan your contact, messages, media files, etc...For security reasons, our application is totally separated from the internet. The app will never reach or call any servers, and will never connect to the internet.When you finish interacting with your cards, always use the ""safe exit"" button to shut down the app! This feature will wipe all previously used memory blocks, to completely remove any trace of your private data you entered. Development progressCurrently we are working hard to finish the development of the Android application, which is supposed to be publicly available soon.Our application will always have a free version which will work with all the cards we offer.As a new startup, we really could use any help to raise funds for the application development. If you like our project and you can afford, please donate some crypto or buy your cards at our crowdfunding page at Indiegogo to support our progress! Advance features of our mobile applicationYou can use all the additional security features with our free and easy-to-use application. Creating a new wallet cardYou can save your data to a new and empty wallet card using this feature. Creation of a new wallet card is just three easy steps:
You enter the data you want to store securely. This can be any kind of important secret text you want to protect. Check the technical overview for more info!
Select one of the security levels, and enter the details required by the chosen level.
Place the wallet card to the back of your mobile device to write the data to it.
 Creating a new key cardThis feature helps you to create a new key card by generating a very secure random encryption key and saving it to the key card.Creation of a new key card is also very easy:
Select a security level you want to apply to the key card.
Enter the details required by the chosen security level.
Place the card to the back of your device and it will write the newly generated data to the key card.
 Opening a wallet cardYou can view the data stored on the wallet card by opening it. Opening a wallet card is really easy:
Scan the wallet card you want to open.
Enter the credentials required by the security level you used to create the wallet.
After you opened the wallet card successfully, you will be able to make modifications and save the edited data to the card. Making a cloneYou have the option to easily create backups of any cards you have. Of course this feature works for wallet and key cards too.You only need to scan the card you want to clone, then use the other card to save a copy.Clones will require the same credentials as the card you cloned. Making cards readonlyIn some cases it is very important to write protect your wallet or key cards to prevent overwrites.This way nobody will be able to delete or overwrite data on your wallet card. Keep in mind that making a card readonly is a permanent operation and can not be undone. Wiping dataWhen you don't need the data on the card anymore, you can clean it by wiping it's memory.This operation will safely remove the data from the chip by overwriting all bytes on the card before emptying it to remove traces of previously stored data. Security checklistIt is always a good practice to going through the security checklist before interacting with cards to protect yourself against unseen threats.This checklist will suggest you some quick tasks like turning off networking, bluetooth, entering airplane mode and rebooting your device. Safe exitAlways use the safe exit command to shut down the application!This feature will explicitly overwrite and clean the memory which was used by the app to remove traces of data you entered during the last session. Security LevelsSecurity levels are protecting your wallet and key cards, even if others are able to physically access them.Security levels for encrypted protectionSecurity levels are additional features, available exclusively in the free mobile application we develop.Levels above zero can be used to encrypt your data before saving it to the card. This way the secret data will be protected even if others are able to access your card.You can read detailed info about security levels here Project statusWe have been developed a working product, we have supplier contracts and a logistic partner.

<br/><b>Current Status: </b>We at BrainyDeep have been keenly listening to the feedback we have received. We have peeled the Kraken design back to see what is essential and what isn't. We have also sought international sourcing options and requoted for every part on the Kraken. We are currently awaiting sample parts for many of these and hope to release the Kraken 2.0 at a significantly reduced price point. Stay in touch by visiting our website <a href=""http://www.brainydeeep.com!"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.brainydeep.com!</a><br/>Thanks for the attention throughout the campaign!<br/><br/> The Kraken is a revolution in extruder technology for filament based 3D Printing applications. The Kraken’s unique mechanism is the key to enabling the incredible performance and flexibility offered by the Kraken. In fact, we are confident that our extruder is the best extruder available in the world, even in many thousand dollar commercial machines.<br/><br/><p>The mechanism used by the Kraken enables all of the following features, regardless of configuration:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unique Mechanism with Huge Gear Ratio (20:1)</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Extrusion rate control</strong> – The gearing means each motor step is now smaller than ever before, giving better control of filament deposition rates! We’ve tested down to 0.02mm layers at 30mm/s!! (0.36mm^3/s) <br/>
</li>
</ul></span></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></p></span></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/17187/files/20130817043904-AMI_7144.jpg?1376739544"" src="""" style=""width: 420.642px; height: 236px;""/></p></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><ul>
<li>
<strong>Smaller Lighter Motors</strong> – Using NEMA 11 motors, only 28mm square, only 140g and only 0.6 amps each!</li>
<li>
<strong>Small Size – 41.2mm wide, ~90mm tall – </strong>Print larger than you thought possible on your current chassis!<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Increasing Tangential Force </strong>– Filament force increases with increasing speed, for perfect printing across the widest range of printing conditions. Over 300:1 ratio between the fastest and slowest tested extrusion rates!</li>
<li>
<strong>Step Loss, not Filament Strip</strong> – Step loss rather than stripping the filament – step loss will recover, stripped filaments will not - the difference is a minor blemish instead of an aborted print.</li>
<li>
<strong>Suits all filament sizes</strong> – Using different filament sizes is as easy as just swapping your J head!</li>
<li>
<strong>Metal design</strong> – Machined chassis is compatible with any high temperature hot end designs with a J head mount. <b>Use higher temperatures for exotic printing materials such as Nylon, Polycarbonate and more!</b>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Printable Mounts</strong> – Maximum compatibility with printers on the market. Currently we have developed and tested mounts for a Prusa Mendel, but we will release the mounting layout for development of all types of mounts, including for mounting accessories (fans, cameras, etc)</li>
<li>
<strong>Bowden Compatible</strong> – Can easily be adapted to use as a Bowden extruder.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>In addition, the Kraken is 2 extruders in 1!</h2>
<h3><strong>Dual Pinch Wheel Configuration</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/17168/files/20130817042001-DSC_2690.jpg?1376738401"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>In dual pinch wheel mode, both motors on the Kraken are used to drive a single filament, one from each side. This means greater grip on the filament than could ever be achieved before, all but eliminating any chance of stripped out filament and increasing the extrusion force which can be achieved. And what benefits come with high reliability high force extrusion?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Print faster</strong> - 900mm/s+ extrusion speeds!!  No longer is the extruder the bottleneck for high speed printing. (&gt;100mm^3/s)<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Print reliably</strong> – Filament slip is a problem of the past!</li>
<li>
<strong>Print cooler</strong> – High force extrusion means you can print at lower temperatures for faster material setting times and less heat left in the print, perfect for printing without a fan and ooze free prints.</li>
<li><p>Plus all of the Kraken's regular benefits above.<br/></p></li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/17194/files/20130817045329-DSC_2360.jpg?1376740409"" src="""" style=""width: 289.429px; height: 432px;""/></p> 
<h3><strong>Dual Nozzle Configuration</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/17170/files/20130817042034-DSC_2695.jpg?1376738434"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>In dual nozzle configuration, each motor drives a single nozzle similar to traditional extruders, but with all of the benefits of the Kraken’s unique mechanism!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>M-M-MAXIMUM nozzles</strong> – Squeeze more nozzles onto your printer than ever before! 2 Nozzles with a total width of 41.2mm means you can have 4 nozzles in less than the size of 1 Wade’s Geared extruder!!</li>
<li>
<strong>Print Larger</strong> – The nozzles themselves are located closer to each other than ever before. This means each nozzle can reach more of the build area, reducing loss of build size when using multiple nozzles! Print up to 26x20cm with 1 nozzle, 23x20cm with 2 nozzles and up to 15x20cm with 4 nozzles on a standard build Prusa Mendel!!</li>
<li>Plus all of the benefits of the Kraken's mechanism as listed above!</li>

<p>The Kraken uses a unique mechanism unlike what has been used in extruders previously. Watch the video to find out more!<br/></p>

Currently we have developed complete mounts for reprap Prusa Mendels, and all printers that use the same mounting (2x 8mm rods 50mm apart). The Kraken also has plenty of mounting holes to adapt it to other printers on the market.<br/><p>Dual pinch wheel mode will work on all printers and boards, provided the current can be adjusted. This is because both motors can be run off a single controller, so even single nozzle electronics will work! <br/></p>
<p>Using more than a single nozzle obviously requires electronics and firmware which supports this, requiring additional stepper driver and hot end connections. The Kraken has been successfully tested with unmodified Gen6 and RAMPS electronics and existing firmware for both dual pinch wheel and dual nozzle printing (RAMPS only, Gen6 only supports dual pinch wheel mode).<br/></p>
<p>We are aiming to providing a basic connection kit, including looms for the motors. This will be targeted at RAMPS and equivalent connections. </p>

The World's Smallest Dual Nozzle Extruder (in all the dimensions which matter)...
One and the same - The Kraken.

Current Status: We at BrainyDeep have been keenly listening to the feedback we have received. We have peeled the Kraken design back to see what is essential and what isn't. We have also sought international sourcing options and requoted for every part on the Kraken. We are currently awaiting sample parts for many of these and hope to release the Kraken 2.0 at a significantly reduced price point. Stay in touch by visiting our website www.brainydeep.com!Thanks for the attention throughout the campaign! The Kraken is a revolution in extruder technology for filament based 3D Printing applications. The Kraken’s unique mechanism is the key to enabling the incredible performance and flexibility offered by the Kraken. In fact, we are confident that our extruder is the best extruder available in the world, even in many thousand dollar commercial machines.The mechanism used by the Kraken enables all of the following features, regardless of configuration:

Unique Mechanism with Huge Gear Ratio (20:1)

Extrusion rate control – The gearing means each motor step is now smaller than ever before, giving better control of filament deposition rates! We’ve tested down to 0.02mm layers at 30mm/s!! (0.36mm^3/s) 




Smaller Lighter Motors – Using NEMA 11 motors, only 28mm square, only 140g and only 0.6 amps each!

Small Size – 41.2mm wide, ~90mm tall – Print larger than you thought possible on your current chassis!


Increasing Tangential Force – Filament force increases with increasing speed, for perfect printing across the widest range of printing conditions. Over 300:1 ratio between the fastest and slowest tested extrusion rates!

Step Loss, not Filament Strip – Step loss rather than stripping the filament – step loss will recover, stripped filaments will not - the difference is a minor blemish instead of an aborted print.

Suits all filament sizes – Using different filament sizes is as easy as just swapping your J head!

Metal design – Machined chassis is compatible with any high temperature hot end designs with a J head mount. Use higher temperatures for exotic printing materials such as Nylon, Polycarbonate and more!


Printable Mounts – Maximum compatibility with printers on the market. Currently we have developed and tested mounts for a Prusa Mendel, but we will release the mounting layout for development of all types of mounts, including for mounting accessories (fans, cameras, etc)

Bowden Compatible – Can easily be adapted to use as a Bowden extruder.

 
In addition, the Kraken is 2 extruders in 1!
Dual Pinch Wheel Configuration

In dual pinch wheel mode, both motors on the Kraken are used to drive a single filament, one from each side. This means greater grip on the filament than could ever be achieved before, all but eliminating any chance of stripped out filament and increasing the extrusion force which can be achieved. And what benefits come with high reliability high force extrusion?


Print faster - 900mm/s+ extrusion speeds!!  No longer is the extruder the bottleneck for high speed printing. (>100mm^3/s)


Print reliably – Filament slip is a problem of the past!

Print cooler – High force extrusion means you can print at lower temperatures for faster material setting times and less heat left in the print, perfect for printing without a fan and ooze free prints.
Plus all of the Kraken's regular benefits above.


 
Dual Nozzle Configuration

In dual nozzle configuration, each motor drives a single nozzle similar to traditional extruders, but with all of the benefits of the Kraken’s unique mechanism!


M-M-MAXIMUM nozzles – Squeeze more nozzles onto your printer than ever before! 2 Nozzles with a total width of 41.2mm means you can have 4 nozzles in less than the size of 1 Wade’s Geared extruder!!

Print Larger – The nozzles themselves are located closer to each other than ever before. This means each nozzle can reach more of the build area, reducing loss of build size when using multiple nozzles! Print up to 26x20cm with 1 nozzle, 23x20cm with 2 nozzles and up to 15x20cm with 4 nozzles on a standard build Prusa Mendel!!
Plus all of the benefits of the Kraken's mechanism as listed above!
I've had some questions about the quality of this print - we're still dialling in the tool change G codes - this print was done without temperature changes or a fan on the old nozzle, causing a bit of leaking. Hope to update this as soon as we get a chance!How does it work?
The Kraken uses a unique mechanism unlike what has been used in extruders previously. Watch the video to find out more!

Compatibility

The Kraken is designed to ease integration into as many existing printers as possible. Currently we have developed complete mounts for reprap Prusa Mendels, and all printers that use the same mounting (2x 8mm rods 50mm apart). The Kraken also has plenty of mounting holes to adapt it to other printers on the market.Dual pinch wheel mode will work on all printers and boards, provided the current can be adjusted. This is because both motors can be run off a single controller, so even single nozzle electronics will work! 
Using more than a single nozzle obviously requires electronics and firmware which supports this, requiring additional stepper driver and hot end connections. The Kraken has been successfully tested with unmodified Gen6 and RAMPS electronics and existing firmware for both dual pinch wheel and dual nozzle printing (RAMPS only, Gen6 only supports dual pinch wheel mode).
We are aiming to providing a basic connection kit, including looms for the motors. This will be targeted at RAMPS and equivalent connections. 
See update 2 for more mounting options!
What is the delivery schedule?
The major project activities and durations are as follows:

Funding period - 6 weeks
Supplier Qualification and Beta Builds - 8 weeks
Beta Build Test Phase - 2 weeks
Full Scale Ordering - 8 weeks
Assembly - 2 weeks
Delivery Timeframe - 2 weeks

Based on this rough timeline, everyone should have their Krakens in March 2014. 
We are committed to this timeline, and have set it accordingly so that we are not one of those typical crowdfunding projects that promises the world yet delivers a year late. This is the primary reason for finishing all R&D work before seeking funding.
Risks and challenges

The Kraken itself has gone through many design iterations and months 
of testing to get to this point. The main risk lies in the scale up 
phase, as we transition designs from our prototype suppliers to larger scale manufacturers. For this reason we are conducting a supplier 
qualification phase (with short test period) to ensure that the design 
transfer has been successful. Parts received during the qualification 
test will be inspected and built up for testing before full scale 
ordering begins to minimize risk of receiving incorrect batches or materials which aren't up to spec.

</div></div>","The world’s most elegant wall-mounted wireless charger that declutters your house and keeps you organized. WallJax is a wireless cell phone charger based on the Qi wireless power standard. WallJax solves the problem of looking for chargers, searching for misplaced phones, and constantly losing your keys. It also eliminates unsightly, tangled cords and counter clutter. Two versions to fit every location and lifestyle.Plug-and-play simplicityWallJax EZ plugs directly into an existing 120-Volt outlet, and does not require screws or any installation at all. WallJax EZ has overwhelming simplicity, but must go where an outlet already exists. It has a USB port, on the bottom, for versatility and passes through 2 regular AC outlets, so you can still use both plugs for anything you’d like!

Wireless Power = 5W (1 Amp, 5 Volt) by Qi standard (WPC 1.1)


Charging Distance = 1/8 inch. *Phone must sit flat on WallJax EZ.


USB Power Output = 10W (2 Amp, 5 Volt) from female USB-A receptacle


Pass Through Outlets = 2 of NEMA type 15-5, 120 Volts AC, 15 Amps


Safety Certification = UL 60950-1 and UL 498A






WallJax Float is a wall-mounted wireless charging shelf that you can put wherever you’d like with the supplied non-mark adhesive (recommended) or screws. Essentially, WallJax Float is the top, shelf part of the WallJax EZ. A standard USB power supply “Wall Wart” (like the ones that come with phones) provides power over a USB cable. The cable can either run in front of the wall or behind wall. With the cable in front of the wall, installation is easier and requires no tools at all. To get the stunning, completely floating look, the cable must be ran behind the wall. Installing the cable behind the wall requires some skill and a drill, and takes about 15 minutes.

Internationally available


Wireless Power = 5W (1 Amp, 5 Volt) by Qi standard (WPC 1.1)



Charging Distance = 1/8 inch. *Phone must sit flat on WallJax Float.


USB Power Output = 10W (2 Amp, 5 Volt) from female USB-A receptacle


USB Power Input = 10W from USB Micro B cable (standard USB cable for phones)


Power cable entry, either from below or back

WallJax Float mounting: Standard or Handy mounts WallJax anywhere

Standard installation takes just minutes and requires no tools.  You can even use non-mark adhesive instead of screws.  


Handy installation give a stunning free floating look.

<h2>You want to order for Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa!</h2>
<h3>Good call! We’re projecting that both the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 versions will ship by February. If you’re ordering for the holidays, we’ll send a brochure in the mail for the case. Our elves work cheerfully until their tiny fingers give out, but they need a minimum of 4 hours of sleep per day and two 15-minute breaks for reindeer games.*</h3>
<h3>*Note: no elves were harmed in the making of Cavity Case.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Progress</h2>
<h3>The design is complete, and we’re currently working with mold makers in the U.S. to optimize the parts for production. Once we hit our goal, we’ll pull the trigger. It will take another 3-4 weeks to produce the tools, and an additional 2 weeks to produce our first production batch. After that, we’ll be shipping out product in February.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Rewards</h2>
<h3>So, the deal is, we know that once you get this case, all your friends will think it’s super clever and cool, and by the transitive property, you will be assumed (accurately) to be super clever and cool, as well. Everyone wants to be considered clever and cool, so they will buy the case also (like the sheep that they are) but YOU will be the first and therefore MOST clever and cool person. This is why we’re kickstarting the case at the low, low price of $39.  What’s that? Too generous, you say? No, no, we feel you’re helping us sell more, so we want to pass our marketing savings onto you, our early adopters! In seriousness, we really couldn’t do it without you.</h3>
<h3>After Kickstarter, we’re going to reassess the price point and our costs, and charge between $50 and $70 without the pen.</h3>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h2><em>Will stuff fall out?</em></h2>
<h3>Not without pulling it out. The mechanisms that hold things in place have been thoroughly tested and redesigned several times. This was the hardest aspect of the design to get correct, but we’re confident in it now.</h3>
<h2><em>How rugged is the case?</em></h2>
<h3>The case is made of a very rugged polymer (polycarbonate for stiffness combined with ABS for resilience). This combination is commonly used where impact is likely and is regarded as the best for this application. It also has a shiny and aesthetically pleasing look.</h3>
<h2><em>So cool, but I don’t have an iPhone!</em></h2>
<h3>We’re starting with the iPhone, but assuming this goes well, we will be developing cases for other phones as well. Stay tuned by liking <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/cavitycase"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/cavitycase</a>!</h3>
<h2><em>What kind of car keys does it accept?</em></h2>
<h3>The case fits almost all car keys we’ve tried, with a few exceptions for monstrous keys. If you’re worried, just take out your ruler and measure. If your car key doesn’t fit, you can attach it to the case on a key ring that we provide, carry it separately, or buy another car with a more respectable car key, whichever.</h3>
<h2><em>Will it take any size door or padlock key?</em></h2>
<h3>Yes, it takes most keys, but we won’t go as far as to say all. If you have one of those bizarre keys that won’t fit, you’ll know it, but measure it and it might fit in the key fob. If it looks like a normal house key or a short padlock key, that will almost certainly be fine.</h3>
<h2><em>How do the cards stay in?</em></h2>
<h3>Very well, actually. There is a slight taper on the card holder so that they bend in the middle (not enough to damage them… it’s more of a gentle nudge).  They are also pinched from the top and bottom as they slide in, allowing you to put one to five cards into the case and still have them held securely.</h3>
<h2><em>How do the keys stay in?</em></h2>
<h3>We spent a lot of time perfecting this mechanism. The slots have springs inside that pinch the keys hard enough that they can’t jiggle out, but flexibly enough to still allow you to pull them out without trouble.</h3>
<h2><em>What's the deal with the mirror?</em></h2>
<h3>It’s the size of a standard sized compact mirror and looks just like one.  It can be used to spy on people sitting behind you, to find and eliminate pieces of spinach stuck in your teeth, or to reflect light signals to passing ships if you become stranded on a desert island.</h3>
<h2><em>How does the hook mechanism keep the case together?</em></h2>
<h3>The two hooks that keep the top (colored part) and bottom (black part) connected snap together past a slight divot, so they don’t fall apart without a good push.</h3>
<h2><em>Can you put any size key fob in the storage area?</em></h2>
<h3>No, but it fits most medium-sized ones. If this is very important to you, check the size of yours ahead of time and ensure that it fits, but you can always put other things in that area.</h3>
<h2><em>Does the telescoping pen come with it?</em></h2>
<h3>Normally, no, but we’re throwing it in during the Kickstarter phase because we’re cool like that.</h3>
<h2><em>All of the other cases on the market are super lame and boring. How is yours so amazing and smart?</em></h2>
<h3>We know. It’s a real shame, but we’re here to help. Working through the technical issues we faced while designing this was extremely brain- and time-consuming. Thanks for your support!  </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h2>
<h3>We have some minor pre-tooling adjustments we will make. After that, we're prepared to develop the tooling and start producing parts. All the manufacturing will take place within the U.S. We’ve secured sourcing for all the components accompanying the case and are working with a highly qualified tool maker and plastic injection molding company in Southern California. Our team has experience in plastic injection molding and understands how to get accurate and consistent quality from our parts. The renderings show the various color options available and will be matched during production.</h3>
<h3>So you’re aware, we’re considering incorporating a way to connect a purse strap (not to be confused with the wrist strap we’re definitely incorporating) in the design, but we haven’t resolved a couple of issues with it, so we’re not promoting the case with that yet. We’ll keep you updated.</h3></div>","Put all your essentials in your iPhone 4 or 5 case!

<h1><strong>Advantages or Li-Polymer Batteries VS Li-ion Batteries</strong></h1>
<p>WaveJuice uses Lithium Polymer (Li-Po) batteries. They have several advantages over Lithium ion batteries (Li-ion or commonly known as 18650 Li-ion batteries), which are commonly used in other battery packs. Below are the advantages of Li-Po batteries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinner</li>
<li>Lighter in weight</li>
<li>Larger capacity to size ratio, which means having more capacity in the same size of batteries.</li>
<li>Lower chance of electrolyte leakage</li>
<li>Most importantly, safer to use. It has gelled electrolytes (while Li-ion batteries have liquid electrolytes). This gives more resistance to overcharging, overheating or short circuit.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=""Li-Polymer Cells"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/741/652/1e040a0918c9f798867079f8d9a9d371_large.jpg?1373646601"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h1><strong>How was WaveJuice born?</strong></h1>
<p>At the beginning, we conducted research on different battery packs in the market and discovered that most of them used a Li-ion cell which was thick and bulky. Worse still, it may be explosive after a long time of use at a high temperature. To build a thinner and safer battery pack, we decided to use a Li-Polymer cell,  which is slim in size and non-explosive, in WaveJuice. Li-ion contains liquid-form solvents in the cell, which may cause danger. In contrast, all parts in the Li-polymer cell are in solid form. Prototypes of the Li-polymer battery pack were built in order to confirm the slim outlook.</p>
<p>Building a slim battery pack is not our ultimate goal. What we aimed at is to develop a product which can revolutionize the traditional use of battery packs. To achieve this goal, we tried different methods to upgrade WaveJuice. Finally, we decided to make WaveJuice ‘wireless’. What is meant by ‘wireless’? It is not about Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, but about the charging method – Wireless Charging.</p>
<p>After long-term observation of the use of ordinary battery packs from people around, we discovered that battery packs always needed a USB cable for charging electronic devices (e.g. cell phones). In order to achieve our goal, we then built a prototype of wireless charging transmitter, which is a desktop wireless charger without a battery inside. After the technology of wireless charging had been approved, we started to build our final goal - WaveJuice (WJ-08Q). It has an 8000mAh battery inside and is with wireless charging technology. On the way to building WaveJuice, we have also developed 5 accessories (WJ-S3, WJ-S4, WJ-N2, WJ-A4, WJ-A5) which can turn several models of cell phones into wireless-able.</p>
<p>After over half a year of effort, WaveJuice was born. Enjoy it.</p>

Pointing is really easy. Just slide the green

touch pad scrolling because the device location is predetermined, and the laser
points right at the center of the device. Once you select the device, it

serve as a button for your device.Let's take the
receiver for instance. You can use the DVD button on the surface of thereceiver to play the DVD or change the
button position and locate it on the DVD machine.This way, we can also configure the TV to
display all devices with video output, like PC, DVD,Cable TV decoder and more, simply by
pointing at the actual devices.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>We recommended organizing the most useful and common device

the device's navigation arrows, if such exist, and so on.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Not every possible button of the remote control can be represented
on the icon set, simply because we want to
have the most common ones on the visual set; Nevertheless, all buttons appear in the “button spinner” on your
smartphone and we can choose and operate each and every one of them. Devices that use a
keypad can be operated from the drawer located at the right side of the
application, and for the comfort of the couch potatoes among us, plus andminus buttons, are available for zapping.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">When selecting a PC as a device to operate, the Total Control

the laser at the new device's bottom right corner.Now the system knows your device
location. The application will then connect automatically to Total Control's servers
in order to recognize the added device. You will be asked to select the device type, the
device brand name, and finally the model number. Now,the magic starts to happens. All device
codes and buttons will be downloaded to your system and all the visual buttons will be
recognized. Total Control's servers contain a large databaseof infrared codes that are continually
updated.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">But what happens if my device is very old or very new and I can't
find my device model inTotal Control's code

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Stinger and Blaster are <b>learning units </b>and they can be easily programed to recognize new devices, their
buttons, and IR codes. Thus, we can also teach the system to recognize devices that,
until now, could not be controlled directly, such as the left speaker, subwoofer and etc. We can

electronic devices becomes fun!With the ""Stinger"" unit (Bluetooth technology), all you have to
do is point the laser at the device you want to
operate.

Pointing is really easy. Just slide the green
button and point the laser at the desired device. This operation differs from
touch pad scrolling because the device location is predetermined, and the laser
points right at the center of the device. Once you select the device, it
appears on the “device spinner” on your smartphone.Next, select the desired button and click to
operate the device.The beauty of this system is that every object in the room can
serve as a button for your device.Let's take the
receiver for instance. You can use the DVD button on the surface of thereceiver to play the DVD or change the
button position and locate it on the DVD machine.This way, we can also configure the TV to
display all devices with video output, like PC, DVD,Cable TV decoder and more, simply by
pointing at the actual devices.
We recommended organizing the most useful and common device
functions into one well-designed
icon set. Thus, every device can use this icon set for its buttons.Now we
can use the Setup icon for example to setup every device and navigate thru its
menus by simply sliding the green button.The mute
icon can be used to mute any audio device. The arrows icon gives control over
the device's navigation arrows, if such exist, and so on.
Not every possible button of the remote control can be represented
on the icon set, simply because we want to
have the most common ones on the visual set; Nevertheless, all buttons appear in the “button spinner” on your
smartphone and we can choose and operate each and every one of them. Devices that use a
keypad can be operated from the drawer located at the right side of the
application, and for the comfort of the couch potatoes among us, plus andminus buttons, are available for zapping.
When selecting a PC as a device to operate, the Total Control
application can function both as a mouse and
keyboard.
Adding new devices to the system
is really easy!All you have to do is to use the device's perspective, push the
option menu button and select Add New Device
option. You will be asked to point the laser at the new device's top left corner. Then you will be asked to point
the laser at the new device's bottom right corner.Now the system knows your device
location. The application will then connect automatically to Total Control's servers
in order to recognize the added device. You will be asked to select the device type, the
device brand name, and finally the model number. Now,the magic starts to happens. All device
codes and buttons will be downloaded to your system and all the visual buttons will be
recognized. Total Control's servers contain a large databaseof infrared codes that are continually
updated.
But what happens if my device is very old or very new and I can't
find my device model inTotal Control's code
server?
Stinger and Blaster are learning units and they can be easily programed to recognize new devices, their
buttons, and IR codes. Thus, we can also teach the system to recognize devices that,
until now, could not be controlled directly, such as the left speaker, subwoofer and etc. We can
also create virtual devices, like pictures, that when selected, a PC application device or
function will be operated.

<p><b>Think
about the unthinkable.</b> Sadly, each
year around the world, <b>thousands</b> of people disappear
without a trace and <b>thousands</b> of our mothers, daughters and sisters are assaulted. These people are not just statistics or pictures on a
“Have you seen me” boards, they are our moms, dads, sons, daughters, friends,
classmates, and neighbors. With these tragedies in the forefront of our
minds, we developed the <b>Check In Be Safe (CIBS)</b> Emergency- Status Locator
Notification System (E-SLNS) and CIBS Network Communications Monitoring
Accountability System (NCMAS). </p><p></p>
<p><b>WHAT
EXACTLY IS CIBS?</b></p>
<p><b>PERSONAL
SAFETY (CIBS E-SLNS)</b></p>
<p>The
CIBS mobile application and its provisionally patented Emergency-Status,
Locator Notification System was created to reduce the time a person goes
missing from an abduction, or goes without assistance from emergency responders
due to incapacitation from accidents, physical assault, medical or mental
affliction while in solitary or isolated conditions. This is accomplished by
sending an automated alert message to the user’s authorized contact list with
his or her current or last geographical location, current photo, time stamp and
status if a proper response to the app’s hail is not received within the users
pre-defined time interval. Put simply, CIBS will alert others when you can't and authenticates the transmission's integrity. In the unfortunate event that
you are incapacitated or unable to request help for any reason, CIBS will be
your voice.</p>
<p><b>HOW
DOES CIBS WORK? </b></p>
<p>While
there are literally hundreds of uses for the CIBS E-SLNS, the following
fictional scenarios will give you an understanding of how it works. The
scenarios may prove graphic for some people, but they represent everyday
occurrences and should be regarded as such.</p>
<p><b>Scenario
A without CIBS: </b></p>
<p>Jane
Doe is a nurse working at a local hospital. She alternates between swing and
mid shifts so she routinely transits between home and work during dark
hours. Once she arrives at her job, it takes Jane five minutes to walk from her
car which is located in a parking garage a block away to the hospital's entry
doors. Every night she makes this trip without incident - until last night.
 </p>
<p>After
her shift ended last night, Jane headed for the parking garage as usual. Three
minutes into the walk to her car she heard a noise. She caught a glimpse of
someone to her left, but before she could react she was knocked unconscious. The
blow was severe enough to keep Jane unconscious for nearly fifteen minutes. As a result of her injuries, when Jane regained consciousness, she was
temporarily unable to speak and her vision was degraded to the point where she
could not locate and use her cell phone. By the time another nurse who was
also leaving work found Jane and got medical and police assistance, nearly
thirty-five minutes had passed. Due to the gap in time from attack to medical
assistance, Jane's injuries became life-threatening. With a half hour
start, Jane's assailant escaped police and was able to attack yet another innocent victim.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/406100/files/20140302191946-nurses-safety.jpg?1393816786"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><b>Alternative
Scenario A with CIBS:</b></p>
<p>Jane
Doe is a nurse working at a local hospital. She alternates between swing
and mid shifts so she routinely transits between home and work during dark
hours. Once she arrives at her job, it takes her five minutes to walk from her
car which is located in a parking garage a block away to the hospital's entry
doors. Every night she makes this trip without incident - until last
night. </p>
<p>After
her shift ended last night, Jane headed for the parking garage as usual. But
before she leaves the hospital, she takes a moment to activate CIBS. Jane knows
it takes her five minutes to get to her car, so she sets her check in interval
to 4 minutes. She is then prompted to take a CIBS selfie and provide any other
information that can uniquely identify or locate her in an emergency. She types
""walking to car parked at C14"". Three minutes into the walk to her
car Jane hears a noise. She catches a glimpse of someone to her left, but
before she can react she is knocked unconscious. One minute later “CIBS IS CALLING”
pops up on Jane's phone. She is unable to respond and CIBS immediately notifies
her contacts. Since she knows the walk to and from the hospital can be dangerous, one of Jane's contacts is the security station at the hospital.
One of the guards on duty immediately responds to the location identified by the CIBS alert while the second guard notifies hospital and local law enforcement. Jane is quickly transported
back to the hospital where she is immediately treated thereby preventing any
permanent damage sustained from her injuries. Meanwhile, police are able to
apprehend the assailant since he only had a five minute escape window. </p>
<p>Although
these scenarios are fictional, they are extremely relevant and could have been
pulled from any current newspaper or news report. In fact, here is an <a href=""http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/adelaide-nurses-carry-scissors-for-walk-across-city-parklands-after-dark/story-e6frea83-1226669024374"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">article</a> from an Australian website citing nurses having to carry scissors to feel safe while walking to and from work. You can probably relate with
your own similar personal encounters or from someone you know. The unfortunate fact
is we've all been in circumstances where a capability like CIBS would have been
an invaluable and possibly even life-saving tool. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/406178/files/20140302200955-nurse-scissors.jpg?1393819795"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p>

IS CIBS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER APPS?</b><p></p>
<p>First,
unlike others, CIBS is <b>NOT</b> a continuous surveillance app, it
only provides geographical data and safety information when requested to do so,
and <b>ONLY</b> to those contacts the user has predetermined. CIBS
provides additional security, and performs its functions without <b>EVER</b> compromising
user privacy! This decreases the chance users such as preteens to young adults
will circumvent the system and create a security threat just to maintain their
independence. </p>
<p>Second,
most apps comparable to CIBS are reactive by design, meaning the user has to
physically activate the app in the event of an incident, and are not
authenticated. Users of other apps are also not provided with functions and features that
would increase their chances of surviving an unforeseen event. For example, they don’t
account for situations where users may be unable to reach their phone, or where
users may need to activate an alert discreetly. </p>
<p>CIBS
literally can mean the difference between life and death. In instances where
EVERY SECOND COUNTS, you want CIBS in your corner. CIBS takes
an proactive stance when it comes to safety. With CIBS you can breathe a
little easier, and security is literally in the palm of your hands. </p>
<p><b>HELP
US SAVE JANE and JOHN DOE!</b></p>
<p>The
CIBS NCMAS utilizes the CIBS user authentication system to quickly and
accurately locate and account for missing personnel during active shooter
incidents, extremely inclement weather conditions, military unit mobility
exercises, and even youth events. A critical feature of the NCMAS is it provides a way to track the
movements of an active shooter so your CIBS networked community can avoid the
affected areas and can better weigh their escape options and emergency responders can
localize and contain the threat. </p>
<p><b>WHY
WE DEVELOPED CIBS and CIBS NCMAS </b></p>
<p>Like
you, every member of Totally Cool Travels has a family we love, friends we care
for, and a desire to go through life without any serious incidents or
accidents. We developed the CIBS application because in our dangerous and
uncertain world, safety has to be a daily consideration, and we need every additional tool in our arsenals to ensure our spouses get home safely, to make sure our parents or
grandparents have an effective way to alert us if they are incapacitated and have a medical emergency, to
help mitigate the number of sexual assaults on the campuses where our daughters attend,
and to allow an expedient way to account for our children, office workers, and
our neighbors in the event of an active shooter or natural disaster. We developed CIBS to do these things, but the primary reason we developed CIBS was to help save lives!</p><p>Help us fund CIBS so we can all enjoy an extra layer of protection and a NEW layer of
prevention that will provide peace of mind for ourselves, our loved ones,
co-workers or comrades in arms. </p>

YOU SHOULD USE CIBS </b><p></p>
<p> •
If you have ever been involved in any emergency situation you understand the
need for quick notification and accountability. </p>
<p> •
If you have seen the news recently you know that current Emergency Response
Plans in cities, office buildings or facilities need to be upgraded. </p>
<p> •
If something were to happen right now, how would you notify your loved ones if
you were unable to get to your phone and they were unable to hear your
screams? How long would it be before people started looking for you? </p>
<p> •
Do you trust your employer's current Emergency Management Plan? </p>
<p> •
Don’t you think it is time that we stop depending solely on Emergency
Responders and start doing everything we can to ensure we are protected? </p>

her shift ended last night, Jane headed for the parking garage as usual. Three
minutes into the walk to her car she heard a noise. She caught a glimpse of
someone to her left, but before she could react she was knocked unconscious. The
blow was severe enough to keep Jane unconscious for nearly fifteen minutes. As a result of her injuries, when Jane regained consciousness, she was
temporarily unable to speak and her vision was degraded to the point where she
could not locate and use her cell phone. By the time another nurse who was
also leaving work found Jane and got medical and police assistance, nearly
thirty-five minutes had passed. Due to the gap in time from attack to medical
assistance, Jane's injuries became life-threatening. With a half hour
start, Jane's assailant escaped police and was able to attack yet another innocent victim.
Alternative
Scenario A with CIBS:
Jane
Doe is a nurse working at a local hospital. She alternates between swing
and mid shifts so she routinely transits between home and work during dark
hours. Once she arrives at her job, it takes her five minutes to walk from her
car which is located in a parking garage a block away to the hospital's entry
doors. Every night she makes this trip without incident - until last
night. 
After
her shift ended last night, Jane headed for the parking garage as usual. But
before she leaves the hospital, she takes a moment to activate CIBS. Jane knows
it takes her five minutes to get to her car, so she sets her check in interval
to 4 minutes. She is then prompted to take a CIBS selfie and provide any other
information that can uniquely identify or locate her in an emergency. She types
""walking to car parked at C14"". Three minutes into the walk to her
car Jane hears a noise. She catches a glimpse of someone to her left, but
before she can react she is knocked unconscious. One minute later “CIBS IS CALLING”
pops up on Jane's phone. She is unable to respond and CIBS immediately notifies
her contacts. Since she knows the walk to and from the hospital can be dangerous, one of Jane's contacts is the security station at the hospital.
One of the guards on duty immediately responds to the location identified by the CIBS alert while the second guard notifies hospital and local law enforcement. Jane is quickly transported
back to the hospital where she is immediately treated thereby preventing any
permanent damage sustained from her injuries. Meanwhile, police are able to
apprehend the assailant since he only had a five minute escape window. 
Although
these scenarios are fictional, they are extremely relevant and could have been
pulled from any current newspaper or news report. In fact, here is an article from an Australian website citing nurses having to carry scissors to feel safe while walking to and from work. You can probably relate with
your own similar personal encounters or from someone you know. The unfortunate fact
is we've all been in circumstances where a capability like CIBS would have been
an invaluable and possibly even life-saving tool. 
CIBS
Overview 
 •
Authenticates user • Time sensitive automated Check In Feature • Secure by
design • No invasion of privacy • Unique features • Discrete  • Not just
another locator App • Easily integrated into any current Emergency Management
Plan  • Potential users pre-teens to active elders • Affordable 
HOW
IS CIBS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER APPS?
First,
unlike others, CIBS is NOT a continuous surveillance app, it
only provides geographical data and safety information when requested to do so,
and ONLY to those contacts the user has predetermined. CIBS
provides additional security, and performs its functions without EVER compromising
user privacy! This decreases the chance users such as preteens to young adults
will circumvent the system and create a security threat just to maintain their
independence. 
Second,
most apps comparable to CIBS are reactive by design, meaning the user has to
physically activate the app in the event of an incident, and are not
authenticated. Users of other apps are also not provided with functions and features that
would increase their chances of surviving an unforeseen event. For example, they don’t
account for situations where users may be unable to reach their phone, or where
users may need to activate an alert discreetly. 
CIBS
literally can mean the difference between life and death. In instances where
EVERY SECOND COUNTS, you want CIBS in your corner. CIBS takes
an proactive stance when it comes to safety. With CIBS you can breathe a
little easier, and security is literally in the palm of your hands. 
HELP
US SAVE JANE and JOHN DOE!
The
CIBS NCMAS utilizes the CIBS user authentication system to quickly and
accurately locate and account for missing personnel during active shooter
incidents, extremely inclement weather conditions, military unit mobility
exercises, and even youth events. A critical feature of the NCMAS is it provides a way to track the
movements of an active shooter so your CIBS networked community can avoid the
affected areas and can better weigh their escape options and emergency responders can
localize and contain the threat. 
WHY
WE DEVELOPED CIBS and CIBS NCMAS 
Like
you, every member of Totally Cool Travels has a family we love, friends we care
for, and a desire to go through life without any serious incidents or
accidents. We developed the CIBS application because in our dangerous and
uncertain world, safety has to be a daily consideration, and we need every additional tool in our arsenals to ensure our spouses get home safely, to make sure our parents or
grandparents have an effective way to alert us if they are incapacitated and have a medical emergency, to
help mitigate the number of sexual assaults on the campuses where our daughters attend,
and to allow an expedient way to account for our children, office workers, and
our neighbors in the event of an active shooter or natural disaster. We developed CIBS to do these things, but the primary reason we developed CIBS was to help save lives!Help us fund CIBS so we can all enjoy an extra layer of protection and a NEW layer of
prevention that will provide peace of mind for ourselves, our loved ones,
co-workers or comrades in arms. 
WHY
YOU SHOULD USE CIBS 
 •
If you have ever been involved in any emergency situation you understand the
need for quick notification and accountability. 
 •
If you have seen the news recently you know that current Emergency Response
Plans in cities, office buildings or facilities need to be upgraded. 
 •
If something were to happen right now, how would you notify your loved ones if
you were unable to get to your phone and they were unable to hear your
screams? How long would it be before people started looking for you? 
 •
Do you trust your employer's current Emergency Management Plan? 
 •
Don’t you think it is time that we stop depending solely on Emergency
Responders and start doing everything we can to ensure we are protected?

<h1>THE CONNECTED CAR HAS ARRIVED!</h1>
<p>We all live in a connected world with our mobiles and other Internet enabled devices. So why is it then that once we enter a car, all of that seems to either stop or become a messy and unsafe experience? Why shouldn't you be able to receive a Skype call just as easily as a hands free mobile call? Or have an email read out in a human voice instead of fumbling for a mobile phone in your lap (illegally)? </p>
<h1>THE MISSION</h1>
<p>This project is about taking the things we like to do technologically and making them user friendly, safe and legal in an automotive environment.</p>
<p>Our aim is to lead the way with a connected vehicle solution that embraces  technology in a manner that allows users to safely do the things that they would otherwise attempt to do discreetly &amp; dangerously on a mobile device.</p>
<p>We want to see distraction related accidents reduced but it is our belief that this cannot be achieved through introducing restrictive laws that cannot be adequately policed, but by harnessing technology to enable the functionality that people now demand in a way that is safe and makes sense.</p>
<p>So how do you encourage drivers to use such a device? Well firstly, you make it very, very cool! Next, you make it user-friendly and finally, it has to do the things that we now expect to be able to do, regardless of driving a vehicle or not! </p>
<p>Gizmosis has been researching and marketing car computers and other connected devices since 2007 with the aim of truly understanding the needs of users, as well as waiting for the technology to mature enough for it to become a mainstream product...that time has finally come! </p>

<p>You also get a device running Android OS that allows you to download and fully customise your driving experience. With over half a million apps available, there is no limit to what you can do!</p>
<p>Some of our favourite activities include:</p>
<ul>

<p>The other great benefit of an app driven system is that it never becomes outdated. Whereas most car entertainment systems are heavily reliant on their hardware, there is no shortage of new apps being constantly released to add additional functionality.</p>
<h1>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</h1>
<p>Ever since Michael Knight aka David Hasselhoff appeared on TV in the 80's driving a heavily modified Trans Am sporting the ultimate in artificial intelligence, it was a dream to recreate this.</p>
<p>In fact, several years ago, we released a Windows based car computer that you could converse with:</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/mVzGzXYy20E"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Watch Cybershack Video </a></p>

<p>Then a shift began towards app based platforms and we aligned ourselves with this new direction.</p>
<p>With around half a million apps available on Google Play (formerly Android Market), there is no limit to how you can customise your experience.</p>
<p>Many were trying to achieve an in-car experience that parallelled their mobile phone experience however the results ranged from cumbersome workarounds to just being unsafe!</p>
<p>Whilst many states are debating the use of technology in vehicles and some even trying to legislate against it's use, the reality is that many people will still try and check messages on their phones in their lap and continue to pursue other  dangerous behaviours.</p>
<p>So rather than pretend that it won't happen, we have taken the step of actively trying to find safe ways of keeping connected.</p>
<p><img alt=""Voice Settings"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://myotto.com.au/images/stories/otto/vsettings.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>So...</h1>
<p>In order to make this a reality, we need your help!!</p>
<p>Firstly, we want your ideas. We want to hear what you would want in a system like this. What features, apps and design elements would you like?</p>
<p>We have developed a user environment where key functions such as media controls and information feeds can be easily accessed through our custom UI as well as via voice command and text-to-speech.</p>
<p>Now we need funding to get this produced!</p>
<p>The otto hardware is already rolling off the production line.</p>
<p><img alt=""Factory"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://myotto.com.au/images/stories/otto/factory.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Funds will be used to build the software design for otto as well as fulfil the minimum order quantities that we need to manufacture at a reasonable cost. We also need to receive your input for features that you would like incorporated and then build these in.</p>
<p>In return, we are offering the Indiegogo community the opportunity to be the first to get hold of the new units at a heavily discounted price. The rewards provide a significant saving off the launch price and even greater savings for those who act earliest!</p>
<p>You will also have your name forever credited with contributing to the product's development. You will be recognised on our website's product page as well as here on our campaign page.</p>
<p>For those that are pre-ordering the new unit, you will also be on our beta test list and will be amongst the first to try out new apps and updates before they are released to the general public.</p>
<h1>Stretch Goals</h1>
<p>If we are able to reach our goal of $120,000 then we will be able to deliver an awesome product.</p>
<p>If we are fortunate enough to exceed our goal then we have plans to introduce even more features into OTTO including:</p>
<p><strong>$150K</strong> - we will create the software development kit (SDK) so you will be able to create your own apps to work within OTTO's safe operating environment</p>
<p><strong>$200K</strong> - we will integrate even more functions into OTTO's voice control at launch including Twitter, news feeds, AM/FM radio &amp; many others </p>

Many were trying to achieve an in-car experience that parallelled their mobile phone experience however the results ranged from cumbersome workarounds to just being unsafe!
Whilst many states are debating the use of technology in vehicles and some even trying to legislate against it's use, the reality is that many people will still try and check messages on their phones in their lap and continue to pursue other  dangerous behaviours.
So rather than pretend that it won't happen, we have taken the step of actively trying to find safe ways of keeping connected.

So...
In order to make this a reality, we need your help!!
Firstly, we want your ideas. We want to hear what you would want in a system like this. What features, apps and design elements would you like?
We have developed a user environment where key functions such as media controls and information feeds can be easily accessed through our custom UI as well as via voice command and text-to-speech.
Now we need funding to get this produced!
The otto hardware is already rolling off the production line.

Funds will be used to build the software design for otto as well as fulfil the minimum order quantities that we need to manufacture at a reasonable cost. We also need to receive your input for features that you would like incorporated and then build these in.
In return, we are offering the Indiegogo community the opportunity to be the first to get hold of the new units at a heavily discounted price. The rewards provide a significant saving off the launch price and even greater savings for those who act earliest!
You will also have your name forever credited with contributing to the product's development. You will be recognised on our website's product page as well as here on our campaign page.
For those that are pre-ordering the new unit, you will also be on our beta test list and will be amongst the first to try out new apps and updates before they are released to the general public.
Stretch Goals
If we are able to reach our goal of $120,000 then we will be able to deliver an awesome product.
If we are fortunate enough to exceed our goal then we have plans to introduce even more features into OTTO including:
$150K - we will create the software development kit (SDK) so you will be able to create your own apps to work within OTTO's safe operating environment
$200K - we will integrate even more functions into OTTO's voice control at launch including Twitter, news feeds, AM/FM radio & many others

<p>We are a small company with big ideas - with the simple goal of delivering better mobile life to people. Each of us has a real passion for electronics and high quality consumer products. Project S is supported by BungBungame (founded in 2008), which is headquartered in Taiwan, with a subsidiary in Ginza, Tokyo. BungBungame specializes in mobile applications and tablets design.</p>
<p>For understanding consumers’ needs, we have studied the consumer usage and worked with Consumer Behavior Experts for years. As a result, we have already successfully launched 2 generations of tablets over Taiwan, Japan and USA.</p>

<p>Our reason for starting Project S is simple: there are no low-cost and high quality smartphone that meets most of consumers’ needs. In fact, all high-tech smartphones are a staggering $750~$849, rendering them unaffordable to most customers. </p>
<p>In 2012, we decided to design a solution to this problem ourselves. With your help, we will be ready to take Project S into production.</p>

<p>We have been working on this for 2 years.<br/>We have flown round the world and back, met with tech experts, manufactures, and sourced everything along the product lifecycle. We’ve done the whole nine yards to find the best suppliers and manufactures. We have hand-picked our product partners to ensure that we can deliver quality parts, on time and cost effectively. </p>
<p>Our suppliers and manufactures have promised to produce with the small quantities. But they would need to know our estimated number of units needed before they begin production. We take this last step seriously, and will need a lot of support to do the job right. That is the reason why we have turned to Indiegogo to get the production lines up and running. We believe we can reach the goal with you suport!</p>

We are so excited that there are more and more people who support us through many different ways.
We appriciate that every little support from all of you. All we want is brining the world the perfect smartphone - Project S to all of you.
Please keep spreading out Project S to let more and more people to hear our voice!
Thank you! 
 


We were so excited that we had this great opportunity to introduce our Project S to every media and PR companies in CES Unveiled New York on 12th November 2013. 
Many thanks that there were so many people interested in our Project S and wished that will be able to see this great mobile device in the future. With all of your support, we will be able to make Project S into reality. 
 
 


 
                                      
Project S, a project seeking to bring the world a smartphoneto fit all your needs.Project S phone  is our vision of the perfect smartphone - delivering on all fronts, with countless innovative features, and world class specs.


 


 
 


 

We are a small company with big ideas - with the simple goal of delivering better mobile life to people. Each of us has a real passion for electronics and high quality consumer products. Project S is supported by BungBungame (founded in 2008), which is headquartered in Taiwan, with a subsidiary in Ginza, Tokyo. BungBungame specializes in mobile applications and tablets design.
For understanding consumers’ needs, we have studied the consumer usage and worked with Consumer Behavior Experts for years. As a result, we have already successfully launched 2 generations of tablets over Taiwan, Japan and USA.



Our reason for starting Project S is simple: there are no low-cost and high quality smartphone that meets most of consumers’ needs. In fact, all high-tech smartphones are a staggering $750~$849, rendering them unaffordable to most customers. 
In 2012, we decided to design a solution to this problem ourselves. With your help, we will be ready to take Project S into production.


We have been working on this for 2 years.We have flown round the world and back, met with tech experts, manufactures, and sourced everything along the product lifecycle. We’ve done the whole nine yards to find the best suppliers and manufactures. We have hand-picked our product partners to ensure that we can deliver quality parts, on time and cost effectively. 
Our suppliers and manufactures have promised to produce with the small quantities. But they would need to know our estimated number of units needed before they begin production. We take this last step seriously, and will need a lot of support to do the job right. That is the reason why we have turned to Indiegogo to get the production lines up and running. We believe we can reach the goal with you suport!
 



Since we have already finished our initial studies and research about designing a smartphone and how to solve the tech problems, we need your support for purchasing components and patent application costs. 

Project S is equipped many great functions and powerful spec, which has never all come together in any single device. To ensure the innovative new user interface and powerful hardware can function together harmoniously, we have to test to make sure that everyone who supports our project will receive only the highest quality smartphone. 

For the production line, we need your support to secure procurement of long lead components and meet the minimum order quantities required by our suppliers and manufactures.

A smartphone needs a smart packing. We only have one earth. With a mimal, yet strong design, we will design the packaging without any unnecessary fluff while using only eco-friendly materials.
The amount of funding we require to achieve the final milestones is $500,000. We hope you will find it in your heart to help us deliver this long sought after, valuable and powerful technology.

<p>We welcome you, if you have fun, making crazy and creative videos or photos
  and to become famous with it in the Internet area. </p>
<p>Аs well as you we also are great fans of fun, and at the same time we
  are the team of the «FlashMober» project, and we’re going to tell the entire
  world  about it today. </p>
<p>All of us are users of an enormous number of social networks,
  subscribers of hundreds of social communities and famous bloggers who are
  spending with these kilometers of timelines hours and hours without a break. Let’s
  agree that sometimes it becomes quite boring and doesn't bring that fun and
  interest any more. How often do you want something more fascinating and new?
  Something that you didn't try or participate  yet?</p>
<p>We decided to change this and to try something absolutely new. After absolutely
  incredible videos ""Harlemshake"", ""Ice bucket challenge""
  and many other flashmobs with push-ups, parodies of celebrities and other
  interesting, and sometimes even useful subjects, we’ve been disappointed that
  all of them were scattered through the internet as planets in galaxies! It is
  so interesting and funny, but hard to find a new flashmob or to join it when
  you don’t even know about its existence.</p>
<p>Have a look. How!? HOW is it possible not to take part in such epic masterpieces and not to make the similar parody? It just blows one’s mind! </p>

</div>
<p>We were drawing, looking for performers, designers, programmers, creative producers, operators, advertisers, photographers and we visited a lot of other professionals in great amount of areas. We communicated with all of them, considering criticism, advices, wishes and remarks from potential users. Taking into account that it’s the first time we make such project, it was extremely difficult for us, but finally it seems that we have managed the task. We will be honest with you, we have managed with tremendous quantity of mistakes and a lot of work is still to be done, but we really like it! :)</p>
<p>For bright, active and extraordinary users tired of trivial selfies and food photos, we are glad to present you the FlashMober project. Our platform is a mobile application where users exchange the most interesting and outstanding flashmobs!</p>

  can put likes and comments to reports (photos and videos) and look through
  all reports which have been made to any of tasks. Users can also share their
  masterpieces with friends by publishing them on popular social networks.</span><br/></p>
<p>The most interesting and challenging thing will be sending and

  creating a task, the user can send it worldwide, and moreover no report will
  be lost, all results of a task can be seen in the history of its performance.</p>

We welcome you, if you have fun, making crazy and creative videos or photos
  and to become famous with it in the Internet area. 
Аs well as you we also are great fans of fun, and at the same time we
  are the team of the «FlashMober» project, and we’re going to tell the entire
  world  about it today. 
All of us are users of an enormous number of social networks,
  subscribers of hundreds of social communities and famous bloggers who are
  spending with these kilometers of timelines hours and hours without a break. Let’s
  agree that sometimes it becomes quite boring and doesn't bring that fun and
  interest any more. How often do you want something more fascinating and new?
  Something that you didn't try or participate  yet?
We decided to change this and to try something absolutely new. After absolutely
  incredible videos ""Harlemshake"", ""Ice bucket challenge""
  and many other flashmobs with push-ups, parodies of celebrities and other
  interesting, and sometimes even useful subjects, we’ve been disappointed that
  all of them were scattered through the internet as planets in galaxies! It is
  so interesting and funny, but hard to find a new flashmob or to join it when
  you don’t even know about its existence.
Have a look. How!? HOW is it possible not to take part in such epic masterpieces and not to make the similar parody? It just blows one’s mind! 
Download the app IOS can here








 







Having decided to fix this howling shame and to give a chance to all hankers to cross from a roadside of Internet entertainments to its front line, we started to develop the concept of the platform which has to gather fans of such flashmobs together, and it definitely will be hundred times more convenient and more interesting than just sending each other such tasks by  messages.

We were drawing, looking for performers, designers, programmers, creative producers, operators, advertisers, photographers and we visited a lot of other professionals in great amount of areas. We communicated with all of them, considering criticism, advices, wishes and remarks from potential users. Taking into account that it’s the first time we make such project, it was extremely difficult for us, but finally it seems that we have managed the task. We will be honest with you, we have managed with tremendous quantity of mistakes and a lot of work is still to be done, but we really like it! :)
For bright, active and extraordinary users tired of trivial selfies and food photos, we are glad to present you the FlashMober project. Our platform is a mobile application where users exchange the most interesting and outstanding flashmobs!
What is the app?









The point of the application is creation, implementation and sharing
  of various flashmobs, tasks and challenges with users. Users can create and
  carry out flashmobs,  and  photo or video files loaded by users to
  their profiles and history of performance of the task are the reports. Users
  can put likes and comments to reports (photos and videos) and look through
  all reports which have been made to any of tasks. Users can also share their
  masterpieces with friends by publishing them on popular social networks.
The most interesting and challenging thing will be sending and
  receiving tasks among absolutely unfamiliar people. In other words, after
  creating a task, the user can send it worldwide, and moreover no report will
  be lost, all results of a task can be seen in the history of its performance.
In a word, there is almost everything that all of us like so much :)
Just have a look how it looks in the app! It is extremely funny and
  interesting!






When you use telekinesis Flashmob!


Funny cosplay Flashmob!

Why our platform will be interesting and convenient for our users?






1. Users will be able to share tasks not only with friends, but also
  to send them to the ""cloud"", from where tasks will go to totally
  unfamiliar people. Come on, it will be unfair if  strangers are deprived of opportunity to
  brag talents in your genious flashmob ☺
2. The same task can be performed by different users hundreds or even
  maybe thousands times, but some results can become real masterpieces of the
  modern art. It will be a pity if you aren't able to find these masterpieces.
  In our appendix everyone can see how this or that task was implemented by
  other users, as we will have an easy-to-use system of viewing the reports of
  all users.
3. Any user will be able to join any flashmob he likes and to
  implement it! (All the best is for children (c) :)
4. Hashtags, likes, comments, pages with the most popular reports,
  friends, subscriptions and subscribers! Wherewecangowithoutallofit?! ☺
  
5. Besides, there will be a lot of amusing tasks and users’ reports in
  the application, we also will collect and carry out the best, interesting and
  bright tasks and to appoint them to users;
6. Like cats? Ok! Fancy about magnificent landscapes or more serious social subjects? No problem! We give you a possibility to filter the content in your timeline;













We hope that our platform will become a new milestone of social
  interaction among users and we will set a new format of entertainment in the Internet.
  
Now we have almost ready app version for iOS which is being tested and
  is available to download in App Store (by the way, your opinion on
  functionality and easement of the app is very important for us, thus we
  weekly collect comments & wishes and consider them in the following
  releases of the application).
























We want to release the version for Android devices in order to target
  more users and increase quantity of extra interesting flashmobs and reports
  as much as possible. Moreover, we want to expand  functionality seriously and to improve app’s
  design ;).




As all our budget is over after programming of iOS version, server part and the organization of all this madness, and Android version is necessary to us as air, we decided to storm IndieGOGO. We hope that with your help we ""will recieve a great experience and leve-up"" and release Android version!

















We hope that with your help we ""will recieve a great experience
  and leve-up"" and release Android version!
The necessary budget consist of following:
1. Development of design models;
2. Development of  work algorithms
  for Adroid version;
3. Client part programming;
4.Server part programming and modernization;
5. Server part  upgrade ;
6. iOS app’s version  improvings;
7. Project management;
8.Commission for the platform and payment  for service provider;
9. Taxes.








Everybody who will help the project will be rewarded by our kowtow???, words of gratitude and, of course, a number of pleasant bonuses :)

crown on your profile picture. This crown will be granted only to sponsors
and  symbolize you as one of creators and

</p><p>We are an international team of six engineers, system administrators and security experts between 40 and 50 years of age. We have been working together for the past fifteen years on projects such as e-commerce, secure file sharing, private telecommunications, and finance. Our customers include big and moderately sized companies in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe. Our team comes from three countries: Switzerland, Italy and Russia.</p>
<p>The <i><a href=""www.mailshield.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mailshield</a></i> project was born from a simple, yet profound series of discussions. Essentially, what we have been doing for companies can be of help to professionals  and private citizens all over the world. The whistleblower, Edward Snowden, had the world stand up and understand what we in computer security have been suspecting for some time. Governments and big data companies, together, have subverted the phone system, the email system, and the web. Privacy is dead for you if you, the consumer, the citizen, do not take a stand and choose to protect yourself. We are here to help.</p>
<p>We have searched for the technologies that can protect telecommunication. We have looked for all the defects present in protocols, softwares, and operating systems  subverted by national security agencies and hackers. Here, the Edward Snowden papers have been paramount. For example, we now know that <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/nsa-dreams-of-quantum-computer-that-can-break-encryption/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the NSA has been investing almost a hundred million dollars for a quantum computer, but still they don’t have one</a>. A quantum computer is theoretically predicted to be capable of breaking Diffie-Hellmann crypto. Therefore, we are using  Diffie-Hellmann crypto everywhere to ensure that our data will be safe even from the powerful NSA.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/400124/files/20140228004109-dreamstimeextrasmall_23953118.jpg?1393576869"" src="""" style=""width: 477.55102040816325px; height: 390px;""/></p><p></p>
<p>We have decided to create a brand new company for this. Mailshield will be incorporated in Switzerland (a democracy which is centuries old and treasures privacy) and will only work on secure telecommunications — starting with email, then branching into file storage and voice — for the people and the small companies who do not have the equipment and resources necessary to protect themselves. If we are successful, we plan to develop the business.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Why Switzerland</h3><p>When you think of Switzerland you probably come up with postcard images of precision watches, cheese and chocolate, and snow peaks and banks. But consider that Switzerland is a multi-lingual, multi-religion confederacy of sovereign states, under a federal charter since 1291. For more than eight centuries Switzerland has been independent and neutral: from the Holy Roman Empire to the European Powers under the Council of Vienna, and from NATO to the Warsaw pact. It remains firm in its neutrality today, as is evident in the case of European Union.</p><p>The Swiss Federal Constitution  is among the oldest constitutions in the world, making Switzerland a direct democracy. The central government is granted very limited powers (there are only seven government departments and the president is one of the seven ministers, holding office for only one year granted no additional powers). The citizens can revoke or propose laws, and even change the Constitution itself by referendum.</p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What will your dollars buy?</span><br/></p><p>The funds we receive will go towards:</p><ul>

Looking towards the impending future, we will get competition, which will raise the bar for everybody. If Google is finally forced to add security to GMail, for example -- if they start supporting the S/MIME protocol for which every security professional in the world has been asking for years -- everybody wins. In the long term, even boneheaded politicians all over the world will start to get the message: we, the people, care for our privacy; so move your big asses and do your jobs, politicos: change the laws, dismiss the people in charge of your secret services and make the Internet the secure place it was always meant to be.</p><p>Let's do this together.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/400128/files/20140228004610-Defend_your_rights.jpg?1393577170"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p></div>","The Shield that Guards your Privacy

<div>
<p></p>
<p> Up to now, the only way we could create crafts utilizing sensors, motors, and LEDs was by using Arduino. However, it is nearly impossible for beginners to use Arduino without the knowledge of soldering or wires, electrical engineering and coding.</p>
<p> You can create your work by just connecting sensors, motors and LEDs with the data cable. When beginners start to enjoy making through BitCube, they can then develop capacity to challenge themselves with harder hardware kits, such as Arduino. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1126774/files/20150102000219-EasyControl_r2.jpg?1420185739"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Programming is difficult.</h4>
<p> Young children need outstanding programming knowledge in order to use sensors, motors, and LEDs. Even for adults, without having enough programming knowledge, simply making a motor run can cause a brain cramp. </p>
<p> BitCube, on the other hand, with its interface that requires more intuition rather than the technical knowledge, makes controlling of sensor, motor, and LED very easy as all one needs to do is simply push and turn the knob on the output modules.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1106288/files/20141218214000-IFModeGIFAni.gif?1418967600"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h4></h4>
<h4>BitCube is easy and simple.</h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> You do not need any knowledge of soldering or electrical engineering to use BitCube. Moreover, there is no need of computer connection and programming. </p>
<p> BitCube allows you to focus on creation. Let's Learn and Run BitCube!</p>

<ul><li><p> BitCube is a set of tangible block that consist of three functional parts, Power + Sensor + Output. Power module is a type of rechargeable battery with Micro USB connector. BitCube has diverse sensor modules which are perceiving data, such as light, distance, sound, bluetooth signal, etc. Output modules receive data from sensor modules, and actuate LED, buzzer, motor, effector, etc.</p></li></ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1153003/files/20150116003603-BitCube_Modules_specs.jpg?1421397363"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>In order to use BitCube, one needs to connect modules in the following order: sensor module, power module, and output module. The value generated by a sensor is transferred to an output module through a power module.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1091125/files/20141212011034-ConnectModulesAni.gif?1418375434"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li><p>All output modules work in either ""Pass Mode"" or ""IF Mode"" and you get to make your selection when you build with BitCube. In Pass Mode, the output module operates with the same input value from the sensor module.</p></li>
<li><p>IF Mode is what makes BitCube really special. <b>BitCube does not require any additional computer devices or software for coding. </b>IF Mode basically does that for you by comparing the value picked up by a sensor with the value set by you in advance. When you use IF Mode, you can utilize mathematical conditions such as “greater than”, “smaller than”, and “equal to” to control when and how an output module will operate. Depending on whether the condition you set up is satisfied (True) or not satisfied (False), you can choose which value an output module will generate. <b>All of this “programming” can be done by simply pushing and turning the knob on a BitCube.</b></p></li>
</ul>

<ul><li><p> For example, let’s  say that you have created a smart light bulb that turns itself on when the room is dark and turns itself off when the room gets bright. If you want to make the light bulb to stay on while the room is bright, you can do that by merely setting up your own condition using IF Mode.</p></li></ul>       <div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F3fCxGroO_fY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3fCxGroO_fY&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F3fCxGroO_fY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><ul>
<li><p> In other words, users can use IF Mode to modify conditions and follow results right away. This allows <b><i>instant debugging</i></b>: you can have immediate interaction with programs using your hand as an instrument.</p></li>
<li><p> Although very simple, <b>BitCube is an exceptional tool that can encourage effective learning of programming. </b>As one can immediately be provided with numerous feedback such as movement of a motor or changing level of LED’s brightness that stimulate one’s senses, he/she can easily learn the associated algorithm.</p></li>

<p> BitCube is a tech kit that is easy and accessible for people of all ages even without the prior knowledge of programming. With its sensor, motor, and LED, BitCube allows you to build your own unique creation. You only need creativity to pull you through. You can utilize other materials like paper, tape, and personal 3D printers to develop something of your own. It also comes with the ability to combine with LEGO, so you can also come up with ways to move your current LEGO sets!</p>

<p>  We created <b>BitCube, “The World's Most Simple Tech Kit of Sensor, Motor, and LED Controls.”</b></p>
<p> Now on a bigger scale, what will BitCube impact? The issue BitCube is solving is in regards to STEAM education. This is a multi-dimensional curriculum featuring:</p>
<p>Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics. </p>
<p> Within the STEAM education curriculum, there are various times where you need to use sensors motors and LEDs. However, existing kits in the market were expensive and difficult to follow, having a pre requirement of extensive programming knowledge. BitCube is the best method that allows easiest way for children to experience STEAM education.</p>
<p> We now have to remember that kids like creating, and building, and playing games. On their computers and on their smart phones. They are constantly surrounded by new programs. The lack of hands-on environment on technology is really unfortunate. Then what can we give them without the boundaries of a screen with the objective of creative construction? How do we give the kids the satisfaction when they make something on their own? Well, BitCube gives the opportunity for kids to move, collaborate, create, and develop a product without a “right or wrong” result. With BitCube’s different modules and functions that include sensor, motor, and LED, the users can connect and build like Lego while learning the fundamentals of programming logic. </p>
<p> We started in South Korea in early 2013 with a vision to make a mark in the extremely narrow-framed South Korean education system.<br/> But we vie to encourage our principle across the world. To introduce STEAM curriculum into as many educational systems around the world to enhance the next generation’s creativity and technological logic and to encourage geeks from a young age to lead them to become what they can uniquely be.</p>
<p> Help BitCube complete our mission. </p>

<h4> Can I still purchase BitCube even when you do not reach the funding goal?</h4>
<p> BitCube opts for fixed funding, because we need a minimum budget ($100,000) to begin BitCube's mass production. Without achieving our campaign goal, you will unfortunately not be able to purchase BitCube.</p>
<h4> Can I get more than one BitCube kit?</h4>
<p> Of course! You can email us at <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/bitcube-push-turn-it-s-enough-for-programming/edit/info@bitcube.cc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@bitcube.cc</a>with the list of perks you are interested in.</p>
<h4> Can I mix &amp; match separate modules in different amounts?</h4>
<p>Yes. We would like to facilitate everyone's needs. Please email us at <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/bitcube/edit/info@bitcube.cc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@bitcube.cc</a> with your selected modules and amounts for each module for a specialized perk value. </p>
<h4> When will I receive my BitCube kit?</h4>
<p> We plan to ship in April, 2015, after manufacturing and packaging stages. The shipping itself would take about 5~10 days depending on your address. </p>
<h4> What’s the difference between BitCube and LittleBits?</h4>
<p> There is no argument that LittleBits is a superb product. Also, it is used as an effective educational kit for children. LittleBits is an innovative kit that comes with a magnetic modules that make the product both easily attachable and detachable. However, LittleBits is limited to a simple function of only receiving a value from a sensor and transferring that value into an output module. In BitCube language, this is equivalent to only having Pass Mode available, and therefore, the kit lacks of hands-on customization that BitCube provides to its users through its own unique ""IF Mode"". </p>
<h4> Is the BitCube product open source? </h4>
<p> At the moment, BitCube is not open source, but we are planning to release it later in time. </p>
<p>We will first release the API for smartphone in order to connect gadgets with BitCube's Bluetooth module. With this API, developers will be able to create apps for BitCube. </p>
<h4> How is BitCube charged?</h4>
<p> BitCube power is charged using Micro-USB cords (conventional smartphone charging cords). It takes 4 hours for a full recharge, and lasts 3~5 hours depending on usage.</p>
<h4> How safe is it to use BitCube?</h4>
<p> With the exception of our Bluetooth module, BitCube does not generate electromagnetic waves of any risk. However, as there is still a flowing current of 5 volts within the data cables, it is recommended not to place cables near sensitive areas such as skin or mouth for a long duration. </p>
<h4> Who would be the primary users of BitCube?</h4>
<p> BitCube was originally created to help 5 to 15 year old children make their own projects without the need to learn programming. But by all means, adults without programming knowledge can also use BitCube to make their own creations. Media artists, kinetic installation designers, architects, and engineers are some examples of professions that would use BitCube.  </p>
<h4> Does BitCube support Scratch integration?</h4>
<p> Not yet... But coming soon! </p>
<p> Scratch (<a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a>) is a globally ubiquitous educational tool that helps children learn coding. A great number of elementary schools throughout the world is using Scratch to encourage coding education. In order to control sensors, motors, and LEDs, children uses a tool such as S4A (Scratch for Arduino), but as mentioned before, Arduino is more difficult than what we want for the children. </p>
<p> As expected, BitCube is now preparing a new version of BitCube that would facilitate the entire learning experience through Scratch compatibility. <br/></p>

</div></div>","BitCube is an innovative programming interface which you can code by simply pushing or turning on the physical block with your fingertips without the hassle of connecting to a computer.
 By controlling sensor, motor, and LED by your hands, algorithmic thinking and programming are easily feasible with BitCube's tech kit.























 World's Most Simple Tech Kit of Sensor, Motor, and LED Controls.                            Just Push & Turn for Fun!

Arduino is difficult. 


 Up to now, the only way we could create crafts utilizing sensors, motors, and LEDs was by using Arduino. However, it is nearly impossible for beginners to use Arduino without the knowledge of soldering or wires, electrical engineering and coding.
 You can create your work by just connecting sensors, motors and LEDs with the data cable. When beginners start to enjoy making through BitCube, they can then develop capacity to challenge themselves with harder hardware kits, such as Arduino. 


Programming is difficult.
 Young children need outstanding programming knowledge in order to use sensors, motors, and LEDs. Even for adults, without having enough programming knowledge, simply making a motor run can cause a brain cramp. 
 BitCube, on the other hand, with its interface that requires more intuition rather than the technical knowledge, makes controlling of sensor, motor, and LED very easy as all one needs to do is simply push and turn the knob on the output modules.


BitCube is easy and simple.


 You do not need any knowledge of soldering or electrical engineering to use BitCube. Moreover, there is no need of computer connection and programming. 
 BitCube allows you to focus on creation. Let's Learn and Run BitCube!




 BitCube is a set of tangible block that consist of three functional parts, Power + Sensor + Output. Power module is a type of rechargeable battery with Micro USB connector. BitCube has diverse sensor modules which are perceiving data, such as light, distance, sound, bluetooth signal, etc. Output modules receive data from sensor modules, and actuate LED, buzzer, motor, effector, etc.



In order to use BitCube, one needs to connect modules in the following order: sensor module, power module, and output module. The value generated by a sensor is transferred to an output module through a power module.


All output modules work in either ""Pass Mode"" or ""IF Mode"" and you get to make your selection when you build with BitCube. In Pass Mode, the output module operates with the same input value from the sensor module.
IF Mode is what makes BitCube really special. BitCube does not require any additional computer devices or software for coding. IF Mode basically does that for you by comparing the value picked up by a sensor with the value set by you in advance. When you use IF Mode, you can utilize mathematical conditions such as “greater than”, “smaller than”, and “equal to” to control when and how an output module will operate. Depending on whether the condition you set up is satisfied (True) or not satisfied (False), you can choose which value an output module will generate. All of this “programming” can be done by simply pushing and turning the knob on a BitCube.




 For example, let’s  say that you have created a smart light bulb that turns itself on when the room is dark and turns itself off when the room gets bright. If you want to make the light bulb to stay on while the room is bright, you can do that by merely setting up your own condition using IF Mode.       
 In other words, users can use IF Mode to modify conditions and follow results right away. This allows instant debugging: you can have immediate interaction with programs using your hand as an instrument.
 Although very simple, BitCube is an exceptional tool that can encourage effective learning of programming. As one can immediately be provided with numerous feedback such as movement of a motor or changing level of LED’s brightness that stimulate one’s senses, he/she can easily learn the associated algorithm.






 BitCube is a tech kit that is easy and accessible for people of all ages even without the prior knowledge of programming. With its sensor, motor, and LED, BitCube allows you to build your own unique creation. You only need creativity to pull you through. You can utilize other materials like paper, tape, and personal 3D printers to develop something of your own. It also comes with the ability to combine with LEGO, so you can also come up with ways to move your current LEGO sets!


Introduce the Bluetooth Module 
 You can also use Bluetooth with your smart device to control the sensor and output values. Or connect the two Bluetooth modules together! 


This is a bluetooth controller which is made of BitCube. We use the volume sensor here, but you can try to make something funny, using the light sensor or distance sensor, etc.


      







  We created BitCube, “The World's Most Simple Tech Kit of Sensor, Motor, and LED Controls.”
 Now on a bigger scale, what will BitCube impact? The issue BitCube is solving is in regards to STEAM education. This is a multi-dimensional curriculum featuring:
Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics. 
 Within the STEAM education curriculum, there are various times where you need to use sensors motors and LEDs. However, existing kits in the market were expensive and difficult to follow, having a pre requirement of extensive programming knowledge. BitCube is the best method that allows easiest way for children to experience STEAM education.
 We now have to remember that kids like creating, and building, and playing games. On their computers and on their smart phones. They are constantly surrounded by new programs. The lack of hands-on environment on technology is really unfortunate. Then what can we give them without the boundaries of a screen with the objective of creative construction? How do we give the kids the satisfaction when they make something on their own? Well, BitCube gives the opportunity for kids to move, collaborate, create, and develop a product without a “right or wrong” result. With BitCube’s different modules and functions that include sensor, motor, and LED, the users can connect and build like Lego while learning the fundamentals of programming logic. 
 We started in South Korea in early 2013 with a vision to make a mark in the extremely narrow-framed South Korean education system. But we vie to encourage our principle across the world. To introduce STEAM curriculum into as many educational systems around the world to enhance the next generation’s creativity and technological logic and to encourage geeks from a young age to lead them to become what they can uniquely be.
 Help BitCube complete our mission. 










 We believe that quality control is extremely important within the manufacturing process. From the manufacturing process there may be slight changes to improve the quality and design of the product, in which you will be able to receive the improved version. Please bear in mind that the item shown in the video may be slightly different from the actual item you receive.
Delivery of rewards/perks is subject to best efforts and not guaranteed.
