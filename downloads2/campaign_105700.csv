<p>By the time of launching Star Souls with crowdfunding the game is more than 50% ready. If we raise the required sum here the game will be launched in 2018. We’ve drawn most of the graphics but there’s still much work left with artificial intelligence. Besides, we want to add several features that will significantly improve and diversify the gameplay. We mostly create the game using our own resources. However, in order to complete it we need to pay the Unity developer and sound designer.</p>
<p>We’ve passed more than half of the way and we’re not going to stop. The pre-order of the game will help us bring all our ideas to life.</p>

Using various weapons you can destroy the crew of the enemy, and get his spaceship! Sometimes opponents surrender without waiting for you to incinerate them. :)Your ship is weaker than the enemy? Don’t wait until you’ll be blown up – ram hostile spaceship! Using the environment, you can cause additional damage to the enemy, pushing his spaceship to a flying asteroid or in a dangerous nebula.Smell hell on the battlefield? Take off using a Jump Drive, of course if you have some fuel... The game offers 30+ spaceships of playing races, many non-playing enemy ships and over 30 kinds of weapons. You can customize and upgrade your spaceships as well as install various modules on them.Each of your spaceships will be important during the game. By installing a specific module on the ship, you assign it a special function in your fleet.We make many different modules. Some of it improve the parameters of your ships, for example, speed up the reloading of weapons, the restoration of the shield, increase the capacity of the generator.Other modules will fundamentally change the gameplay. For example, using a transporter you can take on boarding enemies, and a giant shield, generated from a certain ship, will protect your entire fleet.You can upgrade each of your spaceships. But you won't have enought money to upgrade it all. So you should plan every step, because the dreadnought upgrade will affect your manner of the combat. The game produces story events that lead to combat, bonuses/negatives, and many number of fantastic in-game scenarios. You can choose one of three playable races. At the same the quests will be slightly different that will look at the situation from different perspectives.The action takes place in the distant future in a galaxy so old that for some inexplicable reason the stellar matter in it began to disintegrate.The galaxy is inhabited by three highly developed civilizations using a kind of ""superfuel"" to move among the stars. Due to the so-called paradox of Hirschstern none of the spaceships using the superfuel ever managed to escape from the cataclysm. It deprived all intelligent beings of the hope of salvation beyond the galaxy.Pallada, mining complex. Extraction of superfuel.""A gloomy World of swamps is the legendary second home world of Unity. Pallada which used to be so stingy with presents had given to Unity an invaluable gift – the one the native land was unable to grant. Mellow depths of the World of swamps were hiding a mystery compound which could produce tremendous power. It was from this planet that Unity began the exploration of the galaxy.""Snake-like Verdans, insect-like children of the Hive and upright walking members of the Unity – they were all trapped and filled with horror as they watched the stars die one by one destroying the exquisite multiculture that had been developing for millennia.Unity ships Deimos and Phobos. Arrival to the Pallada (artistic reconstruction).""A long time ago Unity managed to get over the conflicts and left their dying homeland for a new planet that would accommodate and feed them. Only two Unity ships arrived to Pallada. It were Deimos and Phobos.""Nobody knows who spread the rumor about the Transition – a loophole allowing to escape from the dying galaxy bypassing the paradox of Hirschstern. Driven by last hope, the governments funded the initiative to search for the Transition. Thousands of scientific and reconnaissance drones as well as hundreds of scout and military ships were sent into space. Many had disappeared, many returned unsuccessful.You are the captain of the last spaceship sent with the mission to find the Transition. The resources provided to you are extremely scarce and certainly not enough for the challenging task you are to fulfill. Let's be honest, your chances for success are very low but nothing is impossible.Stunning atmospheric Star Souls soundtrack will remind you of deep space and interstellar travel. Immerse yourself into the songs of the stars and let you carry away meet travel.This is preview compilation of the Star Souls soundtrack. Enjoy! 
Star Souls will be voiced over in English and in Russian. Particularly, we'll voice over the introduction and final videos, Galaxy News and feedback to your commands to the ships.
We have already voiced over advertising and news in the game shop. Player can find more information about the universe from it. Sometimes it's something funny, sometimes it's tragic. Star Souls soundtrack and voice-over let you feel the mood of the galaxy you travel.

Please, listen to the sample of a beautiful and flexible voice of announcer Marina Priemko.

By the time of launching Star Souls with crowdfunding the game is more than 50% ready. If we raise the required sum here the game will be launched in 2018. We’ve drawn most of the graphics but there’s still much work left with artificial intelligence. Besides, we want to add several features that will significantly improve and diversify the gameplay. We mostly create the game using our own resources. However, in order to complete it we need to pay the Unity developer and sound designer.
We’ve passed more than half of the way and we’re not going to stop. The pre-order of the game will help us bring all our ideas to life.
 

If you tried the demo, you have a question: What will we be adding between now and release?



The system of spaceships upgrading. The player will be able to improve the spaceship’s subsystems, increase some characteristics like power, hull HP, etc.- Done! please see the DEMO v.2 

Boss battles. Some of points on the star map will provide you with unique and epic boss battles to put your fleet to the test. 

Modules. You will be able to install various modules, for example transporter, boarding capsule, heavy rocket launcher, stan beam, shield regeneration accelerator and many others. An installation of modules assign a special function to the ship. 

Races. The player will be able to play on behalf of three playable races. Each has unique weapons, spaceships and quests. 

More weapons. In the game will be more additional weapons (Lasers, Gauss, Missiles etc.) and special weapons (Sensor or Engine Jammer and others). 

Star Map. We will add mini games and improve the gameplay in the star map so travelling from point to point will be much more interesting. 

Universe. In will consist of 10 galaxy sectors. Every sector is distinctive, and can be passed by many ways. We add different ways to win: capture, avoiding battles or fight with all. Every sector will have a story event which will lead to plot ending. 

In-depth tactical gameplay. It implies various elements on the battlefield which will make the gameplay more tactical – hostile nebula, black holes, teleport... 

Soundtrack. We are planning 22+ tracks. While written are only some of them but our sound designer will be working hard to give us an amazing music.

Frequently Asked Questions


What’s the release date? This is the most important question. It will be 2018. 

What platforms will the game be released? Star Souls will target the PC/Mac/Linux first with other platforms later on (Nintendo Switch, iPad). 

What languages will the game be released? Star Souls will be released in English and Russian. Translation into other languages will be done as far as possible and feasible. 

Why don’t you show what the representatives of different races look like? Because our artist doesn’t feel like drawing characters and would rather draw space and spaceships. Kidding. We just let the players stretch their imagination. 

What happens to dying stars? A star doesn’t explode in the conventional sense. Rather, it comes unraveled, leaving a gas nebula behind it. In this case all planets, naturally, die. 

Will the game be on Steam and on gog.com? Yes, Star Souls game will be on Steam and will be available through gog.com, so we will provide keys to backers who want to receive their game this way. 

When I will get rewards? Physical rewards will be sent when the game is released.",48.0,2,"1 Campaign

<td>KOYONPLETE has started uploading a new visual novel application for otomes, pursuing our desire that says, <b>“we want to create the kingdom of dreams and magic for otomes!” </b>With only a few members and only short story scenarios, we were frustrated that we could only come up with applications that would be finished so quickly. Three years after our start up, our number peers with whom we create otome games has grown steadily! We now have an engineering teams, directing teams, and etc. This time, with a team of six, we have now got to a point where we can maintain a cute and game with avatars, capsule-vending, events, and mini-games, a completely new start for KOYONPLETE.<br/>The directing is mainly handled by three girls. The illustration is done by an illustrator who is also active in Pixiv and draws magnificently as if her works were jewelry. They have played extensively every kind of otome game in Japan and<b> will deliver an otome game that is truly enjoyable for the user all over the world.</b><br/>The setting of the game is an academy of magic. Hasn't everyone wanted to try using magic, casting a staff? <b>The heroine is you. </b>Having extremely strong powers, you can use magic but you know not whether it is light or dark. Within that situation, the heroine will meet wonderful friends and companions, whilst coming face to face with her true self. Your companions are all wonderful boys each with their own unique characteristics, sprouting friendship and love rapidly between you.<br/>The first story that everyone can enjoy, about the length of a paperback, is that of a world of a magnificent magic academy. Within that story you have an avatar that is the image of you, allowing you to decorate and dress up all you want. You can collect magical items as well! <b>It has been made so that the more you play, even if it's free, you can enjoy the game endlessy.</b> Because that's the wish of the three directors of KOYONPLETE. From there on the engineering team will realize an even greater system. Every month new in depth stories and missions, mini-games, gorgeous outfits, and cute magical items will be sent in addition. Cutomize your avatar magnificently. Take snap shots, interact with friends, strengthen your magic, and enjoy new developments with boys you become friends with. You will realize that you had been woven into the grand magical world of light and dark without knowing it.<br/>We are now setting up the Japanese version. We are preparing to upload it by valentine's day next year. We are preparing the English version in tandem, but this requires an amount of translation and localization that KOYONPLETE has never had to do before. We want to enjoy the magic academy with everyone forever. Please let us upload the English version as well. Therefore we are recruiting friends that would enjoy the world of otome with us, <b>please let us KOYONPLETE provide a real otome game to everyone in the world.<br/>And please become our member. </b>Welcome to the kingdom of dreams and magic for otomes! Thank you and please help us take up our cause.

Love! Sushi Rangers -Choose your target (sushi?)!

Suddenly 6 youths appeared in the sushi kitchen, looking like people who’ve been seen somewhere before…In order to help the protagonist, they changed into humans out of being… Sushi toppings!Thus we raise our curtain on the strange life of a girl and six people(?).Can they help our protagonist hold on to the sushi shop? And what will become of her relationship with them……?!

KOYONPLETE has started uploading a new visual novel application for otomes, pursuing our desire that says, “we want to create the kingdom of dreams and magic for otomes!” With only a few members and only short story scenarios, we were frustrated that we could only come up with applications that would be finished so quickly. Three years after our start up, our number peers with whom we create otome games has grown steadily! We now have an engineering teams, directing teams, and etc. This time, with a team of six, we have now got to a point where we can maintain a cute and game with avatars, capsule-vending, events, and mini-games, a completely new start for KOYONPLETE.The directing is mainly handled by three girls. The illustration is done by an illustrator who is also active in Pixiv and draws magnificently as if her works were jewelry. They have played extensively every kind of otome game in Japan and will deliver an otome game that is truly enjoyable for the user all over the world.The setting of the game is an academy of magic. Hasn't everyone wanted to try using magic, casting a staff? The heroine is you. Having extremely strong powers, you can use magic but you know not whether it is light or dark. Within that situation, the heroine will meet wonderful friends and companions, whilst coming face to face with her true self. Your companions are all wonderful boys each with their own unique characteristics, sprouting friendship and love rapidly between you.The first story that everyone can enjoy, about the length of a paperback, is that of a world of a magnificent magic academy. Within that story you have an avatar that is the image of you, allowing you to decorate and dress up all you want. You can collect magical items as well! It has been made so that the more you play, even if it's free, you can enjoy the game endlessy. Because that's the wish of the three directors of KOYONPLETE. From there on the engineering team will realize an even greater system. Every month new in depth stories and missions, mini-games, gorgeous outfits, and cute magical items will be sent in addition. Cutomize your avatar magnificently. Take snap shots, interact with friends, strengthen your magic, and enjoy new developments with boys you become friends with. You will realize that you had been woven into the grand magical world of light and dark without knowing it.We are now setting up the Japanese version. We are preparing to upload it by valentine's day next year. We are preparing the English version in tandem, but this requires an amount of translation and localization that KOYONPLETE has never had to do before. We want to enjoy the magic academy with everyone forever. Please let us upload the English version as well. Therefore we are recruiting friends that would enjoy the world of otome with us, please let us KOYONPLETE provide a real otome game to everyone in the world.And please become our member. Welcome to the kingdom of dreams and magic for otomes! Thank you and please help us take up our cause.

KOYONPLETEは「乙女のための夢と魔法の王国を作りたい！」という思いで、乙女のためのビジュアルノベルアプリを 配信してきました。メンバーも少なく、シナリオ量も短編で、すぐ読み終わってしまうアプリしかだせていなかったのが、悔しいところでした。 起業して3年間、一緒に乙女ゲームをつくってくれる仲間がすこしずつ増えてきました！エンジニアやディレクターなど制作チームが出来ました。今回６人のチームでKOYONPLETEにとってはまったくあたらしいスタートとなる、アバターあり、ガチャあり、イベントあり、ミニゲームありのとっても可愛くてすばらしいゲームを運営していく事ができることになりました！ ディレクターはメインで3人の女の子が受け持ちます。イラストはPixivでも活躍する宝石のような色彩が特徴のイラストレータが担当します。日本のありとあらゆる乙女ゲームをやり込んで来た彼女達が ほんとうにユーザーさんに楽しんでもらえる様な乙女ゲームを初めて、世界にむけて発信します。ゲームの舞台は魔法学園。だれもが杖をふって、魔法を使ってみたいと思った事はないですか？ ヒロインは自分です。すごいパワーがあり、魔法は使えるけれども闇か光か属性がわからない。。そんな中、ヒロインは 魔法学校で、素敵な仲間と会って自分の真の姿を見いだしていきます。その仲間はみな特徴的で素敵な男の子たちで、 恋や友情がどんどんと芽生えていきます。 初めに皆さんに楽しんでもらえるのは単行本１冊くらいの大きなストーリーときらびやかで華やかな魔法学校の世界。その中には自分の分身であるアバターがあるので、自由に着せ替えも遊び放題です。魔法の小物も揃えられます！遊べば遊ぶほど、無料でもどこまでも楽しめるように作ってあります。 それがKOYONPLETEの3人のディレクター達の願いだから。。そこからさらにすばらしいシステムをエンジニアチームが実現してくれます。 一ヶ月毎に読み応えのある追加物語とミッション、ミニゲーム、さらなるゴージャスな洋服やとっても可愛い小物が追加配信されます。 自分のアバターをキラキラに着飾りましょう。 スナップショットをとったり、友達と交流したり、魔法を強化したり、仲良くなった男の子たちとのあたらしい展開をドキドキ楽しみましょう。光と闇の魔法の世界が織りなす壮大な世界にいつしか巻き込まれていることに気付くでしょう。 いまも準備中で、来年のヴァレンタインデーには配信したいと準備していますが、KOYONPLETEではいままでにやったことのないシステムの開発やイラストの量が必要です。そのためには、一定額の資金も必要となってきます。皆さんといっしょに魔法学校を永遠に楽しみたい。そこで一緒に乙女の世界を楽しむ仲間を募集します、KOYONPLETEに本当の乙女ゲームを世界の皆さんに提供させてください。そして私たちのメンバーになってください。乙女のための夢と魔法の王国にようこそ！ よろしくお願い申し上げます。

It turns out there are MANY different suppliers and versions of them and their quality varies considerably. We evaluated a dozen or more different varieties until we found the right one based on feel, responsiveness, and quality of assembly. We are confident that the model we’ve selected will provide a great gaming experience with Seedi. And for those who have a particular controller they love, no problem! Seedi is available sans controller as well.</p><p><strong>Can’t I just do this stuff on my computer?</strong></p><p>Certainly, if you want to figure that all out and play on your computer – which we do think is a great way to play!</p><p>The idea behind Seedi is to be a frustration-free way of playing your old CD and other console games on your TV.</p><p> </p><h3>More FAQs</h3><ol><li>Is this like the NES Classic or SNES Classic?

It is possible though to copy PS1 save files onto the virtual memory card.</p><ol><li value=""22"">How does Seedi make my games look good on my TV?</li></ol><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">A: Old TVs and game systems had various analog properties that resulted in a blurred picture, which made them look great, and they were designed for this environment.<br/>When you hook up your classic systems to high-definition TVs they lose a lot of these effects and end up looking weird/bad. Seedi uses a few techniques (enabled by default) to automatically correct these issues so that games look like they were supposed to.</p><ol><li value=""23"">How should I place Seedi in my room?</li></ol><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">A: Seedi can sit flat, or you can use the included stand to hold it vertically (either on the left side or right side).

You could also use your own SD card instead, or plug in a USB drive.</p><ol><li value=""27"">Is Seedi based on FPGA hardware?</li></ol><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">A: No. We have found that good old emulation is just fine :)</p><ol><li value=""28"">Is the Seedi hardware locked down (“Tivo-ized”) at all?</li></ol><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">A: No! You can repurpose the hardware for anything you want. And you can reinstall the Seedi package as well.</p><ol><li value=""29"">What's with the name?</li></ol><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">A: Phonetically it sounds like “CD” - the medium that changed the game.

We evaluated a dozen or more different varieties until we found the right one based on feel, responsiveness, and quality of assembly. We are confident that the model we’ve selected will provide a great gaming experience with Seedi. And for those who have a particular controller they love, no problem! Seedi is available sans controller as well.Can’t I just do this stuff on my computer?Certainly, if you want to figure that all out and play on your computer – which we do think is a great way to play!The idea behind Seedi is to be a frustration-free way of playing your old CD and other console games on your TV. More FAQsIs this like the NES Classic or SNES Classic? Or a hypothetical “PS1 Classic”?A: Kind of.

DOS - Games requiring a 386 processor or below should run fine
How does game saving work?A: Your game progress is saved to the main SD card. You can use traditional built-in saves, or emulator “save anywhere” - your choice.What setup will be required?A: You will be up and running in no time.-Plug the system into TV and power-Pair the included controller(s) (first time only)-Connect to WiFi-Copy over any game files you want to play*For CD based systems you must also provide a BIOS file (simple instructions included)-Have fun!What does the button on Seedi do?A: The default behavior will be to set the system to sleep, and wake it back up.What open source projects does this use?A: Front-end/media player: KodiEmulators: Various. Please read this article for the full list.OS: LinuxCD emulation: Seedi (will be open source upon launch)Is this an official product by/licensed by Sony/Sega/etc.?A: No.Does it support the PS1 multitap?A: Unfortunately no. If you want to use a bunch of PS1 controllers, what you can do though is use a USB hub with multiple PS1-USB adapters.Can I use my PS1 memory card?A: No. Seedi uses a virtual memory card. It is possible though to copy PS1 save files onto the virtual memory card.How does Seedi make my games look good on my TV?A: Old TVs and game systems had various analog properties that resulted in a blurred picture, which made them look great, and they were designed for this environment.When you hook up your classic systems to high-definition TVs they lose a lot of these effects and end up looking weird/bad. Seedi uses a few techniques (enabled by default) to automatically correct these issues so that games look like they were supposed to.How should I place Seedi in my room?A: Seedi can sit flat, or you can use the included stand to hold it vertically (either on the left side or right side).

You can also stream audio files from a NAS or other source.What output resolutions are supported?A: 720p, 1080pHow much storage space does Seedi have?A: There are 32 GBs, so you should have plenty of space to store files locally. You could also use your own SD card instead, or plug in a USB drive.Is Seedi based on FPGA hardware?A: No. We have found that good old emulation is just fine :)Is the Seedi hardware locked down (“Tivo-ized”) at all?A: No! You can repurpose the hardware for anything you want. And you can reinstall the Seedi package as well.What's with the name?A: Phonetically it sounds like “CD” - the medium that changed the game. It also represents the seed that was planted with this wave of games in the 90s.Who are these guys?A: Chris is a mechanical engineer who grew up playing NES with his mom.Bryan is a software engineer who grew up playing DOS games.Together we have 20 years of industry experience in consumer electronics and design.    Work in progress disclaimerAll preview photos/screenshots/etc on this page represent our goals for the final product - not the final product itself. Seedi is still in development so changes may be made.Open Source ComplianceSeedi is predominantly powered by a collection of free open source software.

<p>Our history begins long before <strong>Lutuen </strong>decided to hide his sunlight, which gave birth to <strong>Aven</strong> and <strong>Miona </strong>who protect our people from the darkness every night.</p>

<p>One day a man, an old man stumbled onto a magnificent site of a lake filled with a strange kind of water that was actually <strong>tears of Miona</strong>. You see Aven is very angry with Miona and every night she collides with her happiness which makes Miona very <strong>sad</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/1xOyKrQV0Y31OGkyw1/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Old man shared his discovery with people and it sparked revolution and a<strong> civilization flourished</strong>. The power it carried was not from this world so they called it <strong>magic </strong>and the magic water <strong>Mana</strong>. Centuries have passed and the Civilization became so huge that it needed to be divided in two parts with two rulers.</p>
<p>To connect two separate parts the ultimate building was built to gather all the knowledge and to teach others the magic. That was <strong>Elu Thalor</strong>.</p>
<p>All was well until one detrimental day when mad king of the south city <strong>Nopheon </strong>decided to bring <strong>Riuxxo </strong>to his Castle. Riuxxo was imprisoned in Elu Thalor because of his innovative but very sinister use of magic. Riuxxo took the power from Nopheon and after consuming the life from the whole south city, he created the ultimate evil called <strong>Barkodah</strong>.</p>
<p>It was in fact a <strong>God </strong>without physical form and though invisible you could feel it playing with your soul and talking to your mind. King Aephial of the upper city and master wizards needed to take action fast before eternal winter overcomes their land and Barkodah consumes them all. They created their God called <strong>Tehelal </strong>which was not summoned by sacrificing people but with a willpower, prayers and belief in him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the winter spread, taking lives and moral of the people. Some decided to bow to Barkodah for salvation from the cold. In order to become his army he transformed them into <strong>Bardokors </strong>which marked them forever by carrying symbols of ultimate evil, though able to endure even the cold like this.</p>
<p>The day finally came for the ultimate battle between the gods and their armies on the bridges of Elu Thalor. The might of Tehelal and Barkodahs crash was so strong that it has sent them into the sky almost touching Lutuen but it ended in an <strong>explosion </strong>leaving most of the great civilization in ruins.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">On that day no one knew what happened but their gods never returned including Riuxxo. With their cities now in ruins and with no leaders, the two distinct races <strong>Thelamos </strong>and <strong>Bardokor</strong> went separate ways to rebuild their civilizations. The land has been declared as the land of peace and honor to avoid such devastation again and the City of <strong>Amakona </strong>was built in that honor. After the city was built, everyone went their separate ways to build their civilization.</p>

Lands
 
Amakona

The holy land where civilization was born. In the right center of the land there is Mana lake which is only source of Mana and magic in the whole world.

It is a reason that whole civilization developed from simple minded ancestors to a fully developed civilization across almost whole map. Believed to be created from Mionas tears now it hides more than 2000 years old magic academy at the bottom with only a little visible peak. With only one main city Amakona it is the only peaceful land where battle between Bardokor and Thelamos is prohibited.

Even if city of Amakona was built to forget the past there are ruins of Qiramos civilization across the whole map with many evidence of ancient life.
In alpha version only a part of Amakona will be available for exploration


Vastitera

Once an unexplored peaceful land now is a place of eternal battle between two races.

Every race has its own base that they have to defend in case of enemy attack. In the center there is Bowl that maintains a protective shield for civilians and weak that happen to be in the center of the battle.

For the brave there are also a places to explore that give many opportunities.

Mythology

The sun Lutuen is considered to be the creator of everything and people mostly fear him because he is least understood of them all. When Lutuen disappears there comes the night and in the night two moons appear in the sky. They are called Aven and Miona which are considered to also fear of Lutuen but are on good nature because they light the world in the darkness.


They are true descendants of now ancient race Qiramos. Many years have passed and since then they evolved into more advanced looking races. Most of them still worship Tehelal but there are some that don’t believe in that religion anymore. As Tehelal was created by their prayer and belief most of them stayed loyal to him. Physically they can be strong as warriors but are more developed through intellect. In their kingdom to be most respected is to be of highest rank in magic, while warriors are considered to be more on the brute side.
 

Before many hundreds of years they were the ones that couldn’t bear the winter that ultimate evil Barkodah reigned. He made their hearth and body built to endure the cold and become his army. After the great separation they sailed with ships to the east, where eternal winter dwells. Because of their body transformations it was harder to cast magic so they developed more towards blood and strength. 
 

Warrior

Strength in your arms is matched to that of gods.
Your sword cuts to the bone.
Your axe smashes through stone
The Armor you carry shines so that even the King nods.
 
 
 
Rogue

You lurk in the shadows where is no light
Nor Aven nor Miona can see you in the night
There is no target that you can’t shoot with an arrow
Your blade moves faster than the eyes of sparrow
 
 
 
Mage

When Miona cries
Mana drops from her eyes
Drink her tears to get the magic might
Summon a fireball and knock down a knight
Knight may carry the strength in his arms
But the power of your spells sounds the alarms
 
 
 
Priest

You are kissed by the skies
You can heal others when Miona cries
Pray for the damned
Enchant with your hand
Equip the robe like the mage
Smash your mace with rage
 
 

Our history begins long before Lutuen decided to hide his sunlight, which gave birth to Aven and Miona who protect our people from the darkness every night.
It begins in the age when people were of the same race called Qiramos.

One day a man, an old man stumbled onto a magnificent site of a lake filled with a strange kind of water that was actually tears of Miona. You see Aven is very angry with Miona and every night she collides with her happiness which makes Miona very sad.

Old man shared his discovery with people and it sparked revolution and a civilization flourished. The power it carried was not from this world so they called it magic and the magic water Mana. Centuries have passed and the Civilization became so huge that it needed to be divided in two parts with two rulers.
To connect two separate parts the ultimate building was built to gather all the knowledge and to teach others the magic. That was Elu Thalor.
All was well until one detrimental day when mad king of the south city Nopheon decided to bring Riuxxo to his Castle. Riuxxo was imprisoned in Elu Thalor because of his innovative but very sinister use of magic. Riuxxo took the power from Nopheon and after consuming the life from the whole south city, he created the ultimate evil called Barkodah.
It was in fact a God without physical form and though invisible you could feel it playing with your soul and talking to your mind. King Aephial of the upper city and master wizards needed to take action fast before eternal winter overcomes their land and Barkodah consumes them all. They created their God called Tehelal which was not summoned by sacrificing people but with a willpower, prayers and belief in him.
Unfortunately the winter spread, taking lives and moral of the people. Some decided to bow to Barkodah for salvation from the cold. In order to become his army he transformed them into Bardokors which marked them forever by carrying symbols of ultimate evil, though able to endure even the cold like this.
The day finally came for the ultimate battle between the gods and their armies on the bridges of Elu Thalor. The might of Tehelal and Barkodahs crash was so strong that it has sent them into the sky almost touching Lutuen but it ended in an explosion leaving most of the great civilization in ruins.

On that day no one knew what happened but their gods never returned including Riuxxo. With their cities now in ruins and with no leaders, the two distinct races Thelamos and Bardokor went separate ways to rebuild their civilizations. The land has been declared as the land of peace and honor to avoid such devastation again and the City of Amakona was built in that honor. After the city was built, everyone went their separate ways to build their civilization.

2000 years have passed since then and now 2 races are ruled by kings and Teidoses with a war between them lasting for many years. Every Teidos has their problems and you have a chance to help them in their suffering and earn an honor to become Asteidus.

<p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p>While flying home from an SIA trade show in Denver, I noticed a gentleman across the aisle. His laptop barely fit on the seatback tray as he struggled to use a traditional mouse on the limited space of his laptop. Right then, the idea came to me – wouldn’t it be cool if I could control my PC functions just by moving my finger?</p>
<p>I immediately pulled out my project notebook and started drawing – and the concept for a wireless, 3-D mouse that fits on your finger was born – the Mycestro.</p>
<p>Since then, the Mycestro has been featured <a href=""http://www.cnet.com.au/mycestro-the-wearable-finger-mouse-339343585.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CNET</a>, <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/18/mycestro-is-a-3d-mouse-for-your-fingertips-that-youll-look-funny-using-but-who-cares/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Techcrunch</a>, <a href=""http://www.gizmag.com/mycestro-3d-wearable-mouse/26261/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gizmag</a>, <a href=""http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20130318/SUB1/303189991"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crains Cleveland</a>, <a href=""http://www.wired.com/design/2013/02/mycestro/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wired</a>, <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/17/mycestro-is-one-wearable-3d-ring-mouse-to-rule-them-all-video/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Engadget</a>, and many more. Also, Mycestro was selected as a semifinalist in the COSE <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUvxwWzqsY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Live Your Dream</a> contest. It also gained the honor of semifinalist at the prestigious TiEQuest, an international entrepreneurship competition.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mycestro is a 3-D mouse, which means it has the ability to track hand motion in 3-D space.</li>
<li>Mycestro is activated by your thumb. When you’re not touching the Mycestro, the cursor and cursor function pause until you begin to use it again.</li>
<li>The touch-sensitive panel initiates cursor movement. To use the Mycestro, simply touch anywhere on the panel. You can control the cursor position by moving your hand in the direction you want it to go. To make selections, release the touch panel and then tap it again on the left, middle or right button section.</li>
<li>Range: Mycestro has a range of up to 30 feet.</li>
<li>Wireless: Mycestro incorporates Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy Protocol, making it compatible with Bluetooth Smart Ready devices like iPad®3 and newer iPad Mini, iPhone® 4S and newer, iPod Touch Gen5, Apple® MacBook® Air, Mac® mini and MacBook Pro, and any PC with a compatible BLE dongle. Android devices should be available by the end of the year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Features:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mycestro is about the size of a wireless earpiece, appox 1.8 inches long.</li>
<li>Mycestro is very light, weighing .3 oz, next to nothing.</li>
<li>Its internal battery can be charged via USB.</li>
<li>Battery life is estimated to be eight hours depending on usage.</li>
<li>Two different replaceable clip sizes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHERE ARE WE</strong></p>
<p>Mycestro is a patent-pending technology. The Mycestro project was started about two years ago. Since then I have made significant product enhancements, conducted dozens of demonstrations and received publicity via Engadget and COSE, to name a few. I also have a few videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>I knew that in order to get Mycestro into the hands of consumers, I needed to enhance our corporate team and our strategic alliances with professional organizations and educational institutions. I put together a terrific management, business development, technology and strategic team and continue to strengthen our professional staff and alliances.</p>

<p>Innovative Developments, LLC has a prototype completed and is working on enhancements to its current platform. ID is looking to Indiegogo backers to help speed up the development and product delivery of the Mycestro™. The main risk in this project is delays. We're projecting an October 2013 delivery timeframe – we hope to have the Mycestro ™ in your hands before that, but we need to admit it's not a guarantee. We are very busy in reaching our goals and development and product delivery is our number one priority.

</div></div>","THE STORY
While flying home from an SIA trade show in Denver, I noticed a gentleman across the aisle. His laptop barely fit on the seatback tray as he struggled to use a traditional mouse on the limited space of his laptop. Right then, the idea came to me – wouldn’t it be cool if I could control my PC functions just by moving my finger?
I immediately pulled out my project notebook and started drawing – and the concept for a wireless, 3-D mouse that fits on your finger was born – the Mycestro.
Since then, the Mycestro has been featured CNET, Techcrunch, Gizmag, Crains Cleveland, Wired, Engadget, and many more. Also, Mycestro was selected as a semifinalist in the COSE Live Your Dream contest. It also gained the honor of semifinalist at the prestigious TiEQuest, an international entrepreneurship competition.
You can also check out these videos on YouTube: Mycestro and IPTV, Mycestro using 3D CAD, and the Mycestro Introduction.
HOW DOES IT WORK

Mycestro is a 3-D mouse, which means it has the ability to track hand motion in 3-D space.
Mycestro is activated by your thumb. When you’re not touching the Mycestro, the cursor and cursor function pause until you begin to use it again.
The touch-sensitive panel initiates cursor movement. To use the Mycestro, simply touch anywhere on the panel. You can control the cursor position by moving your hand in the direction you want it to go. To make selections, release the touch panel and then tap it again on the left, middle or right button section.
Range: Mycestro has a range of up to 30 feet.
Wireless: Mycestro incorporates Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy Protocol, making it compatible with Bluetooth Smart Ready devices like iPad®3 and newer iPad Mini, iPhone® 4S and newer, iPod Touch Gen5, Apple® MacBook® Air, Mac® mini and MacBook Pro, and any PC with a compatible BLE dongle. Android devices should be available by the end of the year.

Features:

Mycestro is about the size of a wireless earpiece, appox 1.8 inches long.
Mycestro is very light, weighing .3 oz, next to nothing.
Its internal battery can be charged via USB.
Battery life is estimated to be eight hours depending on usage.
Two different replaceable clip sizes.

WHERE ARE WE
Mycestro is a patent-pending technology. The Mycestro project was started about two years ago. Since then I have made significant product enhancements, conducted dozens of demonstrations and received publicity via Engadget and COSE, to name a few. I also have a few videos on YouTube.
I knew that in order to get Mycestro into the hands of consumers, I needed to enhance our corporate team and our strategic alliances with professional organizations and educational institutions. I put together a terrific management, business development, technology and strategic team and continue to strengthen our professional staff and alliances.
WHO ARE WE
David Greenspan, Chief Executive Officer and Director
The company is led by David Greenspan, CEO. Dave previously served as CEO for a couple of successful start-ups, COO of the PGA TOUR Radio Network, and CFO for two publicly traded companies, Exchange BLVD, Inc. and MyTurn.com, Inc., a NASDAQ-listed company. Dave has over fifteen years of experience working with emerging companies in various executive, financial and operational positions. Prior to this period, Dave's experience was with large multi-national corporations. The diversity of projects and experience in both a small, start-up environment as well as a large multi-national company environment has provided him with a unique set of skills, experiences and perspective.
(Me) Nick Mastandrea, Founder, Chief Technology Officer and Director
I have a combination of twenty-five years of experience in product design and engineering for consumer, medical and industrial products. I have been a business owner since 1999 when I started Great Lakes Engineering & Design, Inc., an engineering consulting firm. In 2003, I started MT Manufacturing, Inc., designing sunless spray tanning booths, including a proprietary revolutionary product, the VersaSpa, which became the top-selling product in the industry. I sold my interest in that company in May 2009.
I have authored/co-authored 16 patents, along with four provisional patent applications, in the last two years. I received my associate degree in electrical engineering from the Electronics Technology Institute and then went on to receive my Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Cleveland State University.
Anthony Crisalli, Director
Mr. Crisalli is a results-driven financial services executive with a successful track record of delivering rapid and sustainable revenue growth in the commercial, middle‐market and institutional sectors. He was responsible for building and managing a diverse group of businesses within financial services including capital markets, commercial and investment banking, and venture capital/private equity. Anthony’s operating/transaction experience includes financial modeling, budgeting and planning, equity and debt financing, risk management, cash management and financial reporting.
Michael Finn, Director
Mr. Finn has been an adviser to the company since 2011, bringing more than 30 years of experience in venture capital, private equity, mergers and acquisitions, and institutional investment to the project. He is a seasoned investment executive with extensive experience building private and public companies and has served as a corporate director for more than 35 companies. Mr. Finn’s areas of expertise include manufacturing, software, staffing, technology, health care and financial services.
Stephen Chiles
Mr. Chiles is a successful business leader with a focus on building high-impact programs and cross-functional teams that heavily leverage digital marketing and emerging cloud technologies to drive significant revenue growth. He has built critical marketing, sales and operational value in key C-level roles within the Internet start-up space with ShareFile, acquired by Citrix in 2011; Insurance.com, acquired by Quinstreet in 2010; and Reprise Media, acquired by The Interpublic Group in 2007. Prior to Mr. Chiles’ experience with Internet start-ups, he held a variety of interactive marketing leadership roles at AOL during the birth and subsequent growth of marketing on the Web, as we know it today.
WHAT’S LEFT TO DO
My goal is to make Mycestro as compatible as possible for the ever-growing number of laptops, tablets, smartphones and PCs in the marketplace. I have spent more than a year preparing to launch Mycestro on Indiegogo to ensure that you, our backers, are completely satisfied with the product and are completely confident that we can deliver. I have a working prototype with finalized housing and electronics designs. The packaging is being finalized – and Dave and I have finalized distribution, warehousing, manufacturing, testing and customer service plans.
WE NEED YOU
Your support will go toward all efforts to manufacture Mycestro. Donations generated on Indiegogo will help fund plastic injection mold tooling, a preproduction prototype run of the electronics, and a pilot run for manufacturing complete units, testing and packaging. We are committed to getting Mycestro into production as quickly as possible, with an estimated release date between October and November 2013.

you view the action from a top down perspective and control Inkuns movements by tilting the tablet in the direction you want him to go and he will react in the way that you would expect a droplet of Ink to.

He will attack any cretin in range and in the direction that he is facing, some times even when moving.
 
He will have special powers and abilities which you can activate through the touch screen
Abilities such as:


flicking Inkun through a crowd of Cretins


raining ink down on to a section of the paper

<p>We are a small team that are passionate about gaming and great artwork. This is the first of (hopefully) many games that we will create by merging those two passions.

We have also added <a href=""http://instagram.com/hartdaplag"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Matthew Lapierre"">Matthew Lapierre</a> to our art team. In addition, all of our awesome campaign artwork and the framed perk rewards were created by the incredibly talented <a href=""http://jonathanpowell.daportfolio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Jonathan Powell"">Jonathan Powell</a>. Unfortunately, as a small start-up style group we don’t have the funds to match our enthusiasm. Which is where you come in!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to be able to add amazing artwork to the card game, Story Builder, and then be able to distribute it to every gamer who wants to play. Towards that end we are asking for $45,000, which breaks down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$25,000 for artwork</li>
<li>$15,000 for the initial manufacturing run</li>
<li>$5,000 for distribution and marketing costs.</li>
</ul><p>The cost of the artwork is the lion’s share of the money we are asking for because we feel that the way to make an amazing game is to make it <strong>look</strong> as amazing as it plays! Which is why we don’t want to skimp when it comes to paying our artists.</p>
<p>If we are able to surpass the $45,000 goal then the money will be used to fund the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a second, non-exclusive, expansion pack</li>
<li>Covering future, and on-going, manufacturing</li>
<li>Hiring our team full time to work on future new games (and expansions).</li>
</ul><p>For more details, check out Stretch Goals &amp; Rewards lower down the page.</p>
<p>We’ve opted for a Fixed Funding style campaign because while we truly believe that this is a great game and want to see it get made, we won't be able to realize that dream without your help.</p>
<p> </p>

It is intended for keepers and gamers, but I hope all Lovecraft enthusiasts and amateurs of weird artefacts will find it intriguing. It could indeed have a place in a cabinet of curiosities. </p><p>The Simulacrum is different from others Mythos sculpture : it doesn't represent an Elder God or a alien creature, but a human form that must evoke both terror and strangeness. Since it is supposed to be the very first human-shaped sculpture ever created, maybe even before humanity was even born, it should stem from some ancient civilisations, without being specific to any of them. </p><p></p><p>The sculpture of the Sedefkar Simulacrum will be cast in polyurethane, when assembled its size will be a respectable 37 centimeters long (1.2 foot), if it was smaller, it would not seem as threatening as it should. Once it will be cast in Greece, it will be hand-painted by myself - Delphes. <b>Each sculpture will be unique. </b>I have worked very hard to find how to paint the simulacrum in a way that matches the description given in the books : a changing color ""according to strength of the light bathing it"", I will use a traditional technique where I apply successive layers of fine pigments. It increases the colors effects in the patina, so the material looks like metal and copper and wood and ceramic.  With your investment you will offer yourself an unique artefact, made in a traditional process.</p><p></p><p>It will be composed of six parts (head, legs, arms and torso) that can be assembled by <b>a clever magnetic system</b> (our caster team in Athens found a great way to do it, and it works) so when assembled it will look like a reduced model of the real thing.</p><p>Did you ever had the chance to play with a <b>real sculpture </b>which had a central part in your game ?

Hi ! My name is Delphes. 
I am a visual artist, and i graduated in Sculpture from The Fine Arts school of Paris. I have been acquainted with the Lovecraft mythos since I have met my life-partner, 12 years ago. For a Long time now, i have helped him to create props for his role-playing games. Now I would like to use my classical training to create a very special prop for Horror on the Orient Express.Two other people have worked with me on this project :Remy Gente is a 30 years old filmmaker and art director. He has created the Sedefkar Simulacrum project logo you can see above and worked with his group of film director (Bruno Cailloux and Bertrand Cazor) Black Hive to create the video presentation.You can read his complete presentation on his website.Rezvan Farsijani is a stylist and Iranian researcher living in Paris. She worked as a stylist for several luxuary brands. She has studied Persian miniature, and she will be in charge of the Sedefkar scroll.If you have any question about this project, leave a comment, you can also join us on facebook or mail us at sedefkarsimulacrum@gmail.com.About the SimulacrumThe Sedefkar Simulacrum is a prop, licensed by Chaosium, for the Call of Cthulhu Campaign : Horror on the Orient Express. It is intended for keepers and gamers, but I hope all Lovecraft enthusiasts and amateurs of weird artefacts will find it intriguing. It could indeed have a place in a cabinet of curiosities. The Simulacrum is different from others Mythos sculpture : it doesn't represent an Elder God or a alien creature, but a human form that must evoke both terror and strangeness. Since it is supposed to be the very first human-shaped sculpture ever created, maybe even before humanity was even born, it should stem from some ancient civilisations, without being specific to any of them. The sculpture of the Sedefkar Simulacrum will be cast in polyurethane, when assembled its size will be a respectable 37 centimeters long (1.2 foot), if it was smaller, it would not seem as threatening as it should. Once it will be cast in Greece, it will be hand-painted by myself - Delphes. Each sculpture will be unique. I have worked very hard to find how to paint the simulacrum in a way that matches the description given in the books : a changing color ""according to strength of the light bathing it"", I will use a traditional technique where I apply successive layers of fine pigments. It increases the colors effects in the patina, so the material looks like metal and copper and wood and ceramic.  With your investment you will offer yourself an unique artefact, made in a traditional process.It will be composed of six parts (head, legs, arms and torso) that can be assembled by a clever magnetic system (our caster team in Athens found a great way to do it, and it works) so when assembled it will look like a reduced model of the real thing.Did you ever had the chance to play with a real sculpture which had a central part in your game ? With your support and assistance, it will be the first time ever a sculpture is commercialized for a role playing campaign.So FarI have already work long and hard to produce several sculptures until I found one satisfying enough to present it, one which, despite its manageable reduced size would look like a perfect replica of a far greater sculpture. Then based on one of them, the caster's team in Athens has created several prototype with different assemblage systems, until they found a magnetic one. I am currently always working on another version of the sculpture to see what I can improve.Here, you can watch how the magnetic assemblage works on a prototype made in polyurethane (without finish and painting - the final magnet won't be silver shiny) : The PledgesHere are the details on the various pledges proposed :PdfThe pdf of the seven pictures of the Simulacrum, a postcard from the Louvres (see below under Pictures), and an excerpt from the Scroll of the Head, six pictures will figure a part of the Simulacrum with a background figuring the city where it was found, and one picture will allow your players to contemplate the whole simulacrum in its horrifying glory. It will be designed by Remy Gente. PosterThis poster will be 70x100 cm, it will be designed as a movie poster with the title ""Horror on the Orient Express"". Your players will know they are about to have a cinematic experience when they will see this prop designed by Remy Gente. PicturesAll the pictures from the pdf will be professionally printed and cut for you to emulate 1920's postcards, all presented in a special envelope. You will have a picture of each part of the Simulacrum, and a picture of the whole simulacrum. It won't be like having a real sculpture for your players. But for those who can't afford the sculpture, it will be a good alternative to the original prop. In complement to the sculpture, it will be helpful to your player (easy to manipulate or place on a map).[Update - Spoiler] You will also receive a postcard the player characters can buy if they visit the Louvres during the Paris adventure. The postcard design will be based on real 1920s postcards from the Louvres, and it will represent the XVIIIth century portrait of a certain nobleman with connections to the simulacrum history…SculptureThe sculpture of the Sedefkar Simulacrum will be composed of six parts (head, torso, legs and arms), all cast in polyurethane and hand painted. The different parts can be assembled with a magnetic device. BoxThe sedfkar simulacrum will be presented in a box specially made in strong cardboard and decorated with labels.Scroll of the HeadThe scroll of the Head will be more than 20cm wide and 1m long, and it will depict half of the Scroll (with 11 pictures and 25 illuminated Arabic words). It will be printed in both sides, in color, on a special paper (human skin is unavailable). The background will try to emulate the color and feel of different tanned piece of human skins stitched together.Supplementary HeadThe Sedefkar Simulacrum is supposed to remind you of your own features when you look at it. Some of you will be able to purchase supplementary heads, with faces that look like your character or anyone you deem fit, even yourself. If you do such an order, I will contact you to ask for pictures of the face you want on your order.
Life-size Sulpture
If your really love this project and weird scuplture, you can purchase the Sedefkar Simulacrum on a 1:1 scale. It will be 150cm (5 ft tall) when assembled : six pieces, with lugs and corresponding slots for the piece to fit together. It will be cast in polyurethane in Greece and painted by hand. I intend to follow the description of the book concerning the texture of each members « examined closely, perhaps through a magnifying glass or other optical aid, small repeating forms of the segment can be seen to make up a surface design on each segment, as though etched. Thus the head is shaped of tiny heads, the right arm of tiny repeated right arms and so on. » I will use tiny casts to print the small forms on the surface. You can choose the face you want (I will need pictures).

<h1>The RETRO VGS Console</h1>
<div>If you look closely you might notice something familiar about the appearance of RETRO VGS. In a move that saved our team considerable start-up capital we purchased and took ownership of the original mold tooling Atari used to create the Atari Jaguar in the early 1990's.  This tooling is still in exceptional condition and able to create high quality, polycarbonate parts to this very day.  We are repurposing this tooling to create the RETRO VGS console and cartridge shells, with slight modifications.<p></p>

<p>RETRO VGS allows you to play new games using USB controllers, classic controllers, or both.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>The RETRO VGS USB Controller</h2></figure><p>The RETRO VGS controller is designed to have the best of both worlds. From modern day controllers come responsive dual-analog sticks and shoulder buttons combined with the all familiar and loved classically-inspired D-pad and correctly oriented buttons. Developers will have a multitude of game and player control options to tap into. RETRO VGS will utilize its own USB controllers but gamers will also have the option to plug in their other favorite USB controllers and devices, even a keyboard!</p>

<h1><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 40px; letter-spacing: 1px; font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;"">Stretch Goals</span></h1>
<p></p>
<p>At our minimum goal of $1,950,000, RETRO VGS comes to life and will play a wide variety of fun, high-quality games.  After that, the more success our campaign receives, the more we put into RETRO VGS.</p>
<div></div>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'><br/></span></p>
<h1><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 38px; letter-spacing: 1px; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;"">Unprecedented Flexibility</span></h1>
<p>At $3,100,000—about 60% more than our minimum goal—we increase the size of our FPGA, making RETRO VGS the first video game system capable of recreating classic systems through reshaping its own hardware!<br/><br/> At $3,800,000—less than twice our minimum goal—we increase the size of our FPGA again, nearly doubling its size from the previous goal.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">What is an FPGA?</span></h2>
<p>A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a large integrated circuit with an array of many logic gates that can be connected together to perform parallel and sequential functions by programming bits in random-access memory (RAM). An FPGA is similar in structure to common “standard cell” digital application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) which are programmed when they are created through a pattern in what are essentially bits in masked read-only memory (ROM).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;'>More Gates = More Variety + More Fun</span></h2>
<p>Using a larger FPGA allows game developers to extend the ability of RETRO VGS in the same way that on-cartridge enhancement chips (ASICs) extended the ability of the Super Nintendo, but on a much larger scale and at much lower cost to game makers and buyers.</p>
<p>The larger FPGA will give RETRO VGS enough gates to duplicate the circuits of entire classic video game and computer systems.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h1>Use of Funds</h1>
<p>At our minimum goal amount, more than two-thirds of funds raised will be used to manufacture contributors’ rewards.</p>
<p>As stretch goals are reached, the proportion of funds used to manufacture contributors’ rewards grows larger.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442611846/qomctz1pdchp5pp1bqze.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1>The RETRO VGS Story</h1>
<p>It was about 2 years ago when I had an idea for a new game system to run off ""modern day"" cartridges.  I had discussions with colleagues about this idea and eventually was hooked up with game industry alum, Steve Woita.  Steve has a long career in gaming beginning with his games developed for Atari 2600, which included TAZ and Atari's first and only game with voice, QUADRUN.  After Atari, Steve continued his career developing games for both Sega and Nintendo NES.  His titles there include:  Kid Chameleon, Sonic Spinball and Sonic 2.  And for Tengen on NES, Super Sprint and unrealesed Police Academy.   You can read more about <a href=""https://stevewoita.wordpress.com/games/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steve's work here</a>.   Steve and I have been working on this concept ever since.</p>
<p>It wasn't until E3 2014 when I knew the time was drawing near for a venture like this. I was walking the E3 floor and noticed that Sony and Microsoft had invited various indie developers into their pricey booth space to show off their creations.  And most of these games were all retro style, influenced games.  I saw the mainstream industry now taking notice of these developers and these style games.  Retro gaming is now become a genre and an art form!  I thought it was a shame, however, these games were going to be relegated only to digital downloads.  These games should have the chance to survive and live long into the future, not be tossed aside like so many games these days once the ""newness"" has worn off.   Some games deserve to be preserved and there is no modern day console that will do this.  And, in fact, as new generations of consoles have been introduced they are separating gamers even further from their games.</p>
<p>It was about this same time I had learned the Atari Jaguar molds were put up for auction on eBay.  I discovered they hadn't sold and were still around and located at a dental instrument manufacturer who had originally bought them from Atari in a late 90's liquidation.  I quickly called them up, confirmed they still had them and drove up to Northern California to see them in person.  This trip was the beginning of this venture becoming reality and is the reason this campaign is running.  To make a long story short, I ended up purchasing the Atari Jaguar tooling from Imagin Systems and have since relocated them where we will be manufacturing RETRO VGS, here in Southern California.  Once we had the tooling delivered to their new home (a local injection molding company) <a href=""http://www.retrovgs.com/media.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">we set up and tested the parts and were amazed to discover they still produce top quality polycarbonate parts</a>.  So far so good!</p>

<div>Since we had a significant part of this venture decided, the look of the console and the tooling to make it, we then focused on the hardware.  Now this process doesn't happen fast and we've gone through a few different design iterations.  At one point, Steve began considering using an FPGA to give RETRO VGS some interesting application and it is an idea we have stuck with ever since and will continue to stick with pending the outcome of this campaign and its achieved funding.  It was in March of 2015 we discovered a diamond in the rough, John Carlsen.  And as luck would have it, he was available to work on this with us and also somewhat local to Southern California.  John is a gaming hardware guru having worked intimately on both the software and hardware side of the console business for his entire career. For Sony, John developed a small Playstation for emerging foreign markets.  Earlier, John was a co-founder of Iguana Entertainment and worked his magic there to create a low-cost development systems for the Super NES and other cartridge gaming consoles.  John also worked for Altera, one of the top FPGA makers.  Yes, this all comes full circle and the stars aligned.<p></p>

<i>Steve Woita, Mike Kennedy &amp; John Carlsen</i><p></p>
<p>As of today, we've literally done everything we can do up to this point before preparing for the costly prototyping phase. We've confirmed the appearance of the RETRO VGS console and cartridges and have purchased the tooling to create and produce mass quantities of these parts. We are working with a third party controller manufacturer to supply us with branded USB controllers and we have working prototypes in hand that are testing out great.  We have designed the system architecture and circuit design and have established solid relationships with the largest (and local) electronics distributors and suppliers in the area.  We have spec'ed out all electronics and parts and are proud to say we are using only the best parts available in RETRO VGS. Finally, we have established a relationship with one of the largest PCBA contract manufacturers in the area. All the pieces are in place to create a working prototype soon after it appears our funding goal will be met.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we have had significant outreach from over 150 developers all interested in bringing games onto RETRO VGS.  Most saying they never thought a chance to have their games on cartridges would never happen.  We also have inroads to the mainstream gaming developers and publishers and believe that if we can prove there is still a solid market for ""new"" cartridge based games, then they will be happy to bring their big name, legacy games onto the system.  We now need all of you to show them there is a market and that you want to see some of their franchises brought back to life on RETRO VGS.</p>
<p>Help us bring cartridges back!  Cartridges are a medium that brings gaming back and gaming culture back to its roots and it can all happen on RETRO VGS.  We ask for your support and are confident we can deliver to you all in 2016, a brand new, high-quality and state-of-the-art cartridge based video game system that will be fun to play for years to come.</p>

</div></div>","We are gamers, and seasoned industry professionals who have    dedicated our careers to making great video games. We know first    hand what it takes to get the major bugs out of games before they    are released, and that player’s should never need to download and    install system updates and game patches.    Network-dependent game consoles rob us of time we want to spend    playing, and sometimes the ability to play games we own just because    they aren’t compatible with the latest updates or they can’t connect    to a distant or decommissioned server.    Together, we can create a great new video game system built on the    old ideas that games shouldn’t waste our time start playing quickly,    never need patches or system updates, and be playable for as many    years as we like.

      Together, we can bring RETRO VGS to life.








Meet RETRO VGS
    RETRO VGS is the first new video game system to play new games from    cartridges in nearly twenty years.    RETRO VGS games start quickly and are thoroughly tested before they    are released, so you never need to download and apply software    patches. Unlike downloadable games, cartridge games are stored on    their own media and can be collected, traded, and resold.    Through its cartridge slot and standard USB interface for    controllers and other devices, RETRO VGS functionality can be    extended without ever needing a system update.


Take Gaming Back to its Roots

Never patch a game. Games are tested thoroughly before release, just like they used to be.
Never update your system or risk turning it in to a brick. Your console stays factory fresh.
No network connection or game server(s) required. Never fear of your favorite game will get pulled and shut down!
No hidden costs from downloadable or streaming content.




RETRO VGS is All About Games! 
As we have learned over the years, a console is only as good as the games that can be played on it.  So we have spent a considerable amount of time outlining launch games we feel will be universally enjoyed by retro gamers and have negotiated with these developers to make their games available for launch on RETRO VGS. 

The Adventures of Tiny Knight

Everyone will receive the pack-in game,  The Adventures of Tiny Knight from CollectorVision Games as part of their RETRO VGS system purchase here.  If you loved games like Super Mario, Wonder Boy and Mega Man you will be in for a real treat taking the role of Sir Basset, the Tiny Knight as he sets out to save the Princess from the clutches of the evil dragon.  It will also feature a campaign only ""Knighted"" silver cartridge shell.

The RETRO VGS Console
If you look closely you might notice something familiar about the appearance of RETRO VGS. In a move that saved our team considerable start-up capital we purchased and took ownership of the original mold tooling Atari used to create the Atari Jaguar in the early 1990's.  This tooling is still in exceptional condition and able to create high quality, polycarbonate parts to this very day.  We are repurposing this tooling to create the RETRO VGS console and cartridge shells, with slight modifications.
 



What's Included

Included with each RETRO VGS game console:

Pack-in game cartridge: The Adventures of Tiny Knight in an exclusive campaign only ""Knighted"" silver cartridge shell
1 RETRO VGS USB game controller
Digital A/V cable (HDMI)
Analog A/V cable (RCA triple)
Power adapter (with input and plug for destination nation, unless otherwise requested)



Free Digital Magazine Subscription




All backers will also receive a free 1-Year Digital Subscription ($18 Value - contact us to upgrade your subscription to PRINT) to RETRO Video Game Magazine. Just like back in the day, you will get a magazine that complements the console. It will feature previews of upcoming RETRO VGS games including developer liner notes and interviews and game concept art. It's all part of bringing back the culture of gaming! Check out previews of back issues on the ShopReadRETRO Website!




RETRO VGS Controller Flexibility
RETRO VGS allows you to play new games using USB controllers, classic controllers, or both.

The RETRO VGS USB ControllerThe RETRO VGS controller is designed to have the best of both worlds. From modern day controllers come responsive dual-analog sticks and shoulder buttons combined with the all familiar and loved classically-inspired D-pad and correctly oriented buttons. Developers will have a multitude of game and player control options to tap into. RETRO VGS will utilize its own USB controllers but gamers will also have the option to plug in their other favorite USB controllers and devices, even a keyboard!

Here is an actual working controller prototype playing through a demo level of Adventures of Tiny Knight.
                             RETRO VGS USB controllers are available individually or may be added to your console perk for $25 each.

9-Pin Classic Controller Interface
In addition to offering USB controller options, RETRO VGS allows you to play new games using a wide variety of classic 9-pin controllers including joysticks, paddles, spinners, trackballs, and more.



Exclusive Campaign Colors


To celebrate the launch of RETRO VGS here on Indiegogo we are offering exclusive console colors only for our Indiegogo campaign backers.  These will never be produced in these color combinations ever again and will add considerable value to these consoles purchased here on Indiegogo.
** If you back at one of these exclusive color levels you will be asked at the conclusion of the campaign to confirm your desired color **

Our Goal


Our primary goal is to deliver the most fun to the most people for as many years as we can.


Bringing a big state-of-the-art product like this to market is an expensive process, and we have already personally invested all the time and money we can. Now we need your contribution to build a fun, long-lasting video game system—and one that you’ll be among the first to play!

Our Progress to Date

After we determined what we want RETRO VGS to do, we did our homework.  We now know what we want to build, how much it will cost, and how long it will take.

Stretch Goals

At our minimum goal of $1,950,000, RETRO VGS comes to life and will play a wide variety of fun, high-quality games.  After that, the more success our campaign receives, the more we put into RETRO VGS.


Unprecedented Flexibility
At $3,100,000—about 60% more than our minimum goal—we increase the size of our FPGA, making RETRO VGS the first video game system capable of recreating classic systems through reshaping its own hardware! At $3,800,000—less than twice our minimum goal—we increase the size of our FPGA again, nearly doubling its size from the previous goal.

What is an FPGA?
A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a large integrated circuit with an array of many logic gates that can be connected together to perform parallel and sequential functions by programming bits in random-access memory (RAM). An FPGA is similar in structure to common “standard cell” digital application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) which are programmed when they are created through a pattern in what are essentially bits in masked read-only memory (ROM).

More Gates = More Variety + More Fun
Using a larger FPGA allows game developers to extend the ability of RETRO VGS in the same way that on-cartridge enhancement chips (ASICs) extended the ability of the Super Nintendo, but on a much larger scale and at much lower cost to game makers and buyers.
The larger FPGA will give RETRO VGS enough gates to duplicate the circuits of entire classic video game and computer systems.


Use of Funds
At our minimum goal amount, more than two-thirds of funds raised will be used to manufacture contributors’ rewards.
As stretch goals are reached, the proportion of funds used to manufacture contributors’ rewards grows larger.

The remaining portion (the small gray piece) will be used to complete developing our design into a highly-polished, marketable consumer product.  This pays for everything from building and testing prototypes through the international regulatory certification process, including:



Stipends (including benefits, payroll tax, etc.)—only about half of normal wages, but enough to afford to do this full time (8-12% of minimum goal)


Creating prototype circuit assemblies—from where we are today through regulatory certification, including pre-release systems for developers of launch titles (5% of min. goal)


Outsourcing software development (5% of min. goal)


Testing and certifying regulatory compliance (4% of min. goal)


Renting space and equipment for a small office and lab (4% of min. goal)


Advertising (2% of min. goal)


All other operating expenses (1% of min. goal)

We are working with a third party controller manufacturer to supply us with branded USB controllers and we have working prototypes in hand that are testing out great.  We have designed the system architecture and circuit design and have established solid relationships with the largest (and local) electronics distributors and suppliers in the area.  We have spec'ed out all electronics and parts and are proud to say we are using only the best parts available in RETRO VGS. Finally, we have established a relationship with one of the largest PCBA contract manufacturers in the area. All the pieces are in place to create a working prototype soon after it appears our funding goal will be met.
Thankfully, we have had significant outreach from over 150 developers all interested in bringing games onto RETRO VGS.  Most saying they never thought a chance to have their games on cartridges would never happen.  We also have inroads to the mainstream gaming developers and publishers and believe that if we can prove there is still a solid market for ""new"" cartridge based games, then they will be happy to bring their big name, legacy games onto the system.  We now need all of you to show them there is a market and that you want to see some of their franchises brought back to life on RETRO VGS.
Help us bring cartridges back!  Cartridges are a medium that brings gaming back and gaming culture back to its roots and it can all happen on RETRO VGS.  We ask for your support and are confident we can deliver to you all in 2016, a brand new, high-quality and state-of-the-art cartridge based video game system that will be fun to play for years to come.

<p><span>Vision is a unique social game hub for indie gamers. It allows developers to deploy their indie game on a platform where normal people who love indie games can download it for free. With Vision we aim to bring a fantastic indie gaming experience back to the desktop, and properly allow PC gamers to use a controller for games. If they want to, of course, we have support for keyboard input as well, Vision is all about choice and running your games how you want to.</span></p>
<p>But what’s the catch? The catch is that there isn’t a catch. It’s free of charge to download the core software, and all content from the store will be free.</p>
<p>We will ship no bloatware with Vision, and it will be snappy. We’ve limited our use of animations, so that the when you press a button - you get what you want. Fast.</p>
<p>It’s beautiful - the home screen is simply amazing. Don’t like it? Download a theme from the Vision store and change it up so it’s perfect for you. Don’t like any of the store ones? Make your own and upload it for free! That’s the thing about Vision - it’s not closed. We want you to make it your own. You can tweak and customise almost every aspect of the system so it’s just the way you like it. Because at the end of the day, it’s not just our Vision - it’s yours.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What can I run it on, I hear you ask? I guess it’d be simpler to ask what you can’t run it on. The prototype runs on the 3 main operating system’s - Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. However, we have plans for a modified version of Gentoo, which will run Vision on top of it. Which means Vision practically is the operating system. It’ll load up almost instantly, and run blazingly fast on almost any hardware. Perfect if you’ve got an old PC lying around unused, and want to turn it into your own gaming console. We will also allow you to create a bootable USB drive, so you can take Vision with you wherever you go. We also are planning to compile this to run on ARM devices, which means you would see a version of Vision for very low end hardware such as the Raspberry Pi. Hook it up to your television, plug in a controller, and voila, you can enjoy brilliant indie games on a flat screen television!</span></p>
<p>Android support could also be possible, but this really does depend on how the kickstarter goes.</p>
<p>But what features does Vision have?</p>
<p>Panes. The home screen of Vision contains something we call panes - they are large icons, which launch you into apps. They’re beautiful. There are 4 of them on each page. Vision comes with the most important apps pinned - Apps, Games, System and Friends. When you go into Apps or Games, you will have the ability to pin either of these as a pane on your home screen, creating multiple pages of panes. So you can get to the things that matter to you most - quickly.<br/></p>

<p>Vision Store. This is where you’ll find all the indie apps and games that can run on Vision. Each week we’ll pick the top featured apps and put them up front. We’ll also have a most downloaded apps section, where you can check out. When an app is sent to us, we’ll verify that it’s not a virus, contains no bloatware or malware, and do brief quality control before it’s allowed onto the store. The store will also contain themes, so you can theme Vision to your hearts content.</p>

<p>Vision Central. This is a place where you can access all your notifications, and it shows off the time and date as well. We also will have widget support here, so you can see the things most important to you at a quick glance - be it the weather, or latest sports results, etc.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Notifications. Any app can send out a notification, if you allow it too on the first boot, meaning that you can always keep up to date.</p>
<p>Social Services Integration. Vision will connect with your social networks, and then from that it will be able to give you notifications and a feed on all updates.</p>

<br/></div>","Vision is a unique social game hub for indie gamers. It allows developers to deploy their indie game on a platform where normal people who love indie games can download it for free. With Vision we aim to bring a fantastic indie gaming experience back to the desktop, and properly allow PC gamers to use a controller for games. If they want to, of course, we have support for keyboard input as well, Vision is all about choice and running your games how you want to.
But what’s the catch? The catch is that there isn’t a catch. It’s free of charge to download the core software, and all content from the store will be free.
We will ship no bloatware with Vision, and it will be snappy. We’ve limited our use of animations, so that the when you press a button - you get what you want. Fast.
It’s beautiful - the home screen is simply amazing. Don’t like it? Download a theme from the Vision store and change it up so it’s perfect for you. Don’t like any of the store ones? Make your own and upload it for free! That’s the thing about Vision - it’s not closed. We want you to make it your own. You can tweak and customise almost every aspect of the system so it’s just the way you like it. Because at the end of the day, it’s not just our Vision - it’s yours.
What can I run it on, I hear you ask? I guess it’d be simpler to ask what you can’t run it on. The prototype runs on the 3 main operating system’s - Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. However, we have plans for a modified version of Gentoo, which will run Vision on top of it. Which means Vision practically is the operating system. It’ll load up almost instantly, and run blazingly fast on almost any hardware. Perfect if you’ve got an old PC lying around unused, and want to turn it into your own gaming console. We will also allow you to create a bootable USB drive, so you can take Vision with you wherever you go. We also are planning to compile this to run on ARM devices, which means you would see a version of Vision for very low end hardware such as the Raspberry Pi. Hook it up to your television, plug in a controller, and voila, you can enjoy brilliant indie games on a flat screen television!
Android support could also be possible, but this really does depend on how the kickstarter goes.
But what features does Vision have?
Panes. The home screen of Vision contains something we call panes - they are large icons, which launch you into apps. They’re beautiful. There are 4 of them on each page. Vision comes with the most important apps pinned - Apps, Games, System and Friends. When you go into Apps or Games, you will have the ability to pin either of these as a pane on your home screen, creating multiple pages of panes. So you can get to the things that matter to you most - quickly.


Vision Store. This is where you’ll find all the indie apps and games that can run on Vision. Each week we’ll pick the top featured apps and put them up front. We’ll also have a most downloaded apps section, where you can check out. When an app is sent to us, we’ll verify that it’s not a virus, contains no bloatware or malware, and do brief quality control before it’s allowed onto the store. The store will also contain themes, so you can theme Vision to your hearts content.


Vision Central. This is a place where you can access all your notifications, and it shows off the time and date as well. We also will have widget support here, so you can see the things most important to you at a quick glance - be it the weather, or latest sports results, etc.


Vision Voice. Our own voice control system. You’ll be able to tell it to do things such as launch apps, message your friends, etc.


Notifications. Any app can send out a notification, if you allow it too on the first boot, meaning that you can always keep up to date.
Social Services Integration. Vision will connect with your social networks, and then from that it will be able to give you notifications and a feed on all updates.
Automatic updater . On boot, Vision checks that it is running the latest version, and if it isn’t, it’ll automatically update - you’ll always be on the latest version of Vision.


It’ll come with the default apps you’d expect from an application such as this - a music and videos player, and things such as a web browser.
If you’re a developer interested in Vision, then you’ll be happy to know that there is an SDK on the way, built around LWJGL and Slick2D. We really didn’t change much of the Slick2D API, so you can start developing your Vision Games and Applications as Slick2D StateBasedGames, until we get back to you on the position of the API.

<p>Time Rift started as my end-of-year school project. As I started to work on it, I realized that I would need more people to get it done in time. I recruited my best friends, Michael, Eric, and Mo. We started to make the game, and realized that we needed globs of money. a lot more than we had. It was then that Michael suggested Kickstarter and when that didn't work, he suggested indiegogo! Now here we are, a official company, with a real game! I hope you decide to fund us, and thank you in advance!</p>

<h3>About the game</h3>
<p>   Time Rift is a Cross between a Role Playing Game (RPG), like Skyrim, and a rougelike game, like Faster Than Light. In the game, you are a Time Traveling Hero aided by a wizard, protecting time from a evil force! The Timelines that you travel to are randomly selected from a huge pool of them, and the loot works on the same concept. We have Timelines ranging from when King Arthur and his knights were going around questing, to the far future, where there is no difference between man and machine!</p>
</div>
<h3 class=""dotty""><span>Risks and challenges</span></h3>
<p>The obstacles we have found are mainly that we are all underage, so our parents have to run this stuff. There is also the fact that this is our first game, so you may think we won't make a good one. However, we will respond to community feedback, and have many people to help us make Time Rift a game for the ages!</p>

<p>Everworld Island is a coop Sandbox
Multiplayer game, that can be played both, Online or over LAN with up
to 4 Players. The most unique features in this game are the Campaign
and Level editor,which allows you to create, share and play levels,
campaigns or stories with your friends or with people from all over
the world without any programming knowledge. There will also be a
variety of classes, like the Mage,Knight,Mechanic,Diver. Each Class
has their own abilities, the Diver for example, will be able to swim,
and dive for treasures or hidden secrets.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There will also be a wide range of
items that can be found and collected in the levels, like Potions,
Treasure Maps, rare items that can be placed in your home for others
to see.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Day/Night cycle within the game
will allow more variety in your levels. For example some encounters
are only triggered during a specific daytime, like ghosts, and some
secrets rooms are only active at night, while plant like enemies are
only active during the day.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/82413/files/20130918133900-2.jpg?1379536740"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p>
<br/><p>
</p>
<p><b>Why do we need the money?</b></p>
<p>There are quite a few features already
in the game, but some are missing completely, just to name a few:
coop, player housing. We would also like to add much more content to
the game, enemies, bosses, more tilesets, sound, music, items, theme
sets.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Developing Everworld Island costs alot
of money and will be spent on sound, music, programming, graphics and
we appreciate every support that we can get.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you have any
suggestions,feedback,ideas on how to improve Everworld Island, please
head over to our official forums, since you guys will be shaping the
game alongside us.</p>
<p>The multiplayer part is integrated though the cooperative features like the switch systems which can be only activated together are missing completely!</p>

<p><b>Items and Coins:</b></p>
<p>The player starts with no coins or
items. These must be collected in levels to buy new objects for his
home or for new level objects for the level editor. After the
creation of levels the player can share them with other people
online. These can be played by other players again, so they can get
new items and coins.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Global Map &amp; Levels:</b></p>
<p>The game is splitted into two parts.
The first one is the global map which is static. On the global map
the players can also find the shop. The second part are the
user-created levels which is the dynamic part of the game. In these
levels the players can find and collect different items and coins
which they can trade for new objects in the shop on the global map.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Housing:</b></p>
<p>After buying a piece of ground which
the players can buy at the shop, they're able to use a portal to get
to this plot of land. On this plot they can build their own house
using the collected or bought blocks and items. At the house the
players can plant seeds to grow different plants and flowers. These
plants can be used to brew different potions in a bowl  like a heal
potion. The players are also able to place furnitures and other
inside the house.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Multiplayer:</b></p>
<p>The focus of Everworld Island is the
cooperative multiplayer mode.  This means that the player must use a
water pump while another player must lead the water jet against a
target for example. Likewise there are tons of possibillities to
create different switch - riddles which can only be solved by more
than one player.</p>
<p>The different classes which can be
choosen inside the level at different spots are important to finish a
level. This means that one player must choose the diver as a class to
dive into a lake to activate a switch, another one must choose the
mechanic to repair an elevator for example.</p>
<p>By these dynamic levels created by
players there will be endless possibillites how to solve a level.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Leveleditor:</b></p>
<p>Everworld Island includes a very easy
to use leveleditor where everyone can create their own levels. If you
have a good concept for a story then create a campaign which means
that you can string more than one level together. The campgain or
also a single level can be shared with friends and other people. Of
course you can also play them with your friends! New objects like
plants, elevators, new enemies, etc. can be bought at the Shop with
coins.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Day/Night Cycle:</b></p>
<p>The game also contains a day and night
cycle. The levels adapt to the current cycle and behave differently.
This means that there are ghosts which spook while it's night or
secret ""ghost ways"" which only appear at night and lead to
special places for example. While daytime there are special enemies
which would sleep at night or npcs which only appear while it's
daytime.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Pets:</b></p>
<p>If you have collected enough coins and
finished enough levels then you're able to buy a pet which can follow
you through the levels and even help you! E.g. a dog can sniff
treasures under the earth and even dig them out. Other pets like the Fairy will function like a light source at night, but they're also able to fight against ghosts. Pets must be
fed daily or they get moody and won't follow you inside a level.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<br/><p><b>The Magician:</b> The Magician can use different Spells to defeat his foes, and in some cases magic is the only way to destroy enemies.</p>

Multiplayer game, that can be played both, Online or over LAN with up
to 4 Players. The most unique features in this game are the Campaign
and Level editor,which allows you to create, share and play levels,
campaigns or stories with your friends or with people from all over
the world without any programming knowledge. There will also be a
variety of classes, like the Mage,Knight,Mechanic,Diver. Each Class
has their own abilities, the Diver for example, will be able to swim,
and dive for treasures or hidden secrets.


There will also be a wide range of
items that can be found and collected in the levels, like Potions,
Treasure Maps, rare items that can be placed in your home for others
to see.


The Day/Night cycle within the game
will allow more variety in your levels. For example some encounters
are only triggered during a specific daytime, like ghosts, and some
secrets rooms are only active at night, while plant like enemies are
only active during the day.


Why do we need the money?
There are quite a few features already
in the game, but some are missing completely, just to name a few:
coop, player housing. We would also like to add much more content to
the game, enemies, bosses, more tilesets, sound, music, items, theme
sets.


Developing Everworld Island costs alot
of money and will be spent on sound, music, programming, graphics and
we appreciate every support that we can get.




If you have any
suggestions,feedback,ideas on how to improve Everworld Island, please
head over to our official forums, since you guys will be shaping the
game alongside us.
The multiplayer part is integrated though the cooperative features like the switch systems which can be only activated together are missing completely!

Player Housing







From the collected money we have to pay
19% betterment tax. 7% goes out for the Sound and Music. The remain
goes out for the rent and other costs.



Items and Coins:
The player starts with no coins or
items. These must be collected in levels to buy new objects for his
home or for new level objects for the level editor. After the
creation of levels the player can share them with other people
online. These can be played by other players again, so they can get
new items and coins.


Global Map & Levels:
The game is splitted into two parts.
The first one is the global map which is static. On the global map
the players can also find the shop. The second part are the
user-created levels which is the dynamic part of the game. In these
levels the players can find and collect different items and coins
which they can trade for new objects in the shop on the global map.




Housing:
After buying a piece of ground which
the players can buy at the shop, they're able to use a portal to get
to this plot of land. On this plot they can build their own house
using the collected or bought blocks and items. At the house the
players can plant seeds to grow different plants and flowers. These
plants can be used to brew different potions in a bowl  like a heal
potion. The players are also able to place furnitures and other
inside the house.


Multiplayer:
The focus of Everworld Island is the
cooperative multiplayer mode.  This means that the player must use a
water pump while another player must lead the water jet against a
target for example. Likewise there are tons of possibillities to
create different switch - riddles which can only be solved by more
than one player.
The different classes which can be
choosen inside the level at different spots are important to finish a
level. This means that one player must choose the diver as a class to
dive into a lake to activate a switch, another one must choose the
mechanic to repair an elevator for example.
By these dynamic levels created by
players there will be endless possibillites how to solve a level.


Leveleditor:
Everworld Island includes a very easy
to use leveleditor where everyone can create their own levels. If you
have a good concept for a story then create a campaign which means
that you can string more than one level together. The campgain or
also a single level can be shared with friends and other people. Of
course you can also play them with your friends! New objects like
plants, elevators, new enemies, etc. can be bought at the Shop with
coins.


Day/Night Cycle:
The game also contains a day and night
cycle. The levels adapt to the current cycle and behave differently.
This means that there are ghosts which spook while it's night or
secret ""ghost ways"" which only appear at night and lead to
special places for example. While daytime there are special enemies
which would sleep at night or npcs which only appear while it's
daytime.


Pets:
If you have collected enough coins and
finished enough levels then you're able to buy a pet which can follow
you through the levels and even help you! E.g. a dog can sniff
treasures under the earth and even dig them out. Other pets like the Fairy will function like a light source at night, but they're also able to fight against ghosts. Pets must be
fed daily or they get moody and won't follow you inside a level.


The Magician: The Magician can use different Spells to defeat his foes, and in some cases magic is the only way to destroy enemies.
The Diver: The Diver is a true treasure hunter, with his swimming and diving abilities he is able to find sunken treasures or hidden secrets underwater.
The Mechanic: Something is broken? He can fix it. The Mechanic is capable of repairing elevators  or every other kind of complex mechanisms.
The Knight: This guy belongs to the front of your Party, with his Swords and Hammers he can destroy armored enemies or break blocks that are meant to be broken.

Mantenerlas bajo control y denegarles la más pequeña victoria en terreno enano es vital para la supervivencia del nuevo reino.The game includes:- Box- Board game- A puzzle of cardboard pieces with the built up city- Rulebook in English and Spanish- 90 Dwarven and Monster tokens (upgradeable to plastic figures in the Stretch goals)- 80 Wooden Resource cubes- 4 Role tokens- 5 Score counters- 2 Large Mine cardboard pieces- 100 Small Mine cardboard pieces- 50 CardsEl juego incluye:- Caja- Tablero- Un puzzle de cartón con la ciudad construida- Manual en inglés y español- 90 fichas de enanos y monstruos (sustituidas por miniaturas de plástico si alcanzamos el objetivo de financiación indicado abajo)- 80 cubos de recursos de madera- 4 marcadores de puesto- 5 contadores de puntuación- 2 piezas grandes de Minas en cartón- 100 piezas pequeñas de Minas en cartón- 50 CartasWe've been working on Rocky Crown for close to a year and we believe it has reached maturity. There are some art assets still uncompleted and the game is still undergoing local playtesting to ensure an entertaining and balanced experience for players, but aside from that the game is now done. We believe it is a good, fun, original game and it deserves to see the light of day, but we need your help to see it done. We could release it on our own but we consider that crowdfunding has many advantages.It gives us global visibility, which ensures we're not going to end up sitting on a lot of boxes. It allows us to include more things in the box knowing that there are lower risks involved. And, there is a special reason for this project, highlighted below down in the stretch goal list.Rocky Crown is a game about dwarves and monsters, so it could benefit inmensely from adding miniatures to it. While we could face the risks involved in taking the game to press ourselves, there is a minimum run required for manufacturers to be interested in adding miniatures. That amount is not realistical for a project like ours, as we lack proper channels for selling such large amounts.So... what is my money for?The money from the pledges will be used to pay for the manufacturing cost, to pay for the high costs of shipping, and to pay the artist for his time and tears. Aside from that, some money will go to Indiegogo.com and Paypal, part of it to pay VAT, taxes and other costs and should any money remain, it'd be used to advance further in the stretch goal ladder. Profit comes from selling the remaining boxes.Hemos estado trabajando en Rocky Crown cerca de un año y consideramos que ha alcanzado la madurez. Todavía hay algunas ilustraciones por completar y el juego aún está en su fase final de testeo para asegurar una experiencia entretenida y equilibrada para los jugadores, pero por lo demás el juego está completo.Creemos que es un buen juego, entretenido y original y que merece ver la luz del día, pero necesitamos tu ayuda para poder hacerlo. Podríamos llegar a publicarlo por nuestra cuenta pero consideramos que el crowdfunding tiene muchas ventajas. Nos da una mayor visibilidad global, que garantiza que no terminaremos sentados encima de un montón de cajas sin vender. Nos permite incluir más elementos en la caja, sabiendo que el proyecto entraña un menor peligro. Y hay un motivo especial para este proyecto, indicado en las profundidades de la lista de objetivos desbloqueables.Rocky Crown es un juego que trata sobre enanos y monstruos, así que se beneficiaría inmensamente de añadirle miniaturas. Aunque podríamos asumir el riesgo derivado de enviar el juego a fabrica, existe una producción mínima requerida por los fabricantes para añadir miniaturas. Esa cantidad no es realista para un proyecto como el nuestro, ya que no disponemos de los canales adecuados para vender una cantidad tan grande. Así que... para que necesitáis mi dinero?El dinero de los colaboradores ira destinado a pagar el coste de manufacturación, a pagar los altísimos costes de envío, y a pagarle al ilustrador su tiempo y lágrimas. Aparte de ello, parte del dinero irá a Indiegogo.com y a Paypal, parte de él a pagar IVA, impuestos y otros costes y, caso de que sobrara dinero, lo emplearíamos en avanzar en la escala de recompensas. El beneficio para el autor proviene de la venta del resto de cajas al público.The game will be manufactured with Panda Game Manufacturing, in China. They have an excellent track record and more than a hundred published games. We've already contacted them and budgets and timetables have already been put at our disposal.The game files will be sent to factory in early Feb. 2014 and games should arrive around July 2014. We cannot make asurances on slight delays but it'll definitely arrive on the Summer.Reaching the plastic miniatures goal on our stretch goal chart may be an additional source of delay but with the current timetables it should not represent a problem, as we're already set some time between the end of the crowdfunding and the manufacturing.El juego será manufacturado con Panda Game Manufacturing, en China. Tienen un excelente historial y más de cien juegos publicados. Ya hemos contactado con ellos y nos han enviado presupuestos y estimaciones de calendario.Los archivos del juego serán enviados a principios de Febrero de 2014 y los juegos deberían llegar en torno a Julio de 2014. No podemos hacer promesas respecto a posibles pequeños retrasos pero sin duda llegará en verano.Si alcanzáramos el objetivo mínimo para poder producir miniaturas de plástico, podría ocurrir un pequeño retraso adicional pero con las estimaciones actuales no debería suponer un problema, ya que ya hemos dejado algo de tiempo entre el final de la microfinanciación y la manufacturación.If you are a retailer or distributor and are interested in Rocky Crown please send an e-mail to javiergsebastian@gmail.com.Si eres un distribuidor y estás interesado en Rocky Crown por favor envía un correo a javiergsebastian@gmail.com",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Project Goals<br/>
</h3>At VolksPC (<a href=""http://www.volkspc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.volkspc.org</a>) we want to build a low cost low power Linux PC. 
<p>Linux
 desktops have been shipping for a while but we still cannot buy a low 
cost Linux PC that comes with software pre-installed. Our initial plan 
was to use an ARM CPU and run a Debian desktop such as LXDE/XFCE. We 
soon realized that Debian ARM does not support YouTube playback and 
because of a lack of drivers, HD video playback was just not possible. 
Android, on the other hand, does this very well and also has many 
applications not available on Debian, So we went back to the drawing 
board and came up with a solution that allows both Android and Debian  
applications to run simultaneously at native speeds. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>VolksPC Hardware</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The VolksPC hardware has the following specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dual core Rockchip RK3066 Cortex-A9 CPU running at 1.4Ghz.</li>
<li>1 GB DDR3</li>
<li>8 GB NAND Flash (Android)</li>
<li>Optional 8 GB Class 10 MicroSD (Debian Wheezy)</li>

<p></p>
<p>Our unified software is  stable and runs well 
on a RK3066 based set-top box provided by a large Shenzhen manufacturer.

<h3>Review of Unified Distribution<br/>
</h3>
<p>We only have a few boxes of our final hardware so we don't have 
enough units to give for testing. We have also ported and tested our 
software on MK808 mini-PC. Mr Jean-Luc Aufranc from cnx-software was 
kind enough to review the MK808 running our unified Android and Debian 
distribution.</p>
<p>Here is a video clip of his review.</p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F1COXpQ_J2gY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1COXpQ_J2gY&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F1COXpQ_J2gY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p>Some of the things that he liked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance is good- fast booting, fast switching and fast loading of LibreOffice and Chromium.</li>
<li>He tested several Android apps such ES File Explorer, Google Play, YouTube and they all worked well.</li>
<li>Antutu 4.x benchmark gave a score of 10521 points. This confirmed that Debian did not in any way slow down Android.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some software issues that he found:</p>
<ul>
<li>He could not login to SAMBA share with ES File Explorer. This will be fixed.</li>
<li>Some Debian directories and files are not visible from Android. This will be fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some stability issues that seems particular to MK808 hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>Random WIfi disconnects. This is particular to MK808 as can be seen if you Google ""MK808 WIfI problems"".</li>
<li>Random disconnect of USB keybord. We could not duplicate this on our hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>The MK808 is a low cost mini-PC with limited ports requiring 
users to connect to an external hub to provide additional ports. Also 
the power supply provided with MK808 is not designed to source current 
required for the additional USB devices causing some instability.</p>
<p>Our
 final hardware has comprehensive set of ports, Wifi antennae and much 
better heat dissipation. We have not seen any stability issues in our 
testing.</p>

<h3>MicroXwin Technology<br/>
</h3>
<p>At VolksPC LLC we created the fastest X-Windows implementation called MicroXwin. Here is a clip (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zttcdPtJN8A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zttcdPtJN8A</a>) of MicroXwin running on a Raspberry Pi and on a Cubieboard2 (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T18FhSTQ08k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T18FhSTQ08k</a>). <br/></p>
<p>Linux desktop distributions 
don't have any interest in providing Android compatibility. There are 
community projects such as Linux on Android which allow Linux desktop 
graphics to be displayed on Android through VNC viewer. The problem with
 this approach is that Linux graphics applications must run through 
several software layers making it very slow.</p>
<p>With MicroXwin graphics technology we can run  both Android and Debian applications at native speeds.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Technical FAQ</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of integrating Android with Debian ?</strong></p>
<p>Users can install a lot of applications both  from Android market place and from Debian repositories.</p>
<p><strong>What Debian applications are pre-installed on VolksPC ?</strong></p>
<p>We have a base set off applications such as Chrome Browser, 
LibreOffice suite, Evince PDF viewer, Mplayer Video Playback, 
Transmission  bit-torrent client and Pidgin chat client.</p>
<p><strong>Why doesn’t Debian run KDE or Gnome desktop ?</strong></p>
<p>Both KDE and Gnome are big desktops in terms of memory usage. Our  latest <a href=""http://www.volkspc.org/unified-distribution/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">unified distribution</a>  is based on XFCE desktop environment.</p>
<p><strong> Is this technology same as Linux On Android ?</strong></p>
<p>Linux on Android uses VNC viewer Android application  to display 
Linux desktop graphics. In our implementation Linux desktop graphics is 
handled by  <a href=""http://www.volkspc.org/MicroXwin/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MicroXwin</a> which make our solution very fast.</p>
<p><strong>Who  is the default user on Debian ?</strong></p>
<p>Our distribution is set up to auto login into user  called desktop. There is no password prompt.</p>
<p><strong>How is time zone and locale configured for Debian ?</strong></p>
<p>When Debian starts up it reads this configuration form Android 
settings. So if user changes Android settings it will take effect on the
 next boot.</p>
<p><strong>Is GPU supported on the unified distribution ?</strong></p>
<p>Android supports GPU and OpenGL ES applications. Debian on the other 
hand  doesn’t have support for GPU  at this time. We will add GPU 
support for Debian when there are  more OpenGL ES games available.</p>
<p><strong>Wouldn’t Debian applications run slower without GPU support ?</strong></p>
<p>GPU accelerates 3D rendering but for most 2D rendering CPU works 
better than GPU as there is significant overhead in setting up the GPU 
hardware. Also MicroXwin is much  faster than standard X. GPU can 
accelerate Linux Games but there are not many OpenGL ES games available 
on Debian.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>
</h1>
<h3>Why support this project<br/>
</h3>

Linux desktop distributions such as Debian have had limited market success because there are not many commercial applications written for it. Also  x86 computers  with Debain/Ubuntu pre-installed are more expensive than a Windows PC.<br/><br/>With VolksPC we can create a Linux PC that is low cost and has access to a  large base of both commercial and open source applications. We think that this VolksPC
 unit is perfect for students of science and technology who can learn 
programming with the tools available on Debian and also have access to 
games on the Android market place. <br/><br/><p>With our expertise in Linux graphics (MicroXwin ) we are uniquely qualified to create such a device.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>What will the money be used for<br/>
</h3>
<p>Our manufacturer needs a minimum order quantity of 1000 units to ship
 boxes with our software installed on the internal Flash memory. With 
your pledges we will be able to do so.</p>
<p>If we surpass our goals, we will invest the funds for even better integration between Android and Linux.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Project Timeline</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This is our rough estimates on the various milestones for this project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>August 1- </b><b>Indiegogo Campaign  Begins.  </b>We already have few samples from our manufacturer.  We are finalizing software and continuing with more  testing.</li>
<li>
<b>September 1-</b><b> Close of Campaign.</b> At this point we should 
have final software release ready for manufacturing. Our manufacturing 
partner will be informed about the expected volume and required deposit 
will be sent. Manufacturer needs 30 days to get box ready.</li>
<li>
<b>October 1- November 15 Pledge Fulfillment.</b> We will receive VolksPC from our Shenzhen manufacturer and will start shipping to our backers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>We are primarily a software company and our software has been 
extensively tested on the several RK3066 based set-top boxes. If there 
are software issues after deployment users can upgrade both Android and 
XFCE distribution.</p>
<p>Manufacturing is always a risk and challenge. To mitigate this risk 
we have based our design on a mature Rockchip  RK3066 SOC and a set-top 
box that is already being manufactured and shipped in high volumes. We 
are not making any changes to their hardware. The  only change we are 
making is to replace their Android distribution with ours.</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Shipping<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>US shipping is included in the perk. Add an additional $30 for world wide shipping.<br/></p>
<p>Customs Fees &amp; Duties:  You will most likely have to pay duties 
upon delivery of your perk outside the USA.  These vary by country and 
we cannot quote them ahead of time.  In the EU expect to pay the VAT and
 any national sales tax.  In Canada GST will likely be charged.  Please 
check your local laws.  .</p>
<h3>About VolksPC LLC</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are a software company with developers based in Silicon Valley and
 Bangalore. We created a high performance X-WIndows software called 
MicroXwin that is 2X faster than standard X.</p>
<p>With VolksPC  we want to combine our software expertise with 
commodity Android hardware to create a unique system that is 
user-friendly, hackable, fast and can run both Android and Debian 
applications simultaneously.</p>

Random WIfi disconnects. This is particular to MK808 as can be seen if you Google ""MK808 WIfI problems"".
Random disconnect of USB keybord. We could not duplicate this on our hardware.

The MK808 is a low cost mini-PC with limited ports requiring 
users to connect to an external hub to provide additional ports. Also 
the power supply provided with MK808 is not designed to source current 
required for the additional USB devices causing some instability.
Our
 final hardware has comprehensive set of ports, Wifi antennae and much 
better heat dissipation. We have not seen any stability issues in our 
testing.
  


MicroXwin Technology

At VolksPC LLC we created the fastest X-Windows implementation called MicroXwin. Here is a clip (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zttcdPtJN8A) of MicroXwin running on a Raspberry Pi and on a Cubieboard2 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T18FhSTQ08k). 
Linux desktop distributions 
don't have any interest in providing Android compatibility. There are 
community projects such as Linux on Android which allow Linux desktop 
graphics to be displayed on Android through VNC viewer. The problem with
 this approach is that Linux graphics applications must run through 
several software layers making it very slow.
With MicroXwin graphics technology we can run  both Android and Debian applications at native speeds.

Technical FAQ

What are the benefits of integrating Android with Debian ?
Users can install a lot of applications both  from Android market place and from Debian repositories.
What Debian applications are pre-installed on VolksPC ?
We have a base set off applications such as Chrome Browser, 
LibreOffice suite, Evince PDF viewer, Mplayer Video Playback, 
Transmission  bit-torrent client and Pidgin chat client.
Why doesn’t Debian run KDE or Gnome desktop ?
Both KDE and Gnome are big desktops in terms of memory usage. Our  latest unified distribution  is based on XFCE desktop environment.
 Is this technology same as Linux On Android ?
Linux on Android uses VNC viewer Android application  to display 
Linux desktop graphics. In our implementation Linux desktop graphics is 
handled by  MicroXwin which make our solution very fast.
Who  is the default user on Debian ?
Our distribution is set up to auto login into user  called desktop. There is no password prompt.
How is time zone and locale configured for Debian ?
When Debian starts up it reads this configuration form Android 
settings. So if user changes Android settings it will take effect on the
 next boot.
Is GPU supported on the unified distribution ?
Android supports GPU and OpenGL ES applications. Debian on the other 
hand  doesn’t have support for GPU  at this time. We will add GPU 
support for Debian when there are  more OpenGL ES games available.
Wouldn’t Debian applications run slower without GPU support ?
GPU accelerates 3D rendering but for most 2D rendering CPU works 
better than GPU as there is significant overhead in setting up the GPU 
hardware. Also MicroXwin is much  faster than standard X. GPU can 
accelerate Linux Games but there are not many OpenGL ES games available 
on Debian.



Why support this project


Linux desktop distributions such as Debian have had limited market success because there are not many commercial applications written for it. Also  x86 computers  with Debain/Ubuntu pre-installed are more expensive than a Windows PC.With VolksPC we can create a Linux PC that is low cost and has access to a  large base of both commercial and open source applications. We think that this VolksPC
 unit is perfect for students of science and technology who can learn 
programming with the tools available on Debian and also have access to 
games on the Android market place. With our expertise in Linux graphics (MicroXwin ) we are uniquely qualified to create such a device.
  
What will the money be used for

Our manufacturer needs a minimum order quantity of 1000 units to ship
 boxes with our software installed on the internal Flash memory. With 
your pledges we will be able to do so.
If we surpass our goals, we will invest the funds for even better integration between Android and Linux.

Project Timeline

This is our rough estimates on the various milestones for this project.


August 1- Indiegogo Campaign  Begins.  We already have few samples from our manufacturer.  We are finalizing software and continuing with more  testing.

September 1- Close of Campaign. At this point we should 
have final software release ready for manufacturing. Our manufacturing 
partner will be informed about the expected volume and required deposit 
will be sent. Manufacturer needs 30 days to get box ready.

October 1- November 15 Pledge Fulfillment. We will receive VolksPC from our Shenzhen manufacturer and will start shipping to our backers.

Risks & Challenges  
We are primarily a software company and our software has been 
extensively tested on the several RK3066 based set-top boxes. If there 
are software issues after deployment users can upgrade both Android and 
XFCE distribution.
Manufacturing is always a risk and challenge. To mitigate this risk 
we have based our design on a mature Rockchip  RK3066 SOC and a set-top 
box that is already being manufactured and shipped in high volumes. We 
are not making any changes to their hardware. The  only change we are 
making is to replace their Android distribution with ours.


Shipping


US shipping is included in the perk. Add an additional $30 for world wide shipping.
Customs Fees & Duties:  You will most likely have to pay duties 
upon delivery of your perk outside the USA.  These vary by country and 
we cannot quote them ahead of time.  In the EU expect to pay the VAT and
 any national sales tax.  In Canada GST will likely be charged.  Please 
check your local laws.  .
About VolksPC LLC

We are a software company with developers based in Silicon Valley and
 Bangalore. We created a high performance X-WIndows software called 
MicroXwin that is 2X faster than standard X.
With VolksPC  we want to combine our software expertise with 
commodity Android hardware to create a unique system that is 
user-friendly, hackable, fast and can run both Android and Debian 
applications simultaneously.",1.0,3,"2 Campaigns

Hello, My name is Jan Groenhoej. 
The Ecliptic Game is an ambitious project presenting a new educational and competitive gaming platform for Gamers in general, friends and families and people with interest in personal development and astrology. For Astrologers the Board will even be useful for Students and Client sessions.Astrology is a very useful tool for understanding our individual personalities and conditions of life as well as people around us. 
Through my studies of psychotherapy and
corporate psychology I recognize how people fit into their Astrological
archetypes. 
To present these facts in a new and interesting way I have developed the Astrological Board
Game – named Ecliptic.
The idea of presenting Astrology as a Board
Game is a wish to share Astrology in a different way as a game
full of action and fun with friends and families. My hope is that it will raise the incitement to discus personal subjects like feelings, passions, motivations, desires,
ambitions and values. 
From the excitement expressed by playing
with friends and family – and some Astrologers, when playing my game, the idea of making the
Ecliptic game available to the public came to life. 
My challenge has been making the game plan accessible for everyone requiring no astrological
knowledge and yet still to be true to the Astrological literature.
The
Ecliptic design and game plan is now ready for production in English, German
and Danish.  To make The
Ecliptic Game a reality I’m looking for your support through this crowdfunding
platform to start a production and in return I wish to support you with great and useful perks.Goals and Incentives:
The goal
is to achieve a funding of € 40.000, - to start a production to meet our Backers perks and setting up a smart Web-store making Ecliptic game available for future sale through your unique personal links, rewarding your support and interest financially.Support of € 20 or € 40 triggers a voucher and a unique personal links to our backers, with rewards of respectively 5 or 10 % commission each month of every sale directed from your personal link activated from your Facebook, Webpage, Web shop etc. Redeeming your voucher by paying the difference to receive the Ecliptic Game will adjust your commission link rate accordingly.Support with € 80 will give you the Ecliptic Game (choose language) incl.

And also have previous experiences in developing small games for a range of platforms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe that in order to achieve our goal of developing AAA titles for our fans to enjoy, we first need to start small, and mobile games will be our ticket to success.<br/><br/>We need your help to turn our concepts into reality, and to further expand Random Studios in order to take on bigger challenges which will not only benefit us, but our fans as well, in the form of new and exciting games.</p>
<p>Your contributions will allow us to purchase testing devices to further improve our first project, Randy (see below) by optimizing its performance across all devices we are targeting, so all players can experience Randy.<br/>The money will also allow us to hire artists to create amazing music tracks and sound effects, purchase additional software, and many other development costs which will allow us to implement so much more into the game.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Randy will be Random Studios first title and will hit the Apple App Store later this year!<br/>Randy is a platform puzzler in which players will guide the main character (Randy) through a series of puzzles designed to make you think on the spot by reacting to obstacles set out to capture you for scrap metal.<img alt=""Randy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38359024/indiegogo%20images/randy.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>The game will revolve around Randy losing his navigation unit which will allow him to only move forward, and it is up to you, the player, to guide Randy through the levels with our simple gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>The core mechanic of the game is the tiles which you roll over. When you touch the screen, the tile you are currently on will rotate Randy left, so to avoid robots or obstacles ahead. The main goal of every level is to get Randy to the end of the map without coming into contact with other robots and obstacles.</p>
<p>Not only will the gameplay be fun and addictive, players will be able to continue to play levels over again to collect items which can be used to purchase customisations and other fun stuff from the in game store to modify Randy and enable additional features as well!</p>
<p><img alt=""customise"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/38359024/indiegogo%20images/Customisations.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;""/></p>
<p>We are also looking into ways in which we can connect our players to their social networks if they choose to do so. This will enable them to easily communicate their achievements and scores with their friends!</p>
<p>Testing is a huge part of our development process to make sure that our ideas and mechanics are enjoyable. The core mechanics and features have been tested by taking a prototype build of the game to Exhibitions to gather vital feedback so we could alter features in the game in accordance with the input we received. We believe that testing our game and reworking ideas with our audience will allow us to produce a product which will appeal to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Your contributions will enable us to make Randy the best it can possibly be, and to help us support the game well after its release date through updates, as well as bringing it to other platforms such as PC and Mac.</p>

<p>As explained above, most of our funding will be going into development costs for Randy, while the rest will be going straight back to our backers in the form of awesome rewards!</p>
<p>Before getting to the rewards, we want to share with you how your contributions will be spent on developing Randy.<br/>You might be asking yourself, “Why do other game developers request so much more and you guys are only asking for $12k?.”<br/>Well, since we are a small Indie team, our overheads are miniscule compared to companies who have had years to increase their team sizes into the hundreds. We are working hard to deliver an amazing game which will look and play as a high quality game created by those developers, and are putting all funds received into the game to make that happen. Due to the small nature of the team, some costs are already accounted for, but we still require a bit more to help us achieve our goals.</p>
<p>The breakdown of our development costs are:<br/><em>Devices for testing</em> - $3,000<br/><em>Business Expenses</em> - $2,000<br/><em>Additional Hardware </em>- $2,000<br/><em>Rewards for you! </em>- $5,000+</p>
<p>If we reach our goal, we will be able to implement many more features which we will not be able to otherwise; these features will allow us to create a game for the Apple App Store which will seriously compete with other top selling games. If we go beyond our goal, we will continue to improve and bring new features to Randy through updates, as well as be able to work on new IP’s straight after the games release!</p>

<p>When developing games there are always risks of things going wrong, and our number one risk would be if we had to push back the release date.<br/>We have many safety nets in place to prevent problems during our development, but as we are a small Indie Team attempting to create a game with so many features there is a chance of delay. But rest assured we are all working very hard to have the game ready for release on the Apple App Store by the end of this year.<br/>If some lower priority features do not make the initial release, we will definitely include it as an update later in the Apps lifetime.<br/>If however we require an extra month to finalise the game, we would be very appreciative for your patience while we work hard to get our game to you to play.</p>

When developing games there are always risks of things going wrong, and our number one risk would be if we had to push back the release date.We have many safety nets in place to prevent problems during our development, but as we are a small Indie Team attempting to create a game with so many features there is a chance of delay. But rest assured we are all working very hard to have the game ready for release on the Apple App Store by the end of this year.If some lower priority features do not make the initial release, we will definitely include it as an update later in the Apps lifetime.If however we require an extra month to finalise the game, we would be very appreciative for your patience while we work hard to get our game to you to play.
 

Once we release Randy for the Apple App Store, we will begin optimising the game to be played on PC and Mac so we can reach even more people!We will also be working hard on updates to bring to our players so there will always be fresh content for you to enjoy.
If Randy enables us to continue on a new project you can be sure to see more games from us in the near future!
 

There are plenty of ways you can help us out! The best and easiest way is to head over to our Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and YouTube pages and hit those Likes/Follow/Subscribe buttons to keep up to date with all the latest news. Also get your friends to join in; we want everyone to enjoy our games!
Finally, everyone at Random Studios would like to thank you for taking the time to look at our Indiegogo campaign and all of your support so far!",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Just as we were getting to know the 8x8km island map of Erangel and its desert-themed counterpart Miramar, we now have even more new PUBG maps to get excited about.</p>
<p>From the recently released jungle map of Sanhok, a 4x4km jungle map designed for constant fighting, to a new snow PUBG map called Vikendi, there’s always at least one more killing field in which to get your next chicken dinner. To help keep you updated on all of the PUBG new maps, we have assembled this roundup of everything we know about all the upcoming battlegrounds.</p>
<p>One of PUBG’s best features is its range of colossal maps – they are big enough to cater to different playstyles and feature an unmatched variety of combat scenarios for would-be military tacticians to overcome. However, the newest PUBG new map is very different. This ice cold 6x6km map tracks footsteps and vehicle tracks as you battle it out in the shadow of a huge mountain. But, what’s next? Here’s everything we know about all the new PUBG maps.</p>
<p>PUBG SNOW MAP RELEASE DATE</p>

<h2>Where are we now?</h2>
<p>GAME.minder currently has more than <strong>28,000</strong> registered gamers using more than <strong>430,000</strong> RE.minders to track more than <strong>1700</strong> different games (wowzers).

<li>Showing ads</li>
<li>Selling games via Amazon.com and the AppStore for an afilliate cut</li>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>What do we need from you?</h2>

After this transition, <strong>it is our goal to have GAME.minder remain free, for your first 5 RE.minders</strong>. If you are never planning to track more than 5 games, GAME.minder will remain free.</p>
<p>However, if you want to track more than 5 upcoming games, you will need to pay for a yearly subscription. We're currently thinking somewhere in the $10-15 range for one year. With this paid subscription, you will be able to set an unlimited number of RE.minders.</p>
<h2>Why do you need so much money?</h2>
<p>It's important to know what you're paying for. GAME.minder is a large system, with a lot of moving parts. In order to build out this subscription system, we need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build support for the concept of subscriptions into the backend system</li>
<li>Build support for subscription payments into GAMEminder.com</li>
<li>Build support for subscriptions into the iOS app</li>
<li>Build support for subscriptions into the Android app</li>

<p>""You are asking us to give you money, so you can build a way to take people's money?""</p>

Unarmed, you can only overcome the obstacles learning the secrets of the arcane arts through ancient texts you discover along the path. These writings teach magic formulas which, if pronounced correctly, enable you to perform several spells. Using these powers in a creative way you can <b>solve puzzles</b>, <b>overcome traps</b> and <b>kill the enemies</b> which try to hinder you.

<p>Our team is called Indomitus Games. We are a group of young Italian artists and programmers who have joined forces to develop an innovative gaming product: In Verbis Virtus.</p>
<p>It all began from a <b>university project</b> at the Politecnico di Milano. At the beginning, our group was composed just by <b>few programmers</b>. However, the concept of In Verbis Virtus immediately attracted a lot of interest, so the team quickly grew with graphics and audio specialists that could take care of the <b>artistic aspects</b> of the game. The team now includes:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/110131/files/20131003013324-Indomitus_Games__Tipacci.jpg?1380789204"" src="""" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""/></p>

<p>Here at Indomitus Games <strong>we love making games</strong>, but creating something like In Verbis Virtus <strong>is not that simple</strong>. Until today we have put a lot of time and energy and money into this project and we are very proud of what we have achieved so far. We have already published a very early alpha stage playable demo. Since then, we have created much more content of which we showed only a tiny part, and we gathered a quite large community. Yes, we are talking about <strong>you</strong>, our fans. You are our most valuable asset and now we need your help to complete this ambitious project and bring the world of In Verbis Virtus on your computers.<br/></p>
<h2>What is the money for?</h2>
<p><span>Fair question. Basically we need the money for the same things as any other company does: rent, bills, software licenses, personnel, etc... You’re probably wondering whether we need all these money to finish In Verbis Virtus. Believe it or not, it’s not a large sum at all for a video game, and the only reason it’s even cheap is because our staff have voluntereed in the past two years and are willing to work for the bare minimum to try and increase the odds of meeting our goal. </span></p><p>Here is a cost breakdown:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/90561/files/20130923073135-Cosa_servono_i_soldi_def.jpg?1379946695"" src="""" style=""""/></p><ul>

<li><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$16,000: Manufacturing and shipping physical rewards</span></li>
</ul><br/><h2>Are you asking to cover all the expenses?</h2>
<p><span>No, not at all. The goal amount we are asking for is about 50% of what the production of In Verbis Virtus actually costs. Until now everyone at Indomitus Games worked for the glory but we can't continue without your support. To complete In Verbis Virtus we need to be able to concentrate only on this project for some months. We will also need to hire qualified professionals to do the work that no one in the team can do (translations, dubbing, etc...). Furthermore commercial licenses of some software are very expensive.</span></p>
<p>Through crowdfunding you will be able to help us dealing with the difficulties of indie game development. Anyway, you won't do this for nothing in return: we prepared tons of really nice rewards for you!</p><p>Moreover, as we approach our goal, we can dedicate our time to In Verbis Virtus with more confidence. This means that the sooner we receive your help, the sooner we can deliver the <b>new demo</b> and work toward the final version. So if you intend to contribute, please do so at your earliest possible convenience!</p><br/><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indomitusgames.com/indiegogo/Header%20Capitoli_stretch%20goals.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Our main goal is to make In Verbis Virtus a great game but why not making it even greater? And what could make a game better than creating it as the players would like it to be?<br/></p><p>We listened to the requests of our fans for additional features and we chose stretch goals accordingly. Every dollar we gather with this campaign will be used to enhance In Verbis Virtus, but some features will be added after the game release to avoid delaying it. We know you can't wait playing In Verbis Virtus!</p><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.indomitusgames.com/indiegogo/Cornice%20Obbiettivi_02.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Oculus Rift</strong> is a virtual reality headset designed to make 3D gaming even more immersive. Since it was first announced our fans asked us to support this amazing technology and we would really like to do so! In Verbis Virtus would become a very innovative experience with Oculus Rift.</p>
<p>Today <strong>smartphones and tablets</strong> are widespread, especially among tech enthusiasts such as our supporters, so we decided to use them to enhance the gaming experience. We would like to develop an app that lets you use mobile devices as your spellbook and journal. Further features will be discussed later.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Leap Motion</strong> is an innovative device that enables you to control your computer moving your hands and fingers. Wouldn't it be awesome to cast spells with magic gestures in addition (or alternatively) to magic words?</p>
<p>And then there is something that really a lot of people asked: <strong>multiplayer</strong>. Nowadays a large number of games allow to play over LAN or on the Internet to take fun to another level. We hope that In Verbis Virtus will be no less than these games, but a multiplayer mode needs infrastructures, additional maps and more. That's why we need further help to reach this objective.</p>

In Verbis Virtus is a first person video game that mixes action and puzzle elements in a fantasy setting.
You play as a wizard who can cast spells pronouncing magic formulas. The innovation of this game resides in the control system: the player must use a microphone to perform spells by actually saying the magic words. In fact the title could be translated from Latin as ""Power is in Words"".
In Verbis Virtus begins with you entering a dark dungeon that hides many dangers. Unarmed, you can only overcome the obstacles learning the secrets of the arcane arts through ancient texts you discover along the path. These writings teach magic formulas which, if pronounced correctly, enable you to perform several spells. Using these powers in a creative way you can solve puzzles, overcome traps and kill the enemies which try to hinder you.



Main Features

Invoke the ancient magic with your own voice


Use your spells to solve tricky puzzles


Deal with wicked monsters using your arcane powers


Uncover the story of a mysterious main character


Explore the depths of the dangerous Temple




Our team is called Indomitus Games. We are a group of young Italian artists and programmers who have joined forces to develop an innovative gaming product: In Verbis Virtus.
It all began from a university project at the Politecnico di Milano. At the beginning, our group was composed just by few programmers. However, the concept of In Verbis Virtus immediately attracted a lot of interest, so the team quickly grew with graphics and audio specialists that could take care of the artistic aspects of the game. The team now includes:

Here at Indomitus Games we love making games, but creating something like In Verbis Virtus is not that simple. Until today we have put a lot of time and energy and money into this project and we are very proud of what we have achieved so far. We have already published a very early alpha stage playable demo. Since then, we have created much more content of which we showed only a tiny part, and we gathered a quite large community. Yes, we are talking about you, our fans. You are our most valuable asset and now we need your help to complete this ambitious project and bring the world of In Verbis Virtus on your computers.
What is the money for?
Fair question. Basically we need the money for the same things as any other company does: rent, bills, software licenses, personnel, etc... You’re probably wondering whether we need all these money to finish In Verbis Virtus. Believe it or not, it’s not a large sum at all for a video game, and the only reason it’s even cheap is because our staff have voluntereed in the past two years and are willing to work for the bare minimum to try and increase the odds of meeting our goal. Here is a cost breakdown:


$30,000: operating costs (bills, rent, water, pizza) for 8 people for 5 months


$5,500: external contractors


$4,000: software licenses


$2,500: UDK royalties for the crowfunding campaign


$2,500: Voice recording and localization


$4,500: IndieGoGo and payment processing fees

$16,000: Manufacturing and shipping physical rewards
Are you asking to cover all the expenses?
No, not at all. The goal amount we are asking for is about 50% of what the production of In Verbis Virtus actually costs. Until now everyone at Indomitus Games worked for the glory but we can't continue without your support. To complete In Verbis Virtus we need to be able to concentrate only on this project for some months. We will also need to hire qualified professionals to do the work that no one in the team can do (translations, dubbing, etc...). Furthermore commercial licenses of some software are very expensive.
Through crowdfunding you will be able to help us dealing with the difficulties of indie game development. Anyway, you won't do this for nothing in return: we prepared tons of really nice rewards for you!Moreover, as we approach our goal, we can dedicate our time to In Verbis Virtus with more confidence. This means that the sooner we receive your help, the sooner we can deliver the new demo and work toward the final version. So if you intend to contribute, please do so at your earliest possible convenience!Our main goal is to make In Verbis Virtus a great game but why not making it even greater? And what could make a game better than creating it as the players would like it to be?We listened to the requests of our fans for additional features and we chose stretch goals accordingly. Every dollar we gather with this campaign will be used to enhance In Verbis Virtus, but some features will be added after the game release to avoid delaying it. We know you can't wait playing In Verbis Virtus!
Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset designed to make 3D gaming even more immersive. Since it was first announced our fans asked us to support this amazing technology and we would really like to do so! In Verbis Virtus would become a very innovative experience with Oculus Rift.
Today smartphones and tablets are widespread, especially among tech enthusiasts such as our supporters, so we decided to use them to enhance the gaming experience. We would like to develop an app that lets you use mobile devices as your spellbook and journal. Further features will be discussed later.
Leap Motion is an innovative device that enables you to control your computer moving your hands and fingers. Wouldn't it be awesome to cast spells with magic gestures in addition (or alternatively) to magic words?
And then there is something that really a lot of people asked: multiplayer. Nowadays a large number of games allow to play over LAN or on the Internet to take fun to another level. We hope that In Verbis Virtus will be no less than these games, but a multiplayer mode needs infrastructures, additional maps and more. That's why we need further help to reach this objective.

Athena immerses you in the game with its realistic features. You'll aim and pull the trigger to shoot, not just flick a mouse. You'll use the magazine and slide to reload your gun, not just press 'R'. It's wireless too -- as you'd expect any good gun to be. Lighthouse Tracking for Seamless Integration Into Your SteamVR GamesAthena integrates SteamVR, or Lighthouse, tracking. Think of Athena like a Vive controller – with more features. Your games will recognize Athena as a controller and you'll be able to jump right in to the action. Lose Yourself in the GameAthena is a fully tracked SteamVR compatible controller. This means it will work with your HTC Vive headset, as well as any other headset that runs on the SteamVR platform.The controller you see being played with in our video and many of our images is our developer kit, The Persuader. We developed The Persuader to perfect our hardware and to put our controller in the hands of game developers as soon as possible, but Athena is a gamer-ready controller with a new look and some exciting new features.  Athena provides the exact same inputs as the Persuader, with a revamped and more powerful recoil. But the major game-changing (literally) feature is that Athena has integrated SteamVR tracking, which provides a hassle-free user experience (no more mounting your Vive controller!) and seamless integration into SteamVR games. Built With Gamers in MindAthena is the result of over two years of hardware prototyping and working with game developers and gamers around the world. We at Ilium VR have taken everything we’ve learned from our previous controllers and put it into what we think is the most immersive gun controller for virtual reality.  Easy Integrations Into GamesBecause Athena provides more inputs than a standard Vive controller, taking advantage of the full features may require the developer of the game to make slight modifications to utilize this added functionality – such as utilizing the magazine and slide for realistic reloading or using the additional buttons for addition inputs within the game.Our partnered studios, Vertigo Games and Invrse Studios, are bringing you fully featured support for Athena to Arizona Sunshine and The Nest. In addition to these partners, we will maintain a list on our website of all games which take advantage of the full features of Athena.If you are a developer interested in adding our features to your game, please contact us! We'll hook you up with everything you need. It's easy, we promise! Bundled GamesWe want you to get the best experience possible, right away, so we're partnering with two excellent games! At the base tier you will be able to select one of these games which will be included with your controller. If you're really crazy about both and can't decide -- don't worry! There's also a perk that includes both games.Arizona SunshineStep in the midst of a zombie apocalypse as if you were really there, freely move around and explore a post-apocalyptic world, and handle motion-controlled weapons with real-life movements - putting the undead back to rest is more thrilling and satisfying than ever before.Arizona Sunshine is developed by Vertigo Games.The NestThe Nest is a thrilling first-person shooter made custom for motion-controlled VR. Duck, dodge and use cover to avoid incoming projectiles, and gain mastery over the adjustable-zoom sniper scope to dominate your enemies.The Nest is developed by Invrse Studios.How its MadeAthena is made from quality materials -- Strong ABS plastic, with a metal recoil system. The weight will be lighter than a real rifle, no more than five pounds, but with a balanced feel to play for hours without wearing your arms out too much. Athena is compatible with the Vive and any other Lighthouse/SteamVR tracking products -- Ilium VR is part of the SteamVR licensing program to officially bring this technology to our platform. The controller is completely wireless -- charges in about 45 minutes and will last for 10-15 hours of active gameplay.Where Are My Funds Going?Good question! Short answer: Manufacturing costs.Over the last two years, we've gone through many iterations of this product  -- doing all development and assembly in-house. With our developer program units, this worked great -- providing us the flexibility of going back and forth with developers to hone our design.But if we are going to produce Athena at scale, we can’t do it alone. We're hardware and software developers -- not large scale manufacturers. To get us over the hurdle of mass production, we’ve enlisted the help of manufacturers to produce Athena at quantity. This allows us to focus our efforts doing what we’re really good at— making your VR experience so real you forget you’re in a game.This is where you come in! We chose crowdfunding because since our inception, Ilium VR has been fueled by the VR community. It’s always been about working with one another to create the most immersive peripherals possible.

<p>4 more days. We realize that there's a lot of chance that we won't reach our $2000 goal. Comparing to most campaign on indiegogo, this is a ""do or die"" campaign. That means we won't get anything if we don't reach our goal. <br/><br/>We'll re-evaluate our option for the development on iOS (iphone / ipad) and Windows phone. We can already assure you that they'll be less content on the free version comparing to what we offer on Android.<br/><br/>For those who already contribute and will contribute in the next 4 days, for whatever donation you will give us, we'll give you the full version of our game on Android, iOS and Windows phone to thank you for supporting this project.<br/><br/>Finally,  Gravity Bound has reach 2000 downloads yesterday! Thank everyone for supporting us in this great adventure we started 4 months ago! We would like to thank everyone who helped us in our campaign. We really appreciate.</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p>Our story began as three young Montreal video game addicts who had a common dream: to create a renowned video game and software company.  And so… Maitop was born!</p>
<p>Together, in these hard economic times, we wanted to share our passion for gaming by giving it back to the world. Created from this passion was a project named Gravity Bounds. Our goal was to create a great quality video game with the smallest budget possible; mostly using our personal time. In this adventure of ours, we all worked together for more than 1000 hours while keeping our daily jobs to pay development costs and our personal bills.</p>
<p>From all of this hard work came the fruit of our labor, Gravity Bounds. Our first game built and released on the Android platform on December 16, 2011. Our first goal has successfully been completed, but we’ve now hit an economic wall and that’s the reason we are asking for help from the community.</p>
<h3><strong>Why we need your help</strong></h3>
<p>We are doing this campaign so we can continue to share our passion with more people.  Our goal is to raise enough money allowing us to purchase hardware that will enable us to develop ports to the iOS and Windows Mobile platforms. We’ll use the extra money to develop a new achievements and skins system. It’ll enable you to change the look of every balls, objects and tiles in the game. Achievements will give you some milestones to achieve in order to unlock these skins.</p>
<p>We also want to keep gravity bounds lite with a lot of contents. To give you an idea, Gravity Bounds ""lite"" on Android has 100 levels out of 120 (the last 20 are in the full version). We would like to be able to offer the same to iPhone and Windows phone user.</p>
<h3><strong>What you'll get</strong></h3>
<p>We want to express our gratitude for all of your pledge and give something back.  We shall be sending all sorts of goodies out like T-Shirts, coffee mugs, or ‘thank you!’ letters and promotional spots in our free version of the game.</p>
<p>We as gamers are proud to be giving back to our fellow gaming community. We want to provide more challenging games like this in the future for free.

<p>Gravity Bounds is a brain mind retro puzzle game. The goal is to get all of the balls on the screen together to clear them. The catch is, when you move the game stage in a direction, every object goes in that direction.  Advancing leads to many new obstacles that hinder your progression to ultimate victory! If you would like a preview of what Gravity Bounds has in store, take a look at our new promotional video we made at the top of this page.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Edgar, I am founder of an independent game development studio <strong>ZIPSTED</strong>.</p>
<p>We started in 2012 and since then we've developed three small mobile games for iOS: SOPOR, Fridge Break, and Tapobang. They still live on App Store, and I made them free while Indiegogo campaign is continuing. <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/ru/developer/edgar-letner/id767222144"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Look to them</a>, if you'd like.</p>
<p>In 2016 I decided to create something bigger. At that date I've read a sci-fi novel <strong>Prisoners of Power</strong> by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky and found the book amazing. A month later I've wrote first few lines of <strong>INZIPID</strong> code and modeled the first version of the main character. I was pretty familiar with Unity engine, so development has begun fine.</p>
<p>The only obstacle I've met was a <strong>time</strong>. I'm working on INZIPID almost every day after my full-time job for about a year, and currently developed gameplay lasts a little more than an hour. Meanwhile, I have a plot, which approximately corresponds to 6-8 hours of gameplay. So, we've got a simple proportion here. If I leave things as is, I need 6-8 years to complete INZIPID and release it. The only way out is to work on the game 60 hours per week instead of 10 hours.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm pretty sure<strong> I cannot do this without your help</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508833719/kj0ovzndhhvxvozcr20t.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>INZIPID is inspired by sci-fi novel Prisoners of Power, and placed in the world of machines. It is a 2.5D platformer in an atmosphere of desolation and lifelessness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cinematic plot makes player feel and worry with the main character</li>
<li>Tragic and perceptible conflict between two races of robots</li>
<li>Dilapidating civilization of artificial intelligence</li>
<li>About 150 puzzles and interactive locations</li>
<li>About 30 unique characters</li>
</ul>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/2S7O4fd.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Inspiration from Prisoners of Power</h3>
<p>Shortly about the novel plot (excerpted from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_Power"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wikipedia</a>). The hero of the story is a space explorer from Earth. He accidentally discovers a planet inhabited by a humanoid race. The man finds himself in the capital of a totalitarian state, perpetually at war with its neighbors. The population is governed by an anonymous oligarchy with police and military omnipresent. Eventually, it is revealed that to maintain the loyalty of the population, the oligarchy employ mind control broadcasts. The broadcast towers pepper the landscape of the country. Constant broadcasts suppress the ability to evaluate information critically. In addition, twice a day, intense broadcasts relieve mental stress caused by the disconnect between the propaganda and the observed reality by inducing an outburst of blinding enthusiasm.</p>
<p>A minority of the population are not susceptible to the broadcasts. In these people, the intense daily broadcasts induce horrible headache and seizures. The people that are not susceptible to the broadcasts are branded degenerates or degens by the state. They are actively persecuted. When captured they are either executed or sent to prison.</p>
<h3>INZIPID Plot</h3>
<p>The main character is a human-looking robot. He wakes up somewhere and do not figure out where he is and what is happening. He starts to explore the world and finds friendly blue-eyed robots, who help him on his way. Later he meets more characters, which do not treat well to the main character. For example, yellow-eyed robots. Yellow-eyed robots are in conflict with blue-eyed robots for some reason. Discovering the game world player finds out that all local robots are sensitive to broadcasting, but if yellow-eyed robot becomes raging and aggressive, than blue-eyed robot feels pain and loses ability to resist. Only the main character does feel nothing from broadcasting.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/yNvjim4.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>But who did develop broadcasting and why? Can be those cute little robots angry and evil? Are there more robot races? Why is the main character not affected by the broadcasting? Gameplay answers to these and much more questions.</p>

<p>There are a lot of locations in INZIPID: military zone, office building, factory producing towers, canalisation, police station, ghetto with gameplay on roofs, entire island with its own architecture, stadium, train station, and so on. But let me show you the atmosphere.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508451641/gpmo9czuzpagqc8tcdhf.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://zipsted.com/characters/all-characters.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All INZIPID characters are machines. They may look like humans, animals, plants, or insects, but don't let them deceive you -- they are still just robots. I can't say that there are a lot of characters in the game, but there are as many characters as needed to tell the whole story. <i>Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity. </i>Very few INZIPID robots appear in the game more than twice. Since INZIPID denies the existence of terms ""good"" and ""evil"", there are no simply good or bad guys in the game. If you find somebody in the game helping you, that doesn't mean he doesn't do horrible thing in the future. Every character has its motivation to do or do not things during gameplay.<br/>Each character is created by hand in Blender3D with huge author's love. Some of them are animated in Blender, others become alive in Unity engine directly.</p>

<p>I know you do not trust game developers here on Indiegogo. I can not blame you for that, there are a number of examples when successfully funded campaign did not end up with game release. I will never be able to assure you, that I'm not the one of them, but I can show you few facts about me, which I can prove or they are obvious by themselves.</p>

</div></div>","Hi, my name is Edgar, I am founder of an independent game development studio ZIPSTED.
We started in 2012 and since then we've developed three small mobile games for iOS: SOPOR, Fridge Break, and Tapobang. They still live on App Store, and I made them free while Indiegogo campaign is continuing. Look to them, if you'd like.
In 2016 I decided to create something bigger. At that date I've read a sci-fi novel Prisoners of Power by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky and found the book amazing. A month later I've wrote first few lines of INZIPID code and modeled the first version of the main character. I was pretty familiar with Unity engine, so development has begun fine.
The only obstacle I've met was a time. I'm working on INZIPID almost every day after my full-time job for about a year, and currently developed gameplay lasts a little more than an hour. Meanwhile, I have a plot, which approximately corresponds to 6-8 hours of gameplay. So, we've got a simple proportion here. If I leave things as is, I need 6-8 years to complete INZIPID and release it. The only way out is to work on the game 60 hours per week instead of 10 hours.
In other words, I'm pretty sure I cannot do this without your help.

INZIPID is inspired by sci-fi novel Prisoners of Power, and placed in the world of machines. It is a 2.5D platformer in an atmosphere of desolation and lifelessness.

Cinematic plot makes player feel and worry with the main character
Tragic and perceptible conflict between two races of robots
Dilapidating civilization of artificial intelligence
About 150 puzzles and interactive locations
About 30 unique characters



Inspiration from Prisoners of Power
Shortly about the novel plot (excerpted from Wikipedia). The hero of the story is a space explorer from Earth. He accidentally discovers a planet inhabited by a humanoid race. The man finds himself in the capital of a totalitarian state, perpetually at war with its neighbors. The population is governed by an anonymous oligarchy with police and military omnipresent. Eventually, it is revealed that to maintain the loyalty of the population, the oligarchy employ mind control broadcasts. The broadcast towers pepper the landscape of the country. Constant broadcasts suppress the ability to evaluate information critically. In addition, twice a day, intense broadcasts relieve mental stress caused by the disconnect between the propaganda and the observed reality by inducing an outburst of blinding enthusiasm.
A minority of the population are not susceptible to the broadcasts. In these people, the intense daily broadcasts induce horrible headache and seizures. The people that are not susceptible to the broadcasts are branded degenerates or degens by the state. They are actively persecuted. When captured they are either executed or sent to prison.
INZIPID Plot
The main character is a human-looking robot. He wakes up somewhere and do not figure out where he is and what is happening. He starts to explore the world and finds friendly blue-eyed robots, who help him on his way. Later he meets more characters, which do not treat well to the main character. For example, yellow-eyed robots. Yellow-eyed robots are in conflict with blue-eyed robots for some reason. Discovering the game world player finds out that all local robots are sensitive to broadcasting, but if yellow-eyed robot becomes raging and aggressive, than blue-eyed robot feels pain and loses ability to resist. Only the main character does feel nothing from broadcasting.

But who did develop broadcasting and why? Can be those cute little robots angry and evil? Are there more robot races? Why is the main character not affected by the broadcasting? Gameplay answers to these and much more questions.

There are a lot of locations in INZIPID: military zone, office building, factory producing towers, canalisation, police station, ghetto with gameplay on roofs, entire island with its own architecture, stadium, train station, and so on. But let me show you the atmosphere.




 


All INZIPID characters are machines. They may look like humans, animals, plants, or insects, but don't let them deceive you -- they are still just robots. I can't say that there are a lot of characters in the game, but there are as many characters as needed to tell the whole story. Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity. Very few INZIPID robots appear in the game more than twice. Since INZIPID denies the existence of terms ""good"" and ""evil"", there are no simply good or bad guys in the game. If you find somebody in the game helping you, that doesn't mean he doesn't do horrible thing in the future. Every character has its motivation to do or do not things during gameplay.Each character is created by hand in Blender3D with huge author's love. Some of them are animated in Blender, others become alive in Unity engine directly.

I know you do not trust game developers here on Indiegogo. I can not blame you for that, there are a number of examples when successfully funded campaign did not end up with game release. I will never be able to assure you, that I'm not the one of them, but I can show you few facts about me, which I can prove or they are obvious by themselves.


All my game projects always come to release. I'm developing video games since 2012, and my games are not as successful as I've ever expected, but if I start the project it will be done for sure. Here's the link to the first documented mention of my game SOPOR, and this link proves that SOPOR had been released and still alive. Told about Fridge Break and released it. Tapobang mention and its release.

I do not need a million, or even a half of a million. All I need is a year of game development without distracting factors and side-projects. Actually, I understand those guys, who successfully funded their games, have looked at their bank account, and lost their enthusiasm to continue development. $500,000 can blind anyone. In my case, I need $77,000, which I will spend on salary compensation for me as a programmer, salary for third-party artist/designer (it will help to model all the stuff in an annual term), platform and banking fees, taxes, and relatively cheap things like modern PS4 (I already have PC, Mac, and Xbox), UI localization, and marketing/PR.
Everyone knows that Kickstarter campaigns for video games are more efficient. Statistically. But there is at least one problem with Kickstarter for video games -- the platform accepts only a few countries to start a campaign. I'm from Russia, which is not in Kickstarter list, and I'm not going to use dirty semi-legal schemes to set up INZIPID campaign from third country. So, I show my project here, to you, and I trust in your sense of beauty.

Fixed goal. I need a year of development, and ""float campaign"" will not help me to reach that goal. Nobody will happy to receive a half (or fifth part) of the game in release. So, all or nothing.

know us better. I can’t say that we are professionals, but we definitely
 know what makes a <b>great game</b>. </p>
<p>  <b>Currently</b> there are only <b>4</b> of us, which is not big, but we hope, we will find people who <b>can help our game grow</b>. It was our dream as players to <b>make a game</b>, and now is the time, when we got together and with right materials and ideas we  started to <b>work on this project</b>. We always had <b>very good ideas</b>
 on how a game should work,  that’s  why we thought that creating one 
would help us accomplish our dream and it would fill the needs of a 
passionate gamer. </p>
<p>  We are also just players, the <b>idea of creating a game</b> came from watching and playing other games, <b>we wanted to create something different a special</b> thing that would make the player feel like he was in the game, like he was <b>living the life</b> of the main character's story. It’s not possible to just simply make a game, there has to be time, <i>passion</i>, <b>creativity</b>, <i>ideas</i>, <b>people</b>, <i>and of course you our fan base</i> you are the ones, who will help us to make a good, interesting and fun to play game.</p>
<p>  I <b>hope</b> that you’ll know even more about us as we’ll <b>progress</b> with <b>our game</b> and, that you’ll give us <b>usefull ideas</b> and help to us to create a <b>succesfull game</b>. To keep it short so it is not boring, we can assure as a <b>fellow gamers/players</b> that we will do our best to create something that <b>you’ll enjoy</b>.
As most of players we thought about <b>creating a game</b>,  but those ideas  are always just words so we decided to take matters in <b>our own hands</b>. We are senior students in high school, with brilliant ideas and interest in game development industry. </p>
<p>  So to give you an idea about who we are, I will tell you something about each member of our project. </p>
<p>- Let’s start with <b>Lukas</b> <i>lead creator and director of the game</i>,
  he  got the whole project together so he was the initiative to create 
our game.  He is the most creative member of the group, so thanks to him 
you’ll have a great story with lot of twist and mysteries. He started 
using his fantasy in an effort to write a novel, where he also used his 
ability to create  breathtaking scenes and deeper sense. He wanted to 
transform his thoughts into virtual reality. </p>
<p>- My name is <b>Peter</b> I’m game <i>lead programmer</i>
 and I also like writing a lot. I don’t like talking about myself much 
but let me give you at least some information. When I heard the idea, 
that Lukas created I was very interested  and wanted to include my ideas
 and opinions on the game. Now something more personal about me, as you 
can see I like writing as I already told you and I enjoy learning about 
new cultures and languages, my current passion is Asia don’t worry it 
won’t affect the game :).  I'm working on the gameplay side of the game, so
 if you find a bug you can blame me for that. </p>
<p>-	And the newest member of our team <b>Zuzana</b> and the only lady. She is a <i>head story editor</i>
 the person who you’ll love because of the amazing story, that she edited
 and created. Her ambitions are to became a book writer. We became very 
depended on her because of her ideas on the story line, you’ll see for 
yourself.  As she is the only lady in our team, we can rely on her with 
things, that we are not good at or lazy about. Zuzana was also interested, 
like me with the Lukas idea and wanted to become a part of it. </p>
<p><i>Unfortunetly we can’t introduce the fourth member at the time being. </i></p>

<p>There are some <b>informations</b>, <i>what we want to tell you</i>. First of all, we are using some default stuff from <i>cryengine in our presentation</i>. Why? In this campaign, <b>game features and our systems</b> are more important for us. We wanted to show you, what is <i>unique</i> in our game.

<div>
<p>Let me <b>give a you</b> brief explanation about what our <i>game features</i>. So 
I’m going to talk about some of them.
You now  know that, we wanted to create a <i>realistic world</i> with a <i>lot of 
opportunities</i>, <i>choices</i> and <i>options</i> for a player. We want you to <i>enjoy</i> it
 as <b>much as you can</b>, that’s why it’s important to <i>feel like you are part 
of the game itself. </i></p>
<p>Let’s see first of all:</p>
<p><b>NPC system</b>
 : Creating just some NPC’s that you’ll talk to, that doesn’t work for 
us. We made them little bit more dynamic. They can help you questing, 
adventuring around SEVENA, fighting off your enemies. Choose whoever you
 want, who looks  more to your liking. Make them drive you around if you 
are lazy to drive. </p>
<p><b>Combat</b> : The most important part of a 
RPG shooter is combat, so we are giving you a good combat system that you
 can work with. Combat in our game can drastically change depending on 
the weather, youre visibility, precision, shot trajectory. If I was you I
 would pay closer attention to the current weather </p>
<ul>
<li>-	<i>Editing your weapon</i>, choosing attachemants that you like from our special illegal store. Or buy the whole weapon from friendly fire shops. </li>
<li>- <i>Casino system</i> : If you feel lucky and have money to spend, try our casinos it can be a risk, but you can get some valuable prices too. </li>
<li>-	<i>Night clubs</i> for those party animals, dance machines out there who like to have some fun.</li>
<li>
-	<i>Inventory system</i>   we feel like most of the games have unlimited
 space, you have tons and tons of weapons and things. Because we like 
things more realistic, you’ll have enough space but you have complete 
some requirements for example smaller gun needs a holster, for shotgun 
longer jacket. And you can place your weapons and ammo in the truck of 
your car for more space. </li>
<li>-	<b>Dynamic events,  dynamic weather</b> : </li>
<li>Like in real world anything can happen in just a second. You can be 
in a bar and event will pop something like a bar fight. When you have 
good enough car street racers can recognize you and ask you to join them
 in a race. There will be lot more I’m just giving you an example. </li>
<li>
<i>Dynamic weather</i> – we like to have night time, day time , all four
 seasons , one day will be sunny, one rainy it will change randomly so 
don’t forget to take your umbrellas. There is 24 minutes cycle of night &amp; day system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>-	<i>Owning an estate</i>, car -  if you want to get more money get a 
building that you can profit from, you  can also sell  the whole thing 
if you need some quick cash. The same goes for cars you can edit, buy, 
sell, steal all cars that are in the game. </li>
<li>-	<i>You’re family owns</i> a lot of properties and territories, but
 the same goes for other mafia family. When you own an territory it’s 
yours you are getting some benefits, earning more money, and giving 
yourself a place to fight for. It’s your land so you have to defend it 
against your enemy, in the game you will have lot of massive fights over
 your territories giving you the experience of real mafia fight. Get 
some of your buddies and capture the enemy territory. </li>
<li>
-<i>	Interaction with civilians</i> is important too. Your behaviour 
plays a big role, you can be a hero to people if you are helping them 
with their daily lives or a bully. Depending on at they can help you but
 they can also give information to your enemy it all depends on your 
actions. </li>
<li>-	<i>CO-OP system</i> : You are always bored in world just by 
yourself, we created good CO-OP system. Instead of NPCs you can invite 
one of your friends, use the options of an open world activities that 
SEVENA island offers.</li>
<li>
-	<i>Easter eggs,</i> Achievements will also have a role in our game, if 
like to explore complete all achievements you won’t be disappointed we 
prepared a good amout of things that you can do and you’ll get rewards 
for your spent time. </li>
<li>-	<i>HP</i> : Don’t expect to take more that one bullet, everything 
has a value you have to be carefull with your body. If you are in an 
action and you don’t have time you can use adrenalin that will help you 
fight even with pain but only for a period of time. Later you have to 
visit a doctor if it’s a bigger wound or a bullet shot, he will fix you 
in no time. My advice to you try not getting shot. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<i>Police </i>- our policemans are very realistic, like in real life. They will punish you for speed limits, when you go on red-light, traffic accidents and most of other realistic elements.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And there is our RPG site of our game. You’ll have a choice between 3 different play styles:</p>
<ul>
<li> 1. <i>Combat</i>,                                 2<i>.Sneaking</i>,                            3.<i>Leadership</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Combat
:</b> for your typical front line guy that just kills with
no mercy<b>. </b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Sneaking :</b> if you
prefer a sneakier way of dealing with things this is the right class for you.
Play as sniper patiently waiting for it’s prey to be hunted down. Sneak behind
your enemies, find their weak spots, kill them quicker, faster and efficiently.
</li>
<li>
<b>Leadership :</b>You are not a type of person who
deals with everything on his own, with your leadership abilities this will give
you an easier time. You’ll be someone who everyone admires and would do
anything for them. Lead you family to success and progress, capture areas that
you don’t own yet.</li>
<li>We built one of the most revolutionary system in the game development  - </li>
<li>
<b>Friendly Controller</b>, is a thing, which can make your Friendly(buddy) more inteligent. For example: in action, you can give him multiple commands to do what you need and what is best in the current situation for you. You can really enjoy your position of a true Leader. Friendly Controller is fixed on Leadership Skill from the  biggest part.</li>
</ul>

<p><span>In
 <b>action 1</b> we used ""<i>Drive</i>"" and in <b>action 2</b> we used ""<i>Move</i>"". That allows 
you to make a <i>simple</i>, but <b>usefull</b> way on how to clear your enemy

</div>
</div></div>","For start we want to introduce ourselves so you’ll get to 
know us better. I can’t say that we are professionals, but we definitely
 know what makes a great game. 
  Currently there are only 4 of us, which is not big, but we hope, we will find people who can help our game grow. It was our dream as players to make a game, and now is the time, when we got together and with right materials and ideas we  started to work on this project. We always had very good ideas
 on how a game should work,  that’s  why we thought that creating one 
would help us accomplish our dream and it would fill the needs of a 
passionate gamer. 
  We are also just players, the idea of creating a game came from watching and playing other games, we wanted to create something different a special thing that would make the player feel like he was in the game, like he was living the life of the main character's story. It’s not possible to just simply make a game, there has to be time, passion, creativity, ideas, people, and of course you our fan base you are the ones, who will help us to make a good, interesting and fun to play game.
  I hope that you’ll know even more about us as we’ll progress with our game and, that you’ll give us usefull ideas and help to us to create a succesfull game. To keep it short so it is not boring, we can assure as a fellow gamers/players that we will do our best to create something that you’ll enjoy.
As most of players we thought about creating a game,  but those ideas  are always just words so we decided to take matters in our own hands. We are senior students in high school, with brilliant ideas and interest in game development industry. 
  So to give you an idea about who we are, I will tell you something about each member of our project. 
- Let’s start with Lukas lead creator and director of the game,
  he  got the whole project together so he was the initiative to create 
our game.  He is the most creative member of the group, so thanks to him 
you’ll have a great story with lot of twist and mysteries. He started 
using his fantasy in an effort to write a novel, where he also used his 
ability to create  breathtaking scenes and deeper sense. He wanted to 
transform his thoughts into virtual reality. 
- My name is Peter I’m game lead programmer
 and I also like writing a lot. I don’t like talking about myself much 
but let me give you at least some information. When I heard the idea, 
that Lukas created I was very interested  and wanted to include my ideas
 and opinions on the game. Now something more personal about me, as you 
can see I like writing as I already told you and I enjoy learning about 
new cultures and languages, my current passion is Asia don’t worry it 
won’t affect the game :).  I'm working on the gameplay side of the game, so
 if you find a bug you can blame me for that. 
-	And the newest member of our team Zuzana and the only lady. She is a head story editor
 the person who you’ll love because of the amazing story, that she edited
 and created. Her ambitions are to became a book writer. We became very 
depended on her because of her ideas on the story line, you’ll see for 
yourself.  As she is the only lady in our team, we can rely on her with 
things, that we are not good at or lazy about. Zuzana was also interested, 
like me with the Lukas idea and wanted to become a part of it. 
Unfortunetly we can’t introduce the fourth member at the time being. 




There are some informations, what we want to tell you. First of all, we are using some default stuff from cryengine in our presentation. Why? In this campaign, game features and our systems are more important for us. We wanted to show you, what is unique in our game. So, that's the reason, why we didn't spend much time with models. But in this time, behind the campaign, we are working on it. So, you will see it in our future updates. 
If you don´t understand us in the video, you have our sorry. We are from Slovakia, so, it's little more problematic for us. Please, turn on captions in the video, if you have problem with understanding us.







Let me give a you brief explanation about what our game features. So 
I’m going to talk about some of them.
You now  know that, we wanted to create a realistic world with a lot of 
opportunities, choices and options for a player. We want you to enjoy it
 as much as you can, that’s why it’s important to feel like you are part 
of the game itself. 
Let’s see first of all:
NPC system
 : Creating just some NPC’s that you’ll talk to, that doesn’t work for 
us. We made them little bit more dynamic. They can help you questing, 
adventuring around SEVENA, fighting off your enemies. Choose whoever you
 want, who looks  more to your liking. Make them drive you around if you 
are lazy to drive. 
Combat : The most important part of a 
RPG shooter is combat, so we are giving you a good combat system that you
 can work with. Combat in our game can drastically change depending on 
the weather, youre visibility, precision, shot trajectory. If I was you I
 would pay closer attention to the current weather 

-	Editing your weapon, choosing attachemants that you like from our special illegal store. Or buy the whole weapon from friendly fire shops. 
- Casino system : If you feel lucky and have money to spend, try our casinos it can be a risk, but you can get some valuable prices too. 
-	Night clubs for those party animals, dance machines out there who like to have some fun.

-	Inventory system   we feel like most of the games have unlimited
 space, you have tons and tons of weapons and things. Because we like 
things more realistic, you’ll have enough space but you have complete 
some requirements for example smaller gun needs a holster, for shotgun 
longer jacket. And you can place your weapons and ammo in the truck of 
your car for more space. 
-	Dynamic events,  dynamic weather : 
Like in real world anything can happen in just a second. You can be 
in a bar and event will pop something like a bar fight. When you have 
good enough car street racers can recognize you and ask you to join them
 in a race. There will be lot more I’m just giving you an example. 

Dynamic weather – we like to have night time, day time , all four
 seasons , one day will be sunny, one rainy it will change randomly so 
don’t forget to take your umbrellas. There is 24 minutes cycle of night & day system.


-	Owning an estate, car -  if you want to get more money get a 
building that you can profit from, you  can also sell  the whole thing 
if you need some quick cash. The same goes for cars you can edit, buy, 
sell, steal all cars that are in the game. 
-	You’re family owns a lot of properties and territories, but
 the same goes for other mafia family. When you own an territory it’s 
yours you are getting some benefits, earning more money, and giving 
yourself a place to fight for. It’s your land so you have to defend it 
against your enemy, in the game you will have lot of massive fights over
 your territories giving you the experience of real mafia fight. Get 
some of your buddies and capture the enemy territory. 

-	Interaction with civilians is important too. Your behaviour 
plays a big role, you can be a hero to people if you are helping them 
with their daily lives or a bully. Depending on at they can help you but
 they can also give information to your enemy it all depends on your 
actions. 
-	CO-OP system : You are always bored in world just by 
yourself, we created good CO-OP system. Instead of NPCs you can invite 
one of your friends, use the options of an open world activities that 
SEVENA island offers.

-	Easter eggs, Achievements will also have a role in our game, if 
like to explore complete all achievements you won’t be disappointed we 
prepared a good amout of things that you can do and you’ll get rewards 
for your spent time. 
-	HP : Don’t expect to take more that one bullet, everything 
has a value you have to be carefull with your body. If you are in an 
action and you don’t have time you can use adrenalin that will help you 
fight even with pain but only for a period of time. Later you have to 
visit a doctor if it’s a bigger wound or a bullet shot, he will fix you 
in no time. My advice to you try not getting shot. 


Police - our policemans are very realistic, like in real life. They will punish you for speed limits, when you go on red-light, traffic accidents and most of other realistic elements.


And there is our RPG site of our game. You’ll have a choice between 3 different play styles:

 1. Combat,                                 2.Sneaking,                            3.Leadership


Combat
: for your typical front line guy that just kills with
no mercy. 


Sneaking : if you
prefer a sneakier way of dealing with things this is the right class for you.
Play as sniper patiently waiting for it’s prey to be hunted down. Sneak behind
your enemies, find their weak spots, kill them quicker, faster and efficiently.


Leadership :You are not a type of person who
deals with everything on his own, with your leadership abilities this will give
you an easier time. You’ll be someone who everyone admires and would do
anything for them. Lead you family to success and progress, capture areas that
you don’t own yet.
We built one of the most revolutionary system in the game development  - 

Friendly Controller, is a thing, which can make your Friendly(buddy) more inteligent. For example: in action, you can give him multiple commands to do what you need and what is best in the current situation for you. You can really enjoy your position of a true Leader. Friendly Controller is fixed on Leadership Skill from the  biggest part.




In
 action 1 we used ""Drive"" and in action 2 we used ""Move"". That allows 
you to make a simple, but usefull way on how to clear your enemy 
territory with the help of your buddy. You can see this function in the 
campaing video. All of these actions, can be activated just by pressing a
 hotkey.





Our world is very specific. We wanted to build something new and special. Sevena Islands are inspired by places like Miami, Florida, Hawai, so it´s a tropical paradise. Everything that is on Sevena Islands, can not be seen enywhere else only in our game. We wanted to make something what you can't see in other places on  Earth, so that's why we created this land. Game will instantly put you into a new world, new culture full of interesting history (which are figures like easter eggs). You can see more on ""Game Features"" in ""Dynamic Events"" and you can see how much is our world living.
In the presentation, you can see only 1% of our map, and even that 1% is quite large. So, that means, that our map will be very, very, very big. Our map resolution will be something about 10-thousand km2 and that's pretty huge. In the picture you can see, that 1% of our map (in the red circle) and other parts that we are working on.





Story is something, what is very important for us. We want to include feelings into the story writing, so with this, we can control player´s emotion. Our fantasy in this way is very big, maybe unlimited, however, when you are playing a game, we are aiming on your emotions, because only with that, you can fully enjoy the whole game. Our story line is full of plots, so thats the reason, why our story is so great. While playing, you will be revealing lot of new facts about Sevena Islands, intrigues in Tate's family and everything else. You will play in present day, nothing like a specific date, but you will see it in our game, what kind of century it is. 
Main character of our story is a young man, Francis Tate, who is called to the mafia wars because of the loyalty to his family. He just felt the need to protect every last thing, which his family owns, after his father died. Our story is not about revenge. It's on you, how you'll take it. One of very important characters in our game, is Francis´s step-brother, Clarence, who is adopted. He will mix the cards through the whole story line. There are more important characters, but in this time, we don't want to tell you(spoil) every detail of our very dramatic story line. 


This is one of main characters. She is a member of corporation ""EFD"", I can't tell you more details about this thing in our story(maybe in another update ;) ), but it´s very interesting part of the game.
Strength
 and options of Cryengine were one of the most decisive factors, when 
choosing an engine, that we wanted to work with. The software itself 
""Sanbox"" is most usefull for us. Options and flexibility of Cryengine 
were on the first place in our selection.
Our aim is to create a special game, that will build its name in the game industry. We want to continue on our path. Project SEVENA is not our only project.  We have lot of ideas, which we wanted to bring to life. Project SEVENA is not an ordinary gaming project, we want to bring our hearts to this project and with this we are aiming to the clouds of AAA titles.






When creating our dream, we thought about things like, how we are going to pay for our project. We tried to find investors who would support our idea but we didn't succeed, because most people are not interested in things which are not fully developt. That why we took things in our own hands and started working hard on our thoughts, ideas and dreams. Except getting our finances, we realized that the best thing for our project will be to get financial support from you, the player comunity, and also we need feedback from our potentional players - that's the reason why we are here.




Your support is very important for our success. You can give us feedback, and you can help us to grow our project. 
With your support, we can make our game better. We want to make our characters with 3D Scan. For animations we want to use MOCAP and other things, that we need for our job
We wanted too make our studio bigger, so, we could be a real game development studio with more people and with it's name on the market.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i>Please scroll down for the English summary!</i><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Die Tatsache</b></p>
<p>In Bonn fehlt was! Und
auch in der Umgebung! Ein Ort für Fantasy-Freunde und Spiele-Fans – eine
Anlaufstelle für alte Hasen und frische Neugierige, an der man auch noch in
passendem Ambiente bewirtet wird. </p>
<p><b>Die Vision</b></p>
<p>Wir wollen das ändern und
im schönen Bonn ein Spiele-Café und Fantasy-Pub eröffnen, als besonderen
Treffpunkt mit Atmosphäre und Gemütlichkeit. Dort werden alle möglichen Sorten
von <b>Spielen</b> vertreten sein:
Gesellschaftsspiele, Rollenspiele, Platz für Table Tops, Spiele-Turniere und
auch Demo-Runden. Dazu stellen wir uns ein ausgiebiges <b>Veranstaltungsprogramm</b> vor mit Themenpartys zu aktuellen und
klassischen Fantasy- und Science Fiction-Genres, hin und wieder auch was Historisches
und Literarisches, Lesungen, Workshops, Bierproben, Konzerte etc.</p>
<p>Ihr könnt dann auch gerne
selber etwas anbieten!</p>
<p>Damit zudem die
Geschmackssinne etwas zu tun bekommen, bieten wir ein spannendes <b>Getränke</b>-Angebot: Biere aus dem Ausland
oder weiter entfernten, deutschen Regionen. Kennt Ihr z.B. Lambic oder
Trappistenbier? Dubbel- oder Tripelbier? Wisst ihr, was für tolle Sachen im
Fränkischen gebraut werden? Außerdem gibt es verschiedene Metsorten, historische
Gewürzweine, seltene Limonaden usw. Dazu haben wir kleine <b>Speisen,</b> von Muffins bis Pommes und Burger. Die idealen Snacks zum
Spielen.</p>
<p>Selbstredend können wir uns
ebenfalls gut vorstellen, mit verschiedenen Einrichtungen im Bereich der
gemeinnützigen Tätigkeit <span>zusammenzuarbeiten. Wir sind
immer offen für Gespräche.</span></p>
<p><b>Wer sind wir?</b></p>
<p><b>Astrid</b>. Arbeitet mit bei
Crimson Darkness, der Hörnchen-Manufaktur und turnt mit denen seit acht Jahren
über die Cons, Messen, Märkte und Festivals. Sie ist an und für sich
Archäologin, Mediävistin und passionierter Fantasy-Fan. Im Voyager wird sie zur
Herrin der Küche und der Lagerauffüllung. Ihr kennt wahrscheinlich schon ihre
Kekse – sie kann auch noch mehr!</p>
<p><b>Kay</b>. Ist auch schon seit
Jahren bei Crimson Darkness. Er kann Diplom-Bibliothekar und hat viel im
kaufmännischen gearbeitet. Seine Liebe gilt alter Fantasy und Science Fiction,
egal ob Buch oder Film. Ihm wird die Theke zu Untertan sein. </p>
<p>Beide Chefs zusammen
werden sich um sämtliche Organisation und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit kümmern. Auch
wenn wir nicht immer einwandfrei rechts und links unterscheiden können, wissen
wir dennoch, was die rechte und die linke Hand des Anderen tut!</p>
<p>Unser Team wird außerdem unterstützt
durch das Meister-Hörnchen Atma Sinnan selber. Sie wird uns in allen praktischen
Design- und Ausstattungsfragen behilflich sein. Hörnchens Bruder Max wird uns
vor Ort gekonnt durch die Untiefen der Buchhaltung führen, und Kay sein Bruder
Maik erhält die handwerkliche Supervision auf dem Voyager-Boot.</p>
<p><b>Wer darf zu uns kommen?</b></p>
<p>Das ist mal
eine Frage! Na, Ihr alle!!! Jung und alt, dick und dünn, Männlein, Weiblein,
Ork und Elf, Pirat und Klingone... Menschen? Ja, die dürfen auch rein! Wir
öffnen die Pforten für jede Art von Noob und Nerd! Wissen, was ein Würfel ist,
kann auch nicht schaden. Nur wer ein Casino sucht, ist bei uns leider falsch.
Ihr dürft so viel spielen, wie Ihr wollt.. Ihr müsst aber nicht!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Was wir schon haben</b></p>
<p>Wir haben mit ein wenig
professioneller Hilfe einen langen (sehr langen) Businessplan geschrieben. Wir
haben uns das künftige Veranstaltungsprogramm ausgedacht und geplant, jede
Menge Dekorationsideen und sowohl Speise- als auch Getränkeauswahl für Euch
fertig entwickelt. </p>
<p>Von uns gestartete
Umfragen haben viel positives Feedback und weitere Anregungen ergeben, die wir
zu einem gar nicht mal so kleinen Teil bereits eingeplant oder umgesetzt haben.</p>
<p>Und tatsächlich: Wir
hätten sogar schon einen Laden in Aussicht, der genau unseren räumlichen
Erfordernissen und Vorstellungen entspräche! Eigentlich könnten wir uns den
schnappen und loslegen… aber…</p>
<p><b>Was wir noch brauchen</b></p>
<p>Da wir schon so fleißig
waren, brauchen wir nur noch das, was im Grunde alle brauchen: Geld. </p>
<p>Es gibt reichlich Dinge,
die finanzieren werden möchten: Die Location will ein bisschen renoviert und umdekoriert
werden. Bei Küche und Theke müssen wir noch mal bei. Dazu fehlen noch einige Möbel, viele Spiele (denn alle haben wir auch
nicht selber), Ambiente-Kram, genug Getränke, Essen u.ä. Dann
können wir gründen und endlich starten.</p>
<p><b>Warum Ihr uns unterstützen solltet</b></p>
<p>Voyager macht Euch ein
Angebot, dass Ihr nicht ablehnen könnt. Unterstützt die Famiiilie! Bei uns gibt’s
auch garantiert keine Betonfüße!</p>
<p>Nein, im Ernst: wenn Ihr
einen ganzjährigen Community-Treffpunkt wollt zum Schnacken, Spielen, Feiern,
Austauschen oder einfach einen Pub mit coolem Angebot und einmaligem Ambiente,
dann helft uns bei der Entstehung!</p>
<p><b>Das passiert mit Eurem Geld</b></p>
<p>Eure Spende fließt direkt
in eine der Anschaffungen oder Renovierungsmaßnahmen. Ihr bekommt dafür einen
der sog. Perks, also eine Gegenleistung von uns – sei es einen Gutschein, ein
Tshirt, eine Heldenplakette auf der Einrichtung oder auch Euer persönlicher
Feiertag. Das gilt allerdings nur, wenn wir den Betrag, den wir brauchen, mit
Eurer Hilfe zusammenkriegen. Wenn nicht, bekommt jeder Spender automatisch von
Indiegogo sein Geld zurückgebucht, das Voyager sinkt auf den Grund des Meeres
und wir weinen uns jede Nacht in den Schlaf.</p>
<p>Falls wir überfunded
werden, schadet das auch nicht. Perks sind genug da. Es wird dann nur noch
schneller, noch ambientiger in unserer Location. Und wir können noch schneller
noch mehr tolle Spiele auf einmal beschaffen. </p>
<p>Wir wissen, dass die
Startsumme hoch ist. Doch wir wissen auch, dass ihr Eure Unterstützung nicht
bereuen werdet. Go Voyager!!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Und so geht’s </b></p>
<p>Eine Anmeldung bei Indiegogo ist gar nicht erforderlich. <span><span><span><span>Ihr sucht Euch einfach den schönsten Perk auf unserer Seite hier aus und klickt drauf. Dann müsst Ihr nur <span><span><span><span>Eure email-Adresse angeben, damit Ihr die Bestätigung zugeschickt bekommt und </span></span></span></span>werdet dann gleich zur PayPal- oder Kreditkartenzahlung weitergeleitet (Vorsicht, PayPal ist ein wenig aufdringlich.. auf dem Button steht ""weiter zu PayPal"", aber zur Kreditkartenzahlung</span></span></span></span> kommt man auch da lang). Zahlung abschicken und fertig :-)<br/></p>
<p>(Bei der Anmeldung zu Indiegogo müsste man allerdings auch nur Name und email-Adresse eintragen mit Passwort, ist also nicht viel aufwendiger.)<br/></p>
<p><b>Wie kann man sonst noch helfen?</b></p>
<p>Gehet hin und verbreitet
die Kunde vom künftigen Ort der Heiterkeit! Erzählt über uns, empfehlt uns
weiter, rührt ein bisschen die Werbetrommel. Je mehr Menschen von unserem
Projekt erfahren, desto mehr Unterstützer können wir gewinnen. Es ist auch
nicht wichtig, ob diese Leute in unserer Region wohnen. Jeder von Euch kennt
wen, der wiederum wen kennt… </p>
<p>Anstelle des Fundings
bieten wir zusätzlich die Möglichkeit, bei uns zu investieren. Das geht natürlich
auch! Wir zahlen vernünftigere Zinsen als die Banken derzeit! Wer sich hierfür
interessiert, sollte uns natürlich sofort ansprechen.</p>
<p><i><b>English Summary - Voyager in a nutshell</b></i></p>
<p><i>We're about to open a Fantasy Pub/ (Board)Game Café in Bonn, Germany and we're going to name it ""Voyager"" (subtitle: travel to distant worlds and ages). That's because we want to include every fantasy and sci-fi genre as well as historical and literary topics, e.g. in our theme parties, our celebrated holidays (Star Wars-Day, Pi(e)-Day, Talk like a Pirate-Day, etc.), workshops and of course in our beverages and food. In addition to the usual stuff we plan to offer uncommon beer.. uncommon at least for this part of Germany.. that would be for instance beer from Belgium, Scotland, Southern Germany and beer with weird creatures on the bottles. Various flavours of mead and spiced wine are on the menu, as well as rare lemonades and a lovely English tea time.</i></p>
<p><i>Our pub will be open for every noob and nerd, and they are very welcome to choose from our large and ever growing collection of games (board~, card~, role play~, etc.). We'll also provide space for miniature wargaming.</i></p>
<p><i>The atmosphere at the Voyager is meant to be cosy and a combination of a medieval tavern and your second living room. We plan to furnish the rooms with sofas, wooden benches, seats and tables. In every corner you will find another geeky reference.</i></p>
<p><i>Why are we crowdfunding? Well, we lack the money to furnish and repaint the location which is about half of the amount we need to get going (there is a list of the things we need among the updates.. in German though).</i></p>
<p><i>We would be very happy if you donated a couple of Euros so we can make the world an even better geeky place! The perks vary from a personal postcard from us, free drinks and food, T-shirts, an entry on Voyager's official hero charter, a fantasy cooking class, or your personal annual holiday which we will name after you (or your IC-name) and celebrate at the pub. Apart from the donations you can also become an investor. We pay better interests than the bank with certainty. If you wish to invest feel free to contact us and ask for more details from our business plan!</i></p>

Die Tatsache
In Bonn fehlt was! Und
auch in der Umgebung! Ein Ort für Fantasy-Freunde und Spiele-Fans – eine
Anlaufstelle für alte Hasen und frische Neugierige, an der man auch noch in
passendem Ambiente bewirtet wird. 
Die Vision
Wir wollen das ändern und
im schönen Bonn ein Spiele-Café und Fantasy-Pub eröffnen, als besonderen
Treffpunkt mit Atmosphäre und Gemütlichkeit. Dort werden alle möglichen Sorten
von Spielen vertreten sein:
Gesellschaftsspiele, Rollenspiele, Platz für Table Tops, Spiele-Turniere und
auch Demo-Runden. Dazu stellen wir uns ein ausgiebiges Veranstaltungsprogramm vor mit Themenpartys zu aktuellen und
klassischen Fantasy- und Science Fiction-Genres, hin und wieder auch was Historisches
und Literarisches, Lesungen, Workshops, Bierproben, Konzerte etc.
Ihr könnt dann auch gerne
selber etwas anbieten!
Damit zudem die
Geschmackssinne etwas zu tun bekommen, bieten wir ein spannendes Getränke-Angebot: Biere aus dem Ausland
oder weiter entfernten, deutschen Regionen. Kennt Ihr z.B. Lambic oder
Trappistenbier? Dubbel- oder Tripelbier? Wisst ihr, was für tolle Sachen im
Fränkischen gebraut werden? Außerdem gibt es verschiedene Metsorten, historische
Gewürzweine, seltene Limonaden usw. Dazu haben wir kleine Speisen, von Muffins bis Pommes und Burger. Die idealen Snacks zum
Spielen.
Selbstredend können wir uns
ebenfalls gut vorstellen, mit verschiedenen Einrichtungen im Bereich der
gemeinnützigen Tätigkeit zusammenzuarbeiten. Wir sind
immer offen für Gespräche.
Wer sind wir?
Astrid. Arbeitet mit bei
Crimson Darkness, der Hörnchen-Manufaktur und turnt mit denen seit acht Jahren
über die Cons, Messen, Märkte und Festivals. Sie ist an und für sich
Archäologin, Mediävistin und passionierter Fantasy-Fan. Im Voyager wird sie zur
Herrin der Küche und der Lagerauffüllung. Ihr kennt wahrscheinlich schon ihre
Kekse – sie kann auch noch mehr!
Kay. Ist auch schon seit
Jahren bei Crimson Darkness. Er kann Diplom-Bibliothekar und hat viel im
kaufmännischen gearbeitet. Seine Liebe gilt alter Fantasy und Science Fiction,
egal ob Buch oder Film. Ihm wird die Theke zu Untertan sein. 
Beide Chefs zusammen
werden sich um sämtliche Organisation und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit kümmern. Auch
wenn wir nicht immer einwandfrei rechts und links unterscheiden können, wissen
wir dennoch, was die rechte und die linke Hand des Anderen tut!
Unser Team wird außerdem unterstützt
durch das Meister-Hörnchen Atma Sinnan selber. Sie wird uns in allen praktischen
Design- und Ausstattungsfragen behilflich sein. Hörnchens Bruder Max wird uns
vor Ort gekonnt durch die Untiefen der Buchhaltung führen, und Kay sein Bruder
Maik erhält die handwerkliche Supervision auf dem Voyager-Boot.
Wer darf zu uns kommen?
Das ist mal
eine Frage! Na, Ihr alle!!! Jung und alt, dick und dünn, Männlein, Weiblein,
Ork und Elf, Pirat und Klingone... Menschen? Ja, die dürfen auch rein! Wir
öffnen die Pforten für jede Art von Noob und Nerd! Wissen, was ein Würfel ist,
kann auch nicht schaden. Nur wer ein Casino sucht, ist bei uns leider falsch.
Ihr dürft so viel spielen, wie Ihr wollt.. Ihr müsst aber nicht!

Was wir schon haben
Wir haben mit ein wenig
professioneller Hilfe einen langen (sehr langen) Businessplan geschrieben. Wir
haben uns das künftige Veranstaltungsprogramm ausgedacht und geplant, jede
Menge Dekorationsideen und sowohl Speise- als auch Getränkeauswahl für Euch
fertig entwickelt. 
Von uns gestartete
Umfragen haben viel positives Feedback und weitere Anregungen ergeben, die wir
zu einem gar nicht mal so kleinen Teil bereits eingeplant oder umgesetzt haben.
Und tatsächlich: Wir
hätten sogar schon einen Laden in Aussicht, der genau unseren räumlichen
Erfordernissen und Vorstellungen entspräche! Eigentlich könnten wir uns den
schnappen und loslegen… aber…
Was wir noch brauchen
Da wir schon so fleißig
waren, brauchen wir nur noch das, was im Grunde alle brauchen: Geld. 
Es gibt reichlich Dinge,
die finanzieren werden möchten: Die Location will ein bisschen renoviert und umdekoriert
werden. Bei Küche und Theke müssen wir noch mal bei. Dazu fehlen noch einige Möbel, viele Spiele (denn alle haben wir auch
nicht selber), Ambiente-Kram, genug Getränke, Essen u.ä. Dann
können wir gründen und endlich starten.
Warum Ihr uns unterstützen solltet
Voyager macht Euch ein
Angebot, dass Ihr nicht ablehnen könnt. Unterstützt die Famiiilie! Bei uns gibt’s
auch garantiert keine Betonfüße!
Nein, im Ernst: wenn Ihr
einen ganzjährigen Community-Treffpunkt wollt zum Schnacken, Spielen, Feiern,
Austauschen oder einfach einen Pub mit coolem Angebot und einmaligem Ambiente,
dann helft uns bei der Entstehung!
Das passiert mit Eurem Geld
Eure Spende fließt direkt
in eine der Anschaffungen oder Renovierungsmaßnahmen. Ihr bekommt dafür einen
der sog. Perks, also eine Gegenleistung von uns – sei es einen Gutschein, ein
Tshirt, eine Heldenplakette auf der Einrichtung oder auch Euer persönlicher
Feiertag. Das gilt allerdings nur, wenn wir den Betrag, den wir brauchen, mit
Eurer Hilfe zusammenkriegen. Wenn nicht, bekommt jeder Spender automatisch von
Indiegogo sein Geld zurückgebucht, das Voyager sinkt auf den Grund des Meeres
und wir weinen uns jede Nacht in den Schlaf.
Falls wir überfunded
werden, schadet das auch nicht. Perks sind genug da. Es wird dann nur noch
schneller, noch ambientiger in unserer Location. Und wir können noch schneller
noch mehr tolle Spiele auf einmal beschaffen. 
Wir wissen, dass die
Startsumme hoch ist. Doch wir wissen auch, dass ihr Eure Unterstützung nicht
bereuen werdet. Go Voyager!!

Und so geht’s 
Eine Anmeldung bei Indiegogo ist gar nicht erforderlich. Ihr sucht Euch einfach den schönsten Perk auf unserer Seite hier aus und klickt drauf. Dann müsst Ihr nur Eure email-Adresse angeben, damit Ihr die Bestätigung zugeschickt bekommt und werdet dann gleich zur PayPal- oder Kreditkartenzahlung weitergeleitet (Vorsicht, PayPal ist ein wenig aufdringlich.. auf dem Button steht ""weiter zu PayPal"", aber zur Kreditkartenzahlung kommt man auch da lang). Zahlung abschicken und fertig :-)
(Bei der Anmeldung zu Indiegogo müsste man allerdings auch nur Name und email-Adresse eintragen mit Passwort, ist also nicht viel aufwendiger.)
Wie kann man sonst noch helfen?
Gehet hin und verbreitet
die Kunde vom künftigen Ort der Heiterkeit! Erzählt über uns, empfehlt uns
weiter, rührt ein bisschen die Werbetrommel. Je mehr Menschen von unserem
Projekt erfahren, desto mehr Unterstützer können wir gewinnen. Es ist auch
nicht wichtig, ob diese Leute in unserer Region wohnen. Jeder von Euch kennt
wen, der wiederum wen kennt… 
Anstelle des Fundings
bieten wir zusätzlich die Möglichkeit, bei uns zu investieren. Das geht natürlich
auch! Wir zahlen vernünftigere Zinsen als die Banken derzeit! Wer sich hierfür
interessiert, sollte uns natürlich sofort ansprechen.
English Summary - Voyager in a nutshell
We're about to open a Fantasy Pub/ (Board)Game Café in Bonn, Germany and we're going to name it ""Voyager"" (subtitle: travel to distant worlds and ages). That's because we want to include every fantasy and sci-fi genre as well as historical and literary topics, e.g. in our theme parties, our celebrated holidays (Star Wars-Day, Pi(e)-Day, Talk like a Pirate-Day, etc.), workshops and of course in our beverages and food. In addition to the usual stuff we plan to offer uncommon beer.. uncommon at least for this part of Germany.. that would be for instance beer from Belgium, Scotland, Southern Germany and beer with weird creatures on the bottles. Various flavours of mead and spiced wine are on the menu, as well as rare lemonades and a lovely English tea time.
Our pub will be open for every noob and nerd, and they are very welcome to choose from our large and ever growing collection of games (board~, card~, role play~, etc.). We'll also provide space for miniature wargaming.
The atmosphere at the Voyager is meant to be cosy and a combination of a medieval tavern and your second living room. We plan to furnish the rooms with sofas, wooden benches, seats and tables. In every corner you will find another geeky reference.
Why are we crowdfunding? Well, we lack the money to furnish and repaint the location which is about half of the amount we need to get going (there is a list of the things we need among the updates.. in German though).
We would be very happy if you donated a couple of Euros so we can make the world an even better geeky place! The perks vary from a personal postcard from us, free drinks and food, T-shirts, an entry on Voyager's official hero charter, a fantasy cooking class, or your personal annual holiday which we will name after you (or your IC-name) and celebrate at the pub. Apart from the donations you can also become an investor. We pay better interests than the bank with certainty. If you wish to invest feel free to contact us and ask for more details from our business plan!

<p>As you progress through the game, you'll find more about the sect of cultists that was operating down the crypts. Or does it still? It's up to you to explore the dark places and learn their forgotten secrets. Read the books and parchments left behind as you delve deeper and deeper down the crypts.</p>
<p>Reading the scripts is not required to complete the maps, but you may miss secret areas and puzzle hints. Maps will be filled witch secret rooms and corridors for you to explore but first you need to find them. How? You can find tips in the writings lying around or you may go deeper into the darkness and watch for hidden switches and other clues.</p>

<h4>
<br/>AMBIENT</h4>We are working really hard to create the best ambient that we can.

<p>Each level will have secrets and relics just begging to be found, but most of the time that won't be an easy job.

You can also use gold coins at the friendly spirits found around the secret places which will unlock extra maps. <br/><br/>There is this Ferryman on the Swamp of Sprits, for example, which will take you to the other side (unlocking the map) but the ride won't be for free.  <br/><br/>Unlocking extra maps won't be mandatory to finish the game though.

We put a lot of thought into how the Courier of the Crypts should sound. Like visuals the sound has 

changed over the years of development. Originally we had music playing throughout the game but 

we realized that it didn`t work as we hoped it would. We scratched that idea and started working on 

a new concept. We came up with the idea of not having music at all but rather have some short 

musical segments or stingers that let the player know on what is happening sound wise. Therefore 

you will hear a distinct music piece when boss battle starts or when you find a particular secret. </div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">The whole game will be driven by soundscapes as we feel it is the best representation of what the 

crypts would sound. These soundscapes will be dynamic, meaning they will change according to what 

the player torch status is. For instance, when you are running low on torch light the soundscape will 

change to become creepier. The player will definitely know that something is going on – that 

something is not right. </div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>On the other hand there will be a Courier of the Crypts soundtrack which will feature complete <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">scores of the short pieces that you will hear in game plus there will be some bonus theme songs </span><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">included in the final rendition of the game.</span></p>

<br/><p><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">First concept and idea for the game was born in April 2011, on the Ludum Dare #20 competition (</span><a href=""http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&amp;uid=3804"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;""></a><a href=""http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&amp;uid=3804"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank""><i>see the entry here</i></a><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">). The theme was ""</span><i style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">You won't be going alone, take this!</i><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">"". In 48 hours I created this quick and rough prototype of a Courier weilding this magic torch that scares the spiders off. After the competition I left the idea alone until October that year. It was an October challenge - make/finish something and earn at least 1$. I created a whole new visual style of the game and added more of the gameplay like throwing flame urns, switches, gold and more. At that point I knew I can do much more from this and my journey began. Through many prototypes and different visual styles I've reached the final form which I'm working on in the last year.</span><br/></p>

STORYEnter the story of a young and mischievous fella' on his first work day at the Pony Delivery Service. This is the Courier.
His first errand is simple, take a letter to the guardian of the crypts. But like in every story, something must go wrong. The Courier is determined to finish his delivery despite all the dangers lurking down in the crypts but it may be a much longer journey than he ever imagined.

Lead the Courier through the ominous crypts full of mysteries and forgotten secrets. Regardless of the dangers you'll face you have to make sure the letter is delivered. Don't be afraid though, for you won't be going alone...


Your best friend is a magic torch which will guard you from the forsaken souls and illuminate the darkest pathsbefore you. Be aware though for the torch needs to feed otherwise its flame will vanish and you may get lost forever.



TORCH MECHANICS



The main aspect of the game is a magic torch that you wield. Environment will react to it's flames in different ways so it will be common for you to toggle the flame on and off throughout the game. Some enemies will leave you alone while others will try to extinguish the torch. It's up to you to learn all about them and use that knowledge to your advantage. Some enemies you can lure into traps, or sneak past them. And will you let the Dark Moths drink your light or let them attack you? There are also riddles in the dark that only magic flame reveals. Enemies and puzzles should not be your main worry though. You must keep your torch filled with magic flame at all times or fall prey to the dark spirits. Use your torch wisely and look after its flame.



EXPLORATION & BACKSTORY


As you progress through the game, you'll find more about the sect of cultists that was operating down the crypts. Or does it still? It's up to you to explore the dark places and learn their forgotten secrets. Read the books and parchments left behind as you delve deeper and deeper down the crypts.
Reading the scripts is not required to complete the maps, but you may miss secret areas and puzzle hints. Maps will be filled witch secret rooms and corridors for you to explore but first you need to find them. How? You can find tips in the writings lying around or you may go deeper into the darkness and watch for hidden switches and other clues.


AMBIENTWe are working really hard to create the best ambient that we can. We want players to enjoy just being there in the game and feel the crypts around them. Lights, sounds, music and events are repeatedly pieced together until everything feels perfect. 



ENVIRONMENTSThe world is seperated into three episodes. Each episode will take the Courier deeper down the crypts and unlock new gameplay elements, enemies and puzzles. Each episode will also feature a unique theme with one extra sub-theme. The fact that the game is happening down the crypts shouldn't confuse you, the underground hides much more than some graves and dusty scrolls.



REPLAY VALUE

Each level will have secrets and relics just begging to be found, but most of the time that won't be an easy job. This offers an extra challenge and you may soon find yourself searching for perfection points in each map. Some maps will also have alternative endings, unlocking secret maps for you to enjoy. Your efforts put in exploration will be rewarded.
Secret places also offer rich treasures which can be used for...

UPGRADES & MAP UNLOCKS
Somewhere in the game you'll be able to use your money to buy some small upgrades from ghosts like increased number of hearts or slower flame consumption. You can also use gold coins at the friendly spirits found around the secret places which will unlock extra maps. There is this Ferryman on the Swamp of Sprits, for example, which will take you to the other side (unlocking the map) but the ride won't be for free.  Unlocking extra maps won't be mandatory to finish the game though. For true explorers and perfectionists there's a lot to do in the game so make sure you grab all the shinnies you can find on your way.



We put a lot of thought into how the Courier of the Crypts should sound. Like visuals the sound has 

changed over the years of development. Originally we had music playing throughout the game but 

we realized that it didn`t work as we hoped it would. We scratched that idea and started working on 

a new concept. We came up with the idea of not having music at all but rather have some short 

musical segments or stingers that let the player know on what is happening sound wise. Therefore 

you will hear a distinct music piece when boss battle starts or when you find a particular secret. The whole game will be driven by soundscapes as we feel it is the best representation of what the 

crypts would sound. These soundscapes will be dynamic, meaning they will change according to what 

the player torch status is. For instance, when you are running low on torch light the soundscape will 

change to become creepier. The player will definitely know that something is going on – that 

something is not right. 
On the other hand there will be a Courier of the Crypts soundtrack which will feature complete scores of the short pieces that you will hear in game plus there will be some bonus theme songs included in the final rendition of the game.
MUSIC EXAMPLES














         
First concept and idea for the game was born in April 2011, on the Ludum Dare #20 competition (see the entry here). The theme was ""You won't be going alone, take this!"". In 48 hours I created this quick and rough prototype of a Courier weilding this magic torch that scares the spiders off. After the competition I left the idea alone until October that year. It was an October challenge - make/finish something and earn at least 1$. I created a whole new visual style of the game and added more of the gameplay like throwing flame urns, switches, gold and more. At that point I knew I can do much more from this and my journey began. Through many prototypes and different visual styles I've reached the final form which I'm working on in the last year.


PROJECT'S EVOLUTION








         



You will get a DRM-free digital version of the game as well as Steam / GOG key. The game has been greenlit so the keys will be supplied when available.
The same rules apply for extra copy perk.



You'll get an access to the private forums which will be created after the campaign. I'll be posting private testing builds there for preview, testing and discussion. 


The soundtrack which will feature complete scores basedon short pieces you will hear in the game.In addition, there will be bonus theme songs included in the final rendition of the game. Look under the music section for the examplesDigital format only

Add Courier of the Crypts to your games collection shelf and get a full CD box with a game and printed manual. (You still get the digital copy of the game)



Almost 4 years of the development is a lot, especially when it comes to one person behind the game. After the game release I want to gather all the notes and memories to write a full book about the development. It will include good and bad personal moments that I faced during that time - from times that I almost quit to smiles when I saw first article published about the game. Book will also contain scrap notes (early game designs, level designs, skecthes...) as well as images from different development stages. Every printed book will be signed with thank you note added.
(PDF or softcover printed format)


Graveyard of supporters will be a standalone map with graves and statues of pledgers who selected limited graveyard special reward. You'll be able to chose one of the premade tombstones / statues and put your name or nickname on it.To make it even more interesting, this map will feature a secret to be found for every player. Your grave may get some visitors after all ;)

This is a quick preview of different options, but there will be much more to chose from.




You'll create a bonus map with our guidence for all the players to play. You'll have free hands to create whatever you want with the assets already in the game.

         Through all these years I was working on the game in all the spare time I could find , next to the full time work and studies. I've brough the project really far and it seems there are a lot of people who would like to see this game out and released. To finish the game as I wanted it to be I need your help.

HOW WILL THE MONEY BE USED



Food & Coffee - even though I'm working from home, I still need to pay for food and coffee that will keep me going.


Company expenses - If the campaign succeeds I'll have to register as a so-called independent entrepreneur to satisfy the taxation and bureaucratic requirements. This adds extra monthly expenses.

Sound & Music - Even though I'm working on everything by myself I still can't produce any sounds or music.  Great music and sounds for the game with ambient like this one does not come for free. 

Stretch goals - money that will pass the initial target will go towards the stretch goals. This means paying for extra help (freelancers) where needed.


WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T REACH THE GOAL
I'll most likely need a new job or at least start heavy freelancing. That will slow down the development enormously or even stop it for a while.



  Risks & Challenges As we all know, there are things in life that come to us unexpectedly but for what's in my power, I'll do my very best to follow the plan and release the game in late 2015 (November?). Game development is full of challenges and sometimes a task takes much longer than you planned. In worst case scenario, the release date will be postponed by a few months.

<p>Hi, my name is Jess and I’m 13 years old. For the past 8 years I’ve lived on the beautiful island of Tasmania. I live a wonderful life, visiting amazing places, taking photographs and creating art. I want to go to Uluru in the very heart of the Australian outback and create a portfolio of photographs of my adventure. The centre of Australia is a long way from home, so I’m inviting you to come along on this adventure with me by helping me to get there and back again.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The trouble is Australia is a big place. The two week trip is more than 5000 km (3000 miles) long and that’s not including an eleven hour boat trip across Bass Strait to get to the mainland from Tasmania.  My Dad has promised to drive me there if I can raise enough money to cover the costs. We will be driving through the southern states of Victoria and South Australia and then north, all the way to the Northern Territory.</p>

<p>I'm glad you asked, because we happen to think games and economics are a perfect match for each other. After all, why exactly is it that we find all that scheming, plotting, forging and breaking of allegiances so addictive in games? It's because that's what we - human beings - are so good at. We are above all, social animals, and games capture that perfectly. There's a good reason why economists as far back as 1713, trying to understand human strategic behaviour, called it 'game theory'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the rules? Where can I find out exactly how Economicon works?</strong></p>
<p>Have a look at the tabletop verion. You can download it from <a href=""http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/education/games/economicon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this link</a>. The online version will be identical, but, well, online.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are we doing to help schools and teachers use it too? </strong></p>
<p>We're working with teachers and education specialists to develop a base of resources that will include suggested lesson plans and guidelines on how to fit Economicon into the syllabus for different subjects.</p>
<p>Once we've got it working in schools though, we think it also has much wider applications. Economicon deals with some fairly deep principles of gameplay, economics and social psychology, so anyone who likes games and is interested in how people and societies work should love it. And, because it will be online and completely free to access, it will be open to anybody.</p>
<p>Besides being an educational tool, it will also gather data from every game played. So it won't just be the students who are learning more about economics and society, it'll be the rest of us too!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hmm. Gather data, you say. Who exactly will have access to all this data?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone. The data we gather on what decisions people tend to make under which conditions and the patterns of social influence will be freely available online to anyone who wants it - universities, researchers, campaigners or governments. Economicon won't be linked to your online profile. You just enter a name and pick an avatar each time you play, so you (or anyone else) can't go and check up on how selfish your friends or anyone else is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> If I want to try out Economicon in my school/university right now, can I get involved? </strong></p>
<p>Absolutely you can! We're running school trials of the tabletop version right now and developing our teacher resources. And were going to keep testing throughout the build process. If you are interested in getting involved with any part of this project, we'd love to hear from you! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What next?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, creating the game is not the end of the story. This is no ordinary computer game, after all. Making something awesomely fun to play is in some ways just the start of this project. Once we've made it, we need to get it out into the world, being played and gathering lots of useful data that will help us all to better understand the societies we live in. We'll be introducing it to schools, universities and businesses, but we also need you, our backers, to play the game and spread the word!</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Daniele Messina, I'm from Italy. On the Internet I often go by the nickname Charlie Fleed. I'm a Computer Engineer with a passion for RPGs and strategic games. If you are reading this, you probably like them too. Well, then Hartacon Tactics is for you! </p>

<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Hartacon Tactics is a turn-based strategy RPG developed for PC where players challenge each other in online battles, also featuring a single-player campaign. Each player controls a party of fighters chosen from eight different classes and can face all enemies alone or team up in alliances. Battles take place in 2D isometric maps with 4-angles view and zoom.</p>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/855548/files/20140914032942-Hartacon_2014-07-19_20-16-32-cs.png?1410690582"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The battle system is tactical, turn-based, and features traditional RPG aspects such as elements, altered states together with formations bonuses, damage depending on the direction of attack, heights, covers, and all the mechanics work in an almost 100% deterministic way, making battles a dispute of strategically planning minds.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>Each class can equip two weapon categories and accesses two corresponding lines of skills which range from pure magic spells, to creation of barriers, modification of the maps, throwing allies and enemies, and much more. All classes are unique and strategically different.</p>
<div>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">By winning battles, parties gain Upgrade Points (UPs), used to recruit new characters and buy equipments, while individual characters gain Growth Points (GPs), used to learn new skills and increase stats.</span><br/>

<p>Hartacon Tactics comes with a complete in-game map editor, where players will be able to build custom maps for their battles and share them with other players, and the creators of the most popular maps will be awarded with bonus points for their parties.</p>

<p>After more than two years in the making and a huge personal effort, the technical side of Hartacon Tactics is now close to completion and the game needs you.</p>
<p>I am the game designer and programmer of Hartacon Tactics, I am fairly good at drawing comics-style stuff too, but for this project I want to bring you really wonderful visuals, and that is why I am working with skilled professionals in making game assets, who have helped me to create a lively and colorful fantasy world.</p>
<p>But you don't have to take my word for it, you can see it by yourself. Just download the demo from IndieDB, setup a party, build you own custom maps if you want, and start playing!</p>

</div><p>Are you back? Pretty good, uh? That is just a sample of what Hartacon Tactics will be with your support. This is where your contribution will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hartacon Tactics already has one beautifuI outdoor tileset for its maps, but I plan to add more outdoor and indoor <b>tilesets</b>, all rich of great assets.</li>
<li>The GUI is pretty much ready but the game needs <b>icons </b>for every weapon, equipment, skill and whatnot.</li>
<li>As far as battle is concerned there cannot be good action without great character <b>animations, visual effects and sounds</b>.</li>
<li>The single-player campaign needs <b>NPCs and locations art</b>.</li>
<li>The multiplayer modes need a fast and reliable <b>server</b>, I will not charge the players for playing online.</li>
</ul><p>As a reviewer once pointed out, this is a work of passion and love for the SRPG genre. I will get this game done, but your contribution is what will take Hartacon Tactics to another level, allowing me to present you with a true gaming art piece.</p><p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Hi! My name is Daniele Messina, I'm from Italy. On the Internet I often go by the nickname Charlie Fleed. I'm a Computer Engineer with a passion for RPGs and strategic games. If you are reading this, you probably like them too. Well, then Hartacon Tactics is for you! 





Hartacon Tactics is a turn-based strategy RPG developed for PC where players challenge each other in online battles, also featuring a single-player campaign. Each player controls a party of fighters chosen from eight different classes and can face all enemies alone or team up in alliances. Battles take place in 2D isometric maps with 4-angles view and zoom.

The battle system is tactical, turn-based, and features traditional RPG aspects such as elements, altered states together with formations bonuses, damage depending on the direction of attack, heights, covers, and all the mechanics work in an almost 100% deterministic way, making battles a dispute of strategically planning minds.



Each class can equip two weapon categories and accesses two corresponding lines of skills which range from pure magic spells, to creation of barriers, modification of the maps, throwing allies and enemies, and much more. All classes are unique and strategically different.

By winning battles, parties gain Upgrade Points (UPs), used to recruit new characters and buy equipments, while individual characters gain Growth Points (GPs), used to learn new skills and increase stats.


Hartacon Tactics comes with a complete in-game map editor, where players will be able to build custom maps for their battles and share them with other players, and the creators of the most popular maps will be awarded with bonus points for their parties.

Hartacon Tactics is developed with XNA 4 and will be released for PC, and for XBOX 360 in the indie games section of XBOX Live.

After more than two years in the making and a huge personal effort, the technical side of Hartacon Tactics is now close to completion and the game needs you.
I am the game designer and programmer of Hartacon Tactics, I am fairly good at drawing comics-style stuff too, but for this project I want to bring you really wonderful visuals, and that is why I am working with skilled professionals in making game assets, who have helped me to create a lively and colorful fantasy world.
But you don't have to take my word for it, you can see it by yourself. Just download the demo from IndieDB, setup a party, build you own custom maps if you want, and start playing!


Are you back? Pretty good, uh? That is just a sample of what Hartacon Tactics will be with your support. This is where your contribution will go:

Hartacon Tactics already has one beautifuI outdoor tileset for its maps, but I plan to add more outdoor and indoor tilesets, all rich of great assets.
The GUI is pretty much ready but the game needs icons for every weapon, equipment, skill and whatnot.
As far as battle is concerned there cannot be good action without great character animations, visual effects and sounds.
The single-player campaign needs NPCs and locations art.
The multiplayer modes need a fast and reliable server, I will not charge the players for playing online.
As a reviewer once pointed out, this is a work of passion and love for the SRPG genre. I will get this game done, but your contribution is what will take Hartacon Tactics to another level, allowing me to present you with a true gaming art piece.



Pre-order, you will get a digital copy of the game! You didn't expect that...

We’re doing everything in our power to make sure this doesn’t happen to Go Fight Fantastic!</p><p><strong><u>We’ve been living and breathing this game for the last 4+ years, investing all of our time and money into it</u> – and we’ve had friends and family invest their hard earned money into the game. There’s simply no way we’re gonna stop now and disappoint ourselves and everyone who’s invested in the game. No matter what! </strong></p><p>As a small team our biggest challenge is working against the clock. We believe in having honest and transparent communication with our followers and backers, always letting you know what’s going on. Throughout the whole project, we’ve had a clear plan for the scope of the game. Every feature added has been discussed thoroughly in terms of both value to the game and development time/cost. We’ve killed darlings to maintain a realistic scope in order to make sure we can actually deliver on our vision, both from a financial and a technical standpoint.</p><p><i>And lastly, regarding the Covid-19 situation: We take the situation extremely seriously, working from home and keeping interactions to an absolute minimum. That said, being dependent on external manufacturing of rewards/perks as well as for international shipping routes/logistics, there's always the risk of a slight delay when it comes to reward/perk fulfillment. To avoid delays to the best of our abilities, we'll make sure to start manufacturing of rewards/perks and prepare for shipping a few months ahead of time.</i></p><p> </p><h3>Special Thanks!</h3><p><strong>We want to give a huge thank you to our amazing friends and family who have supported us in so many ways since the start of this project.</strong> We simply couldn’t have done it without you. We love you guys!❤️</p><p><strong>We also want to thank Two Feathers (Elvira &amp; Nicklas) for all their hard work on the music for the trailer!</strong> How great is that song, right?</p><p><strong>And special thanks to our amazing interns we’ve had over the years; Jesper, Emmi &amp; Jessica.</strong> Thank you for all your hard work! You’re awesome!</p><p><strong>And finally a special shoutout and thanks to our friends at East Sweden Games in Linköping who have welcomed us with open arms to various expos/conventions/trade shows as well as inviting us to do a talk about the development of the game.</strong> If you’re a game developer, you should definitely look these guys up!</p></div>","Go Fight Fantastic! is a super vibrant 1-3 player Hack 'n Slash game where you and up to two friends play as the Tank, the Striker and the Healer, each with their own set of abilities. The game features both online and local multiplayer and will be released on Steam Early Access in 2022.Work together to fight off an alien invasion, find upgrades to get stronger and customize your characters' abilities along the way! Early Horde Mode Contest at Sweden Game Conference 2019 The game features a rich, colorful aesthetic with hand drawn environments and characters, a multi level story mode as well as a ton of challenges for those looking to really put their skills to the test. Hand drawn art/animation: Mixing 3D with 2D frame-by-frame animations!  Platforms & Closed BetaThe game will release on PC/Steam Early Access in 2022, but we're hoping to bring the game to the Switch, Playstation and Xbox in 2023 (estimated).  As a backer for this projects, you'll get instant unlimited access to the Closed Beta through Steam, meaning you can start playing the latest beta right away! Open Beta Weekends!If you want a chance to try the game out before you buy, you can request access to the limited Open Beta using the 'Request Access'-button on our Steam Page. This will give you a chance to try out the game, but playtime will be limited to specific weekends only!   StoryThe game is about a gang of teen mercenaries and their spacedog-captain who stumble into an alien invasion and must fight against all odds to save the local bird-people from destruction! The alien invaders start kidnapping people from the planet. Our heroes get caught in the middle and have no choice but to help the peaceful bird people inhabiting the planet, or they might just be out of work...  GameplayChoose between three playable characters, where each of them have a unique set of abilities and specific role to play in the party. Combine your skills, work together as a team and fight your way forward, overcoming any and all obstacles!   In Story Mode, you unfold the story of what the alien invaders want and do your best to stop people from getting taken from their homes. You can explore for meteorite shards, upgrades you can use in any game mode to modify your character and their abilities. You’ll face enemies, bosses, challenges, events and maybe even a few puzzles!  The Horde Mode Arena lets your team work on communication skills, timing and go for the high score as an onslaught of enemies try to take you and your team down! The longer you play, the harder it will get.  Completing daily challenges and events will give you access to unlockable content, time limited upgrades and much more. The game also offers a wide variety of bonus challenges that grants access to rare and legendary meteorites (upgrades) for those skilled enough.  Upgrade SystemsExploring for and finding Meteorite Shards allow you to upgrade your characters and their attacks. Meteorites are persistent between games and level up as you play, allowing you to build your own collection of upgrades and customize the characters to your specific play style and needs.         Want to run faster, do more damage, electrocute enemies on critical hits or perhapsturn that defensive ability into an offensive one? Meteorite upgrades are the way to go! CharactersThe game features five main characters living on the ship: Super Nova, Dark Matter, Max Sparkles, Mercury and Captain Bowie. Three of which are playable characters with the rest to be added after launch.   Super Nova (the Tank) is a powerful close range character who really knows how to take a beating. She’s the first line of defense for the rest of the team and usually the first to engage enemies.   Dark Matter (the Striker) on the other hand is what’s referred to as a “glass canon”. He’s an incredibly mobile and powerful damage dealer who will easily lay waste to anything in seconds - but if he doesn’t keep moving, a few well placed hits is all it takes to knock him down.     The ever happy go lucky Max Sparkles (the Healer) is rarely seen without his guardian spirit, Aumakua, at his side. Together they do their best to make sure their friends are always safe and sound by using spirit magic.   The Bad Guys: General Poi and her pet monster Froggy! At the end of each level you’ll face off against powerful generals and their various pets in the form of intense boss fights. We've designed our enemies to force you to do more than just hack and slash your way forward. You'll need to read situations, learn enemy behaviors and timing - and know when to strike and when to run! Online & Local Multiplayer The game features both local and online multiplayer but can also be played as a single player game where you can quick-switch between all three characters on the fly! Challenges  Adding unique in-game challenges to your gameplay changes the rules of the game, adding replay value as well as unlocking super rare meteorite upgrades. Challenges can be anything from a shared health pool between the three characters to enemies resurrecting after 10 seconds forcing you to rush through the levels. We’ll add as many as we (and you, our community) can come up with!   Music & Sound Design We’re fortunate to have our friends at Two Feathers working on music and sound design for the game! Two Feathers have previously worked on music and sound design for titles such as Angry Birds 2, Warhammer: Vermintide 2, Aragami, Apex Construct, Hammerwatch and many more. Given what they created for the trailer, we're super exicited to hear what they come up with next!Check out their website here: https://www.twofeathersstudio.com/   Release PlansThe game has been in development for just over 4 years and we’re pushing hard to have the game available on Steam Early Access in 2022. At that point we want the game to be mostly feature complete with the remaining work being focused on adding more levels, characters, upgrades and challenges - and improving features and gameplay further.  So how far along is the game?Everything you see in the trailer is actual gameplay footage from the latest build of the game, so the game is currently very much playable and has already been shown at expos in different stages for the last year or so.

We'll embed a development/release timeline straight into the game making sure you know what’s coming and when!  The Team  We are Lina (art) and Johan (code), a nerdy couple from Sweden who are super passionate about games, creativity and tech. The Team: Lina (Art/Animation), Johan (Tech/Code) & Bowie (Captainy stuff)Together we run a two person production company/studio which allow us to realize our wildest creative dreams. ​We have been fortunate enough to be able to work together for the last 9 years, recently with the addition of our puppy/morale booster Bowie (who’s in the game as Captain Bowie).   We need your help! Before we started working on this project, we both worked full time producing visual content for advertising agencies, retail stores and more. After ending up in perpetual crunch mode working 12-16 hour days, we decided to quit our day jobs and start focusing full time on our dreams and the things we’re most passionate about: game development!  We pooled all of our money and set out to follow our dreams - fully committed to optimizing our day to day costs and spend all of our savings on this massive undertaking. Going on just over 4 years now, we’ve been working and will continue to work without any income until the project is complete, which is why we need your help!            Our Home Office where we make the game!With the resources we have left, crowd funding is a chance for us to keep funding the development of the project without having to go bankrupt in the process.

We’re doing everything in our power to make sure this doesn’t happen to Go Fight Fantastic!We’ve been living and breathing this game for the last 4+ years, investing all of our time and money into it – and we’ve had friends and family invest their hard earned money into the game. There’s simply no way we’re gonna stop now and disappoint ourselves and everyone who’s invested in the game. No matter what! As a small team our biggest challenge is working against the clock. We believe in having honest and transparent communication with our followers and backers, always letting you know what’s going on. Throughout the whole project, we’ve had a clear plan for the scope of the game. Every feature added has been discussed thoroughly in terms of both value to the game and development time/cost. We’ve killed darlings to maintain a realistic scope in order to make sure we can actually deliver on our vision, both from a financial and a technical standpoint.And lastly, regarding the Covid-19 situation: We take the situation extremely seriously, working from home and keeping interactions to an absolute minimum. That said, being dependent on external manufacturing of rewards/perks as well as for international shipping routes/logistics, there's always the risk of a slight delay when it comes to reward/perk fulfillment. To avoid delays to the best of our abilities, we'll make sure to start manufacturing of rewards/perks and prepare for shipping a few months ahead of time. Special Thanks!We want to give a huge thank you to our amazing friends and family who have supported us in so many ways since the start of this project. We simply couldn’t have done it without you. We love you guys!❤️We also want to thank Two Feathers (Elvira & Nicklas) for all their hard work on the music for the trailer! How great is that song, right?And special thanks to our amazing interns we’ve had over the years; Jesper, Emmi & Jessica. Thank you for all your hard work! You’re awesome!And finally a special shoutout and thanks to our friends at East Sweden Games in Linköping who have welcomed us with open arms to various expos/conventions/trade shows as well as inviting us to do a talk about the development of the game. If you’re a game developer, you should definitely look these guys up!",34.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>David Schwimmer's Haunted House</b> is an ambitious indie title, which will offer players an experience never before seen in the gaming industry.

<h2>Human</h2>
<p>  Human has
come a long way since the Shattering. Eons ago, human used to be the most
prestigious of all races. They were the pioneer, the brave and the conqueror,
united by a single emperor. Although they survived the Shattering, their empire
did not. Over the centuries, they crumbled, facing rebellion and dangers from
all sides. Human today is a shadow of their former self.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437578145/vp9olcfxro0x5ikl2wzb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Asura</h2>
<p>    One of the
most powerful combinations of spell and technology employed by the human of
ancient Imperium is the summoning portal. This advancement allows them to call
forth beings from the underworld that they label ‘demons’ for their fiery red
skin and protruding horns.  Towards the
end of the old empire, powerful mages have tried to enslave this magically
powerful race, with little success.  </p>
<p>    The Asura’s homeland is small compared to
those of other races and is at a very close proximity to the Shattered
Continent, the epicenter of the Shattering. Because of this, the Asuran is at
the frontline against the Corrupted horde from the lost continent of Lemuria.
Despite their fearsome appearance, the Asuran shared a relatively amicable
relationship with other races as they maintained a network of Rune Gate that
world together.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437578198/cmmehgz5oifaiuvdek5w.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Rakanian</h2>
<p>   The grip of
humanity reaches the north and the south, but it never managed to rule the
west. The mist and the great jungle of this western continent and isles serve
as a natural barrier that barred off human’s conquest over the course of
centuries. For many years, the beastly people live in a reclusive society, away
from that effect of the Shattering until the first ship arrived. By then, they
encountered not only a powerful kingdom, but two great kingdoms of the
Half-Beast that are in rivalry for dominance. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437676085/xzhqoesewyv7d4wkwbnr.png"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><br/>
<h2>Machina</h2>
<p>   At the
first glance, Machina may seem like mindless machine with one single purpose in
their mind, eradication of human. This isn’t entirely true however. Although
their hatred for human is justified, they shared a relatively amicable relation
with Kon’kraes, whom they owed an eternal gratitude of being saved and
maintained by them after their revolt against human masters.</p>
<p>   Unlike the
other races, these Machina are led by no sole ruler. Instead of a king or an

and go to adventure with many routes of personal story and numerous side quests. 
Player can freely explore the world and dungeons. Find the materials to crafting 
powerful items. Upgrade your character during your journey.
       Imposito is The
land where magic and great technology live side-by-side.     Home
to the countless conflicts among the five great races.        Experience the world of ImpositO as a member of the human race and forge an alliance with the dwarfish Kon’Krae, the demonic Asura, the robotic Machina and the beastkin of Rakania to fight back against the forgotten vicious king. Form friendship as you trek across the continent to recruit friends and allies while bring an end to the bitter conflicts among the five great races.

Human
  Human has
come a long way since the Shattering. Eons ago, human used to be the most
prestigious of all races. They were the pioneer, the brave and the conqueror,
united by a single emperor. Although they survived the Shattering, their empire
did not. Over the centuries, they crumbled, facing rebellion and dangers from
all sides. Human today is a shadow of their former self.  

Asura
    One of the
most powerful combinations of spell and technology employed by the human of
ancient Imperium is the summoning portal. This advancement allows them to call
forth beings from the underworld that they label ‘demons’ for their fiery red
skin and protruding horns.  Towards the
end of the old empire, powerful mages have tried to enslave this magically
powerful race, with little success.  
    The Asura’s homeland is small compared to
those of other races and is at a very close proximity to the Shattered
Continent, the epicenter of the Shattering. Because of this, the Asuran is at
the frontline against the Corrupted horde from the lost continent of Lemuria.
Despite their fearsome appearance, the Asuran shared a relatively amicable
relationship with other races as they maintained a network of Rune Gate that
world together.

Rakanian
   The grip of
humanity reaches the north and the south, but it never managed to rule the
west. The mist and the great jungle of this western continent and isles serve
as a natural barrier that barred off human’s conquest over the course of
centuries. For many years, the beastly people live in a reclusive society, away
from that effect of the Shattering until the first ship arrived. By then, they
encountered not only a powerful kingdom, but two great kingdoms of the
Half-Beast that are in rivalry for dominance. 

Machina
   At the
first glance, Machina may seem like mindless machine with one single purpose in
their mind, eradication of human. This isn’t entirely true however. Although
their hatred for human is justified, they shared a relatively amicable relation
with Kon’kraes, whom they owed an eternal gratitude of being saved and
maintained by them after their revolt against human masters.
   Unlike the
other races, these Machina are led by no sole ruler. Instead of a king or an
emperor, they are under the single but unified directive of the Primarch (or
PRIME-ARK), the collective consciousness of all Machina.

Kon’krae
Kon’krae has divided into many clans. The most prominent of them all are the
Armistat and the Banking clan. The former engaged in arms trade with everyone
far and wide while the latter conducted continent-wide banking enterprise.
Together in a friendly rivalry, these two clans displayed Kon’krae’s prominence

<p>Functional Play is very important to the world and not just the gaming industry.  Diabetes, heart disease, and other ailments are all on the rise. Obesity is at epidemic rates in America and fitness as a whole seems to be less of a priority for most people.  At the same time, more and more children, youth, and adults are turning to video games for recreation. We believe that by combining a unique fitness experience with gaming, we can help people enjoy their training routine to help make fitness a part of everyday life.</p>
<p><img alt=""BluePrints"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.functional-play.com/Images/IndieGogoImages/KBell-BluePrints_IndieGogo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Choosing the Kettlebell as one of our centerpiece products is something we have taken great pride in. We want to assist the public towards the effective use of kettlebells, and unlock this dynamic training tool that builds muscle, helps balance your core strength, melts away fat, helps to train for explosive movement, and is a cardio tool like no other. The list goes on and on... From a young athlete who can't quite get the mechanics of a power clean, to a stay at home parent who wishes to take a challenging cardio class in the middle of the day, our gaming Kettlebell will introduce a safer and easier way to learn these complex exercises. Muscle memory will enable the body to remember these moves and apply them to specific sports skills and activities. </p>
<p>The Functional Play Gaming Kettlebell will allow people to participate in fitness and sport simulations such as cricket, aerobics, wood chops and other fun exercises and workouts. The controls can also be used for other popular games like RPG's, first-person shooters, driving, and many more. Video games will not go away, but we at Functional Play do pledge to combine fitness and gaming to help spread awareness about being healthy while still having fun.</p>

Kettlebell Coach users will be able to perform all kinds of cardio and strength training exercises. Additionally, Kettlebell Coach will allow the user to play swing-action games such as barrel tossing, bocce ball, horseshoe toss and many more.
 




What We Need & What You Get

Details, from proper sensor placing to weight and durability have been carefully examined. However, we do need additional funds to create the software and hardware for the actual game. Those who contribute to the Functional Play campaign will help to provide all users from serious gamers, adults, and young adults with a unique experience that will be fun as well as productive. People who contribute to our campaign will receive great perks from merchandise, camp participation and Bay Area theme trips where the concept of Functional Play was realized.

The Impact
Functional Play is very important to the world and not just the gaming industry.  Diabetes, heart disease, and other ailments are all on the rise. Obesity is at epidemic rates in America and fitness as a whole seems to be less of a priority for most people.  At the same time, more and more children, youth, and adults are turning to video games for recreation. We believe that by combining a unique fitness experience with gaming, we can help people enjoy their training routine to help make fitness a part of everyday life.

Choosing the Kettlebell as one of our centerpiece products is something we have taken great pride in. We want to assist the public towards the effective use of kettlebells, and unlock this dynamic training tool that builds muscle, helps balance your core strength, melts away fat, helps to train for explosive movement, and is a cardio tool like no other. The list goes on and on... From a young athlete who can't quite get the mechanics of a power clean, to a stay at home parent who wishes to take a challenging cardio class in the middle of the day, our gaming Kettlebell will introduce a safer and easier way to learn these complex exercises. Muscle memory will enable the body to remember these moves and apply them to specific sports skills and activities. 
The Functional Play Gaming Kettlebell will allow people to participate in fitness and sport simulations such as cricket, aerobics, wood chops and other fun exercises and workouts. The controls can also be used for other popular games like RPG's, first-person shooters, driving, and many more. Video games will not go away, but we at Functional Play do pledge to combine fitness and gaming to help spread awareness about being healthy while still having fun.



Other Ways You Can Help
We urge you to please contribute to Functional Play’s campaign. Help us realize our dream to make fitness fun for everyone. Our camps would make a great gift for that family member, friend or co-worker who needs a positive jump start and a new challenge. As one of our camp goers please help us to keep everyone safe by getting a doctor's aproval in writing to clear you for the moderate to challenging physical activity. Our camps will be open for people eighteen years or older and of different fitness levels, that is why it is extremly important to be cleared to participate. If you cannot contribute financially, please do help spread the word far and wide so that people who might be able to contribute will have a chance to hear about us and how Functional Play can help. We have experience with talking to game makers and understand the amount of work that goes in to this, but with the proper support you can help this rising company near the edge of the Silicon Valley make an impact around the world.

<p>The
Storyline is very simple and easy to understand. The friends of our
main character “Randy” got kidnapped by a bad snake and its
allegiance. You help Randy rescue his friends by completing missions
and unlock new worlds by fighting against evil bosses. Your journey
starts at the forest and goes through sewerage to find its
(short-term) end at the evil snake’s castle. While
running through the worlds Randy collect cheese – the games
currency – with which you can buy <span>many</span>
new helpful items <span>for
your journey. There is a well balanced shop system with cool
permanent items and upgrades as well as onetime items to help though

</p><p>In unserer Geschichte machte sich im Jahre 1923 eine Expedition auf
nach Afrika, um den Dschungel im Kongo zu erforschen. Die Leitung dieser
Expedition hatte der berühmte deutsche Forscher Walter Sterner und beginnen
sollte ihre Reise in Port Gentil, von wo sie von Einheimischen in die Tiefen
des afrikanischen Dschungels geführt wurden.</p><p>
</p><p>Bereits kurz nach ihrem Start verlor man jeden Kontakt und nur durch
Zufall entdeckte man Jahre später den Leiter der Expedition lebend in einem
selbstgebauten Baumhaus. Doch bis heute sind die Umstände des Verschwindens und
der Verbleib der anderen Expeditionsteilnehmer ungewiss. Nach dem Tod von
Walter Sterner erbte sein Urenkel sein Tagebuch und machte sich mit dessen Hilfe
auf, den Spuren der Expedition zu folgen und das Rätsel der verschollenen
Expedition zu lösen und die Geheimnisse der Stadt der AKIBA zu erforschen.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Zu diesem Abenteuer wollen wir euch gerne mitnehmen, den
Namen von diesem Urenkel könnt Ihr durch einen Perk bestimmen. Der Inhalt des
Tagebuchs wird auf der Internetseite von <a href=""www.akiba-adventure.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Akiba Adventure of Lasergame</a> wöchentlich
preisgegeben.  </p><p></p>
<p></p><h3></h3><p><b>Unsere Idee</b></p><p>
Ihr beginnt euer Abenteuer auf einem Expeditionsschiff
dessen Name kann durch den Erwerb eines Perk gewählt werden. Auf dem Expeditionsschiff
bekommt ihr dann eure Ausrüstung, welche von Lasergame Deutschland stammt. Sie
besteht aus einem Markierer und einem Stirnband. Hier werdet ihr auch in 2
Gruppen aufgeteilt, einmal die Forscher und die Bewahrer. Dann geht es los zu
den Startpunkten, diese befinden sich in gegenüberliegenden Ecken der Arena.
Die Startpunkte sind wie Zelte gestaltet. Dass der Bewahrer im Stil von Beduinen
und das der Forscher wie die englischen Entdeckerzelte Anfang des 19.
Jahrhunderts. Und dann geht es los. Es gilt die meisten Punkte zu sammeln, dies
wird durch markieren von Mitspielern des gegnerischen Teams mit dem Markierer
ermöglicht.</p><p>                                            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/371943/files/20140215093652-markierer_gross.png?1392485812"" src="""" style=""width: 155.486px; height: 124px;""/></p><p>
</p><p>In der Arena wollen wir kleine Gimmicks einbauen, welche ihr
von bekannten Abenteuerfilmen kennt. Auch wollen wir Rätsel welche beim lösen
Extrapunkte bedeuten einbauen. Diese Rätsel sind auch beim Abenteuer-Modus
wichtig, denn nur wenn diese gelöst sind kommt Ihr eine Runde weiter. </p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Richtig gelesen es wird verschiedene Modi geben, den normalen
und den Abenteuer-Modus, welcher Rätsel und eine eindrucksvolle Beleuchtung
bietet. </p><p></p><p>
</p><h3></h3><p><b>Wer sind wir?</b></p><p>
</p><p>Wir sind Andrea und Patrick Leesemann und sind nun seit 9
Jahren ein gut eingespieltes Team und seit 2012 verheiratet. Andrea hat die
kreativen und manchmal verrückten Ideen und Patrick kann sie dann im rechten
Maß umsetzen, so gehen uns niemals die Ideen für neue Abenteuer und
Weiterentwicklungen aus. <br/>
Zusammen haben wir das Konzept von Akiba-Adventure of Lasergame entwickelt und
haben fast täglich neue Ideen, welche wir alsbald umsetzen wollen. Uns werdet ihr auch in der Arena antreffen, denn zusammen managen wir die Halle in
Leverkusen-Opladen.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p>                                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/370266/files/20140214103436-Team-Yaki-Imbiss.jpg?1392402876"" src="""" style=""width: 217px; height: 217px;""/></p><br/><p></p><p>
</p><h3></h3><p><b>Was haben wir schon?</b></p><p>
</p><p>Wir haben eine Halle, in Leverkusen-Opladen, angemietet und
dort sind wir bereits fleißig am renovieren, den größten Kostenposten haben wir
durch einen privaten Investor ermöglichen können. Jedoch brauchen wir nun noch
ein wenig Unterstützung bei den kleinen aber feinen Details und dazu brauchen
wir euch. </p><p>

</p><h2></h2><p><b>Andrea und Patrick</b></p></div>","Hallo und Herzlich Willkommen bei AKIBA-Adventure of Lasergame 
In unserer Geschichte machte sich im Jahre 1923 eine Expedition auf
nach Afrika, um den Dschungel im Kongo zu erforschen. Die Leitung dieser
Expedition hatte der berühmte deutsche Forscher Walter Sterner und beginnen
sollte ihre Reise in Port Gentil, von wo sie von Einheimischen in die Tiefen
des afrikanischen Dschungels geführt wurden.
Bereits kurz nach ihrem Start verlor man jeden Kontakt und nur durch
Zufall entdeckte man Jahre später den Leiter der Expedition lebend in einem
selbstgebauten Baumhaus. Doch bis heute sind die Umstände des Verschwindens und
der Verbleib der anderen Expeditionsteilnehmer ungewiss. Nach dem Tod von
Walter Sterner erbte sein Urenkel sein Tagebuch und machte sich mit dessen Hilfe
auf, den Spuren der Expedition zu folgen und das Rätsel der verschollenen
Expedition zu lösen und die Geheimnisse der Stadt der AKIBA zu erforschen.

Zu diesem Abenteuer wollen wir euch gerne mitnehmen, den
Namen von diesem Urenkel könnt Ihr durch einen Perk bestimmen. Der Inhalt des
Tagebuchs wird auf der Internetseite von Akiba Adventure of Lasergame wöchentlich
preisgegeben.  
Unsere Idee
Ihr beginnt euer Abenteuer auf einem Expeditionsschiff
dessen Name kann durch den Erwerb eines Perk gewählt werden. Auf dem Expeditionsschiff
bekommt ihr dann eure Ausrüstung, welche von Lasergame Deutschland stammt. Sie
besteht aus einem Markierer und einem Stirnband. Hier werdet ihr auch in 2
Gruppen aufgeteilt, einmal die Forscher und die Bewahrer. Dann geht es los zu
den Startpunkten, diese befinden sich in gegenüberliegenden Ecken der Arena.
Die Startpunkte sind wie Zelte gestaltet. Dass der Bewahrer im Stil von Beduinen
und das der Forscher wie die englischen Entdeckerzelte Anfang des 19.
Jahrhunderts. Und dann geht es los. Es gilt die meisten Punkte zu sammeln, dies
wird durch markieren von Mitspielern des gegnerischen Teams mit dem Markierer
ermöglicht.                                            
In der Arena wollen wir kleine Gimmicks einbauen, welche ihr
von bekannten Abenteuerfilmen kennt. Auch wollen wir Rätsel welche beim lösen
Extrapunkte bedeuten einbauen. Diese Rätsel sind auch beim Abenteuer-Modus
wichtig, denn nur wenn diese gelöst sind kommt Ihr eine Runde weiter. 
Richtig gelesen es wird verschiedene Modi geben, den normalen
und den Abenteuer-Modus, welcher Rätsel und eine eindrucksvolle Beleuchtung
bietet. 
Wer sind wir?
Wir sind Andrea und Patrick Leesemann und sind nun seit 9
Jahren ein gut eingespieltes Team und seit 2012 verheiratet. Andrea hat die
kreativen und manchmal verrückten Ideen und Patrick kann sie dann im rechten
Maß umsetzen, so gehen uns niemals die Ideen für neue Abenteuer und
Weiterentwicklungen aus. 
Zusammen haben wir das Konzept von Akiba-Adventure of Lasergame entwickelt und
haben fast täglich neue Ideen, welche wir alsbald umsetzen wollen. Uns werdet ihr auch in der Arena antreffen, denn zusammen managen wir die Halle in
Leverkusen-Opladen.                                      
Was haben wir schon?
Wir haben eine Halle, in Leverkusen-Opladen, angemietet und
dort sind wir bereits fleißig am renovieren, den größten Kostenposten haben wir
durch einen privaten Investor ermöglichen können. Jedoch brauchen wir nun noch
ein wenig Unterstützung bei den kleinen aber feinen Details und dazu brauchen
wir euch. 
Was wir noch kaufen wollen?



Kunstpflanzen




echte Pflanzen




stimmungsvolle Lampen




Farbe




Schiffsdekoration




Elektronik für Rätsel




Soundanlage




Ihr könnt uns durch den Erwerb verschiedener Perks
unterstützen, wie durch den Erwerb einer Plakette, welche dann auf unserem
Ausrüstungs-Schiff am Mast angebracht wird. Eins von den T-Shirts auf dem das
Logo von Akiba oder die verschiedenen Logos der Gegnerparteien abgebildet ist.
Diese haben später auch noch eine besondere Bedeutung wenn Ihr damit gekleidet
zu uns kommt.                 Symbol der Bewahrer                         Symbol der ForscherMit der Silber- oder Goldkarte habt Ihr ein Leben lang auf jedes

<h3>Update - May 9th</h3>
<p>Listen to a podcast <a href=""http://www.igameradio.com/2012/05/09/podcast-igame-chat-miralupa-does-it-the-arg-way/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">interview I gave for iGame Radio</a>, in which I talk about our project and how you can help!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello there, my name is Elie Charest and I've worked in the game business for about 16 years. Last year, I started my own indie game studio, Miralupa, along with two long-time friends. We invested our own money in the project and raised the equivalent from family and friends who believed in us.</p>
<p>A year later, we've successfully published our first iPhone/iPad game: <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/app/chromian-wars/id473788469"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Chromian Wars on the App Store"">Chromian Wars</a>, a miniature tank battle game in Augmented Reality! However, we weren't quite able to take it where we wanted to. In particular, we didn't quite have the budget to include one of the key elements of the game: a multiplayer mode where iOS and Android users can customize their tanks and go against each other in augmented reality arenas!</p>
<p>Now, our baby is at a crossroads. Since launching the game we've been busy doing work-for-hire projects as we continue making small improvements and updates on evenings and week-ends (the Android version, in particular, should be out this Spring).</p>
<p>We really believe this game has a chance to be successful if we can make it what it was always  meant to be: the first game to allow mobile gamers on competing platforms to play together in a shared augmented reality space. Please help us make that dream a reality and prove that crowdfunding is a viable alternative to game financing by funding this project!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, Chromian Wars has been a labor of love for Miralupa's three founders. A successfully crowdfunding campaign will have an enormous impact on the games's future, and by extension of the future of our studio as a independent game developer. Failure to meet our target, on the other hand, will likely push back the development of Chromian Wars' multiplayer mode by months, and may kill the project altogether. While the company will go on, generating enough revenue from work-for-hire to live and grow, part of the dream will have died along with this crucial part of our development strategy.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Basically, we've estimated the financial cost of completing the multiplayer mode and providing some basic tank customization (new weapons, armor, paint coat, etc.) at a little less than 15,000$. This is mostly salaries for programmers and 3D artists, middleware licence costs, as well as a little bit of marketing money to get the word out about the ""new and improved"" version of Chromian Wars.</p>
<p>Should we exceed our goal, any additional money will go into producing more downloadable content for players to customize their tanks with, improving the game in general, and putting more money into marketing to make sure the game receives the attention it deserves. We may also offer more perks if the campaign is a significant success!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are many ways you can help us in addition to pledging money to the project: you can talk about it on social networks, spread the word about IndieGoGo in general (and our project in particular), download and try the free version of our game on iOS (iPhone 4/4S, iPod Touch 4th generaion, iPad 2/New iPad) while it is still available, give it a high rating on the App Store, show it to friends and convince them how cool it would be to play the game with them in real-time augmented reality, and so on.</p>
<p>We have poured our heart and soul into this project. Please help us take it to the next level to realize its full potential, and keep alive the dream of these indie game developers!</p>

<p>
Rampage Knights is a cooperative beat 'em up game mixed up with randomized dungeon crawling and exploration which you can play alone or with a friend online.
</p>
<p>
You play as a hero trapped by a spell in a magical forest. All paths lead to a nearby ruined castle, where the source of the black magic covering the land is dwelling.
</p>
<p>
The game is inspired by the catchy formula of Binding of Isaac mixed with classic melee combat from games like Golden Axe. Each run you start with a bare hero and your goal is to get as far as possible in a dungeon with randomized items, spells, traps and encounters. Along the way your character evolves and changes (visually and gameplay-wise) as you find better weapons, items, magic powers and fight harder and harder monsters. Eventually you reach the final boss at the bottom of the pit (or your death).
</p>
<p>
You can play the game alone or with a friend online. We decided to focus online multiplayer on two people for now, mainly for technical reasons. If we see enough interest in the project we will add a stretch goal for three or four people multiplayer.

<li> Gameplay is split into short (up to 60 minutes) separate runs.
</li>
<li> Your hero evolves with new abilities and visually changes along the way.
</li>
<li> The game contains a lot of spells, weapons and other items with game changing properties.
</li>
<li> There is a long term progression system where you can level up different classes of your hero and unlock new things in the game.
</li>
</ul><br/><p>
<b>The Combat</b>
</p>
<p>
The game is focused on melee fighting. You possess a small but effective palette of deadly moves to quickly dispatch large groups of enemies. You can dash through groups of enemies, lift bodies in the air and throw them at others, crush lying monsters with stomping, swing the bodies around or juggle with the enemies in the air. Main sources of inspiration for the fighting style were games like Golden Axe or Castle Crashers.
</p>

<b>The Dungeon</b>
</p>
<p>
Randomly generated environment provides many special encounters, which will define your adventure and shape your hero. You will die a lot, but every time you play you get wildly different set of weapons, spells, magical features and also curses and disadvantages that will give you different opportunities and challenges.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668996/files/20140623091326-thedung.jpg?1403540006"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>
<b>The Loot</b>
</p>
<p>
The game has large variety of items, that do more than just raising your damage. Imagine a sword that drops a crushing treasure chest from the sky when you hit multiple enemies. A boots that freeze an enemy, if you kick him in the groin. These are a few examples.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668997/files/20140623091331-theloot.jpg?1403540011"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>
<b>The Magic</b>
</p>
<p>
On your journey you will learn powerful spells a skills, that add another form of attack. Some are classic like fireballs, some have weird effects, like a device that spawns machines capable to immobilize enemies or crack chests open. Others can drag enemies around or enchant them.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668998/files/20140623091339-themagic.jpg?1403540019"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>
<b>The Hero</b>
</p>
<p>
The items and encounters can change your hero completely. You may go through the adventure as a glass cannon berserk, a bloodthirsty vampire who can heal of defeated enemies, or an undead who cannot heal at all. You may learn to fly or lose your jumping ability completely. You can turn into a monster or superhero with crazy powers. All depends on what resources you find in the dark depths below and how you decide to use them.
</p>

<b>The Campaign</b>
</p>
<p>
The gameplay is split into relatively short (up to 60 minutes) easy to pick up runs. It's something like a campaign in Left 4 Dead or a mission in Killing Floor. The combat is very challenging and you will probably die a lot, but with every respawn you will explore a new maze, you will get better and more experienced and you will each farther in the depths of the labyrinth.
</p>

<p>
<b>Rampage Knights</b> is more than just a quick action and a bunch of disjointed raids on the castle. When you die, you may lose your weapons and items, but you keep your combat experience. And with every attempt your hero gets better and better as you progress deeper into the dungeons of the dark castle.
</p>
<p>
After death you are resurrected in a camp of travelers you met in the woods, and who are trapped in the enchanted forest just like you. These NPCs give you several interestiong options! Let's meet the guys!

<p>
You cannot descent into the labyrinth without proper equipment. Apart from your melee weapon your hero have a <b>spell</b>, a <b>potion</b>, a <b>magic scroll</b> and <b>throwing weapons</b>.
</p>
<p>
It's much like Left 4 Dead, where you had your weapons, medkit and pills. You can carry only one item of each kind, so you need to use your limited inventory wisely to survive various enemy types and traps.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/669006/files/20140623091444-inv.jpg?1403540084"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
In addition to inventory items, you will find <b>armors</b>, <b>belts</b>, <b>boots</b> and also special type of items that can be used to permanently change your hero's appearance and abilities. Bigger items like armors are visible on your character.
</p>
<p>
To give you the taste what's in the game, here are weapons we have created so far.

Do you want to be in the game? There is a lot of ancient paintings hanging on the walls of the castle you explore. And some of them may have your likeness! This perk will <b>get your face on the paintings in the game</b>. The paintings are also slightly animated, so you will laugh, lift eyebrows or change the face as the heroes approach your painting. Here is an example of the end result:
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/669120/files/20140623094627-boovie1.gif?1403541987"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/669121/files/20140623094634-boovie2.gif?1403541994"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>
This is the top level perk for the most generous patrons. ""Dungeon Master"" gives
you the right to directly influence Rampage Knights by adding 3 key elements to the gameplay:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>A weapon</b>. You may help us to design an appearance and magical properties of a sword, an axe or a mace in the game. Weapon magic in our game can considerably change the game, heroes or even the environment.
</li>
<li> <b>A potion</b>. You have the power to mix your own rare potion in the game. Potions are one of four core items used by the heroes to survive in the dungeon. You may devise whatever concievable mix of positive, negative, random or funny effects. Your brew can make the heroes levite or give them tails, greatly increate their strength or turn their heads into potatoes. That's up to you!
</li>
<li> <b>An encounter</b>. You can create one type of special room or object in the game. Heroes meet these randomly in the labyrinth and they pose various threats and challenges for them. An example of such thing is a treasure room, where you can try to lockpick a chest full of gold and items.
Another example is an <i>iron maiden</i> - a huge sinister metal case containing unknown dangerous monster. Heroes may choose to break it, release the monster and collect the reward for the kill. Or they may leave it be and run.
</li>
</ul><p>
The ""Dungeon Master"" perk also contains the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> You will get a large animated portrait in the game.
</li>
<li> You will be listed on top of the backers section in game credits with your portrait, name and your contribution in the game. See <a href=""http://download.rakeingrass.com/rampage_knights_demo/credits/credits.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">preview of the credits</a>.
</li>
<li> Everything from the ""Big Package"" perk.
</li>
</ul><br/><p>
We reserve right to veto anything offensive, too hard to realize or game breaking.
</p>
<p>
This perk is limited to 3 people.

<p>
<b>Why Indiegogo campaign?</b>
</p>
<p>
We are far into the development of this game, but this is the moment when we need some outside help. We pump a lot of time and effort into the game design, code and graphics every day. Now we could use that extra push that will allow us to finish things in best possible and polished way, to outsource stuff we cannot do ourselves (like music), to improve networking etc.
</p>
<p>
We also want to test the interest of the public, get valuable feedback and suggestions and start some buzz around the game to let the world know that Rampage Knights are here and getting ready.
</p>
<p>
<b>What is the money for?</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Music and sounds. We don't have musician in out team so need to outsource.
</li>
<li> Networking integration with Steam. We are hiring an external guy who will be implementing seamless
integration with Steam so you and your friend can join an online game without a hassle.
</li>
<li> Port of the game to Linux and Mac with proper gamepad support.
</li>
<li> More game content. The more interest we generate with the Indiegogo campaign
the more and crazier stuff we will be able to add in the game.
</li>
</ul><p>
<b>What are the risks? What's the status of the project now?</b>
</p>
<p>
The only weakness of our team is, how slow we are. Knowing this we deliberately pushed the start of this campaign in the late stage of the development with release date in sight. We ask for your help now to successfuly finish this with as much good stuff in the game as possible!
</p>
<p>
Most of the important things - the combat, the environment generation, basic networking, hero profiles, etc. - is in the game already or partially finished. You can test it in the <a href=""http://download.rakeingrass.com/rampage_knights_demo/demo.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">demo</a>. We just started to implement bosses. Our goal and the biggest time consumer in the next few months will be to fill the game up with more content, and polish and balance the gameplay.
</p>
<p>
<b>When will the game be released?</b>
</p>
<p>
If we succeed, we will most probably get the game out of the gates in the beginning of 2015 (maybe earlier but not later). In fall 2014 we plan to start beta testing with backers in order to tweak the balance of the game and gather suggestions from larger audience. If the game gets through Greenlight the beta will be also available on Steam and we may also consider starting an Early Access program on Steam.
</p>
<p>
<b>Will the game run on Mac or Linux? Will you support gamepad XY?</b>
</p>
<p>
The game will run on Windows, Mac and maybe Linux, if we get enough backing. The demo now supports only Xbox 360 controller on Windows but the final game will support more gamepads on all platforms via SDL library.
</p>
<p>
<b>Can I play online with a friend on a different platform?</b>
</p>
<p>
Yes. You will be able to run the game on Windows and play online with a friend on Linux or Mac.
</p>
<p>
<b>Will I get Steam key?</b>
</p>
<p>
Yes. Once the game gets on Steam all backers will receive keys to redeem the game on Steam. Of course only in case the game gets through Greenlight. (Please <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=272377354"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vote for us</a>.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Will the game supports 3 or 4 players online co-op?</b>
</p>
<p>
For now we promise only 2 players online co-op mode because supporting more players is much harder for technical reasons and would also require extra gameplay tweaks. If the Indiegogo campaign is successful we may add a stretch goal for 3 or 4 players online mode. Also note that 3 or 4 players online will be supported only in Steam version of the game.
</p>
<p>
<b>Will the game supports 2 players local co-op on the same machine?</b>
</p>
<p>
Local co-op is not supported for now. We may add this feature later when the game will be approaching the release date.
</p>
<p>
<b>What is the difference between Steam and non-Steam version?</b>
</p>
<p>
Steam version:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking using Steam matchmaking so playing online is as simple as pressing a button.
</li>
<li>Steam achievements and stuff.
</li>
<li>If we support 3 or 4 players online in the future it will be implemented in the Steam version.
</li>
<li>Automatic gamepad configuration from Steam big picture mode.
</li>
</ul><p>
Non-Steam version:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking similar to how it works in the <a href=""http://download.rakeingrass.com/rampage_knights_demo/demo.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">
tech demo</a>.
</li>
<li>Only 2 players online mode.
</li>
</ul><p>
<b>I don't have money / I don't trust you enough to pay so early, but the game looks interesting.</b>
</p>
<p>
That's okay. We are poor and paranoid too :D. You can still help a lot by spreading the word about the game and voting for us on Greenlight.
</p>
<p>
Your involvement is crucial as there are thousands of small indie games out there and we have zero budget for marketing. It's very hard for us to let the world know we even exist, so your help would be invaluable.
</p>
<p>
Getting on Steam is another big deal. It's not just about sales. This is a multiplayer game. Networking is a really hard thing to do and Steam services will help a lot. The Steam version of the game will be integrated with Steam matchmaking so starting an online game will become much more comfortable.

<p><b>END</b></p></div>","Lost in an enchanted forest, our brave heroes encounter a hideous evil warlock! In a blink of an eye their powerful weapons are destroyed and treasures stolen as they are overpowered by the enchanter's foul magic!
But this cannot be!

It's time to get up and fight! It's time to get your loot back and taste sweet revenge! It's time to start the RAMPAGE!




Rampage Knights is a cooperative beat 'em up game mixed up with randomized dungeon crawling and exploration which you can play alone or with a friend online.


You play as a hero trapped by a spell in a magical forest. All paths lead to a nearby ruined castle, where the source of the black magic covering the land is dwelling.


The game is inspired by the catchy formula of Binding of Isaac mixed with classic melee combat from games like Golden Axe. Each run you start with a bare hero and your goal is to get as far as possible in a dungeon with randomized items, spells, traps and encounters. Along the way your character evolves and changes (visually and gameplay-wise) as you find better weapons, items, magic powers and fight harder and harder monsters. Eventually you reach the final boss at the bottom of the pit (or your death).


You can play the game alone or with a friend online. We decided to focus online multiplayer on two people for now, mainly for technical reasons. If we see enough interest in the project we will add a stretch goal for three or four people multiplayer.





The main features of the game are:


 Melee combat inspired by games like Golden Axe.

 Randomly generated environment.

 Gameplay is split into short (up to 60 minutes) separate runs.

 Your hero evolves with new abilities and visually changes along the way.

 The game contains a lot of spells, weapons and other items with game changing properties.

 There is a long term progression system where you can level up different classes of your hero and unlock new things in the game.


The Combat


The game is focused on melee fighting. You possess a small but effective palette of deadly moves to quickly dispatch large groups of enemies. You can dash through groups of enemies, lift bodies in the air and throw them at others, crush lying monsters with stomping, swing the bodies around or juggle with the enemies in the air. Main sources of inspiration for the fighting style were games like Golden Axe or Castle Crashers.


The Dungeon


Randomly generated environment provides many special encounters, which will define your adventure and shape your hero. You will die a lot, but every time you play you get wildly different set of weapons, spells, magical features and also curses and disadvantages that will give you different opportunities and challenges.


The Loot


The game has large variety of items, that do more than just raising your damage. Imagine a sword that drops a crushing treasure chest from the sky when you hit multiple enemies. A boots that freeze an enemy, if you kick him in the groin. These are a few examples.


The Magic


On your journey you will learn powerful spells a skills, that add another form of attack. Some are classic like fireballs, some have weird effects, like a device that spawns machines capable to immobilize enemies or crack chests open. Others can drag enemies around or enchant them.


The Hero


The items and encounters can change your hero completely. You may go through the adventure as a glass cannon berserk, a bloodthirsty vampire who can heal of defeated enemies, or an undead who cannot heal at all. You may learn to fly or lose your jumping ability completely. You can turn into a monster or superhero with crazy powers. All depends on what resources you find in the dark depths below and how you decide to use them.


The Campaign


The gameplay is split into relatively short (up to 60 minutes) easy to pick up runs. It's something like a campaign in Left 4 Dead or a mission in Killing Floor. The combat is very challenging and you will probably die a lot, but with every respawn you will explore a new maze, you will get better and more experienced and you will each farther in the depths of the labyrinth.




Rampage Knights is more than just a quick action and a bunch of disjointed raids on the castle. When you die, you may lose your weapons and items, but you keep your combat experience. And with every attempt your hero gets better and better as you progress deeper into the dungeons of the dark castle.


After death you are resurrected in a camp of travelers you met in the woods, and who are trapped in the enchanted forest just like you. These NPCs give you several interestiong options! Let's meet the guys!





You cannot descent into the labyrinth without proper equipment. Apart from your melee weapon your hero have a spell, a potion, a magic scroll and throwing weapons.


It's much like Left 4 Dead, where you had your weapons, medkit and pills. You can carry only one item of each kind, so you need to use your limited inventory wisely to survive various enemy types and traps.



In addition to inventory items, you will find armors, belts, boots and also special type of items that can be used to permanently change your hero's appearance and abilities. Bigger items like armors are visible on your character.


To give you the taste what's in the game, here are weapons we have created so far.





Some of the things we plan to add that might trigger your interest:







What can you expect, if the campaign is successful and the game picks up significant interest? Here are some things we have on a ""nice-to-have"" list, which may end up in stretch goals in case we get lucky:



Local co-op mode. Play with your friend on one machine.

Warrior with different body type: woman, dwarf, giant.

Co-op for 3 or 4 people.

More detailed customization of a hero.

More content - enemies, items, bosses, unique encounters etc.

More comfortable networking for non-Steam version.

More platforms (PS4?).






Here is more detailed info on perks.


* Note that Steam keys are applicable only if we succeed in our Greenlight campaign. Please vote for Rampage Knights on Greenlight to make sure that the Steam version becomes reality!



This is the basic perk. Once the game is released you get a download link for a full version and a Steam key*.


You get a beta access. We plan to start the beta in fall 2014 in order to tweak the balance of the game and gather suggestions from larger audience. If the game gets through Greenlight the beta will be also available on Steam. Once the game is released you get a download link for a full version and a Steam key*.


Rampage Knights is a multiplayer game. ""Double trouble"" perk get you the game and also an extra copy and an extra Steam key*, so you can give it to your friend and play together. You both will also get the access to the beta/Early Access*.


You get everything from ""Double Trouble"" perk. On top of that you get a Steam key for a side scrolling shooter Jets'n'Guns and a PDF handbook for Rampage Knight containing detailed info on all enemies, weapons, items, encounters and other stuff in the dungeon.


You get everything from ""Swords and Jets"" perk and a pack of five games from Rake in Grass.
The pack contains:
Archibald's Adventures,
Crystal Cave,
Larva Mortus,
Northmark and
Styrateg.


Maybe you feel generous, maybe you really like Rake in Grass and want this game to succeed. You can throw in an extra 10 bucks to help us. For that your name (and nick name optionally) will be listed in the game credits in section for the top backers. See preview of the credits. Of course you get everything from the ""Big Package"" perk.


This perk is limited to 100 people.


Do you want to be in the game? There is a lot of ancient paintings hanging on the walls of the castle you explore. And some of them may have your likeness! This perk will get your face on the paintings in the game. The paintings are also slightly animated, so you will laugh, lift eyebrows or change the face as the heroes approach your painting. Here is an example of the end result:



The ""Night in the Gallery"" perk will get you:


Your face in one of the animated paintings.

A special place in credits with your painting and name. See preview of the credits.

Everything from the ""Big Package"" perk.


This perk is limited to 20 people.


This is the top level perk for the most generous patrons. ""Dungeon Master"" gives
you the right to directly influence Rampage Knights by adding 3 key elements to the gameplay:


 A weapon. You may help us to design an appearance and magical properties of a sword, an axe or a mace in the game. Weapon magic in our game can considerably change the game, heroes or even the environment.

 A potion. You have the power to mix your own rare potion in the game. Potions are one of four core items used by the heroes to survive in the dungeon. You may devise whatever concievable mix of positive, negative, random or funny effects. Your brew can make the heroes levite or give them tails, greatly increate their strength or turn their heads into potatoes. That's up to you!

 An encounter. You can create one type of special room or object in the game. Heroes meet these randomly in the labyrinth and they pose various threats and challenges for them. An example of such thing is a treasure room, where you can try to lockpick a chest full of gold and items.
Another example is an iron maiden - a huge sinister metal case containing unknown dangerous monster. Heroes may choose to break it, release the monster and collect the reward for the kill. Or they may leave it be and run.


The ""Dungeon Master"" perk also contains the following:


 You will get a large animated portrait in the game.

 You will be listed on top of the backers section in game credits with your portrait, name and your contribution in the game. See preview of the credits.

 Everything from the ""Big Package"" perk.


We reserve right to veto anything offensive, too hard to realize or game breaking.


This perk is limited to 3 people.



Why Indiegogo campaign?


We are far into the development of this game, but this is the moment when we need some outside help. We pump a lot of time and effort into the game design, code and graphics every day. Now we could use that extra push that will allow us to finish things in best possible and polished way, to outsource stuff we cannot do ourselves (like music), to improve networking etc.


We also want to test the interest of the public, get valuable feedback and suggestions and start some buzz around the game to let the world know that Rampage Knights are here and getting ready.


What is the money for?


 Music and sounds. We don't have musician in out team so need to outsource.

 Networking integration with Steam. We are hiring an external guy who will be implementing seamless
integration with Steam so you and your friend can join an online game without a hassle.

 Port of the game to Linux and Mac with proper gamepad support.

 More game content. The more interest we generate with the Indiegogo campaign
the more and crazier stuff we will be able to add in the game.


What are the risks? What's the status of the project now?


The only weakness of our team is, how slow we are. Knowing this we deliberately pushed the start of this campaign in the late stage of the development with release date in sight. We ask for your help now to successfuly finish this with as much good stuff in the game as possible!


Most of the important things - the combat, the environment generation, basic networking, hero profiles, etc. - is in the game already or partially finished. You can test it in the demo. We just started to implement bosses. Our goal and the biggest time consumer in the next few months will be to fill the game up with more content, and polish and balance the gameplay.


When will the game be released?


If we succeed, we will most probably get the game out of the gates in the beginning of 2015 (maybe earlier but not later). In fall 2014 we plan to start beta testing with backers in order to tweak the balance of the game and gather suggestions from larger audience. If the game gets through Greenlight the beta will be also available on Steam and we may also consider starting an Early Access program on Steam.


Will the game run on Mac or Linux? Will you support gamepad XY?


The game will run on Windows, Mac and maybe Linux, if we get enough backing. The demo now supports only Xbox 360 controller on Windows but the final game will support more gamepads on all platforms via SDL library.


Can I play online with a friend on a different platform?


Yes. You will be able to run the game on Windows and play online with a friend on Linux or Mac.


Will I get Steam key?


Yes. Once the game gets on Steam all backers will receive keys to redeem the game on Steam. Of course only in case the game gets through Greenlight. (Please vote for us.)


Will the game supports 3 or 4 players online co-op?


For now we promise only 2 players online co-op mode because supporting more players is much harder for technical reasons and would also require extra gameplay tweaks. If the Indiegogo campaign is successful we may add a stretch goal for 3 or 4 players online mode. Also note that 3 or 4 players online will be supported only in Steam version of the game.


Will the game supports 2 players local co-op on the same machine?


Local co-op is not supported for now. We may add this feature later when the game will be approaching the release date.


What is the difference between Steam and non-Steam version?


Steam version:


Networking using Steam matchmaking so playing online is as simple as pressing a button.

Steam achievements and stuff.

If we support 3 or 4 players online in the future it will be implemented in the Steam version.

Automatic gamepad configuration from Steam big picture mode.


Non-Steam version:


Networking similar to how it works in the 
tech demo.

Only 2 players online mode.


I don't have money / I don't trust you enough to pay so early, but the game looks interesting.


That's okay. We are poor and paranoid too :D. You can still help a lot by spreading the word about the game and voting for us on Greenlight.


Your involvement is crucial as there are thousands of small indie games out there and we have zero budget for marketing. It's very hard for us to let the world know we even exist, so your help would be invaluable.


Getting on Steam is another big deal. It's not just about sales. This is a multiplayer game. Networking is a really hard thing to do and Steam services will help a lot. The Steam version of the game will be integrated with Steam matchmaking so starting an online game will become much more comfortable.



Help us and get involved. Even if you cannot contribute to the campaign directly you can still support us by telling everybody about the game!

<p>In February 2015, a rat in London is infected by a virus that causes excessive testosterone buildup and aggression. After one month, the virus spreads to a large part of the rat population. Pest control becomes aware of the changed behaviour and captures some of the rats. One person is bitten and becomes infected.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469027867/spios0epanyizocxcnnu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The disease mutates and becomes airborne with an incubation time of three weeks. It worsens, causing muscle ache, confusion and fatigue. Within a week, patient one dies from respiratory failure; within a few more weeks, many other fatalities are recorded in central Europe, the US East Coast and China.</p>
<p>News outlets catch on and the reports of an aggressive and lethal flu cause people to flock to hospitals, propagating the disease. The World Health Organisation issues a warning for people to stay indoors. The infection spreads across major cities, infecting people and rats. Rat populations become more aggressive, making containment difficult.</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469089576/xvqk4jzv9b75o2hntfnb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>After 8 weeks WHO issues a global pandemic alarm and attempts to contain and quarantine the disease. Large swathes of population begin to show symptoms, slowing government down. People start to hoard supplies and lock themselves at home in order to avoid contact with others. Meanwhile, rat populations boom and take to the streets, invading supermarkets and homes in order to find food.</p>
<p>The death toll keeps rising. Governments cease to function. Infrastructure falls apart, and nuclear power plants start shutting down reactors and securing spent fuel rods. The infection hits remote areas. Looting becomes widespread.</p>
<p>The power grid fails when the power plants run out of manpower. The people who have survived the infection or who have had immunity to it begin to emerge to the new, post-pandemic world.</p>
<p>You are one of those people.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://happyhobgoblin.com/indiegogo/Gameplay.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </p>
<p>Nyheim is a single-player dice-rolling game in the same vein as Elder Sign Omens and Warhammer Quest. The core of the game are the survivor dice, representing the four attributes that the post-pandemic world will test: Wits, Awareness, Endurance and Speed. The attributes are used in everything, from fighting the rats to learning new abilities.</p>
<p>Get strategic with the Nyheim Map! Your Party will move on the map of Nyheim, from location to location. In a location the player can either search for supplies or progress on your objective, or rest and heal your injuries.<br/> </p>

<p><br/>When rolling dice, you can use food to reroll your results, but beware: If your food runs out, you run the risk of starvation! To further help you succeed, items and skills will also give you rerolls, or allow you to turn your results to other results!<br/> </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://happyhobgoblin.com/indiegogo/roll616.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><p> </p>
<p>The changing seasons will force you to adapt: As time progresses, rats will get fewer but tougher and supplies found from scavenging will become worse…</p>
<p>Permadeath will keep you on your toes: Each game will have randomly generated locations and characters and each choice you make will be permanent!<br/> </p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://happyhobgoblin.com/indiegogo/assign616.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><p> </p>

<p><br/>Here is a round-up of the main areas we’re currently working on. <br/><br/><strong>Story Mode:</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>While the standard game mode is already developed, we want to create something more narrative-driven. In the Story Mode you’ll be able to play as the first survivor of Nyheim and lead the efforts for the rebuilding of the city – and will span the first year post-pandemic.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to unlock larger regions as your population grows, and face larger challenges while the weather gets colder and winter starts setting in…</p>
<p>The campaign will feature custom objectives to drive the game forward.<br/><br/><strong>Updated visuals:</strong></p>
<p>We are aiming to replace the current 2D map of Nyheim with a 3D version! We’re aiming for a miniature landscape style, so you can be even more immersed in the city of Nyheim, along with a dynamic soundscape and animations to boot. Think a mix between Civilization V and Cities Skylines.</p>
<p>Plus we want to add more animations and effects for the cards, just for some pretty eye candy!<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://happyhobgoblin.com/indiegogo/prototypemap2.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/><strong>Alternative gameplay:</strong></p>
<p><i>Supply Currency</i> - Food, items and characters that you send to the HQ will be turned into “currency” that you can use to buy supplies, allowing for a better control over what you need! Upgrading your HQ with the currencies will unlock better quality supplies!</p>
<p><i>More crises</i> - More variable crisis effects, like Threat spawning, and an alternative crisis system that exchanges the Crisis defeat for more and nastier crises</p>

<p><br/><i>Crafting cards</i> - Crafting cards that give powerful rewards, such as items, food or even direct injury healing after being used while resting.</p>

<p>Nyheim is the first game project Happy Hobgoblin is working on, and for many of our intrepid developers it is their first trial by fire. But we do have two major advantages: Samuli’s experience in game development and the fact that Nyheim mobile is complete. The swordfighting card game that Samuli designed, Audatia, already won over the hearts of many swordsmanship hobbyists and raised a successful campaign here in Indiegogo. The mobile version of Nyheim has been in development for over year and a half, so the developers know the ins and outs of the project.</p>
<p>While every person at Happy Hobgoblin is eager to develop games, Nyheim is the company’s first project and not everyone has experience in game releases. Countless basement projects aside, only one game project has been released and has been a success in its own niche: Audatia, designed by our own Samuli. So the trials and tribulations of getting the game to the digital marketplaces may give our producer some more gray hairs. However, we do have Square Enix supporting our campaign!

In February 2015, a rat in London is infected by a virus that causes excessive testosterone buildup and aggression. After one month, the virus spreads to a large part of the rat population. Pest control becomes aware of the changed behaviour and captures some of the rats. One person is bitten and becomes infected. 

The disease mutates and becomes airborne with an incubation time of three weeks. It worsens, causing muscle ache, confusion and fatigue. Within a week, patient one dies from respiratory failure; within a few more weeks, many other fatalities are recorded in central Europe, the US East Coast and China.
News outlets catch on and the reports of an aggressive and lethal flu cause people to flock to hospitals, propagating the disease. The World Health Organisation issues a warning for people to stay indoors. The infection spreads across major cities, infecting people and rats. Rat populations become more aggressive, making containment difficult.

After 8 weeks WHO issues a global pandemic alarm and attempts to contain and quarantine the disease. Large swathes of population begin to show symptoms, slowing government down. People start to hoard supplies and lock themselves at home in order to avoid contact with others. Meanwhile, rat populations boom and take to the streets, invading supermarkets and homes in order to find food.
The death toll keeps rising. Governments cease to function. Infrastructure falls apart, and nuclear power plants start shutting down reactors and securing spent fuel rods. The infection hits remote areas. Looting becomes widespread.
The power grid fails when the power plants run out of manpower. The people who have survived the infection or who have had immunity to it begin to emerge to the new, post-pandemic world.
You are one of those people.
 
 
Nyheim is a single-player dice-rolling game in the same vein as Elder Sign Omens and Warhammer Quest. The core of the game are the survivor dice, representing the four attributes that the post-pandemic world will test: Wits, Awareness, Endurance and Speed. The attributes are used in everything, from fighting the rats to learning new abilities.
Get strategic with the Nyheim Map! Your Party will move on the map of Nyheim, from location to location. In a location the player can either search for supplies or progress on your objective, or rest and heal your injuries. 

When rolling dice, you can use food to reroll your results, but beware: If your food runs out, you run the risk of starvation! To further help you succeed, items and skills will also give you rerolls, or allow you to turn your results to other results! 
 
The changing seasons will force you to adapt: As time progresses, rats will get fewer but tougher and supplies found from scavenging will become worse…
Permadeath will keep you on your toes: Each game will have randomly generated locations and characters and each choice you make will be permanent!   
Balance between the well-being of your search party and HQ: Each survivor, item or food that you don’t use will be taken to the HQ, where it can be used to add progress to your new society!
Objectives and crises pull you in different directions: Will you handle the looming disease that threatens your populations, or do you power through the next task towards relighting the city? 
 
Here is a round-up of the main areas we’re currently working on. Story Mode:

While the standard game mode is already developed, we want to create something more narrative-driven. In the Story Mode you’ll be able to play as the first survivor of Nyheim and lead the efforts for the rebuilding of the city – and will span the first year post-pandemic.
You’ll be able to unlock larger regions as your population grows, and face larger challenges while the weather gets colder and winter starts setting in…
The campaign will feature custom objectives to drive the game forward.Updated visuals:
We are aiming to replace the current 2D map of Nyheim with a 3D version! We’re aiming for a miniature landscape style, so you can be even more immersed in the city of Nyheim, along with a dynamic soundscape and animations to boot. Think a mix between Civilization V and Cities Skylines.
Plus we want to add more animations and effects for the cards, just for some pretty eye candy! 

Alternative gameplay:
Supply Currency - Food, items and characters that you send to the HQ will be turned into “currency” that you can use to buy supplies, allowing for a better control over what you need! Upgrading your HQ with the currencies will unlock better quality supplies!
More crises - More variable crisis effects, like Threat spawning, and an alternative crisis system that exchanges the Crisis defeat for more and nastier crises

Crafting cards - Crafting cards that give powerful rewards, such as items, food or even direct injury healing after being used while resting.
 

HAPPY HOBGOBLIN
Happy Hobgoblin is a group of game development professionals who found each other in Oulu Game Lab-program. After working together for a year on the Nyheim mobile, the team bonds are tight and everyone is itching to get to develop the game to its maximum potential! 

 

 
We believe in cool games. We believe that people would like to play niche games that aim high and try new and unconventional things. So we want to give you this chance to support a cool game, to show the world that yes, you can take a leap of faith.
The team is dedicated to bringing Nyheim to its full potential. While we’re also creating a mobile version of the game, we’re really excited about the extra depth we can add to the PC version and with your help we will be able to concentrate on making Nyheim the best it can be.
This involves adding resource for additional artists to further illustrate and polish the visuals of the game, along with more music and soundscapes. And more importantly, we can gather feedback and involve you in the development of the game. Because as important as our vision of Nyheim is, your feedback is as important, if not more so.THE PERKS!Here are our awesome perk rewards! EARLY CAT GETS THE RAT & I'D LIKE THE GAME PLEASE  DOUBLE THE FUN - ANDROID       +  DOUBLE THE FUN - iOS  +  DELUXE EDITION  +   /   +    +  CREDIT EDITION  +   /   +    +    +CITIZEN EDITION  +   /  +    +    ++  RAT-CATCHER EDITION  +   /  +    +    ++  CARD-SHARK EDITION  +   /  +    +    ++    +  SURVIVOR EDITION  +   /  +    +    ++    +  SUPPLY EDITION  +   /  +    +    ++    +   + CONNOISSEUR EDITION  +   /  +    +    ++    +   +  +  TASK EDITION  +   /  +    +    ++    +   +  +  CRISIS EDITION  +   /  +    +    ++    +   + +  EXECUTIVE PRODUCER  +   /  +    +    ++    +   + +

Nyheim is the first game project Happy Hobgoblin is working on, and for many of our intrepid developers it is their first trial by fire. But we do have two major advantages: Samuli’s experience in game development and the fact that Nyheim mobile is complete. The swordfighting card game that Samuli designed, Audatia, already won over the hearts of many swordsmanship hobbyists and raised a successful campaign here in Indiegogo. The mobile version of Nyheim has been in development for over year and a half, so the developers know the ins and outs of the project.
While every person at Happy Hobgoblin is eager to develop games, Nyheim is the company’s first project and not everyone has experience in game releases. Countless basement projects aside, only one game project has been released and has been a success in its own niche: Audatia, designed by our own Samuli. So the trials and tribulations of getting the game to the digital marketplaces may give our producer some more gray hairs. However, we do have Square Enix supporting our campaign! We have pitched Nyheim in the Square Enix Collective and gamers showed their support, opening this possibility.

<p>Nightkeep is a project I’ve been working on for the past 2 years. My goal is to craft a fine metroidvania RPG set in a fairytale-like world.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:20px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nightkeep.rpg2heaven.com/img/e02.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>While Nightkeep is influenced by Castlevania series (this shows the most in the design of Nyros’ Castle), it is also influenced by many games from the SNES and PlayStation eras, such as Breath of Fire, FInal Fantasy, Alundra and Dragon’s quest. Without these titles, I’d probably never get into game development in the first place. This games, however, isn’t just about a castle and some crazed king.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:20px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nightkeep.rpg2heaven.com/img/e01n.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The gameplay is primarily based on quests, which are not divided into main or side quests. Every single one has its place in the game’s world.</p>
<p>You play as Arietta, one of the hunters, coming to the Nightkeep village, where she has a job to do and important decisions to make. Some of the events she won’t be able to alter, others however will directly impact the world around her.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:20px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nightkeep.rpg2heaven.com/img/f02.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By fulfilling different quests, you get “rank points”, which upgrade your abilities, open up new quests and cause various scenarios across the game world. Your rank, aside from being a way to upgrade your stats, is also a crucial element of the story.</p>
<p>All this game needs is chance.</p>
<p><strong>The game features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Original fantasy story with fairytale elements.</li>
<li>Original artwork and soundtrack</li>
<li>Many various quests and NPCs</li>
<li>Multiple endings</li>
<li>Classic RPG elements - EXPs, a leveling system, equipable items and power ups.</li>
<li>More than 70 different items</li>
<li>Slight rogue-like elements</li>
<li>Supported platforms: MS Windows</li>
</ul>

<p>Long ago, the world was divided into 4 different kingdoms. A chain of events, however, caused one king to disappear, leaving the 3 kingdoms fighting over his lands.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:120px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nightkeep.rpg2heaven.com/img/npcs2.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All that is in the past now. Let’s jump 735 years into the future, where two huntresses are on their way to the Nightkeep village, sent by their guild. There’s work waiting for them there, alongside many difficult decisions, which could alter the fate of the entire kingdom. The story will gradually uncover the events that have occurred in the kingdom, the meaning of the Guild of Hunters and also incorporate the already mentioned “rank”.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:7px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nightkeep.rpg2heaven.com/img/nyros.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The game world will have its own backstory and structure. The game is set in the eastern kingdom, where most of the story plays out, though it might occasionally refer to inaccessible places to explain bits of the story. Most of my previous stories began small, but I always managed to grow them into complex worlds with unique characters and its own history.</p>

<p>The supervillain. Responsible for anything from the story to the design. I’m behind the pixel art, animations, game design and code you may find in Nightkeep. I’ve been making games for fun since 2000 and Nightkeep is my first larger project, which I’d like to release for both the fans of its genre and broader audience. I founded a Czech and Slovak RPG Maker community. It bears the name RPG2 Heaven, which I also like to use as a signature on all my work. A giant fan of Castlevania and JRPG games.</p>

<p>Without Thomas, we couldn’t get to where we are now. He’s translated the Nightkeep demo and this campaign. Before that, he also localized the Greenlight campaign, which was greenlit. With his help, I’ll be able to create an English version of the final game.</p>
<p><strong>Without the rest of the team, this game wouldn’t be possible!​</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why Indiegogo and not Kickstarter?</strong> The answer is simple - using Kickstarter requires the creator to be from one of the allowed countries, which isn't our case.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to learn pixel art, so I could make my own original game. Now, it’s been 2 years, since I began my work on Nightkeep. I make games purely for the joy of making games, I don’t make any money off of them. With your help, I’d love to work on this project full-time.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nightkeep.rpg2heaven.com/img/e03m.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I’ve met many wonderful people willing to support the project, including a talented composer Thomas J. Peters, which has made 6 original tracks for the game. I’m financing the project myself and would like to properly reward everyone from the team.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nightkeep.rpg2heaven.com/img/shuffle2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I have, however, run into the point, where my income wouldn’t be enough to pay for more music tracks, which I wished to have in the demo. Because of that, the tracks for Rare monster fights, Noelle and Elleon’s theme and the village itself are not included.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nightkeep.rpg2heaven.com/img/gif6.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I’d also like to replace some tracks heard in the demo, for I have different intentions with them. For example, I want to replace the current metal version of the boss theme with a new, more JRPG-oriented one (although the metal boss theme will find its use later on in the game). I’d also like to have a different track for every character, just like in many JRPGs.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:22px;""> </p>
<p><strong>Existing features:</strong></p>
<p>Currently, about 60 monsters are finished (both art and coding), 6 bosses and about half of the game world, although some older maps need a revamp. All core systems, swords, weapons and the menu are finished. Custom key binding for keyboard and gamepad controls are supported. The storyline, however, is in its early stages and I’m slowly filling up the world with characters.</p>

<p>Why so much money for such a simple game? First, Indiegogo will get its cut from the funds raised and then the country I live in, as it is required by the law (tax, etc). A part of the money will go towards music production to ensure a great soundtrack for the game. It is an integral part of the world, providing it with great atmosphere, therefore I’m working with a professional composer to get the game to where I want it to be.</p>

<p>The rest of the money will go towards the game’s production (art, code and story) and keeping me alive (electricity and snack).

</div><p style=""margin-left:240px;""> </p></div>","This project didn't make it. Backers were refunded. I moved to smaller project, see https://www.patreon.com/pixelabcd

Play the demo! - Works well with Wine.
An ALPHA DEMO for WINDOWS is available for download here.​
Your feedback is very important, so if you encounter a bug during your playthrough of the demo, please let me know so it can be fixed.

Nightkeep is a project I’ve been working on for the past 2 years. My goal is to craft a fine metroidvania RPG set in a fairytale-like world.

While Nightkeep is influenced by Castlevania series (this shows the most in the design of Nyros’ Castle), it is also influenced by many games from the SNES and PlayStation eras, such as Breath of Fire, FInal Fantasy, Alundra and Dragon’s quest. Without these titles, I’d probably never get into game development in the first place. This games, however, isn’t just about a castle and some crazed king.

The gameplay is primarily based on quests, which are not divided into main or side quests. Every single one has its place in the game’s world.
You play as Arietta, one of the hunters, coming to the Nightkeep village, where she has a job to do and important decisions to make. Some of the events she won’t be able to alter, others however will directly impact the world around her.

By fulfilling different quests, you get “rank points”, which upgrade your abilities, open up new quests and cause various scenarios across the game world. Your rank, aside from being a way to upgrade your stats, is also a crucial element of the story.
All this game needs is chance.
The game features:

Original fantasy story with fairytale elements.
Original artwork and soundtrack
Many various quests and NPCs
Multiple endings
Classic RPG elements - EXPs, a leveling system, equipable items and power ups.
More than 70 different items
Slight rogue-like elements
Supported platforms: MS Windows


Long ago, the world was divided into 4 different kingdoms. A chain of events, however, caused one king to disappear, leaving the 3 kingdoms fighting over his lands.

All that is in the past now. Let’s jump 735 years into the future, where two huntresses are on their way to the Nightkeep village, sent by their guild. There’s work waiting for them there, alongside many difficult decisions, which could alter the fate of the entire kingdom. The story will gradually uncover the events that have occurred in the kingdom, the meaning of the Guild of Hunters and also incorporate the already mentioned “rank”.

The game world will have its own backstory and structure. The game is set in the eastern kingdom, where most of the story plays out, though it might occasionally refer to inaccessible places to explain bits of the story. Most of my previous stories began small, but I always managed to grow them into complex worlds with unique characters and its own history.

PixelABCD (Milan Svaty)
The supervillain. Responsible for anything from the story to the design. I’m behind the pixel art, animations, game design and code you may find in Nightkeep. I’ve been making games for fun since 2000 and Nightkeep is my first larger project, which I’d like to release for both the fans of its genre and broader audience. I founded a Czech and Slovak RPG Maker community. It bears the name RPG2 Heaven, which I also like to use as a signature on all my work. A giant fan of Castlevania and JRPG games.
Thomas. J. Peters
Among the sprawling reach of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, California, professional composer Thomas J. Peters crafts lavish & powerful thematic musical settings for Nightkeep.
RHLPixels (Kat Chase)When it comes to portraits, RHLPixels is a perfect choice. She’s been painting portraits from an early age and loves Breath of Fire, which has been of quite some influence for Nightkeep. With her help, every character will have its unique portrait.
Thomas Schmied 
Without Thomas, we couldn’t get to where we are now. He’s translated the Nightkeep demo and this campaign. Before that, he also localized the Greenlight campaign, which was greenlit. With his help, I’ll be able to create an English version of the final game.
Without the rest of the team, this game wouldn’t be possible!​

Why Indiegogo and not Kickstarter? The answer is simple - using Kickstarter requires the creator to be from one of the allowed countries, which isn't our case.
I’ve decided to learn pixel art, so I could make my own original game. Now, it’s been 2 years, since I began my work on Nightkeep. I make games purely for the joy of making games, I don’t make any money off of them. With your help, I’d love to work on this project full-time.

I’ve met many wonderful people willing to support the project, including a talented composer Thomas J. Peters, which has made 6 original tracks for the game. I’m financing the project myself and would like to properly reward everyone from the team.

I have, however, run into the point, where my income wouldn’t be enough to pay for more music tracks, which I wished to have in the demo. Because of that, the tracks for Rare monster fights, Noelle and Elleon’s theme and the village itself are not included.

I’d also like to replace some tracks heard in the demo, for I have different intentions with them. For example, I want to replace the current metal version of the boss theme with a new, more JRPG-oriented one (although the metal boss theme will find its use later on in the game). I’d also like to have a different track for every character, just like in many JRPGs.
 
Existing features:
Currently, about 60 monsters are finished (both art and coding), 6 bosses and about half of the game world, although some older maps need a revamp. All core systems, swords, weapons and the menu are finished. Custom key binding for keyboard and gamepad controls are supported. The storyline, however, is in its early stages and I’m slowly filling up the world with characters.

Planned features:  Main and Side storylines and quests, more characters, maps, enemies, bosses and rare monsters. “Clear the way” battle sequences, a fishing minigame, some smaller puzzles and a marker for the in-game minimap. Hairdresser.

And we are proud to say that it has succeeded in that! What's worse than drawing a plain or a garnet on your last turn? Well, having a bad hand from the beginning! The one real bad side of most TCGs is the luck factor that always plays a huge part in determining your games. But in Lifecycle, it's gone for good!Lifecycle enables you to order your deck before coming to the match, leaving luck completely out of the equation.At the same time, lifecycle has a brilliant play system that prevents players from gaining too much of an advantage, while preserving the fun and soul of the game. In fact, this system results in a much deeper experience.This feature makes Lifecycle the perfect place for competitive TCG players, the ones who are never satisfied when luck gets to play for them.In addition to this, and to eliminate any luck left from matchmaking, players will get a chance to reorder their deck after seeing their opponent's main card, the Homeland.  How many times have you gone to grab a cup of coffee because your opponent was taking 5 minutes on every turn? This will almost never happen in Lifecycle! And this is because of our innovative lead-system.An ‘action’ is any move you do in the game, except certain special moves.The lead-system will not only drastically reduce the time you spend waiting to play, but will also add huge depth to the game! Since the lead-system allows only two actions for each player before giving the lead to the other, the timing and order of your actions are suddenly crucial, game-changing decisions!Let’s explain with an example: if you wanted to play two cards that buff your unit and then attack, your opponent will get the lead after your second card, because it's your second action. Similarly, you won't get the lead until they perform two actions. So, if you wanted to attack this ""lead"", you'll have to play one card and then attack immediately. Or perhaps you'd rather play one and pass, leaving the second buff for your next lead to surprise your opponent with a huge attack, but at the risk of getting a blocker in your face.We can go on and on about the possibilities to manage your actions in different ways, but we hope you have gotten a glimpse of the depth Lifecycle has to offer. But did you think this was it? Wait until you see how this depth multiplies after getting introduced to the complete game's design! Lifecycle also presents a golden card to rule everything, the ""Homeland"". It's the first card to pick, and the one that determines your success. Your Homeland will not only determine which cards you can put in your deck, but also empowers you with a continuous ability ready from the first turn!The continues ability will be your core mechanic, and the heart of your combo. Since it is active from the beginning of the game, all you have to do is gather the pieces to build your ultimate deck!The homeland card also has locked abilities that unlock when you have the right level of power, adding another dimension to turns and action timing.These reasons make each homeland extremely unique. Each new homeland released will open new doors to new strategies. Our game is FREE TO PLAY, and we mean it!The free daily login bonus is 2 PACKS! Every day!How do you get packs in Lifecycle exactly?Simple: just play the game! Players will get a pack whenever they level up (again, just from playing!) and through special events and tournaments. Our business model doesn't depend on selling packs; instead, it depends on other items like pre-built decks, cosmetics, and coins. Our in-game market will enable you to buy and sell cards to and from other players. A tradable card is a card that you can sell on the market or buy from other players.To make cards from a pack tradable, you must spend a coin while opening that pack. Then these cards can be traded on the market. If you choose not to spend a coin and to open the pack for free, the cards you get will be untradable, and can’t be sold.Tradable and untradable cards play the same; the only difference is that you can't sell untradable cards. The drop rate of cards doesn't change; either you used a coin, or you didn’t.If you're a free player, don't worry! You can still go Free Forever and open all your packs for free. If you love our game, the least we can do is to let you enjoy it as much as you want!The open beta is scheduled for May 2020 on PC only and will be free to play.

Our system allows users to see their opponent and their opponent's dartboard simultaneously due to our novel use of data streaming technologies and user interface options.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Long story short, this platform will act as the world’s largest arena. Challenge anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world for a game, from the comfort of your home or from your favorite pub, requiring only a laptop, an external webcam, internet and an account on our platform.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/W5NcRMBFlY8isZyNDs/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Users get to stick with their real dartboard  and preferred darts while DartsManiacs covers the broadcast and all the rest.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">If both players are DartsManiacs users, starting a game can be done as fast and as easy as 3 mouse clicks. Travel time now becomes more playing time, and expenses become congratulatory drinks.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Play more in a fast and simple way. More games mean more experience.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Practice becomes interactive while playing with old friends or new ones, wherever they are. Meet new people  and build communities.  Anything can start with a game of darts. :)</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This is a brief introduction into what we have experienced so far with DartsManiacs, however, there is much more to come.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">DartsManiacs is currently under development, but we hope our ideas have sparked your interest to join us in building something extraordinary.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We, the developers, would like to have the chance of taking this project further. We would like to implement all the features we have planned and want to make this the go-to place for all darts players.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p><h2 style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></h2><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">One of  our biggest goals is to find all the people who are as excited as us about this project. We want to make sure we are building the right product for them.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We brought DartsManiacs as far as we could with our own resources and effort. We managed so far to invest time and work into this project in our free time, outside our daily jobs.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">By holding this campaign, we hope we’ll raise funds for getting this project further in a more professional way and deliver it faster to the Darts World.  In order to make it as awesome as we want it to be, we now need to focus on this project full time. That includes bringing  full-time staff on board.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The minimum founding target will allow us to have a full time team which will bring into the stage a Beta version and afterwards a fully functional product which will act as the largest darts arena in the world with all the necessary features for 1v1 games and 99.9% video availability.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Unfortunately, developing the platform and keeping it running in a  polished way is very expensive. All the funds raised from this campaign will go into further development and the costs of maintaining the platform (infrastructure costs – operating costs).</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We  are a small group of people who managed, in about two years, with our own resources to bring this project so far. With this campaign, we would like to raise funds to finalize the first stage of this project and take it  to the next level.  Our goal is  to find people who share our enthusiasm and want to be part of the movement.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586534149/wsilexm30whd0iarxjql.png"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""margin-left:40px;""> </h2><h2 style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>DartsManiacs vision</strong></h2><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This idea came out of passion for Darts and technology from a few senior software developers and an amateur darts  player. We were wishing to make the distances disappear in the world of darts and give users  an opportunity to play more, despite geographical constraints. DartsManiacs is the product of our combined efforts on weeknight evenings and weekends.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We started asking ourselves, what if we could create a highly performant web platform which will break the distance barriers enabling players to play anyone else, across any distance, from any place with a dartboard, only requiring web cameras and internet connection?</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">What if you could play a game  and enjoy the real venue feel from your office, your home or your favorite pub with someone from another country or continent?  Where else can users play with friends, or develop new friendships based on their love of the game?</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">What if we could build a go-to place for any darts player offering great features, which will transform this platform into the biggest darts arena ever?</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We have the answer to the first part of the question: yes, we have proven to ourselves that we can build it. The second part of the question is related to you, the darts players. We are very enthusiastic about the project, but the final purpose of it is to serve and to complete the Darts World,  for the Darts players.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">What if a few developers create an Indiegogo campaign asking for support from people who  share their enthusiasm while working  to make the product available to everyone. What if we would find those enthusiastic people to help us accelerate the development and make it available for everyone faster?</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We are here at the final step, if you like our idea and would like to be a part of it, we could really use your help to make it happen. Don’t get me wrong, it will still happen, but not that fast. If the goal of the campaign will be reached, we will be able to launch a beta version in about 3 months, maybe even faster. We will use the funds to help our developers focus full time on the project, not just part-time, which will speed things up a lot.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Once this project reaches a stable operational level, our wish is to invest back into grass root darts by offering support to darts players and darts events all over the world.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p><h2 style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>DartsManiacs features</strong></h2><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We wanted to create the world’s largest darts arena.  With our own resources, we have managed to build and to bring to the forefront a first version which for now supports 1v1 X01 Darts games with 2 video streams for each player.  Players are currently able to:</p><ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">See the opponent and the opponent's Dartboard at all times. Using two webcams at the same time for each player creates a real venue feel.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Perform a quick system setup: point one webcam to your throwing position (if you have a laptop this will be the laptop’s webcam), fix the second webcam at the dartboard’s level (maybe with a tripod), create an account on our platform and off you go ! You're ready to have fun.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">You can setup your webcams position before starting the game or during the match </li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Find and add your friends who already use the platform</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Choose your opponents (friends or filter online users on their averages, location);</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Play anyone in the world.</li>

 What is DartsManiacs?DartsManiacs  is a web platform enabling anyone to instantly play darts with anyone else in the world while offering a real venue feel.How is this possible? Our system allows users to see their opponent and their opponent's dartboard simultaneously due to our novel use of data streaming technologies and user interface options.Long story short, this platform will act as the world’s largest arena. Challenge anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world for a game, from the comfort of your home or from your favorite pub, requiring only a laptop, an external webcam, internet and an account on our platform.Users get to stick with their real dartboard  and preferred darts while DartsManiacs covers the broadcast and all the rest.If both players are DartsManiacs users, starting a game can be done as fast and as easy as 3 mouse clicks. Travel time now becomes more playing time, and expenses become congratulatory drinks.Play more in a fast and simple way. More games mean more experience.Practice becomes interactive while playing with old friends or new ones, wherever they are. Meet new people  and build communities.  Anything can start with a game of darts. :)This is a brief introduction into what we have experienced so far with DartsManiacs, however, there is much more to come.DartsManiacs is currently under development, but we hope our ideas have sparked your interest to join us in building something extraordinary.We, the developers, would like to have the chance of taking this project further. We would like to implement all the features we have planned and want to make this the go-to place for all darts players. Why Indiegogo?One of  our biggest goals is to find all the people who are as excited as us about this project. We want to make sure we are building the right product for them.We brought DartsManiacs as far as we could with our own resources and effort. We managed so far to invest time and work into this project in our free time, outside our daily jobs.By holding this campaign, we hope we’ll raise funds for getting this project further in a more professional way and deliver it faster to the Darts World.  In order to make it as awesome as we want it to be, we now need to focus on this project full time. That includes bringing  full-time staff on board.The minimum founding target will allow us to have a full time team which will bring into the stage a Beta version and afterwards a fully functional product which will act as the largest darts arena in the world with all the necessary features for 1v1 games and 99.9% video availability.Unfortunately, developing the platform and keeping it running in a  polished way is very expensive. All the funds raised from this campaign will go into further development and the costs of maintaining the platform (infrastructure costs – operating costs).We  are a small group of people who managed, in about two years, with our own resources to bring this project so far. With this campaign, we would like to raise funds to finalize the first stage of this project and take it  to the next level.  Our goal is  to find people who share our enthusiasm and want to be part of the movement. DartsManiacs visionThis idea came out of passion for Darts and technology from a few senior software developers and an amateur darts  player. We were wishing to make the distances disappear in the world of darts and give users  an opportunity to play more, despite geographical constraints. DartsManiacs is the product of our combined efforts on weeknight evenings and weekends.We started asking ourselves, what if we could create a highly performant web platform which will break the distance barriers enabling players to play anyone else, across any distance, from any place with a dartboard, only requiring web cameras and internet connection?What if you could play a game  and enjoy the real venue feel from your office, your home or your favorite pub with someone from another country or continent?  Where else can users play with friends, or develop new friendships based on their love of the game?What if we could build a go-to place for any darts player offering great features, which will transform this platform into the biggest darts arena ever?We have the answer to the first part of the question: yes, we have proven to ourselves that we can build it. The second part of the question is related to you, the darts players. We are very enthusiastic about the project, but the final purpose of it is to serve and to complete the Darts World,  for the Darts players.What if a few developers create an Indiegogo campaign asking for support from people who  share their enthusiasm while working  to make the product available to everyone. What if we would find those enthusiastic people to help us accelerate the development and make it available for everyone faster?We are here at the final step, if you like our idea and would like to be a part of it, we could really use your help to make it happen. Don’t get me wrong, it will still happen, but not that fast. If the goal of the campaign will be reached, we will be able to launch a beta version in about 3 months, maybe even faster. We will use the funds to help our developers focus full time on the project, not just part-time, which will speed things up a lot.Once this project reaches a stable operational level, our wish is to invest back into grass root darts by offering support to darts players and darts events all over the world. DartsManiacs featuresWe wanted to create the world’s largest darts arena.  With our own resources, we have managed to build and to bring to the forefront a first version which for now supports 1v1 X01 Darts games with 2 video streams for each player.  Players are currently able to:
See the opponent and the opponent's Dartboard at all times. Using two webcams at the same time for each player creates a real venue feel.
Perform a quick system setup: point one webcam to your throwing position (if you have a laptop this will be the laptop’s webcam), fix the second webcam at the dartboard’s level (maybe with a tripod), create an account on our platform and off you go ! You're ready to have fun.
You can setup your webcams position before starting the game or during the match 
Find and add your friends who already use the platform
Choose your opponents (friends or filter online users on their averages, location);
Play anyone in the world.
Everything is built focused on getting into a match as fast as possible. 
2 game modes -  Statistics ON ( game statistics will be recorded by the platform for that game) - Statistics OFF ( game statistics will not be recorded by the platform for that game, useful for your warm up matches. 
  Get into a Match with 3 mouse clicks. More matches, more practice  Easy match configuration 
Predictive score pad to prevent entering erroneous scores. If you still made a mistake and entered the wrong score, do not worry, you can still edit it, but we will notify your opponent about that.
No time to finish the match with your friend? No problem. Leave the match open until the next time you can play. We will keep the match exactly at the point where you left it (legs and score).  That is very useful if you refresh the page by mistake or if your internet or electricity goes off. It also happened to us during the development.  But now, no worries, we've got your back ☺

A computer with internet connection. Use only Google Chrome or Opera as your web browser!
A suitable internet connection will support watching a YouTube video.
A player account on our website.
Two web cameras: one of them will be pointing at the dartboard and the other at your throwing position. If using a laptop, one of the two cameras can be the laptop's integrated camera. A mechanism that will keep the second webcam steady, pointing at the dartboard. We recommend a tripod.
P.S. we recommend  having two webcams for the best experience on our platform, but it works just fine with one camera also ;)  Technical specificationsWe won’t bore you with much technical stuff, but based on the platform requirements (to be fast, and scalable for millions of users, video availability close to 100%, no down time to the site during further development and to be also user friendly) we had to create an architecture capable to sustain everything in the most robust way. To achieve that, we used the latest and the most flexible technologies which complied with the software architecture requirements.Because we want our platform to offer the features enlisted before to every player in the world we have to use a cloud server system for the application and a third party global media server service. The media server will ensure the big rate of video availability but these come with serious costs. Future plans for this projectWe have long term plans in our mind for this project. Like we have already said, we want to build the go-to place for any darts player. Having that in mind, if our campaign is successful, we will be able to launch in a short period of time a fully 1v1 functionality.Afterwards, we will focus on building leagues and championships and lots of surprising features  surrounding that. ☺Next, we will be approaching team vs. team functionality.

<p></p></div>","Pillow Fight is the prime release of a multiplayer first person shooter in real life!Nothing before came this close to a true FPS.Our goal is to transfer the experience of modern first person shooters directly into the real world. With great high-tech electronics and for a price that everybody can afford!As we don't want anybody to shoot each other with real bullets, we use the latest hi-tech infrared-laser system. Harmless to the eyes, yet with great accuracy. This allows us to give every weapon its own specifications.These will be the first two guns available:Also all our guns will be packed with everything needed to make them look and feel incredibly realistic:To make sure that every hit counts, we are using hit-indicating combat-vests which will include head-sensors for accurate skill shots.These vests not only look good but alert you, that you have been hit via sound, light and vibration, built into the vest. Also, this allows you to see that you successfully hit an enemy player, by the LEDs on their vest and of course by the sound you will hear from the speakers within your vest.What we really need to achieve the true FPS-experience using a Heads Up Display (HUD) for every player.For the HUD we came up with the most clear and simple solution:We use your smartphone!Regardless what smartphone and operating system you use (iOS, Android, WindowsPhone) you will be able to play Pillow Fight, as we are developing a universal app for everybody. And of course the download will be for free!So our App will not only pair your guns and your equipment, but also give you the possibility to use every feature you are familiar with from state-of-the-art multiplayer shooter games.As you can see, we designed a one-size-fits-all wristband which not only gives you the freedom to have your HUD always available, but also protects your smartphone with a display protection which still allows you to navigate the app.If you know how a multiplayer first person shooter works, you already know how Pillow Fight will work!Depending on the game mode you are playing, you will be able to fight against each other, or team up with friends to kick some enemy team's butts.So... it's basically the same as playing your multiplayer shooter games on your console or your pc, but in this case you are running around in the real world, with your guns and equipment, showing your true aiming and team-player skills.Every player has their setup:One or two guns, the vest, the headband, the wristband and a smartphone (required!) running the Pillow Fight appYou will be able to pair your gear with your app. This allows you to define different player-classes and also your gear to only work with your respective Gamer-ID.We then thought about what game-modes you, as gamers, might like to play.So, we are happy to confirm the following game-modes will be available in Pillow Fight right from the start:
Deathmatch
Team-Deathmatch
Multi Team-Deathmatch
Domination
Duel

Mexican Standoff

That is just the beginning. We can't wait to hear your suggestions for new game modes!One of your biggest concerns surely is: ""Will I always have people to play with?""We thought about this question a lot and we found some great solutions, by making it easy as 123 and to make sure you will always find Pillow Fighters nearby:Think of Pillow Fight not only as a game, think of it as a new kind of sports. You could even form an association!As we love pimping our guns to the maximum, as much as you do, we clearly decided to give you the possibility to put attachments onto your guns. Our first three attachments will be available at the time of the launch, if we reach the specific Stretch Goals. Remember, these are only the first attachments, we want to produce. There will be much more great stuff to put onto your guns. As well, since you are an important part of the team, you will be able to tell us what you want us to develop.The Red Dot Sight helps you to improve your aiming. It will be fully adjustable, so it will be up to you on what distance you will calibrate it.If you want your gun to make less noise and don't want to appear on the enemy radar, you might want to use the silencer.The Grip lowers the recoil effect of you gun, specially while using assault rifles with a huge recoil, this attachment is really helpful.We designed every attachment to fit onto every weapon. In this way, you will have the freedom to customize your guns fitting with your preferred method of play.The connections we will use, will be all standardized so you will not only be able to let the gun know which attachment you put on, but also supply attachments like the red dot sight or the tactical light with energy.We were not lying when we told you that Pillow Fight will have every feature you are already familiar with in modern multiplayer shooters. This means that the players progress is a very important feature of the gameplay as well.We divided the progress into two parts.As we want Pillow Fight to evolve and improve over many years, it makes no sense to give players experience points to level up in ranks. What we created instead are what we call Experience Coins (XC). With these Coins you will be able to purchase Player Items and unlock KillStreaks. However, this will be just the beginning. Once the Pillow Fight Community (PFC) grows large enough we will offer more and more ways to spend your XC. We want the PFC to be a very important part of the development, so that you will be able to share your ideas on this topic also.Every successful action in the game will give you XC. Here are just some of the many ways to earn XC:In order to unlock Weapon Extras which will improve your guns, you have to earn Experience Points (XP) with the respective gun. You can earn XP in a similar way to XC. Some examples:Note that there are more to follow!With your XC you are able to purchase Player Items. Some of them will have a specific count of usages per match. Once you have decided to use a Player Item in a match it is spent.Here are some of the Player Items, that will be available at the launch:While your gun is earning XP, you will level it up rank by rank. Every new rank unlocks a new Weapon Extra, which you are then able to choose for your gun.Here are some of the Weapon Extras, that will be available at launch:If you manage to eliminate several enemies in a row, you will get a KillStreak. You are already familiar with this type of gameplay!In order to be able to choose which KillStreaks you want to take with you in a match, you have to unlock them with your XC.Here are some of the KillStreaks which will be available at the launch:In our teaser trailer we told you that the whole world will be your map. So you might want to know, how that will work, don't you?Whenever you set up a game lobby with your friends, you are able to draw borders to create a map out of the place you are currently located in:You can even select the Respawn-Positions:There will be many other options, so please stay tuned.After creating a map... you can name it, select different criteria (like ""dangerous at night"") AND even save it.In this way you can use this map each and every time you return at this location, without having to fill out all the details again.And most importantly: On the Pillow Fight homepage, you can see every map created. This is done so you can find out where in your area there may be maps to play on, which were found by other playersThere, you will be able to rate maps, discuss them or even suggest improvements.We want Pillow Fight to be a great way to get deeper into the FPS-experience, but we also want it to be a completely new and fun activity. As you know, not everybody likes people are playing first person shooters.So we decided to show a small difference, large enough to be not mistaken, but small enough to deliver the right feeling for the player. To protect the hi-tech electronics which are inside each product, we will be using a carbon-like plastic skeleton. This skeleton will then be further protected by hard foam material.The outer surface will be made of a smooth plush (soft fur-like) with unique and trademarked stylish patterns along with stark black embroidery-style stitching for our comic-like outlines.If anybody is asking you: ""Why you are running around with soft toy weapons?"", you are always able to say: „We are just having a little Pillow Fight.“ Smart, hey!!?  You might want to know if there are any differences between playing a first person shooter on your pc or console OR in real life with Pillow Fight.We'd love to show you those differences: As you can see, you will not only have great fun with Pillow Fight, but you will also be doing something for your health. You never expected that from a first person shooter, did you?First of all, you should know that all rewards will reach you one month before the product officially hits the stores. So there is a lot of time to level up before the rest of the world does. Important: Every reward includes worldwide shipping!To make this even better, we decided to give all Indiegogo Backers one month of double XP for their guns!So here are the rewards:You will get access to the Pillow Fight Community (PFC) homepage as soon as it is online, so you can save your Gamer-ID and edit your profile way before everybody else is able to do so. This reward is included in every other reward!This sweet pillow looks exactly like its functional brother, but is only stuffed with foam. You can play around with it, throw it around and hug the rounds out of it!The ""Sidearm"" Starter Kit includes our first sidearm PLUS the vest (incl. headband) AND the wristband. Everything you need to get yourself right into combat.The ""Assault"" Starter Kit includes our first assault rifle PLUS the vest (incl. headband) AND the wristband. Everything you need to get yourself right into combat.The ""One Man Army"" Starter Kit includes our first assault rifle AND sidearm PLUS the vest (incl. headband) AND the wristband. With this Starter Kit you are able to switch guns instead of reloading. A great advantage for serious players.The Two Man Army reward includes 2 ""One Man Army"" Starter Kits.To show your friendship a little love, both of you will get the player item ""Helpful Hand"" three times and unlock the KillStreak ""Backup"" immediately.The ""Limited Edition One Man Army"" Starter Kit includes our first assault rifle AND sidearm PLUS the vest (incl. headband) AND the wristband.In this special edition you will receive a limited edition standard assault rifle and sidearm. Both will be coming to you in a unique design, which will be made exclusively for our Indiegogo campaign, with real gold threads and velvet instead of plush. These guns will be each limited to a total of 99 items, all numbered.The Clan Pack includes six ""One Man Army"" Starter Kits.To show you that we support clans right from the beginning, you will get them at this special price. Also you will get the chance to register your clan-name and clan-tag throughout the early access to the Pillow Fight website.Time to get famous! If you choose to take this reward, you can send us a picture of your face, which will be illustrated by our graphic designer Ralf Bremer and put on every package of all Pillow Fight Starter Kits. An option for you is to tell us if tell us, if you want us to put your Gamer-ID under your picture.You will also get a Limited Edition ""One Man Army"" Starter Kit.You will get the chance to meet the crazy guys behind Pillow Fight and party with them all night! It's all on us! (including travel and accommodation)We are planning on having the Pillow Fight Launch Party in May 2014 in Atlanta, GA. You will also get a Limited Edition ""One Man Army"" Starter Kit. Bring it with you and the team will sign it for you!For those of you who want us to bring even more stuff onto the market, right from the beginning, here are our Stretch Goals.Note: All of these items will be available as rewards as soon as their Stretch Goals are reached!If we reach this goal, we will design and develop this, a perfect place to secure your sidearm. So when you are reaching to change weapons, you don't have to put them into your pockets.

If you would like to have the standard assault rifle in you ""Assault"" or ""One Man Army"" Starter Kit, that's fine too.We told you that we want you to team up in clans. However, what really proves how well a clan plays together is via a great tournament, where all of you can boast how much you got. We are planning to arrange a huge tournament, where clans are able to fight for real prizes, but we are also going to build a real life replica of your favorite map from a video game (decided by majority vote).

<p>Arcane Worlds is a remake / re-imagining of the classic <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Carpet_%28video_game%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Magic Carpet</a> game. It's a first person shooter, but instead of running you fly, and instead of guns you have an array of spells which are powerful enough to change the game world beyond recognition.</p>
<p>To use those spells, especially the more powerful ones, you need mana which is gathered from the world and stored in your castle. Enemy creatures and sorcerers will try to hamper the gathering and claim the mana for themselves, so there are some tactics involved too.</p>
<p>And to get new spells you'll explore multiple worlds, solve some puzzles and discover the stories of various people after the Dark Tide Calamity which happened several centuries ago. You'll be able to affect those people, helping or harming them, making choices that will define your story, goals and the ending of the game.</p>

<p>The demo has a small universe and less spells than the current alpha, but it'll give you a fairly good idea of what the game is now and how it runs on your computer.</p>

<h2>Already in alpha<br/>
</h2>
<p>
<b>Dynamic worlds</b> - The magic is powerful and you can use it to 
reshape the worlds, building or destroying, placing volcanoes and 
chasms,  guard towers and walls, raising islands out of the sea and 
more.</p>
<p><b>Water and lava simulation</b> - Create and redirect streams. Raise volcanoes or stop lava flows. Drain water to discover what's hidden beneath it. Breach a mountain lake to flood a town. Use all that and more to reach your goals or just for fun.</p>
<p><b>Swarms of creatures</b> - Massive battles with powerful spells. Summon armies or fight those summoned by your adversaries. Fight the remnants of the Dark Tide. (Note: no ""summon an army"" spell in alpha for now.)</p>
<p><b>Procedurally generated content</b> - While a lot of the stories, worlds and gameplay elements are designed and scripted, the exact way they appear in the game is generated semi-randomly each time you start a new game. So the universe will be different on each play-through, and you will encounter things you never saw before.</p>
<h2>Will be in complete game</h2>
<p><b>Multi-player</b> - While not yet in alpha, several multi-player modes
 will be added later. Both co-op and PvP, but limited to all players 
being in one world at a time. The story mode will be single-player only.</p>
<p><b>Huge boss enemies</b> - Mighty Dark Abominations will be procedurally generated by the game, essentially assembling them from a large variety of parts. You'll need special tactics and sometimes certain spells to defeat them. They will travel between worlds, like you do, and change them.</p>
<p><b>Dynamic universe in story mode</b> - There are many worlds to explore and you can choose the way you do it. As you progress, various events will happen in the universe, triggered by you or other wizards, consequences of your actions or clashing of other characters.</p>
<p><b>Rune magic</b> - Multi-part spells which require you to put the runes on the ground, arranged in the right pattern. That'll allow you to carefully place and time the effect of the spell. Some of the patterns will channel very powerful magic. Some will allow you to do things not possible otherwise. Some will change the way you play if you choose to use them regularly and will eventually bring you to a specific ending. And you can experiment by changing the runes you use in the pattern to discover new magics.</p>
<p><b>Sandbox mode</b> - Experiment with magic without any limitations. Share the worlds you create.</p>
<p><b>Modding support</b> - Using the same tools the story mode is created with, make your own stories, or add various elements to the game, like creatures, places, world features, puzzles and more. Steam Workshop support will be added for mods.</p>
<p><b>Linux and Mac ports</b> - The game is Windows-only for now, but I'd like to port it to Linux and Mac too. Of course, you'll get those versions for free if you already own the game, just like other updates.</p>

<p>My name is Alexey Volynskov, and I make almost everything in Arcane Worlds, except music and some sounds.</p>
<p>I was a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_director"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">technical director</a> and co-founder of <a href=""http://gaijinent.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gaijin Entertainment</a>. I did a lot of stuff, designed and developed several major versions of the in-house engine, and contributed to many projects in various ways. A lot of my work went into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Blades"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">X-Blades</a>. But because of the health issues, I sold my share and left the company.<br/></p>
<p>I was still recovering when I started working on Arcane Worlds in 2011, and it went really slow at first. I'm fine now, I moved to Bulgaria where the climate and the food are much better for my health. The game was Greenlit, and while I ran out of my savings, Steam sales allowed me to work on Arcane Worlds full-time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/907585/files/20141006053449-why-igg.png?1412598889"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Early Access sales are quite low now, and not enough to fund the development up to the release. I can get a part-time job to pay the bills, but that'll seriously slow down the development, and I'll have to cut a lot from the game too.</p>
<p>Getting funding from a publisher or an investor is an option too, but crowd-funding is better since it's less limiting creatively, so I'd like to try IndieGoGo first.<br/></p>
<p>I won't abandon Arcane Worlds, even if the IndieGoGo campaign won't reach its goal. I really want to create a Magic Carpet remake and expand on it, and I owe it to the people who already trusted me by purchasing the game on Early Access. So here I am, asking for your help to let me finish the game, and hopefully, make it great.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/870151/files/20140920065252-where-money.png?1411221172"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The amount I'm asking for is the minimum to finish the game. It'll be smaller than I'd like it to be, I'll have to cut corners and add some less significant features post-release, but it'll be a complete game with a story and several endings.</p>
<p>Most of the money, after taxes and campaign-related expenses, will go to paying my bills (rent, food etc.) while I work on the game for about a year. I already have the software to make the game, so there's no need to purchase anything else.<br/></p>

<p>If I get more than I'm asking for, I'll expand the game, so it'll take longer to finish, but it'll be much better. I might also do some features (like multi-player and Linux/Mac ports) earlier.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/870145/files/20140920064742-rewards.png?1411220862"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Each tier includes the rewards from all previous tiers. Note that some tiers have multiple rewards.<br/></p>
<h2>The game</h2>
<p>You'll get an unique download link on my site which you'll be able to use to download the current alpha and all future updates, up to and including the release. Also, on the same page there'll be Steam and Desura keys you can use if you prefer to get the game on those portals.<br/></p>
<h2>Your name in credits</h2>
<p>Your name will be added to the special section of the game credits. I'll contact you to ask what name you'd like to use for that.<br/></p>
<h2>Soundtrack</h2>
<p>On game release (when all music will be made, polished etc.) you'll get a high-quality digital copy of the soundtrack. Both in lossless high-quality FLAC and more commonly-used MP3 formats.<br/></p>
<h2>Name something in the game universe</h2>
<p>The game universe is procedurally generated each time you start a new game. Things that have names like, for example, towns will have dedicated name pools from which the names will be randomly selected. So any particular name isn't guaranteed to appear for you when you start a new game, but eventually it will, and many people who play the game will see it too.</p>
<p>Please keep the names appropriate. It's a (mostly) fantasy-themed game, so not all names will fit. I'm sure we'll be able to work it out together.<br/></p>
<p>Let's take a look at what you can name if you choose the appropriate perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>A town.</b> There'll be various settlements in the game, some flourishing, some long abandoned and in ruins, and they'll have names: written on stones, mentioned by characters and used in stories to discover as you play.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>A tribe or nation.</b> Some savages might be unnamed, but more advanced tribes and civilized nations will have names. You'll be able to interact with them in various ways, and they'll drive stories. Some ancient nations will be long gone, leaving only ruins filled with their writing and secrets.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>A ""boss"" creature.</b> There'll be huge weird powerful Dark creatures called <b>Abominations</b>. They won't talk, but tribes which encountered them will name them and tell you about them.  Another option is <b>Dark Titans</b>, the old wizards who merged with the Dark Tide, either trying to deal with it, or seeking power for themselves. They'll be similar to Abominations, huge Dark creatures but with some human-like elements, and they'll talk to you, and will be involved in some stories.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>A wizard.</b> If you select this perk, in addition to the one of the above, you'll be able to name a wizard character. The same pool of names rule apply, so the name might not appear in every play-through. But the wizard characters are more unique, you'll encounter them many times in different worlds and they might become your allies or enemies. In addition to the name, you can specify some personal traits for the wizard - I'll consider them when adding that wizard to the game, but I don't guarantee to follow them exactly.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Design a new spell, creature or world</h2>
<p>You can choose one thing to design, and be as specific (or not) with your idea as you wish. I'll talk to you to figure out what you want and implement it in the game. For example, you can say ""I want a fiery tornado spell"", or ""I want a creature like that mythical one (link to the picture)"". Or you can describe it in more details: how it should work, how it should interact with other stuff in the game - it's up to you.</p>
<p>Note that I might adjust it so it fits in the game and is not under- or overpowered. The thing you designed will be in each generated universe, but might be missed in any particular play-through if the player skips some worlds, for example.<br/></p>
<p>Your name and the thing you designed will be put into the special section of the game credits, separate from the others.</p>
<p>You can choose one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>A spell.</b> It'll be subject to the common game mechanics in the matter of discovering or making it and casting it, but you can design what it does and name it. Note that it might be used by NPC wizards too, against the player or someone else.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>A creature.</b> It can be an enemy, a peaceful critter, or something else. You can design how it looks, how it behaves etc. You can also specify if you want players to use it as a mana gatherer or not.</li>
<li>
<b>A world.</b> This one is more tricky. It can be just some unique-looking world. Or it can be a world with some kind of puzzle. Or it can be a small story, as long as it takes place in one world. It's up to you.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sponsor tier</h2>
<p>Your name will appear as ""sponsored by"" when the game starts, before the title screen / main menu, as well as in the similar separate section in the game credits.</p>
<p>You can choose one of the following rewards: request a major feature or design a story.<br/></p>
<h3>Request a major feature</h3>
<p>Any reasonably big feature you want to see in the game. I'll discuss it with you in detail. Note that some things might not be possible because of technical limitations (performance mostly) or too big for me to implement. I'm sure we'll be able to work out something for you.<br/></p>
<p>Note that I also won't add features to the core game that change it too much from what I want it to be, but I might add them as optional mods / DLC. So if you really want to make the game into a sailing simulator or shaman dancing rhythm game, I can make that as a separate download-able content.<br/></p>
<h3>Design a story</h3>
<p>As an alternative, you can design a fairly big story, involving multiple worlds, characters and nations. It'll be in every generated universe and it'll be really hard to miss if you complete the game. You can design it in detail or just tell me to ""make a story about this and that"", it's up to you.</p>
<p>Again, if I feel it changes the game too much from what I want it to be, I might release it as an optional DLC instead of adding it to the core game.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/872199/files/20140921114922-risks.png?1411325362"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p>The usual risk of game development is running out of time/money while not getting the project to the completion. I'm going to implement critical features first: buildings and towns, humanoids, AI, rune magic and Abominations. Then I'll make a simple story using that stuff to find out how much time it takes me to create one. I'll then scale the size of the story mode depending on how much time/money I still have.</p>
<p>I'll need some extra money for Linux and Mac ports, to buy BASS licenses and a Mac to build and test the game on, as well as to cover the development time. If I only get the amount I'm asking for, I'm going to do that post-release, using the sales income.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the campaign will attract more attention to Arcane Worlds, resulting in more sales on Early Access. That'll help to alleviate the risks, but I'm not counting on it.<br/></p>
<ul></ul>

<p>Spread the word about the campaign, both online and offline. You can use the links at the top of the page, below the video to easily share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus.</p>
<p>Play the demo and tell people what you think. Getting the word out is just as important as the contributions themselves, and I really appreciate all the help I can get.<br/></p>

Please keep the names appropriate. It's a (mostly) fantasy-themed game, so not all names will fit. I'm sure we'll be able to work it out together.
Let's take a look at what you can name if you choose the appropriate perks:


A town. There'll be various settlements in the game, some flourishing, some long abandoned and in ruins, and they'll have names: written on stones, mentioned by characters and used in stories to discover as you play.


A tribe or nation. Some savages might be unnamed, but more advanced tribes and civilized nations will have names. You'll be able to interact with them in various ways, and they'll drive stories. Some ancient nations will be long gone, leaving only ruins filled with their writing and secrets.


A ""boss"" creature. There'll be huge weird powerful Dark creatures called Abominations. They won't talk, but tribes which encountered them will name them and tell you about them.  Another option is Dark Titans, the old wizards who merged with the Dark Tide, either trying to deal with it, or seeking power for themselves. They'll be similar to Abominations, huge Dark creatures but with some human-like elements, and they'll talk to you, and will be involved in some stories.


A wizard. If you select this perk, in addition to the one of the above, you'll be able to name a wizard character. The same pool of names rule apply, so the name might not appear in every play-through. But the wizard characters are more unique, you'll encounter them many times in different worlds and they might become your allies or enemies. In addition to the name, you can specify some personal traits for the wizard - I'll consider them when adding that wizard to the game, but I don't guarantee to follow them exactly.


Design a new spell, creature or world
You can choose one thing to design, and be as specific (or not) with your idea as you wish. I'll talk to you to figure out what you want and implement it in the game. For example, you can say ""I want a fiery tornado spell"", or ""I want a creature like that mythical one (link to the picture)"". Or you can describe it in more details: how it should work, how it should interact with other stuff in the game - it's up to you.
Note that I might adjust it so it fits in the game and is not under- or overpowered. The thing you designed will be in each generated universe, but might be missed in any particular play-through if the player skips some worlds, for example.
Your name and the thing you designed will be put into the special section of the game credits, separate from the others.
You can choose one of these:


A spell. It'll be subject to the common game mechanics in the matter of discovering or making it and casting it, but you can design what it does and name it. Note that it might be used by NPC wizards too, against the player or someone else.


A creature. It can be an enemy, a peaceful critter, or something else. You can design how it looks, how it behaves etc. You can also specify if you want players to use it as a mana gatherer or not.

A world. This one is more tricky. It can be just some unique-looking world. Or it can be a world with some kind of puzzle. Or it can be a small story, as long as it takes place in one world. It's up to you.


Sponsor tier
Your name will appear as ""sponsored by"" when the game starts, before the title screen / main menu, as well as in the similar separate section in the game credits.
You can choose one of the following rewards: request a major feature or design a story.
Request a major feature
Any reasonably big feature you want to see in the game. I'll discuss it with you in detail. Note that some things might not be possible because of technical limitations (performance mostly) or too big for me to implement. I'm sure we'll be able to work out something for you.
Note that I also won't add features to the core game that change it too much from what I want it to be, but I might add them as optional mods / DLC. So if you really want to make the game into a sailing simulator or shaman dancing rhythm game, I can make that as a separate download-able content.
Design a story
As an alternative, you can design a fairly big story, involving multiple worlds, characters and nations. It'll be in every generated universe and it'll be really hard to miss if you complete the game. You can design it in detail or just tell me to ""make a story about this and that"", it's up to you.
Again, if I feel it changes the game too much from what I want it to be, I might release it as an optional DLC instead of adding it to the core game.


The usual risk of game development is running out of time/money while not getting the project to the completion. I'm going to implement critical features first: buildings and towns, humanoids, AI, rune magic and Abominations. Then I'll make a simple story using that stuff to find out how much time it takes me to create one. I'll then scale the size of the story mode depending on how much time/money I still have.
I'll need some extra money for Linux and Mac ports, to buy BASS licenses and a Mac to build and test the game on, as well as to cover the development time. If I only get the amount I'm asking for, I'm going to do that post-release, using the sales income.
Hopefully, the campaign will attract more attention to Arcane Worlds, resulting in more sales on Early Access. That'll help to alleviate the risks, but I'm not counting on it.



Spread the word about the campaign, both online and offline. You can use the links at the top of the page, below the video to easily share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus.
Play the demo and tell people what you think. Getting the word out is just as important as the contributions themselves, and I really appreciate all the help I can get.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

Paul
Miller: An
entrepreneur and nationally touring performing artist, Paul brings creativity
and enthusiasm to every project he tackles. His early career experiences in the
hospitality industry and street performing where unhappy customers could just
walk away taught him that connecting with your audience is at the core of
customer service. He went on to create Flow Circus, a successful education
company promoting active learning and play through the juggling arts. In 2013,
Paul co-founded Skoyz Wellness to provide companies with a tool to increase
productivity by making individuals, teams, and organizations stronger.

Dawn Daria: An award
winning educator and author, Dawn loves to inspire individuals to step out of
their comfort zone in order to discover something new about themselves, each
other, and the world. Her natural ability to assess group dynamics and
facilitate collaboration has been critical to her success as a teacher,
educational consultant, and curriculum developer. She has taught a variety of
skills to a wide-range of ages, but her favorite has to be working with teens.
They are primed for risk-taking and self-discovery, but at the same time their
fresh perspective on the world has much to teach adults. In 2013, Dawn
co-founded Skoyz Wellness to utilize her knowledge of learning, motivation,
leadership, and teamwork to engage individuals, strengthen teams, and enhance
organizational culture.


Our
thanks:
We want to

Someone raised something to my attention.<br/>To put it bluntly: that there is no gameplay in the video.<br/>There actually is. Confused? Let me explain.<br/><br/>Imagine a painting. A beautiful painting. Now, please imagine you take a step, and then another... And you walk in. Into the painting. Literally. The middle part of the trailer - is the gameplay. But without animations and interface (sorry, I need to make them soon, but at the same time - I am so busy with the Greenlight and the IndieGoGo and they are not rolling as good as I hoped they will :( ).<br/><br/>The bottomline is - THAT is the game. Those are not fancy wallpapers or artworks. What you see here is what you will see - inside. As a player. Imagine if the whole world... Would be a painting. But a painting that is alive. Its not static. It lives, moves, breathe. And you are inside. In the world, on the other side of canvas. Aaand well - practically everything tries to kill you :D After all - this IS a horror game.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432303427/v3hqi3rjw6ggeeh8axtf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432670230/hse5njh3mwhpitu8e4lh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432670273/g7bsjkkhhwrurfxo7e4g.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div style=""text-align: center;"">

    Dear players and Steamers. Someone raised something to my attention.To put it bluntly: that there is no gameplay in the video.There actually is. Confused? Let me explain.Imagine a painting. A beautiful painting. Now, please imagine you take a step, and then another... And you walk in. Into the painting. Literally. The middle part of the trailer - is the gameplay. But without animations and interface (sorry, I need to make them soon, but at the same time - I am so busy with the Greenlight and the IndieGoGo and they are not rolling as good as I hoped they will :( ).The bottomline is - THAT is the game. Those are not fancy wallpapers or artworks. What you see here is what you will see - inside. As a player. Imagine if the whole world... Would be a painting. But a painting that is alive. Its not static. It lives, moves, breathe. And you are inside. In the world, on the other side of canvas. Aaand well - practically everything tries to kill you :D After all - this IS a horror game.

~DOWNLOAD LINK~  Imagine Alice in Wonderland and Silent Hill hooked up and had a baby. And then the baby got adopted by Lovecraft and raised on the board of Event Horizon during its virgin flight. Antumbra 2 is that child.  Antumbra 2, as its prequel is a very surreal point-and-click horror adventure game. It has a powerful storyline, immersing audio, surreal graphics and atmosphere thick and sticky like tar. 
Its an adventure game like nothing else, taking inspiration from things like Silent Hill, Darkseed, Event Horizon, Lovecraft, H.R. Giger, Zdzislaw Beksinski, Hellraiser, David Firth animations, Alice in Wonderland, Planescape: Torment and many many others. 
The idea is to make Antumbra 2 to be for Antumbra 1 what Half Life 2 was for Half Life 1 - to take everything what was great in the prequel and expand it, polish it, add new extensions, and basically to make it bigger, better and more badass. 
Antumbra 2 is an attempt to bring back from the grave the Adventure/Point and Click genre which over the years degraded into Hidden Object Games with difficulty setting locked on kindergarten level.

PLATFORMS:-Windows , Linux and Mac. (Desktops)-Android & iOS (IF Stretched goals reached)  

Antumbra takes place directly after the first part. After Eskalion awaking. Eskalion is weak and lost most of his powers. His realm, Sorma'Ksul is being ruled by his darken half, which makes the land twisted, corrupted and surreal. 
Player is forced to help Eskalion regain his power and rule. Which is more of a need rather then choice, because Player is trapped in the Sorma'Ksul and cannot go back to reality. Eskalion promised, that once he regains his powers he would the Player go back to his homedimension.

 NONE! :D Surprised? Well let me explain... But please, read it all. I know, we all hate walls of text, but this one's important.

Unfortunately, I couldn't come up with anything cool and flashy while still being just me - an indie developer. So here's what I've come up with.Every penny counts. For the initial 3000 $ I will develop A2 the size of A1. And that's it. That's the spine, the backbone. But its a tiny percentage of what I would WISH to make. More locations, characters, riddles, stories, dialogs, inventory system, runic magic system, combat system, player familiar/companion, full voice-over, better graphics, animations, nonlinear elements that changes with each playthrough, many endings, random encounters, replayable content and much more. The list is big.My friends, I find it very hard for me to take anything from the list and just glue it to an exact stretch goal. Like ""6000 $ - voice over."" Because the voice over will be there anyway; the size of it though depends on how successful my IGG campaign will be. I cannot say ""$9000 - 100 locations"", because this is just a silly number. Think The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. Who gives a damn how big the gameworld is, if its damn dead, empty and repeatable...? It's all about polishing and putting more ""meat on the bones"". The more money I have the more features I can add.Because I do everything myself (graphic design, animations, music, voice over, sfx, code) it's hard to put a price tag on it. Because I am doing the work of at least 6 people. So should give myself 6 independent salaries...? I don't think so.That being said, I am ready to make something amazing - I ""just"" need your support! 
Because it is being request. And in my whole life there was not a request i wanted to fulfil more then this one. 
Because Love Is A Two-Way, Mutual Thing.
Although my game is dark and unforgiving, the story of this campaign is pretty simple; full of love and appreciation. Antumbra was my first proper game in the genre of horror adventure published for free on Newgrounds, GameJolt and Kongregate platforms.
After the initial release you, the community of the Internet, gave me an incredible, unimaginable amount of love and constructive feedback. I was truly humbled by your response.
It was so unexpectedly well-received that by popular demand it is time for a bigger, better & story-expanding sequel - Antumbra 2: Chant of Dust!

 

Antumbra 2: Chant of Ash is going to be a deep, personal experience for every player just like Antumbra 1 was. That being said, although I'm expecting to finish this game 6 months from the successfully funded campaign the release date might be slightly delayed.

I am a self-learner. I taught myself everything I know.  Raging from English language, graphics, music, audio, to coding, design, animation and whatnot.I am a weird-music composer, game designer, voice actor, graphics artist, a coder. Also quite a loony.

 
Antumbra 2: Chant of Ash is made by me and myself only and is my personal dreams-come-true type of story. Antumbra 1 was made as my personal cry for help. 
At the time I was working on the game I was dealing with a lot of personal stuff in my life and making this game was the best thing that's ever happened to me, Now, after hundreds of e-mails and questions on multiple websites asking me for Antumbra 2, I am ready! 
Antumbra 2: Chant of Ash is going to be everything Antumbra 1 was and much much more. It's about my life and my pain, but at the same time it's about yours too.
 

Some people can't contribute to the campaign directly, but that doesn't mean they can't help!
Please spread the word around and make some noise about my campaign. Thank you kindly!

<h4>Story</h4>
<p>
Flybros takes place in the early 1900s, and like many gentlemen in their era, the two brothers dream of being the first men to take flight. The brothers are blessed with talent, however talent alone is not satisfying enough. They want to be known as inventors. But since the brothers are unsuccessful at growing fine mustaches, they aren’t accepted by the inventor community, unrecognized as true gentlemen, and thus never taken seriously as inventors.  
<br/>
</p>
<p>
However, on one fateful day the brothers discovered a vessel of shampoo that fell from the sky, which read: “May all your dreams and wishes come true.” Little did they know that this odd looking bottle would alter their fate forever.

<h3>Groom</h3>
<p>In Flybros, we created a unique level up system. You do not gain experience from fighting or flying. Instead you level up by grooming your mustache. Some of the hair products you collect can be used to groom. Why? Because your mustache will evolve, of course!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>So let us fly with GRACE and POWER!</b></p>

Our inaugural project, Miramonte Park, is a make-believe playground designed to bring out the best of both digital and real-world play for boys and girls ages 3-to-6. We intertwine digital learning games, which adults appreciate, free-play, which children love, and stories and real-world play in one single app.

Our <b>playground</b> is <b>imaginary</b>, and our <b>storybooks</b> are <b>physical</b> and <b>digital</b>.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We found that many parents do not want to read eBooks with their child but want to participate in their child’s digital worlds.  Our stories are written to be enjoyed by adults and children, and our interactive digital books offer children a unique window into the world.

We’ve created <b>characters based</b> off the <b>five elements</b>:  earth, air, fire, water, and space, and have <b>animal characters</b> that are <b>equals</b> in our world.  Our goal is to celebrate our place in nature. We want to acknowledge the <b>magic</b> of all of the <b>elements</b> but also <b>help children understand</b> what we know about <b>nature</b>, and <b>how it works</b>. For example, we illustrate the lifecycle of a plant, how snow forms, and why fire is hot.

Our company, Last of Five, is focused on creating learning games, and  we believe
<b>narrative</b> is the <b>fundamental form</b> of <b>human learning</b>. We have made stories the heart of our world, so that the narratives and characters can create a <b>whimsical</b> and <b>fantastical space</b> for your child to imagine, play, and learn. We want children to be fully <b>engaged</b> with our <b>world</b>. By beginning with the storybook, we are creating a strong narrative that <b>doesn’t sacrifice story</b> for <b>gameplay</b>.
</p>
<p>
The second reason we’re starting with story is more personal
– as game designers, <b>we think</b> the most <b>compelling games</b> <b>have narrative</b>.  More broadly speaking, you can reduce the game design process to one of two basic approaches — you can start by creating a narrative — who the characters are, why they are doing what they are doing — or you can start by designing the game mechanics — the actions characters take such as jumping, flying, and things like that. By starting with narrative, we can be more creative with gameplay. And the <b>more creative</b> <b>we can be</b> as designers, the <b>more creative our players will be</b> when playing our games.</p>

<b>that</b> is the <b>mythological way</b> of being an <b>individual</b>. We are
all Montees, and that is what will make the park magical.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our stories <b>redefine archetypes</b>, <b>challenge stereotypes</b>, <b>support</b> <b>individuality</b>, and give children the <b>freedom to imagine</b>. We intentionally mix up our color palette and do things like make the fire character purple. We emphasize that our differences can <b>help us better understand</b> our world.

<b>Your world seems very
ambitious in scope and you have a lot going on (arts, games, learning, stories);
how are you managing all these ideas?</b>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<p>We are focusing on one piece at a time!  We agree it’s an ambitious project, and we are making Miramonte Park because learning is playing, and playing is learning. We want to share
our interests with children to inspire them to take on challenges.</p>
<p><b>Are you going to have
boy characters?</b></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p>We will create boy characters when the time is right. We
would love to stay with the elemental theme of characters, and have boy
characters be inspired by naturally occurring elements such as neon, helium,
and titanium.</p>
<p><b>Your game seems
feminine, is it a game for girls?</b></p>
<p>Our game is designed for all children.  Some aspects of our world will be feminine, others masculine,
and the rest somewhere in-between.  We
spent most of this past summer play-testing our game, and both boys and girls
liked the game equally well. It was
interesting to me, but frankly not surprising given my background building
games and my access to learning and gaming research that neither the boys nor
girls play-testing Miramonte Park really
noticed the strong female presence in the game, and those that did notice did
not seem to mind.</p>
<p>So, what turns out to be interesting, and potentially a
challenge, is that adults — who buy these games for children — quickly and
independently note character gender in Miramonte Park. This is not a game design issue per se in terms
of enjoyability and playability, but this is something I have seen before — it
is a marketing and presentation issue to parents, the economic buyer, rather
than the kids.</p>
<p>We've thought about it deeply at Last of
Five. It is puzzling that adults do not question whether the <i>Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> game is a world exclusively for boys because of
its strong male presence!</p>
<p>Lastly, I think boys need strong female characters in games
and books just as much as girls do, and
taking different perspectives and gameplay strategies into account while
designing yields better games. So we make games for everyone.</p>
<p><b>Why don’t you show
any children in your videos/images?</b></p>
<p>We want Miramonte Park to speak for itself.  We want you to imagine being part of this
world, and decide if you like it.  We are
frustrated by a lot of the marketing that is directed toward children these
days, and we do not want to be influenced by these tactics where children are
used as propaganda to sell products.</p>
<p><b>What is your game
design process?</b></p>
<p>By starting with the story, we are able to set ourselves up
for success.  We will decide where the
digital learning games and real-world activities will go as we write the
story.  If we need to modify the story to
accommodate a learning activity, we can. 
After the story is set, we can dive deeper into creating the learning
games and real-world activities.  We will
create the real-world activities first to keep children engaged with our world
as we develop the digital games.  This
process will also give children the freedom to play and imagine and make up
their own games before they play ours. 
We will then create each digital game and publish them as we complete
them.  </p>
<p><b>Why is it called
Miramonte Park?</b></p>
<p>My most important “ah-ha” moment after I started
designing Miramonte Park was its name. You see, Miramonte Park
is named after a real place; it’s the park I grew up next to.  I knew if I named it that, it would remind
me to stay true to my roots and keep the intrinsic motivation of why
we’re doing this project alive.</p>

</div>
</div></div>","I am Tina Ziemek, and I started Last of Five, LLC to create children’s play that is balanced, sincere, and promotes unity in a world where play is disproportionate, artificial, and promotes division. Our inaugural project, Miramonte Park, is a make-believe playground designed to bring out the best of both digital and real-world play for boys and girls ages 3-to-6. We intertwine digital learning games, which adults appreciate, free-play, which children love, and stories and real-world play in one single app. 


Our playground is imaginary, and our storybooks are physical and digital.  We found that many parents do not want to read eBooks with their child but want to participate in their child’s digital worlds.  Our stories are written to be enjoyed by adults and children, and our interactive digital books offer children a unique window into the world.




We’ve created characters based off the five elements:  earth, air, fire, water, and space, and have animal characters that are equals in our world.  Our goal is to celebrate our place in nature. We want to acknowledge the magic of all of the elements but also help children understand what we know about nature, and how it works. For example, we illustrate the lifecycle of a plant, how snow forms, and why fire is hot.

The main characters are based off of the five elements (from left to right): water, earth, space, fire, and air.  The story follows the space character named Violet.



The digital storybooks have learning games for when your children want to play on their own.  These games allow children to practice a wide range of learning concepts including literacy skills, spatial skills, and empathy.   Literacy develops self-image and provides a foundation for all other learning.  Spatial ability lends itself to creativity and is correlated with success in various scientific and engineering disciplines.  Empathy increases happiness, problem solving abilities, and courage. 


In our first story, Alfie (the cat-like animal), has magic seeds that he offers Violet so she can plant them and make a wish.  In the digital storybook, your child grows the plant by picking the correct seed, and giving it dirt, water, and sun.  The child will see his or her plant throughout the story and will use it at the end of the story.  Parents may be happy to know the magic seeds are not the solution to solving Violet’s problem.  Instead, persistence, ingenuity, and teamwork save the day.

Our goal is to give an object at the completion of each learning game and turn these objects into toys your child can use in the playground's sandbox. For example, in the growing plants' game, your child will get a shovel that can be used for digging in the sandbox. 

We will also provide ideas for real-world, hands-on activities that tie into the story and complement the digital games. These activities will emphasize free play and will turn household objects into playtime tools. Below is a paper-based activity we did at a local farmer's market where children designed their own flowers.  Parents loved seeing their child's creative process, the flower their child made, and how each flower was unique to their child.


In another activity, we built terrariums so children could
watch real plants grow over time and recognize everything doesn’t happen as
quickly as it does in Miramonte Park.  We encourage making the terrarium out of a large spaghetti sauce jar or similar
object to emphasize the importance of reuse and recycling.



There is no shortage of apps available for children, but there is a shortage of high-quality learning apps.  You can think of playing like eating, and
buying toys like buying food. Many apps are sugary and
salty bite-sized snacks. We have found these apps are primarily used to keep kids busy here and
there.

Miramonte Park is the organic alternative and complete solution because we give children a rainbow of colors,
stories, activities, games, and opportunities for free play and learning.  We believe true, genuine play gives children the opportunity to learn on their own terms, grow their imagination,
and be their true selves.

Our goal is to make screen time meaningful.  We aim to be the center of a wide range of learning, where your child can make discoveries, and feel that learning is fun. We understand that you need Miramonte Park to help in times
when your child is sick, unable to play outside, when you’re traveling, and
when your child is begging to play on the iPad.  




Our company, Last of Five, is focused on creating learning games, and  we believe

Montee is derived from the Spanish word ""monte""
for mountain.  As Joseph Campbell noted, you are the central
mountain, I am the central mountain, we are all the central mountain, and
that is the mythological way of being an individual. We are
all Montees, and that is what will make the park magical.

Our stories redefine archetypes, challenge stereotypes, support individuality, and give children the freedom to imagine. We intentionally mix up our color palette and do things like make the fire character purple. We emphasize that our differences can help us better understand our world. And our story follows our Space character, Violet, as she figures out what is unique about herself and that Montees are more similar than different.

We are focusing on one piece at a time!  We agree it’s an ambitious project, and we are making Miramonte Park because learning is playing, and playing is learning. We want to share
our interests with children to inspire them to take on challenges.
Are you going to have
boy characters?


We will create boy characters when the time is right. We
would love to stay with the elemental theme of characters, and have boy
characters be inspired by naturally occurring elements such as neon, helium,
and titanium.
Your game seems
feminine, is it a game for girls?
Our game is designed for all children.  Some aspects of our world will be feminine, others masculine,
and the rest somewhere in-between.  We
spent most of this past summer play-testing our game, and both boys and girls
liked the game equally well. It was
interesting to me, but frankly not surprising given my background building
games and my access to learning and gaming research that neither the boys nor
girls play-testing Miramonte Park really
noticed the strong female presence in the game, and those that did notice did
not seem to mind.
So, what turns out to be interesting, and potentially a
challenge, is that adults — who buy these games for children — quickly and
independently note character gender in Miramonte Park. This is not a game design issue per se in terms
of enjoyability and playability, but this is something I have seen before — it
is a marketing and presentation issue to parents, the economic buyer, rather
than the kids.
We've thought about it deeply at Last of
Five. It is puzzling that adults do not question whether the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles game is a world exclusively for boys because of
its strong male presence!
Lastly, I think boys need strong female characters in games
and books just as much as girls do, and
taking different perspectives and gameplay strategies into account while
designing yields better games. So we make games for everyone.
Why don’t you show
any children in your videos/images?
We want Miramonte Park to speak for itself.  We want you to imagine being part of this
world, and decide if you like it.  We are
frustrated by a lot of the marketing that is directed toward children these
days, and we do not want to be influenced by these tactics where children are
used as propaganda to sell products.
What is your game
design process?
By starting with the story, we are able to set ourselves up
for success.  We will decide where the
digital learning games and real-world activities will go as we write the
story.  If we need to modify the story to
accommodate a learning activity, we can. 
After the story is set, we can dive deeper into creating the learning
games and real-world activities.  We will
create the real-world activities first to keep children engaged with our world
as we develop the digital games.  This
process will also give children the freedom to play and imagine and make up
their own games before they play ours. 
We will then create each digital game and publish them as we complete
them.  
Why is it called
Miramonte Park?
My most important “ah-ha” moment after I started
designing Miramonte Park was its name. You see, Miramonte Park
is named after a real place; it’s the park I grew up next to.  I knew if I named it that, it would remind
me to stay true to my roots and keep the intrinsic motivation of why
we’re doing this project alive.",22.0,1,"2 Campaigns

You drive RC cars against other players and AIs. Ours is an action-packed game where you are not only fighting to be the first, but also to survive.</p><p>Collect coins to buy better and faster cars. Find gadgets to trick your opponents. Compete in beautiful handcrafted levels. Master drifting and become the best RC Racer.</p><p>No point being the fastest if you can’t make it to the finish line.</p><p> </p><h2>ABOUT RAVENSTONE STUDIO</h2><h2> </h2><p>It all started at the end of August, 2020. We had been talking about this for ages, the same recurrent discussion: how come some AAA games are visually astounding but some seem lifeless at the same time, no matter the genre or their storyline? Most of the time, it all comes down to “what we would have changed to make it better” if it were up to us. </p><p>We feel games are automatised, almost clockwork reproductions. If games were created as a coherent whole by people who know each other and share a vision, things would be very different. We want to make this a trend and exalt true artistic freedom. We want to take risks… to create worlds... we want our games to represent our <i>selves</i>. For us, risk is the foundation of art… and art is the foundation of fun.</p><p>That’s why we, Mauro Fuentes and Diego Gomez, decided to take action and found Ravenstone at the end of August, 2020. We are a brand new independent game development studio with members in Seattle (US), Granada (Spain) and Buenos Aires (Argentina): in other words, a multicultural and diverse group. Our aim is to be trend-setters instead of just sticking to the current mainstream video game industry. That is, to be a breath of fresh air for the gaming community.</p><p>We are excited to present our first official video game: RC Racer.</p><p> </p><h2>WHY HELP RAVENSTONE?</h2><p> </p><p>Paraphrasing agent Smith:<i> It is purpose that created us. Purpose that connects us. Purpose that pulls us. That guides us. That drives us. It is purpose that defines us. Purpose that binds us. We are here because of you, Mr Player.</i></p><p> </p><p>Like Smith, we have this strong sense of purpose. Our friendship brought us together and made us colleagues, but there is a much higher purpose: a professional one. The only game worth playing is a fully developed one. </p><p> </p><p>A video game is only a game if it’s playable.<br/> </p><p>If you decide to help Ravenstone take off, you will be enabling a small young team to consolidate and grow, not only in terms of business but also from the point of view of personal fulfilment. You will give us the chance to do what we love. </p><p> </p><p>Give us your support so that we can properly finish this video game. In the long term, your support will allow us to create more titles and offer the gaming community handcrafted original material. </p><p> </p><p>Give us your support so more artists, programmers and designers can come work with us. It’s a virtuous circle.</p><p>Why help us? In only 4 months we’ve achieved this. Imagine what we will achieve in more time and with your support.</p><p> </p><h2>CURRENT FEATURES</h2><p>Cool features that are already working:</p><ul>

You drive RC cars against other players and AIs. Ours is an action-packed game where you are not only fighting to be the first, but also to survive.Collect coins to buy better and faster cars. Find gadgets to trick your opponents. Compete in beautiful handcrafted levels. Master drifting and become the best RC Racer.No point being the fastest if you can’t make it to the finish line. ABOUT RAVENSTONE STUDIO It all started at the end of August, 2020. We had been talking about this for ages, the same recurrent discussion: how come some AAA games are visually astounding but some seem lifeless at the same time, no matter the genre or their storyline? Most of the time, it all comes down to “what we would have changed to make it better” if it were up to us. We feel games are automatised, almost clockwork reproductions. If games were created as a coherent whole by people who know each other and share a vision, things would be very different. We want to make this a trend and exalt true artistic freedom. We want to take risks… to create worlds... we want our games to represent our selves. For us, risk is the foundation of art… and art is the foundation of fun.That’s why we, Mauro Fuentes and Diego Gomez, decided to take action and found Ravenstone at the end of August, 2020. We are a brand new independent game development studio with members in Seattle (US), Granada (Spain) and Buenos Aires (Argentina): in other words, a multicultural and diverse group. Our aim is to be trend-setters instead of just sticking to the current mainstream video game industry. That is, to be a breath of fresh air for the gaming community.We are excited to present our first official video game: RC Racer. WHY HELP RAVENSTONE? Paraphrasing agent Smith: It is purpose that created us. Purpose that connects us. Purpose that pulls us. That guides us. That drives us. It is purpose that defines us. Purpose that binds us. We are here because of you, Mr Player. Like Smith, we have this strong sense of purpose. Our friendship brought us together and made us colleagues, but there is a much higher purpose: a professional one. The only game worth playing is a fully developed one.  A video game is only a game if it’s playable. If you decide to help Ravenstone take off, you will be enabling a small young team to consolidate and grow, not only in terms of business but also from the point of view of personal fulfilment. You will give us the chance to do what we love.  Give us your support so that we can properly finish this video game. In the long term, your support will allow us to create more titles and offer the gaming community handcrafted original material.  Give us your support so more artists, programmers and designers can come work with us. It’s a virtuous circle.Why help us? In only 4 months we’ve achieved this. Imagine what we will achieve in more time and with your support. CURRENT FEATURESCool features that are already working:
Video game infrastructure code basis. Most of the infrastructure for this phase is already coded. On this basis, we can easily expand the system in a modular way
Career mode in alpha stage
Versus mode in alpha stage
Your garage to select cars
A simple automatic save system
4 stunning and unique low poly scenarios
6 frantic one-of-a-kind racing cars
Fuzzy decision-making AI (not completely based on predefined paths)
Weapons to trick or harm opponents
Traps to sabotage other racers (careful: they can turn against you)
Collectible coins to buy more cars
Mind-blowing drift system.
Stats for each car
 WHAT WE NEED THE FUNDS FOR We need around $16,000 to complete the first phase of the development and give you a solid offline version of RC Racer with Career and VS (against P2) modes. We need to recoup part of our initial investment in order to reinvest in the game. To ensure stability within Ravenstone, we will pay competitive salaries to all our staff.With the help of a UI artist, a concept artist, a 3D artist, a full-time programmer and a copywriter, we will improve the current game state. The full-time programmer will be helping us wrap up or enhance the features the game already has and set up the foundations for the online and other modes. We need time for artists to turn prototypes into final state assets and polish up the current tracks.We’ll invest part of the funds to further promote the game on social networks. We’ll also hire a beta-tester in order to start testing as soon as possible.By the end of this period, we’ll have a stable beta version of the game with the characteristics mentioned above and the following features:
Versus mode in beta stage
Career mode in beta stage
Test-drive level
Improved UI functionality
More cars
Secret paths in all tracks
Easter eggs

<h3>Space Fight</h3>
<p>Spacefight is a science fiction RTS. Players build buildings just like in a conventional RTS but units are automated. The idea is to reduce micro-management and make it a slower paced game where you consider your moves thoughtfully before committing resources to them. There are elements of tower defence to the gameplay, but it is much deeper than that. Players build a base including resource production,  unit production and defensive buildings. The units fly off and fight with each other and attempt to destroy the enemy base.</p>
<p>It is designed for both single and multiplayer, and will be released for Mac, Windows and as a browser game. The browser version lacks multiplayer due to browser security settings.</p>
<p><strong>The Prototype</strong></p>
<p>This is a playable prototype I have already made, and I want funding to finish it. Below is a link to the page where you can download the game or play it in your browser:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.gametheatre.org/cms/tiki-index.php?page=Welcome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.gametheatre.org/cms/tiki-index.php?page=Welcome</a></p>
<p>The gameplay is fairly repetitive at the moment, bear in mind the prototype is just for demonstration purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>
<p>There are many features planned which will make the game exciting, competitive and unique. One of the most important of these will be a system of damage/armour types, which will provide a sort of ""rock/paper/scissors"" quality to the gameplay. You might think you have an unstoppable army off laser wielding ships, only to find your opponent has installed special reflective armour that bounce lasers off without flinching. So you refit all your ships to carry missiles and projectile weapons that will shatter the brittle armour easily. A second feature that will change the combat dynamic a lot will be the addition of simulated aiming calculations. Instead of all your shots automatically hitting the server will calculate the relative trajectories, velocities and accuracy of ships and weapons so that it will no longer be possible to drop bombs on interceptors. In addition to that the AI algorithms of ships are going to be upgraded, so that they no longer simply make for the closest target and blindly chase it. This will be done by giving the AI a javascript based scripting interface, based on the Jurassic interpreter.  This will allow me as a developer to quickly program interesting and unique behaviour modes for each ship type, and in addition to this will allow those players who wish to, to customise these scripts or even write their own meaning you will not be able to easily predict how your enemies' ships will behave. </p>

<p>I am trying to establish myself as an independent game designer, through working on my own game ideas and distributing them for free. I have a large number of ideas, many of them quite ambitious. For me it is all about gameplay and innovation, not money, but it is hard to get by without any support at all. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>I am not comfortable with the way copyright law currently works, I believe people should get paid for their time and effort. If this project is funded I will spend the money paying myself minimum wage to work on finishing and polishing this project. I may spend some of the money hiring other people to help me, especially with art assets, but the bottom line is every dollar will translate to a measurable amount of work done on the game. I am also using a fixed funding model for this project so if it doesn't get fully funded no one will pay me anything. Success in this project will enable me to continue on bringing quality free content for all into the future.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even more important than funding, I need a supportive community. Play my games, post on the forums on my website, offer suggestions and encouragement.

<p>The story is about a young man who values women's beauty and especially the beauty of women's underwear. He is a jack of all trades and knows thousands of ways to get into the house of beautiful girl. It's not easy to find panties because decent girls don't store them in conspicuous places and wouldn't a strangers to take their underwear... unless they like him.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Many people think that this game is about a pervert but it's not. This story isn't about panties but about people. You communicate with a girl, try to solve her problems, reveal character traits and learn something new about characters including the protagonist. In a process you open additional scenes telling about the past of the girls, drama in their life, funny situations and relationships. The main goal of the game is to give the player a funtime, jokes, pranks and unexpected moments. We are interested in the idea of getting into a women's apartment, seeing this girl's life from the inside and getting acquainted with women's problems.

<p>All our projects are inspired by <i><strong>the retro style of old movies and anime. </strong></i>We very carefully approached the realization of this style. We had to explore a lot of different processing techniques, learned the principles of programming etc. In the future we plan to develop this style to make it better and better. But it's not only the style that we like. The era itself is very inspiring for us. It seems like those times were filled with something joyous, light and carefree. As if people had stronger feelings and love. They fought for love and happiness аnd certainly found that. Our game is supposed to give you this wonderful feeling of pure and undisturbed romance and to dip you into this beautiful nostalgic era.</p>

<p>Hi! We're <i><strong>two young people</strong></i> united by the love for unusual atmospheric and beautiful games. We also share love for anime and films from the 80's - 90's. We've just begun our journey with an easy, pleasant and sweet project. This project is our first attempt. With your support we'll be able to use our full potential!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are nameless people, we don't yet have pages in social networks (but we're planning).<br/><strong>I am</strong> the organizer of this project, the game design, the author of the idea and part of the script, music.<br/><strong>And  artist</strong> - the creator of a magical atmosphere, design. </p>

<p>Creating games is <i><strong>our dream</strong></i>. Quite recently we thought it might be impossible. We've been stuck in our boring jobs, but there was always a glimmer of light and hope in us! And now we're close to achieve our first goal. We found out about Indiegogo and thought it's an excellent platform for our start. We chose <strong><i>""FIXED FUNDING"" </i></strong>because we trust you and believe in our project. Making games is much harder than we thought it would be. It wasn't easy to realize our project without money but despite all the difficulties, we've developed a demo version. 60% of the graphics and the script is ready. And now you can help us achieve our final goal. We've put a lot of energy into the game. It's our pass into the bright world of videogames. Yes, we are newbies, but we believe in our talents and hope for your support!</p>

But it's not only the style that we like. The era itself is very inspiring for us. It seems like those times were filled with something joyous, light and carefree. As if people had stronger feelings and love. They fought for love and happiness аnd certainly found that. Our game is supposed to give you this wonderful feeling of pure and undisturbed romance and to dip you into this beautiful nostalgic era.

Hi! We're two young people united by the love for unusual atmospheric and beautiful games. We also share love for anime and films from the 80's - 90's. We've just begun our journey with an easy, pleasant and sweet project. This project is our first attempt. With your support we'll be able to use our full potential!
Unfortunately, we are nameless people, we don't yet have pages in social networks (but we're planning).I am the organizer of this project, the game design, the author of the idea and part of the script, music.And  artist - the creator of a magical atmosphere, design. 
 

Creating games is our dream. Quite recently we thought it might be impossible. We've been stuck in our boring jobs, but there was always a glimmer of light and hope in us! And now we're close to achieve our first goal. We found out about Indiegogo and thought it's an excellent platform for our start. We chose ""FIXED FUNDING"" because we trust you and believe in our project. Making games is much harder than we thought it would be. It wasn't easy to realize our project without money but despite all the difficulties, we've developed a demo version. 60% of the graphics and the script is ready. And now you can help us achieve our final goal. We've put a lot of energy into the game. It's our pass into the bright world of videogames. Yes, we are newbies, but we believe in our talents and hope for your support!
 


 

Working in a team isn't easy. It's very difficult to find reliable people. We replaced five programmers who contributed to the project and the result was a mess in the Unity-project, but fortunately everything worked out. We put so much effort and money in this project that there is a zero chance that this game won't come out. But without the required amount of money, the development might slow down. We plan to release the game at best in summer at worst in fall. Your support will allow us to quit our jobs and focus on the development of wonderful games.
You can also support us using PayPal. Be sure to note down the price of the perk you want!PAYPAL.ME

With Northward we want to create a co-op experience that we feel is missing on the market. Management games are often a very solitary experience and we want to change that! Planning your next move, optimizing your shared resources and having to handle catastrophic events is something we believe is a lot more fun when shared with a friend.<br/>   We're planning to develop the multiplayer through Steam and thereby we are targeting <b>Steam as our only platform</b>. We need your help to get greenlit!<br/><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>Pre-alpha demo</b><br/></p><p>With the pre-alpha demo we want to let you get your hands on the game right away and experience the basics of the gameplay
by playing through a short scenario. Keep in mind that the gameplay in the pre-alpha won't mirror the final 
version of Northward, as the current system is very rough around the 
edges and many features have yet to be implemented into the game. There 
will definitely be bugs and issues in the pre-alpha that won't remain at
 the time of release.<br/></p>

With Northward we want to create a co-op experience that we feel is missing on the market. Management games are often a very solitary experience and we want to change that! Planning your next move, optimizing your shared resources and having to handle catastrophic events is something we believe is a lot more fun when shared with a friend.   We're planning to develop the multiplayer through Steam and thereby we are targeting Steam as our only platform. We need your help to get greenlit!Pre-alpha demoWith the pre-alpha demo we want to let you get your hands on the game right away and experience the basics of the gameplay
by playing through a short scenario. Keep in mind that the gameplay in the pre-alpha won't mirror the final 
version of Northward, as the current system is very rough around the 
edges and many features have yet to be implemented into the game. There 
will definitely be bugs and issues in the pre-alpha that won't remain at
 the time of release.
       Download the pre-alpha for:

For Northward, the talented Shane Mesa will compose the music. Check out the preview track below!A great fog has been making its way down the mountains in the north,
devouring everything in its wake, leaving only husks of what was once
living beings. Villages swallowed by the fog have slowly turned
silent and the inhabitants have one by one left their homes,
wandering into the forest never to return.

Protected
by an ancient relic passed down through generations, your villagers
travel northward in search of the source to the corruption. As you
make your journey across the uncharted land you will encounter other
tribes, wild beasts, ancient artifacts and mysterious deities. What
fate awaits you beyond the fog?


Experience
	the online co-op campaign together with a friend.
Journey
	together into the fog and overcome the challenges that lurk within.
	Communicating, setting goals and distributing tasks amongst
	yourselves will be necessary in order to survive. Will you declare
	yourself the explorer, administrator or commander?Gather
	resources to expand your settlement.Your
	villagers are the ones that will collect and transport resources, as
	well as constructing buildings. Each worker have their own task that they
	will carry out. Making sure all inhabitants have a busy schedule is
	a cornerstone of creating an efficient village.
Cast
	spells and explore the vast Nordic landscape with your village
	elder.                                        Each
	of the players will be able to pick one of several elders to control.
	The mobility of your elder will provide you with the ability to
	scout ahead and explore the environment in order to decide where to
	go next. Should danger be imminent you will have powerful
	enchantments to rely on as you make your escape back to the village.
	Sorcery is not only for combat, but can also be used to improve
	productivity in your village with auras or other helpful spells.Defend your settlement against beings lurking in the fog.Erecting defensive structures along the front lines will ensure the safety of your villagers as they build expansions for your settlement. Always be on your guard, you never know what may emerge from the fog.Connect multiple industrial centers with transport routes.Optimizing the infrastructure of your village to grant your villagers safe and quick passage when transporting resources and creating an even flow of transport will ensure your success in each area you explore.Sacrifice
	to gain the boon of the ancient ones.

	Tribes across the land have their own respective deities they
	idolize. Some are kind to their followers, some take pleasure in
	their torment. Will you take a chance and show your devotion?Journey
	across Nordic landscapes as you unravel the secrets of the world.

	The road north will take you through grassy fields, dark forests and
	treacherous swamps as  you make your way to ascend the snowy
	mountains.Should we reach our initial funding goal, this is how the money would be distributed:

        This game is about a hero who, as fate would have it, finds himself in an abandoned castle. There will be many obstacles on his way to the treasure hidden somewhere inside, with most remarkable adversaries he will have to face and mysteries to unravel. All this to receive his well-earned reward in the end! <br/></p>

<p>The Swordbreaker gives you a rare opportunity
to find yourself in interactive fiction, where each player has their own
storyline to develop. Every action or decision will have an effect on how the
story unfolds and how it all ends. Some moves you make will change your
character's karma, and others can lead you to the darkest corners of the
castle, so be careful! Because any step you take may turn out to be the last
one!</p>

<p>On his way, the hero will encounter many
different characters and creatures that can be neutral, dangerous or friendly
towards him, as well as various objects you can use in a number of situations,
sometimes in most unusual ways. Interaction with other characters will change
the course of the story. You can either fight or make friends with them, talk
or stay away from them – the choice is yours.</p>
<span>There are more than 40 different characters in the game, so here we’re only
going to show you some of them. You will meet the rest when you start exploring
the castle.<br/>

<p>The
protagonist is a bounty hunter known by his alias as the «Swordbreaker». He
used to be a knight at the King's service but decided to resign and become a
bounty hunter. He is not averse to any work he can get his hands on, and even
looking for lost treasures. It was pure luck when once he got hold of a map
that leads to a treasury in an ancient castle…</p>

<p>In the game,
you will find illustrated scenes with captions to fill you in. Each scene will
give you several options to choose from. Any of them will have an actual effect
on how the story develops, which gives you a chance to complete the game in
many different ways. In other words, if you finish just one storyline, you will
only see one version of events. But don’t worry, you’ll have the map of the
castle with myriads of rooms to keep things straight.</p>
<p>We did
our best to improve the classic text adventures by adding some breathtaking artwork
to the game so that you can find it easier to follow the storyline and feel the
spirit of the cruel, dark castle.</p>

He had nothing left but his beloved sword, the remnants of his battered armor and an extraordinary artifact - the swordbreaker. The hero looked around and cautiously stepped onto the castle bridge...”



Main features of the game:
    

A compelling totally non-linear game story
Various endings
A huge mysterious castle
Lots of exciting locations and events
Impressive enemies and inhabitants of the castle
Absolutely stunning artwork
Achievement system


        This game is about a hero who, as fate would have it, finds himself in an abandoned castle. There will be many obstacles on his way to the treasure hidden somewhere inside, with most remarkable adversaries he will have to face and mysteries to unravel. All this to receive his well-earned reward in the end! 


The Swordbreaker gives you a rare opportunity
to find yourself in interactive fiction, where each player has their own
storyline to develop. Every action or decision will have an effect on how the
story unfolds and how it all ends. Some moves you make will change your
character's karma, and others can lead you to the darkest corners of the
castle, so be careful! Because any step you take may turn out to be the last
one!


On his way, the hero will encounter many
different characters and creatures that can be neutral, dangerous or friendly
towards him, as well as various objects you can use in a number of situations,
sometimes in most unusual ways. Interaction with other characters will change
the course of the story. You can either fight or make friends with them, talk
or stay away from them – the choice is yours.
There are more than 40 different characters in the game, so here we’re only
going to show you some of them. You will meet the rest when you start exploring
the castle.


The
protagonist is a bounty hunter known by his alias as the «Swordbreaker». He
used to be a knight at the King's service but decided to resign and become a
bounty hunter. He is not averse to any work he can get his hands on, and even
looking for lost treasures. It was pure luck when once he got hold of a map
that leads to a treasury in an ancient castle…

In the game,
you will find illustrated scenes with captions to fill you in. Each scene will
give you several options to choose from. Any of them will have an actual effect
on how the story develops, which gives you a chance to complete the game in
many different ways. In other words, if you finish just one storyline, you will
only see one version of events. But don’t worry, you’ll have the map of the
castle with myriads of rooms to keep things straight.
We did
our best to improve the classic text adventures by adding some breathtaking artwork
to the game so that you can find it easier to follow the storyline and feel the
spirit of the cruel, dark castle.



We’re
developing the Swordbreaker for
Windows, Linux and MacOS, but if we raise more money, we’ll add Android and iOS
platforms too.



Our professional artist is trying
very hard to capture every detail of the gloomy but enchanting atmosphere of
the game, so that the illustrations can convey all the adventurer’s feelings.


And this is how we
work on our illustrations:

So far, we have made considerable progress:


Script at
100%;

Artwork
at 80%;

Programming
at 20%;

The
soundtrack is ready, but we would like to re-record it, so that’s 50%.

If you’d
like to know what to expect and what the game would look like, we’ve released a
demo-version for Android OS. The game demo is in Russian and English (don’t
mind the mistakes, it will be translated again by a professional translator).
It’s short, but can still give you an idea of what the full version is going to
be like.

Why we need your help:


To
complete the artwork;

To
make the game available on various platforms;

To
create atmospheric soundtrack;

To
provide high-quality translation into other languages.

If we raise more money
than expected:


We
will add more languages;

We
will compile the game for other platforms;

<p>I am an independent game designer who is constantly thrilled
about our love for games. Ever since I played my very first game, I was obsessed.
I have always wanted to design and craft my own worlds for people to explore
and experience. Today, with crowdfunding becoming a very powerful gift in helping
people accomplish their dreams, I felt it was time for me to live mine. </p>
<p>Before crowdfunding, I really wanted to make a good quality game
that was both presentable and original. I set out to execute many of my ideas
over and over again to prove I was capable in bringing a new game to life. As a
result, Underglow was created.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b><br/></b></h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Budget</b></h2>
<p>The game is currently in its beta phase and the only thing
stopping me from getting any further are a few speed bumps. This is where I need
your help!</p>
<p>First things first is that I need more presentable artwork
for my game before I start sending it off. High quality Kingpin portraits and 3D
modeling for the buildings tiles are currently in the works, but this requires more time
and money.</p>

</div></div>","The Game
Underglow takes place in an alternate past filled with
mobsters and magic. The goal of the game is to take control of a noir themed
city with your faction and gain more reputation than your opponents.
Use different strategies to overrule the other players. Control
different colored resources to build up your forces or try your luck for bonus
rep points. Either way, the city is up for the taking.· 
Underglow will feature 9+ playable kingpins,
each with their own artwork and stats.
· 
25 beautiful hex tiles to randomly generate a different
city every time.
· 
Different colored factions for up to 6 players.
· 
Custom dice to add flavor to any match.Who am I?
I am an independent game designer who is constantly thrilled
about our love for games. Ever since I played my very first game, I was obsessed.
I have always wanted to design and craft my own worlds for people to explore
and experience. Today, with crowdfunding becoming a very powerful gift in helping
people accomplish their dreams, I felt it was time for me to live mine. 
Before crowdfunding, I really wanted to make a good quality game
that was both presentable and original. I set out to execute many of my ideas
over and over again to prove I was capable in bringing a new game to life. As a
result, Underglow was created.
Budget
The game is currently in its beta phase and the only thing
stopping me from getting any further are a few speed bumps. This is where I need
your help!
First things first is that I need more presentable artwork
for my game before I start sending it off. High quality Kingpin portraits and 3D
modeling for the buildings tiles are currently in the works, but this requires more time
and money.
Second is production costs. I will be using a website called Game Crafters to print and sell my games in order to keep my costs and fundraising goal lower. i will be doing this because lets face it, its expensive to print and sell games on your own. Here is their website if you are interested in what they do.https://www.thegamecrafter.com/Below are some works in progress that will be implemented into the game if I reach my goal.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot contribute to my project financially, but would like to help, showing this to any of your gaming friends or family would help me an incredible amount. Also, if you are in the possession of a YouTube, forum or website themed around board games, email me. I would love to talk about sending a copy for a review.

Common quests can be repeated endlessly and offer rewards between two random choices. Unique quests can be completed only once per Age. Every quest takes predefined time to complete. It ranges from 5 minutes to 23 hours. *Unique quests screen. Vigilance level is an anti-bullying system that indicates whether your champion is attacked repeatedly. Your champion can be under constant pressure of attacking players seeking your hard-earned Gold. This experience may be frustrating for some players, so we decided to implement our own system against it.Vigilance level increases every time someone attacks you. The more it increases, the less Gold they loot you next time. *You can hover over any Vigilance indicator to see current level. This level decreases looted Gold by 80 %. Every Guild can have up to 10 members. These players can donate Gold to the Guild which increases its level. Higher levels unlocks ability to construct a building. It adds slight bonuses to all Guild members. There are 9 possible buildings granting different bonuses. You can check it below:Thief Den +% looted GoldArchery Range +Attack RatingTraining Yard +Defense RatingInn +HitpointsTemple +Hitpoints regenerationTorture Chamber +StaminaBlacksmith +DamageArmory +DefenseGrinder +Critical chanceEvery clan can build only 3 buildings. You can see that it will be important to primarily try to join Guilds that add bonuses for your build or you can create your own Guild as premium player. Guild tournaments are planned as an update.*Building names are subject of change*Guild detail We want to have all players playing on one server without separating them among many different worlds. We also don't want to separate players to new and those who play for a long time. From this reason we came up with Ages. Every age will last from few to several months. By the end of the Age should be all player at max or near max level. After this period of time we will wipe all champions so all players can start again.Prolonging game for high level players bring no good, because they are not only more and more distant from new players, but they also can't start again and try something new. We want to prevent that. Although we are not some huge company that just needs to make money, we still need to have some business model for this game. We chose usual microtransaction model with slight difference. There is quite a lot of things you can buy for Premium currency from buying new races, decreasing waiting times, improving skills or sockets. However all of these bonuses are very little. Active free player will be able to beat Premium players. This game won't be pay-to-win. We chose to go with low fees that everybody can afford ranging from several cents to few dollars.Who is behind LegendaryOnes.com?Responsibility for development and all game aspects has Ing. Jan Zelinka from Czech Republic.

are only slowly starting to arrive.We have chosen a simple style of clear line and plain colors, resembling the old European comic book tradition.Characters and scenery have been
designed as a mixture of classic western cinema and our own peculiar fantasy
world.The downfall of the town can be
seen in every scenario, where rundown and abandoned buildings prevail.We are working hard on the puzzles in our effort to maintain the taste of the old adventure games, where you had to rack your brains (but without risk of explosion). The puzzles that you would gradually solve after getting stuck sometimes, but would fill you with great satisfaction at the end.We hope you enjoy them as much as we are doing creating them.These are some of the characters of the gamePantchito Chepas: He is the main character, just arrived in town and is already in jail for unknown crimes. He loves animals.Mayor: A small charlatan who rules over the town. The only thing he longs for more than gold, is the power he obtains from it. He would sell his grandmother for a gold coin.Camporedondo: This skinny and quiet guy is the town's sheriff. He wants to maintain law and order in Papadero Creek, so he will soon notice Panchito. Troll: Captured and educated in the most rude and
rough ways, this magic being guards the prison.Truhan: Born in some far away lands, this charismatic trickster will make himself a name in town, and as much business as he can with Panchito.And much more you will be able to discover in game.We are a small company from Spain made up of three friends. We are
nostalgic of old graphic adventures, and we want to create
a game
for
our families to stop looking at us with
pity
and
disgust. These are our different tasks:   -Eneko is the cartoonist
and animator.   -Charlie is the programmer.
  -Julen is the voice of reason behind the two of us. However, the three of us work
together in creating dialogues and puzzles, which we consider the pillars of
the genre.Being a small company with limited resources has made us come to the crowdfunding family. One of the reasons we are here is because crowdfunding could help us to dedicate ourselves full-time to our game.We believe we can contribute somehow to the genre, so judging if we are worth giving a try is entirely up to you.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Which is your favourite animal?“If the project gets
finally funded, we will build our particular Noe’s arch in the form of a big
drawing with all the backed animals and send a digital copy to all of you.
Those animals who are not backed will be sacrificed, could you live with it?” Thank you for all your support!",45.0,0,"1 Campaign

Play the role of a weak young gentleman who tries to achieve to become the best of all time , for this, we will have our minions , our castle (store wealth , train minions ..) and the various adventures that will live in our travels.</p><p>The project began on July 26 last year, its main objectives to achieve was to create a game in which each item was unique , offering a real "" sandbox"" , without limiting the realism of the game , as in most of the latest games ( who have been published or are forthcoming)some details are highly polished but at the same time overlook basic things : who has not wanted to grab a tank in gta and destroy some buildings ? Or playing minecraft that water arrasase everything in its path ? .</p><p>Similarly, another objective is to create a game in which the player's skill premiase , power play half an hour ( or more ) and feel it really worth the time hechado while each player could create your own class as a function of their style of play ( skills are enhanced when used, not to level up ) . All of this focused on a multiplayer game ( Coop / Vs)</p><p> The objective was achieved : With the help of Unity (Free) are designed the basic mechanics of the game , the vast majority based on procedural generation : Maps, structures , enemies, weapons , events , ia ... For the moment, only playable in Singleplayer or Coop(split-screen mode) , but in the future it will be battles against up to 32 players.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/474573/files/20140331172832-QUE_LO.png?1396312112"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p>HISTORY In BTBK there is no history so to speak ,  only the historical context in which we find (expressed in the multiple books that we find in our trip) , we make history by playing : history ( and quests events) is developed according to our actions.

These events can occur even if the player is not present, which forces our knight to explore.

Each room , depending on their size , lighting, objects / furniture inside will have a function, which we will unlock upgrades and other ... our castle</p><p>( smithy, throne room, room , torture room , stables, armory , herbalist ... ) .

To achieve this we have several methods: get experience through various actions: killing enemies, solve quests, make certain minigames, crafting, exploration ... but unlike many other games, this only serves to level up and improving our statistics (not our skills): </p><p>-Strength: Affects the damage / critical damage done with melee weapons (a bit on ranged weapons), our total strength, our (and recovery rate) endurance, armor, ability to lock and load (Force required to lift a given object). </p><p>-Dexterity: Affects damage / critical damage done with ranged weapons in movement speed, attack and velocity of release a physical ability, the probability of evasion, also the chance of critical damage (physical). </p><p>-Vitality: Influence of life (and recovery rate), the physical strength of our character and lessens the effects of disease. </p><p>-Intellect: Affects mana (and  recovery rate),magic  damage /critical, and magic resistance.</p><p>-Concentration: Influences the chance of magic critical damage, casting speed magic skill, the cooldown of all abilities and all recovery rates (life, mana, stamina). </p><p>-Perception: It influences the probability of missing a hit (because of evasion of the enemy) and critical chance (physical and magical). It also allows us to see traps / enemies and other hidden secrets. </p><p>-Charisma: Influences the price improvement and allows us to develop more dialogue choices (leading to better results in quests and events). </p><p>-Luck subtly influences everything that happens around you, such as the amount of treasures found, the doors are open, find keys or clues more easily ... </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/477689/files/20140401222958-PROGRE.png?1396416598"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p></p><p>Also is possible that some items / equipment requiring some level at least one of them(one attribute) to equip it.With each level will get 10 stat points to distribute freely, unlike other games in which the player is destined to be a particular class (with a predefined role). To prevent players have to choose which skills to use (and avoid roles), the system of gain skills is: The more you use a skill, the more powerful is, and also will allow you to use the next skill (or skills)of their skill tree. So you decide to raise skills and most importantly, allows you to upload a tree together 42 skills (6 basic) without depending on your level: teachers skilled archers experters in natura, necromancers healers, tanks murderers ...</p><p><br/></p><p>The skills tree is as follows: We have six basic trees: Magic, Fighting, Strategist, Survival ,Craft and Mysticism .. Each one contain 6 branches (counting the basic 7) which influence each the other, the tree of skills is as follows: </p><p>-Magic (Elemental): This is the most basic magic and on it are the purest spells as ""Force Field"" and ""Shockwave"". Contains: Fire, Ice, Light, Darkness, Nature and Tempo. </p><p>-Fight: It teaches different techniques and physical skills that improve our fighting technique, contains: Melee, Ranged Weapons, Guns, Battle Arts, Combat Shield and unarmed. </p><p>-Strategist: It teaches us to command our minions on the battlefield and make better buildings / war machines.contains: leadership, command abilities, war machines, battle cries, Conquistador and Architecture. </p><p>-Survival: It teaches us to survive with few resources and kill silently. It consists of: Trapper, Hunter, Explorer, Murderer, Locksmiths, Thief. </p><p>-Craft: We taught different trades: Blacksmith, Furrier, Tailor, Enchanting, Cook and Jeweler. </p><p>-Mysticism: It teaches the hidden skills and power of the ancient gods. It consists of: Faith, Blood Magic, Voodoo, Alchemy, Summoning and Necromancy. </p><p>They may seem too many skills (about 30 per tree), although it must be said that some of them will be passive, and others will be able to be combined (if allowed) on the different combos (hotkeys). Furthermore, since the only way to improve a skill (increase your level) or unlock it is using it, we won´t find  skills  that we don´t know how to use or that are useless. </p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Enemies and NPCs </b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/477690/files/20140401223106-ENEM.png?1396416666"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>In our travels and adventures we will find different NPCs. This can be enemies (the vast majority),neutral or allies. Normally neutral NPCs will not attack us as long as we do not attack them before, some are just ""enemies"" that,  due to its peaceful nature herbíbora or prefer not to fight, while others (humanoids) can be blacksmithers, sellesr or just someone with we can talk (and maybe get some quest). </p><p>On the other hand we have our allies (both own and allied knights) to help us in any way possible. We will able to hire them, capture them or raise them (animals and insects), and once this is done, we can train them so that they are stronger or more functional but unlike in other games when fighting, we can only indicate orders basic (go to a site, patrolling, wait ...) while they (depending on your level and your level strategist) will be the ones to decide which function develop in the battlefield (healer, dps, tank ... ). This also will occur with our enemies, who if they attack in groups, will choose the most useful strategy against us instead of attacking directly. </p><p>Note that while in the ""Adventure"" our maximum number of minions (NPC allies to our control) will only be 5, in the ""Castle"" the number is unlimited (focused on Castlevs Castle fight, but also oninvasions and usable in construction). </p><p>All NPCs are self-generated, depending on which ""family"" they belong, their appearance as well as their skills and stats will be different. Currently there are 4 families completed ""Humanoids"", ""Undead"", ""Beast"", ""Insects"" and 3 upcoming (""Golems"", ""Abominations"", ""Ethereal""). Broadly speaking, the differences between them are:</p><p></p><p>-Humanoids: The vast majority have a human appearance, with little or no innate abilities, but with very balanced stats, noted for its strength and intellect.

Play the role of a weak young gentleman who tries to achieve to become the best of all time , for this, we will have our minions , our castle (store wealth , train minions ..) and the various adventures that will live in our travels.The project began on July 26 last year, its main objectives to achieve was to create a game in which each item was unique , offering a real "" sandbox"" , without limiting the realism of the game , as in most of the latest games ( who have been published or are forthcoming)some details are highly polished but at the same time overlook basic things : who has not wanted to grab a tank in gta and destroy some buildings ? Or playing minecraft that water arrasase everything in its path ? .Similarly, another objective is to create a game in which the player's skill premiase , power play half an hour ( or more ) and feel it really worth the time hechado while each player could create your own class as a function of their style of play ( skills are enhanced when used, not to level up ) . All of this focused on a multiplayer game ( Coop / Vs) The objective was achieved : With the help of Unity (Free) are designed the basic mechanics of the game , the vast majority based on procedural generation : Maps, structures , enemies, weapons , events , ia ... For the moment, only playable in Singleplayer or Coop(split-screen mode) , but in the future it will be battles against up to 32 players.HISTORY In BTBK there is no history so to speak ,  only the historical context in which we find (expressed in the multiple books that we find in our trip) , we make history by playing : history ( and quests events) is developed according to our actions. This means that we are not obliged to do X quest to advance , we can pass of it, or even kill whoever gave it. Since the quest are avoidable, can kill any npc : enemy, neutral or ally without worrying about losing access to some quest later.   PHYSICS: The ""Strenght"" happens to have a greater role , since all objects satisfy the physical laws , the actions that your character can carry with them depends largely on its "" strength "" in relation to its weight : lift it , move it , ... at the same time, the weight affects the damage it causes any object ( a function of its speed), this means that if a castle crumbles us within probably die. Even our character will have a weight ( a function of your body and your inventory) making that crossing (heavily loaded) flimsy bridges  is not always a good idea.                                             CRAFTING: Most of the processes that we will make on crafting  include minigames (in which our passive skills play a major role) in order to prevent it from becoming monotonous crafting and delivering better results in function as you finish the minigame. Besides all actions associated with crafting (fishing, cooking, fur, first aid, mining ...) also count with minigames and it will give exp to us even causing us to level up regardless of  we fight or not.AUTOGENERATION: Everything is self-generated according to the level and history of the player (s)-in adventure mode, this means that we never find ourselves with 2 identical maps because on each map, will be generated new weapons , enemies, quests structures and events. Despite being still in early-alpha already has more than weapons and enemies different .COMBAT: The combat is realistic, at all times we can see our hands and feet, which allows greater fight control. We can kick in order to push or destabilizing, throwing lunges, vertical cuts and side (with edged weapons), shooting (guns, wands and bows) or use our powerful (alone or combined) skills as a combo (over 500) . All at the purest style FPS.Game modes To achieve become the best knight of all time we have 2 basic game modes: Adventure and Castillo. -Adventure: travel to a randomly generated map (4 km2), either alone or as a coop way up to 4 players (besides our minions). In these adventures we can overcome certain quests (generated and assigned before or during the adventure) and at the same time will have dynamic events. These events can occur even if the player is not present, which forces our knight to explore. Some we faced to enemies, on other we will search treasures, some have to protect someone and some evolve into a true epic, the difference to the quests, is that events are not indicated as such, making the player has to think if you do it compensates, and from which side (if you can) take part ... (each map has between 50-150 events). Also in this mode will have the help of our minions (max 6) whose we can recruiting / breeding in our castle, or capturing on the adventure. In this way we can also get the objects to  create / customize our castle or use the ""crafting"", explore or just destroy and infuriate everyone - Castle : start with a small field , but we will create a castle in the purest medieval (and mechanical) style, we can build it by hand, or ordering our minions (no limit minions in castle) that we constructed from Room Planes (made by us or purchased ) . Each room , depending on their size , lighting, objects / furniture inside will have a function, which we will unlock upgrades and other ... our castle( smithy, throne room, room , torture room , stables, armory , herbalist ... ) . Additionally we will have a lot of traps to place our castle and adjoining land (being able to build structures around the castle), and you will wonder , so many traps ? So simple, occasionally we will be attacked by other gentlemen ( IA offline or online against friends) or simply we will be harassed by a bunch of bloodthirsty monsters . Also in the case of Castillo vs Castillo ( and variants) our minions will fight on our sideProgression and Skills To achieve become the best knight of all time ,we have to improve our skills and statistics as well as our minions / castle and have the best team / wealth. To achieve this we have several methods: get experience through various actions: killing enemies, solve quests, make certain minigames, crafting, exploration ... but unlike many other games, this only serves to level up and improving our statistics (not our skills): -Strength: Affects the damage / critical damage done with melee weapons (a bit on ranged weapons), our total strength, our (and recovery rate) endurance, armor, ability to lock and load (Force required to lift a given object). -Dexterity: Affects damage / critical damage done with ranged weapons in movement speed, attack and velocity of release a physical ability, the probability of evasion, also the chance of critical damage (physical). -Vitality: Influence of life (and recovery rate), the physical strength of our character and lessens the effects of disease. -Intellect: Affects mana (and  recovery rate),magic  damage /critical, and magic resistance.-Concentration: Influences the chance of magic critical damage, casting speed magic skill, the cooldown of all abilities and all recovery rates (life, mana, stamina). -Perception: It influences the probability of missing a hit (because of evasion of the enemy) and critical chance (physical and magical). It also allows us to see traps / enemies and other hidden secrets. -Charisma: Influences the price improvement and allows us to develop more dialogue choices (leading to better results in quests and events). -Luck subtly influences everything that happens around you, such as the amount of treasures found, the doors are open, find keys or clues more easily ...  Also is possible that some items / equipment requiring some level at least one of them(one attribute) to equip it.With each level will get 10 stat points to distribute freely, unlike other games in which the player is destined to be a particular class (with a predefined role). To prevent players have to choose which skills to use (and avoid roles), the system of gain skills is: The more you use a skill, the more powerful is, and also will allow you to use the next skill (or skills)of their skill tree. So you decide to raise skills and most importantly, allows you to upload a tree together 42 skills (6 basic) without depending on your level: teachers skilled archers experters in natura, necromancers healers, tanks murderers ...The skills tree is as follows: We have six basic trees: Magic, Fighting, Strategist, Survival ,Craft and Mysticism .. Each one contain 6 branches (counting the basic 7) which influence each the other, the tree of skills is as follows: -Magic (Elemental): This is the most basic magic and on it are the purest spells as ""Force Field"" and ""Shockwave"". Contains: Fire, Ice, Light, Darkness, Nature and Tempo. -Fight: It teaches different techniques and physical skills that improve our fighting technique, contains: Melee, Ranged Weapons, Guns, Battle Arts, Combat Shield and unarmed. -Strategist: It teaches us to command our minions on the battlefield and make better buildings / war machines.contains: leadership, command abilities, war machines, battle cries, Conquistador and Architecture. -Survival: It teaches us to survive with few resources and kill silently. It consists of: Trapper, Hunter, Explorer, Murderer, Locksmiths, Thief. -Craft: We taught different trades: Blacksmith, Furrier, Tailor, Enchanting, Cook and Jeweler. -Mysticism: It teaches the hidden skills and power of the ancient gods. It consists of: Faith, Blood Magic, Voodoo, Alchemy, Summoning and Necromancy. They may seem too many skills (about 30 per tree), although it must be said that some of them will be passive, and others will be able to be combined (if allowed) on the different combos (hotkeys). Furthermore, since the only way to improve a skill (increase your level) or unlock it is using it, we won´t find  skills  that we don´t know how to use or that are useless. Enemies and NPCs In our travels and adventures we will find different NPCs. This can be enemies (the vast majority),neutral or allies. Normally neutral NPCs will not attack us as long as we do not attack them before, some are just ""enemies"" that,  due to its peaceful nature herbíbora or prefer not to fight, while others (humanoids) can be blacksmithers, sellesr or just someone with we can talk (and maybe get some quest). On the other hand we have our allies (both own and allied knights) to help us in any way possible. We will able to hire them, capture them or raise them (animals and insects), and once this is done, we can train them so that they are stronger or more functional but unlike in other games when fighting, we can only indicate orders basic (go to a site, patrolling, wait ...) while they (depending on your level and your level strategist) will be the ones to decide which function develop in the battlefield (healer, dps, tank ... ). This also will occur with our enemies, who if they attack in groups, will choose the most useful strategy against us instead of attacking directly. Note that while in the ""Adventure"" our maximum number of minions (NPC allies to our control) will only be 5, in the ""Castle"" the number is unlimited (focused on Castlevs Castle fight, but also oninvasions and usable in construction). All NPCs are self-generated, depending on which ""family"" they belong, their appearance as well as their skills and stats will be different. Currently there are 4 families completed ""Humanoids"", ""Undead"", ""Beast"", ""Insects"" and 3 upcoming (""Golems"", ""Abominations"", ""Ethereal""). Broadly speaking, the differences between them are:-Humanoids: The vast majority have a human appearance, with little or no innate abilities, but with very balanced stats, noted for its strength and intellect. Its toughness (both physical and magical) is low but it compensates with the use of armor and other weapons -Undead: Humanoids that long ago passed from this life, resurrected by a necromancer with a new and unique objective: Kill!. Represent high magic resistance and altered states, but pose low physical resistance, which makes them perfect as sorcerers. They haveinnate abilities such as breathing and rebuild. -Beasts: agile and fast, most use their mouths to make their attacks. Sometimes they can be seen using them as mounts due to its high speed and power loading, plus her meat is delicious! -Insects: Small and weak, but numerous. Although they are the easiest to kill, often with only a few hits, due to their size are the most difficult to hit, but also have been seen giant insects, real killing machines. The generation process,selects the parts that make up our NPCs, as a function of these (the number and type), it will have more or less life, attack, speed, shock resistance ... as well as certain special skill (the sting of insects allows poison, spidery legs walk the walls, the claws to dig, dragonfly wings allow flight motionless ...). Similarly, in combat, we can curtail / cut the extremites of our enemy (if a human for example) to prevent attack us, or take the legs off an insect, thus reducing its speed.. All parts of an enemy are destructible, and depending on the destroyed part will do more or less damage, plus the skill that allows that part. For example, while a humanoid can not live without a head , an undead is unfazed. With each death (even assassinate an ally) get experience and a small drop (according to the type of enemy). Also if this was carrying a gun, this will be our , which means to kill a weak enemy, but it is very strong for his equipment, always compensated.    Maps and StructuresEach map to explore is generated at play, including the terrain (holes, grooves, lakes, mountains, caves ...), vegetation (trees, shrubs and grass), natural resources (ores and minerals) enemies, structures, objects and events. Both structures and vegetation and are 100% destructible objects, plus all objects / building blocks meet the physical laws (allowing build towers, castles, bridges ..). Trees and shrubs, unless q is destroyed (for wood), bear fruit and reset after a while, so does the grass, which grows as time passes.  The structures in addition to self-generate (size, number of floors, number of rooms) also generate the content of these, making certain rooms performing functions within the structure (forging, treasure room, throne room, dungeon ...) .We can do the same things on our Castle, but if we want a specific room (bringing upgrades and improvements to our castle)  it MUST comply with different requirements (light, objects in the room, size of the room ... ). There are also other types of structures such as wells and altars (also destructible) whose function is strange and mysterious.  An important point to be destructible, is that the doors (among other things) happen to have a secondary role: if you have the key can open it, if you're strong enough uou can break or throw down, or if you have pumps you can destroy a piece of wall (being careful that it not colapse and kill you). On this moment the ground is the only part of the game that isn´t destructible or deformable, although it is one of the basic objectives, along with realistic physics of fluids (water is static moment).Weapons and Equipment In our travels and adventures we will find different types of weapons and armor, each composed and autogenerated by different parts (for the moment only generated weapons). For his generation, depending on their type (12 now): guns, bows, swords, daggers, axes, wands, staffs ...  is selected the parts that make up the selected weapon, also the material of which each part will be done and if is magic (the vast majority),the statistics modifiers for each part. Depending on the part, and the innate values ​​of the material (or alloy), the physical statistics are generated for each part, which (along with modifiers) are combined to create the ultimate weapon. This allows for example to create a sword grip and handguard which is of iron, but whose blade is diamond (using the physical strength of the iron with the hardness (damage) and low weight of the diamond). Besides exists 2000+ different  statistics modifiers (mainly affects Knight) (800 common, 600 uncommon, 400 unique and 200legendary) make each truly unique weapon. Also depending on the type of weapon equiped, enables ones or others attacks (with different multipliers to damage). Just as weapons and armor use the statics of materials (resist, weight, damage ..), so does the malleability, and each party will have a level of malleability, and if the material does not meet ( along with a help of our skill) we will be impossible ""crafting"" the part with this material, forcing us to progress our skills, find another material, or use the same material but in a less demanding part. Also can be observed in the weapon itself as wear level is used, providing a more intuitive Gun Control current state(Perfect>>50% damaged>>90% damaged):MaterialsIn our adventures we will find different materials ( 20 different ) , each with different statistics : physical resistance , repair strength , Weight , Damage , Affinity and malleability .At the same time we can divide them into 2 groups , metallic and nonmetallic , the basic difference between them is that while the latter can not be combined , the metals yes( in a forge ) , forming alloys up to 4 , and depending their proportions will alter in one way or another their stats and appearance. The various statistics that represent a material are:- Physical Resistance: The resistance of the material against another material. A material with lower strength (peak ) versus other major ( rock) , not be able to break it and reduct the level of reparation (even break )but if hit against a material with less resistance ,  it may break / damage .- Repair Resistance : The resistance of the material to be repaired , which can be translated so that cost us repair the object , weapon, armor ... in money and time.- Weight: Affects the strength to move an object , as well as the attack speed of weapons .- Damage: The base damage that causes the material on hit - Affinity: tilt of the Magic on the material (or alloy). - Workability: The ease with which the material can be molded to create an object or weapon. In the case of alloys, the resulting values ​​do not always positive, but the vast majority of the ratios will result in negative values ​​in parts (very hard material with great harm, but very heavy and not very malleable or a massive damage, but physical endurance 1, which will cause breakage in a few hits). Depending on our knowledge (and some passive skills)we will learn to create better alloys with time. To obtain these materials have to mine multiple ores (metals), minerals (diamonds and precious stones), cut trees (wood), sand melting(glass), long as we have the necessary tools, and greater physical strength than material we're going to hit.Quests and Events As we move on our journey to become the best knight,we must take out quests and events. The basic difference is that while the quests can be (mostly) performed along different maps and with a fixed bonus(exp and items) ; events only take place in the current map and are not intended to give a reward for his completion, but depending on how it develops, this will give way to new events, quests, clues ... or do not give anything (making our gentleman should consider to make it or pass). As in the rest of the game the quests and events are self-generated, allowing to divide them into several types: Quests: The quests that will take place ranging from the most basic: Rescuing a npc, farm enemies parts / kill, search treasure  to more complicated ..: Conquering a castle, fend off an invasion .. The vast majority of these will be assigned from our castle, by our minions and other emissaries, but we can also start quests from the fulfillment of events, get certain objects or complete the mission itself (in the map). Unlike other games, the missions do not disappear (unless to remove it from our search) even though we have made progress in the game, but the level of difficulty for the realization of these scale according to our knight, making that the most basic mission involves some challenge.Events : Events are like "" mini - quests "" which are not required to perform and not always occur in the presence of the player: for example, a fight between 2 teams of enemies, maybe when we come,they already been killed and the event has finalized, but if we hurry , we can take part in the fight and tip the balance of the side you want, so at the end , with a little luck the winning team will become our ally and maybe even gift us something. On this types of events are found the ""fight "", "" guard "", "" assault / conquest"" , ""defense"" or more complex types: a house is on fire , you risk turning it off ... Within this type are also more events global ( affecting the entire map) : flood, eruption , invasion ...There are other events , which can be called static , and will depend on the actions of our knight ( pick an object, initiate a mechanism to open a chest , complete a quest at any given time ) , having in most cases result in a direct confrontation with the enemy , an ambush, resolve a puzzle or a unique and unrepeatable event.Funds are needed to further develop the game  and help launch this . For now, the game has been developed by my (programer) , which means that the models and other aspects ( graphics , sound) are not created the best possible way . The funds allow you to expand the team , hiring 3d modelers , sound producers , artists ... which results in higher quality and speed when developing .It is also necessary to pay for the software , but by the time the game was developed with Unity (Free ) is required to continue to have the paid version ( $ 1,500 ) in addition to acquire other licenses ( if funds are enough) such as Cinema4D ($ 3000) or Substance Database ($ 900).

<p><img alt=""Mini Tank Battles Promo Shot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.minitankbattles.com/cji/i/promo/mtb_p3.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mini Tank Battles Promo Shot""/></p>
<h3><strong>The classes/characters</strong></h3>
<p>There are several classes you can play. At the moment there is one class available (the Tank). The others are still in production:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Tank.</strong> An overall well adapted class for combat.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Buggy.</strong> A nimble, fast moving, hard to hit class with rapid shooting weapons.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Engineer.</strong> A tower oriented class with some quite unusual weapons.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Artillery.</strong> A class specialized at destroying opponents from a long range.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Game Modes</strong></h3>
<p>There are currently 3 game modes in the alpha. The Coop mode, The Player versus Player mode and the Team versus Team mode. A 4th mode is in development: Assault mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Coop:</strong> In coop mode you and your team have to protect a certain structure against waves of enemies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Player versus Player*:</strong> Here you will fight against other players.</li>
<li>
<strong>Team versus Team*:</strong> Both teams have a structure to protect. By building towers and spawning waves you try to destroy the other team's structure.</li>
<li>
<strong>Assault:</strong> You and your team have to invade a base to destroy the enemy's structure without having a base of your own.</li>
</ul>
<p>The aim for the initial release is 5 to 10 levels per game mode. Modes with an * are multiplayer only. The others are both multi and singleplayer.</p>
<h3>Leveling/ skillpoints / gear</h3>
<p>In order to overcome bigger challenges you can level your character. By leveling you get more skillpoints that you can spend to get new and better abilities. Gear is also important. You can get better gear by drops or otherwise to become stronger.</p>
<p>There is also going to be <strong>decorative gear</strong> to personalize and spice up your vehicle.</p>
<h3>Towers</h3>
<p>There will be several towers reflecting the main weapons that are available in game as well as a few unique towers.</p>
<h3>Production platforms</h3>
<p>The game is initially released for PC, Mac and Linux. An android build is also in progress. However the android version will come after the PC, Mac and Linux versions. The iOS version will come after that (sorry for that) since I don't own a Mac or iOS device myself (which are required to create a build). Since I create the game in Unity3d, other platforms may become available, but are no part of the current plans.</p>
<p><strong>Target date for the first release is 2013Q4 to 2014Q1</strong>. This date may vary for the purpose of getting the best possible experience during the release. Better good and late than bad and early.</p>

<h2>The Campaign</h2>
<h3>The Developer</h3>
<p>The developer behind this game is Guido de Jong (thats me). I am 26 years old and a Technical Medicine student from the Netherlands. I've been working as a programmer now for over 3 years and have done many years of programming before that as a hobby. In November last year I've started this project as a challenge for myself to see if I could make a fun game in 48 hours. I was so pleased with the result, that I've decided to continue on working on the game.</p>
<p>I am assisted by the sound engineer Tim Beek who provides both the music and the sound effects for the game.</p>
<h3>The start of the campaign</h3>
<p>There are 4 main reasons why I am starting the campaign:</p>
<p><strong>The Prerequisite. </strong>Before starting the campaign, I wanted to make sure that a lot of code was completed. I also wanted to finish at least one model that would reflect the final style of the game. The the code I mentioned is for the main game mechanics. There is still a lot of programming to do, but those are mainly focused at the new content that will be added.</p>
<p><strong>The licenses. </strong>Another aspect is that I am unable to bring out the game with the licenses I currently own (mostly student version). So in order to be even able to bring out Mini Tank Battles, I must own these full licenses of the creation software.</p>
<p><strong>The company.</strong> It is a lot easier to have a company to bring out Mini Tank Battles. So part of the funds will be used to set up the company so I can actually bring out the game.</p>
<p><strong>More funding equals better and more content.</strong> As an initial goal I will replace all the temporary models for their full featured versions. If the campaign brings up more money, I am able to provide more content for the game. Since I am a better programmer than a modeler or texture artist, I would be able to fund the costs for external creation of this content. This will most likely speed up the process of the creation of the game as well as better quality of the content.</p>
<h2>The funding</h2>
<p>I've chosen a fixed funding campaign. I'm simply unable to decently bring out the game without severely cutting on the game features if the fixed funding is not met.</p>
<p>So why does Mini Tank Battles need funding? Most of the points are clear from ""The start of the campaign"". So here is a short version:</p>
<h3>Initial goals:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Financing the full licenses of the creation software/hardware.</li>
<li>Rent a server for at least one year to host the masterserver on to ensure stable multiplayer.</li>
<li>Start a small company to enable the release and further development of the game.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secondary goals:</h3>
<ul>
<li>More content for the game.
<ul>
<li>More levels</li>
<li>More weapons</li>
<li>More enemies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speed up the process of the game making as well</li>
<li>Experiment with other platforms for the release.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the Initial Goals are met, I will post more information about the secondary goals. I only want to make realistic goals.</p>
<p><img alt=""Mini Tank Battles Promo Shot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.minitankbattles.com/cji/i/promo/mtb_p5.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mini Tank Battles Promo Shot""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Perks</h2>
<h3 class=""title"">Beta pass</h3>
<p>If you like the idea, but don't have that much money, you could go for the beta pass perk. You will get closed beta access.</p>
<h3 class=""title"">Contributor mentioning</h3>
<p>Besides getting a beta pass, you will be mentioned in the end credits as contributor to the game.</p>
<h3 class=""title"">OST + Wallpaper pack</h3>
<p>Tim Beek is making a great soundtrack for the game. So if you get this perk, you will get the official digital soundtrack.</p>
<h3 class=""title"">Mini Tank Battles - The Game</h3>
<p>You get a windows, mac or linux version of the game as well as the perks above. This is pretty much equal to the deluxe version of the game.</p>
<h3 class=""title"">MTB + Bull skull hood ornament</h3>
<p>So it's great you have the deluxe version at home, but wouldn't is be even better that other players can see that you have contributed with an unique item? With this Bull skull hood ornament for ingame you can distinguish yourself from the other players. This item can only be aquired through the indiegogo campaign. A screenshot of the ornament will be posted here as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 class=""title"">MTB + Gold plating</h3>
<p>So now you have the deluxe version and your skull hood ornament. If you think the bull skull hood ornament isn't enough, why not adding gold plating to your vehicles? This plating is bound to be recognized from a distance. This is another item can only be aquired through the indiegogo campaign</p>
<h3 class=""title"">MTB + Gear design</h3>
<p>Well if you like the idea of shooting with your own designed weapons ingame or have a special piece of armor, then this is your perk to match your gold plating and bull skull hood ornament. Together with the developer you will be able to design a piece of gear for a class, turret or boss. You will be mentioned for that in the end credits. <strong>Limit of 15.</strong></p>
<h3 class=""title"">MTB + Level design</h3>
<p>If you are quite the architect, and wan't all the perks with the gold plating and above, this might be the perk for you. Together with the developer you will be able to design a level for one of the four game modes. You will be mentioned for that in the end credits. <strong>Limit of 10.</strong></p>
<h3 class=""title"">MTB - Great funder</h3>
<p>The same as ""MTB + Gold plating and below"" + you can choose between the ""MTB + Level design"" or ""MTB + Weapon design"" + You will be mentioned as ""Main funder"" in the opening credits.</p>
<p>You will also get a figurine of choice from a character ingame. <strong>Limit of 5</strong></p>

<b>VR-Gamers</b> is a small artistic team of gamers of the 1990-s. We're tired of slow-paced modern games with tons of tutorials and linear and boring level-design.</div>

<div>We are making our games with experimental gameplay to see what else we can bring into the genre, and looks like we are not that bad at that at all! ;D</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are making the game about some science facility where scientists were working on the new technologies, but then bad things started to happen - involving military attacks and massive destructions. The protagonist has the power to outrun the world - his muscles and reflexes have been boosted, so he can move ten times faster than the world, allowing him to dodge the falling dangerous stuff or even to use the debris as the slooooowly moving platforms.</div>

<div>So we've created not one, but <b>three playable prototypes</b> of our game to show what we can do and what kind of game could you receive!</div>

We are greenlit! It took just FIVE days for us to storm the Greenlight!



Who We Are & What We Do


VR-Gamers is a small artistic team of gamers of the 1990-s. We're tired of slow-paced modern games with tons of tutorials and linear and boring level-design.

We are making our games with experimental gameplay to see what else we can bring into the genre, and looks like we are not that bad at that at all! ;D

We are making the game about some science facility where scientists were working on the new technologies, but then bad things started to happen - involving military attacks and massive destructions. The protagonist has the power to outrun the world - his muscles and reflexes have been boosted, so he can move ten times faster than the world, allowing him to dodge the falling dangerous stuff or even to use the debris as the slooooowly moving platforms.

So we've created not one, but three playable prototypes of our game to show what we can do and what kind of game could you receive!


You can play the second and the third prototypes on the GameJolt and IndieDB. Also there's the web-version of prototype #2 available on our site.




Right now our team consists of 8 people in total:


Eugene Cone - the programmer with crazy gameplay ideas and knowledge of many aspects of the game development - he brought the idea of HASTE, coded the first prototype in 4 hours and then gathered us all;

Andrew Milovanov - the artist, that drew all the 2D-stuff and was watching over the art-style of the prototypes;

Vladimir Tugay - the musician... There could be semicolon, but there is one thing... That dude is the one of the most famous Russian musicians, also known as Darkman007 - the real life guitar hero, tracker magician and former demoscene programmer;

Vladislav Nedviga - the 3D-artist, that used toaster with the vacuum cleaner attached to his computer in order to increase it's computing power and to create most of the sketches, models and textures for our game;

Cyril Arkhipov - the architect, that dude knows everything about how to construct the buildings and how mow them down without a bulldozer;

Kirill Akimov - the foley artist and sound designer, he has the awesome recording gear and abilities to squeeze the beautiful sounds from the sound of  falling potatoes;

Cory Aileen - voice actress, youtube letsplayer, that dropped the most amount of the F-bombs possible using her beautifully strong voice - we just couldn't pass her by and not invite her in our team;

Tyler Box - voice actor, youtube letsplayer, the owner of the most impressive beard among the letsplayers and also of the decent voice.


We passionately love oldschool games and really miss them very much, so that's why we've grouped to make something new, but interesting and understandable without many explanations and tons of hints.

You might ask: ""So, where's your team's Facebook page?!"" - well, there is one, but on the russian li'l brother of Facebook, and it's written all over with our strange Cyrillic symbols :D
OK, there is one on the Facebook too, but due to lack of players' attention it's a bit deserted =)






What We Need & What You Get

When we sat down and calculated all the expenses that would allow us to pay for the advanced hardware, software, taxes and office for comfortable game development, we ended up with sum of 175 000 dollars - that was the perfect amount of money but there was an opinion that we won't be able to raise that much,..
So we sat down again, re-calculated everything and decided, that 95 000 dollars could be enough for creation of the game without renting an office, buying other less expensive and less useful stuff and without hiring a more experienced animator.
Perks... They're simple: the more money you put in the game - the more cool stuff you'll receive: if you're generous enough, you will get not only the game with soundtracks and T-Shirt, but also you'll be able to show off among your friends - because we will create a character based on YOU.

What will we do if we exceed needed amount of money? 
Well... We'll settle down for the DLC's and ports for the platforms other than Mac or PC. Our programmer will take a closer look at Oculus Rift (he had luck to touch and write a small game for DK1). We have very warm feelings about OUYA, but haven't time to work with it yet...
What will happen if we fail raising the funds? 
Oh... That will be the epic fail... Loss of 8 months of hard work and kilometers of wasted nerve strings... You'll have your money back and we will have to switch to the creation of something more simple, more casual, more stupid, more ""nya-nya-nya"", more idiotic... Mobile apps time-killers, maybe... That would be terrible... Don't wanna think about that, guys. =(






The Impact

 Why our project is valuable... Well, we are passionate about bringing cool oldschool feelings about games back. There was the time when games could teach players how to play without showing any arrows, without any NPC's telling what to do. Those games acted like the player is smart enough to play without additional help. Those games were challenging, but brought insanely huge amount of awesome gaming experience through smart level-design, cool soundtrack and replayability.
So that's what our project is all about. Cool oldschool game with a good use of modern knowledge and technologies about time control and epic destructions.





Risks & Challenges
 As we are healthy enough - there's very small risk of us abandoning the game due to the sickness :D
Our programmer knows how to write the code and how to make the stuff work, so there won't be big challenges in the programming and level design - it's just a matter of time (short time of course).






Other Ways You Can Help
 If you like our game, but don't have the money or abilities to contribute, don't worry, you can help us by sharing the information about our campaign with your friends, parents, neighbors, pets, presidents (OMG, that might be too much :D)...

<p>Lifewonders is a small Japanese company founded in 2014 to provide digital entertainment for LGBT people, starting with mobile games. </p>
<p>If this is your first time hearing about us, we appreciate your interest! If you’re already familiar with us, thank you so much for your continued support. </p>
<p>Our first title is an app aimed at gay men titled Shoukan Yuusha to F-kei Kareshi, which is currently on the Japanese App Store and Google Play. </p>
<p>In this homage to classic JRPGs, you play as a male hero who is summoned to the fantasy world of Midearth to save it from a demon king.</p>
<p>As if your hands aren't full enough, you’ll also be forming bonds and falling in love with characters such as a fierce horned ogre, a monk skilled in magic, a rough Adventurer’s Guild master, and a dragon in the form of a man (all male characters!).  </p>
<p>For more information, please head to the official website. <a href=""http://f-kare.jp/?lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://f-kare.jp/?lang=en</a></p>
<p>While our current project was developed with the goal of targeting the specific demographic of gay men, we hope to expand our projects to appeal to players of every sex, gender, and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>We want to release products that we can be proud of, and that entertain as many people as possible!</p>
<p>This project’s success will show that there are many players who are looking for different kinds of romantic relationships in their video games. </p>
<p>We believe that more and more startups in digital media such as comics and games that include various kinds of romantic relationships will only enrich video game culture. </p>
<p>In addition, it is also one of our major goals to see more LGBT and ally developers in digital media. </p>
<p>From genres such as RPGs, adventure games, visual novels, action games, and shoot ‘em ups, to media such as novels, comics, and art books… We hope to see all these and more delivered to as many people as possible. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>/For our friends in Japan</p>

<p>初めての方は、初めまして。既にご存じの方は、いつもありがとうございます。</p>
<p>我々は2014年に設立され、アプリゲームをはじめとするLGBT向けデジタルエンターテイメントの製作・販売事業を行っているライフワンダーズという日本の小さな会社です。</p>
<p>現在、弊社では日本のApp StoreおよびGoogle Playにて『召喚勇者とＦ系彼氏』という男性ゲイ向けのファンタジーゲーム作品の日本語アプリゲームを販売しております。</p>
<p>ファンタジー世界に召喚された男の勇者が、角の生えたオーガ族や法術を操る修道僧、冒険者ギルドの渋いマスターやドラゴンの化身（全て男性キャラです！）と恋の絆を育み、ついでに魔王を倒して世界も救ってしまう…というＪＲＰＧをオマージュした作品となっております。詳しくは、公式ウェブサイトをご覧ください。<a href=""http://f-kare.jp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://f-kare.jp</a></p>
<p>弊社事業の展開は現在、ある程度の規模のマーケットが既に存在する、男性ゲイ向けコンテンツの展開に留まっておりますが、少しずつ事業を拡張し、あらゆる性別・性自認・性指向のプレイヤーが自分らしく楽しめ、そして何よりも娯楽作品として面白い！と自分たちが胸を張って送り出せる作品を作りたいと考えております。</p>
<p>この事業が成功し、「多様な恋愛関係を実現できることを求めているゲームプレイヤーは大勢いるのだ」という事が証明できたとき、より多くのコミック・ゲームをはじめとしたデジタル作品の開発会社・個人はより多様な恋愛関係を積極的に導入するようになり、ゲーム文化はもっともっと豊かになるのではないかと考えております。</p>
<p>また、LGBTおよびそのAlly（支援者）であるコンテンツ製作者が活躍できる舞台を増やす事も弊社の大きな目標の一つです。</p>
<p>ＲＰＧ、ＡＤＶ、ノベル、ＡＣＴ、ＳＴＧ。そしてコミック、ノベル、画集、立体…といった、多様なジャンル、多様な媒体の作品をより多くの方に届けられるようになりたいと考えております。</p>

<p>We believe in order to reach this goal, we must release our game not only in our home country of Japan, but to the rest of the world, as well. </p>
<p>First, we announced that production had started on the English version of Fantastic Boyfriends: Legends of Midearth on our social media channels.</p>
<p>We received many comments and kind words of encouragement… However, due to insufficient development funds, work on the English version has not progressed at a favorable speed.</p>
<p>In order to get the English version out as fast as possible, we have decided to start an Indiegogo project to raise the necessary funds. </p>
<p>If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, we would love to hear from you! </p>
<p></p>
<p>This campaign is set to fixed funding. In the case that we do not reach our goal, all backers will be refunded. Even if we should not reach our goal, we will continue to develop Fantastic Boyfriends. However, it may take additional time because our <br/>funding will be dependent on the success of our other projects.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>/For our friends in Japan</p>
<p></p>
<p>上記の目標を達成する為には、当社が設立された日本国内だけではなく、国外へ向けて発信していくことが必要不可欠と考えており、まずは英語版『Ｆ彼』であるFantastic Boyfriends:Legends of Midearth（以下、FB)の製作開始をアナウンスしました。</p>
<p>これについてたくさん、応援のメッセージを頂いております…が、開発費が不足している為、なかなか英語版の開発スピードを上げられずにいます。</p>
<p>今回、FBの開発費へのご支援を募る為、indiegogoにてプロジェクトを立ち上げることと致しました。本プロジェクトが成功すれば、FBの開発スピードを上げる事が出来ます！</p>
<p>もし弊社の理念にご共感・ご賛同して頂けるようであれば、是非、ご支援を検討頂ければ幸いです。</p>
<p>本キャンペーンはfixed fundingとなっており、不成立の場合、返却されます。不成立の場合でも英語版の開発は続けますが、別プロジェクトの利益で予算を確保しながらとなるため、成立の場合よりもリリースが遅くなる場合があります。</p>

Lifewonders is a small Japanese company founded in 2014 to provide digital entertainment for LGBT people, starting with mobile games. 
If this is your first time hearing about us, we appreciate your interest! If you’re already familiar with us, thank you so much for your continued support. 
Our first title is an app aimed at gay men titled Shoukan Yuusha to F-kei Kareshi, which is currently on the Japanese App Store and Google Play. 
In this homage to classic JRPGs, you play as a male hero who is summoned to the fantasy world of Midearth to save it from a demon king.
As if your hands aren't full enough, you’ll also be forming bonds and falling in love with characters such as a fierce horned ogre, a monk skilled in magic, a rough Adventurer’s Guild master, and a dragon in the form of a man (all male characters!).  
For more information, please head to the official website. http://f-kare.jp/?lang=en
While our current project was developed with the goal of targeting the specific demographic of gay men, we hope to expand our projects to appeal to players of every sex, gender, and sexual orientation.
We want to release products that we can be proud of, and that entertain as many people as possible!
This project’s success will show that there are many players who are looking for different kinds of romantic relationships in their video games. 
We believe that more and more startups in digital media such as comics and games that include various kinds of romantic relationships will only enrich video game culture. 
In addition, it is also one of our major goals to see more LGBT and ally developers in digital media. 
From genres such as RPGs, adventure games, visual novels, action games, and shoot ‘em ups, to media such as novels, comics, and art books… We hope to see all these and more delivered to as many people as possible.
