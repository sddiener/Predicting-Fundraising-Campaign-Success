<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sean Bryan and I'm most known for my participation in the NBC show American Ninja Warrior, where I have taken on the identity of the ""Papal Ninja."" I have also been called to a ministry known as the <a href=""http://laymission.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lay Mission Project</a>. </p>
<p>As a public figure, I am privileged to give talks around the country, inspiring and motivating youth and adults alike. Often I am asked where Papal Ninja gear could be purchased, and I respond by saying ""<a href=""http://papalninja.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">papalninja.com</a>."" The apparel on the website is made-to order, so I do not have to front the money to hold a stock of inventory. However, because of the lack of ""conversion"" from in-person impulse demand to online ordering and waiting 2 weeks for delivery, I find it important to front some money for a small stock of inventory with which I can travel. </p>
<p>The manufacturer of the shirts on papalninja.com is different than the one that makes the gear I wear on the show. This is because of price &amp; convenience factors. The shirts on papalninja.com are less expensive, and the workflow is such that the manufacturer handles all the ordering and shipping details. However, I have received many requests for the ""bioactive"" polyester shirts &amp; the sleek jacket that I wear at competitions. Because they are more expensive, it is also very difficult to keep a supply of these for in-person availability at talks and competitions. </p>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will make it possible for kids to proudly sport the faith, while kids and adults alike can support me, and the ministry I've been entrusted.</p>
<h3>Apparel</h3>
<p>The apparel on offer as ""perks"" for this campaign are the higher-end running shirts and jacket. </p>

<p>The shirts are manufactured from non-chafing soft materials that will not shrink. The bioactive polyester Run-Tex fabric wicks excess moisture, keeping you dry, so you'll be able to play longer without getting overheated. </p>
<p>The soft-shell jacket has a wind resistant membrane that allows moisture to escape while keeping the cold out. It’s lightweight and features two zipper pockets, two interior pockets, elastic side panels, thin stylish reflectors on each arm, and a drawstring around the waist.</p>

<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>In order to have an adequate inventory to supply for the demands of the people who attend my talks, and the fans who come to the competitions, I need to raise at least $1500 more than the cost of the shirts themselves. Supporters can either contribute enough to cover their own ""perks,"" or they can contribute an additional amount to help fund this inventory campaign.<br/><br/><strong>Profit Margins?</strong><br/>I do not make money off apparel. All surplus funds toward making the Papal Ninja buttons (mentioned at the end of the campaign video) to encourage the youth whom I encounter. My markup per shirt on papalninja.com is about $4. This is enough to make about 16 buttons to give away. Thus far I have given away around 4,500 buttons, and have an inventory of roughly 1,000. I also give away shirts and autographed glossy's that cost quite a bit. Doing the math, around $1,375 has been invested into giving away buttons, and I several hundred dollars worth of shirts and other giveaways; it may seem like a lot, but you should se the kids' faces when I give them a glossy, or a shirt, or even a button!!! If the shirts become more popular that expected, and the surplus from the shirts exceeds what's needed to make the buttons, I will lower the prices of the shirts on papalninja.com, or find another way to invest the money strictly for the good of the youth to whom I'm sent.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>How do I claim more than one perk?</h3>
<p>Most IndieGoGo projects offer ""perks"" as a thank you for backing a campaign. If you would like more than one perk, you can do this too!</p>
<ul>
<li>If just want one perk (including one perk that includes multiple of the same item, i.e. 2 mozzetta shirts) and you do not want to donate any additional funds to the campaign, you can simply click one of the links on the right that say ""get this perk.""</li>
<li>If you want multiple perks, or if you want to simply donate more money to help fund the inventory I need, then use the option at the top right that says ""Back It."" When you click that button, you can enter your donation amount. Keep in mind that in order to obtain perks through this method, you should include shipping costs (listed in the details of each perk). </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is zero risk for you! I will fulfill all backers' ""perks,"" even if I don't reach my goal. Additionally, if my inadequacies in marketing result in a weak campaign, I find it more important to provide for the demands of the fans than to deprive them of the psycho-spiritual benefits they receive from sporting Papal Ninja gear, so if necessary, I will be going out-of-pocket for the inventory!</p>
</div><div>
<p>I know some people just aren't in the financial position to contribute, and if that's you, there are other ways, you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prayers are effective, and much appreciated!</li>
<li>Comments of encouragement on my social pages keep me focused on the mission</li>
<li>Get the word out! IndieGoGo has share tools to make this easy to share this campaign on social media.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Sizing</h3>
<p>Please read this section carefully! The shirts are rather expensive to make a sizing error. The size charts below are manufacturer suggestions only, and were designed for casual wear. If you want more of a slim-fit athletic look, choose one or even two number sizes smaller. For example, Sean Bryan’s chest size is on the below chart is on the border between a size 7 and 8, but for competition he wears a size 6. So if you want a slim-fit or athletic look and are right in the middle of a shirt size, then perhaps one number size smaller is right for you. If you are on the boarder between sizes and want that same look, perhaps 2 sizes smaller is good for you. If you want the casual, relaxed fit, then the chart's sizing is fairly accurate. Remember, these shirts will not shrink.</p>
<p>Note: Due to IndieGoGo's limitations on the number of options perks may have, when selecting your size, you will have to choose not only your size in the correct ""Size Range,"" but you also need to select ""other"" in the other two size ranges. Sorry for the inconvenience, but it will make more sense when you get to that step.</p>
<p><strong>Jacket &amp; Mozzetta Shirt Sizing</strong><br/>Both men and women  refer to “men’s tops” sizes for both the “Mozzetta Jacket” and the “Mozzetta Shirt.”</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521420872/oqxx1tqfnb4y5axy95sa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vatican Flag Shirt Sizing</strong></p>
<p> You may refer to both “men’s top” and “women’s top” sizes respectively. The “women’s top” sizes are designed for women with more of an hourglass shape or athletic build. For women without these particular builds, it’s better to refer to specify a “men’s top” size in the perks options when claiming a perk.</p>

It might sound silly right? </p><p>But Brett learned from his friends who were babysitting that it was difficult to find a safe, clean, comfortable place to change a diaper when traveling with a baby. Moms reported that even going to a park was worrisome, because there are so few safe, clean places to change a baby when away from home.</p><p>So after becoming an Uncle, he decided to change that.</p><p>His mentor, entrepreneur and mom Barbara (now a new grandmother herself) later joined him to address that market need and launched OTGbaby to create an innovative diaper bag backpack that has a hidden changing station for on-the-go diaper changes anytime, anywhere, even when you're at Grandma's house. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603414312/frcoonzuqgrl0zto2v1y.png"" src=""""/></p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603470761/gm4lwxdflreeb8mxxxhu.png"" src=""""/></h3><h3>Why we made this:</h3><p>The OTGbaby team conducted focus groups across the US and identified what moms and dads really want in a portable diaper changing station: lots of storage, easy to use when you're away from home, everything you need for diaper changes, and stylish design.</p><p>As we created The Go Bag, we’ve addressed each of these areas to create the perfect diaper changing backpack for active families.

We're OTGbaby.We design innovative premium diaper bags for the active family.The Go Bag is a Diaper Changing Backpack that features patented technology and a portable changing station that's hidden inside this stylish diaper bag.We provide parents with a safe, clean place to confidently change their baby on-the-go. To preorder our Diaper Changing Backpack, click Back This Project. Or read on!How we got started:OTGbaby was founded by Brett Guterman who was a high school student when he discovered a gap in the diaper bag market. It might sound silly right? But Brett learned from his friends who were babysitting that it was difficult to find a safe, clean, comfortable place to change a diaper when traveling with a baby. Moms reported that even going to a park was worrisome, because there are so few safe, clean places to change a baby when away from home.So after becoming an Uncle, he decided to change that.His mentor, entrepreneur and mom Barbara (now a new grandmother herself) later joined him to address that market need and launched OTGbaby to create an innovative diaper bag backpack that has a hidden changing station for on-the-go diaper changes anytime, anywhere, even when you're at Grandma's house. Why we made this:The OTGbaby team conducted focus groups across the US and identified what moms and dads really want in a portable diaper changing station: lots of storage, easy to use when you're away from home, everything you need for diaper changes, and stylish design.As we created The Go Bag, we’ve addressed each of these areas to create the perfect diaper changing backpack for active families. With a patented design and built-in diaper changing station, this lightweight bag – made from vegan leather – will instantly be your favorite diaper bag backpack for traveling with your baby. Face it, a baby's diaper needs to be changed up to 10 times a day, no matter where you might be. Whether you’re at a coffee shop, in a park, on a hike, or even at a friend’s backyard barbecue, you shouldn’t have to ask yourself, “Can I change my baby here?” The Diaper Changing Backpack by OTGbaby puts you in control of diaper changes when you're traveling with baby. Made from 100% vegan leather with a built-in, water-repellant diaper changing station that unzips in seconds so moms and dads can be ready for on-the-go diaper changes anytime, anywhere. Designed with a stylish gender neutral exterior, this backpack is perfect for mom or dad. And since, dad's have an especially tough time while on-the-go, as there are rarely (or no) changing tables in men’s rooms, this is the most friendly diaper bag on the planet! Not your every day diaper bag!It's not just the stylish look and large capacity that makes the bag unique, this clever diaper bag backpack has a hidden changing station that unzips for on-the-go diaper changes anytime, anywhere. The Go Bag by OTGbaby is not your everyday diaper bag, it's the diaper changing backpack you never knew you needed (until now)!Exterior:Designed with active families in mind, this bag is lightweight and luxurious featuring sleek lines, vegan leather and locking YKK zippers. With multiple compartments and in 3 fashion-forward color options, there's no sacrificing style here!

<h2><strong>Self Taught Starter!<br/></strong></h2>
<p>Since I graduated from San Diego State University with a BS in Psychology, my career has always been in non- profit healthcare and most recently working with elderly women. I also learned to do things myself because I never had a budget.</p>
<p>After many years of teaching myself about photography, Photoshop, website design, jewelry design and branding, I want to launch my lifelong dream of creating timeless jewelry for modern women of all ages. With the support and encouragement from the women in San Diego, we want to see my unique jewelry ideas and designs available for everyone!</p>
<h3><strong>CREATING JEWELRY to HELP YOU REMEMBER</strong></h3>
<p>During the last few years, I became fascinated and inspired by understanding how deep emotions can be associated with jewelry.  I asked myself, ""If I can  create an association with something great, passionate and inspiring and jewelry, why not create jewelry to inspire you to eat healthy?""</p>
<h3><strong>The ALL AMERICAN CHALLENGE to Eat Healthy</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Like most Americans, we are so busy with our fast paced lives and we don't eat right. It's very easy to be distracted with so many daily tasks and goals. I am easily distracted and it's very challenging to stay on track, especially when it comes to eating right.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><br/>The first time I signed up for a diet program, I instinctively knew that I was going to be in big trouble!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The most valuable part of any good nutritional plan or diet is to write down what you are eating so you can track your deadly sins. <br/><br/>This modern method of TAR and FEATHERS worked for me, but only lasted a few weeks.<br/><br/><strong>After a few weeks, I started to forget to write in my food journal. Then I stopped going to my meeting. Then I had buyers remorse. Then I started eating cupcakes.</strong></p>
<h2>Many people are embarressed to say they are on a diet or are having trouble remembering to stay on track...even if they are young.</h2>
<h2>
<br/><strong>THE SOLUTION to My Personal Challenge<br/></strong>
</h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I wanted to stick to the rules of a good nutritional program, but I needed something VISUAL and CONSTANTLY IN MY FACE. I also love and design jewelry.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I decided to try something NEW and DIFFERENT! <strong>I incorporated the great tools and advice I learned in my diet program, and twisted the method of logging what I ate!</strong><br/><br/></p>
<h3>I used my love and passion for jewelry and combined the power of color association to create visual reminder jewelry called SNACKER STACKERS.</h3>
<h2>SNACKER STACKERS are a  discreet way to remember daily tasks, LIKE EATING HEALTHY</h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Snacker Stackers make it easier to stay on track with daily food intake by using beautiful jewelry accessories as a constant visual reminder to eat healthy.</p>
<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SNACKER STACKERS™ are placed on your wrist in the morning. As you complete a food group for the day, you move that bracelet (food category) to your other wrist!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They are a simple, lightweight, comfortable and easy to use jewelry accessory to help supplement your already healthy eating program. Snacker Stackers may also help you make better food choices during the day.</li>
<li>
<p>SNACKER STACKERS™ are helpful even if you are on a structured diet program that may use points, calories or purchased food.<strong> Anyone who struggles with eating right needs SNACKER STACKERS. </strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Other Reminder Projects</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Memory issues affect millions of people.</strong>  Working with memory impaired people has empowered me to help create other usful reminder products like RemindSIGNS.</li>
<li>
<strong>RemindSIGNS</strong> was created from the need to help advanced memory impaired elderly people. This loving project was co-created by myself and a wonderful partner. It was my original inspiration of creating signs for my grandmother to place around the house that led to that project.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Snacker Stackers can help all ages of people to stay on track:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>CHILDREN- chores</li>
<li>TEENS-homework</li>
<li>ERRANDS-laundry, store, mail, grocery lists</li>
<li>IMPORTANT EVENTS-anniversaries, birthdays etc</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>
<strong>How can you help?</strong><br/>Women have been desperate to use my Snacker Stackers bracelets, however, I do not have the funds to make the thousands of sets I need.</h2>
<h3>Each set includes 7 bracelets plus the packaging:</h3>
<ul>
<li>  WATER/ BLUE  </li>
<li>  VEGETABLE/ GREEN  </li>
<li>  FRUIT/ RED  </li>
<li>  PROTEIN/ BROWN  </li>
<li>  CARBOHYDRATE/ PINK  </li>
<li>  FAT/ YELLOW  </li>
<li>  DAIRY/ WHITE  </li>
</ul><p>Funds would be used to</p>
<ul>
<li>hire people to make the SNACKER STACKER jewelry at an affordable cost and</li>
<li>produce enough sets to appropriately test and market this unique idea to real women, children (and men)</li>
</ul><h3>I created all the designs, marketing concepts, patent pending, branding, website, logo and taken all the photographs. I do not need funds for that reason!</h3>
<h3>The more funds you contribute, the more Americans will have this unique way of remembering to eat right!</h3>

</div></div>","Self Taught Starter!
Since I graduated from San Diego State University with a BS in Psychology, my career has always been in non- profit healthcare and most recently working with elderly women. I also learned to do things myself because I never had a budget.
After many years of teaching myself about photography, Photoshop, website design, jewelry design and branding, I want to launch my lifelong dream of creating timeless jewelry for modern women of all ages. With the support and encouragement from the women in San Diego, we want to see my unique jewelry ideas and designs available for everyone!
CREATING JEWELRY to HELP YOU REMEMBER
During the last few years, I became fascinated and inspired by understanding how deep emotions can be associated with jewelry.  I asked myself, ""If I can  create an association with something great, passionate and inspiring and jewelry, why not create jewelry to inspire you to eat healthy?""
The ALL AMERICAN CHALLENGE to Eat Healthy
Like most Americans, we are so busy with our fast paced lives and we don't eat right. It's very easy to be distracted with so many daily tasks and goals. I am easily distracted and it's very challenging to stay on track, especially when it comes to eating right.
The first time I signed up for a diet program, I instinctively knew that I was going to be in big trouble!
The most valuable part of any good nutritional plan or diet is to write down what you are eating so you can track your deadly sins. This modern method of TAR and FEATHERS worked for me, but only lasted a few weeks.After a few weeks, I started to forget to write in my food journal. Then I stopped going to my meeting. Then I had buyers remorse. Then I started eating cupcakes.
Many people are embarressed to say they are on a diet or are having trouble remembering to stay on track...even if they are young.

THE SOLUTION to My Personal Challenge

I wanted to stick to the rules of a good nutritional program, but I needed something VISUAL and CONSTANTLY IN MY FACE. I also love and design jewelry.
I decided to try something NEW and DIFFERENT! I incorporated the great tools and advice I learned in my diet program, and twisted the method of logging what I ate!
I used my love and passion for jewelry and combined the power of color association to create visual reminder jewelry called SNACKER STACKERS.
SNACKER STACKERS are a  discreet way to remember daily tasks, LIKE EATING HEALTHY
Snacker Stackers make it easier to stay on track with daily food intake by using beautiful jewelry accessories as a constant visual reminder to eat healthy.
HOW IT WORKS

SNACKER STACKERS™ are placed on your wrist in the morning. As you complete a food group for the day, you move that bracelet (food category) to your other wrist!


They are a simple, lightweight, comfortable and easy to use jewelry accessory to help supplement your already healthy eating program. Snacker Stackers may also help you make better food choices during the day.

SNACKER STACKERS™ are helpful even if you are on a structured diet program that may use points, calories or purchased food. Anyone who struggles with eating right needs SNACKER STACKERS. 


Other Reminder Projects


Memory issues affect millions of people.  Working with memory impaired people has empowered me to help create other usful reminder products like RemindSIGNS.

RemindSIGNS was created from the need to help advanced memory impaired elderly people. This loving project was co-created by myself and a wonderful partner. It was my original inspiration of creating signs for my grandmother to place around the house that led to that project.



Snacker Stackers can help all ages of people to stay on track:

CHILDREN- chores
TEENS-homework
ERRANDS-laundry, store, mail, grocery lists
IMPORTANT EVENTS-anniversaries, birthdays etc



How can you help?Women have been desperate to use my Snacker Stackers bracelets, however, I do not have the funds to make the thousands of sets I need.
Each set includes 7 bracelets plus the packaging:

  WATER/ BLUE  
  VEGETABLE/ GREEN  
  FRUIT/ RED  
  PROTEIN/ BROWN  
  CARBOHYDRATE/ PINK  
  FAT/ YELLOW  
  DAIRY/ WHITE  
Funds would be used to

hire people to make the SNACKER STACKER jewelry at an affordable cost and
produce enough sets to appropriately test and market this unique idea to real women, children (and men)
I created all the designs, marketing concepts, patent pending, branding, website, logo and taken all the photographs. I do not need funds for that reason!
The more funds you contribute, the more Americans will have this unique way of remembering to eat right!

designer shirt; a Zegna, an Armani, a Burberry. Some of us might not know this
but brands artificially inflate prices and invest heavily in marketing to
create an illusion of high quality. At the end of the day, what you are paying
for is the label and not the shirt itself. Given our desire to want the finest quality we are under the impression that we get what we pay for. This is the illusion
that the fashion industry has created.</p><p>
It’s time we change the way we look and shop for clothes. We all need to be
aware of what goes into making the clothes that we wear today as opposed to being influenced by brand marketing. We need to start
appreciating the smaller details that differentiate the finest from the average. It’s the small things that matter when it comes to high quality clothing.
Believe it or not most of us don’t even know what these details are.</p>
<p>With your support for this campaign, we can change this;
together.  We want to show you that you
don’t have to pay for the brand inflation and retail mark ups that we’ve all grown

Check out what he has to say here.Making Luxury AffordableAt some point in our lives, we’ve all wanted to own a
designer shirt; a Zegna, an Armani, a Burberry. Some of us might not know this
but brands artificially inflate prices and invest heavily in marketing to
create an illusion of high quality. At the end of the day, what you are paying
for is the label and not the shirt itself. Given our desire to want the finest quality we are under the impression that we get what we pay for. This is the illusion
that the fashion industry has created.
It’s time we change the way we look and shop for clothes. We all need to be
aware of what goes into making the clothes that we wear today as opposed to being influenced by brand marketing. We need to start
appreciating the smaller details that differentiate the finest from the average. It’s the small things that matter when it comes to high quality clothing.
Believe it or not most of us don’t even know what these details are.
With your support for this campaign, we can change this;
together.  We want to show you that you
don’t have to pay for the brand inflation and retail mark ups that we’ve all grown
to accept as customary. We want to bring you the best quality dress shirts at a
price that is not artificially inflated. We want to bring you the finest custom

These guys are champs, with an easy to use site and top notch suits. Shipped promptly half-way across the world and arriving in top condition, I couldn't be happier with mine. These guys care about making you look good""This isn’t our first endeavour!
Since we started in September of 2013, we’ve done quite a bit. We introduced
our first collection of essential suits and accessories. Check them out here: www.buttonsnthreads.com
We have a fully functioning website and a slick order
process. We also have experience in order fulfilment and logistics planning. 
We want to offer the complete range of custom tailored
clothing for men. These fine dress shirts are the next step in this process. But, we need
your help to get it done.
Each project has its own risks, but we are confident we can
get it done. If any challenges arise, we WILL let you know, but we have a great
factory backing us and we don’t anticipate many issues. WE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN.How do I submit measurements?
Don’t worry you’re in good hands. Once the funding period is
over we will send you a link on our website where you can enter in your
details, customisations and measurements. We've made easy to follow video
guides so you have nothing to worry about. All you’ll need is a friend and a
measuring tape. 
Can I provide two different sets of measurements? 
Unfortunately we cannot accept two measurement profiles
under the same name. To create a seamless shopping experience, we will store
your details and measurements on our system, so the next time you order you
won’t have to go through the measurement process again. 
Do you ship internationally? What are the charges?
We’re offering free international shipping through DHL to
over 200 countries. You won’t have to pay anything extra for shipping. 
Why are your suits a part of the perks?When we started in September 2013, we started with a basic collection of custom tailored suits. Our suits are made using Australian Merino Wool sourced from mills in Italy (Gladsons) and England (Huddersfield). We thought that our suits would complement these fine dress shirts well and hence the decision to include them in some of our perks. What if my shirt doesn't fit?
Not to worry. We have an alteration, a remake and return
policy to ensure that you’re shopping completely risk free. 
Alteration Policy: If your shirt requires minor alterations
we will credit back up to $25 to cover the cost of alterations.
Remake Policy: If your shirt doesn't fit you beyond minor alterations, you can
send it back to us and we will replace the shirt for you at no extra cost. 
Refund Policy: If there is something seriously wrong with
your shirt, you can send it back to us for a complete refund. Refund should be
claimed within 21 days from date of delivery. 
What if there are any issues with quality?
We are so confident with the quality of our shirts that if
you find anything wrong with any quality aspect, we will remake the shirt for
you at no extra cost. 
When is the expected delivery?
We expect to be able to ship out all the custom shirts by the end of July 2014. 
Can I make my suits a three piece?
Yes, if you wish to make your suits a three piece, please
pledge an extra $50 in your contribution. 
What if I want to add some additional customisations?
If there is a particular customisation that we do not offer,
but you would like it on your shirt, please get in touch with us and we will
try and accommodate your request if possible. We want your shirts to be unique
to you and we will try our best to make that happen.
Are additional customisations chargeable?
All customisations that we offer are free of charge. There might
be some requests that require additional labour or material charges; please get
in touch with us in case of specific requests and we will sort it out for you.
Where can I buy your product after the campaign ends?
Our products will be available on our website that you would
have helped make possible. We will offer the shirts exclusively for members who
have helped fund our project, such as you. 
Why can’t I pay through PayPal?

As we have launched this campaign out of India,
the Reserve Bank of India has limitations with regards to receiving funds
through PayPal. This is an issue that PayPal has been working with the
government to get sorted. More details can be found here: http://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526426-International-PayPal-Restrictions

<p><strong>Thank you for considering donating to my campaign!</strong></p>
<p>  First off, it may look like I already have together, i.e. many people tell me my brand is ""the BOMB"", but <strong>I haven't had the means to sell suit's yet... and THAT'S WHY I'M HERE!</strong></p>
<p>As a <strong>start-up</strong> with great potential, minus the proper amount of funding, it has taken me many years to get my design idea sketches made into samples.  The samples are what you now see on the models, which have been showcased at fashion shows and photo shoots.  Despite the demand, Cherry Bomb is now at a sticking point without money for fabric, manufacturing and inventory.  Thus, I can't move forward until I have inventory to sell!</p>
<p>My brand has the foundation paved as far as the first samples/styles, some patterns, photo's, a website and some exposure. This was only achieved with great thanks to family, friends, models, photographers and videographers, etc. who donated money, their time to model, photograph, and video for me!   With just over $15,000 of my own money, I was able to get to this point, which of course I'm very proud of nonetheless.  I believe in my passion and have come so far and yet so close, so I can't give up now!</p>
<p>This has been such a blessing and quite a journey, hence this small town girl's motto is ""Don't Stop Believin'!""</p>
<p>So thanks to your help, Cherry Bomb will be another great success story due to the collaboration of many great people like you! <strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ABOUT my Brand</strong></p>
<p>Cherry Bomb suits are quality made with luxurious fabrics, and will be made right here in the USA.</p>
<p>We want you to feel great about who you are and how you look, and feel unique as you are in our suits.<br/>A high-end line with an edgy vibe... that's Cherry Bomb.</p>
<p>My swimsuits are more than a string bikini, they cross over to a new category of swimwear… a new ERA of swim fashion... It's <strong>SWIM COUTURE</strong>.</p>
<p>It's a sweet &amp; spicy mix of Rock-n-Roll, Pin-Up, &amp; Futuristic Fashion!<br/>CB is a reflection of music, people, and art.<br/>An era that’s unfrozen in time… Merging the past, present, &amp; the future.<br/>A little bite of it all... it's the best of everything.</p>

<p>It has taken me many years to get here, but I’m a fighter… and believe anything is possible. I never gave up and despite many odds, I launched my Brand and have opened the Pandora’s box.</p>
<p>I’m a strong woman who overcame many struggles including leaving an abusive relationship, and being homeless. I am proof that women are strong and smart and can achieve anything they set their mind too!</p>
<p>I want my Brand to EMPOWER women to be confident, driven, and sassy despite any struggles or insecurities b/c that makes us stand out, not blend in.</p>
<p> My Brand has been on our local news, in a magazine, a poolside event, and was even part of 2 Fashion Shows... not a bad way to start and now I've been asked to participate in MIAMI Swim Week!</p>
<p>Scary-yes... BUT, I'm not one to sit on the sidelines and wait for things to be perfect, the time is here &amp; now and so I said YES and here I am! </p>
<p>I want to share my love of designing with the world and be that testimony to inspire other's to believe in their own dream, and never give up... b/c eventually persistence and passion pays off. </p>
<p>Once my Brand is going strong, we will be involved in helping women overcome &amp; awareness of Domestic Violence. We want to give back too and can't wait to do great things together! </p>

<p>We can ease your tech aches and pains.</p>
<p>The Kreyos Meteor is a hands-free, two-way communication system that you wear on your wrist. On your belt. On your bike. Or even on a lanyard around your neck.</p>
<p>Because it is light and portable, it’s easy to wear while on the move – whether you’re on a long bike ride or a short-trip to the grocery store.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, you now will have hands-free control over the powerhouse mini-computer that sits in your pocket.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kreyosimages.s3.amazonaws.com/ks_3stack.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kreyosimages.s3.amazonaws.com/ks_titles_voicecontrol.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (01-JULY-2013): <a href=""http://www.kreyos.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kreyos Meteor</a> has the ability to answer phone calls DIRECTLY from your wrist </strong><span><strong>without reaching for your phone in the pocket. You can answer the call with a  gesture or by simply pressing the answer button on the watch. </strong></span><strong>We added this update as many backers are </strong><span><strong>confu</strong></span><strong>sed whether they can answer calls from their wrist. </strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Quest</strong></span><strong>ion: Does the Kreyos Meteor have a sim card slot?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: No, your Kreyos needs to be connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth in order to answer calls. Its not meant to replace a smartphone.</strong></p>
<p><span>Since the first time Captain Kirk spoke into his “communicator,” people have dreamed of using their voice to control communications.  As the only waterproof, interactive smartwatch to feature a microphone and speaker, the Kreyos Meteor is the first to allow you to control your smartphone – and your smartphone functions – remotely using voice commands.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kreyosimages.s3.amazonaws.com/ks_voice_illustration.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>

<p class=""p1""><strong>UPDATE (28-JUNE-2013): Gestures controls could be configured in the free Kreyos App.</strong></p>
<p>Wish you could send texts without typing? Or change your music without pressing a button?</p>
<p>Talking to your watch makes communication easy, but we also added motion control right into the Kreyos operating system. Using a 3-axis gyroscope, controlling your Kreyos Meteor <a href=""http://www.kreyos.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Smart watch</a> is as easy as moving your hand.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kreyosimages.s3.amazonaws.com/ks_gesturecontrol.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the Meteor, four different wrist motions come preconfigured – and you can pick an action to correspond to specific activities. In the future, we’ll be adding a variety of additional motions to the Kreyos platform, enabling you to expand the motions in your repertoire. And developers also will have the freedom to build additional gestures into applications.</p>
<p>Because of its hands-free functionality, the Kreyos Meteor gives you more freedom to move around your world – without losing contact with your social, business and family networks.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kreyosimages.s3.amazonaws.com/ks_titles_smartwatchyourway.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span class=""s1""><strong>UPDATE (28-JUNE-2013):  </strong></span><strong>Kreyos Meteor can keep time even when disconnected from your phone. Kreyos Meteor also has inbuilt “widgets” that comes included. It <strong>works independently WITHOUT any smartphone connected.</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily Activity Tracker</strong></li>
<li><strong>Calendar </strong></li>
<li><strong>Countdown Timer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sports Mode – Walking, Running &amp; Cycling </strong></li>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>UPDATE (28-JUNE-2013): </strong></span><strong>We will be setting up a platform for developers to upload watch faces. Uploaded watch faces will then be available directly on the Kreyos App for downloading and pushing updates to the watch instantly.</strong></p>
<p>Customizing your watchface is easy.  The Meteor includes more than 20 digital and analog watch faces.  Change the look and feel of your watch whenever you feel like it.  Of course, 20 is just the beginning!  More to come in the future!</p>

<p>No two humans are alike. So why should everyone have to wear their smartwatch on their wrist? That’s why we created a series of watchbands and accessories designed to fit your lifestyle.</p>
<p>All of our watchbands and accessories are designed using high-grade, durable silicone. As a result, they are waterproof, flexible and fun to wear – whether you’re a couch potato, a fashionista, or a professional athlete! </p>
<p>This season, we’re offering our watchbands and accessories in a series of “hot” colors perfect for those who are fashion forward:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kreyosimages.s3.amazonaws.com/ks_accessory_beltclip.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kreyosimages.s3.amazonaws.com/ks_straps.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Because you can wear it as a watch, hang it from your belt, attach it to your bike or wear it around your neck, the Kreyos Meteor frees you up to do the things you need to do – without worrying about dropping or losing your smartphone.  And it gives you the freedom to communicate – via voice, text, or email – even when holding a phone or tablet is inconvenient.</p>
<p>Watch for more fun, flexible accessories and colors in the future!  You’ll want to collect them all!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kreyosimages.s3.amazonaws.com/ks_titles_gettingfit.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><span class=""s1"">UPDATE (28-JUNE-2013): Kreyos Meteor </span><span class=""s2"">has</span> a built-in accelerometer. Daily Activity “widgets” is built into the watch, so it tracks <span class=""s3"">stat</span>s like steps, floor climbs, calories and distance taken <span class=""s3"">dail</span>y. You will be able to sync them into your smartphone’s app. This is standalone, works totally fine without your smartphone with you. It automatically syncs the data to your app when its near the <span class=""s3"">smar</span>tphone.</strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Kreyos Meteor WILL WORK directly with bluetooth or ANT+ sensors without being connected to the smartphone. Meteor WILL BE ABLE to receive data directly from the sensors WITHOUT a smartphone connected and populate it on the watch.</strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Kreyos Meteor itself has a sports mode for people who wants to track when they start and stop activities like, Walking, Running &amp; Cycling. It has a 3,4,5 grid data option, CUSTOMIZABLE in any way you prefer . </strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Grid Options include the below:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong> a) Total Workout time</strong><br/><strong> b) Time of the day</strong><br/><strong> c) Total Distance</strong><br/><strong> d) Altitude</strong><br/><strong> e) Elevation Gain</strong><br/><strong> f) Speed</strong><br/><strong> g) Average Speed</strong><br/><strong> h) Top Speed</strong><br/><strong> i) Pace</strong><br/><strong> j) Average Pace</strong><br/><strong> k) Calories Burned</strong><br/><strong> l) Current Heart Rate</strong><br/><strong> m) Average Heart Rate</strong><br/><strong> n) Max Heart Rate</strong><br/><strong> o) Current Lap Time</strong><br/><strong> p) Average Lap Time</strong><br/><strong> q) Best Lap Time</strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Question 1: Is Kreyos Meteor able to show running speed data in sports mode?</strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>A: </strong>Yes, when a smartphone is NOT available, Kreyos uses metrics from the accelerometer and gyrometer and calculates your speed. In the event of a smartphone being available it will receive data from smartphone's GPS.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Question 2: Is Kreyos Meteor able to show Cycling speed data in sports mode independently?</strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>A: </strong>No, for cycling it will require either a smartphone GPS data available or a ANT+/Bluetooth Speed cadence sensor to show speed data on the watch.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Question 3: Is Kreyos Meteor able to show </strong><span class=""s1""><strong>H</strong></span><strong>eart rate data in sports mode independently?</strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>A: </strong>No, you will require a ANT+/Bluetooth Heart rate sensor for the watch to display the heart rate data.</p>

<p><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kreyosimages.s3.amazonaws.com/ks_water_2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><span>Or snorkeling offshore?  No matter what you love to do, the Kreyos Meteor will help you maintain your fitness, share your progress with friends and teammates, and shout your successes to the world…via social media!</span></p>

</p>
<p>Unlike the first-generation smartwatches that only provide one-way notifications, the Kreyos Meteor is the first and only interactive smartwatch to let you use voice and gestures to control your smartwatch.   Built into the operating system of the smartwatch itself, this technology is far beyond the capacities of the first-generation watches prepping for the market today.  In fact, voice and gesture control cannot be easily added to other watches because adding voice and gesture control requires hardware, rather than software, integration.</p>
<p>That means, quite simply, that the other “smartwatches” on the market won’t have full gesture and voice control capabilities for a long time --- if ever.</p>
<p>And that’s not all.  Because we already have our Kreyos Platform and proprietary operating system designed and developed, we are in the position of being able to get to market faster than anyone else.  In fact, we don’t need the money for development.  We need it for production.  And that means that as soon as we reach our target on Indiegogo, production begins.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And if you’re an early adopter now, you’ll be the first to hear about future upgrades to the Kreyos Smartwatch.  And you’ll be among the first to enjoy downloading new and exciting applications, programs and UI changes.  That’s right.  You won’t have to buy a new watch. You’ll update your watch online.  Simple.  Effective.  Powerful.</p>
<p>That’s the Kreyos Meteor.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kreyosimages.s3.amazonaws.com/ks_titles_techies.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><strong>UPDATE (28-JUNE-2013): Watch apps can be written in C. Also we will be creating <span>an desktop emulator, making it easy for interested developers to create watch apps for the Kreyos Meteor.</span></strong></strong></p>

<p>We expect to have our first batch ready for shipment in late November after we reach our Indiegogo goal. </p>
<p>As a supporter, you will be among the first to receive your own Kreyos Meteor. So pledge today – and you’ll be enjoying the most advanced smartwatch on the market in time for the holidays.</p>

<p>There are always significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering any electronics product at scale. Mass manufacturing isn't the same as prototype development with 3D printers; we have to make sure they are secure and reliable, and also most importantly that they can be manufactured efficiently at mass volumes.</p>
<p>BUT..............</p>
<h3><strong>Here's the GOOD NEWS:</strong></h3>
<p>a) We have completed MOST of our moulds required for injection parts. What you see in the pictures are ACTUAL injection samples, NOT PROTOTYPES made from 3D printers. This is a HUGE DIFFERENCE from other projects, which use prototypes made from 3D printers.  It is impossible to discover manufacturing issues when creating a prototype from a 3D printer. Injection moulds usually require long lead times up to 45 days. Of course, that doesn't include the unforeseen issues and edits that nees to be done to improve the mould.  Sometimes, that process can add 90 days to the original schedule.  But that's not in our ""worry"" equation now. it could take up to 90 days. But its all out of the ""worry"" equation now :)</p>
<p>b) Our team has more than 15 years of experience developing electronic and tech products. Kreyos Meteor is designed with mass production in mind.  Therefore, countless hours have been put into the ID design, PCB layouts, etc.  This ensures that we  won't have ""unforeseen"" issues during manufacturing and assembly.</p>
<p>c) EMS Manufacturing Partners - We partner with well-known EMS Factories (Electronics Manufacturing Service) to ensure we can manufacture the Kreyos Meteor on a mass scale. These EMS factories manufacture millions of electronic units monthly. With the Kreyos Meteor's layout, assembly and planning completed, any risk has also been decreased significantly.</p>
<h3>Now here's the RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES: </h3>
<p><strong>a) Component lead times &amp; availability</strong></p>
<p>Lead times vary for different components.  Some take as long as three months just to deliver. We will be splitting our component orders based on manufacturing times.  Therefore, as soon as we have a good idea of estimated orders, we will immediately place orders for components that take longer to manufacture first. This will decrease our time to receive the components from suppliers.</p>
<p><strong>b) Shipping Kreyos Meteor Worldwide</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of unforeseen circumstances that can cause problems during the actual physical shipping of the Kreyos Meteor. Therefore, we will be working directly with world-class fulfillment companies that are extremely experienced in logistic. This will ensure that we are able to get your KREYOS Meteor Smartwatch into your hands in the least amount of time!</p>
<p>In Conclusion:</p>
<p>WOW! Thank you for reading this far. We will be doing OUR BEST, using all OUR RESOURCES, EFFORTS and ENERGY to deliver the best Kreyos Meteor Smartwatch to you. At Kreyos, we want to help you mobilize your world -- and we going to do whatever needs to be done to deliver your new Meteor to you on time!  We promise! :)</p>

Be the First to Mobilize Your Life with the Kreyos 
All-In-One “Meteor” Smart Watch


 
We can ease your tech aches and pains.
The Kreyos Meteor is a hands-free, two-way communication system that you wear on your wrist. On your belt. On your bike. Or even on a lanyard around your neck.
Because it is light and portable, it’s easy to wear while on the move – whether you’re on a long bike ride or a short-trip to the grocery store.
For the first time ever, you now will have hands-free control over the powerhouse mini-computer that sits in your pocket.

 

UPDATE (01-JULY-2013): Kreyos Meteor has the ability to answer phone calls DIRECTLY from your wrist without reaching for your phone in the pocket. You can answer the call with a  gesture or by simply pressing the answer button on the watch. We added this update as many backers are confused whether they can answer calls from their wrist. 
Question: Does the Kreyos Meteor have a sim card slot?
A: No, your Kreyos needs to be connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth in order to answer calls. Its not meant to replace a smartphone.
Since the first time Captain Kirk spoke into his “communicator,” people have dreamed of using their voice to control communications.  As the only waterproof, interactive smartwatch to feature a microphone and speaker, the Kreyos Meteor is the first to allow you to control your smartphone – and your smartphone functions – remotely using voice commands.

 
 

UPDATE (28-JUNE-2013): Gestures controls could be configured in the free Kreyos App.
Wish you could send texts without typing? Or change your music without pressing a button?
Talking to your watch makes communication easy, but we also added motion control right into the Kreyos operating system. Using a 3-axis gyroscope, controlling your Kreyos Meteor Smart watch is as easy as moving your hand.

In the Meteor, four different wrist motions come preconfigured – and you can pick an action to correspond to specific activities. In the future, we’ll be adding a variety of additional motions to the Kreyos platform, enabling you to expand the motions in your repertoire. And developers also will have the freedom to build additional gestures into applications.
Because of its hands-free functionality, the Kreyos Meteor gives you more freedom to move around your world – without losing contact with your social, business and family networks.

UPDATE (28-JUNE-2013):  Kreyos Meteor can keep time even when disconnected from your phone. Kreyos Meteor also has inbuilt “widgets” that comes included. It works independently WITHOUT any smartphone connected.

Daily Activity Tracker
Calendar 
Countdown Timer
Sports Mode – Walking, Running & Cycling 
Multi World Clock
Analog Display
Digital Display
Multi Silent Vibrating Alarms


UPDATE (28-JUNE-2013): We will be setting up a platform for developers to upload watch faces. Uploaded watch faces will then be available directly on the Kreyos App for downloading and pushing updates to the watch instantly.
Customizing your watchface is easy.  The Meteor includes more than 20 digital and analog watch faces.  Change the look and feel of your watch whenever you feel like it.  Of course, 20 is just the beginning!  More to come in the future!


No two humans are alike. So why should everyone have to wear their smartwatch on their wrist? That’s why we created a series of watchbands and accessories designed to fit your lifestyle.
All of our watchbands and accessories are designed using high-grade, durable silicone. As a result, they are waterproof, flexible and fun to wear – whether you’re a couch potato, a fashionista, or a professional athlete! 
This season, we’re offering our watchbands and accessories in a series of “hot” colors perfect for those who are fashion forward:







Because you can wear it as a watch, hang it from your belt, attach it to your bike or wear it around your neck, the Kreyos Meteor frees you up to do the things you need to do – without worrying about dropping or losing your smartphone.  And it gives you the freedom to communicate – via voice, text, or email – even when holding a phone or tablet is inconvenient.
Watch for more fun, flexible accessories and colors in the future!  You’ll want to collect them all!

UPDATE (28-JUNE-2013): Kreyos Meteor has a built-in accelerometer. Daily Activity “widgets” is built into the watch, so it tracks stats like steps, floor climbs, calories and distance taken daily. You will be able to sync them into your smartphone’s app. This is standalone, works totally fine without your smartphone with you. It automatically syncs the data to your app when its near the smartphone.
Kreyos Meteor WILL WORK directly with bluetooth or ANT+ sensors without being connected to the smartphone. Meteor WILL BE ABLE to receive data directly from the sensors WITHOUT a smartphone connected and populate it on the watch.
Kreyos Meteor itself has a sports mode for people who wants to track when they start and stop activities like, Walking, Running & Cycling. It has a 3,4,5 grid data option, CUSTOMIZABLE in any way you prefer . 
Grid Options include the below:
 a) Total Workout time b) Time of the day c) Total Distance d) Altitude e) Elevation Gain f) Speed g) Average Speed h) Top Speed i) Pace j) Average Pace k) Calories Burned l) Current Heart Rate m) Average Heart Rate n) Max Heart Rate o) Current Lap Time p) Average Lap Time q) Best Lap Time
Question 1: Is Kreyos Meteor able to show running speed data in sports mode?
A: Yes, when a smartphone is NOT available, Kreyos uses metrics from the accelerometer and gyrometer and calculates your speed. In the event of a smartphone being available it will receive data from smartphone's GPS.
Question 2: Is Kreyos Meteor able to show Cycling speed data in sports mode independently?
A: No, for cycling it will require either a smartphone GPS data available or a ANT+/Bluetooth Speed cadence sensor to show speed data on the watch.
Question 3: Is Kreyos Meteor able to show Heart rate data in sports mode independently?
A: No, you will require a ANT+/Bluetooth Heart rate sensor for the watch to display the heart rate data.




Whatever your sport, the Kreyos Meteor will work for you.  Ever try and ride a horse with a smartphone?  Or race a dirt bike across country without breaking that expensive glass screen on your smartphone?  How about swimming in the ocean?

Or snorkeling offshore?  No matter what you love to do, the Kreyos Meteor will help you maintain your fitness, share your progress with friends and teammates, and shout your successes to the world…via social media!
 




Unlike the first-generation smartwatches that only provide one-way notifications, the Kreyos Meteor is the first and only interactive smartwatch to let you use voice and gestures to control your smartwatch.   Built into the operating system of the smartwatch itself, this technology is far beyond the capacities of the first-generation watches prepping for the market today.  In fact, voice and gesture control cannot be easily added to other watches because adding voice and gesture control requires hardware, rather than software, integration.
That means, quite simply, that the other “smartwatches” on the market won’t have full gesture and voice control capabilities for a long time --- if ever.
And that’s not all.  Because we already have our Kreyos Platform and proprietary operating system designed and developed, we are in the position of being able to get to market faster than anyone else.  In fact, we don’t need the money for development.  We need it for production.  And that means that as soon as we reach our target on Indiegogo, production begins.

And if you’re an early adopter now, you’ll be the first to hear about future upgrades to the Kreyos Smartwatch.  And you’ll be among the first to enjoy downloading new and exciting applications, programs and UI changes.  That’s right.  You won’t have to buy a new watch. You’ll update your watch online.  Simple.  Effective.  Powerful.
That’s the Kreyos Meteor.

UPDATE (28-JUNE-2013): Watch apps can be written in C. Also we will be creating an desktop emulator, making it easy for interested developers to create watch apps for the Kreyos Meteor.
If you're an app developer, click here to sign up for our developer's mailing list. We'll keep you in the loop for the latest SDK updates. 


Examples of potential apps that can be build using the Gyrometer.




Kreyos has tested, dropped, hit, dunked, tested again – and discovered that the Kreyos Meteor is ready for production.  A few of them are in the hands of select media for review, and we’re simply burning to turn on our production line. 
We expect to have our first batch ready for shipment in late November after we reach our Indiegogo goal. 
As a supporter, you will be among the first to receive your own Kreyos Meteor. So pledge today – and you’ll be enjoying the most advanced smartwatch on the market in time for the holidays.
 


Here are some actual sketches of the watch in the early phase. Also we have included some of the UI wireframe sketches of the watch. More to come...







We have completed most of our moulds required for injection parts. What you see in the pictures are ACTUAL injection samples, NOT PROTOTYPES made from 3D printers.  



To produce Kreyos Meteor we have chosen to work with one of the world's most respected factories in China. Our lead engineer, lives in Shanghai and travels back and forth to meet with our manufacturer. He is managing the project development with dedicated engineering resources supplied by our manufacturer.



Injection moulding tools at the manufacturing facilities below:









We need your help to finalize our software development and go into mass production.



Here is how we will invest the funding we receive:



1) Software Development: We have started the IOS, Android, WP8 software development but the majority of the funding requested will be applied to complete final software coding, testing and UI design.



2) Mass Production: We need your support to secure procurement of the long lead components and meet the minimum order quantities required by the EMS factories. 



With your support we expect to have the first production of Kreyos Meteor in your hands by late November, we want to get Kreyos Meteor to you before Christmas!. We are very excited about this project and hope you are too. We appreciate your support and please share Kreyos with your friends too!
The amount of funding we require to achieve the final milestones is $100,000. We hope you will find it in your heart to help us deliver this long sought after, valuable and useful technology.

Stretch Goals
UPDATE (01-JULY-2013): Our 1st Stretch Goal of $300,000!
Stretch Goal #1: Gamification Platform
The great thing about the Kreyos Meteor is that it’s interactive. We wanted to extend that and also make sure its fun and enjoyable at the same time for our users.
With your support it became a reality for Kreyos. We're very excited to announce our partnership with Badgeville (www.Badgeville.com), the leader in gamification platform. This allow us to provide our users with the best gamification experience possible. With the integration our users would be able enjoy the following below in the members community area and also on the Kreyos App.


Social: Share your achievements with your friends

Motivation: Activities earn you points, badges and achievements!

Fun: Make fitness fun! Share & compete with your friends.

Tracking: Set goals! Track your progress with your Kreyos Meteor by simply syncing your stats wirelessly to your Kreyos app.

UPDATE (11-JULY-2013):  Our 2nd Stretch Goal of $600,000!
Stretch Goal #2: Two Free Screen Protectors
All Indiegogo backers will receive TWO FREE Screen Protectors with their purchase of the Kreyos Meteor. Yes, you’ve heard us correctly, not one but TWO! Even though our screen is already scratch resistant, it wouldn’t hurt having an extra layer of protective skin on it.
UPDATE (27-JULY-2013):  Our 3rd Stretch Goal of $1000,000!
Stretch Goal #3: Sleep Tracking


Stretch Goal #4: $1.5Million.... 
Announcing our new stretch goal at $1.5Million
Our team will build a new app for iOS, Android & WP8 which allow Meteor users to use gestures to control applications on Windows and Apple computers. Once the Meteor is connected via bluetooth to the computer, the user can use gestures to control applications such as Powerpoint during a presentation, i.e: previous slide, next slide and so on. More applications will be coming soon. If we do hit this goal, we will have this app ready 3-4months after we delivery the Kreyos Meteor.

<h3><strong>LotusMudra - clothes and more!   -  a short introduction...</strong></h3>
We design clothes for Yoga, Qi Gong, Meditation and other practices in high quality pure organic cotton of an individual design. Up to this point we have found partners with the same awareness to produce clothes in an ecological and sustainable way + which we would like to support in exchange! </div>
<div>Our 'two-way' - project is ready to launch! </div>
<div>We would like to be able to make our first order at the manufacturers in a minimum quantity required and therefore ask you to support us in sharing this project or backing our order list!<br/>Our e-shop is ready but not active yet!!<br/>See more details under: <a href=""http://www.lotusmudra.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lotusmudra.com</a> or</div>

<h3>more details about the project:</h3>
is my label for clothes for workout or exercise like Yoga, Qi Gong, Tai Ji or Meditation or any other practice, but also for every day use. Our clothes are made of pure cotton and 100% ecological and with an ethical correct production line. Let me tell you in a few words how this project was born. I am a stage- and costume designer and in 2010 I finishes my TT as a Yoga teacher in China. I found out quiet quickly that wearing these t-shirt jogging clothes while exercising was not comfortable enough, I did not like the cloth sticking on my skin and the deformation of the clothes either. I wanted something with a loose fitting, simple classical cuts but still individual so that I could even step out of the Yoga center and have a cup of something without hoping anyone to see me…. We Yogis do also like pure white clothes with no logos, stripes or anything else on it, pure white as it stands for purity, divinity, spirituality….. So as a costume designer I started to design my own clothes and soon people asked me where I had bought these clothes. The idea to confectionate was born! I made a big research where and how to produce my fabrics, I searched in France, Germany, China and India… walked on cotton fields, through villages, manufactories and finally found the partners with the same ethical consciousness than my brand. Last winter I spent in Amritsar accompanying the realization of the samples which are done now, I designed 26 different models for both man and women and in two colors. So far I was supported by my friends and the money I had still on my account. I created an e-shop, realized by a webmaster of course, a photographer which worked for free and many friends which supported me, but now I am at the point of the first order and therefore I need your help!<br/>On this way I met many interesting people and projects which I would like to work with and support in exchange. I'll introduce 2 of them to you a bit further down in the text!</div>

<h3>who we are:</h3>
<p>I am a 45 year old stage- and costume designer and also a Kundalini Yoga Teacher.   I was born in Munich, Germany, but for 6 years I have lived in a small village in southern France. LotusMudra is my first Label and the white and indigo cotton garments my first collection.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/742631/pictures/full/20130406064933-LotusMudra_Logo_Kopie.jpg?1365256180"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
My second collection, made from cashmere, is in preparation!</div>
<div>
<br/>Of course all this is not possible to realize alone, so we became a small team of photographers, web-designer, teachers, travel guides, weavers, tailors etc who will all have a 'portrait' and will be introduced on my website!!</div>
<div>
<br/>Eco design begins when designing, but we also take our ethical and social responsibility very seriously. Therefore we try to make all working processes and conditions transparent and work together with manufacturers who work with the same awareness to make ecological and sustainable products.<br/><h3>where the money goes:</h3>
<p>If you want an idea come alive it needs more than a good idea, energy and friends who help you! If you want constant quality of your product you can not just ask your tailor around the corner. Fabrics woven and stitched after your ideas need a minimum order-quantity, otherwise it is not possible for manufacturers to produce effectivly. I found a middle sized company in India which does only organic cotton and started some 10 years ago like me with a dream! They offered me a first very small minimum order-quantity, because they believe in this collection!</p>
<p>Weaving, stichting, shipping costs and taxes is where the money, your money would be invested in - and for every Euro more we could afford to launch a publicity campaign and make work more people on the presentation of LotusMudra!</p>
<p>See where else the money goes.....</p>
<h3>projects we support:</h3>
During my research into who really works with organic cotton, I came across some really special people and projects!<br/><br/>With 2 of them I would like to continue to work together and so support each other.<br/><br/>The first project is the ""Women Weave Charitable Trust"" situated in Maheshwar, India. This is a project founded in 2003, supporting the role of women in handloom weaving and working towards making handloom a profitable, fulfilling, sustainable and dignified income-earning activity.<br/><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/742628/pictures/cubepeep/20130406064744-WomenWeave_logo.png?1365256070"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.womenweave.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.womenweave.org/</a></p>
<p>You will be able to see their work and their products will be available in our e-shop...</p>
<p> </p>
The second project we would like to support directly, is the creation of a Yoga-School with attached Niwas (accommodation) in Amritsar. They have already bought the ground and the construction plans are ready, so the project is ready for take-off! From every item we sell, 5% will go directly into the trust of Parvinder Singh Khalsa from ""SikhKaras"", who is already supporting weavers, schools and many small projects in and around Amritsar. You will be able to follow the project on our blog!<br/><a href=""http://www.sikhkaras.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sikhkaras.com/</a><br/>I've been there myself and saw how much they have achieved....<br/><p>You can find some pics on my blog under: <a href=""http://www.lotusmudrafollow.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.lotusmudrafollow.wordpress.com</a></p>

Soft, durable, and functional, Infinitude Clothing will surround the wearer with chic, all-over comfort.

These will positively impact hospitals, medical centers, doctors' and dentists' offices in creating a more professional, productive and most importantly, a healthier environment for everyone. The soft and flexible fabric has been specially selected to complement the subtle details of the design and deliver a flawless fit.</p>
<h1>INFINITUDE powered by X-Static®</h1>
<p>Infinitude Clothing has partnered with Noble Biomaterials to power its fabrics with clinically-proven X-STATIC® antimicrobial technology. Proven to extremes by Olympic athletes, US Special Forces and luxury athletic brands like LULULEMON®, X-STATIC® delivers unmatched protection and performance. Made with 99.9% pure silver, X-STATIC® enhances these products with permanent anti-odor and antimicrobial performance. X-STATIC® also has natural temperature regulating properties to keep you performing at your best, which also means being the most comfortable while still looking fabulous. Fabrics powered by X-STATIC® inhibit the growth of bacteria directly on the surface of the fabric. Through the continuous release of silver ions, it offers permanent protection that lasts for the life of the product. Continuous protection is provided for patients and staff between launderings and since it's inherent in the fabric, does not require modification in staff behavior. This leading-edge technology offers extensive appeal for Infinitude Clothing since it provides customers with the benefit of empowering them to fight and prevent bacterial contamination of medical apparel. We believe our complete line including premium medical scrubs, surgical hats/caps, white coats and stethoscope covers will serve as the first-of-its-kind in the battle against healthcare associated infections (HAIs).</p>
<p>X-STATIC® is registered as an antimicrobial with the US EPA, is Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified and is used in dozens of FDA approved products.*</p>
<p>Healthcare associated infections are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Approximately 1 out of every 20 hospitalized patients will contract an HAI causing approximately 99,000 deaths and costing the healthcare system billions of dollars annually.1</p>
<p>Dr. Gil Ortega, a board-certified orthopedic trauma surgeon and serial entrepreneur, founded Infinitude Clothing. Throughout his career in healthcare, Dr. Ortega has developed an in-depth and intimate knowledge of the healthcare industry. Dr. Ortega has a passion for improving healthcare in every way he can to ensure patients always receive the best and most efficient healthcare. Infinitude Clothing is excited to begin the revolution in upgrading the standard of medical apparel.</p>

<h1>What Stage are we at now?</h1>
<p>We have all our designs, our website is ready, our cutter and sewers are ready, our distribution line is ready, our social media campaign is ready, and we are ready.  So why do we need a Indiegogo project?  We want to launch our product line with all the awesome fabrics, designs, and coolness that the healthcare field deserves.  We need funding to help us buy all the Silver. Well, not quite the silver, but the power behind our fabrics of X-Static® Antimicrobial Technology that will protect patients, hospitals, and healthcare workers from the bacterial badness that led to way too many HAIs.  </p>
<p>Seriously though, we do need the money to help cover the production costs of the fabrics (we want to include as many colors as we can to help our customers have more color choices), as well as the fixed and variable costs of having our product line cut and sewn in the USA.   Did we mention that we are very proud to cut and sew our medical apparel line right here in the USA!  We want our company to help bring more jobs back to our great country.</p>

</div></div>","About Us
Infinitude Clothing™ is revolutionizing the world of medical apparel.  We will bring our customers “Premium medical apparel with a Purpose™.”  We will “Bring the White Coat Back,™” and we are dedicated to providing the healthcare industry with the medical apparel it has long deserved.
Infinitude Clothing is taking professional medical apparel to the next level of wearable technology. The line will be a perfect blend of trend-setting style, quality and comfort that will cater to customers who desire finer quality apparel and the polished look it produces. Soft, durable, and functional, Infinitude Clothing will surround the wearer with chic, all-over comfort. The brand will offer distinctive scrubs in both off the shelf designs in an array of colors as well as a wide range of custom made-to-order individualized designs. These will positively impact hospitals, medical centers, doctors' and dentists' offices in creating a more professional, productive and most importantly, a healthier environment for everyone. The soft and flexible fabric has been specially selected to complement the subtle details of the design and deliver a flawless fit.
INFINITUDE powered by X-Static®
Infinitude Clothing has partnered with Noble Biomaterials to power its fabrics with clinically-proven X-STATIC® antimicrobial technology. Proven to extremes by Olympic athletes, US Special Forces and luxury athletic brands like LULULEMON®, X-STATIC® delivers unmatched protection and performance. Made with 99.9% pure silver, X-STATIC® enhances these products with permanent anti-odor and antimicrobial performance. X-STATIC® also has natural temperature regulating properties to keep you performing at your best, which also means being the most comfortable while still looking fabulous. Fabrics powered by X-STATIC® inhibit the growth of bacteria directly on the surface of the fabric. Through the continuous release of silver ions, it offers permanent protection that lasts for the life of the product. Continuous protection is provided for patients and staff between launderings and since it's inherent in the fabric, does not require modification in staff behavior. This leading-edge technology offers extensive appeal for Infinitude Clothing since it provides customers with the benefit of empowering them to fight and prevent bacterial contamination of medical apparel. We believe our complete line including premium medical scrubs, surgical hats/caps, white coats and stethoscope covers will serve as the first-of-its-kind in the battle against healthcare associated infections (HAIs).
X-STATIC® is registered as an antimicrobial with the US EPA, is Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified and is used in dozens of FDA approved products.*
Healthcare associated infections are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Approximately 1 out of every 20 hospitalized patients will contract an HAI causing approximately 99,000 deaths and costing the healthcare system billions of dollars annually.1
Dr. Gil Ortega, a board-certified orthopedic trauma surgeon and serial entrepreneur, founded Infinitude Clothing. Throughout his career in healthcare, Dr. Ortega has developed an in-depth and intimate knowledge of the healthcare industry. Dr. Ortega has a passion for improving healthcare in every way he can to ensure patients always receive the best and most efficient healthcare. Infinitude Clothing is excited to begin the revolution in upgrading the standard of medical apparel.

What Stage are we at now?
We have all our designs, our website is ready, our cutter and sewers are ready, our distribution line is ready, our social media campaign is ready, and we are ready.  So why do we need a Indiegogo project?  We want to launch our product line with all the awesome fabrics, designs, and coolness that the healthcare field deserves.  We need funding to help us buy all the Silver. Well, not quite the silver, but the power behind our fabrics of X-Static® Antimicrobial Technology that will protect patients, hospitals, and healthcare workers from the bacterial badness that led to way too many HAIs.  
Seriously though, we do need the money to help cover the production costs of the fabrics (we want to include as many colors as we can to help our customers have more color choices), as well as the fixed and variable costs of having our product line cut and sewn in the USA.   Did we mention that we are very proud to cut and sew our medical apparel line right here in the USA!  We want our company to help bring more jobs back to our great country.

<p>Law enforcement officials in the line of duty will typically prefer to carry a back-up weapon that would be smaller, lighter and more concealed than the department issued main weapon.The concealment of such back-up weapons would either require a vest which would be worn under the uniform shirt thus requiring the shirt to be opened before effectively retrieving the weapon or as a holster worn on the ankle, either around a boot or sock. The ankle holsters on the market today are typically comprised of a fabric holster and Velcro straps requiring the straps to be tightened and re-tightened several times in order to ensure the security of the weapon. Additionally, the currently available ankle holsters are typically bulky and uncomfortable for the officers, resulting in the choice to not carry back-up weapons at all. In order to properly secure the holster to the boot and avoid slippage, it is more effective to have the holster lace directly onto the existing boot as an overlay making it as one with the upper of the boot. Along with the benefit to police officers, as many states are adopting Right to Carry Laws, this ankle holster would enable citizens with a CHL (Concealed Handgun License) to exercise their right carry, for their personal protection, while effectively concealing from public view.</p>
<p>This unique and exceptional design of this holster securely laces the base to the upper ankle portion of the boot by the eyelets that match up with the eyelets of the wearers boot and with a gap that matches up with the gap of the boot, essentially making it one complete piece.  The base also supports changeable, custom formed holders for additional items such as telescoping batons, pepper spray, flares, cell phones and other items.  Each base/holster is custom made based upon specific boot model/style and the back-up weapon carried.</p>
<p>We have an option for boots with side zippers too!  At the end of the day when your feet are tired and the first thing you want to do is kick your boots off, just unsnap and unzip, no need to unlace or alter the boot in any way.  A security strap can also be added upon request. </p>

</div></div>","Our MEN IN BLUE deserve a more comfortable, secure option for concealing back-up weapons on their ankles. 
Law enforcement officials in the line of duty will typically prefer to carry a back-up weapon that would be smaller, lighter and more concealed than the department issued main weapon.The concealment of such back-up weapons would either require a vest which would be worn under the uniform shirt thus requiring the shirt to be opened before effectively retrieving the weapon or as a holster worn on the ankle, either around a boot or sock. The ankle holsters on the market today are typically comprised of a fabric holster and Velcro straps requiring the straps to be tightened and re-tightened several times in order to ensure the security of the weapon. Additionally, the currently available ankle holsters are typically bulky and uncomfortable for the officers, resulting in the choice to not carry back-up weapons at all. In order to properly secure the holster to the boot and avoid slippage, it is more effective to have the holster lace directly onto the existing boot as an overlay making it as one with the upper of the boot. Along with the benefit to police officers, as many states are adopting Right to Carry Laws, this ankle holster would enable citizens with a CHL (Concealed Handgun License) to exercise their right carry, for their personal protection, while effectively concealing from public view.
This unique and exceptional design of this holster securely laces the base to the upper ankle portion of the boot by the eyelets that match up with the eyelets of the wearers boot and with a gap that matches up with the gap of the boot, essentially making it one complete piece.  The base also supports changeable, custom formed holders for additional items such as telescoping batons, pepper spray, flares, cell phones and other items.  Each base/holster is custom made based upon specific boot model/style and the back-up weapon carried.
We have an option for boots with side zippers too!  At the end of the day when your feet are tired and the first thing you want to do is kick your boots off, just unsnap and unzip, no need to unlace or alter the boot in any way.  A security strap can also be added upon request.

Competition is the key to breaking records. The IronCloud features an innovative Virtual Opponent to help motivate you to run faster and keep pace. Set the speed you want it to run alongside you, and you're off to the races!   The IronCloud features a variety of sport modes for your favorite indoor or outdoor activities. Included with the IronCloud:

With each of these sports modes you can monitor and track various metrics including physiological metrics, running dynamics, and fitness tracking features to ensure you’re staying on top of your goals. We are hard at work integrating new sport modes that will be available via software updates in the future. Your heartbeat can tell a lot about your activity levels. The IronCloud features a wrist-based Valencell heart rate sensor allowing you to track your day-to-day heart rate along with your activity levels during exercise. An intelligent watch requires an intelligent app. The IronCloud pairs seamlessly with the Geekery Fitmix iOS and Android app to allow users to monitor their performance, watch workout tutorials, connect with other users and even listen to music.Using the app is easy, and allows for a hassle-free way to change the IronCloud’s settings, check progress reports, and create customized training programs. To get the most out of your workout, elevating your heart beat at a consistent pace is essential. The Training Zone will allow you to maximize your results by carefully matching your personal goals to the appropriate Training Zone.There are five different Training Zones:Whatever your goals are for any given workout, ensure that your heart rate is up to speed.   Stay on top of your daily performance and goals with the IronCloud. The IronCloud will track and monitor your:Additionally, you can set Target Steps and Target Calories and receive a notification whenever you meet your goal.The IronCloud also sends an alert every 45 minutes to remind wearers to stand up and stretch and walk around to help combat the adverse effects of prolonged sitting.Energy Saver Mode:  Up to 50 Days.Time Mode:  Up to 30 Days.Sports/GPS Mode:  Up to 30 Hours.In a world of smartwatches that continuously need to be recharged, the IronCloud offers a solution. What good is a watch that drains the battery even when just displaying the time? It defeats the purpose. That's why the IronCloud sports a 480mah lithium battery that provides 50 days of battery life in time mode. Additionally, we integrated intelligent power-saving technology into both the hardware and software to help save power automatically. The IronCloud is meant for all sports—even the wet ones. The IronCloud is water resistant up to 100 meters (10 ATM) which makes it safe for most water sports including swimming, snorkeling, and boat racing. Additionally, you can lock the touch screen while in the water, so you don't run into any accidental taps or swipes.If you aren't into water sports, no problem—the IronCloud is still safe for regular use including handwashing, rain, and accidental spills.Must-haves for all of your outdoor adventures, the IronCloud features state-of-the-art tools to help you better understand the world around you. Built into the IronCloud are a compass, barometer, and altimeter. The watch also features a highly-accurate stopwatch for timing your next run or workout down to the millisecond. Always know where you are in the world with the built-in Triple Navigation System. This system is comprised of BDS from China, GPS from the U.S. and GLONASS from Russia.  Always stay ready for any weather changes that may come your way. Via the Bluetooth connection to your smartphone, the IronCloud allows users to check local weather forecasts to stay in the know.Stronger than traditional glass and used in premium watches for years, the IronCloud's sapphire crystal screen is built to withstand harsh environments and common everyday bumps and scratches. The sapphire crystal is stronger than traditional glass, making it the least prone to shattering and scratching of all materials used in watches. The IronCloud's bezel is made of the same TC4 titanium they use to build rockets. If it's tough enough for the harsh conditions of space, it’s more than durable enough for your even most intense workouts outdoors, in the ocean, or harsh environments. TC4 is also hyper-allergenic and is suitable for prolonged exposure to the skin. Say goodbye to glare! Transflective displays like the one found in the IronCloud both transmit and reflect light, which virtually eliminates the need for a backlight under sunny conditions which in turn saves tremendous amounts of energy. Quickly check the time, track your progress, or view notifications under even the brightest conditions such as direct sunlight. IronCloud comes with the TPU band which is perfect for everyday wear and can withstand water and harsh UV rays. It’s super comfortable, made with lightweight, silky smooth material, and perfect for exercising.Want another band? Just upgrade your perk to the Elite Edition and you will get both a TPU band and a stainless-still band.The stainless-steel band is more professional and is made of robust components to stay looking sharp and clean for years.Both bands are easily interchangeable in seconds to adjust to your look on the fly.  Screwdrivers are also included in the Elite Edition.   Pair the IronCloud with your compatible smartphone, and you'll be able to see all of your notifications right on your wrist! Whenever someone texts, calls, or emails you, stay updated instantly! The watch will also notify you of any weather reports or upcoming events on your calendar as well.While some companies think that one watch face fits all, the IronCloud allows users to customize the watch face to match their unique style and aesthetic. From flashy to minimal designs, everyone is bound to find a watch face that fits their needs.       We will announce the color based on the result of the survey by next Friday.

<p><strong>Hi folks! We are Catherine &amp; Angtak from the social enterprise We are KAL.</strong><br/>We met through our shared passion for wool from the nomadic region Kharnak in the Himalayas, in Ladakh, India.</p>
<p>For 5 years we have been working on this unique wool from the land where Angtak spent his childhood and his family still keeps animals. Yak wool, sheep wool and lambswool which grow on the animals at altitudes of 4000m – 5000m!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559199298/wbj4t6r7ytj66fvyhhpn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Since 2014 we have created a global community around our wool with our characteristic hand-spun and handwoven accessories, home textiles, yarn and garments.  <br/>Every summer we source yak wool, sheep wool and lambswool from the small community of Angtak's native place.  <br/><br/>However, in order to process the wool we have been travelling across the Himalayas for many days to bring our wool for professional carding to the neighbouring state Himachal Pradesh. This extra effort is due to the lack of suitable machines in the isolated region Ladakh. </p>
<p><strong>We would now like to step up our game and set up our own wool unit in Ladakh, India and are raising 15000€ for this goal.</strong></p>
<p>The processing is an important step in the making of finest woollen textiles as it removes the coarse hair of the animals. <strong>Our focus is and will always be on hand-spun and handwoven textiles. With these machines we are not replacing any of the precious hand-craft of this region.

THE WORLD'S MOST COMFORTABLE SOLE
Encapsulated within the Townie are over 2,000 stacked honeycomb spring units that are 3D printed into the sole with our patent pending 3D print process. This unique sole structure, that cannot be made with any other manufacturing method, gives you a healthy spring in your step like you've never before experienced.

OESH IS ALREADY SHIPPING THE TOWNIES…
AND THIS IS WHAT OESHERS ARE SAYING!
 
""They're sexy!”
-Mary in Minneapolis, MN
 
""THEY STAY ON!""
-Lucie in Albemarle County, VA
 
""The new flat I just received is exceptionally comfortable. The thicker sole is so goooddd for my feet and they stay on and no slippage. Wanting you to know this new design is like no other flat I have had with your exquisite sole.""
-Linda in Boys Town, NE 
 
2,000 STACKED HONEYCOMB SPRINGS
 
DELIVER THE TOWNIE'S HEALTHY BOUNCE  
STAYS SECURE AND MOVES WITH YOU
A unique grippy soft-touch 3D printed heel piece keeps the Townie secure on your foot.

Unlike a typical d'Orsay dress flat, the stretchy knit upper and the grippy flexible heel piece work together to keep the flat secure on your foot.


EASY SLIP-ON 

All you have to do to get going in your Townies is step right in.
GET TO KNOW THE TOWNIE FLAT


The Townie flat by OESH combines an impossibly springy 3D printed sole with unbeatable traction, a grippy soft-touch 3D printed heel piece that stays put, a breathable stretchy cotton knit upper that molds naturally to the shape of your foot, and a beautiful hand crochet finish. 


MADE DIFFERENTLY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE
Not only are the Townies you receive 100% made in Charlottesville, so are the 3D printers used to manufacture them. With your support, we are creating exciting new opportunities in STEM as we build additional 3D printers, purchase and program additional computerized knitting machines, and build out clean, high tech factory space as OESH keeps growing.

Everybody’s teeth and palate are different, and using PomaBrush doesn’t mean you need to change your favorite toothpaste!Whether you like strawberry flavored Colgate or fresh and minty Sensodyne, PomaBrush’s vibrations will clean thoroughly and evenly.   Certified By 
PomaBrush's factory has been reviewed and approved by all relevant agencies, including the FDA, and the European Union’s RoHS and CE.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the USA’s government agency responsible for protecting public health.

Form Follows Function    PomaBrush captures the essence of minimalist toothbrush design — less is more.  No Wi-Fi. No AI. No Bluetooth. And none of those extra bells and whistles you’ll never use.This means it’s 5x lighter, and 20% smaller than its competitors. And not even 3x heavier than a non-electric toothbrush!    
Enjoy Painless Deep Cleaning   PomaBrush has 15,000 brush strokes per minute to gently pulse water between your teeth, breaking up plaque and sweeping it away. Thanks to its consistent power delivery the brush removes more plaque and tartar from the teeth and gums. And is effective to reduce the gingivitis.PomaBrush provides a comprehensive cleaning with its silicone bristles and is gentle enough for even sensitive teeth and gums. And thanks to its soft silicone bristles you don’t need to worry about hurting your gums, even if you brush more than 2 times a day.PomaBrush automatically buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know you should switch to the next quarter. And turns off after the recommended 2 minutes. Use Your Silicone Brush For Longer     Silicone is far more durable than nylon, meaning your brush head wears out much slower.  Thanks to this conscious toothbrush design, you only need to change your brush heads once every 6 months.And at this time, you’ll know your PomaBrush is always clean. With silicone’s naturally antimicrobial properties, germs don’t accumulate on the brush head or brush.    Clean Better with PomaBrush PomaBrush’s powerful sonic vibrations dislodge plaque that builds on and between your teeth. And stimulate the salivary glands, which assists with cleaning.PomaBrush’s silicone bristles clean gently yet thoroughly. Thanks to this, they offer extra protection against gingivitis while massaging and activating your gums.With its in-built 2-minute timer and 30-second reminders to change brushing areas, PomaBrush promotes the correct tooth brushing habits recommended by dentists worldwide.This helps decrease the chances of oral health conditions, including plaque and gum diseases.  
 Built To Get Wet   Use it in the shower, or even in the tub! PomaBrush is 100% waterproof, certified to IPX7. Take it with you wherever you go

Premium Carbon Edition PomaBrush
The exclusive edition that takes the sleekness of the Black Mist PomaBrush and continues it outwards, wrapping your PomaCase in a futuristic black sheen.    Product Specificifications    Designing the Ultimate PomaBrushWe spent years wading through the market looking for the best electric toothbrush that would meet our lifestyle and dental routine. One you could use with ease, then slide in your backpack, handbag or luggage, and carry with you everywhere.    All we found instead were $200 giant electric toothbrushes with 5 different buttons and brush heads oscillating at impressive 50,000 pulses that literally cut my sensitive gums.  So we created PomaBrush. A product of collaboration between the best-in-class American engineering and premium Italian design that focused on the core — creating the best electric toothbrush.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We create uniquely designed and eco-friendly parasols made from paper &amp; bamboo, working in collaboration with Mexican artists and inspired by the world around us. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Story </h3>
<p>Whether walking around the city or strolling on the sandy beaches, we have seen people from all walks of life carrying umbrellas to protect themselves from the sun. While your standard umbrella may protect you from the sun, it also traps heat, which is where our parasol idea came into being. What if someone offered parasols that not only served their purpose but were also beautiful and told a story, and what if that story was modernized to reflect the rich past and present of Mexico. We sprang into action and through collaboration with Mexican artist Ariadna Narvaez, ParaSol was born. </p>
<p>We will begin our focus on wholesale distribution in high-impact touristic areas: Heritage sites, Playa del Carmen, Cancun, Mexico City and Cabo San Lucas. </p>
<h3>We Believe</h3>
<p><strong>​1. Style</strong></p>
<p>In the last decade, Mexico has established itself as a fostering environment and stage for innovative artists, designers and fashion entrepreneurs . Today's Mexico is on the cutting-edge and many have uniquely blended their art into a new brand of traditional Mexican culture and the Millennial. However, globally, the narrative has not changed, especially in areas where tourists frequent most, and are still limited to an array of cacti and sombreros. We believe in pushing the narrative into the future by utilizing that blend and offering it in a new, unique product for visitors to Mexico and Mexicans alike! </p>
<p><strong>2. Low Environmental Impact</strong></p>
<p>It's just plain silly that we would even have to explain, so we're not going to. </p>
<p><strong>3. Social Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>In a country where there is just as much disadvantage as advantage, it is important to give back and support the community. Many organizations here are focused on helping bring change and equal opportunities to all, but they need help. That is why we are working with Weavers for Justice, a volunteer-based NGO working with Mayan weaving women's cooperatives in Chiapas. In addition to philanthropy, we are supporting their efforts by raising awareness, fundraising and much more! </p>

Today we're introducing to you the project of our lives – the CONTEMPUS watch series!""CONTEMPUS"" is a name derived from two words which sum up the idea perfectly - ""contemporary"" and ""tempus"", which is the Latin word for its majesty, Time itself.We create aesthetically-designed timepieces in a contemporary manner, drawing inspiration from the works of the most prominent modern craftsmen of our time.We find the idea of combining various wristwatch designs with some details which define popular design styles and features to be more interesting.Summing it up, we decided to create a watch series inspired by famous cultural architecture and design phenomena, icons, and standards, so here's our first try. Hope you'll like it!  Du Stalo is a special limited edition of our main series. Here are some of its features:
Stylish monochrome coloration with an ashen leather strap 
Shiny new dial made of brushed stainless steel 
Special edition for KS backers with a serial number on each piece
100 pcs. only available
Please note that Super Early Bird offers don't include this watch, it's available only in DU STALO REWARD, but it can be included in packages with 2, 3, 4 or more watches.The main concept of our design is a neat, contemporary outlook stripped of unnecessary visual garbage. Our project is an ode to the masters of the past, present and future: those, who move the industry of aesthetic objective beauty to new heights.In each series, every watch will be developed under the influence of the jewels of contemporary design which surrounds us all over the world.

But this story starts way down in the southern hemisphere, in my home country, Aotearoa New Zealand. I was back Downunder for a month in 2016, and the underwear I'd packed were starting to look like they needed replacing. And when a man admits they need replacing, you know the situation is quite dire.</p><p>I headed out shopping, and I was not impressed with what I found. Thick chunky stitching (chafe!), middle seams that ride up, fabrics that irritate and patterns so dull they looked like they'd been designed by Eeyore using Microsoft Word.</p><p>This wasn't a new problem, but I'd finally had enough.

Men have grown to accept that poorly-made, boring, uncomfortable undies are the norm. I'm Asher, I live in London. But this story starts way down in the southern hemisphere, in my home country, Aotearoa New Zealand. I was back Downunder for a month in 2016, and the underwear I'd packed were starting to look like they needed replacing. And when a man admits they need replacing, you know the situation is quite dire.I headed out shopping, and I was not impressed with what I found. Thick chunky stitching (chafe!), middle seams that ride up, fabrics that irritate and patterns so dull they looked like they'd been designed by Eeyore using Microsoft Word.This wasn't a new problem, but I'd finally had enough. I just knew I could create something better. So I did just that.I'm not a fashion designer, I'm not a quick-talking serial entrepreneur. I'm just a guy who was sick and tired of chafe, of sweaty cotton, of underwear that climbed up my backside. I was sick of paying for a product that I knew was rubbish.

<b>Why Watches?</b><b style=""font-size: 16px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></b>
</h2>
<p>Sometimes something is more than it appears. This watch, for example, is more than just a watch. It is the means to a much larger end. It isn’t just something you wear, but a goal to improve the lives of all those with whom you come in contact. It is meant to be a reminder, a symbol of the power of charitable thought. Building a watch was an intentional choice because it is so visible. Other people will admire your watch and ask you about it, and we hope that each time you will look down and remember that you helped someone. If you are running late, going to a meeting, or rushing to get to a movie on time you will check your watch, and each time you see your GiVE watch we hope you will in turn remember to think how you can ""GiVE your time"" to the people around you despite your busy schedule.</p>

<p>The innovative idea behind our GiVING back program is unique. It's different than how most companies give back.

But what if you're not particularly passionate about giving glasses to someone? What if you had a family member that had cancer?<br/></p>

</div></div>","It's time to GiVE more:



We built this brand on the principle that quality does not have to be expensive. That passion to make a better product is more important than costly marketing and inflated popular name brands. We wanted to make a luxury watch but without the middleman, fancy branding, and costly marketing schemes. After hundreds of hours researching which features you want in a watch, what design was going to be the most meaningful, and more efficient manufacturing techniques; the GiVE watch was born. What resulted was a simple, elegant watch that replaces the ludicrously expensive name brand watches in both quality and price. 
Buying from GiVE vs. Others:










Why Watches?

Sometimes something is more than it appears. This watch, for example, is more than just a watch. It is the means to a much larger end. It isn’t just something you wear, but a goal to improve the lives of all those with whom you come in contact. It is meant to be a reminder, a symbol of the power of charitable thought. Building a watch was an intentional choice because it is so visible. Other people will admire your watch and ask you about it, and we hope that each time you will look down and remember that you helped someone. If you are running late, going to a meeting, or rushing to get to a movie on time you will check your watch, and each time you see your GiVE watch we hope you will in turn remember to think how you can ""GiVE your time"" to the people around you despite your busy schedule.


Not just a pretty face: 


Wherever life takes you, whether it is a fancy dinner or backpacking in the mountains, you can be confident your GiVE watch won’t let you down. GiVE watches are a perfect blend of elegance and durability .

at the age of 17 years old while attending high school.  A few years prior
at only the age of 15, Adam was influenced by the action sports scene and more
specifically the clothing industry and design.  He  always wanted to
wear the the latest and greatest threads from the brands that he loved. 
Adam was given the opportunity to design a t-shirt for a local skate shop to
sell in their store as the ""official"" shop tee.  From that day
on, Adam was extremely interested in graphic design and began messing around on
the computer more often because he realized he had a knack for art.  It
wasn’t until late 2008 that Adam had decided to put all of his designs into
motion and create a brand that represented his action sports lifestyle. 
Starting off a little rocky with the official know-how of marketing a brand,
Adam took his clothing line to his entire high school and sold out of his first
t-shirt design in days.  It was at that point Adam knew this was something
he wanted to do for the rest of his life.  It was his passion and he was
extremely dedicated to accomplish what he was working for...Amped Apparel.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>

forwarding into the future... Coming up on only five short years of existence, Amped
has grown to the national level including a website for fans across the country
to purchase from.  For quite some time, Adam was doing research and design
in a new area that was of much interest to him and that idea was eyewear.  He released his first set of eyewear in the Summer of 2012 and with
much surprise, the release went over extremely well and sunglasses were flying
off of the shelves daily.  Over the next year, Adam developed additional
colors and added another new style to the line up.  The eyewear line
evolved into a large focus for the brand with endless routes to travel.</span></p>

Komen.  Here is your chance to wear a great brand and also help out an amazing organization at the same time!









Amped Apparel was started by Adam Sinz
at the age of 17 years old while attending high school.  A few years prior
at only the age of 15, Adam was influenced by the action sports scene and more
specifically the clothing industry and design.  He  always wanted to
wear the the latest and greatest threads from the brands that he loved. 
Adam was given the opportunity to design a t-shirt for a local skate shop to
sell in their store as the ""official"" shop tee.  From that day
on, Adam was extremely interested in graphic design and began messing around on
the computer more often because he realized he had a knack for art.  It
wasn’t until late 2008 that Adam had decided to put all of his designs into
motion and create a brand that represented his action sports lifestyle. 
Starting off a little rocky with the official know-how of marketing a brand,
Adam took his clothing line to his entire high school and sold out of his first
t-shirt design in days.  It was at that point Adam knew this was something
he wanted to do for the rest of his life.  It was his passion and he was
extremely dedicated to accomplish what he was working for...Amped Apparel.



            Fast
forwarding into the future... Coming up on only five short years of existence, Amped
has grown to the national level including a website for fans across the country
to purchase from.  For quite some time, Adam was doing research and design
in a new area that was of much interest to him and that idea was eyewear.  He released his first set of eyewear in the Summer of 2012 and with
much surprise, the release went over extremely well and sunglasses were flying
off of the shelves daily.  Over the next year, Adam developed additional
colors and added another new style to the line up.  The eyewear line
evolved into a large focus for the brand with endless routes to travel.
     Adam needs your help to complete his journey in creating the next extension of what will be known as Amped Optics.  As many people can understand, launching a brand into the market place requires a large capital investment.  Your pledge will go towards research and design, production, and marketing and advertising.  We want to get these on shelves at a retailer near you.  We have met and located the manufacturing companies that we want to work with but we need your help.  Every contribution small or large will help Adam proceed though the design and developmental stages of launching a brand that will allow people to see the world differently.  So please, pledge now and be amount one of the first people in the world to be rocking a sleek, new, affordable, and attractive premium eyewear brand.            

 Your pledge today will get you a pair(s) of our newest, most anticipated eyewear yet; The Emils Series.  Choose between black on black, brown with gold trim, or midnight blue with rose lens.  Properly branded at 4 locations, you are bound to attract some attention.  The Emils come equipped with UV400 protected lenses to shades your eyes from the most harmful rays.















































Each year Amped Apparel gives back to the community by working hand in hand with cancer foundations.  We pride ourselves in helping positive people who want a brighter future and will not give up.  Amped also donates large amounts of clothing and accessories to Goodwill and other apparel organizations to put clothing on the backs of people who are less fortunate.
At this very moment, we have teamed up with International model Ashley Alexiss to release a t-shirt to support October's breast cancer awareness month.  In addition, $1 per every $10 funded during this campaign will be donated to the Susan G. Komen For The Cure Foundation.







1) When can I expect to see my perk packages?
We will ship out all perk packages in December, just in time to rock your Amped Optics for early spring AND before the general public!
2) What styles and colors wil I be able to chose from when I pledged?
Our newest, most anticipated eyewear yet.  The all-new Emils Series has 3 colors ways to chose from(pictured above).  Once the funding campaign ends we'll be in contact with you to follow up on our progress of design and development and give you the inside sneak peak of what we're working on so you can choose the styles and colors you'd like.
3) What if i'm not the Emils style?
We really want to spread the awareness of our all-new Emils Series to world however if they are not your style, please do not let that hold you back from pledging.  Your pledge also allows you to choose from our classic ever so popular Crossover Wayfarer as well.
4) Do you ship Internationally?
Yes, we do however there may be an addition shipping fee that you will have to cover.  Sorry, we try to be as cool as possible, but give us a break




We would like to thank every backer for any contribution and any assistance in the realization of our project.  Share our concept of Amped Optics amoungst friends and relatives young and old.  Together we will bring the new age of colorful, affordable and sleek Optics to life!

<h3>About Wrap Up Africa</h3>
<p>Wrap Up Africa is utilizing a market-based approach to provide sustainable employment and address the development challenges associated with cancer in Africa. </p>
<p>Wrap Up Africa (WUA) is creating and managing initiatives that help tackle the unacceptable healthcare inequities of cancer care in Africa with an entrepreneurial twist.  In addition to striving to improve access to cancer care in the communities where we work, we are creating employment and opportunities for our tailors, their families, and craftspeople. </p>
<p>Our goals are two fold:</p>
<p>First, develop a beautiful, high quality global fashion line that will generate the required revenue to ensure sustainability of the organization and provide empowerment and employment opportunities to our tailors and their families.</p>
<p>Second, improve knowledge about cancer and assist cancer patients with the access to the best possible treatment and supportive care in order to control pain, improve quality of life, and extend survival.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Products</strong></h3>
<p>WUA’s artisanal products are hand-made by our trained tailors and locally skilled tradesmen and women. Grounded in African design, modified for Western markets, we craft each individual garment to best utilizes the rich tapestry of African fabrics and natural resources. Our textiles and findings are sourced through local markets, often with added elements from neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia. To further enhance their beauty, we commission local artisans to create decorative design finishes out of clay, bone, metal and wood. Each day, our team overcomes extraordinary challenges to create a single piece of original beauty, continually exceeding the expectation of clients, company, and self.</p>
<h3>Our Journey</h3>
<p>Wrap Up Africa has been hard at work training tailors since 2007. At the beginning, all of our tailors were new to sewing, and so all of our products had to be simple to construct. Over time, their skills have grown with continued practice and training. A few years ago we realized that we had a pool of well-trained tailors who were capable of making beautiful, high-quality clothes. We decided that it was time to create a new line of products and Tailor’s Uganda (TUTU) was born.</p>
<p>Our vision for the TUTU line is to create a beautiful collection of clothes that stands on its own merit in terms of design, construction, and beauty with a unique point of view and brand identity. We want to push the boundaries of what people expect to see from products made in Africa and showcase the creativity and beauty that can be found there. By working with local artists and crafts people in addition to the most skilled of our tailors we are creating something very special.</p>
<p>Our clothes have been on a journey of becoming. They have taken time to evolve along with the skills of our team. We love to think about people buying them and how our customers' stories, at least in part, align with ours. Wrap Up Africa’s TUTU becomes a part of our customers' journey and they carry a piece of us along with them.</p>
<h3>Your Contribution</h3>
<p>Your tax-deductible contribution will enable us to cover production costs for our fashion line, which provides jobs to cancer patients and their families, provide specialized training to our Uganda staff members, upgrade our equipment, market the collections to retailers, and take it to trade shows in order generate sales. Our unique clothes are made by tailors working to meet the extraordinary challenges that accompany a cancer diagnosis in Uganda.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>All of our tailors are family members of cancer patients working to meet the cost of care and support for their patient. When you wear our clothes you can feel as good as you look. Wrap Up Africa is working to increase trade with Africa by producing 100% of our fashion collection in Uganda. A 1% increase in trade to Africa is equal to three times the amount of money Africa receives in aid annually.</p>
<p>We are also building long-term, sustainable opportunities for our tailors, local artisans, and manufacturers. We are working to help build better infrastructure that will not only support us but also other local businesses and to encourage new investment and community-building initiatives in Uganda.</p>
<p><b><i>We believe that when people and business work together to tackle big challenges, anything is possible.</i></b></p>
<p>We believe that applying an economic solution to a development challenge will help bring about a lasting change in Africa that aid alone could never accomplish. Furthermore, the market has demonstrated that “doing good” is good for business. Increasingly, customers are seeking products with a social impact, so where and how a product is made has never mattered more. Retailers and manufactures are beginning to recognize the shift in customer attitudes and the value of working with companies like WUA. WUA provides a way for companies and their customers to engage with social change while having a positive impact on their bottom lines.</p>

are building the definitive Online Social Platform for the Sports Enthusiast.<br/><br/><p>We
live in a world rife with hardship, conflict, uncertainty, and change. This is
nothing new, of course. Change always has been and always will be one of the
constant forces that humanity faces. Yet, no matter what kind of change shakes
our little blue orb, there is another constant that stabilizes us and provides
us with comfort and camaraderie. For as long as human beings have sought to
make positive sense of the world around them, there have been Sports. Our
sports, our games, our teams, and our players are a conduit into which we pour
all our joys, worries, aspirations, and dreams. Sports are always there for us.</p>
<p>In
the age of social media it is so much easier to connect with the world around
us. However, as we develop more “connections” with friends on Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram and myriad other social platforms, the significance of those
connections start to wane. With an increase in the quantity of our social ties,
we witness a simultaneous dilution in the quality of those relationships. We
believe what is missing is context. In erasing the boundaries space and
distance play in relationship building, those relationships have become less
grounded. As a result, our world is becoming more fragmented than we care to
admit. At Sportscircle, we want to utilize the wondrous possibilities of social
networking by tethering it to a central theme. A theme that is universal,
ancient, and, perhaps most vitally, human. Sports.</p>
<p>We
invest so much of ourselves into our teams, for reasons as numerous and mysterious
as the human soul itself. Whether we're rooting for the hometown club, a
particular athlete, or a nation representing our cultural heritage on the
world's stage, sports informs us emotionally. For so many of us, following
sports can take on a feeling of spiritual significance, of joyful obsession. We
pour over statistics in almanacs and articles, scream urgently at our
televisions when our teams fall that inch short. And we make friends, some
through our enthusiasm for the same team and some for the giddy thrill that
only a great rivalry can provide. And yes, you do have to mow your friend's
lawn next weekend. The sports bet is sacred!</p>
<p>With
the Olympics, we are transported back to the origins of sport. We are enlivened
by a deep feeling of national and global camaraderie, a sense of pride in the
athletes that represent us, as well as in ourselves. We empathize. We
celebrate. We connect. Once every two years, the world chooses to give itself
over to an ancient bond that bridges divides of both physical distance and
history. Sportscircle wants to take that feeling and place it in the arena of
social media. Our mission is to show the world that the great things we see in
ourselves and admire in others during times of great athletic competition, is
always present. The digital age has already provided us with a wealth of spaces
for social activity. Sportscircle wishes to go a step further by using sports,
the world's greatest social glue, as a jumping off point for forging new
connections and strengthening those we already have.</p>
<p>Sports unite complete strangers. It is a bond that spans cultures and
generations. Put a large group of people who don't know each other into a room,
and sports are sure to come up in conversation.  Imagine, you are at a
symphony performance. As the violins and cellos play, it’s beautiful and in
sync and you’re enjoying yourself. However, when the climax hits, everyone is
silent, waiting for the next chord to drop, and in that moment you are all of
one mind, one body, one soul. This is what the bond sports enthusiasts feel
when they watch a football game together at a crowded bar as a last second
“Hail Mary” is launched into the air. When the receiver catches or drops the
ball, the entire bar erupts and collective celebration (or agony) ensues. But,
in either case, a group of disparate people has been moved to see and feel
something as one.</p>
<p>Sports inspire us. In spite of whatever corruption and scandal
may dominate today's headlines, sports so often reminds us of what continues to
be good in our world. They remind us of the values that make not only good
athletes, but good human beings: hard work, integrity, and fair play. Sports
are filled with people who strive for excellence. Watching these people,
whether as fellow athletes or as a devoted spectators, makes us lift our sights
a little higher and encourages us to set new milestones for our everyday lives.
Sports make us part of something bigger than ourselves.</p>
<p>Sports allow belief in the impossible. Do we believe in
miracles? That ""anything-can-happen mentality"" is like nothing else
in the world. Like life itself, we think we have it all figured out, when
suddenly the impossible happens. The #1 team loses, the unbeatable record is
broken. The realization that anything can happen kicks magic into the air and
stirs the little kid in all of us to once again ask, ""Why not?"" </p>
<p>Sports engage our competitive nature. It provides an outlet to
the primal desire to become better than who we are. It takes those heroes
we revere and shines the mirror of greatness back at us. In sports, justice
translates as fairness. In sports, we expect that the ""rules of the
game"" will be strictly enforced. We demand fairness, and we insist that
every athlete be judged on his or her merits as an athlete regardless of race,
creed, color, country of origin or anything extraneous to talent. The rules
that govern sports are held sacrosanct and we come to understand how errors
have consequences. And, at the end of the day, the final call stands and we
move on a little wiser than we were. </p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p>Sportscircle is for all of us...any of the billions of people worldwide who are sports
enthusiasts. The casual fan that simply want to meet other fans, the recent
college graduate looking for a place to watch the game in a new city, the
mother seeking recommendations for sports for her kids to play, the athlete
looking for other athletes to train and share tips with, the trainer looking
for people to train, the competitor looking for training or nutrition tips, the
rabid sports nut looking for others to chat with, the fan looking to buy or
sell tickets, the ex athlete looking to put together a neighborhood pick-up
game, the student-athlete looking to attend college, the Fantasy sports junkie.

every athlete be judged on his or her merits as an athlete regardless of race,
creed, color, country of origin or anything extraneous to talent. The rules
that govern sports are held sacrosanct and we come to understand how errors
have consequences. And, at the end of the day, the final call stands and we
move on a little wiser than we were. 

Sportscircle is for all of us...any of the billions of people worldwide who are sports
enthusiasts. The casual fan that simply want to meet other fans, the recent
college graduate looking for a place to watch the game in a new city, the
mother seeking recommendations for sports for her kids to play, the athlete
looking for other athletes to train and share tips with, the trainer looking
for people to train, the competitor looking for training or nutrition tips, the
rabid sports nut looking for others to chat with, the fan looking to buy or
sell tickets, the ex athlete looking to put together a neighborhood pick-up
game, the student-athlete looking to attend college, the Fantasy sports junkie.
Come share your passions, your experiences, your successes and your setbacks.
Share your insights on training and competition.

<b>The problem of traditional shoe manufacturing</b>: It all started from one of my very first trips to a shoe factory.   Traditional shoe manufacturing requires plenty of production lines and hundreds of laborers for the whole process.

<h3>What if Football Manager was real? Or realer..</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Managing your own real football club and watching it grow and climb the national leagues, surely thats what dreams are made of?</p>
<p>We're raising funds to develop a football club run by you, the supporters. All club decisions will be voted on by its supporters through a dedicated website and mobile app. This is yours, you can help vote on all aspects of the club from the name and branding to the team formations on match day.</p>
<p>This first stage funding aims to develop the core website and mobile app, register the club for a 2015/2016 county FA league season and acquire a team of players. All remaining funding will be placed within the clubs funding pool to be used based on the decision of its supporters. </p>
<p>Through the dedication  and expertise of our supporters, we hope to grow the club and climb to the national leagues over the coming years. This will be a club you can truly support.</p>
<p><b>Club profit is given back to supporters in the form of prizes based on a points system, supporters who regularly nominate winning decisions and vote on successful match day choices will be rewarded with monetary prizes!</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>About the football, not the money</h4>
<p>Crowdfund FC (working title) is a non-profit football club and focuses solely on the football. While money is required to support and run a football club, all club actions are entirely based on improving the football expertise of the club. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>So who's the club manager?</h4>
<p>You, along with all other supporters. We are currently developing a dedicated website in which all supporters can vote on the actions of the club, from which players we purchase/sell to which formations and tactics are deployed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1004540/files/20141111052857-crowdfund-laptop.png?1415712537"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h4>Who are the players?</h4>
<p>You decide! Players are nominated by the supporters and then voted on, depending on funds available to the club further contributions may be asked for from supporters should the club funds not be sufficient.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>How will it work?</h4>
<p>The club will have a supported elected committee whose role is to ensure the club maintains its democratic state. The supporters will take on the role of the club manager by voting through a dedicated website and/or app on any part of the club. Supporters can also nominate potential directions for the club, for example on match day supporters can nominate a particular formation and allow other supporters to vote on the formation they feel will win the match.</p>
<p>All players, coaches, club name/badge, venue, ticket cost, etc.. is decided entirely by the supporters.</p>
<p>The club will begin within a county FA league (of which will be voted on) and aim to climb the leagues in the coming years.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>If I pledge more money, do I get to vote more?</h4>
<p>As we believe money shouldn't be the driving force in football we have decided that all supporters should have equal voting rights no matter how much they pledge. Instead we have decided to give all early-supporters who join within the first fund raising stage (yes you!) to gain 1 extra vote (2 votes in total) instead. People who wish to pledge more will earn other rewards such as season passes and merchandise.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Where will the money go?</h4>
<p>There are certain costs involved with registering a team with the FA and entering a county based league, along with developing football kits and renting a club venue.</p>
<p>We will also be developing a dedicated website and app to allow all supporters to vote, the website is currently in early development stages and the funding will help us grow these services. Until our website is live voting can be taken place on our Facebook page which will go live shortly.</p>
<p>All remaining funding will be held by the club within its funding pool to finance club decisions such as player wages. All use of any club funding is decided upon by its supporters. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our funding target then any proceeds we do receive shall still be used towards the development of the website and mobile app, our primary sponsor Jackpot7 will support us should the club lack the necessary funds. Should the club require further funds to pay players or hire venues, extra rounds of fund raising shall take place.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Who are Jackpot7?</h4>Jackpot7 are our primary sponsors who are here to support the club with all administrative duties along with boosting our profile to encourage more supporters to join. Jackpot7 will never vote or control the clubs decisions and act as a non-voting third party simply to support the clubs growth.<p></p>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>There are always risks and challenges involved with sport, primarily the lack of funding to further progress the club and challenge the well established clubs currently in the national leagues. However we believe that with the uniqueness of Crowdfund FC, the club can draw in supporters who are devoted to the success of the club. Along with the backing of our primary sponsor Jackpot7 we believe the club will be able to progress successfully.</div><div>
<ul>
<br/> </ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We need as many football fans to get involved as possible! Know anyone who is tired of watching business nonsense and money ruining their beloved club? Or anyone who can't pull themselves away from Football Manager? Send them here! The more supporters we have the faster we can roll out and grow our club!</div></div>","What if Football Manager was real? Or realer..

All remaining funding will be held by the club within its funding pool to finance club decisions such as player wages. All use of any club funding is decided upon by its supporters. 
If we don't reach our funding target then any proceeds we do receive shall still be used towards the development of the website and mobile app, our primary sponsor Jackpot7 will support us should the club lack the necessary funds. Should the club require further funds to pay players or hire venues, extra rounds of fund raising shall take place.


Who are Jackpot7?Jackpot7 are our primary sponsors who are here to support the club with all administrative duties along with boosting our profile to encourage more supporters to join. Jackpot7 will never vote or control the clubs decisions and act as a non-voting third party simply to support the clubs growth.

Risks & ChallengesThere are always risks and challenges involved with sport, primarily the lack of funding to further progress the club and challenge the well established clubs currently in the national leagues. However we believe that with the uniqueness of Crowdfund FC, the club can draw in supporters who are devoted to the success of the club. Along with the backing of our primary sponsor Jackpot7 we believe the club will be able to progress successfully.

    
Other Ways You Can HelpWe need as many football fans to get involved as possible! Know anyone who is tired of watching business nonsense and money ruining their beloved club? Or anyone who can't pull themselves away from Football Manager? Send them here! The more supporters we have the faster we can roll out and grow our club!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We started Men of Habit in March of 2011 with the hopes of serving the intelligent menswear community with thoughtful stories, interviews, and advice that guys can't get from the sea of commercial fashion magazines that are currently available. Five months into our journey and our site has grown into one of the premiere destinations for stylish men--it is the place where they can learn about young brands, get exclusive looks at quality product well before it hits shelves, and read conversations with the most knowledgeable men on clothing and style in the world. While we have enjoyed our place on the internet and will continue to improve our content and design, we've always had a dream to create the world's best print magazine for style obsessed men. We have assembled a large team of writers and photographers to make this vision become a reality and are couldn't be happier about the long term potential of this magazine with guys like G. Bruce Boyer, F.E. Castleberry, and Derek Guy all helping with our operation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Currently, there is next to nothing for an English speaking man who wants to raise his knowledge about style above the low-level information he can pick up in GQ and Esquire. While the Japanese have magazines like Men's Ex, Leon, Free &amp; Easy, and The Suit Catalog, those in America and the UK are without a print source to educate them on style and the clothing industry. With articles on Savile Row tailors, conversations with some of the best known Italian craftsmen, and personal style portraits of the the menswear industry's best, we've positioned our magazine to fill the void that is missing in the market.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently, we have grouped together a team of the best style writers and photographers in the industry and are working with a major New York based publisher to get the magazine launched for Spring/Summer 2012. What we're lacking is the funds to complete the layout and design of the magazine--which is incredibly important to the success of any magazine. With design complete we will be able put the stories we have planned into production and have our magazine hitting the press in a timely fashion.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The goal of $8,000 is an attainable one and every bit of money donated will be going towards the intended cause. We are confident our goal can be reached, but continuing your support past the $8,000 mark brings benefits that will further increase the quality of the magazine. Any excess of our goal will go directly into funding our content so that we can raise the production value of our photography and pay our writers appropriately. </p>

The focus of this campaign is our signature piece, the abbewrap.  Toss one on over whatever you're wearing and feel instantly Confident and Sophisticated!

A single item that can be worn in over 15 different ways...and counting... 
View all 15 different ways in our Gallery!What should I wear today?  One of life's biggest and most frustrating questions.  Save time and energy, reduce stress and decision-making.Set a great example for your children and be an Inspiration to others...ditch the hoodies and 'frazzled' look.  Throw on a wrap and show them that everyone CAN look and feel great with minimal effort, even amidst the chaos of daily life :) Reduce.Reuse.Recycle - everything has a ""re-purpose"" and our hang tag KARMA bracelets are no exception! We've taken the ordinary and made it extraordinary...Wear and share the abbecoté KARMA bracelet as a discreet confidence builder always within reach.
While we can’t grant world peace (just yet)…we can dress you with peace of mind.  For each abbewrap purchased, we will donate one, in your honor, to a charitable organization that helps women better their lives.   This is truly paying it forward!This campaign supports the Susan G. Komen Foundation and Olive Crest - Strong Families, Safe Kids.Know of an organization that could use our help?  Contact Us to nominate them!
The modern pace of life begs for a fresh approach to how women dress.  abbecoté is redesigning fashion for redefined lifestyles.

Clothing that is easy to wear and flexible, adapting to your many activities, moods, and changes throughout your evolving life.   Our abbewrap doesn't require much from you, but gives a whole lot back!  
Wherever you go, whatever your mood; abbewraps have got you covered.
Your support will allow us to begin production of the abbewrap and expand our brand.  The more you contribute and share, the more items we will add to the abbecoté line; from branded accessories to our ""go2pieces"" collection of Sophisticated and Effortless clothing that speaks to our philosophy.  And remember, each purchase = donations to help improve the lives of others.  So what do YOU do?

1. Pre-order your Fall abbewraps by selecting a perk.  Our Fall wraps are a knit blend with a hint of Angora - to keep you warm without the bulk and create a soft, heathered look.

2. Pick your favorite color, or don't, and get one of each! Remember 1=1

3. All perks will be shipped at the conclusion of the campaign.
 

Wait!  There's more...  Share this campaign with your friends and stay in touch with abbecoté on social media.  Participate in our upcoming photo contests - there WILL be prizes!

Our Story 
Hi, we are Veronica and Jessica, the founders of nvenn hair and beauty. 
We started nvenn because we wanted to spark change in the world while doing something we love. We are award winning hairstylists and have been a part of the industry for a combined 20 years and it has now become a part of who we are. 


Along the way, we started to see a trend happening with the industry. The love of hair was getting lost. Products are no longer about quality ingredients and high performance; companies stopped caring about our environment and our world. It all became a bottom dollar / profit game. 
We thought what if we could make a difference? What if we could spark a movement? We created the brand to stand for something. It is about so much more than just hair... quality, empowerment & community - to name a few.
We've spent the last few years developing the line: sourcing materials, quality testing, developing our brand and engineering our starting line-up. We have released our prototypes in to the market, and we've gotten amazing feedback from our early users.
We're eager to bring our hair line out to the world, but we need your help to meet our high production costs. Preorder your products to help fund our first production run.
The difference start with us. Join the movement. Lots of Love!

<em>THE DESIGNER</em><br/><br/>Autumn Teneyl is a fashion designer and artist best known for her unique feminine, freeâ€flowing designs.

<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong>Introducing: Le Boustique</strong></h3>
<p>I have had an artistic drive from the very beginning. I grew up on tour following The Grateful Dead, traveling in my families re-vamped buses. This has evolved my style into an eclectic mixture of Dead Head chic, Beverly Hills couture, indigo child, with a touch of country girl. Integrating all of my experience and passions thus far, I am going to bring to the world a vessel showcasing a collection of work from various designers, artists and of course, myself.<br/><br/>This vessel aspires to fuse together music, art, fashion &amp; alternative energy. What drives this dream is a 1961 Ford bus! This mobile store will be able to travel to any event, festival, &amp; social gathering within driving distance. It's going to be an outlet to show people how they can live the dream! My goal is to live a life of freedom, happiness, and spread conscious community to all of those who come into contact with my vision.<br/><br/>My dream of opening and running this vessel begins with you. I need your help to get this project started! Without you, this project isn't possible. You will help bring this dream into physical form. Together we can make a difference!</p>
<p>This project is part of a much bigger picture! The Becky Saves the World Tour 2012 is happening now! We are going to have a caravan of vehicles heading out across America to educate the masses on environmental topics. Le Boustique is vessel #1 to be up and running! We strive to be larger than the Grateful Dead movement. This movement is even more powerful because it will be benefitting Mother Earth!<br/><br/></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong>What I Need</strong></h3>

<p><br/>This ol’ lady needs a paint job, interior &amp; exterior along with a new floor. She also needs to be revamped so that she can fit the boutique standards with shelves, racks, mirrors &amp; a sound system. Materials will cost a dime because they will come from found objects. Fresh paint and a sturdy floor however have a price and so does the new clutch that is required to make her drive-able. All inventory collected will have certain requirements of being made from recycled materials, found/reused objects, or companies that support environmental concerns. Most of those items are already in the material possession of Mieka and you may have even seen them at various events and places where she has exhibited them. The ultimate goal &amp; final touch is to have solar panels power the sound system, lighting, and appliances.</p>

<p>Every dollar counts towards this cause. It won’t take very much to really get this project going! Please, donate whatever it is that you can afford. If money is an issue for you there are other ways that you can help. You can spread this campaign to those you think would be interested. You can also donate your time and help with any other the above needed pieces to the project. If you are a painter, you can help with the paint job. If you know how to install solar energy, help with that. Whatever your forte is, feel free to jump on board the build team! The easiest way, is to financially contribute and spread the word using the share tools on the indie-go-go page! Thank you for taking time to check out this project!

I have had an artistic drive from the very beginning. I grew up on tour following The Grateful Dead, traveling in my families re-vamped buses. This has evolved my style into an eclectic mixture of Dead Head chic, Beverly Hills couture, indigo child, with a touch of country girl. Integrating all of my experience and passions thus far, I am going to bring to the world a vessel showcasing a collection of work from various designers, artists and of course, myself.This vessel aspires to fuse together music, art, fashion & alternative energy. What drives this dream is a 1961 Ford bus! This mobile store will be able to travel to any event, festival, & social gathering within driving distance. It's going to be an outlet to show people how they can live the dream! My goal is to live a life of freedom, happiness, and spread conscious community to all of those who come into contact with my vision.My dream of opening and running this vessel begins with you. I need your help to get this project started! Without you, this project isn't possible. You will help bring this dream into physical form. Together we can make a difference!
This project is part of a much bigger picture! The Becky Saves the World Tour 2012 is happening now! We are going to have a caravan of vehicles heading out across America to educate the masses on environmental topics. Le Boustique is vessel #1 to be up and running! We strive to be larger than the Grateful Dead movement. This movement is even more powerful because it will be benefitting Mother Earth!
What I Need

This ol’ lady needs a paint job, interior & exterior along with a new floor. She also needs to be revamped so that she can fit the boutique standards with shelves, racks, mirrors & a sound system. Materials will cost a dime because they will come from found objects. Fresh paint and a sturdy floor however have a price and so does the new clutch that is required to make her drive-able. All inventory collected will have certain requirements of being made from recycled materials, found/reused objects, or companies that support environmental concerns. Most of those items are already in the material possession of Mieka and you may have even seen them at various events and places where she has exhibited them. The ultimate goal & final touch is to have solar panels power the sound system, lighting, and appliances.

<div><h3> Why The Expensive Gear?</h3></div>
<div>I need this specific gear to harness the full potential of my designing and creativity.

<div>Also, as an added bonus. The highest paying contributor will receive a once in a life time gift pack. ON TOP of the perk they purchase (We are basically saying we will shower you in gifts because you are so incredibly awesome)</div>
<div>This gift could be any of the following:</div>

From this encounter was born a strong friendship. Among other common interests, sustainability was something that brought us to more serious conversations. ""Why is there so much pollution everywhere, threatening the places we love? Can we do something about it ?""  </p><p><b>Low quality goods and planned obsolescence</b> have created more products than we ever needed. Over the past ten years, we've produced more plastic than during all of the last century. With more than 22 000 tons of plastic waste entering our oceans every day, this issue isn't going away any time soon. There must be a better way to produce and consume goods! We decided to take a stance at it and tackle the problem. This is why we put sustainability and ethics at the core of everything we do. Being both watch enthusiasts was the opportunity to start with a product we love, but <b>also an object that could become a sign of recognition for a community of people sharing the same sustainable values.</b></p><div data-id=""21834895""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1533160841/s7hbbspnsstbg9g12tvu.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""22066544""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p> </p>

Light is a free, natural and unlimited energy. Our movement absorbs this energy from everywhere, outside or inside, and brings life to our watches, just as the sun does for humans. It’s easy going. Three hours wear on your wrist will provide up to six months of power reserve, without any light. In simple words: it’s perpetual energy on your wrist.It’s sustainable. No disposable battery, so minimal impact. It’s service-free, which means no extra cost.Our solar movement is made in Japan by company owned by Seiko. Which means a perfect accuracy, and à 99,5% reliability rate. What else could we expect? Our watch definitely focuses on accentuating emotional expression and natural impression. In the end, we’ve made a watch that highlights the successful combination of design and sustainability. And above all, made to last.   Water Resistance to 100M  This means you can live with your watch on. You’ll never have to ask yourself if you should take it off not. Totally life-proof. K1 Dome glass  The K1 is a premium material which offers increased durability and scratch resistance compared to standard mineral or plastic glass. It is also easier to recycle than saphir crystal. We applied an anti-reflective coating to the inner side of the crystal to minimize glare. SuperLuminova ®  Hands and hour markers has been coated withC1 SuperLuminova ®, a luminescent paint which increases the visibility when the light comes down while giving a beautiful look in the dark.

 For us, just as for most people, the experience of a product starts with the box: we wanted it to transmit our values at first glance. 100% recycled and recyclable FSC paper, even though you won't want to throw it away. It's 15% lighter than a standard box, with the same volume, and this allows us to optimize our carbon impact.  
We like people who are deeply involved in making our planet a cleaner world. This is how we met the Trash Hero guys, who are doing a fantastic job across the world to create sustainable, community-based projects that remove existing waste, and reduce future waste by inspiring long-term behavior change. Their action is just amazing, as they’ve already removed 408 tons of trash with the help of 63 000 volunteers.   As we share the same values, we wanted to give them our support to develop their organization and increase their impact. It will result 160 beach clean-up that will allow to remove more than 17 tons of trash from oceans.Trash heroes from Trash Hero 
Hi Guys, this is Lilian and Fred, Awake founders. We started this journey 2 years ago after we met while we were travelling in Asia. From this encounter was born a strong friendship. Among other common interests, sustainability was something that brought us to more serious conversations. ""Why is there so much pollution everywhere, threatening the places we love? Can we do something about it ?""  Low quality goods and planned obsolescence have created more products than we ever needed. Over the past ten years, we've produced more plastic than during all of the last century. With more than 22 000 tons of plastic waste entering our oceans every day, this issue isn't going away any time soon. There must be a better way to produce and consume goods! We decided to take a stance at it and tackle the problem. This is why we put sustainability and ethics at the core of everything we do. Being both watch enthusiasts was the opportunity to start with a product we love, but also an object that could become a sign of recognition for a community of people sharing the same sustainable values.",52.0,0,"1 Campaign

 The Stealth Pant’s high-tech performance fabric is lightweight and smooth. These slacks will never leave you feeling weighed down or irritated by heavy, itchy fabrics. The secret is our special blend of nylon, rayon, and lycra, which is breathable and flexible, unlike stuffy and stiff wool or polyester. It also gives the Stealth Pant great moisture wicking capabilities. If you live in an area with hot and humid summers you won’t have to worry about your pants being damp all day, because they dry out in no time. Unlike the materials used to make most office slacks, the Stealth Pant’s machine washable fabric blend was chosen for easy, at-home care. No more expensive, time-consuming trips to the dry cleaners are necessary. If they get dirty, just throw them in the washing machine, dry them on a line or in a dryer, and they’re ready to be worn again.Because of the Stealth Pant’s wrinkle resistant properties, you won’t have to worry about doing any ironing--your pants will be completely free of wrinkles after a wash and dry. Even if you stuff them into a gym bag, any wrinkles will fade after a few minutes of wear.Yeah, us too. But you gotta look nice at the office, right? That's why we created the Stealth Pant, made from our own customized yoga pant material that will make you feel like you're wearing sweatpants, while looking as professional as the CEO. Trust us, no one will know how comfortable you are.We got tired of things falling out of our pockets, so we designed the Stealth Pant with bigger ones.

<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WHAT’S THE DEAL <span><br/></span></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WITH SULFITES?</span>
</h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sulfur dioxide (SO2), commonly know as Sulfites, is a chemical compound added to wine, to preserve it for shipment and to prolong the shelf life for retail. </p>
<p>Sulfites do nothing to enhance the products taste or appearance, but is necessary in order for winemakers to ship and commercialize their products for consumers. Sulfites are added to prevent oxidation and keep the wine from going bad.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1347470/files/20150401155555-wine_one_shelf.jpg?1427928955"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4><b>Seems ok right? Well, not exactly.</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Sulfites are currently regarded as one of the top food allergens affecting the general population today.  </p>
<p>In 1986, after the identification of numerous sulfite related instances, the FDA prohibited the use of sulfites on fruits and vegetables intended to be served raw or presented as fresh. This sulfite regulation carried over to alcoholic beverages where the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. Department of Treasury, currently demands that the presence of sulfites in wine be declared in plain view on the product label. </p>
<p>Sulfites are one of the only ingredients within alcoholic beverages that must be declared clearly on the label.</p>
<p>Why is that? As we all know, just because we are “allowed” to consume something doesn't mean that you should. For many people, consuming sulfites can cause serious issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sulfite sensitivity affects millions of people today, many of whom are unaware of their own sensitivity to this preservative. Sulfite sensitivity reactions can vary from mild to life threatening in some cases.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Reactions can include some of the following:</b></span></h4>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span>
</div><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Headaches</span><br/>

<p></p>
<p>If you have experienced any of these negative reactions during or after drinking wine, you may be one of the millions who suffer from sulfite sensitivity or allergy.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">BUT I DON’T HAVE A <span><br/></span>SULFITE SENSITIVITY, WHY SHOULD I CARE?</span></h1>
<div>
<p>While you may not be sensitive to sulfites or experienced any of the symptoms of sulfite sensitivity, you are still consuming an added preservative each time you drink wine. As mentioned, preservatives are added to foods and beverages to fight against the growth of microorganisms that cause them to go bad, they do not carry any additional health or flavor benefits. </p>
<p>The consumption of these added preservatives has always just been “part of the deal” when eating and drinking most packaged retail products but this is because you have never been able to remove these added preservatives prior to consumption…until now.  StiQit gives you freedom of choice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1328900/files/20150326113557-EXERCISE.jpg?1427394957"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You take care of yourself. You exercise. You maintain a healthy diet of natural and organic foods and avoid processed products. You read labels and are aware of what you are putting in your body. If this sounds like you then why would you just accept and consume added preservatives in your wine?  Especially when now, you don't have to.</p>
<p>We all have heard the health benefits of drinking wine, StiQit just makes it healthier. You gotta love that.</p>
</div>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WE ARE HERE TO HELP YOU</span></h1>
</div><p></p><p>Currently, the only way an individual can prevent a sulfite reaction from occurring is to avoid consuming items that contain sulfites, severely restricting the available choices of beverages that can be enjoyed.</p>
<p></p><h4>For these sulfite sensitive individuals...this means no wine…ever!</h4>
<p>In addition to those who are sensitive to sulfites, there is a growing population of individuals that choose to enjoy sulfite and preservative free lifestyles. If you don't have to consume preservatives with your beverages, why would you? </p>
<h4>Whether you choose to avoid sulfites in search of a healthier lifestyle, or you avoid sulfites to manage your sulfite sensitivity…millions are forced to pass on wine. </h4>
<p>Living without wine is not really living at all, so we created StiQit and restored the freedom of choice for all individuals to enjoy any wine they choose, sulfite free.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">TESTIMONIAL</span></h1><div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fzle3W59Hvhw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dzle3W59Hvhw&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fzle3W59Hvhw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/></span></div><div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></div><p></p><h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WATCH IT WORK</span></h1><div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Do you need proof that StiQit actually works?

<h1>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">How
does StiQit work?</span>
</h1>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">StiQit works by introducing a scientifically
proven and precise quantity of our proprietary developed ingredients into the
wine, that neutralize the sulfites in any <span><br/></span>8 oz. or less glass of wine.</span></p>
<p><b>Can
I reuse my StiQit device?</b><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;"">The StiQit can only be used once to treat a
single 8 oz. or less glass serving of wine. It cannot be used to treat a second
glass of wine.</span></p>
<p><b>Will my StiQit work on a full bottle of wine?</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;"">StiQit will not remove the sulfites from a full
bottle of wine. StiQit is currently designed to remove all sulfites from any
single 8 oz. or less glass of wine. A single StiQit can only be used once with a
single glass of wine.</span></p>
<p><b>Will
StiQit prevent “hangovers”?</b><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;"">StiQit will not prevent hangovers. StiQit will
remove all of the sulfites from a single glass of wine and thereby allow those
that suffer from sulfite sensitivity to once again drink their favorite wine
without potentially suffering the negative consequences associated with their
sulfite sensitivity.</span></p>
<p><b>What
are some reactions to sulfites?</b><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Some of the most common reaction to sulfites
include nasal congestion, flushing, breathing difficulties, skin rashes, hives,
itchiness, upset stomach, diarrhea, vomiting, trouble swallowing, low blood
pressure, headaches.</span></p>
<p><b>Can’t
I just buy “Organic” wine?</b><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;"">All wine contains sulfites. They occur
naturally as a by-product of the fermentation process and are additionally
artificially added at various stages of the wine production process as a
preservative. Organic wine does not mean there are no sulfites present. It
could mean that the grapes have simply been grown organically without the use
of fertilizers or pesticides. Many organic wines still have sulfites added as a
preservative. Organic could also mean that no additional sulfites have been
added during the production process. In this case there are still sulfites
present in the wine as a result of the fermentation process.</span></p>
<p><b>I
found a wine that says “No Sulfites Added”, what does that mean?</b><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;"">It simply means that no artificially added
sulfites were used during the wine production process. It does not, however,
mean that the wine does not contain naturally produced sulfites. All wines have
some level of sulfites due to those that are formed during the fermentation
process.</span></p>
<p><b>Which
has more sulfites? Red wine or white wine?</b><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Both red and white wine contains sulfites. It

red wine.</span></p>
<p><b>How

depending on how much are artificially added by each individual winery. According
to the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) the maximum allowed amount of
sulfites in wine is 350 ppm.</span></p>
<p><b>How
are sulfites measured?</b><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Measuring sulfites in wine is not simple. We
purchased and validated a sulfite meter to measure the sulfites in wine in our
company laboratory. The method requires the use of laboratory equipment to be
able to accurately and reproducibly measure the sulfites in the wine. The
presence of sulfites can also be assessed with the use of sulfite test strips,
such as the ones we used in our video that demonstrated how the StiQit works.
Because these test strips indicate the presence of sulfites by a change in
color, they can only ideally be used for white wine rather than red wine.</span></p>
<p><b>What
does “PPM” mean?</b><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;"">PPM is an abbreviation that means ‘Parts Per

WHAT WE NEEDAND WHAT YOU GET
We are a small and brand new company and  this campaign determines whether we can continue working on StiQit or not. We need at least $50,000 to pay for the cost of everything that's needed to produce StiQit. The donations you give us will be used to fund the molding, casting, production, packaging and shipping of the product. Every penny will be used to pay for making StiQit into a reality.
In return, you’ll be the first to receive StiQit as soon as it comes off the production line. With your generous help, we'll be able to make StiQit available very soon and allow everybody to enjoy their wine sulfite free.

The money raised from this campaign will be used for the following initiatives.




INTRODUCINGStiQit: LIVE SULFITE FREE





StiQit is an easy to use, 100% recyclable, single use device that allows you to remove all sulfites from any wine in just seconds without affecting taste, appearance or aroma.



StiQit IN THE NEWS






WHAT’S THE DEAL WITH SULFITES?



Sulfur dioxide (SO2), commonly know as Sulfites, is a chemical compound added to wine, to preserve it for shipment and to prolong the shelf life for retail. 
Sulfites do nothing to enhance the products taste or appearance, but is necessary in order for winemakers to ship and commercialize their products for consumers. Sulfites are added to prevent oxidation and keep the wine from going bad.





Seems ok right? Well, not exactly.

Sulfites are currently regarded as one of the top food allergens affecting the general population today.  
In 1986, after the identification of numerous sulfite related instances, the FDA prohibited the use of sulfites on fruits and vegetables intended to be served raw or presented as fresh. This sulfite regulation carried over to alcoholic beverages where the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) of the U.S. Department of Treasury, currently demands that the presence of sulfites in wine be declared in plain view on the product label. 
Sulfites are one of the only ingredients within alcoholic beverages that must be declared clearly on the label.
Why is that? As we all know, just because we are “allowed” to consume something doesn't mean that you should. For many people, consuming sulfites can cause serious issues.


Sulfite sensitivity affects millions of people today, many of whom are unaware of their own sensitivity to this preservative. Sulfite sensitivity reactions can vary from mild to life threatening in some cases.

Reactions can include some of the following:



Headaches


Blotchy skin, redness, rash or flushing of the face


Respiratory issues, stuffiness and nasal congestion


Upset stomach, diarrhea and vomiting


Drop in blood pressure and dizziness








If you have experienced any of these negative reactions during or after drinking wine, you may be one of the millions who suffer from sulfite sensitivity or allergy.

BUT I DON’T HAVE A SULFITE SENSITIVITY, WHY SHOULD I CARE?

While you may not be sensitive to sulfites or experienced any of the symptoms of sulfite sensitivity, you are still consuming an added preservative each time you drink wine. As mentioned, preservatives are added to foods and beverages to fight against the growth of microorganisms that cause them to go bad, they do not carry any additional health or flavor benefits. 
The consumption of these added preservatives has always just been “part of the deal” when eating and drinking most packaged retail products but this is because you have never been able to remove these added preservatives prior to consumption…until now.  StiQit gives you freedom of choice.


You take care of yourself. You exercise. You maintain a healthy diet of natural and organic foods and avoid processed products. You read labels and are aware of what you are putting in your body. If this sounds like you then why would you just accept and consume added preservatives in your wine?  Especially when now, you don't have to.
We all have heard the health benefits of drinking wine, StiQit just makes it healthier. You gotta love that.



WE ARE HERE TO HELP YOU
Currently, the only way an individual can prevent a sulfite reaction from occurring is to avoid consuming items that contain sulfites, severely restricting the available choices of beverages that can be enjoyed.
For these sulfite sensitive individuals...this means no wine…ever!
In addition to those who are sensitive to sulfites, there is a growing population of individuals that choose to enjoy sulfite and preservative free lifestyles. If you don't have to consume preservatives with your beverages, why would you? 
Whether you choose to avoid sulfites in search of a healthier lifestyle, or you avoid sulfites to manage your sulfite sensitivity…millions are forced to pass on wine. 
Living without wine is not really living at all, so we created StiQit and restored the freedom of choice for all individuals to enjoy any wine they choose, sulfite free.TESTIMONIALWATCH IT WORKDo you need proof that StiQit actually works? Well, here you go. Ron Hiebsch, Senior Research Scientist and Laboratory Director, demonstrates just how easy it is to remove all sulfites from any wine.HOW IT WORKS
StiQit is an easy to use, single use device that allows you to remove all sulfites from any wine in just seconds without affecting the appearance, aroma and most importantly the taste. The StiQit is 100% recyclable, BPA free and environmentally friendly.  
With StiQit, it’s simple:


A LOOK AT SULFITES IN WINE
As previously mentioned, sulfites added to wine are used as a preservative and can be added during several stages in the winemaking process. 
Sulfites are measured in parts per million “ppm”. Different style of wines contain different allowable amounts. When we say allowable, we mean the FDA regulates the levels of sulfites contained in wine. Can you say “red flag”?



By using StiQit, you now have the ability to remove all sulfites from ANY wine. With StiQit, No more “allowable maximum amounts”, you can finally have sulfite free wine, champagne or cider.


THE PAST YEAR AND HALF

We have spent the past year and half creating the perfect formulation that allows StiQit to remove all sulfites from any wine, champagne or cider. We have spent countless hours in the lab, testing our proprietary ingredients against the majority of options available at retail today. 

We have finalized our proprietary active ingredients.


We have discovered the exact measured amount that must be used in order to achieve a successful single use device. Just a few stirs and you are done.


We have tested and retested our device against numerous classes and variations of wine. All with great success.


We have tested StiQit with sulfite sensitive individuals for real world reaction (or lack there of), again with great success.


We have identified our manufacturer, warehouse and shipper.


We have chosen our final prototypes to ensure maximum ease of use. Including our innovative “Q Clip” to identify your glass of sulfite free wine in a group setting.

Design

  We asked ourselves how we could make a wood wallet that is simple, beautiful and also durable. The biggest challenge was wood itself. Everyone knows wood is lovely but also easily breakable in many situations. After months of prototyping and testing different designs, we've created the perfect wood wallet that everybody loves to carry without worrying about breaking.

CLYH Wallet Demo
 



 
 
Wood

  CLYH Wallet is made of three different types of wood. Bubinga, Purpleheart and Cherry.
· Bubinga :
  We use special figured bubinga called ‘Waterfall’ with its random swirls  and shadings, which make this wood truly unique. Bubinga is an incredibly strong  wood by any measure, exceeding nearly every other wood species.
· Purpleheart : 

  Purpleheart is named after the vibrant color of its wood which, when it is cut, quickly turns from a light brown to a rich purple color. It is also rated as being very durable, and able to resist both water and decay.
 


Leather, Tannery
  CLYH Wallet is made with Vegetable-tanned Leather which is considered the highest grade of leather. Located in Santa Croce sull’Arno(PI), Italy, La Perla Azzurra is one of the greatest Vegetable Tannery In Italy. Its leather is used in a number of products including sporting goods, casual footwear as well as small leather goods.



More information about La Perla Azzurra.
  Saddle Stitch     Leather stitch is very important in product durability. The type of stitch we are using is called Saddle stitch(Hand-Stitch). It’s much stronger than a machine made stitch, costs more, and also time consuming.

  CLYH Wallet is made of Wood. So we spent several months focusing on durability. The direction of wood grain is important when making a product with wood. Let's take one example.  When you split wood with the grain, you can break it easily. But when you break across the grain, it becomes much harder to break. To take full advantage of a wood’s strength, we glued woods together with the cross grain at 90°. 

  We spent lots of time field testing the product and of course, our Wood Wallets still look beautiful and work perfectly.

Il est conçu pour pouvoir respirer sans être étouffé grâce à un flux d'air pur créé par deux petits ventilateurs silencieux.Ce masque léger et respirable est idéal par tout type de temps (Chaud et Froid) grâce à sa ventilation active et sera également une solution parfaite pour les heures de travail au bureau, les conventions, les réunions commerciales, etc.Les matériaux bio-compatibles utilisés dans Mask Off vous permettent d'être à l'aise pendant de nombreuses heures sans restreindre la circulation de l'air. Nous utilisons les informations de l'AFNOR sur les données anthropométriques de l'ISO/TS 16976-2 pour nous assurer que le masque est confortable pour tous les utilisateurs.Filtration & Purification en entrée et sortie du masqueLe ventilateur actif crée un flux à travers un filtre homologué pour être respiré par l'utilisateur, puis un second ventilateur rejette l'air respiré à travers un second filtre. Mask Off en quelques mots    Mask Off, une solution économique comparé aux masques chirurgicaux jetablesComparatif    Cout consommable annuel : représente le cout des filtres pour l'utilisation journalière du masque pendant un an pour un utilisateur.C'est là que Mask Off intervient !   Filtre de Qualité Certifiée à faible Coût  Mask Off utilise des petits filtres à air, très abordables et à haut rendement, certifiés par le ministère français des Armées et la DGA. Chaque pack Mask Off est livré avec 4 mois de filtres, vous disposez de 4 mois d'utilisation quotidienne du masque. Vous pouvez acheter des filtres supplémentaires pour 15€ (transport inclus) pour un nouveau pack de 4 mois de filtres. Notre technologie utilise 100 fois moins de surface de filtres que les masques chirurgicaux et permet de faire d'énormes économies de transport et de déchets.Pour une utilisation quotidienne Fini les Lunettes Embuées Mask Off dispose d'un traitement antibuée : il s'agit du même procédé que celui utilisé dans les casques de motards, qui permet de voir à travers l'équipement pour plus de sécurité. De plus, la double ventilation active permet également d'éviter la buée. Protection en plus avec la version UltravioletsÀ l'intérieur des Pods Ultraviolets, une LED UV-C purifie le filtre.  Les Pods Ultraviolets n'émettent pas de lumière UV-C en dehors du boitier. Ainsi, le masque ne subit pas de fuite d'UV-C pendant le processus de purification du filtre, il n'y a donc aucun risque pour l'utilisateur. Cette fonctionnalité est proposée en option à Mask Off.Nous proposons trois versions différentes, Mask Off Ultraviolet, et Mask Off, sans UV-C. Nous proposons également une version entièrement noire appelée « Mask Off Carbon ». Choisissez la Couleur de Votre LanièreLes lanières du masque sont fournies en trois coloris différents : Noir, Blanc, Gris. Plus de confusion car chaque membre de la famille peut facilement différencier son masque grâce à la lanière facilement interchangeable !  Pods Modulaires pour une autonomie infinieLes pods sont facilement remplaçables et rechargeables par un port micro USB. Le filtre, mais également l'unité de ventilation, peuvent être remplacés. Il est possible de commander des unités de ventilation de rechange pour prolonger l'autonomie afin de vous adapter à votre mode de vie et couvrir une journée complète d'utilisation avec un seul masque. Les pods additionnels sont vendus par paires (ventilateur d'entrée et de sortie), une paire de Pods prolonge l'autonomie du produit de 3 heures. De plus, le masque est très simple à utiliser !

<h3>Elite Series Golf LLC</h3>
<p><strong>Where Art and Golf meet!</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Elite Series Golf- </strong> A company that helps Corporations and Charities create custom logo golf drivers and putters for their golf outings and most important clients, VIP, sales staff, give aways, prizes and top performers.</p>
<p><strong>So where did the idea for Elite Series Golf come from?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the advances in technology, golf equipment, specifically drivers, are better than they have ever been.   Since billions of dollars are spent on equipment each year, and the technologies are essentially as good as they can get, golf companies needed to find a way to separate themselves from one another.  The only change to be made to the clubs was a cosmetic one.  The first signs of this were the “white head” drivers.  A simple color change that has captured the top spot in the driver market.  So we at Elite Series started to think about what else we could do with the clubs to make them unique.  We started throwing ideas around and with the help of our design team Elite Series Corporate line was born!  We thought, what better way for a company to give a “one of a kind” gift to its key employees or important clients, and actually get marketing/advertising from it!</p>
<p><strong>Golf's Greatest Dad Project</strong></p>
<p>This project came about while the president of our company was xmas shopping for his father this past year.  He just had his first child and was so excited to buy his father a gift that had the words ""GRANDPA"" all over it.    As he spent 3 hours shopping for a gift all he could find was a #1 Grandpa Spatula.  Disappointed to say the least, he felt there had to be better, and now there is!  Elite series golf now plans to roll out not only the Golf's Greatest Dad project but also; mom, grandpa, and grandma.  This way everyone can enjoy a gift that not only looks great but is also thoughtful and functionable.</p>
<p><strong>Our Equipment</strong></p>
<p>Our product is NOT just a novelty.  Our research and development team spent over a year designing our shafts and club heads.  Our shafts are made from pure graphite.  We spared no expense working with cheap knock off shafts made from graphite and fiber glass fillers, ours are 100% pure.  Our club head is a top of the line titanium head built for maximum distance.  Our over-sized face is incredibly forgiving, designed for low spin and a high launch angle.   We wanted to make sure that EVERY golfer gets the best experience from PLAYING our club, not just showing it off.</p>
<p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
<p><strong>*This project is intended as a gift!</strong></p>
<p>Key employee/executives – why not give them something they will actually use, while at the same time advertises for your company!</p>

<p>Marketing/advertising -  Why not give something away that will continue to be used and keep your company on the mind of the consumer.</p>
<p>Charity use – Are you donating to a charity golf outing?  Make a splash with everyone involved when you send our drivers to the event to be given away.  You’ll be the talk of the event for the rest of the year!</p>

<p>We've been thinking about our core values; the 'why' behind the 'what' of Yak Hats.  It didn't take long to discover that freedom, an active lifestyle and time well spent with the people you love is what we value most.  Add to that a bit of a rebellious spirit and a disdain for convention and you have Yak Active, llc.</p>
<p>Because this is who we are, it was only natural that we would want a wearable tech that gives us the freedom to enjoy outdoor activities with the ones we love.  That is why we invented the Yak Hat.  We love em, and we think you will too!</p>

<h3>What are Yak Hats?</h3>
<div>
<p>Have you ever tried to listen to music or take a call while out for a ride or on a run? There is a lot of gear out there to help, but it may not look cool or feel comfortable and fiddling with wires while you are playing outside is a hassle. </p>
<p>Ever tried to talk on the phone outside? If there is any wind, even in the slightest breeze, you have to use the <i>hand cup</i>...  </p>
<blockquote>""Can you hear me now? No? (hand cup over the phone receiver)  How about now?"" </blockquote>
<p>Now you're using two hands to talk on the phone instead of one! How about no hands? Wouldn't it be great to talk hands free? We've been there, so we developed the Yak Hat. Wireless Bluetooth technology so you can listen to music and talk on the phone while staying active. </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">Yak Hats are a functional, hidden piece of tech, that flows naturally with your active lifestyle.  We designed them to be a natural extension of who you are.  Also, the patent pending microphone adds a cool factor that rocks. With the Yak Hat, you can talk on the phone, hands-free, in wind speeds up to 40 mph.  How do we know? We tested it in the back of a speeding truck. Check out our video to see for yourself. It's pretty freakin' awesome!</span></p>
<p>Rather than wear a Bluetooth headset, that makes you look like a Cyborg, or trying to use your speakerphone in your shirt pocket, we developed the Yak Hat with integrated controls and ear buds that can be stowed away when not in use. </p>

</p>
<h3><b>Background Story</b></h3>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>As many of you are aware, Ebola
reached Sierra Leone in late June. I was hoping it would end quickly, but it
hasn't. The issue is becoming more serious and those who are not affected
directly by the disease are indirectly effected via inflation, civil unrest due
to hunger and lack of work, stress from superstition and lack of knowledge, etc.</i></p>
<p><i>As a response to the hunger crisis occurring all across the
three severely effected countries, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, I am going to send food aid to every house in the small, rural village, Bonganema, where I worked last year. <b>With your help, we can sustain 300 people for the next 3 months while their own rice crops mature.</b></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>The Budget Break-Down</b></h3>
<h4><b>Rice &amp; Fees</b></h4>
<p>There are 49 houses and each bag
currently costs $40. Because I cannot send them the rice directly I have
decided to send the money via **Western Union to people that I personally trust.<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">**I have to use WU because they are the only international money
exchange service available in both Bartlesville, OK &amp; near Bonganema in Sierra Leone. </span></p>
<p><span>These costs:</span></p>
<p><i>Rice:</i> 49 X $40 = $1,960</p>
<p>Western Union Fees: per transfer:
$5.00 OK Tax; 10% (USA) WU Fee; $6.98
(SL) WU Fee. (4 Transfers) = $243.96

</p>
<p><span><b>Total Rice &amp; Fees = $2,203.96</b><i></i></span></p>
<h4>Transportation</h4>
<p><span>This
part is hard to determine simply because their economy is so unpredictable at
this moment. In my opinion, the safest route would be to rent a truck on at
least two different occasions. This will cut out the risk associated with being
out in public (around hungry people) with a TON of money and a literal half ton
of rice. The price to rent the truck will have increased, as well as the price
of gasoline.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Potential Fee for renting a truck for 2 days (considering inflation of
gas prices) = $300</span></p>
<h4>The Cool Part</h4>
<p>Here's the best part of all of this:
I already have about $1,000 in donations! So the actual amount I need to
complete this project is:</p>
<p>2,203.96 (Rice &amp; Fees) + $300 (Transport.) - $1,000
(existing) = $1,503.96 (compensation for IndieGoGo) =</p>
<h4>$1575.00 - That's all we need to feed 300 people for 3 months!</h4>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<h4>Why Bonganema?</h4>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In Sierra Leone living in a rural area means you are automatically cut-off from major junctions of trade, typically market style, open air venues. This means you pay more for the food vs. the price the people in the city/ towns pay because of the transportation costs associated with physically getting to the market. During this crisis the number one issue is hunger due to inflated prices of imported staples such as rice, flower, and petroleum. Hunger is the number one issue that leads to civil unrest, violence, abuse, etc. in underdeveloped regions.</span><br/></p>
<p>I spent very long hours with these people during parts of the year when food and water are scarce. I understand who becomes desperate and who uses their wisdom to solve problems for the greater good. Every penny of your donation will go to ensuring these people are properly fed, allowing them the ability to stay in their village during this time of great uncertainty.</p>
<h4>What we're doing: Strategic Planning</h4>
<p><b>Here’s an outline of the plan and the reasoning:</b><span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">*Please keep in mind: When you are in an underdeveloped country and have more resources than the rest of the population, it’s important to try and hide that fact.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Send the money in specific amounts to different people in Sierra Leone. By sending it to different people they will not see the same person going into the Western Union continually, this cuts down the risk of getting robbed coming out of the western union. The amounts will be sent in less than $500 to avoid large fees with Western Union as well as slow travel of the money across the Atlantic.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b>Let the villagers decide how and who to rent a truck from. This is a trust factor and it's important for me to let them figure this out. I want them to rent a truck to minimize contact with other individuals as well as decrease waiting time in public places. This will decrease potential sickly exposure and getting robbed (notice a trend?)<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">They will probably need to go Bo several times; we're talking about a literal half-ton of rice. So I don’t want the same people to go twice, maybe hiring a different drivers will be part of the deal. This cost is estimated in the transportation section of the budget.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 3</b>: Let only the 4 people know what’s going on with the money and flow of the situation. Mr. Kein, the village youth director, Aunty Daneh, my mommy, Michael Vandi, the youngest chief, and Mohamed son of my Mende teacher. <span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">These people will keep track of the money collectively so that if one person puts the money in their pocket, 3 other people will know what is going on.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 4</b>: Try to get some photos of the feast :)</p>
<p>They mention on the phone on September 26th that Freetown is completely cut-off because of issues with Ebola. However, it is still safe for them to travel to Bo, another major city not yet drastically hit by the virus. There is hunger and crisis occurring in this region. There are always reasonable risks associated with this type of situation, but with strategic planning and frequent communication between now and the time the campaign ends, we can guarantee we're taking every precaution necessary to ensure a smooth delivery!</p>

<p><strong>“Together We Fashion”</strong>: bring your words and faces to the catwalk.</p>
<p>I am Natasha, a young fashion designer living in Holland. For my next spring summer collection for <a href=""http://www.nata-ryzh.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NATA RYZH </a>that will be shown in <a href=""http://www.amsterdamfashionweek.com/en/shows/january-2013/nata-ryzh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amsterdam Fashion Week</a> in July 2013, I want to create something very special. I want to merge fashion with social networking by designing and producing a collection made by the community for the community. I call it: Together We Fashion.</p>
<p>And this is how we will do it:</p>
<p><strong>Made by the community:</strong></p>
<p>You send me a picture of your face or your beloved one's, a word or a sentence which has a special meaning to you like a short poem or your favorite quote. I will then use your input with a great creative team to design and produce a beautiful fashionable print for fabric, that I will use for the garments that will be worn by models on the catwalk in July! With your words and your faces!  A politically correct collection, each of you matter, each of you are part of it, like you are part of this world.</p>
<p><strong>Made for the community:</strong></p>
<p>I will employ young fashion industry creatives which will be paid with your contribution. Seamstresses, pattern cutters, photographers, print and graphic designers, all will work together to make it a success! Let’s bring fashion to another level and have fun with it while creating employment opportunities!</p>

Your current location is sent to them and they will feel relieved. You can do this through numerous  complex steps in a smart phone. However, RANG only has one step. You can push it long to call family or loved automatically in emergency. The similar devices have a shutter button. It is convenient but frequently makes mistake in pressing button unintentionally. But Rang has four sensors embedded into the device. Therefore, a light hold of the device will inform the location and minimize the possibility of misusage when running the function.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444637467/s4osqv7cdq35knkk47gq.png"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/LkgDnQB.gif"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"" title=""source: imgur.com""/>

<p>You can enjoy RANG by playing hand motion game.This is good for blood and energy circulation. Also it prevents cardiovascular disorders and dementia. Regardless of where you are at, use RANG to insure your health by enjoying it.  A balloon game is the one of the games that we provide. The game starts by clenching on RANG. You have to insure the balloon gets bigger and bigger just before it pops. </p>

Then I asked her to try on ""I’m okay"" function when she went out with her friends. So she informed me where she was at. I was pleased that she considered me. Also ""I’m okay"" sign made me relieved because I could notice that she was out safe. So I think that RANG made closer with family. </span></p>
<p>/ A man and his wife :<b> </b>In a crowded subway, it was tiresome to take out a phone from the bag on the way home from work. I fist clenched RANG to show my wife where I was at. She was happy to see where I was at because my wife could prepare dinner for me on time. Furthermore, sometimes my wife sends cheer-up fireworks to me when I struggle in working, so I was glad.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444531847/udfs1i6t6td3luwnxfdn.png"" src="""" style=""""/>/ <span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Parents struggle on smart phones : </span><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">My parents don’t know how to use a smart phone. Especially my mom barely sends messages to me. So when she is out, I get numerous spelling mistakes messages from her. It’s hard for my mom to use a keypad to send messages. Therefore, she needs RANG because she can send a warm-hearted emoticon easily. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">/ A memorable moment : There were times when I took a picture to make a good memory. But it was hard for me to make everyone in the picture. So I used RANG to take a selfie and it was convenient for me. <br/></span></p>
<p>/ A mischievous boy and his mother : At one time,<b> </b>I was looking for a phone after watching a movie with my son but I could not find where it was. Also I put it on silent mode in the theatre and that made it more difficult to find. So I used ""finding my phone"" function and the phone rang so loudly from my son’s bookshelf. So later I found out that my son secretly took out a phone from me to play a game and left it on the small gap between the bookshelf.  Nowadays, my son forgets where he left his phone and frequently asks where it is. Later on the day, he tends to find it in unexpected place.</p>

</div>
<p>/ Daily usage of finding phone : My friend was holding my phone to see the pictures on smartphone in the restaurant. Then few minutes later, I rummaged around in my bag for phone. But it was not there. So I went back to the washroom to see if I left it there. Still, I could not find it anywhere. So I used RANG, “find phone” function. The music started to play from my friend’s hand. She had the phone. The phone was under my very eyes. I thought to myself that in life, there are times when I just can’t see things right in front of me. </p>
<p>/ One touch call : I suddenly realized to call my hubby while I was driving because I had to tell him to pick up our daughter from school.  Instead of taking out a phone from the bag, I held on to Rang with my right hand and it automatically called to my hubby. When he answered, I told him to pick her up. Even though this was not the case of emergency, Rang was very handy because I could easily call someone when doing something.</p>

</b><p>/ DNX <br/></p>
<p>DNX is an acronym for “Design for Next eXperience”. It focuses on making wearable devices in the next generation. It is distinguished from existing smart watch and band types. Therefore, we provide a new experience and a new value. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>/ CEO </p>
<p>The CEO has majored in computer science and achieved PhD. She has worked in a laboratory and information and communications company over 10 years. Currently, she is a professor in Kaywon University of Art &amp; Design. The research of IT and design convergence has been started since. She tried to bring out the solutions of how she could creatively integrate technology and design. As a result, she created RANG and established the company this year.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>/ What is RANG </p>
<p>RANG is a fashionable jewelry smart watch. We especially designed the product that’s suited for women. People can stylize the item in various ways like bracelet, necklace and key chain. There are safety functions for women and practical convenient functions. In addition, we have various emoticons and games for fun. All the functions can be done by one touch fist clenching. Furthermore this does not require charging.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>/ What made RANG</p>
<p>It’s a pity that existing products did not meet its growth potential in the wearable market. At present, the most of wearable devices are led by IT companies due to technology and function based. However, we combined computer science with design convergence experiences and produced a fashion centered practical wearable device. We wanted to emphasize on different needs to the users. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>/ How RANG differentiates</p>
<p>All the touch sensors are embedded in the inner part of the device. There are 18 types of controls that can be done in one touch. The product has patent registrations. Also it will take double amount times for other companies to duplicate the product. Therefore, we are proud of RANG’s technique of being the only one. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>/ What were some difficulties while developing the product</p>
<p>The most difficult parts were key sensing algorithms and designing mechanisms. We made many prototypes and spent last two years preparing the product. By separating the upper and lower parts we have expanded the ways to wear the product. We emphasized cost reduction, aesthetic impression, and one touch UI.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>/ How to get after service</p>
<p>Basically, we won’t bring out the product that requires after service. However, when the after service is needed, we will exchange it to the finished product. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>/ Vision</p>
<p>RANG is pretty and practical in daily life. Therefore, it is a perfect gift to the friend or family. We want users to wear the product and be happy with it. We will bring out more outstanding wearable smart device. Overall, we want RANG to be loved by the fashionista as well as the product to be acknowledged as being the number one in the market. </p>

/ DIY Procedure /
We provide only RANG's main device to create your own RANG! Use it to create a unique style! Present the only smart watch to the people near you! 



/ Stylize RANG by yourself /










/ A warm-hearted mother and her daughter : I gave RANG as a gift to my daughter. Then I asked her to try on ""I’m okay"" function when she went out with her friends. So she informed me where she was at. I was pleased that she considered me. Also ""I’m okay"" sign made me relieved because I could notice that she was out safe. So I think that RANG made closer with family. 
/ A man and his wife : In a crowded subway, it was tiresome to take out a phone from the bag on the way home from work. I fist clenched RANG to show my wife where I was at. She was happy to see where I was at because my wife could prepare dinner for me on time. Furthermore, sometimes my wife sends cheer-up fireworks to me when I struggle in working, so I was glad.
/ Parents struggle on smart phones : My parents don’t know how to use a smart phone. Especially my mom barely sends messages to me. So when she is out, I get numerous spelling mistakes messages from her. It’s hard for my mom to use a keypad to send messages. Therefore, she needs RANG because she can send a warm-hearted emoticon easily. 
/ A memorable moment : There were times when I took a picture to make a good memory. But it was hard for me to make everyone in the picture. So I used RANG to take a selfie and it was convenient for me. 
/ A mischievous boy and his mother : At one time, I was looking for a phone after watching a movie with my son but I could not find where it was. Also I put it on silent mode in the theatre and that made it more difficult to find. So I used ""finding my phone"" function and the phone rang so loudly from my son’s bookshelf. So later I found out that my son secretly took out a phone from me to play a game and left it on the small gap between the bookshelf.  Nowadays, my son forgets where he left his phone and frequently asks where it is. Later on the day, he tends to find it in unexpected place.


/ Daily usage of finding phone : My friend was holding my phone to see the pictures on smartphone in the restaurant. Then few minutes later, I rummaged around in my bag for phone. But it was not there. So I went back to the washroom to see if I left it there. Still, I could not find it anywhere. So I used RANG, “find phone” function. The music started to play from my friend’s hand. She had the phone. The phone was under my very eyes. I thought to myself that in life, there are times when I just can’t see things right in front of me. 
/ One touch call : I suddenly realized to call my hubby while I was driving because I had to tell him to pick up our daughter from school.  Instead of taking out a phone from the bag, I held on to Rang with my right hand and it automatically called to my hubby. When he answered, I told him to pick her up. Even though this was not the case of emergency, Rang was very handy because I could easily call someone when doing something.













* Starting from next year,the  transportation card will be available only in Korea .





















/ DNX 
DNX is an acronym for “Design for Next eXperience”. It focuses on making wearable devices in the next generation. It is distinguished from existing smart watch and band types. Therefore, we provide a new experience and a new value. 


/ CEO 
The CEO has majored in computer science and achieved PhD. She has worked in a laboratory and information and communications company over 10 years. Currently, she is a professor in Kaywon University of Art & Design. The research of IT and design convergence has been started since. She tried to bring out the solutions of how she could creatively integrate technology and design. As a result, she created RANG and established the company this year.  


/ What is RANG 
RANG is a fashionable jewelry smart watch. We especially designed the product that’s suited for women. People can stylize the item in various ways like bracelet, necklace and key chain. There are safety functions for women and practical convenient functions. In addition, we have various emoticons and games for fun. All the functions can be done by one touch fist clenching. Furthermore this does not require charging.


/ What made RANG
It’s a pity that existing products did not meet its growth potential in the wearable market. At present, the most of wearable devices are led by IT companies due to technology and function based. However, we combined computer science with design convergence experiences and produced a fashion centered practical wearable device. We wanted to emphasize on different needs to the users. 


/ How RANG differentiates
All the touch sensors are embedded in the inner part of the device. There are 18 types of controls that can be done in one touch. The product has patent registrations. Also it will take double amount times for other companies to duplicate the product. Therefore, we are proud of RANG’s technique of being the only one. 


/ What were some difficulties while developing the product
The most difficult parts were key sensing algorithms and designing mechanisms. We made many prototypes and spent last two years preparing the product. By separating the upper and lower parts we have expanded the ways to wear the product. We emphasized cost reduction, aesthetic impression, and one touch UI.


/ How to get after service
Basically, we won’t bring out the product that requires after service. However, when the after service is needed, we will exchange it to the finished product. 


/ Vision
RANG is pretty and practical in daily life. Therefore, it is a perfect gift to the friend or family. We want users to wear the product and be happy with it. We will bring out more outstanding wearable smart device. Overall, we want RANG to be loved by the fashionista as well as the product to be acknowledged as being the number one in the market. 
/ DNX manifesto
The members of DNX suggest their opinions on debates, discuss positively,  and tries to find the best solutions all together.




In GMV2015 (Global Mobile Vision) conference, DNX's CEO had a presentation in front of the audience. They were interested in the concepts and functions of RANG. As you may be aware, KES (Korea Electronics Show) is one of the most confidential organizations in Korea. Luckily, DNX received an award as the best new product in KES 2015.

<h3>
<span><span>JOCAR</span> is a reflection of ideas that stemmed from cousins </span>Lorenza Awal and Felipe Patterson, two cousins that merged their creativity and sense of style to create unique fashion possibilities.</h3>
<div> </div>
<div>Why Jocar?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jocar is a mirror for who was, who we are and what we are here to represent</div>
<div> “<span>JO</span>”CAR: Our Great Grandfather Jose came from Puerto Rico to New York with little to nothing but his name and family in tote. His then blushing wife Carmen JO""<span>Ca""</span>R, reared our family raising 7 children under the Ramos name. JOCA""<span>R""</span>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since New York is where it all began for cousins Lorenza and Felipe, it’s only fitting to name our venture as close as we can to where it all began. New York born cousins Felipe and Lorenza may live on opposites sides of the map however, the creativity and passion knows no limits. With Lorenza residing in Ft. Lauderdale Florida and Felipe Patterson in St. Paul Minnesota there is not much time to personally connect however the inner spirit creativity and determination for success drives them to truly collaborate and make Couture Urban Wear. To be able to dress the world in our perspective of what urban wear is, is what we set out to do. </div>
<p>We turn to indiegogo because we are in pursuit of obtaining a monetary foundation that will allow us to launch our Clothing line.</p>
<h3>If we reach our goal of $3,000, we will:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The cost for ink and the T-shirts canvas to produce 100 of the M@d Sc!ent!st shirts comes to roughly $1,200.</p>
<p>We will also be printing out business cards stickers and t-shirts with our main logo (in the colors Green, Black, Red &amp; Blue) this will total to $1,000. </p>
<p>With the left over $800 we will use this money to fund our launch party (Location to be determined). This money will help secure the location and pay for the dj and mc that will host the night. We also would like to hand out free glow in the dark jocar t-shirts to the first 75 people that come to the launch party.  </p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, that extra money will be used to create door prizes for those that attend the launch party. Jocar stickers, baller bands and MORE SHIRTS!!! Who doesnt love a free t-shirt?</p>

</div></div>","JOCAR is a reflection of ideas that stemmed from cousins Lorenza Awal and Felipe Patterson, two cousins that merged their creativity and sense of style to create unique fashion possibilities.
 
Why Jocar?
 
Jocar is a mirror for who was, who we are and what we are here to represent
 “JO”CAR: Our Great Grandfather Jose came from Puerto Rico to New York with little to nothing but his name and family in tote. His then blushing wife Carmen JO""Ca""R, reared our family raising 7 children under the Ramos name. JOCA""R""

 
Since New York is where it all began for cousins Lorenza and Felipe, it’s only fitting to name our venture as close as we can to where it all began. New York born cousins Felipe and Lorenza may live on opposites sides of the map however, the creativity and passion knows no limits. With Lorenza residing in Ft. Lauderdale Florida and Felipe Patterson in St. Paul Minnesota there is not much time to personally connect however the inner spirit creativity and determination for success drives them to truly collaborate and make Couture Urban Wear. To be able to dress the world in our perspective of what urban wear is, is what we set out to do. 
We turn to indiegogo because we are in pursuit of obtaining a monetary foundation that will allow us to launch our Clothing line.
If we reach our goal of $3,000, we will:


The cost for ink and the T-shirts canvas to produce 100 of the M@d Sc!ent!st shirts comes to roughly $1,200.
We will also be printing out business cards stickers and t-shirts with our main logo (in the colors Green, Black, Red & Blue) this will total to $1,000. 
With the left over $800 we will use this money to fund our launch party (Location to be determined). This money will help secure the location and pay for the dj and mc that will host the night. We also would like to hand out free glow in the dark jocar t-shirts to the first 75 people that come to the launch party.  
If we exceed our goal, that extra money will be used to create door prizes for those that attend the launch party. Jocar stickers, baller bands and MORE SHIRTS!!! Who doesnt love a free t-shirt?
I myself as a designer have been influenced by many other forms of art whether it be music, poetry or movies. I hope that I can influence the next artist and show by example that if you work hard towards a goal anything is possible.

<h3>...and a dream for us!</h3>

<h3>Félicien Comtat</h3>
<p>A post-graduate Mathematics student in France, yet extremely knowledgeable about

things, and I can always trust him to come up with bright ideas.</p>
<h3>Mathias Sablé</h3>
<p>It's me! I am a post-graduate Computer Science student in France. Probably not as cultivated
as my travelling companion, but I've been sailing for ages and I would like to do it as

<p>It's one of the peculiarities of the English language. She.
Small wonder, because she will be, for a long time, our home, our mode of transport, our way to
accomplish our dream and our way of offering you what you didn't even know you dreamed
about, she is most certainly a full-time member of the Crew!</p>
<h4>An issue here</h4>
<p>To be fair, we do not yet have a yacht. Although we have just enough
funds for an old but steady second-hand yacht, we need funds for our other
expenses (see below).</p>
<p>The good thing is that I have a few boats in mind already, and this would be
the purpose of our first update in case of project success: to show you our brand new
(old) boat!</p>
<p>I am currently looking in New Caledonia and Polynesia, and if you wonder
why — look at the distance between France and New Caledonia and keep in mind
that our goal is to travel to foreign places! Another reason is that a lot of
people sail around the world and end their trip there, hence a high
concentration of second-hand, relatively cheap boats there.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The trip</h2>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435367562/edvq8pkfwxwcu2taitrj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>This trip may change soon depending on where the boat is when bought,
and it may change at the last minute because of the weather forecast:
no, we will not go through typhoons to take pictures for you!</p>
<hr/>
<h2>The budget</h2>
<p>Or <em>why we're asking for this amount of money</em>.
Living entirely on a boat is not expensive. But we will stop and travel to
various places, and mooring a boat somewhere for a few days quickly gets quite
costly.</p>
<p>Estimated budget for a month:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to eat, and everything's done on the boat! $8 * 30 days * 2 people
= <strong>$480</strong>
</li>
<li>We will be moored about half the time and pay for nights spent in
marinas, about $20/night: (1/2) * (30 days * $20) = <strong>$300</strong>
</li>
<li>Even though we will be wind-powered most of the time, which is one of the cheapest ways to
travel, we might have to use the engine from time to time, and fuel is
expensive: about <strong>$20</strong>.</li>
<li>For vaccinations, visas and other formalities, (2 * $40) = <strong>$80</strong>
</li>
<li>For communications (see below), about <strong>$20</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's it. Obviously no hotel or plane or car rental.</p>
<p>So that's about <strong>$900 a month</strong> for two! Although we would love to
travel for several years, we can only take a one year break, and allowing time for
preparation it seems safe to say that we will only travel for 10 months.
Which makes <strong>$9000</strong>.</p>
<p>We require a proper camera to film all this, and we currently do not
have one (as you can tell from our promotional video up there),
that's another <strong>$100</strong> at least.</p>
<p>And because we need to communicate with you at any time, we will need a
satellite phone that works about everywhere. I'm thinking about an Iridium 9505
for example, this is at least another <strong>$400 </strong>if we find a good deal.</p>
<p>That's about <strong>$9500</strong> now.</p>
<p>But now the gifts come into the equation!
As stated, half the price of what you give is for yourself.
So let's double this up, we get <strong>$19000</strong>.</p>
<h3>If there's extra money</h3>
<p>All potential extra money would be used to find a better sailing boat. Which
also means fancier pictures, a longer trip (because we would go faster), and so
on!</p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>The price of shipping gifts will be included in the price of the reward.
That being said, in many cases, we might wait until we are closer to you before
sending them, or wait for a country where shipping prices are lower.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>Because we know you'll like it, and because we will probably change a lot
during the trip, we will take a picture of ourselves <strong>every day</strong> in the same
pose.</p>
<p>And if you have ideas of things for us to do, why not suggest them!
I may very well dance at the top of the mast for you!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am Katherine Walker, Fashion Designer and Owner of Yhta'k (ya-tay) Designs. Yhta'k Designs is a Contemporary-Better clothing line company originally from Chicago now located in Los Angeles.  I need your help in raising funds to attend our 1st Fashion Week! Recently, we opened our design studio in the L.A. Fashion District early in December 2015. This year marks our 7th year in business and we are growing and becoming a household name. Our brands include Katherine Marie misses, Madame Marie Curvy collection and MJW menswear line along with a new Pet wear line. </p>
<p>We have been selected to showcase at L.A. Fashion Week in March 2016 and need funding for this great milestone as well as equipment and supplies.  For as little as $5, anyone who wants to support can make a contribution to Yhta'k and the industry. Also, you can obtain one of our logo tees for a donation of $25! We couldn't have chosen a better show which is connected to the Aids Foundation so your contribution will support AHF.  For the love of fashion and with over 20 years in the Fashion Industry, Katherine has grown Yhta'k from the bottom up and is constantly growing.</p>

<p>Riley Suchanek is a Los Angeles Fashion Designer. She will be showing her first collection at the Ad Hoc show at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Riley has her A.A. in Fashion Design. This will be her first collection since graduation. Designers that most inspire her are Rodarte, Acne, Celine, Dries Van Noten, and Chloe. Her mini collection is considered Abstract Specialty pieces for the contemporary womens market.</p>
<p>Everything from fabrics to models are in order. If you would like to invest in the beginnings of Riley's Fashion career, it would be greatly appreciated. Riley plans to build her portfolio with this mini collection.</p>
<p>Not only is Riley showing in the Ad Hoc Fashion show, she is also producing the show. Work has been scarce to find in the fashion industry at entry level. Therefore, Riley has decided to make her own experience to ad to her resume along side 5 other designers she hand picked to show their collections as well. </p>
<p>The collection will be featured in Ad Hoc's archives.</p>

<h3>We're dog owners. We're active and busy. We've found a solution!</h3>
<p>Let's be honest, there isn't anything incredibly complex or world changing about a Go Post.  But what makes this product special is it might let your dog spend a little extra time with you!  Whether it is traveling to a relative's house who doesn't have a fenced yard, camping in an area unfamiliar to the dog, or simply working in the front yard, the Go Post is the easy solution to ensuring that your dog stays in place!  Simply wrap the leash around a stationary object (current size allows easily for objects up to 4"" in diameter--such as a lamp post, tree branch, hand rail) and clip in the dogs existing leash. </p>
<p><strong>Go Post Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>Go Post is Affordable-No need to install a metal post in the yard, unwieldy chain, or expensive dog run.</p>
<p>Go Post Is Safer-No need to unleash your dog to tie them up.</p>
<p>Go Post is Very Easy to take along anywhere and so lightweight and strong it can be used in a variety of settings!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise enough money by offering you our unique Go Post product to be able to purchase additional equipment, material and services to expand to a broader market.</p>
<p>Goal 1:  Have a functional website designed, built, &amp; launched.<br/></p>
Goal 2:  Acquire commercial grade sewing equipment to allow for quicker production cycles.<br/><br/><p>Goal 3:  Develop better marketing tools to enhance distribution capabilities to reach a broader dog ownership group.</p>
</span></span> <span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">
<p>Our Go Post product is available in Red, Blue, Black, Purple, Green, and Pink! (Actual colors pictured in our Gallery.)  Please let us know what color(s) you'd like when you donate to our campaign.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Importance</h3>
<p>Thank you, already, for reviewing our Indiegogo campaign.  These projects are truly investments of ourselves.  Your contribution to this campaign will have three major areas of impact! </p>
<p>First, on the pet (or pets) you purchase the Go Post for.  This will hopefully allow them to get to travel with you and have experiences they might not have had otherwise.  Second, on other dogs!  As we re-invest and hope to reach a broader audience, a primary objective is to have our products enhance the lives and interactions of humans &amp; dogs everywhere.  This passion starts with, but won't stop with, our Go Post product once it gets rolling!  Finally, on us--our investment of time, efforts, and capital will be constantly rewarded from your level of support.</p>
<h3>The Business Side</h3>
<p>Our goal is to enhance the lives of the pets and their relationship with owners by offering simple products that are not cost prohibitive. With 78.2 million dogs owned in the United States covering 39% of US households, this is a market that is very strong. On average, a US family will spend $58 per month on their pets.  We're hoping to be a small part of that and provide value added products!</p>
<p>The Go Post tether is made of high strength nylon webbing.  Nylon has several advantages over other types of webbing material, including that it is able to withstand ""pulse"" breaks due to its inherent elasticity--this means there is slight give in the tether to ensure it does not snap and fail if your pooch tries to chase down the bacon truck.  We use a heavy duty, commercial grade thread in the stitch with a pattern that is set to ensure maximum strength.  Finally, the carabineer is a mid-strength stainless steel in the pear shape to allow for full strength across the long axis.  All in all, the Go Post tether will easily hold 400 pounds which is greater strength than most leashes on the market.  Additionally, this strength is more than sufficient for most common, regular domestic dog breeds when considering their pull strength.<br/></p>

Our first project - AlcoSenseAlcoSense
is our first project. Research shows that most of the people over-estimate
their alcohol tolerance. This inspired us for creating AlcoSense. 
With

<span class=""notranlsate""><h1></h1></span><span class=""notranlsate""><p>The FREE is not a noun, it's a verb. Having the ability to escape into the open roads of paths less taken. The FREE is a way of life, a selection of people who understand that seeking safety in strangers and trusting that everything will work out is all that matters. Learning from the wide open trails and listening to the soundtrack of the wind blowing through your hair is the only one I want to know. Being FREE is a feeling one has in their soul - not something that can be given or taken away. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>My freedom to be FREE was almost taken from me, along with my life, last year when I was the victim of a horrific motorcycle accident. Leaving me with nothing but a will to survive and the passion to continue on the road I once knew, is all I have left. I had my own clutch handlebar of my Harley Davidson impale my stomach and come out of my back - something you couldn't even imagine. My arm, shattered along with multiple burns from gasoline on the pavement. The road to recovery has only started - I am now left with my arm permanently at a 90degree angle and a wandering mind of ""what could have been"". Yet, i refuse to let the fire inside of me burn out. I am free... the open road is all that calls my name and I am going to get back on a bike when the time is right and feel the wind against my face. Until then, I have created something that incorporates everything I believe in... and I couldn't be happier. Let me introduce you to... the FREE. <br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This same passion for motorcycles, 
vintage memorabilia and everything to do with the things that made America 
strong, free and beautiful have inspired this line of mens clothing and 
accessories. Every shirt is hand printed by myself and my partner, while every aspect of leather crafting is done by me to not only insure quality - but also as an art therapy tool to help with my recovery from my accident. This line of specialty t-shirts made only for IndieGoGo are inspired by my accident and creating awareness for other riders as well. </p>
<p>Buy purchasing these t-shirts you are providing awareness to riders and to motorists all around the country to WATCH OUT FOR MOTORCYCLES and that loud pipes, which get your attention, can and do save lives. Please let the riders ride, and let them live. Let riding a motorcycle be what its meant for - being FREE - and not just a death trap. Let Ride, Let Live. </p>
<p>I personally thank you for looking twice and listening for motorcycles around you and appreciate you taking the time to look into this uncanny opportunity for me. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding for this project will allow us to produce our line of men's clothing and accessories.  We will be able to purchase all materials necessary for production, i.e. t-shirts, leather and every little bit and piece for us to continue making our products by our own hands. We take pride in having all of our garments &amp; accessories handmade by us in California, USA and would love to make sure this always stays as just that. Once we have a good amount of inventory we will be able to launch our website, get on the road and bring our shirts, koozies and key chains to music festivals and boutiques around the country - therefore continuing to support small business in America. <br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Breaking It Down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally our company would need about $10,00 for supplies, and start up costs.<br/>
</li>
<li>You are contributing to a cause, while also getting a Made in USA vintage style garment and/or accessory. </li>
<li>Fashion has great influence on not only those who wear it, but those inspired by it. <br/>
</li>
<li>With little to no donations OR with a wonderful new following of donations - The FREE will continue to aspire to create a lifestyle brand that promotes ""America the Beautiful"" bringing back that American pride and nostalgia. </li>
<li>The FREE is thankful for you taking the time to read into our cause - regardless of donations, we proudly thank you. </li>

<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What style are these shirts? </span>The FREE is inspired by all things vintage and nostalgic USA - so all shirts are given that vintage-style look and appearance. Our moto is: ""The more you wear it, the better it looks - don't be afraid to live FREE"".</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What are my style options?</span> Option One: ""Loud Pipes Save Lives"". Option Two: ""Don't Tread On Me"". <br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">What are my color options?</span> The color options to choose from are: Option One: ""Vintage Grey"" &amp; Option Two:""Classic Black"". The print on the Vintage Grey shirts is Black &amp; the print on the Classic Black shirts is White. <br/>
</li>

<h3>VINTAGE FLANNELS : FAQ</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">How do i choose my flannel color/style/size?</span> All we need is your size - knowing that each flannel is handpicked by The FREE and each is different from the next. This is what gives the flannels such great character! They will all be from the 80s &amp; 90s - modern fits without the modern labels - we strive to go for the vintage American ""lumberjack/blue collar workforce"" appeal, with our color pallets being reds, browns, blues, greens, neutrals. This process truly makes each garment one of a kind. </li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Is my flannel mass produced?</span> No. We, The FREE, are only releasing a limited edition amount of 50 flannels with the design ""Loud Bikes, Fast Women, Old Whiskey"" on the back. We hand print these designs in California, USA and each one is unique to itself. Once sold out, we will no longer be carrying this design - therefore keeping your flannel original and very sought after! Don't miss out!<br/>

This line of specialty t-shirts made only for IndieGoGo are inspired by my accident and creating awareness for other riders as well. 
Buy purchasing these t-shirts you are providing awareness to riders and to motorists all around the country to WATCH OUT FOR MOTORCYCLES and that loud pipes, which get your attention, can and do save lives. Please let the riders ride, and let them live. Let riding a motorcycle be what its meant for - being FREE - and not just a death trap. Let Ride, Let Live. 
I personally thank you for looking twice and listening for motorcycles around you and appreciate you taking the time to look into this uncanny opportunity for me. 





What We Need & What You Get
The funding for this project will allow us to produce our line of men's clothing and accessories.  We will be able to purchase all materials necessary for production, i.e. t-shirts, leather and every little bit and piece for us to continue making our products by our own hands. We take pride in having all of our garments & accessories handmade by us in California, USA and would love to make sure this always stays as just that. Once we have a good amount of inventory we will be able to launch our website, get on the road and bring our shirts, koozies and key chains to music festivals and boutiques around the country - therefore continuing to support small business in America. 
Breaking It Down:

Ideally our company would need about $10,00 for supplies, and start up costs.

You are contributing to a cause, while also getting a Made in USA vintage style garment and/or accessory. 
Fashion has great influence on not only those who wear it, but those inspired by it. 

With little to no donations OR with a wonderful new following of donations - The FREE will continue to aspire to create a lifestyle brand that promotes ""America the Beautiful"" bringing back that American pride and nostalgia. 
The FREE is thankful for you taking the time to read into our cause - regardless of donations, we proudly thank you. 







TSHIRTS: FAQ



Is my t-shirt mass produced? No. All t-shirts are 'Made in USA' and hand printed by The FREE in our California, USA studio - giving each print its own character. 

What style are these shirts? The FREE is inspired by all things vintage and nostalgic USA - so all shirts are given that vintage-style look and appearance. Our moto is: ""The more you wear it, the better it looks - don't be afraid to live FREE"".

What are my style options? Option One: ""Loud Pipes Save Lives"". Option Two: ""Don't Tread On Me"". 


What are my color options? The color options to choose from are: Option One: ""Vintage Grey"" & Option Two:""Classic Black"". The print on the Vintage Grey shirts is Black & the print on the Classic Black shirts is White. 


What are my size options? How is the fit? The size fits a modern style with a relaxed fit and loose crew neckline - sizes range from XS-XL





VINTAGE FLANNELS : FAQ



How do i choose my flannel color/style/size? All we need is your size - knowing that each flannel is handpicked by The FREE and each is different from the next. This is what gives the flannels such great character! They will all be from the 80s & 90s - modern fits without the modern labels - we strive to go for the vintage American ""lumberjack/blue collar workforce"" appeal, with our color pallets being reds, browns, blues, greens, neutrals. This process truly makes each garment one of a kind. 

Is my flannel mass produced? No. We, The FREE, are only releasing a limited edition amount of 50 flannels with the design ""Loud Bikes, Fast Women, Old Whiskey"" on the back. We hand print these designs in California, USA and each one is unique to itself. Once sold out, we will no longer be carrying this design - therefore keeping your flannel original and very sought after! Don't miss out!

CUSTOMER REVIEWSWe love our customers and they love us back. Hear what they are saying:
""The scarf is gorgeous!  I love the quality and the obvious care with

Companies with a Cause  
OUR STORYI am a strong proponent for equal opportunities for all and passionate about
empowering women. I knew that, one day, I will be working towards gender equality and bringing opportunities for advancement for  women everywhere. Born and raised in India, I saw first hand the cultural, financial and societal stigmas and challenges facing women in
India. I have a PhD in Biomedical Engineering and as a
scientist, I focused my research on identifying early Parkinson's disease.  I also volunteer for education causes. In fact, that is how we decided to partner with CDDP, after I was involved in another project with them for several years.I love numbers. I have researched all the mind numbing statistics on poverty and plight of women worldwide. More than 2 billion people on this planet live on
less than $2 per day, that is 43% of people in the developing world. Of the poor, 6
out of 10 are women. I want to make a dent in these numbers. I knew I needed to do something and now! So, I founded Uchit (which meant leaving some aspects of science behind).We start by providing opportunities
for advancement to women artisans who find it increasing hard to earn a reasonable
livelihood. Numerous studies confirm that financial independence of
women leads to the well-being of the entire family. Our support to women is a step in that direction.The mission is real and the vision for Uchit is achievable. With your support, we will get there. On the lighter side, I love gardening, baking, hiking with my dog, sometimes joined by my kids and to curl up with a good book.FAQs

How can I choose the colors I want ?Not to worry! We receive your contact 
information when you contribute. We will reach out to you soon after to confirm the color and size you would like. 
I am an international supporter. How do I calculate
shipping charges for multiple perks?

</p><h3><b>WE DID
ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING – NOW WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO HELP US FUND THE PROJECT!</b></h3>
<p><br/></p><p>At
this point we really need your help funding production… We have already
invested countless hours of hard work, as well as a substantial amount of money,
into the project. We need extra capital to be able to secure a supply of
quality materials for production and to pay the workers immediately!</p>
<p>While
testing the products we detected considerable interest from shoe retailers and
some smaller companies (for promotional use). The prospects of obtaining credit
in a Europe still trembling from the economic
crisis (banks not loaning money to start-ups, for example) are very unfavorable,
and payment periods may be as long as 120 days.</p>
<p>So
we decided to put all our hopes on an Indiegogo campaign; supporters will
receive a <b>great value for their money as
well as hand-made, high-quality products</b>; they will help us get our
business running and <b>will provide
employment to out of work textile workers</b>. And last but not least, by
working together we'll also <b>help a local
animal shelter</b>. </p>
<p>We
also invite you to help us improve our product! Post your opinion, advice or
critique on our Facebook and we'll get back to you ASAP! Our web page will be
fully operational after the end of this campaign on Indiegogo.</p>

<p>The
founders were born in 1988. They met in high school in Ljubljana, where they became best friends.
They've been best friends ever since. Klemen, who initially came up the idea for
Housemates, shared his idea with Jano, who saw that it had great potential. </p>
<p><b>Klemen</b> was
a member of the Slovenian national gymnastics team for 13 years. He also
starred in the FOX TV show Survivor (he lasted 47 days) and spent a year in New
Zealand as part of his gymnastics training.</p>
<p><b>Jano</b> studied
entrepreneurship in Slovenia
and Spain.
He's deeply involved with philantrophy and was a president of Leo Club Ljubljana for 2 years.
He's interested in electric mobility and is involved with a startup called
<a href=""http://viaverde.si/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ViaVerde</a>, which specializes in electric mobility.</p>

<p><b>Are Housemates washable?</b></p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Yes,
you can wash them in a washing machine (30°C / 86°F ). But we recommend wiping them with a wet
cloth.</p>
<p><b>Will the slippers shrink if you wash them in the washing machine?</b></p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Our

<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Yes.
We ship Housemates all over the globe.</p>
<p><b>What are the shipping costs?</b></p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>None.
Shipping costs are already included.</p>

the campaign layout had taken shape, we were advised by some people to use the shorter promotional
video. But because we had so much fun making the longer video, we decided to
keep it anyway! The first video shows Housemates in action (well, in a
dream actually... don’t worry it’ll all make sense!). The video stars the
founders and our friends. Here is also a short version of the video just to show how useful and cool the Housemates Slippers really are!

WHY HOUSEMATES SLIPPERS?
We
designed them to be worn OVER your shoes.
PROBLEMS SOLVED:

Never feel
impolite for asking visitors to take off their shoes – have a cool alternative
instead!


Keep
outside germs away from your child’s room and play area 

No need to
spend hours cleaning the floor after your guests leave  
THE BACTERIA SHOES BRING IN YOUR HOMENine different
kinds of pathogens can thrive on shoes, according to a study conducted by the University of Arizona in 2008. Good
Morning America tested the bottoms of eight different pairs of shoes, as well
as two dogs' paws, for bacteria. Shoes contained the most bacteria of all — 66
million organisms. Nine microbial
species that can cause intestinal, urinary, eye, lung and blood infections were
identified on the samples..
Children under the
age of 2 are the most vulnerable to the germs we track into the home because
they play on the floor and put their hands in their mouths an average of 80
times an hour.HAVE YOU
EVER... 
... noticed an
embarrassing hole in your socks after taking off your shoes at a friend's home?...been
embarassed by that odor from your feet after a long day of wearing your shoes?... felt uncomfortable
putting on those slippers intended for guests when you know they’ve probably
been used hundreds of times?

… and these are only some of the most common shoe-related
problems at home.


FOR YOUR GUESTS: 

Having a lot of
friends over? Be unique and offer them a stylish alternative to taking off
their shoes! 

TIME SAVERS - no need to take your shoes off
How many times did
you walk out the door, only to remember you forgot your car keys, cell phone,
etc.?… Pop your Housemates on, save time and keep your home clean!
BOATS: 
Proud of your shiny boat? Keep it that way! Offer your guests Housemates! A special
design featuring your boat’s name is also available!

(Please note that the handy tags/loops are positioned differently on the newer models. They are also much shorter.)
CARS and CARAVANS (RVs): 
How many times have your friends forgotten their spare shoes at home after hiking or a game of
tennis? Cleaning the upholstery in your car is now a thing of the past! Give
your passengers a pair of Housemates!



HOME USE

ages and shoe sizes!

EDITION OPTIONS
Why the US flag
inspired Housemates? Two reasons; 
1.- It’s a tribute to Indiegogo, a US-based business, for making it possible
for anybody to start a business from scratch. 
2.- Because the pattern was quite a challenge to make due to the stars. Of course we can make any design, any flag. We will offer a larger variety
once our business is up and running, with YOUR help... (Of course, our families
proudly wear the ""Slovenian"" edition of Housemates at home.) :)
REWARDS: 
Hand-made in Slovenia,
European Union

We all
like high-quality products. That's
why we decided to keep production, regardless of the scale, right here in
Slovenia instead of outsourcing it to the Far East. This also allows us to
oversee all phases of production and distribution.
Due to the economic crisis, several thousand workers in
the textile industry have lost their jobs (a relatively large number,
considering Slovenia’s
population is only 2 million). 
By helping us begin productionon any scale YOU can help
these workers, most of whom live in low income areas of our country. Since
these workers were previously employed in the Mura clothing plant, which made
clothes for prestigious brands like.Hugo Boss, we will be able to provide high-quality
handmade products that are made in Europe.

High quality materials are used to produce the slippers.
Stiching and materials are strong and durable and machine washable at 30°C (86°F). Housemates are fully
recyclable.
They won't fall off, no matter how hard you try! :)
WE DID
ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING – NOW WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO HELP US FUND THE PROJECT!
At
this point we really need your help funding production… We have already
invested countless hours of hard work, as well as a substantial amount of money,
into the project. We need extra capital to be able to secure a supply of
quality materials for production and to pay the workers immediately!
While
testing the products we detected considerable interest from shoe retailers and
some smaller companies (for promotional use). The prospects of obtaining credit
in a Europe still trembling from the economic
crisis (banks not loaning money to start-ups, for example) are very unfavorable,
and payment periods may be as long as 120 days.
So
we decided to put all our hopes on an Indiegogo campaign; supporters will
receive a great value for their money as
well as hand-made, high-quality products; they will help us get our
business running and will provide
employment to out of work textile workers. And last but not least, by
working together we'll also help a local
animal shelter. 
We
also invite you to help us improve our product! Post your opinion, advice or
critique on our Facebook and we'll get back to you ASAP! Our web page will be
fully operational after the end of this campaign on Indiegogo.

<p></p><h1>The Ma’mitons Story</h1><br/><p>Ma’mitons connects people to nature with fashionable,
handmade and environmentally-friendly products. Each product is hand-crafted by
a Cameroonian artisan with natural materials, love and care. There is more to
this than just creating beautiful fashion. As the designer and founder of
Ma’mitons and a native of Cameroon, I want to connect my culture to the rest of
the world with my unique designs, while preserving the environment by using
natural resources and the know-how of Cameroonian artisans. </p>
<p>My roots are a deep part of Ma’mitons designs. In fact, my
company’s name is an affectionate nickname given to me by my family in the
memory of my great grandmother.</p>
<p>Ma’mitons is about global consciousness, social
responsibility and ethical awareness. The artisans I have carefully selected
from all over Cameroon use their craftsmanship to give life to my unique
designs. They are given the opportunity to use their skills, and they are fairly
paid for their work. Together, we create incredible fashion that combines
traditional techniques and modern designs. Wearing Ma’mitons makes a statement for
you and about you.</p>
<p><b>Ma’mitons products are made with leaves called raffia </b>that
come from palm trees that grow naturally in the forests of Cameroon. Raffia is
naturally very soft and durable, which makes our products soft and durable as
well. Raffia
is a versatile natural resource that has many uses. It is commonly used
in the area of textiles and in construction. My great grandmother used raffia
to build her hut and make her own wine. We make sure every step of our
manufacturing process is non-detrimental to the environment.</p>
<p>I am dedicated to giving back. One way Ma’mitons does this
is by donating a
percentage of our sales to SOS Children's Villages, the world's largest
charity dedicated to building families and communities for orphaned, abandoned
and foster children. SOS Children's Villages supports over 500 Villages in 133
countries.  </p>
<p>Ma’mitons currently has a line of handbags and I'm crowdfunding to raise the money to launch my recently designed
line of sandals and accessories.</p>
<p><u>Ma’mitons main goals:</u></p>
<p><b>1. 
</b><b>Provide
you with unique, beautiful, fashionable, handmade products;</b></p>
<p><b>2. 
</b><b>Help
protect the environment;</b></p>
<p><b>3. 
</b><b>Create
more jobs to help the artisans improve their economic status.</b></p>
<p>I cannot do this alone. Please help me spread the word and
share this project everywhere! </p>

<p>In order to grow my company and provide employment to more
Cameroonian artisans, I really need to increase my manufacturing
capability to produce more handbags and increase my product offerings. With my
current revenue stream, I do not have the ability to take advantage of
economies of scale, quickly produce inventory and harvest raw materials.</p>
<p>With Indiegogo, I am able to offer you great products at a
more affordable price. Additionally, I will only produce what you want, and
your choices will help me with my future lines. By contributing to this project
you will help me with my goals, and you will also become part of the Ma’mitons
family. Together we will be a community of like-minded people who can inspire
each other to live better and healthier lives. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1>How Will The Money Be Used If The Ma’mitons Project Is Funded</h1>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>I will
cover all costs associated with the production and delivery of your perks</b>: This means
hiring more artisans, purchasing and harvesting raw materials in large
quantities, taking advantage of discounts on supplies by buying in large
quantities, and saving on shipping charges from Cameroon to the U.S. Costs
will also help with hiring local personnel to fulfill orders more effectively.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>I will
increase capacity and organizational operations</b>: Much of my success so far is
due to the support that I receive from family, friends, volunteers and the
part-time artisans who currently work with me. I alone manage Ma’mitons. This
means hiring employees in Cameroon and the U.S. to run the company more
efficiently. It also means renting a central location for the artisans to work,
renting a warehouse space to maintain inventory, supplies and raw materials. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>I will
expand my line of handbags and add new styles</b>: This means offering you an
even better quality of handmade handbags using the best natural materials while
still preserving the environment. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Using the
designs I have created, I will launch my line of sandals and my line of
accessories</b>: This means offering you more Ma’mitons products to choose from
that will nicely complement my current handbag line.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>I will attend
a reputable tradeshow as an exhibitor</b>: This means the opportunity to show
Ma’mitons to hundreds of buyers that can potentially place wholesale orders. With
your support, Ma’mitons can be available at your favorite stores.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1>Why $50,000</h1><p></p><p>                         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/588198/files/20140518172103-Goal_graph.png?1400458863"" src="""" style=""width: 339.9136069114471px; height: 366px;""/></p>The $50,000 goal may seem like a lot, but the complexities
and challenges of working with the artisans in Cameroon can be costly. In fact,
it costs more to produce the same products today than it will if I am able to
expand, making Ma’mitons even more affordable to you. Not to mention that I
will be able to hire more artisans. <p></p><p></p>
<p>I do not outsource from another company, I work directly
with the artisans and spend a lot of time in Cameroon doing so. </p>
<p>Additionally, the average rate for a standard 10 by 10 booth

the tradeshow (booth design, shipping, storage, tradeshow services, promotion
and marketing materials).</p><p>I have already invested on an inventory of almost 500 handbags to be able to show appreciation to the first people to support my project. Thank you again for your support!<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1>What Will Happen If The Ma’mitons Project Is Overfunded</h1>
<p>·<span> 
</span>I will start training programs to diversify my

<p>·<span> 
</span>I will help the artisans become more efficient
by providing them with better weaving equipment such as looms, better
transportation to and from the forests such as bikes, and additional training
on harvesting raffia from the forests.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>I will purchase the necessary equipment to manufacture
packaging, produce graphic and embroidery work in-house rather than outsourcing.
This will reduce my manufacturing costs and I will be able to employ more
artisans.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>I will expand into other markets, design and
launch new lines. Why not a men’s line?</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>I will introduce other natural materials
available in Cameroon into my designs such as cork and woven ropes. Harvesting
them requires additional equipment and artisans with different skills, but with
your help it might be possible.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>I will be able to give back even more!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1>Who Can Wear Ma’mitons</h1><p><b>Everyone!</b> We may have different backgrounds, come from different cultures and have different styles, but we all have a need for fashion that is functional, affordable, beautiful and makes us feel good.

<p>I realize that creating and delivering a handmade product is
a complicated process and it might come with unexpected problems. This is why
the artisans and I have been preparing and we are confident that we can deliver
your perks to you on time.</p>
<p>The major challenge I face with this type of company is
maintaining a consistently high quality product. I understand that you want to
receive products that are consistent with what you ordered. But please understand
that the artisans I work with are not machines. They make mistakes (we all do) and
that is the reality of creating a handmade product. I am committed to building
a company that makes a difference and I embrace the challenges involved. It
takes creativity and thoughtful communication to create a win-win situation for
everyone. I will keep you informed throughout the production process. If I find
that I cannot meet the deadline, I will notify you. I will not let you down! </p>

<p></p><p></p><p><b>I am new to crowd funding.
How does it work?</b></p>
<p>Crowd funding is the collective effort of individuals who
pool their money to support efforts initiated by other people or organizations.
Every project creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline. If people
like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen.</p><p><b>I am having trouble with
Paypal or am not sure that my payment went through.  What can I do to complete my contribution?</b></p>
<p>If you are having any trouble at all contributing via

me at service@mamitons.com.  I will do
everything I can to smooth it out and make it as simple as possible for you.</p><p><b>What if I don't see a perk level that I am interested in? </b></p>
<p>I want to make this as easy as possible for you. Please

latest. If somewhere along the way I find that I cannot meet the deadline, I
will notify you. </p><p><b>When can I choose styles, sizes
and colors?</b></p>
<p>After you pledge your support, I will receive your
contact information. At the end of the project, I will send you a link to a
page with a form to fill out where you can chose your styles, sizes and colors. For the early bird perk, the form to fill out will be send to you within a few days. </p><p><b>Is shipping included?</b></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p>Domestic shipping is included in the perks prices.
For international orders, please add $35 to your perk amount.</p><p></p><p><b><b>Where can I buy from Ma'mitons after the project ends?</b></b></p><b>
</b><p>You can always find my latest designs on my website at <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mamitons.com</a>.</p><p><b>Do you take custom orders?</b></p>
<p>I might be able to accommodate your request. Please email me
at service@mamitons.com with more
information.</p><p><b>What about returns and exchanges?</b></p><p></p><p>
</p><p>If you are not completely happy with your perks, you will be
able to exchange them for something else of similar value. I will personally
work with you to make sure you receive perks that you love. Unfortunately,
given the nature of the Indiegogo model, I cannot accept returns.</p><p><b>How do I care for my Ma'mitons products?</b></p><p></p><p>As raffia is a natural fiber, it is important to remember that
natural fibers respond well to natural cleansers. Do not use harsh chemicals on
stains. Use a small amount of water to spot clean only as required. If it rains
on your Ma’mitons products or if they get wet, simply let them dry thoroughly
before using them again. Colors of your products may soften over time. Please
note that this potential variation is a characteristic of natural materials.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1>Thank You!</h1>
<p>I owe an incredible amount of thanks to a lot of people and
I apologize in advance to the ones that I am forgetting. I really want to thank
all the people that have supported me over the years and those that helped me
create this Indiegogo project. </p>
<p>Thank you to my parents back in Cameroon. I could not have
done this without you. I love you so much and no words can even explain how I

The Ma’mitons StoryMa’mitons connects people to nature with fashionable,
handmade and environmentally-friendly products. Each product is hand-crafted by
a Cameroonian artisan with natural materials, love and care. There is more to
this than just creating beautiful fashion. As the designer and founder of
Ma’mitons and a native of Cameroon, I want to connect my culture to the rest of
the world with my unique designs, while preserving the environment by using
natural resources and the know-how of Cameroonian artisans. 
My roots are a deep part of Ma’mitons designs. In fact, my
company’s name is an affectionate nickname given to me by my family in the
memory of my great grandmother.
Ma’mitons is about global consciousness, social
responsibility and ethical awareness. The artisans I have carefully selected
from all over Cameroon use their craftsmanship to give life to my unique
designs. They are given the opportunity to use their skills, and they are fairly
paid for their work. Together, we create incredible fashion that combines
traditional techniques and modern designs. Wearing Ma’mitons makes a statement for
you and about you.
Ma’mitons products are made with leaves called raffia that
come from palm trees that grow naturally in the forests of Cameroon. Raffia is
naturally very soft and durable, which makes our products soft and durable as
well. Raffia
is a versatile natural resource that has many uses. It is commonly used
in the area of textiles and in construction. My great grandmother used raffia
to build her hut and make her own wine. We make sure every step of our
manufacturing process is non-detrimental to the environment.
I am dedicated to giving back. One way Ma’mitons does this
is by donating a
percentage of our sales to SOS Children's Villages, the world's largest
charity dedicated to building families and communities for orphaned, abandoned
and foster children. SOS Children's Villages supports over 500 Villages in 133
countries.  
Ma’mitons currently has a line of handbags and I'm crowdfunding to raise the money to launch my recently designed
line of sandals and accessories.
Ma’mitons main goals:
1. 
Provide
you with unique, beautiful, fashionable, handmade products;
2. 
Help
protect the environment;
3. 
Create
more jobs to help the artisans improve their economic status.
I cannot do this alone. Please help me spread the word and
share this project everywhere!

that the artisans I work with are not machines. They make mistakes (we all do) and
that is the reality of creating a handmade product. I am committed to building
a company that makes a difference and I embrace the challenges involved. It
takes creativity and thoughtful communication to create a win-win situation for
everyone. I will keep you informed throughout the production process. If I find
that I cannot meet the deadline, I will notify you. I will not let you down! 
Feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions or
concerns at service@mamitons.com.FAQs
I am new to crowd funding.
How does it work?
Crowd funding is the collective effort of individuals who
pool their money to support efforts initiated by other people or organizations.
Every project creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline. If people
like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen.I am having trouble with
Paypal or am not sure that my payment went through.  What can I do to complete my contribution?
If you are having any trouble at all contributing via
Paypal, or if you want to confirm that your payment went through, please email
me at service@mamitons.com.  I will do
everything I can to smooth it out and make it as simple as possible for you.What if I don't see a perk level that I am interested in? 
I want to make this as easy as possible for you. Please
email me at service@mamitons.com and I will try to accommodate you by finding a perk level that is
similar or creating a new perk level just for you.When will I receive my perks?All perks will ship by the end of September 2014 at the
latest. If somewhere along the way I find that I cannot meet the deadline, I
will notify you. When can I choose styles, sizes
and colors?
After you pledge your support, I will receive your
contact information. At the end of the project, I will send you a link to a
page with a form to fill out where you can chose your styles, sizes and colors. For the early bird perk, the form to fill out will be send to you within a few days. Is shipping included?Domestic shipping is included in the perks prices.
For international orders, please add $35 to your perk amount.Where can I buy from Ma'mitons after the project ends?
You can always find my latest designs on my website at www.mamitons.com.Do you take custom orders?
I might be able to accommodate your request. Please email me
at service@mamitons.com with more
information.What about returns and exchanges?
If you are not completely happy with your perks, you will be
able to exchange them for something else of similar value. I will personally
work with you to make sure you receive perks that you love. Unfortunately,
given the nature of the Indiegogo model, I cannot accept returns.How do I care for my Ma'mitons products?As raffia is a natural fiber, it is important to remember that
natural fibers respond well to natural cleansers. Do not use harsh chemicals on
stains. Use a small amount of water to spot clean only as required. If it rains
on your Ma’mitons products or if they get wet, simply let them dry thoroughly
before using them again. Colors of your products may soften over time. Please
note that this potential variation is a characteristic of natural materials.Thank You!
I owe an incredible amount of thanks to a lot of people and
I apologize in advance to the ones that I am forgetting. I really want to thank
all the people that have supported me over the years and those that helped me
create this Indiegogo project. 
Thank you to my parents back in Cameroon. I could not have
done this without you. I love you so much and no words can even explain how I
really feel. 
Thank you to my sisters for always being there for me and to
you my dear brother, I will forever be grateful for everything you have done
for me and I love you so much.  
Thank you to all the artisans and volunteers for all your
hard work, you are greatly appreciated. 
Thank you to all of you for taking the time to look at my
project. A special thank you to those that will pledge their support. I
appreciate you all beyond belief. 
Finally but not least, thank you to Indiegogo for creating a
platform for small businesses like mine, to tell our stories and hopefully
receive the financial backing we need to grow our businesses!

<h3>I am here to introduce Shadys, the<strong> WORLD's FIRST fully interchangeable sunglasses</strong>!</h3>
<h3>We have spent months working with engineers and designers working to find the best method to accomplish our goal of allowing for the easiest, yet strongest way to have interchangeable frames, stems, and lenses, and we did so with our patent pending mechanism!</h3>
<h3>Our dual stage mechanism uses Neodymium Disk Magnets 1/32” thick, recessed into each half of our fastener. <strong>To lock and unlock the frames from the stems, all you need to do is line up the magnets on the hinge of the frames and the stems, and then they will “click” together. Then just turn the stem slightly and they are locked in place.</strong> Both halves of the mechanism are precision machined, accurate to one hundredths of an inch to ensure that the parts operate smoothly, yet maintain a tight fit.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Patent Pending System"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://shadyeyedeas.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Slide-2-976x550.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mechanism""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>We didn’t just design the mechanism to be sleek; we engineered the sunglasses' body from the ground up, with durability and comfort in mind. The ergonomic design of the frames and stems allow for maximum user comfort, and the flexibility in the frame allows for increased durability. This flexibility in the frames and lenses, as well as due to the design of the groove system the lenses sits in, allows for the easy interchanging of lenses. Simply applying pressure from the back of the lenses will allow them to pop out, and let you put new ones in. For safety reasons, the lenses are not designed to pop out from the back.  </h3>

<h2>Lets do some <em>Shady Math</em>:</h2>
<h3>1 Pair of Shadys – A pair that represents you!</h3>
<h3>If you own 2 pairs you can make<strong> 16</strong> pairs of Shadys – A different pair every day of the week!</h3>
<h3>If you own 3 pairs you can make <strong>81</strong> pairs of Shadys – A different pair every week, for a year!</h3>
<h3>If you own 4 pairs you can make <strong>256</strong> pairs of Shadys – A lot of pairs of Shadys!</h3>
<h3>In the beginning we will offer 8 different frames, and stems. We will even offer 4 different lens colors.</h3>
<h3>If you own the entire <a href=""http://www.shadyeyedeas.com/collection"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Collection"">Collection</a>, you can make 2048 pairs of Shadys!</h3>

<h2><strong>Manufacturing:</strong></h2>
<h3>We have been in touch with manufacturers for the past several months to determine the delivery times, and costs of manufacturing which is why we are here on Indiegogo.</h3>
<h3><strong><strong>We determined that the best way for us to manufacture Shadys, from both a quality and cost perspective, is to use plastic injection. Unfortunatly, plastic injection is only a viable option if we manfuacture in bulk, becuase of the expensive setup costs associated, including the purchasing of moulds, and tooling costs.</strong></strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>If our goal funding is successfully completed we will be able to purchase the necessary </strong><strong>final prototypes, </strong><strong>production molds,  and then bring Shady Eye-deas to life, all in time for you to wear this summer! </strong>

<h3>Aveserico</h3>
<p>Is Latin for bird silk, and that is what I am making, Silk Birds!   I am a passionate wildlife photographer, and I love taking photos of birds in particular.  I started manipulating the photos, changing the colors and exposures in ways that make them somehow even more beautiful.  I posted the designs on my facebook page under the heading ""Silk Scarves"", and very soon people were wanting to have them!  It was just an artistic concept to begin with, but I thought I would go ahead and run with it.   I had a test run of 10 scarves made and they were even more beautiful that I imagined, and they sold out immediately.  I reinvested that money into making more scarves and soon had 30 more scarves.  Everyone that saw one wanted one, and I became very excited about this project.  </p>
<p>I, myself, am a devoted scarf wearer, in fact it is the only accessory I ever wear. To be a scarf designer seemed like a wonderful and logical step in my varied career path.  I LOVE doing this.  Every aspect of it.  The photography, the seeking, the ideas, the colors, the patterns, and even the setbacks.  But it is the end product, the scarves themselves, that have been the most exciting.  I kid you not, they are drop dead gorgeous.  Silk is a vibrant and perfect medium for this wearable art.  </p>
<p>Silk scarves are strong and durable and very useful.  I hope to bring this beauty and utility that is inspired by the natural world to everyone!  See for yourself in my video or on my webpage!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But I need YOUR help.  I put the first two scarf runs on my credit cards, and the powers that be suggest that I no get into further debt by doing that again.  This is how you can help:</p>
<p>I think that 5000 dollars will be enough to produce a sizeable run of scarves, and with the help of some volunteer representatives I think I can get these scarves into the marketplace where EVERYONE can have them!</p>
<p>All of the money raised will go into production costs.  And future profits will go back into the company to create even more beautiful scarves.  Eventually I hope to make this my full time day job while keeping my (woefully underpaid) nightjob as a musician.  Invest in Aveserico!   You will love it!</p>
<p>And for your contribution you will get some really cool stuff!   Like music, and art, and a scarf of your own choosing!  </p>

But I need YOUR help.  I put the first two scarf runs on my credit cards, and the powers that be suggest that I no get into further debt by doing that again.  This is how you can help:
I think that 5000 dollars will be enough to produce a sizeable run of scarves, and with the help of some volunteer representatives I think I can get these scarves into the marketplace where EVERYONE can have them!
All of the money raised will go into production costs.  And future profits will go back into the company to create even more beautiful scarves.  Eventually I hope to make this my full time day job while keeping my (woefully underpaid) nightjob as a musician.  Invest in Aveserico!   You will love it!
And for your contribution you will get some really cool stuff!   Like music, and art, and a scarf of your own choosing!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Shape</b>- Slightly tapered to offer a
more refined look. This is ideal when dealing with larger widths (like the Apple
Watch) to maintain better balance. </p>
<p>The hole placement for the
buckle is also chosen to obtain a secure and tight fit. This ensures that your watch
maintains all of its functionalities.</p>
<p>The width is made to allow no
sliding along the adapter. This prevents an unsightly gap as well as premature
wear.</p>
<p><b>Buckle- </b>Clessant buckles are made of stainless steel and individually inspected, the size is
non-standard to go perfectly with the Apple Watch. Finally, these are engraved
with Clessant as a mark of the utmost quality. </p>
<p><b>Adapters-</b> Are of the highest quality, made in stainless steel (316L) to fit seamlessly with your watch. Once again these are tested individually to ensure a perfect fit. We offer both polished stainless steel and black to match your watch.</p>

it is reviewed by hand thoroughly to ensure that it is of the highest standard.</p>

<p>William and Nicolas met eight

technology. William has worked for small businesses in the healthcare and technology

<p>To help them in this journey,
they have assembled a team of experienced professionals in luxury goods,
mechanical engineering, project management, entrepreneurship, and law.</p>

<p>When  the project began,
we started with a simple task, making the Apple Watch a more personalized luxury product. </p>
<p>We love the functionality of
the Apple Watch, but we want to wear a watch we are proud of displaying.</p>
<p>After numerous prototypes and
going back to the drawing board, we have finally reached what we know is the
best possible product.</p>
<p>Our packaging is also underway
and we are so far very happy with the quality of the presentation.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to start a first
production run.</p>
<p>To do this, we need your
support. With this campaign we hope to raise enough interest to cover
production and tooling costs, as well as purchase the hides. We are confident
we can bring the products to your door within a month after funding and all indicators point
to this being a credible timeframe.</p>
<p><b>It’s up to you now to pledge

<p>We are extremely serious about taking care of our
backers, early adopters, and clients. Service and trust are in the DNA of
Clessant. We have worked extremely hard at readying our product for a launch on
Indiegogo and are confident in our ability to get you the product we promise in
the timeframe we provided. However, as with all projects, there are always
imponderables. The following are what we see as risks and challenges, and more
importantly, how we are mitigating them.</p>
<p>PRODUCTION: Our production workflow is ready to go,
however, should we see a much larger demand for our product than expected, we
could see some delays. We have prepared contingency plans in case of such
events and although we could see an impact on delivery time, quality will never
be compromised and delays should be minor.</p>
<p>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENT: Our prototypes are made and we are
satisfied, however, there could potentially be small modifications to further
enhance the product. These changes will always be for the benefit of you, the
customer, and will be announced and discussed with backers.</p>

<li>Les cuirs sélectionnés pour
nos produits l’ont été pour leurs qualités. Certains cuirs peuvent avoir de
légères irrégularités ou légères marques (veines ou traces de croissance).

<p><b>Forme – </b>Légèrement fuselée

travaillons sur des bracelets assez larges, c’est la meilleure façon de
procéder afin de garantir le meilleur équilibre visuel du produit.</p>

afin que le connecteur et le bracelet soient parfaitement adaptés. Ceci garantit
l’esthétique mais aussi la durabilité du produit.</p>
<p>Le
positionnement des trous pour la boucle est choisi afin d’obtenir une fermeture
facile et sécurisée. Le positionnement garantit aussi le maintien optimal de la
montre afin d’en garder toutes les fonctionnalités.</p>
<p><b>Boucle</b> – Les boucles
Clessant sont fabriquées chez de grands fournisseurs de l’horlogerie. Elles
sont minutieusement inspectées et leurs tailles hors standard ont été
sélectionnées afin de s’accorder parfaitement avec le bracelet et la montre.
Enfin, un dernier signe de l’attention portée au produit est que chaque boucle
est gravée par laser avec notre logo.</p>
<p><b>Connecteurs-</b> De la plus
grande qualité, ils sont fabriqués en Inox 316L. Nous offrons le choix entre couleur
inox poli et couleur noire afin de s’adapter à la montre. Chaque connecteur est
testé individuellement sur une de nos montres afin de garantir un assemblage
parfait. </p>

<p>Afin de les aider dans cette aventure,
ils ont assemblé une solide équipe avec des compétences très diverses dans des

<p>Quand nous avons commencé  à travailler sur ce projet, nous sommes partis
avec une idée simple, faire de l’Apple Watch un objet de luxe encore plus
personnel. </p>
<p>Nous avons tout de suite été attirés par
les fonctionnalités et le design de l’Apple Watch mais nous voulions en faire
un objet que nos clients seraient encore plus fiers de montrer. Nous voulions
offrir une alternative.</p>
<p>Après de nombreux prototypes, nombreuses
modifications et quelques maux  de tête nous
avons finalement réussi à produire ce que nous pensons être un produit final
digne des plus grands en terme de qualité. </p>
<p>Le packaging est actuellement à l’étude
mais nous sommes déjà très satisfaits des prototypes fonctionnels. </p>
<p>Il est donc maintenant temps de
commencer notre première production.</p>
<p>Afin d’accélérer le processus et donner
vie au projet plus rapidement, nous avons besoin de votre support. Avec cette
campagne, nous espérons créer assez d’intérêt et prendre assez de précommandes
afin de couvrir des coûts d’équipements ainsi que des matériels et matériaux. Grace
au travail déjà effectué, nous sommes tout à fait confiants en notre capacité
de vous fournir les produits en moins d’un mois après la fin de la campagne.
Tous les voyants sont au vert et indiquent que cet objectif est atteignable.</p>

engagements en respectant les délais. Cependant, comme dans tous projets, il y
a toujours des impondérables. Les points suivants sont les risques potentiels identifiés
et surtout ce que nous avons prévu pour les limiter. </p>
<p>PRODUCTION: Notre chaine de production est prête, cependant, si nous
devions avoir une demande beaucoup plus forte qu’attendu, nous pourrions avoir
des délais. Nous avons prévu des options pour pallier à cela. Bien que de légers
délais puissent arriver, nous ne ferons jamais de compromis sur la qualité du
produit.</p>
<p>AMELIORATIONS PRODUITS : nos prototypes sont prêts et nous sommes très
satisfaits de la qualité. Cependant, il pourrait y avoir potentiellement des
modifications mineures afin d’améliorer encore le produit. Ces changements, s’ils
devaient avoir lieu, seront toujours faits au bénéfice de nos clients. De plus,
ils seront annoncés et discutés avec nos supporteurs.</p>
<p><b>Pour conclure, chaque contribution nous rapproche de notre objectif. Par

and with materials found on the most luxurious watches. Unlike the current
trend of retrofitting stock bracelets, these are specifically designed for the
Apple Watch. No compromises. 
A watch influences how you are
perceived by others, but most importantly, how you perceive yourself. While you embrace
the productivity and connectivity you now have with your Apple Watch, many of
you seek a more personalized experience. 
We aim to provide a wide range of high qualitaty straps for your Watch, with different leathers and colors to fit your mood
and desires. The Clessant strap is specifically designed for the Apple Watch. It makes no
compromises or shortcuts. Every detail has been chosen with the Apple Watch in
mind. 
When you receive your Clessant strap, you just need to
disconnect your current strap and slide in ours, no need for tools or special
adapters. Simple, elegant and personal. We very much hope you will enjoy these as much as we
do and will contribute to making this project a reality.In a glimpse:

Highest quality leathers (France, Italy, UK, Belgium)
Designed in France
Handmade in Western Europe & final assembly in France
Designed specifically for the Apple Watch
Stainless steel hardware




Calf - Vegetable Tanning (CK1-3): Smooth matte
finish (absorbs light, no shine) -> a natural tanning process which
shows off the natural grain of the leather. Takes on a strong patina and personality
with age.  
Calf - Chrome Tanning (CK4-6): Smooth matte finish
-> tanning process gives very deep and even colors. 



Buffalo Leather (BK1-4): Nubuck finish (soft,
velvety texture, like suede but of better quality); matte finish (absorbs
light, no shine).



Lizard Leather (LK1-5): Smooth finish (very slight
texture to the touch). Glossy finish.



Crocodile Leather (CR1, CR2, CR6): Textured finish. Small scales. Matte finish. Very saturated colors. 
Crocodile Leather (CR5): Slightly textured finish. Small scales. Glossy finish.
Alligator Belly Leather (CR3, CR4): Textured finish. Small scales. Pastel colors. -> Same pledge level as crocodile. 



Alligator Leather: Textured
finish. Large squarish scales.

Please note:


At the end of this Indiegogo campaign, pledgers will be able to fill out a survey stating their color choice, hardware choice, and size.
The leather has been selected for
its suitability and any irregularities or marks are not considered as
imperfection or fault. They may be typical characteristics such as vein and
growth marks which are natural properties of genuine leather. Each
bracelet is inspected to conform to the highest standards, eliminating any
flaws which would degrade the overall finish of the product.
Colors can slightly vary from the
pictures. Each Clessant bracelet is unique. 



Shape- Slightly tapered to offer a
more refined look. This is ideal when dealing with larger widths (like the Apple
Watch) to maintain better balance. 
The hole placement for the
buckle is also chosen to obtain a secure and tight fit. This ensures that your watch
maintains all of its functionalities.
The width is made to allow no
sliding along the adapter. This prevents an unsightly gap as well as premature
wear.
Buckle- Clessant buckles are made of stainless steel and individually inspected, the size is
non-standard to go perfectly with the Apple Watch. Finally, these are engraved
with Clessant as a mark of the utmost quality. 
Adapters- Are of the highest quality, made in stainless steel (316L) to fit seamlessly with your watch. Once again these are tested individually to ensure a perfect fit. We offer both polished stainless steel and black to match your watch.
Quality Control- Once each strap is finished,
it is reviewed by hand thoroughly to ensure that it is of the highest standard.


William and Nicolas met eight
years ago in school. Both share a passion for fashion, innovation, and
technology. William has worked for small businesses in the healthcare and technology
sectors as a business developer, while Nicolas has worked in media and finance.
To help them in this journey,
they have assembled a team of experienced professionals in luxury goods,
mechanical engineering, project management, entrepreneurship, and law.
This means that all aspects of
the project, from design to production and fulfillments are covered by
experienced and talented individuals. We know that a strong team will be key to
delivering on our promise to you as backers.


When  the project began,
we started with a simple task, making the Apple Watch a more personalized luxury product. 
We love the functionality of
the Apple Watch, but we want to wear a watch we are proud of displaying.
After numerous prototypes and
going back to the drawing board, we have finally reached what we know is the
best possible product.
Our packaging is also underway
and we are so far very happy with the quality of the presentation.
Now it’s time to start a first
production run.
To do this, we need your
support. With this campaign we hope to raise enough interest to cover
production and tooling costs, as well as purchase the hides. We are confident
we can bring the products to your door within a month after funding and all indicators point
to this being a credible timeframe.
It’s up to you now to pledge
and be amongst the very first to have a luxury strap on your Watch.
Time to show your difference!


We are extremely serious about taking care of our
backers, early adopters, and clients. Service and trust are in the DNA of
Clessant. We have worked extremely hard at readying our product for a launch on
Indiegogo and are confident in our ability to get you the product we promise in
the timeframe we provided. However, as with all projects, there are always
imponderables. The following are what we see as risks and challenges, and more
importantly, how we are mitigating them.
PRODUCTION: Our production workflow is ready to go,
however, should we see a much larger demand for our product than expected, we
could see some delays. We have prepared contingency plans in case of such
events and although we could see an impact on delivery time, quality will never
be compromised and delays should be minor.
PRODUCT ADJUSTMENT: Our prototypes are made and we are
satisfied, however, there could potentially be small modifications to further
enhance the product. These changes will always be for the benefit of you, the
customer, and will be announced and discussed with backers.
Any pledge brings us closer to our goal, we encourage
you to share this page, images, and project with as many people as you can, and
also by contributing to the project by clicking the ‘Contribute now’ at the
top of the page.
Thank you for your trust and
support in turning this project into a reality.
Most
sincerely, 
William LAURENT & Nicolas PEROT



Note: These straps are examples of colors available for this campaign.

Clessant vous propose les premiers bracelets de luxe conçus pour l'Apple Watch. Par conséquent, vous avez maintenant le choix de porter un bracelet design, original et qualitatif; démarquer vous!Nos bracelets sont conçus en respectant
les standards les plus stricts et fabriqués avec les matériaux utilisés dans la
bijouterie et l’horlogerie haut de gamme. A contre-courant de la mode qui
consiste à adapter des bracelets classiques, nos bracelets sont spécifiquement
conçus pour l’Apple Watch. Sans compromis.Une montre influence la façon dont vous êtes perçu,
mais aussi votre propre perception de vous-même. Par conséquent, le but de Clessant
est de vous fournir un produit à la hauteur de vos attentes. Nous savons que
nombre d’entre vous désirent plus que les fonctionnalités et les services
rendus par l’Apple Watch, beaucoup recherchent un produit personnalisé
reflétant leur caractère et leur envies. 
Pour répondre à ces attentes, nous
vous offrons donc une large gamme composée de bracelets de qualité avec de
nombreuses options en terme de types de cuirs (exotiques ou non) et de couleurs
afin de répondre au mieux à vos désirs et à vos humeurs. Cette gamme continuera
de grandir dans les mois et années à venir.
En plus du choix, un des éléments
essentiels offerts par les bracelets Clessant est qu’ils ont été conçus
spécifiquement pour l’Apple Watch. Aucun compromis ou raccourci n’a été pris
dans la conception. Tous les détails ont été pensés avec l’Apple Watch au centre
du projet.
Quand vous recevrez votre nouveau
bracelet, vous aurez juste à déconnecter votre ancien bracelet afin d’emboiter
le bracelet Clessant. Nul besoin de préparation, d’outils ou d’adaptateurs. 
Simplicité, élégance, personnalité.
Nous espérons que nos produits vous séduiront et que contribuerez à faire
de Clessant un succès.Nos bracelets en un clin d'oeil:
Créés spécifquement pour l'Apple Watch
A partir de cuirs de grande
qualité (sélectionnés dans les meilleures tanneries en France, Italie,
Angleterre et Belgique)
Dessinés en France

Fabriqués à la main en Europe
de l’Ouest avec assemblage final fait en France

Boucles et éléments de
connections fabriqués  en inox




Cuir de veau – Tannage végétal (cuirs de CK1 à 3): Peau très douce au
toucher avec finition mate (le cuir absorbe la lumière donc pas d’éclat) -> Le
tannage végétal est un processus naturel qui révèle la texture naturelle du
cuir. Ce type de cuir se patine avec le temps et a donc beaucoup de
personnalité.
Cuir de Veau – Chromage (cuirs de CK4 à 6) : Peau très douce au touché
avec finition mate. Le tannage au chrome permet d’avoir des couleurs très
profondes et homogènes.


Cuir de Buffle (Cuirs de BK1 à 4): Finition nubuck mate. Cuir extrêmement
doux au toucher avec une texture type velours.


Cuirs de Lézard
(Cuirs de LK1 à 5): Peau douce au toucher  mais légèrement texturée. Finition satin-mate
avec reflets.


Cuirs de crocodile (CR1, CR2, CR5, CR6): Peau texturée. Petites écailles.
Finition mate. Couleurs saturées. 
Cuirs alligator ventre (CR3, CR4): Peau texturé. Petites écailles. Couleurs
pastel. -> Même palier de contribution que pour le crocodile. 


Cuir alligator: Peaux texturées. Larges
écailles, assez carrées. 
Note:

A la fin de cette campagne de
précommandes Indiegogo, nous ferons parvenir à nos soutiens qui ont choisi un
ou des bracelets un questionnaire afin qu’ils renseignent leur choix de
couleurs pour le bracelet et le connecteur ainsi que la taille de leur montre.
Les cuirs sélectionnés pour
nos produits l’ont été pour leurs qualités. Certains cuirs peuvent avoir de
légères irrégularités ou légères marques (veines ou traces de croissance).
Ces irrégularités ou marques ne sont pas des défauts mais plutôt la preuve de
l’utilisation d’un cuir naturel. Après la fabrication, chaque
bracelet passe dans les mains d’un membre de notre équipe contrôle qualité afin
de vérifier que le bracelet est bien conforme à nos standards. Les bracelets ne
passant pas l’inspection sont détruits.

Les couleurs peuvent varier de
façon subtile par rapport aux photos. Chaque bracelet Clessant est unique!




Forme – Légèrement fuselée
afin d’offrir un bracelet plus raffiné et élégant. Etant donné que nous
travaillons sur des bracelets assez larges, c’est la meilleure façon de
procéder afin de garantir le meilleur équilibre visuel du produit.
La largeur des bracelets est choisie
afin que le connecteur et le bracelet soient parfaitement adaptés. Ceci garantit
l’esthétique mais aussi la durabilité du produit.
Le
positionnement des trous pour la boucle est choisi afin d’obtenir une fermeture
facile et sécurisée. Le positionnement garantit aussi le maintien optimal de la
montre afin d’en garder toutes les fonctionnalités.
Boucle – Les boucles
Clessant sont fabriquées chez de grands fournisseurs de l’horlogerie. Elles
sont minutieusement inspectées et leurs tailles hors standard ont été
sélectionnées afin de s’accorder parfaitement avec le bracelet et la montre.
Enfin, un dernier signe de l’attention portée au produit est que chaque boucle
est gravée par laser avec notre logo.
Connecteurs- De la plus
grande qualité, ils sont fabriqués en Inox 316L. Nous offrons le choix entre couleur
inox poli et couleur noire afin de s’adapter à la montre. Chaque connecteur est
testé individuellement sur une de nos montres afin de garantir un assemblage
parfait. 
Contrôle Qualité- Chaque bracelet est contrôlé à la main avant envoi pour garantir qu’il répond
à nos standards de qualité.



William et Nicolas se sont rencontrés il
y a 8 ans pendant leurs études. Les deux associés ont toujours partagé une
passion pour la mode, l’innovation et la technologie. William a travaillé dans
des PME et start-ups dans le domaine des sciences de la vie et des nouvelles
technologies en tant que business développeur alors que Nicolas travaillait
dans les médias et la finance. 
Afin de les aider dans cette aventure,
ils ont assemblé une solide équipe avec des compétences très diverses dans des
domaines tels que le luxe, la mécanique de précision, l’entreprenariat et le
juridique.
Par conséquent, tous les aspects de ce
projet, du design à la production, sont couverts par des individus avec une
grande expérience. Cette équipé sera une des clés de la réussite du projet.


Quand nous avons commencé  à travailler sur ce projet, nous sommes partis
avec une idée simple, faire de l’Apple Watch un objet de luxe encore plus
personnel. 
Nous avons tout de suite été attirés par
les fonctionnalités et le design de l’Apple Watch mais nous voulions en faire
un objet que nos clients seraient encore plus fiers de montrer. Nous voulions
offrir une alternative.
Après de nombreux prototypes, nombreuses
modifications et quelques maux  de tête nous
avons finalement réussi à produire ce que nous pensons être un produit final
digne des plus grands en terme de qualité. 
Le packaging est actuellement à l’étude
mais nous sommes déjà très satisfaits des prototypes fonctionnels. 
Il est donc maintenant temps de
commencer notre première production.
Afin d’accélérer le processus et donner
vie au projet plus rapidement, nous avons besoin de votre support. Avec cette
campagne, nous espérons créer assez d’intérêt et prendre assez de précommandes
afin de couvrir des coûts d’équipements ainsi que des matériels et matériaux. Grace
au travail déjà effectué, nous sommes tout à fait confiants en notre capacité
de vous fournir les produits en moins d’un mois après la fin de la campagne.
Tous les voyants sont au vert et indiquent que cet objectif est atteignable.
Par conséquent, vous n’avez plus qu’à
commander  afin d’être un des premiers à
avoir un bracelet Clessant à votre poignet.
Démarquez-vous!

Nous remercions
aussi tous nos soutiens  qui veulent
juste aider le projet. En remerciement, vous recevrez une vachette cuir
Clessant à votre domicile.


L’équipe Clessant est très concernée par le niveau de service offert à ses supporters,
early adopters et clients. Le service et la confiance sont dans l’ADN de la
marque. Nous avons ardemment travaillé avant cette campagne Indiegogo afin de créer
un produit de qualité et surtout de s’organiser pour pouvoir répondre à nos
engagements en respectant les délais. Cependant, comme dans tous projets, il y
a toujours des impondérables. Les points suivants sont les risques potentiels identifiés
et surtout ce que nous avons prévu pour les limiter. 
PRODUCTION: Notre chaine de production est prête, cependant, si nous
devions avoir une demande beaucoup plus forte qu’attendu, nous pourrions avoir
des délais. Nous avons prévu des options pour pallier à cela. Bien que de légers
délais puissent arriver, nous ne ferons jamais de compromis sur la qualité du
produit.
AMELIORATIONS PRODUITS : nos prototypes sont prêts et nous sommes très
satisfaits de la qualité. Cependant, il pourrait y avoir potentiellement des
modifications mineures afin d’améliorer encore le produit. Ces changements, s’ils
devaient avoir lieu, seront toujours faits au bénéfice de nos clients. De plus,
ils seront annoncés et discutés avec nos supporteurs.
Pour conclure, chaque contribution nous rapproche de notre objectif. Par
conséquent, nous vous encourageons donc à partager cette page, les photos de
nos bracelets et surtout de parler de ce projet au maximum de personnes autour
de vous. Les paliers de récompenses ont été conçus pour les clients potentiels
Clessant. Cependant, le premier palier est destiné à toute personne qui souhaite
seulement supporter Clessant et son équipe.
Vous pouvez donc maintenant appuyer sur « Contribuer » en haut de
cette page. 
Nous vous remercions
par avance pour votre confiance et votre aide pour transformer ce projet en
réalité. 
Avec nos sentiments
les meilleurs,

<p>Imagine a backpack not limited by gravity. One built with a weight-dispersion mechanism based on the suspension systems found in contemporary racecars, delivering a travel experience unaffected by bumps and vibrations — isolated from external irregularities to deliver a smooth and weightless trip.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>World's First Backpack with 4-Point Independent Suspension</h3>
<p>Introducing Project Zero-G: The ultimate backpack. With the world's first 4-point independent suspension - a dynamic system that maximizes comfort by minimizing weight – Zero-G offers the most comfortable and responsive wearable experience in the world.</p>
<p>As modern adventurers, we found that we needed a backpack that would both lighten our load and adapt more flexibly to our constantly changing environment. That’s why we launched Project Zero-G. After over 18 months of meticulously considering all of the existing limitations of traditional backpacks and obsessing over every <strong>functional and aesthetic</strong> detail, we finally designed the backpack of our dreams, developing original wearable technology in the process.</p>

<h3>Let our suspension take the weight, not your shoulders.</h3>
<p>Project Zero-G distinguishes itself from every other backpack on the market through both its design and its unique suspension system. Each of our backpack’s straps has both an upper and lower suspension —<strong> independent shock-absorbing points </strong>that reduce stress by distributing impact. The tops of each strap are connected with durable bellows — springy and permanently attached — while the bottoms are interchangeable, letting you fine-tune your Zero-G’s suspension to match your load and activity. From hard to soft, the included suspension sets offer 3 spring rates: heavy-duty, normal, and light.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The main goal of the Zero-G project was to create a system that <strong>protects your back </strong>by reducing the amount of pressure levied on your shoulders while you’re in motion; we were successful. Thanks to our proprietary suspension system, the effective force transferred to your shoulders while you walk, jog, or run is substantially reduced, and the faster you move, the greater the reduction in force. Students, travelers, and athletes will appreciate a<strong> 25% reduction in stress</strong> as they rush to class, through a terminal, or up a mountainside.</p>

<h2><strong>FAQ:</strong></h2>
<p><strong><i>1. Is the magnetic buckle safe?</i></strong></p>
<p>The magnetic buckle is made by Fidlock. It allows the backpack to be easily-closed, but for people to open it, it can be nearly impossible to undo the buckle unless they know the trick. We have posted a short video of how the buckle works in details in the past. Please check it out on our social media pages: </p>
<p><br/>Instagram: @keep_pursuing <br/>Snapchat: @keep_pursuing <br/>Facebook: facebook.com/Keeppursuing</p>
<p>It was our goal to not only make a sleek-looking backpack, but also guarantee the SAFETY of our backers’ personal items. For everything we do, you backers are the most important people.</p>
<p><strong><i>Is the entire backpack water-resistant or just the hood?</i></strong></p>
<p>The entire backpack is water-resistant, which means your important belongings will remain dry even in heavy rains.</p>
<p><i><strong>How durable is the backpack? Does it hold its shape? Does the material PU leather last and how do I clean it?</strong></i></p>
<p>We chose PU leather because we want to make fashionable and functional products without hurting animals. The PU leather we chose is one of highest quality materials. It is a very durable and should last for a very long time. However, the backpack's lifetime depends on your environment and how you handle the backpack. PU leather requires very little maintenance such as cleaning and wiping dirt or dust from its surface. It is not only dirt-resistant but also water-resistant. But the backpack is not machine-washable. To clean it, you simply wipe it down with a damp cloth.</p>
<p>There are also paddings in-between the exterior PU leather and the interior lining of the backpack. This means you don't have to worry about stretch marks or the backpack losing its shape.</p>
<p><i><strong>My laptops don't seem to fit in the backpacks' laptop compartments. </strong></i></p>
<p>Everyone has laptops in different sizes so it's totally understandable. But don't forget that the backpack's main compartments are very spacious, so you can always put larger laptops there instead of using the laptop pockets. </p>
<p>For example, the 15"" has a 19"" body length and can probably fit a large 17"" gaming laptop in there. And the 13"" can easily fit a 15"" laptop in its main compartment as well. Although we designed the laptop pockets for laptops specifically, you can always get creative and use them for other purposes! The same thing goes for all of our other storage compartments.</p>

Imagine a backpack not limited by gravity. One built with a weight-dispersion mechanism based on the suspension systems found in contemporary racecars, delivering a travel experience unaffected by bumps and vibrations — isolated from external irregularities to deliver a smooth and weightless trip.
 
World's First Backpack with 4-Point Independent Suspension
Introducing Project Zero-G: The ultimate backpack. With the world's first 4-point independent suspension - a dynamic system that maximizes comfort by minimizing weight – Zero-G offers the most comfortable and responsive wearable experience in the world.
As modern adventurers, we found that we needed a backpack that would both lighten our load and adapt more flexibly to our constantly changing environment. That’s why we launched Project Zero-G. After over 18 months of meticulously considering all of the existing limitations of traditional backpacks and obsessing over every functional and aesthetic detail, we finally designed the backpack of our dreams, developing original wearable technology in the process.

 

  

  
 

 

 

 
 

 
 

  
 
 
 

 

 
Patent Pending
 
Let our suspension take the weight, not your shoulders.
Project Zero-G distinguishes itself from every other backpack on the market through both its design and its unique suspension system. Each of our backpack’s straps has both an upper and lower suspension — independent shock-absorbing points that reduce stress by distributing impact. The tops of each strap are connected with durable bellows — springy and permanently attached — while the bottoms are interchangeable, letting you fine-tune your Zero-G’s suspension to match your load and activity. From hard to soft, the included suspension sets offer 3 spring rates: heavy-duty, normal, and light.
 
 
PSI = Pound per Square Inch
 
The main goal of the Zero-G project was to create a system that protects your back by reducing the amount of pressure levied on your shoulders while you’re in motion; we were successful. Thanks to our proprietary suspension system, the effective force transferred to your shoulders while you walk, jog, or run is substantially reduced, and the faster you move, the greater the reduction in force. Students, travelers, and athletes will appreciate a 25% reduction in stress as they rush to class, through a terminal, or up a mountainside.
 
 
 

 


 
Smart Storage
Innovative, elegant, and functional — with 12 individual storage compartments, an ultra-matte, scratch-proof PU leather exterior, and an interior covered in a 3D polyester matrix design — Project Zero-G is the next-generation backpack from KP’s ever-evolving line of groundbreaking products. Please watch our demo video to see details of the Zero-G's unique features and storage compartments.
 

 


 

 

 
 
 
                               
   

 

 

Modern sophisticated cars are equipped with adjustable suspension for ride comfort and performance on different road conditions.
The Zero-G system allows you to fine-tune your backpack's suspension to match the load and the activity. 

 

 

 

 

 

The new KP Utility Hook II is convenient, sleek and durable. It can be attached to the key ring of the Zero-G backpack. Perfect for your keys or pocket tools. It also has a built-in bottle opener and LED flashlight.

Idea and Beginning
The constant demand for these jeans led us to realize ""KMK jeans... the original"" and bring that unique jeans as a world novelty on the jeans market.
As the parent of a 9-year-old daughter, who was our most important inspiration, I had the vision to create creative jeans for kids which besides the fashion aspect, could also provide safety. This was my most important priority.

KMK jeans were designed to stand out from all other jeans that exist. The  patent was registered by us in 2016 at the Patent Office in Munich.

The KMK jeans style stands for boldness and timeless fashion, now more than ever!
""KMK jeans…the Original"" provide a safety function!

Help us to move forward and reach our goal.
The first steps are done. Prototypes, manufactoring, patent are registered.

we need the cut patterns for the jeans pants, for the kids pants, by MK Design Munich.

And on the other side, we have a classic grey handloom fabric in a houndstooth-inspired weave.<p> </p>

<p>We love fashion and detest waste. And when we couldn’t find women’s workwear which was beautiful, high-performance, sustainable and credible-looking, we made it. On our quest to find out what constitutes good workwear, we spoke to over a hundred women about their experience of dressing up for work. After months of thorough groundwork, we narrowed our findings to certain key aspects which mattered the most to a modern woman. With over 12 innovative features, The Reversible’s workwear design has become a modern essential every woman should own.</p>

<p>Wear it as a dress for important occasions like a meeting, an interview or a public speaking event. It is your go-to dress for all the times you want to project your credibility and influence.

 This versatile jacket dress by Redo for working women is a reversible garment which can be worn in four ways. You can wear it as a formal dress or as a jacket when you are on the move. On one side, it has a stunningly smooth plain black fabric which works perfectly for important occasions. And on the other side, we have a classic grey handloom fabric in a houndstooth-inspired weave. 
 



 
We love fashion and detest waste. And when we couldn’t find women’s workwear which was beautiful, high-performance, sustainable and credible-looking, we made it. On our quest to find out what constitutes good workwear, we spoke to over a hundred women about their experience of dressing up for work. After months of thorough groundwork, we narrowed our findings to certain key aspects which mattered the most to a modern woman. With over 12 innovative features, The Reversible’s workwear design has become a modern essential every woman should own.

Wear it as a dress for important occasions like a meeting, an interview or a public speaking event. It is your go-to dress for all the times you want to project your credibility and influence. And style it as a jacket when you are on the move. The idea is to give the redoer purchasing this garment enough creative freedom. 

 The anatomy of a Reversible jacket dress and the features which make it boardroom-worthy. We believe that customers have the right to know what their products cost to make. We keep our distribution model lean by cutting out the middlemen to ensure only a 0.5-2x markup. We reveal the true costs- then offer them to you, minus the traditional retail markup of 3-8x. The goal is to offer you the best quality products at the best possible price.  PERKSNote: Each perk that you order will contain one Reversible dress, a reusable organic cotton carry bag, a care handbook, and a styling guide. The first 10 backers won't be charged shipping. It's our way of saying thank you for being our earliest supporters.  ETHICALLY MADEThe sustainable process of making The Reversible from scrap to suit. Ethically made in India.  We believe in buying less and making things last. Our high-quality, durable dresses are built to last because of precision cutting and tailoring. We chose to produce our dress ethically at advanced local productions. The Reversible jacket dress is produced by happy crafts(wo)men at Master G factory who have different interests and support our values. This factory trains marginalized women to be pattern cutters and tailors in a male-dominated industry. Our workwear is designed, constructed and worn by women. Isn’t that amazing?  SIZINGNote: You can either opt for Custom Sizing option or select from XS-XL sizes. On selecting the Custom Sizing option, we will email you a measuring guide within 24 hours. The fabric is steamed, the sewing machines are revved up and our brains are eager to get to work on your own Reversible. It takes 4 days of cutting, tailoring and final quality check to produce an impeccably neat and super durable Reversible. And once the dress is shipped, it may take up to 3-7 days to reach your destination. Expect the garment at your doorstep in 15 days from the date of order placement. Did we say that Redo is a circular company and we want to take responsibility for the garment at the end of its lifecycle?

<p>London-based Petit Pli was founded in 2017, by trained aeronautical engineer Ryan Mario Yasin. Shortly after Ryan gifted clothes to his newborn nephew, they were already too small! This experience served as a signal: childrenswear today fails to recognise the dynamic &amp; rapidly changing bodies of Earth’s LittleHumans.</p>
<p>Inspired by aerospace engineering, Petit Pli’s continuous size adjustment is a new way of approaching garment design - one suitable to high growth rates in children. Petit Pli uses technical materials that are ultra-lightweight, reinforced, rainproof and breathable because children are extreme athletes.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, we have been hard at work testing and experimenting with a range of designs and fabrics. Petit Pli's interdisciplinary team consists of an agile force of engineers, product designers, fashion designers and sociologists. We have built an entire supply chain from the ground up, exhibited at galleries globally and won prestigious design awards. All our hard work has paid off!</p>

It is the only way to truly understand how your body changes over the course of a day. Body composition analysis breaks down your body into four components: fat, muscle mass, minerals, and body water.Simply make a loop with your hands around AURA Band, tap the device two times and then hold for five seconds. This creates a low-voltage electrical signal for an active and reactive measurement of the resistance of your tissues. Along with your age, gender, and weight information, AURA Band can then determine body composition and hydration level data.No matter what your goals are - gaining muscle and becoming stronger, staying fit, or just losing fat - with your body composition data you'll have an opportunity to track your progress with something measurable instead of something visual, like a mirror or unreliable, like scales. 
 
  

 Turn your wants into real goalsWith AURA Band you can precisely track your body changes and achieve fitness goals. For example, if you want to become stronger, you can just set a target numerical goal in AURA App, like to gain 7 pounds of muscles during a month and lose 4 pounds of fat, monitor your body composition every day and track your progress.This way is highly efficient because you definitely know what workouts are better for you and how much muscles you are gaining and how much fat you lose. Finally, you’ll achieve your goal faster.
 Gathering data to find insightsAURA Band monitors your pulse, tracks your everyday activity, and analyzes your body composition. By comparing your data with other users’ (all anonymous, of course), AURA Band finds insights and anomalies that could help identify risks or potential early stages of a disease.For example, you have a healthy weight but your body fat percentage may be higher than normal and it leads to developing cardiometabolic conditions. This is why monitoring your body composition and heart rate activity helps to prevent potential risks or complications in this area.
 Control hydration levelOur bodies are about 70% water. So it makes sense that one of the most important things related to your health is hydration. Water gives us mineral elements and even more important, electrolytes.With AURA Band, you can monitor hydration levels every day or every hour (or even more frequently if you want). You can get dehydrated and not even know, as our body does not necessarily signal us about it. AURA Band tells you when to drink a glass of water based on your activity data and your body hydration levels.
 Rest easierSleep is an important part of our life, it affects our health and mood during the day. A good night's sleep can help you be more productive and concentrated, overcome depression and extra weight gain.Gathering your movements and heart rate during sleeping helps AURA Band to know the duration and sleep stages (deep, light and REM*). This data allows us to suggest when you should go to sleep with the smart alarm waking you up more peacefully.
 Everything’s better with friendsAURA Band is community-driven. Compete with your Facebook friends through Duels, where you can challenge AURA Band users in daily or week-long activity battles. This helps motivate you to be active by adding a little bit of healthy competition into your fitness routine.
 

AURA band rewards for your activity with Coins, which you can exchange for discounts and gifts from our partners. We’ve partnered with insurance companies, sports brands, and fitness centers all over the world. Earn AURA Coins for every step, workout or positive progress on your body composition. A special multiplier goes into effect for hitting specific targets, such as taking over 15K steps in a day. All the rewards have a fitness and health focus, so this is our way to push users’ limits and get a new pair of sneakers as a reward.

We gave AURA Bands to people for 7 days and asked them to tell us what they think about it, their favorite features and issues. Check their opinion below. 
 
 
 Download Our media kitOne app for all your dataThe AURA Band carefully collects all your data and sends via Bluetooth (BLE 4.2+) to AURA App where you can easily keep an eye on your progress, look for your personal health tips and set new goals to achieve. What’s more, besides integration with Apple HealthKit and GoogleFit we’re planning to add three other fitness apps: Strava, MyFitnessPal, and Runtastic. Thus, you'll get more instruments to analyze and share your data and progress. 
 All your data safe and under controlAll your personal information is saved and encrypted in your personal account. Every user’s profile and health sensitive data is protected and under control. AURA Band doesn’t send or exchange your data without permission. Nevertheless, we get a lot of attention to anonymize it and use only for scientific researches.
 See your data and notifications in colorTo help visualize your data easily, the AURA app uses a color code. For example, if your hydration level is in the red, that means you’re dehydrated and need to drink more water. If it’s blue, then your hydration level is within normal range. When it’s green, that means your hydration level is perfect for your specific height, weight, and age.
 All notifications on your handAURA Band supports all your smartphone notifications and tells you if someone is calling or texting you a message. The LEDs will blink in a certain color to notify you. If you are using headphones, you can answer your phone call by knocking your AURA Band or send the preset message as an answer.
 
 Make your AURA Band your own by swapping out the wrist straps for different colors: Red, White, Green, Black, and Yellow. We'll ask you about what case and strap color you want after the end of the campaign. In the box, you could find two sizes of straps in circumference (130mm and 210mm) to make AURA Band a fit for every wrist.AURA Band comes with charging dock USB Type-C cable and Type-B adapter. 

 Full Tech Specs 

 Activity tracking techAURA Band tracks your activity with the help of 9-axis motion sensor, including accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. These sensors precisely track your activity as well as what type of activity it is. The data from the motion sensors runs through our algorithms to determine if you were running, cycling, or even lifting weights. The motion sensor is also used for gesture control, i.e. to start bioimpedance analysis, the user can knock his or her device twice.
 Pulse monitoring techAURA Band has an optical pulse sensor, which sends an IR and Red light through your hand that comes back to the light-sensitive element. The sensor is always in contact with your wrist while you’re wearing your AURA band, tracking your heartbeat through the change in your blood vessel volume as the light from the sensor changes its parameters.The smart algorithm understands when to measure your pulse in real time and when it could be less frequent to save the device’s battery. For example, when you’re sleeping, AURA Band measures your pulse every 15 minutes, but while you’re jogging, it measures constantly. You can also enable the real-time pulse measurement on demand any time you want.
 Bioimpedance analysis in comparison with medical grade deviceThis video shows you how AURA Band’s bioimpedance analysis works in comparison with 8-point medical grade setup. 
 
 
 
 AURA Devices was founded in 2016 with the goal of helping people live longer. A lot of people we knew had suffered from heart attacks or sleep apnea. AURA Band helps prevent the onset of such diseases by motivating you to keep track of your health.Our ultimate goal is to create a platform that collects personal health through a series of devices. The first stage is wearables: bracelets, watches, sports cuffs. After that, we plan to develop pills or capsules that can analyze various parameters from within, transferring the data to external devices.
 At the moment we’ve made a bunch of preparations for mass production: already made 200 of AURA Bands for tests (with the same contract manufacturers who will do mass prod.), ordered mold forms for silicone and plastic parts and started negotiations for certifications with independent labs.
 Hardware Studio Connection is a program run by the experts at Dragon Innovation and Avnet. 
AURA Devices was founded in 2016 by three enthusiast, trying to bring true innovation into wearables field. Now, we are a team of 16 highly-qualified professionals with a dream to make people healthier and happier with the help of a good looking device - AURA Band. We've had a nice journey up to our current point and want you to become a part of our history!

If the user hunches over more frequently, the tolerance between each reminder will become shorter and the user gets reminders more frequently.There are two built-in programs available to select to accommodate different needs:1) Strict Mode with 3 seconds of tolerance, where the device vibrates 3 seconds after it detects the hunched posture.2) Loose Mode with 15 seconds of tolerance, where the device vibrates 15 seconds after it detects the hunched posture. Double-press the button to switch between programs.  As a “standalone” assistant, UPOSTURE can be used anytime and anywhere no matter you work, play, walk or study.UPOSTURE is charged using a magnetic charging cable that’s easy to snap onto the back and comes with a decent-sized battery which with a full charge can last for up to 14 days.When placing the device in a flat position, an LED indicator will show how much battery power remains. It turns green when the remaining power is greater than 20% and red when it’s less than 20%.",37.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>Our goal is to manufacture as much as possible ourselves, in our  small manufacture in Pforzheim, but there are components that we need to  purchase from other vendors, such as dials, hands, sapphire crystals and the automatic  movements.</p>
<p>As such, we depend on the timely delivery of some components to  deliver products to our buyers, and the availability of some parts  fluctuates. However, our manufacture has been in business since over 35  years, and we always delivered our products to our customer within  reasonable amounts of time. Both our Swiss,  German and Far East partners are  experienced in watch manufacturing, leading to a high safety level for  our supporters. Each mechanical movement is first tested by our sourcing partner for a duration of 2 weeks, and once we assembled them into our watches, we test the watches again thoroughly for 7 days. </p>
<p>At this stage we have completed design, engineering testing and  calibration, and have overcome all technical obstacles. We produced  tooling for our cases, dials, straps and hands in the summer of 2019 and  to be ahead of time, we are currently producing 100 units of each  style. All we need at this time is to raise funds to start mass production.  Assembled watches are subject to water resistance and air pressure  resistance testing, impact resistance, corrosion and abrasion testing,  and final accuracy testing.</p>
<p>Shall there be any defect with our product, we will take it back to inspect, repair or replace, depending on the severity of the issue.  In case of doubt, we invite you to review the comments left by our backers on the previous campaigns as well.  </p>
