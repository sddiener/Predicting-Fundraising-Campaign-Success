<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My sisterger calls me a ""Jersey dirty softy who likes to cry to his own music and has a rough sense of humor"". It's pretty accurate to be honest.</p>
<p>If you must know, I'm the love child of James Bay, Gregory Alan Isakov, John Mayer, Derek Trucks + maybe some more. At least I would really like to be.</p>
<p>Join me in this wild ride of recording my first ever debut album with grammy-nominated music veterans Maggie Rose and Bobby Holland at Starstruck Entertainment. Holy moly, can't believe I just wrote that out. It's a dream. If you google them, you're gonna be like ""wait what? HOLY MOLY IS RIGHT!""</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm currently an independent artist so don't have a record label to fund this, and I spend all my time in my basement writing all these songs, so we need some help with that ""m"" word (money, I'm talkin bout money). So I'm here on Indiegogo asking you all to help with funding - aka be my record label! Let's make an album! please, help me pay for gas and food because this is my dream and it's finally actually coming true and I need your help. I love you thank you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where the money goes (hint: NOT beer)</h3>
<p>Take a look on over to the right and you'll see a bunch o' boxes describing what you can get in exchange for sharing some dollar bills with us. I tried to make it fun, cause I'm a fun guy. Money will be going towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>paying my producer, sound engineer, mixer, + amazing musicians who are going to do session work with me in the studio. Genius' don't come cheap y'all.</li>
<li>paying the studio for letting me sing in there.</li>
<li>paying for marketing so the album doesn't flop.</li>
<li>paying for travel and food so I can get to Nashville and hopefully not be too hungry while I'm in Nashville.</li>
<li>paying for a few music videos so people can stare at my face on a screen and hopefully sing along to songs they hopefully like.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Indiegogo suggests that I let you know the impact funding this campaign is going to have. Well one, you're gonna make me feel like the luckiest guy in the world. I can't believe people believe in me enough to keep asking me for music. It's truly a gift. But also, I really just want people to FEEL. I want them to sit down, close their eyes and understand the world and themselves in a new way when they're done listening to this album. I want it to create some peace for a lot of people. If you can help me make that happen, that would be pretty freakin rad. It would also make my mom really happy she says.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Honestly, just spam the crap out of people. Please share this far and wide. I promise you the music wont suck! I really hope it wont! If it does you can make me into a funny internet meme! Either way it'll be worth it!</p>
<p>Go ahead, don't be scared. Send this campaign to your mom and grandkids saying ""delilah have you seen this kid dillan hardigan you should try and send him some mail and go on a date"" and then Delilah will say ""we're already dating grandma"" and we'll all live happily ever after crying at Thanksgiving dinner while listening to my new album that you helped fund.</p>
<p>Cool, cool, I think that's everything - hope I did this right.</p>
<p>love you,</p>

<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<p>My name is Jeremy Joyce and I am a songwriter, guitarist, and full time working musician in New Orleans. I have been playing music for 25 years and writing songs for about 13. I've lived in Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Saint Louis and performed in each of these cities. I've also toured the country several times, sometimes as a solo musician, sometimes as a lead guitarist.</p>
<p>Every place I've lived and each place I've visited has influenced me musically. I'd played Punk, Metal, Country, Americana, and Rock. Out of all the places that I've lived it's New Orleans that has had the most profound impact musically, and it is here that I transitioned to a full time working musician.</p>
<p>At 16, in high school, I bought my first guitar with money I made working the late shift at a gas station. I didn't know what the notes were but I taught myself to play. Years later in New Orleans I would study the music of the city, learning Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Funk.</p>
<p>I had written a lot of songs before arriving in New Orleans, but something happened once I began to learn the city's music. The styles that I was studying became a part of my music.</p>
<p>Performing live I used the opportunity to try out the music I was writing. I found that I could play the songs I was writing for complete strangers and that they enjoyed them. If I played a song and no one seemed to like it, then I went back to the drawing board and re-examined that song.</p>
<p>It's a unique experience to try out a new song on an audience of strangers. For example one song ""Come Back To New Orleans (to celebrate the Mardi Gras)"" became a closing song for every gig that I played at BB King's during my residency there.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>I am confident the in the quality of the songs because I been testing them night after night.</strong></i></p>

</div>
<div>We will record a lot of songs that I play with my rock band, but it's totally possible that as we are going through material, some of my jazz tunes may make an appearance. No matter what we end up doing this is going to be an entirely New Orleans album.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Why Contribute?</h3>
<p>By contributing to my campaign funders will help me move my career forward and also contribute to the overall musical culture of New Orleans. With a new album I can work harder on marketing myself and book more work. I will be looking for bigger and better opportunities. Having an album that reflects the sound I have been creating is key for that. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></h2>
<p>Here's the nitty gritty!</p>
<h3>Our Costs</h3>
<p>I am setting a fairly low budget of $5,000. The breakdown is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording Costs - $3,000</li>
<li>CD Manufacturing Costs- $1,000</li>
<li>Promotion - $1,000</li>
</ul>
<p>If we make above the goal, additional money will be put toward promotion.</p>
<p>I believe that we can make an excellent recording in a shorter time on a lower budget because we will be using great musicians, many of whom already know the material. Mike and I also have a successful track record of working together at his studio.</p>
<p>The main promotion focus will be digital in order to keep promotions costs low.</p>
<h3>What I Deliver</h3>
<p>Not only will we be producing Physical CDs, but there are tons of great other perks you can get such as Posters, Shirts, Stickers, Lyric Sheets, Custom Songs, and a House Concert!</p>
<h3>Budget Concerns</h3>
<p>If we don't make the full amount the following items are at risk <strong>Promotion</strong>, <strong>Physical CDs</strong>, and <strong>Recording Quality</strong>. As this if my first crowdfunded recording project I am taking a risk. No matter the amount we raise I will still make the record but may have to find creative ways to fund the key components. The release could also be delayed.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2><u>The Impact</u></h2>
<p>The main impact of this project is to release great songs into the world. And by doing so I will also be moving my career forward. I currently work fulltime as a performing musician but don't have a physical album that represents my current sound. With this album I will be able to share the music with new fans and increase my income and share the music</p>
<h3>Radio Success</h3>
<p>Many of my songs have been played on American and International radio. ""I'm Easy"" regularly receives Satellite AirPlay. ""Why Don't We Get Together on Christmas Eve"" was played by all the New Orleans local radio stations. Recently ""The Weight of the World"" was played in Cape Town, South Africa. This kind of success tells me that the songs are strong. I believe that this new batch of songs will have similar radio success.</p>
<h3>If You're in New Orleans</h3>
<p>If you're in New Orleans, come out and see me play! I play regularly at clubs on Frenchmen Street with my band including at The Apple Barrel, Bamboula's, and 30x90.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h2>
<p>The biggest risk to the success of this project is funding, but I am personally committed to ensuring this project's success. As a self-starter and and independent musician I encounter challenges every day. It is my job to come up with the solutions. If we don't reach our funding goal it's possible the project could be delayed, but it will not be cancelled under any circumstances.</p>
</div><div>

Out of all the places that I've lived it's New Orleans that has had the most profound impact musically, and it is here that I transitioned to a full time working musician.
At 16, in high school, I bought my first guitar with money I made working the late shift at a gas station. I didn't know what the notes were but I taught myself to play. Years later in New Orleans I would study the music of the city, learning Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Funk.
I had written a lot of songs before arriving in New Orleans, but something happened once I began to learn the city's music. The styles that I was studying became a part of my music.
Performing live I used the opportunity to try out the music I was writing. I found that I could play the songs I was writing for complete strangers and that they enjoyed them. If I played a song and no one seemed to like it, then I went back to the drawing board and re-examined that song.
It's a unique experience to try out a new song on an audience of strangers. For example one song ""Come Back To New Orleans (to celebrate the Mardi Gras)"" became a closing song for every gig that I played at BB King's during my residency there.
I am confident the in the quality of the songs because I been testing them night after night.

The Project

<h3>Qui est Petite Celine?</h3>
<p>Petite Celine is a Franco-American indie singer-songwriter &amp; multi-instrumentalist based out of Brooklyn, NY. Born to a French Air Force colonel and an American lawyer-gone-psychic-detective, Celine rebelled into the arts, excelling first in acting for film &amp; TV, working with directors such as Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood by the age of 10, and picking up a handful of instruments along the way.</p>
<p>As a native New Yorker growing up between two countries, a very petite Celine noticed some pretty big differences in the music that got airplay internationally. French radio aired a diverse selection of music, featuring a wide variety of languages and cultures - exciting Celine, a multi-linguist herself - while US radio cemented her love for American Pop.</p>
<p>But it wasn't until college, when Celine found herself homeless with only a small suitcase and the guitar on her back, that she started performing her own compositions for complete strangers. Busking on the streets of Lower Manhattan, she discovered the power music has to bring people together from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Today, Petite Celine plays regularly across the Tristate area, where her LED paintings have also become accompaniment to the act. Her mission, a Petite World, is to celebrate cultures from around the globe and build bridges not borders. Petite Celine’s sound is fueled by fusion and uplifted by her love for Pop. This can be heard on her debut Folk album, Young Soldier, as well as in a wide variety of collaborations with American &amp; French songwriters / producers. But most notably on the upcoming World Pop album, Man Made Fire, scheduled to release March 15th, 2019, which incorporates several languages and musical influences. </p>

<h3><strong>What You're Contributing:</strong></h3>
<p>Man Made Fire is a project that I have been passionately working on for a little over 2 years, and I'm so excited for it to finally be out there in the wild! Though it may have taken me a little more time than I would've liked, I was able to coordinate and fund the entire production of the album myself. But now? I'm out of personal funds. And the problem is, the album came out so good that I think it deserves some attention and a decent shot! But that costs more money. So that's where you come in!</p>
<p><strong>With your contributions I hope to achieve these things</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the CDs, showcasing the beautiful album photography by Dutch Doscher, and designed by Emily Claire Smith.<ul><li>$770.97 for 300 eco-friendly CDs </li></ul>
</li>
<li>Shipping and handling costs to ship the CDs to radios, journalists, bloggers, networks, festivals, etc...<ul><li>$775.00 to send 100 CDs</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Merchandise, designed by the fabulous Emily Clare Smith, to sell stuff on tour and get people hyped! Also so I can thank you guys somehow!!<ul>
<li>$57.92 for 1,000 stickers</li>
<li>$103.00 for 400 guitar picks</li>
<li>$108.00 for 500 temporary tattoos of the Petite World ""flag,"" designed by Mitus Andronica. (500 is the minimum lol but the design was actually made by a tattoo artist!)</li>
<li>$72.14 for 500 Album Release Flyers, to display at coffee shops and hand out when I'll be at SXSW in March for the release.</li>
<li>$364.01 for 48 knit beanies with the Petite World flag</li>
<li>$243.40 for 15 canvas prints</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PR campaign with <u><a href=""https://www.rockpaperscissors.biz/worldmusicpr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rock Paper Scissors</a></u>, including submitting to festivals, getting the CD to radio stations (&amp; actually having them listen), booking gigs &amp; appearances, and outreaching to press, among other services.<ul><li>$4,000.00 flat for the entire 3 month campaign.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What You're Receiving:</h3>
<p>When you contribute, you get access some exclusive perks, and of course my undying gratitude. Depending on which perk you choose, you could get anything from a signed CD and guitar picks, to a Petite World beanie, <u><strong><a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/55430485073"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tickets to the album release party</a></strong></u>, or an original painting!</p>
<p>Indeed, I'm also a painter (mostly impressionist &amp; abstract) and I'm offering a lot of original works as perks (at a discounted price)! Many of them are part of my Electric Lynx collection (or my ""Adult Night Light"" collection, as I like to call it), which showed for Frieze Week at Superfine! Art Fair last year in NYC. It's a series of Acrylic &amp; LED paintings that play with the transition from day to night. The idea was inspired by music actually, an art form which can only exist within the linear perception of time. But paintings tend to express a captured moment in time. By using several techniques and some light-boxing, I was able to create paintings that change with the passing of time. Feel free to check them out <u><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmGiLslYu_tmWZQM05AlkUUZtLogVIjMY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube</a></u> or on my <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/GypsyLynx"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Etsy</u></a> page for a better look.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>This is an important time for nuanced material created by women, and this project definitely reflects that, as it illustrates the triumphs and struggles of the independent woman. This is a dear album to me that represents a lot, not just personally but idealistically. A sort of One Love project, if you will. My favorite thing to witness is two people who couldn't appear to be any more different, singing or dancing along to the same exact song. I've seen it happen many times before. This album is tailored to that experience.</p>
<p>Musically the album is a manifestation of the fusion of several genres. From New York to Paris, folk to jazz, celtic to latin, with 5 languages and soulful backbone, the intention of my music is to embody reverence for those who have influenced me, reverence for diversity and the cultural context in which music genres have developed.</p>
<p>After taking a lengthy hiatus to record the album, I've actually only been back to playing shows with my new (and incredible) touring band for a year. Despite that, we're already making waves in the Greater New York City Area, especially with the material from this album. We play local venues regularly (1-3 shows a month) and already have residencies, we've been on the air several times, and are planning an east-coast tour. Plus releasing the album at SXSW this March! Obtaining the much-needed financial backing for the remaining costs will make all the difference in opening new opportunities, reaching new audiences, branching out, and playing new venues. And most importantly, giving this album a shot in the world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>It's pretty well known that choosing the indie musician path is tough, and living in New York City presents its own unique challenges. So your support, even the tiniest donation, really does go a long way to saving an arm and a leg.</p>
<p>Despite the risks, I love writing and playing music and am dedicated to using every dollar you contribute toward making music for our Petite World community. And no matter what happens, the CD will be released!</p>
</div><div><div>
<h3>Short on Cash? No Problem.</h3>
<p>I totally understand that not everyone can contribute in a financial way. Maybe you're an artist in the same boat! Not to worry! You can still contribute a whole bunch to this campaign! Because everything is such a numbers game these days, one way you can really lend a hand is to follow, like, and SHARE! If you use Spotify, put Petite Celine in a playlist and share with friends!</p>

Qui est Petite Celine?
Petite Celine is a Franco-American indie singer-songwriter & multi-instrumentalist based out of Brooklyn, NY. Born to a French Air Force colonel and an American lawyer-gone-psychic-detective, Celine rebelled into the arts, excelling first in acting for film & TV, working with directors such as Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood by the age of 10, and picking up a handful of instruments along the way.
As a native New Yorker growing up between two countries, a very petite Celine noticed some pretty big differences in the music that got airplay internationally. French radio aired a diverse selection of music, featuring a wide variety of languages and cultures - exciting Celine, a multi-linguist herself - while US radio cemented her love for American Pop.
But it wasn't until college, when Celine found herself homeless with only a small suitcase and the guitar on her back, that she started performing her own compositions for complete strangers. Busking on the streets of Lower Manhattan, she discovered the power music has to bring people together from all walks of life.
Today, Petite Celine plays regularly across the Tristate area, where her LED paintings have also become accompaniment to the act. Her mission, a Petite World, is to celebrate cultures from around the globe and build bridges not borders. Petite Celine’s sound is fueled by fusion and uplifted by her love for Pop. This can be heard on her debut Folk album, Young Soldier, as well as in a wide variety of collaborations with American & French songwriters / producers. But most notably on the upcoming World Pop album, Man Made Fire, scheduled to release March 15th, 2019, which incorporates several languages and musical influences.

What You're Contributing:
Man Made Fire is a project that I have been passionately working on for a little over 2 years, and I'm so excited for it to finally be out there in the wild! Though it may have taken me a little more time than I would've liked, I was able to coordinate and fund the entire production of the album myself. But now? I'm out of personal funds. And the problem is, the album came out so good that I think it deserves some attention and a decent shot! But that costs more money. So that's where you come in!
With your contributions I hope to achieve these things:

Pressing the CDs, showcasing the beautiful album photography by Dutch Doscher, and designed by Emily Claire Smith.$770.97 for 300 eco-friendly CDs 

Shipping and handling costs to ship the CDs to radios, journalists, bloggers, networks, festivals, etc...$775.00 to send 100 CDs

Merchandise, designed by the fabulous Emily Clare Smith, to sell stuff on tour and get people hyped! Also so I can thank you guys somehow!!
$57.92 for 1,000 stickers
$103.00 for 400 guitar picks
$108.00 for 500 temporary tattoos of the Petite World ""flag,"" designed by Mitus Andronica. (500 is the minimum lol but the design was actually made by a tattoo artist!)
$72.14 for 500 Album Release Flyers, to display at coffee shops and hand out when I'll be at SXSW in March for the release.
$364.01 for 48 knit beanies with the Petite World flag
$243.40 for 15 canvas prints


PR campaign with Rock Paper Scissors, including submitting to festivals, getting the CD to radio stations (& actually having them listen), booking gigs & appearances, and outreaching to press, among other services.$4,000.00 flat for the entire 3 month campaign.



What You're Receiving:
When you contribute, you get access some exclusive perks, and of course my undying gratitude. Depending on which perk you choose, you could get anything from a signed CD and guitar picks, to a Petite World beanie, tickets to the album release party, or an original painting!
Indeed, I'm also a painter (mostly impressionist & abstract) and I'm offering a lot of original works as perks (at a discounted price)! Many of them are part of my Electric Lynx collection (or my ""Adult Night Light"" collection, as I like to call it), which showed for Frieze Week at Superfine! Art Fair last year in NYC. It's a series of Acrylic & LED paintings that play with the transition from day to night. The idea was inspired by music actually, an art form which can only exist within the linear perception of time. But paintings tend to express a captured moment in time. By using several techniques and some light-boxing, I was able to create paintings that change with the passing of time. Feel free to check them out YouTube or on my Etsy page for a better look.

The Impact:
This is an important time for nuanced material created by women, and this project definitely reflects that, as it illustrates the triumphs and struggles of the independent woman. This is a dear album to me that represents a lot, not just personally but idealistically. A sort of One Love project, if you will. My favorite thing to witness is two people who couldn't appear to be any more different, singing or dancing along to the same exact song. I've seen it happen many times before. This album is tailored to that experience.
Musically the album is a manifestation of the fusion of several genres. From New York to Paris, folk to jazz, celtic to latin, with 5 languages and soulful backbone, the intention of my music is to embody reverence for those who have influenced me, reverence for diversity and the cultural context in which music genres have developed.
After taking a lengthy hiatus to record the album, I've actually only been back to playing shows with my new (and incredible) touring band for a year. Despite that, we're already making waves in the Greater New York City Area, especially with the material from this album. We play local venues regularly (1-3 shows a month) and already have residencies, we've been on the air several times, and are planning an east-coast tour. Plus releasing the album at SXSW this March! Obtaining the much-needed financial backing for the remaining costs will make all the difference in opening new opportunities, reaching new audiences, branching out, and playing new venues. And most importantly, giving this album a shot in the world. 

Risks & Challenges:
It's pretty well known that choosing the indie musician path is tough, and living in New York City presents its own unique challenges. So your support, even the tiniest donation, really does go a long way to saving an arm and a leg.
Despite the risks, I love writing and playing music and am dedicated to using every dollar you contribute toward making music for our Petite World community. And no matter what happens, the CD will be released!

Short on Cash? No Problem.
I totally understand that not everyone can contribute in a financial way. Maybe you're an artist in the same boat! Not to worry! You can still contribute a whole bunch to this campaign! Because everything is such a numbers game these days, one way you can really lend a hand is to follow, like, and SHARE! If you use Spotify, put Petite Celine in a playlist and share with friends!

<h3>I'm Kimberly. </h3>
<p>When I was very little I used to go up in front of crowds and tell everyone ""Ladies and Gentlemen! Give me your attention please!!"" And then I would sing! Usually it was Stevie Wonder... but singing has always been a dream. I would write songs, song after song would come to me, in the private seclusion of my home and only sometimes, would I ever share my recordings.</p>
<p>For years I have helped many other artists to promote their music and watched excitedly as they made beautiful music on my show! You may already know of me from my interview show called The Red Booth. I created that show from scratch and it's now broadcasting in 417 cities across the US. I created an interview show to help support artists. I love what I do. But I have always had a passion for music and singing myself. I have written some 100 songs, melodies, hooks and chorus most of which have sat collecting dust. I've gotten more and more brave about sharing. I put out one little song a few years ago. And then waited and wondered how to create the true vision I have for my style of music, while I worried over my own insecurities and fears of performing. Last year I made a big breakthrough with myself and decided to really find the right way to do this for me. </p>
<p>Now I have an amazing opportunity. I have Chris Leon, a Multi Platinum, OSCAR winning music producer who has just been nominated for a Grammy, for his work producing the soundtrack for The Greatest Showman, producing my first EP! </p>
<p>He loves my music style, he loves my lyrics and melody and he is coming to LA to record my vocals. He's doing the composing and will also record all the instruments. It's going to be big band, piano and so much more! </p>
<p>This is truly a dream come true and I can't wait to share my music with you. This is a very personal passion of mine and I am going to come out with this beautiful EP that will truly represent the style of music I have always dreamed of and imagined I would release. </p>
<p>And with such a fantastic talent in the music industry behind me I know that it will succeed. I also have a consultant that has proven stats getting songs on the top of streaming services and I am going to release this EP with a bang, get it into the press and then.... DUN DUN DUN actually sing these songs, on my TV SHOW where so many other's have performed. </p>
<p>I need to raise the money to produce this, from composing to, recording all of the instruments and vocals, the mixing and mastering and all of it, is in total 9K. Usually this is what a record label would cover, but I am doing this directly with Chris Leon. Plus the cost of CDs and final music products to ship out. </p>
<p>If you will help me to create this lifelong dream come true, I will send you not only the EP when it comes out, but a personal signed letter and message thanking you. Check out all the perks for this campaign! For those who help with larger amounts I would give you special thanks on my EP and a special invitation to be on set while I perform the songs in studio. </p>
<p>But mainly what you will be doing is helping a very determined artist, who has made it her career to help other artists, finally also get to share hers with the world. My music is very old school sounding. I have watched as the songs I wrote sometimes 10 years ago had similar new artists coming out with similiar themes and ideas, Postmodern Jukebox, Lana Del Ray, Elle King, all have met with wild success. And Chris Leon also believes that what he's got from me has the same potential. I have shown them to a few people in music and have had overwhelmingly good feedback. </p>
</div><div> </div><div>If you know me, you've been following the creation of my TV show from my garage onto national TV and you know how determined I am when I decide to do something. I am determined to get this beautiful new EP done and ready to deliver. </div><div> </div><div>Chris is coming out to record my vocals the week before the Grammys. Those of you who help me with this very important part of the process will also get special updates on the journey, behind the scenes videos and stories and personal updates from me and Chris. </div><div> </div><div>All of the money raised will go straight to the production of this EP and the creation of the materials to send out when the EP is finished. I will be eternally grateful to those who believed in me despite my closeted love of singing and life long stage freight. I am finally going to have the support to believe in the music I love writing, so much. </div><div> </div><div><p>If you can't donate to this right now then please help me by sharing this and helping me to spread the word! Every little bit counts! Thank you so much for reading this and I love you my friends! Here's to art lifting the world from darkness. &lt;3 </p></div></div>","I'm Kimberly.

<h3>Fightin' The Wars</h3>
<p>Think about that phrase for a moment. At one point in your life, you have probably felt as if your life was in turmoil, you were all alone, or that the experiences in your life were piling up so much that you just couldn't take much more.</p>
<p>For me, during those times, music has always been the answer. For this reason, I am deeply honored and incredibly excited to share what were once just words on a page and will now be brought to life as songs on this album as my gift to YOU.</p>
<p>My name is Michael Dart and I'm a singer, songwriter and  bandleader that began and spent the first half of my music career in CA singing and playing in some of the last remaining authentic country venues along with many true country players and legends.  Fast forward to my current home here in Texas where I have done much of the same for the past  11 years and was recently honored with a 2014 Academy of Western Artists Award for Pure Country Group of The Year as well as a 2015 Ameripolitan nomination for Honky Tonk Male.</p>
<p>I am so thrilled to bring you into my journey of recording and releasing my new album, Fightin' The Wars from start to finish and beyond.  The songs I've picked for this project are a collection of songs I have written or co-written with the exception of three. One of those three, I will be singing as a duet with my daughter Isabella (her FIRST time recording).  The other two were written by two of my mentors Al Bruno and Archie Francis.</p>
<p>You need to know that most of these songs have been <i>rigorously tested on barroom stages, dancehalls, listening rooms, coffeehouses, as well as the great outdoors.  </i>They have passed the crowd approval test through invoking <strong>TEARS</strong> and <strong>GOOSEBUMPS </strong>from listening and <strong>SWEAT</strong> and<strong> LOVE</strong> from dancing. Some, however, have only seen the light of day from the inside of my songbag.</p>
<p>It's <strong>TIME</strong>, time to explore our vulnerabilities together and with your contribution/involvement, we can reap the benefits from the harvest of this album!</p>
<h3>Plant the songs, harvest the album</h3>
</div><div><p>This will TRULY be a DIY endeavor, from beginning to end.  I'm asking for $12,000 to cover costs of the studio/engineer time for recording, mixing, mastering, musician time, guest musicians, cd replication, digital platform fees, taxes and album promotion not only in the Austin/Central Texas community but nationally and globally as well.  WHEN we reach our goal, we will utilize any extra funds (known as a stretch) to cover a small batch of vinyl copies of the record. </p></div><div>
<h3>How can YOU help?</h3>
<p>Back in the day, unknown artists put their utmost hopes in a record executive attending one of their shows so that they might be ""discovered"".  In my mind, that person was a portly gentleman smoking a huge cigar and puffs of smoke surrounding his head, pushing a contract across the table, ""Here Son, Sign on the dotted line.."".  Well some might say those days are gone and so far, that day has never come for me.  But guess what, it is never too late and I still hold tight to my dreams.  Reaching people and hopefully soothing them with my songs is my purpose and You are the reason I feel the need to get these songs out there during what is a chaotic time for humanity.  YOU are the reason I write and share my soul.  That is why YOU are that person in the back of the room.  YOU are my record executive.  I need YOU to help me sign on the dotted line.  I need YOUR help, YOUR contribution will go directly to the making of this album.</p>
<p><b>What do I do? </b>Click on the <strong><i>pink button</i> BACK IT </strong>at the top of the page. You will then be guided through the payment process. You can contribute any amount you wish. You may contribute without receiving a perk.  You may also contribute and receive a perk by picking out one that you would like from the section located on the right side of the page.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>This is a flexible campaign, meaning that even if the goal of $12,000 is not met, all funds contributed will still be managed appropriately toward the making of this album.</p>
<p>Any perks that require band performance will be scheduled around existing band commitments.</p>
<p>Other perks will be fulfilled within the time period. You will be notified about any date or shipping changes if they arise.</p>

Back in the day, unknown artists put their utmost hopes in a record executive attending one of their shows so that they might be ""discovered"".  In my mind, that person was a portly gentleman smoking a huge cigar and puffs of smoke surrounding his head, pushing a contract across the table, ""Here Son, Sign on the dotted line.."".  Well some might say those days are gone and so far, that day has never come for me.  But guess what, it is never too late and I still hold tight to my dreams.  Reaching people and hopefully soothing them with my songs is my purpose and You are the reason I feel the need to get these songs out there during what is a chaotic time for humanity.  YOU are the reason I write and share my soul.  That is why YOU are that person in the back of the room.  YOU are my record executive.  I need YOU to help me sign on the dotted line.  I need YOUR help, YOUR contribution will go directly to the making of this album.
What do I do? Click on the pink button BACK IT at the top of the page. You will then be guided through the payment process. You can contribute any amount you wish. You may contribute without receiving a perk.  You may also contribute and receive a perk by picking out one that you would like from the section located on the right side of the page.
 
Risks & Challenges
This is a flexible campaign, meaning that even if the goal of $12,000 is not met, all funds contributed will still be managed appropriately toward the making of this album.
Any perks that require band performance will be scheduled around existing band commitments.
Other perks will be fulfilled within the time period. You will be notified about any date or shipping changes if they arise.
 
Other ways to contribute.
You are able to contribute in other ways if you are unable to do so monetarily:
You can follow the campaign by clicking the heart next to the back it button.

So why do you never see my face?
Because it’s not about me. It’s about the 'Caged Birds'!



So who are they? And where do they come from… and why don’t you know their work?
These 'Caged Birds' come from the area along the Mekong River which is sometimes referred to as ‘Indochina’.


This project is to make a top-quality Album that will give some exceptional people an opportunity to have their talents appreciated on the world stage; and
     you can help...

We are not trying to bring the folk music of Indochina to the outside world. There are splendid festivals and cultural events in Europe and America doing just that. 
We are making full-on, high-end, contemporary pop-dance music.
But there is a lot of that around, so what makes this special? We are incorporating the unique sounds of Indochina, created by local musicians using the traditional instruments of the area. 

Our goal is to finish the Album
     and to promote it with a high-class Music Video, and Live Performances. My Campaign is to raise $50,000 US, which
     will be enough to push the project to the point where it creates its own
     momentum.

So how will the money be used? Obviously, doing all this locally is going to be considerably cheaper than it would be in London, New York, Tokyo or Seoul; and the facilities are already in place. 
Recording: $15,000
Video $15,000 
Initial CD & DVD Manufacturing, Packaging, Campaign costs, etc.: $8,000 
Create & develop social media presence: $3,000
Live Performances (incl. rehearsals, etc.): $9,000.

<p align=""center"" style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt;""><b><i>""LA MÚSICA LLEGA AL ALMA...PERO UN MENSAJE
POSITIVO LA LLENA""</i></b></span></p>
<p>Hola mi nombre es Jose Cañas y veo la vida a través de unas
Gafas Rojas. Con ellas,<span>  </span>recorro
ciudades y países cantando y llevando un mensaje de esperanza a través de la
música.</p>
<p>Vivo en Costa Rica, país que se ha denominado como ""El
más feliz del mundo"" y creo que la influencia de esta tierra -en la cual
no tenemos ejército- ha rebozado mis letras de la paz que transpira nuestro
entorno y mucho amor a la vida.</p>
<p>Desde niño aprendí que unir la música con mensajes positivos
resultaba en experiencias enriquecedoras de vida. La música nos acompaña en
todo a lo largo de nuestra estancia en este mundo y a pesar de que,
comercialmente, tenemos excelentes canciones hoy día; existen muy pocas que nos
motiven a avanzar y a buscar buenos cambios en nuestra rutina diaria.</p>
<p>Retado continuamente por ese pensamiento fue que empecé
-hace aproximadamente 10 años- de manera formal y<span>  </span>profesional mi carrera como cantante y compositor. Hace unos
3 años, mi carrera dio un giro y empecé a acompañar mi imagen con las Gafas
Rojas.</p>
<p>Viendo el mundo desde las Gafas Rojas también las vi
convertirse en una plataforma social que ha ayudado y apoyado a varias
fundaciones costarricenses, ONGs y organismos internacionales como FAO de las
Naciones Unidas, siempre a través de la música.</p>
<p>Es que la música tiene el poder de llegar al alma y de
alegrar momentos; pero también de ayudar a construir diferentes realidades
sociales. El proyecto musical que les presento hoy no solo busca alegrar a las
personas que lo escucharán sino también motivar e ir un poco más allá,
proponiendo cambios y aportando con buen material para que suenen más canciones
con propósito y mensajes de vida en medios comerciales.</p>
<p>Lejos de comprometerse en el intento, el mensaje y la
calidad musical se potencian para que -comercialmente- la música sea exitosa y
llegue a más personas de las que regularmente son impactadas por estas
canciones con mensajes positivos. Mi proyecto consiste de dos discos EP que formarán
un solo álbum titulado: ""Del corazón...al alma"".</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>ACERCA DE LOS DISCOS</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
""Del corazón"" será un disco producido 100% en Costa Rica, junto al
importante productor costarricense, </span><b>Carlos Tapado Vargas</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. Tapado ha destacado
en el ambiente nacional e internacional al ser ganador en múltiples ocasiones
de premios Latin Grammys junto a </span><b>Rubén Blades</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> y el Grupo </span><b>Editus</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">, entre muchos
otros éxitos de su carrera. Recientemente trabajó junto a </span><b>Alanis Morissette</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> con
quien produjo el soundtrack de un documental sobre Costa Rica.</span></p>
<p>El disco reunirá también a grandes compositores
costarricenses con quienes, a través de ritmos latinoamericanos que nos harán
bailar, cantar y disfrutar, inspiraremos almas con mensajes de amor perfecto en
sus canciones.</p>
<p><b>“Del corazón” contará con la Marca País “esencial Costa
Rica”</b>, una licencia otorgada debido a la exposición internacional que tendrá
esta producción tan llena de talento costarricense. De hecho, soy el <b>primer
artista </b>en mi país que recibe dicha mención y eso me llena de orgullo, porque
con este disco queremos hacer algo de Costa Rica para el mundo.</p>
<p>Algunos nombres que estarán presentes en este disco son los
de <b>Debi Nova</b>, con quien en un pasado canté la canción “Alimento para el alma” y
el del Grupo <b>Malpaís</b>, grandes músicos que han llevado la música costarricense a
otro nivel, entre otros.</p>
<p><b>El otro disco titulado ""Al alma"" </b>es un disco que
ya compuse con <b>Jesús Adrián Romero, Daniel Fraire y Mike Rodríguez</b> y será
producido por estos dos últimos grandes músicos en Monterrey (México). Las
canciones tendrán un mensaje de esperanza y ánimo para motivar a la gente a
encontrar lo que los acerque a su espiritualidad y les brinde paz. Tendremos
invitados muy queridos en este medio como lo es el cantante <b>Daniel Calveti</b>.</p>
<p>Al ser un artista independiente no cuento con el apoyo de
disqueras; sin embargo, el poder de la música radica en unir a las personas en
sentimientos o “lugares comunes”. Como todos quienes soñamos por alcanzar
metas, hacer este proyecto involucra no solo un anhelo sino también trabajo y
recursos por los cuales estoy dispuesto a seguir esforzándome como lo he hecho
con mi equipo hasta el día de hoy, con quienes veo orgullosamente hacia atrás
todo lo que<span>  </span>hemos alcanzado. Es
increíble que de manera independiente y con recursos tan limitados, hayamos
llegado tan lejos. Definitivamente, hemos visto la ayuda de Dios.</p>
<p>Es imposible para mí realizar una obra que no contemple la
visión a través de la Gafas Rojas y su proyecto social. Es por eso que la
música de este proyecto no solo dejará un impacto en quienes la escuchen, sino
que beneficiará a la <b>Asociación Síndrome de Down en Costa Rica (ASIDOWN)</b>,
quienes con un trabajo constante y tangible han luchado por la inclusión social
en nuestro país. Con las ventas del disco se destinará un 15% para ASIDOWN y
además, contaremos con unos paquetes de donativos mediante los cuales usted
también podrá ser parte de Gafas Rojas y ayudar directamente a dicha
organización al destinarse un 10% de su donación a esta buena causa.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>LOS MONTOS </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Para realizar
este proyecto que llevará 10 canciones, producidas por grandes productores en
Monterrey (México) y Costa Rica, necesitamos los siguientes recursos:</span></p>
<p><span lang=""ES-MX"">-Pre
Producción (Promoción mediática para el nuevo proyecto -México DF, Dallas,
Houston, Miami y Orlando), estudio, músicos para sesiones, viajes para escribir
canciones con algunos músicos (México DF/ Monterrey y Miami) $14.870 USD</span> </p>
<p><span lang=""ES-MX"">- Costos de
grabación (Productores, músicos para sesiones, studio, mixing, mastering, arreglista)
$43.100 USD (10 canciones)</span></p>
<p><span lang=""ES-MX"">-Trabajo
artístico para el álbum, fotos y diseño de embalaje $850 USD</span></p>
<p><span lang=""ES-MX"">-Manufactura
del álbum (1.000 unidades) $1.534 USD</span></p>
<p><span lang=""ES-MX"">- Relaciones
públicas, publicidad y mercadeo para promoción -primera parte- en Centroamérica
(Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panamá y El Salvador), Estados unidos <span> </span>(Miami, Dallas and Houston) y México (DF
y Monterrey. Agencia comunicativa y gastos de viaje</span> $17.000 USD</p>
<p>-2 Videoclips para los sencillos $4.500</p>
<p>El costo total del proyecto es de $81.854 USD, sin embargo,
hemos logrado avanzar trabajo e invertir en el proyecto $27.353 USD. Este
dinero se ha utilizado en etapas de promoción internacional y preproducción así
como composición del disco. Para poder continuar con el proyecto y terminar los
discos, el financiamiento básico total que necesitamos es de <b>$54.501 USD.</b> </p>
<p></p>
<p>Sé que es una cantidad fuerte de dinero, pero hemos llegado
tan lejos, cosechando grandes éxitos con recursos tan limitados que me atrevo a
soñar que hay personas que, como yo, saben que la música<span>  </span>tiene el poder de cambiar el mundo y
nos ayudarán a terminar esta buena obra.</p>
<p><span> </span>El sueño y el
proyecto no son sencillos, pero tenemos la bendición de contar con el respaldo
que brindan los grandes alcances logrados y eso habla del grado de compromiso y
trabajo que tenemos con una labor que tiene ya más de 10 años, tres discos
compactos grabados, muchas giras exitosas de conciertos junto a grandes
artistas y participación en grandes medios de comunicación internacional.</p>
<p></p>
<p>El proyecto ya inició, por lo que -en el desafortunado
escenario de no lograr recoger todos los fondos- con las donaciones que
recibamos emprenderemos el trabajo de igual manera y produciremos la cantidad
de canciones que podamos pagar, las cuales promocionaremos para crear empatía
con nuestro trabajo y así seguir en la búsqueda de oportunidades que generen
recursos para ir logrando sacar el proyecto adelante. Así seguiríamos, sin
rendirnos, hasta sacar el álbum completo; ambos conceptos<span>  </span>juntos: <b>""Del corazón...al
alma""</b>.</p>
<p>Diariamente escuchamos música en las radios y medios, pero
la imperante necesidad de más canciones que nos acerquen a lo bueno nos obliga
a comprometernos al máximo con el proyecto y extraer de este álbum canciones
comercialmente exitosas. Con los dos discos pasados he tenido la oportunidad de
compartir escenario con <b>Fonseca, Gaby Moreno, Marc Anthony, Juan Luis Guerra,
Franco De Vita, Jesús Adrián Romero, Michael W Smith, Newsboys, Jarabe de Palo,
Debi Nova, Alex Campos y Tercer Cielo</b>, entre otros. Con este nuevo disco
queremos repetir y aumentar el alcance que ya hemos logrado.</p>
<p>Tengo la fe puesta en que lograremos el propósito del disco.
Su donativo es de suma importancia para este proyecto, y -por trillado que
suene- el tamaño del donativo no lo hace menos, ya que su valor reside en que
aún hay gente que tiene en su corazón la esperanza de ver un proyecto como éste
y poner en acción sus intenciones; mismas que sabemos inspirarán a otros a ser
parte de esta música con propósito. Ayúdenos a compartir esta campaña en sus
redes para ser más y llegar a más personas. Indiegogo tiene herramientas a
través de las cuales podemos hacer pública esta información y ser de bendición
y apoyo en este proceso. ¡Un millón de gracias y bendiciones, nos escuchamos
pronto! </p>

</div></div>","""LA MÚSICA LLEGA AL ALMA...PERO UN MENSAJE
POSITIVO LA LLENA""
Hola mi nombre es Jose Cañas y veo la vida a través de unas
Gafas Rojas. Con ellas,  recorro
ciudades y países cantando y llevando un mensaje de esperanza a través de la
música.
Vivo en Costa Rica, país que se ha denominado como ""El
más feliz del mundo"" y creo que la influencia de esta tierra -en la cual
no tenemos ejército- ha rebozado mis letras de la paz que transpira nuestro
entorno y mucho amor a la vida.
Desde niño aprendí que unir la música con mensajes positivos
resultaba en experiencias enriquecedoras de vida. La música nos acompaña en
todo a lo largo de nuestra estancia en este mundo y a pesar de que,
comercialmente, tenemos excelentes canciones hoy día; existen muy pocas que nos
motiven a avanzar y a buscar buenos cambios en nuestra rutina diaria.
Retado continuamente por ese pensamiento fue que empecé
-hace aproximadamente 10 años- de manera formal y  profesional mi carrera como cantante y compositor. Hace unos
3 años, mi carrera dio un giro y empecé a acompañar mi imagen con las Gafas
Rojas.
Viendo el mundo desde las Gafas Rojas también las vi
convertirse en una plataforma social que ha ayudado y apoyado a varias
fundaciones costarricenses, ONGs y organismos internacionales como FAO de las
Naciones Unidas, siempre a través de la música.
Es que la música tiene el poder de llegar al alma y de
alegrar momentos; pero también de ayudar a construir diferentes realidades
sociales. El proyecto musical que les presento hoy no solo busca alegrar a las
personas que lo escucharán sino también motivar e ir un poco más allá,
proponiendo cambios y aportando con buen material para que suenen más canciones
con propósito y mensajes de vida en medios comerciales.
Lejos de comprometerse en el intento, el mensaje y la
calidad musical se potencian para que -comercialmente- la música sea exitosa y
llegue a más personas de las que regularmente son impactadas por estas
canciones con mensajes positivos. Mi proyecto consiste de dos discos EP que formarán
un solo álbum titulado: ""Del corazón...al alma"".

ACERCA DE LOS DISCOS
""Del corazón"" será un disco producido 100% en Costa Rica, junto al
importante productor costarricense, Carlos Tapado Vargas. Tapado ha destacado
en el ambiente nacional e internacional al ser ganador en múltiples ocasiones
de premios Latin Grammys junto a Rubén Blades y el Grupo Editus, entre muchos
otros éxitos de su carrera. Recientemente trabajó junto a Alanis Morissette con
quien produjo el soundtrack de un documental sobre Costa Rica.
El disco reunirá también a grandes compositores
costarricenses con quienes, a través de ritmos latinoamericanos que nos harán
bailar, cantar y disfrutar, inspiraremos almas con mensajes de amor perfecto en
sus canciones.
“Del corazón” contará con la Marca País “esencial Costa
Rica”, una licencia otorgada debido a la exposición internacional que tendrá
esta producción tan llena de talento costarricense. De hecho, soy el primer
artista en mi país que recibe dicha mención y eso me llena de orgullo, porque
con este disco queremos hacer algo de Costa Rica para el mundo.
Algunos nombres que estarán presentes en este disco son los
de Debi Nova, con quien en un pasado canté la canción “Alimento para el alma” y
el del Grupo Malpaís, grandes músicos que han llevado la música costarricense a
otro nivel, entre otros.
El otro disco titulado ""Al alma"" es un disco que
ya compuse con Jesús Adrián Romero, Daniel Fraire y Mike Rodríguez y será
producido por estos dos últimos grandes músicos en Monterrey (México). Las
canciones tendrán un mensaje de esperanza y ánimo para motivar a la gente a
encontrar lo que los acerque a su espiritualidad y les brinde paz. Tendremos
invitados muy queridos en este medio como lo es el cantante Daniel Calveti.
Al ser un artista independiente no cuento con el apoyo de
disqueras; sin embargo, el poder de la música radica en unir a las personas en
sentimientos o “lugares comunes”. Como todos quienes soñamos por alcanzar
metas, hacer este proyecto involucra no solo un anhelo sino también trabajo y
recursos por los cuales estoy dispuesto a seguir esforzándome como lo he hecho
con mi equipo hasta el día de hoy, con quienes veo orgullosamente hacia atrás
todo lo que  hemos alcanzado. Es
increíble que de manera independiente y con recursos tan limitados, hayamos
llegado tan lejos. Definitivamente, hemos visto la ayuda de Dios.
Es imposible para mí realizar una obra que no contemple la
visión a través de la Gafas Rojas y su proyecto social. Es por eso que la
música de este proyecto no solo dejará un impacto en quienes la escuchen, sino
que beneficiará a la Asociación Síndrome de Down en Costa Rica (ASIDOWN),
quienes con un trabajo constante y tangible han luchado por la inclusión social
en nuestro país. Con las ventas del disco se destinará un 15% para ASIDOWN y
además, contaremos con unos paquetes de donativos mediante los cuales usted
también podrá ser parte de Gafas Rojas y ayudar directamente a dicha
organización al destinarse un 10% de su donación a esta buena causa.
 
LOS MONTOS Para realizar
este proyecto que llevará 10 canciones, producidas por grandes productores en
Monterrey (México) y Costa Rica, necesitamos los siguientes recursos:
-Pre
Producción (Promoción mediática para el nuevo proyecto -México DF, Dallas,
Houston, Miami y Orlando), estudio, músicos para sesiones, viajes para escribir
canciones con algunos músicos (México DF/ Monterrey y Miami) $14.870 USD 
- Costos de
grabación (Productores, músicos para sesiones, studio, mixing, mastering, arreglista)
$43.100 USD (10 canciones)
-Trabajo
artístico para el álbum, fotos y diseño de embalaje $850 USD
-Manufactura
del álbum (1.000 unidades) $1.534 USD
- Relaciones
públicas, publicidad y mercadeo para promoción -primera parte- en Centroamérica
(Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panamá y El Salvador), Estados unidos  (Miami, Dallas and Houston) y México (DF
y Monterrey. Agencia comunicativa y gastos de viaje $17.000 USD
-2 Videoclips para los sencillos $4.500
El costo total del proyecto es de $81.854 USD, sin embargo,
hemos logrado avanzar trabajo e invertir en el proyecto $27.353 USD. Este
dinero se ha utilizado en etapas de promoción internacional y preproducción así
como composición del disco. Para poder continuar con el proyecto y terminar los
discos, el financiamiento básico total que necesitamos es de $54.501 USD. 

Sé que es una cantidad fuerte de dinero, pero hemos llegado
tan lejos, cosechando grandes éxitos con recursos tan limitados que me atrevo a
soñar que hay personas que, como yo, saben que la música  tiene el poder de cambiar el mundo y
nos ayudarán a terminar esta buena obra.
 El sueño y el
proyecto no son sencillos, pero tenemos la bendición de contar con el respaldo
que brindan los grandes alcances logrados y eso habla del grado de compromiso y
trabajo que tenemos con una labor que tiene ya más de 10 años, tres discos
compactos grabados, muchas giras exitosas de conciertos junto a grandes
artistas y participación en grandes medios de comunicación internacional.

El proyecto ya inició, por lo que -en el desafortunado
escenario de no lograr recoger todos los fondos- con las donaciones que
recibamos emprenderemos el trabajo de igual manera y produciremos la cantidad
de canciones que podamos pagar, las cuales promocionaremos para crear empatía
con nuestro trabajo y así seguir en la búsqueda de oportunidades que generen
recursos para ir logrando sacar el proyecto adelante. Así seguiríamos, sin
rendirnos, hasta sacar el álbum completo; ambos conceptos  juntos: ""Del corazón...al
alma"".
Diariamente escuchamos música en las radios y medios, pero
la imperante necesidad de más canciones que nos acerquen a lo bueno nos obliga
a comprometernos al máximo con el proyecto y extraer de este álbum canciones
comercialmente exitosas. Con los dos discos pasados he tenido la oportunidad de
compartir escenario con Fonseca, Gaby Moreno, Marc Anthony, Juan Luis Guerra,
Franco De Vita, Jesús Adrián Romero, Michael W Smith, Newsboys, Jarabe de Palo,
Debi Nova, Alex Campos y Tercer Cielo, entre otros. Con este nuevo disco
queremos repetir y aumentar el alcance que ya hemos logrado.
Tengo la fe puesta en que lograremos el propósito del disco.
Su donativo es de suma importancia para este proyecto, y -por trillado que
suene- el tamaño del donativo no lo hace menos, ya que su valor reside en que
aún hay gente que tiene en su corazón la esperanza de ver un proyecto como éste
y poner en acción sus intenciones; mismas que sabemos inspirarán a otros a ser
parte de esta música con propósito. Ayúdenos a compartir esta campaña en sus
redes para ser más y llegar a más personas. Indiegogo tiene herramientas a
través de las cuales podemos hacer pública esta información y ser de bendición
y apoyo en este proceso. ¡Un millón de gracias y bendiciones, nos escuchamos
pronto!

""MUSIC GETS TO THE SOUL… BUT A POSITIVE MESSAGE FILLS IT”
Hello, my name is Jose Cañas and I see life through a pair of Red Glasses. With them, I travel cities and countries; singing and bringing a message of hopethrough music. 
I live in Costa Rica, a country that has been denominated as the “Happiest country in the world” and I think the influence of this land -in which we have no army- has fulfilled the lyrics of my music of the peace the country exhales and a lot of love for life. 
Since I was a little kid I learned that fuse music with positive messages gave as a result enriching life experiences. Music accompanies us lifelong and although, commercially, we have excellent songs nowadays; there are very few that will motivate us toseek changes in our daily routine in that pursuit of happiness we are all in.
Dared by that thought, I started -about 10 years ago- my songwriting career in a professional and formal manner. 3 years ago, my career turned and I started to relate my image to the Red Glasses. 
Watching the world through my Red Glasses I also saw them develop into a social platform that has helped and supported many costarrican foundations, non-governmental organizations and International Organizations such as United Nation´s FAO; always through music. 
Music has the power to reach to one’s soul and makejoyful moments, but also to help constructing different social realities. The musical project that I’m presenting today, not only searches to cheer people up but to motivate and go a little bit further, proposing changes and contributing to the porpoise of getting more songs with true value and life messages to the “commercial media”.
During that process, nor the message or the music quality gets compromised, actually, they are both potentiated for the music to be commercially successful and gets to more people. My project consists of two EP disks,together they will form the record named “Del corazón… Al alma” (From the heart… to the soul)
ABOUT THE ALBUMS ""Del corazón"" will be a disk produced 100% in Costa Rica, next to the respectable costarrican producer, Carlos “Tapado” Vargas. Tapado has distinguished in both the national and international music ambience as a multiple winner of Latin Grammy awards next to Rubén Blades and the Editus group among many other recognitions in his carrer. Recently, “Tapado” worked next to Alanis Morissette to produce the soundtrack for a documentary about Costa Rica.
The disk will reunite great costarrican music writers and composers with whom we will engrave the perfect love concept into Latin-American songs that will make us dance, sing, enjoy and overall… Inspire us. 
“Del corazón” will also have the “essential Costa Rica” country trademark stamp, as a part of its importance for the international exposition of this costarrican talent filled production. In fact, I´m proudly the first artist in my country who receives this mention and it fills me with joy because with this disk we want to make something from Costa Rica to the world. 
I´ll be featuring some songs with great artist like Debi Nova –with whom I previously recorded the song “Alimento para el alma- and the national group Malpaís, remarkable musicians that have taken costarrican music to another level, among others. 
The other disk named ""Al alma"" is a disk I already composed with the Mexican Singer Jesús Adrián Romero as well as Daniel Fraire y Mike Rodríguez, and it will be produced for Fraire and Rodríguez; big musicians fromMonterrey (México). The songs will have a hope message and they will motivate people to look for a greater spiritual balance in their life that will ultimately bring them peace. We will have guest artists on this disk too, like cherished musicians such as Daniel Calveti.
As an independent artist, I don´t have the support of a record label; however, the power of Music lies on its ability to bring people together through feelings or common life stages. Like everyone who´s struggling for a goal, this Project not only involves a yearning but also lots of work and resources that I´m willing to keep working on as I have done it with my team until today. With them, I proudly look back and we see everything we have accomplished so far, it is truly amazing that as an independent Project and with very limited resources we´ve come this far. Definitely, it’s only through the support God has given us. 
It is impossible for me to start a project that doesn´t contemplate the vision thorugh the Red Glasses. Therefore, the music produced on this project will not only impact the people that will hear it but also it will benefit The Costarrican Down Syndrome Association (ASIDOWN for its name in Spanish) an association with a constant and tangible work in programs that look for social inclusion From the disk sales response, there will be a 15% destined ASIDOWN and also we havepackages in which your contribution will directly help ASIDOWN with a 10% of your donation.
THE AMOUNTS For the realization of this project that will consist of 10 songs produced by the greatestproducers in Monterrey (México) and from Costa Rica, we need the following resources:
-Pre Production (media promotion for the new project -México DF, Dallas, Houston, Miami y Orlando), studio, session musicians, travel for songwriting with some composers (México DF/ Monterrey y Miami) $14.870 USD
-Recording costs (producers, session musicians, studio, mixing, mastering, musical arranger) $43.100 USD (10 songs)
-Album Artwork, photos and packing design $850 USD
-Album manufacture (1.000 Units) $1.534 USD
-Promotion PR (First stage) in Central America (Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panamá y El Salvador), USA (Miami, Dallas and Houston) and Mexico (DF y Monterrey. PR Company and travel $17.000 USD
-2 Video clips for the singles $4.500
The total cost of the project is: $81.854 USD, however, we have been able to advance some of the work and invest $27.353 USD on it, all used for the international promotion and pre-production stages as well as disk composition. To be able to finish the disk and deliver the whole project, the basic total financing we need is $54.501 USD.
I know this is a really strong amount of money, but we´ve come so far, we´ve achieved so many with such limited resources that I know this will be a successful project and I can assure you is worth it. 
The dream and the project are not simple, but we have the blessing to have many past triumphs that can back us up and that demonstrates the amount of commitment and work we have done with this career of over 10 years, 3 CD´s recorded, many successful concert tours and participation in big international communication media chains.

This donation is only available for Mexico, US and Central America and we have only 3 spots, it consists on me travelling personally to your country and under auditorium conditions I´ll give the motivational speech: “Journalist, singer and stutterer… What´s the story you need to beat?” It consists in confronting our fears, difficulties and insecurities and through a story make you think and believe you have everything you need to make it, turning your weakness into your greatest virtues and blessings in life.

We will have 3 spots for this life changing speech. 
$7.000. Share music and celebrate life is an invaluable thing to do. This project was born first of all because God put in my life reasons to sing and celebrate that I have a second chance and second, because of the music and the strength a song and its message have. I have a deep gratefulness for your donation and as I said, I´d like to celebrate it but this time in your house with an acoustic showcase in a trio formation. Together we will define a date of mutual convenience and I will arrive on that date with the musicians to share with your family part of my Music and all this beautiful Project you are now a part of. We will have 2 spots for this donation and I will travel either to US or Central America to share my music and a coffee in the comfort of your own house. All travel and accommodations will be assumed by us and besides that, as part of the Red Glasses organization, we will give 10% of your donation to The Costarrican Down Syndrome Association. We have 3 spots for this donation. 
The project already began so if -in an unfortunate scenario- we cannot raise the whole amount we need to raise; the ones that we did received will start the job either ways and we´ll record the songs we can afford. They will be promoted to create empathy in our work and generate opportunities that may lead is to complete the amount to have both “the heart” and “the soul” out on the market. 
We have lots of Music in the radio and different mass media, but we do need more songs to lead us to the good, to the positive and get us closer to what is really worth itat the same time we make them commercially appealing. With the 2 previous CD´s I´ve been able to perform in different concerts with Fonseca, Gaby Moreno, Marc Anthony, Juan Luis Guerra, Franco De Vita, JesúsAdrián Romero, Michael W Smith, Newsboys, Jarabe de Palo, Debi Nova, Alex Campos, Tercer Cielo, among others. With this new disc our aim is to repeat and increase the reach we have had. 
I have my faith sold on this being a success and us being able to finish the Project. Your donation is really important to this project, it doesn´t matter how big or small it is: What matters is the heart that you put in your donation and the inspiration that it will be to others, to motivate and inspire them to be a part of this Project of Music with porpoise you decided to believe in. You can also help us sharing this campaign in you social media networks and reach more people. Indiegogo has the tools for you to share this and be a great support and bless us through that on this Project. ¡Thank you so much, we will hear each other soon!

<p>[La mano de Parisi...] born in 2013.
The desire of some music students is to do what they love most, while working
with people and friends who want to be part of thier story.</p>
<p>This story begings with four
musicians, Paul, Jeremy, Sergio and Juan. Between laughter and sadness
(fortunately more laughs than tears) forged friendships, shared experiences,
dreams and ideas became the songs.</p>
<p>The name comes from the history of
Parisi, a French string quartet musicians who seriously injured one of his
hands. It is unknown if he could play again, but the story is so shocking to
us, that we decided  as a tribute use the
name ""The Hand of Parisi"",  a
tribute that is not just for the musican, but for the concept of being a
musician, the sacrifices that accompany the profession, dreams that inspire and
the melody that grants a chorus of satisfaction.</p>
<p>In march 2015 we created “Que Nada te
Detenga” our first single. This videoclip was </p>
<p>made by students of the Universidad de
la Sabana, great friends who are now also working on the production of a new
single, ""Bailame"".</p>
<p>Thanks to another great team from the
Universidad de la Sabana we performed a live session online via our concert
""A Contraluz"" that will soon be released.</p>
<p>With much effort and passion and with
the support of many people we will move forward to achieve our first album and
grow professionally.</p>
<p><b>The project:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our project is to create a music video
for our new and second single ""Bailame"". It is a high quality project
that needs your support to be performed. We have been working on the song since
the beginning of the year, creating a wonderful idea which is the product of
hard work and effort.</p>
<p><b>¿How we are going to make it?</b></p>
<p>Making a videoclip costs a lot of
money, because we need to pay for all of the production and the technical
requirements, and another things. </p>
<p>But we are not alone in this journey,
we have an excellent working group, a production team composed of Audiovisual
Communication students who are taking this Project on as their thesis. </p>
<p>This allows us to recieve many
important things for the development, as human talent and other equipment are
delivered by their school. We have been working on this since the beginning of
the year, and we have the cooperation of many people, but we need a little more
support to conclude this story, we need $ 1500 US dollars, with this we can
finish our music video.</p>
<p>We want to make this posible, but we
need your support. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Learn more about “Bailame”</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>“Bailame” It is a song that requires
much effort because of the concept. </p>
<p>The main idea of the videoclip is<b>:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>""A bar of the 20s, where glamor of those who laugh and enjoy are
interrupted by the presence of a woman who wakes temptation in them, thus
creating chaos and foring the bar goers to face their animal instincts""</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>The elegance that characterizes the
selected time, but also social problems and political changes which covered
this decade, are justifying the adaptation of the video at a bar in the 20s,
where the strength, power and energy of the song can excel. Approached from an
exaggeration and harmony in action with the essence of the absurd, the
imagination will complement the song and a great product will be achieved.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How we are going to use the money?</b></p>
<p>We already have the space and
recording equipment but the art department demands much more work and money to
complete the  video concept. With your
help we can make it posible and get a high quality product. The money will be
used primarily in this area.</p>
<p><b>The plan: </b></p>
<p>We want to keep growing as a band,
sound at all major stations, satisfy our audience and especially continue producing
quality music.</p>
<p>“Bailame” It is a wonderful idea that
can go far, if we raise over the goal for this project, we will be very happy,
because we can use this money to fund surpluses like food for the video,
advertise our work and even to record a new videoclip for our next single, and more many
things that will grow all our effort. </p>

</p><p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>Speakrs is an Indie-Pop collaboration
between songwriter/producers Izaac Burkhart and Daniel Smith.  Hailing from the same hometown suburb of
Minneapolis, MN the duo have been long-time friends, as well as musical
associates. Expanding on the idea of a sort of “musical think-tank,” the two
desired an open writing environment that placed a premium on creative liberty and
a return to a simpler, less restrictive style of production. These sessions
gathered a natural momentum and took shape into what would become their debut
album, “Afterglow.” </p>
<p><b>What We’ve Done</b> </p>
<p>We want to introduce Speakrs 
to the world and create excitement about our debut release!</p>
<p>The Afterglow EP was entirely self-produced and engineered
by us. (Izaac and Dan). The plan has been to lay the groundwork and create a
sample of our vision before gathering support for the project. As totally
independent artists, it can be tough to find effective ways to promote new
projects; we knew an Indiegogo campaign would be the perfect way.  We are proud to introduce you to these 5 songs
and excited to gather resources to bring you a debut full length!</p>
<p><b>What We Hope To Do</b></p>
<p>Our goal is two-fold:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>First: To celebrate the release of our debut EP
“Afterglow” with all of you  </p>
<p>   and
send it out into the world with a bang!</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span> Second: To
bring you a debut full length record, made up of 10 all new </p>
<p>     tracks, by Fall 2016! </p>
<p>To paint it in broad strokes, we are ambitious,
entrepreneurial musicians with access to limited resources. I know we are not
alone, hence the massive popularity of crowd-funding. For the many of us in
this category, it can be a lengthy and risky adventure creating a record at the
independent level. We want to shorten the wait and keep the momentum alive. But
beyond any of those reasons, we want you all to be a part of the process this
time around! We hope the 5 songs off Afterglow inspire you to give your attention and support. With
your help, we will be bringing you a debut full length this time next year! </p>
<p>Take a look at the “Perks” section to see all of the ways we
have planned to keep you involved and up-to-date on the making of the record. We
believe strongly in the potential of the project and accomplishing this will be
a huge investment in the future of Speakrs!</p>

<p></p>
<p>Ever since I became a Unitarian Universalist I noticed there was a lack of exciting music in liberal religion. In America it seems like spiritual music is dominated by Evangelical Christian society,  whether it is a sing along pop rock hit on the radio or vibrant gospel music. And while i love both types and am inspired immensely by them (I love Hillsong &amp; Israel Houghton), I want to see some more progressive music for a liberal and new thought audience. I want to spread something positive and inspirational that speaks to people of all faiths. I am not on some crusade to change all religious music, I just want to add another side to the story that has been there for thousands of years. </p>
<p>There was a report this year that the “Nones” in America, people who have no religious affiliation, are on the rise. There is a very large group of people in America who believe to be religious they have to hate their gay friends, destroy the environment, or even ignore who they really are so they want nothing to do with religion all together. There are churches that have LBGT ministers. There are churches where half the congregation are atheist or don’t believe in the literal virgin birth. Even if church just isn't for you I hope that these songs can speak to your soul. </p>
<p>Releasing this album will bring me one step closer to see more of this type of sacred  music. Once the album is completed I can start looking to publish my music, getting into hymnals and worship repertoire. writing for other artist, producing other new thought composers, touring and playing this music in other cities and churches. Licensing songs for film, tv, and advertising would also be a possibility. The key point is that I need to put this music out there and let it do whatever the spirit will have it do.  </p>

My name is Joshua Long from Baltimore, Maryland.  At the humble age of 29 I am a professional Musician, lover of all things spiritual, Unitarian Universalist, Progressive Christian, and a Tai Chi student. 
Oh! And I still like to watch dragon ball z! LOL!
I currently serve at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Annapolis where I am Director of Contemporary Music & Music director for AWAKE ministries. I also play piano and direct the choir at Saint Lukes United Methodist church in Reiserstown, MD. I gig regularly and teach music lessons in the Baltimore Metro Area. 
“All God’s Children” is a testament to what I believe about humanity. We are all created beings on this planet, evolved over billions of years and brought into this very moment for a purpose. Over my 29 years of existence I have learned some valuable lessons along my journey, and as one of God’s children I want to share this little bit of wisdom with the rest of my family.

<p>The Kaufman Center's <b>Face The Music</b> is the only youth ensemble in the U.S. dedicated to the creation and performance of music by living composers. The 200+ member group has taken its place as a full-fledged player in New York City’s vibrant contemporary classical scene, rapidly becoming what Allan Kozinn of the New York Times has called “<i>a force in the New York new-music world.</i>”<br/></p>
<p><strong>Mantra Youth Percussion</strong> is the first youth percussion ensemble of its kind exclusively dedicated to the creation and performance of 21st century music. MYP seeks to foster the next generation of performers through collaborations with living composers, high-level ensemble playing, and diverse performance opportunities with an emphasis on creativity and artistry.  <br/></p>
<p>Of this MMNY commission, Jenny Undercofler (director, Face The Music) explains: </p>
<blockquote>This is an incredibly unique experience for the kids, this idea of creating a piece that is actually using part of the infrastructure of the city. This is music that deeply belongs to the kids... it's music that's being created now, it's music that's being created for them to play, and it's also music that is directly part of their city!</blockquote>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The direct benefits of contributing to the creation of a new piece of classical music, beyond enjoying the performance, are perhaps not as tangible as, say, donating to a campaign to create a new, more amazing watch. But for classical music itself, support from individuals to create new works is vital. Without the financial support of people throughout the ages, we would not have many of the great works that define the western musical canon.</p>
<p>The creation of new works in the classical field is what keeps the genre vibrant. It is what injects new life into an old art form.</p>
<p>In the <b>Concerto for Buildings</b>, there is the added benefit of bringing to life a new piece of classical music performed by youth ensembles. </p>
<p>Literally nowhere else in the world are there not one, but two contemporary ensembles for kids focused completely on the creation and performance of new classical music. We are fortunate to live in such a place as New York City. The students in these two groups are equally fortunate to have the opportunity to work on complex music written by living composers — and more often than not, to learn from them directly. </p>
<p>This new work will not only give the students the opportunity to work directly with high-level composers, but it will give the students, as their director Jenny Undercofler says, ""a little secret access to get do something they wouldn't get to do otherwise... because who gets to drum on buildings!""</p>
<p>As well, for all three organizations — Make Music New York, Face The Music, and Mantra Youth Percussion — this will be the first major commission the groups have been able to undertake, either individually or collectively. Undercofler explains that Face The Music does not get the chance to commission music, largely for financial reasons, so ""for us to participate in a collective commissioning project is exciting because it allows us to access new work by grown-up composers, that's brand new work and that is something we don't get to do enough of!""</p>
<p>Thank you for reading about our project! Please consider supporting it and perhaps as importantly... please, please share our campaign on social media. The more eyes that can view this campaign, the better!</p>
<p>Many, many thanks.</p>

For this Concerto for Buildings, the composers will use the percussive qualities of the buildings (with the help of 24 percussionists), combining those timbres and pitches with a full orchestra set-up in the street! It will truly be unlike any other musical work.

What We Need& What You Get
We are asking our community of friends and supporters to help us make history, help create an unforgettable experience for New York City, and help bring a singular and engaging piece of music to life. By contributing to this campaign you will be funding the composers who are writing these works, the rental of a professional sound system and personnel, instrument rental, music stands, chairs, and tents for the kids and their instruments.
With your donations, you can receive:



CD/download of the live performance

Tshirt and a printed event poster
signed copy of the score
invitation to exclusive party at a SoHo loft
dinner at a SoHo restaurant
private concert for you and your friends
and more!


    The Impact The direct benefits of contributing to the creation of a new piece of classical music, beyond enjoying the performance, are perhaps not as tangible as, say, donating to a campaign to create a new, more amazing watch. But for classical music itself, support from individuals to create new works is vital. Without the financial support of people throughout the ages, we would not have many of the great works that define the western musical canon.
The creation of new works in the classical field is what keeps the genre vibrant. It is what injects new life into an old art form.
In the Concerto for Buildings, there is the added benefit of bringing to life a new piece of classical music performed by youth ensembles. 
Literally nowhere else in the world are there not one, but two contemporary ensembles for kids focused completely on the creation and performance of new classical music. We are fortunate to live in such a place as New York City. The students in these two groups are equally fortunate to have the opportunity to work on complex music written by living composers — and more often than not, to learn from them directly. 
This new work will not only give the students the opportunity to work directly with high-level composers, but it will give the students, as their director Jenny Undercofler says, ""a little secret access to get do something they wouldn't get to do otherwise... because who gets to drum on buildings!""
As well, for all three organizations — Make Music New York, Face The Music, and Mantra Youth Percussion — this will be the first major commission the groups have been able to undertake, either individually or collectively. Undercofler explains that Face The Music does not get the chance to commission music, largely for financial reasons, so ""for us to participate in a collective commissioning project is exciting because it allows us to access new work by grown-up composers, that's brand new work and that is something we don't get to do enough of!""
Thank you for reading about our project! Please consider supporting it and perhaps as importantly... please, please share our campaign on social media. The more eyes that can view this campaign, the better!
Many, many thanks.

<h3>Dandelions? Oh, well...</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Iordache. I am a jazz and rock saxophone player and composer living in Bucharest, Romania. I have played and recorded with some of Romania's best bands and musicians. Currently I am leading my own jazz funk quartet, <a href=""http://www.iordache.ro/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Iordache</a>, and I'm playing with indie rock band Kumm. I recorded about 30 albums, including 5 under my own name. This is the 6th.</li>
<li>I had the idea of this particular project with plants a few years ago, in Germany, while trying to do something interesting with my friend and bassist Utu Pascu, while the van of our rock band Kumm was being repaired.</li>
<li>In Romania, most city kids have relatives in the countryside, so we both knew how to extract sound from dandelions. (As for playing the leaf, there are bona fide virtuosos of it on the folk music scene here. I don't even come close to these masters.) Utu recorded what we had played then, but the recording was lost.</li>
<li>Last spring, I noticed the dandelions in full bloom and remembered the whole thing. I set up to record an album of them. At first I thought it would be something to do during the weekend, but I ended up recording and mixing the whole thing for more than a month.</li>
<li>I decided, from the start, that I wouldn't compose anything beforehand. Each dandelion has its own sound and feel, which depends on its age, whether it grew in the sun or in the shadow, whether it rained in the last few days or not and probably other things I have no idea about. The same goes for the leaves. Since they are very unpredictable (they split and break) after a few attempts to record full tracks I decided I would work like they do in electronic music. That is, I would sample and loop and then record some more, until I felt the song was ready. Every tune  started with an improvised line based on what the plant wanted to sound like, so I might say they did half my job!</li>
<li>When you pre-order this weirdness, you will have contributed to the first jazz (or jazz related) album recorded with plants. Is it important? Well, I have no clue, so it's up to you to decide. What I do know is only that it was a lot of fun to make, and it opened my own ears to a whole new world of between-the-cracks pitches and melodies I wouldn't have thought of otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The music has already been recorded - <a href=""https://iordache.bandcamp.com/album/organic-natural"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">listen</a>! What next?</h3>
<p>I recorded the music at my home, so there were no studio costs. I also did some pre-mixing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The album was then professionally mixed in a studio, in Bucharest. Cost: $600.</li>
<li>The cover photography and design were made by Medicine Madison. The inside layout and full graphic design will be also made by her. The cost for everything: $600</li>
<li>The CD will be a ""digifile"" - just like a 4-panel Digipak, except for the plastic tray on the right. I found it stupid to make an album glorifying nature, only to have some useless plastic packaging it. It would be with us for the next three hundred years. So it's just good quality cardboard, with gloss UV coating. No plastic except for the CD itself. Production cost: $800 for the first 300 copies.</li>
<li>The album will be officially released in January or February 2008, with a contemporary dance show created by choreographer Andreea Novac, in Bucharest. Estimated costs for the show and the promotional campaign for the album: $1800.  The show will only happen if I reach my goal, or come fairly close to it. Otherwise, the extra money will be invested in promoting the album.</li>
<li>The album will be released by my own label, <a href=""/www.fiverhouse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fiver House Records</a>. If this goes well, I will adopt it as a model for other albums I will release in the future. If the goal is not met, all the digital-related perks will still stand, and a sufficient number of CD's will be made for those who pre-ordered them.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project will change the way you look at dandelions forever. For those interested, I will post a video on how to make a dandelion into a double reed instrument in seconds, then extract melodies out of it. Thus, everybody will be able to make their own music with dandelions and leaves. There are worse things one can do.</li>
<li>On the other hand, this will encourage me to keep doing experimental projects.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are no risks, except for the contemporary dance show - which is very important for me. My campaign runs until December 26. So the only risk, for those of you who don't move fast enough, is to get your CD after Christmas - especially for those outside Romania - shipping time will have to be considered.<br/>But you want it for Christmas, right?</p>

I wrote that song for an international Baha’i Conference in Montreal and set the names of the months in English and Arabic to music. The song had kind of a Caribbean feel and was a way of teaching my children (and myself) the names of the months and the order they appear in as part of the Badi Calendar.</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-db-_aOR4s&amp;t=1s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Listen to 'Song of the Months' Here</a></p><p>When I worked on the 2nd Baha’i World Congress in 1992, one of the songs was “The Garden of Ridvan”. Jimmy Seals had written a melody and lyric about the Blessed Beauty as we had previously discussed doing this project at that time and wanted to write and produce a song for each Baha’i Feast and each Holy Day. He and Kingsley Thurber and I co-wrote the “Garden of Ridvan” and so we incorporated the Feast of Beauty idea into that song that was part of the Oratorio at The 2nd Baha’i World Congress. So finally, in 2017, I started to write this collection of songs to honour each of the Baha’i Feasts and Holy Days and make recordings of each of these songs with a great choir and musicians.</p><p> </p><h3>The Badi Calendar</h3><p>The Badi Calendar is a new and universal way in which humans will measure time for centuries to come.   It was originated by a young Persian Prophet called The Bab (The Gate), whose message of the approaching maturity of the human race was announced on May 23rd, 1844, the day before the first telegraph message was sent by Samuel Morse to Alfred Vail from Washington to Baltimore and back saying, “What hath God wrought?”</p><p>This calendar was subsequently ratified by Baha’u’llah, the Manifestation of God who succeeded The Bab, who had been murdered in 1850 by Muhammad Shah of Iran 6 years after Morse’s message. Baha’u’llah confirmed that the Badi Calendar is based on the number 19, the number of unity, and that the 19 months of 19 days each are all named after attributes of God, Light, Mercy, Beauty, Knowledge, Glory and other inspiring qualities.</p><p>The 4 or 5 days that are left are the Intercalary Days which Baha’u’llah named Ayyam-i-Ha (The Days of Happiness). These days are also called Intercalary Days. They are days of hospitality, generosity and gift-giving and preparation for the Fast, which is the last month of the Badi Calendar called “Loftiness”.</p><p>The New Year is celebrated on the 1st day of the vernal equinox and is called Naw Ruz, which is also the ancient Persian Festival of the New Year. How appropriate that the first day of spring is the first day of the New Year.</p><p>In addition, there are 9 days during the Baha’i Year of the Badi Calendar where significant Holy Days are celebrated or commemorated and on which work is suspended. These include the births and deaths of the twin Founders of the Baha’i Dispensation, The Bab and Baha’u’llah, the celebration of their Festivals associated with the Announcement of their Missions and the celebration of the New Year. In addition, there are 2 Holy Days, The Day of the Covenant and The Ascension of Abdu’l-Baha, where work is not suspended and then an additional song for the period of Ayyam-i-Ha.</p><p>The Baha’i Feasts and Holy Days Songbook represents songs for each of these 19 months and songs for each of the Holy Days throughout the year.</p><p> </p><h3>The Feasts and Holy Days Songbook</h3><p>The gradual establishment of Baha’i culture has taken various forms in the beginning of a dispensation that will endure for 5000 centuries and represents the Golden Age of the human race. The primary expression of the Revelation of The Bab and Baha’u’llah so far has been in the art of architecture with the Institutions of the Faith like the Baha’i Temples in several continents and the beautiful buildings and gardens on Mount Carmel in Haifa where the Shrine of the Bab is situated and outside of Akka, Israel where Baha’u’llah’s Shrine and gardens rest. Architecture has always been the first expression of a new Revelation from God. For example, the new Baha’i Temple in Santiago, Chile is a very unique structure and was designed by a Canadian architect, Siamak Hariri.</p><p>Even though music is usually the last and most refined expression of the culture that is a fruition of a religious dispensation, i.e. the music of Bach and Beethoven and Mozart was the fruition of the Christian dispensation and appeared over 1600 years after the life of Jesus Christ, all of us involved will continue to make these feeble attempts to capture the glory of the Revelation of The Bab and Baha’u’llah through music.</p><p>It is my hope that these songs for the Feasts and Holy Days will become a way for the Baha’i Community to express their love and devotion for these noble teachings and draw them closer to the spirit and lives of The Bab and Baha’u’llah. It is also my hope that this effort will inspire other songwriters and singers to add to this repertoire so that the Baha’i Community worldwide will raise their voices in praise of these glorious ideals and celebrate the Founders of a new and united world civilization.</p><p>                             </p><h3>Countermeasure</h3><p>I started writing these Feasts and Holy Days songs in early 2017 with a plan to record them during the Holy Year associated with the Bicentenary of the Birth of Baha’u’llah in 1817. Providence intervened and the Hamilton Baha’i Community invited me to provide a couple of songs for their Bicentenary Celebration called, “What If?”. Clark and Mary Darling Donnelly had written a play that was to be performed for the event and had asked the Toronto acapella group called Countermeasure to perform at the event. I had previously worked with their composer/musical director and arranger, Aaron Jensen, in a group called Cadence, so it was a happy reunion and a great pleasure to work with J-M and such a musical group of talented singers. Aaron wrote beautiful arrangements of the two songs, a reggae-inspired title song called, “What If?, and one of the Feast Songs called, “The Feast of Glory”. The singers were amazing and it seemed like a great fit to work together on these recordings.</p><p><a href=""https://www.countermeasuremusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Visit Countermeasure's Site Here</a></p><p>We had such a great experience working together that we decided to work together to record the Feasts and Holy Days Songbook with Countermeasure for release in the Fall of 2018 during the Bicentenary of Baha’u’llah’s Birth and the Holy Year.</p><p>We’ve made a very good beginning and have recorded several of the Feasts and Holy Days songs and plan on being finished all the work by the Fall of 2018. Stay tuned, I mean really, stay tuned as the pitch and phrasing and musical excellence are a joy to hear.</p><p>We will be releasing all the songs, both as digital downloads and physical product (CDs) as well as a complete songbook of all the music and lyrics as well as choral arrangements of all the songs before the end of October/2018.</p><p>               </p><h3>Parliament of the World’s Religions   </h3><p>The Parliament of the World’s Religions will be celebrated in Toronto this year from November 1st to 8th and I have been asked to be the Musical Director of the Parliament.

The tour is very important to me because it’s my first U.S. Tour, which is expanding my music to listeners outside of Canada and into the U.S.A.</p><p>Since a workplace injury in 2009, I have chosen to empower people through my physical struggle, and show others how important it is to never give up and always keep following your dreams!</p><p>My approach: is to help people reach their dreams by inspiring independence, ambition, hard work, hope, love, awareness, and perseverance. You CAN  &amp; WILL live better lives. You know what you are capable of doing, now you've just got to take the steps you need in order to reach your destination! Always keep your best foot forward and never give up! Give it all that you’ve got, keep on running towards what you believe in and you can build yourself a future!! If I can dream big and completely leave behind my old life in pursuit of the new, so can you! ""John Lennon died, for what he believed"" You have a choice, you have a voice, and you can always live out your best life!</p><p> </p><p>My Motto: “See more, hear more, feel more, and BE more!” - Motive Force</p><p> </p><h3><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></u></h3><p>First off, this tour is not completely supported by this campaign. It has taken me 18 months to save and plan this tour in California &amp; Arizona but the extension into Texas and Nashville is a bit heavy on expenses. The $14,447 that I raise is for some costs that currently remain uncovered. ALL of the money will go directly towards the necessary services that are needed to complete this tour (Budget is posted below). I always negotiate to get the best prices and I make every dollar go as far as I possibly can. Each contribution you make directly allows me to continue to create top-notch music for you - the listeners!</p><h3><u>HERE’S THE BUDGET: Where the money is going</u></h3><p>Gas = $2276</p><p>Airplanes = $1012 (3 Planes)</p><p>Vehicle rental = $3212</p><p>Busses = $749</p><p>Taxies = $623</p><p>Accommodations (Hotel &amp; Air BnB) = $5491</p><p>Marketing = $1084</p><p><u><strong>TOTAL COST = $14,447</strong></u></p><p>Note: I have not included my food and other necessities in this budget.

The tour is very important to me because it’s my first U.S. Tour, which is expanding my music to listeners outside of Canada and into the U.S.A.Since a workplace injury in 2009, I have chosen to empower people through my physical struggle, and show others how important it is to never give up and always keep following your dreams!My approach: is to help people reach their dreams by inspiring independence, ambition, hard work, hope, love, awareness, and perseverance. You CAN  & WILL live better lives. You know what you are capable of doing, now you've just got to take the steps you need in order to reach your destination! Always keep your best foot forward and never give up! Give it all that you’ve got, keep on running towards what you believe in and you can build yourself a future!! If I can dream big and completely leave behind my old life in pursuit of the new, so can you! ""John Lennon died, for what he believed"" You have a choice, you have a voice, and you can always live out your best life! My Motto: “See more, hear more, feel more, and BE more!” - Motive Force What We Need & What You Get:First off, this tour is not completely supported by this campaign. It has taken me 18 months to save and plan this tour in California & Arizona but the extension into Texas and Nashville is a bit heavy on expenses. The $14,447 that I raise is for some costs that currently remain uncovered. ALL of the money will go directly towards the necessary services that are needed to complete this tour (Budget is posted below). I always negotiate to get the best prices and I make every dollar go as far as I possibly can. Each contribution you make directly allows me to continue to create top-notch music for you - the listeners!HERE’S THE BUDGET: Where the money is goingGas = $2276Airplanes = $1012 (3 Planes)Vehicle rental = $3212Busses = $749Taxies = $623Accommodations (Hotel & Air BnB) = $5491Marketing = $1084TOTAL COST = $14,447Note: I have not included my food and other necessities in this budget. All the other expenses are coming out of my own pocket.I am a very translucent type person when it comes to honesty and communication, so the final tour budget will be posted upon completion of the tour in April. THE PERKS: What you get!- You get the assurance that you helped a reputable musician with a track record make dreams come true and that you helped others become inspired to reach goals - That alone is priceless.- Community - You also get to belong to a growing community of like-minded inspiring people.

<h3> The Journey &amp; The Impact</h3>
<p>I appreciate everyone who's has been a part of this journey and those of you who are just joining now! The reception of Polka Dot Shoes and Fade To Blue has been overwhelmingly positive and both are gaining some good momentum. For those of you who don't know, they are the two singles we have recorded for the album so far.</p>

<p> <a href=""https://songwhip.com/album/mercury-slim/polka-dot-shoes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://songwhip.com/album/mercury-slim/polka-d...</a></p>
<p>When we began recording the songs last year, It was a mixture of me working as much as possible to pull together the money to record, and then getting into the studio whenever Jon was free. At the rate we're going now, it would take two more years for us to finish this album. So we've decided to let the people choose whether it gets here in over a 2 years time or whether it can be here as early as this summer!</p>
<p>The songs for this album have been written over the past couple of years, and are based on my experiences here in LA of love, loss, economic hardship, disdain for the current political climate and culture. Putting your self in someone else's shoes. About embracing my inner masculinity and femininity. It's about trying to navigate the world within and also letting your inner voice out. Ultimately, it's about how no matter what we're going through, we can always rise above.</p>
<p>​The songs are complete and ready to record, but one thing I've learned here in the City of Angels, is that I can't go it alone. Jon and I are prepared to knock the album out as early as this summer. This is where I need your help! By contributing to the campaign and joining our team, I know that  all together, we can lift this project up. All together we can get these Mercury Slim songs out to the world.</p>

<strong>IMAGINE.. A revival sweeping the country, radically impacting drug addicts and bringing the hope of Jesus to the hurting and struggling.</strong><br/> </h3><p>Hi! My name is Allan. 18 years ago I was an incarcerated drug addict. It was then that God set me free and gave me hope and a future. Today, Allan Scott Band shares the love of Jesus with many who are struggling and addicted in drug rehabs, prisons &amp; churches across the country. Two years ago, 225 of you helped us record an album of songs. Over the past few years, those songs have been used at  270 events (including 28 state penitentiaries) to share Jesus with thousands of hurting people. And this year, in the midst of all the uncertainty and chaos sweeping the nation, God has given us the desire to create <u><strong>a national tour specifically for the addicted, hurting and struggling.</strong></u> This will undoubtedly be the biggest undertaking that we have ever attempted. But we believe that now more than ever, people need to experience the hope that Jesus gives. </p><p>With that in mind, starting in the Spring of 2021 and continuing for as many years as God allows, ‘<strong>The Story Tour</strong>’ will be held in churches, community centers, prisons, and rehabs across the country. Each event will be a one-night musical journey featuring the hopeful original music of ASB, live speakers, powerful testimonies &amp; teaching, times of ministry and God stories from across the USA. Stories of freedom from addiction, depression and eating disorders. Stories of amazing healings and restored marriages. All designed to communicate one idea: <i><u>with Jesus, your story isn’t over!</u></i>  We believe this will be a powerful and unique experience for those who are hurting and addicted.  <strong>It is our goal that this event will be able to tour for years into the future, as long as there is a need.</strong></p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mj71hlt6y4M?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><p>And we can’t do it without you! This will be a ticketed event with ticket prices kept intentionally low. Large groups of tickets will be given away to those in drug rehabs and to those who can’t afford them but want to come. We will also bring the event free of charge to Penitentiaries. We estimate the cost to develop and launch the tour will be around $80,000, half of which we hope to raise through this campaign. Would you please consider supporting this project? When you do, you will be the hands and feet of Jesus in the lives of those who may be addicted, hurting or incarcerated. Thank you!</p><p><br/><b>Below: Hear how Brenna was impacted at one of our penitentiary events:</b></p><div>

<br/><strong>Goal</strong>

<br/><strong>Will COVID Prevent Spring Events?</strong>
</h3><p>We currently have an estimated 17 events scheduled for the spring. In addition, we will be booking 10 events in penitentiaries. If COVID prevents these spring events, they will be moved to the Fall of 2021. We believe that ‘The Story Tour’ is something that God has called us to do.

A revival sweeping the country, radically impacting drug addicts and bringing the hope of Jesus to the hurting and struggling. Hi! My name is Allan. 18 years ago I was an incarcerated drug addict. It was then that God set me free and gave me hope and a future. Today, Allan Scott Band shares the love of Jesus with many who are struggling and addicted in drug rehabs, prisons & churches across the country. Two years ago, 225 of you helped us record an album of songs. Over the past few years, those songs have been used at  270 events (including 28 state penitentiaries) to share Jesus with thousands of hurting people. And this year, in the midst of all the uncertainty and chaos sweeping the nation, God has given us the desire to create a national tour specifically for the addicted, hurting and struggling. This will undoubtedly be the biggest undertaking that we have ever attempted. But we believe that now more than ever, people need to experience the hope that Jesus gives. With that in mind, starting in the Spring of 2021 and continuing for as many years as God allows, ‘The Story Tour’ will be held in churches, community centers, prisons, and rehabs across the country. Each event will be a one-night musical journey featuring the hopeful original music of ASB, live speakers, powerful testimonies & teaching, times of ministry and God stories from across the USA. Stories of freedom from addiction, depression and eating disorders. Stories of amazing healings and restored marriages. All designed to communicate one idea: with Jesus, your story isn’t over!  We believe this will be a powerful and unique experience for those who are hurting and addicted.  It is our goal that this event will be able to tour for years into the future, as long as there is a need. And we can’t do it without you! This will be a ticketed event with ticket prices kept intentionally low. Large groups of tickets will be given away to those in drug rehabs and to those who can’t afford them but want to come. We will also bring the event free of charge to Penitentiaries. We estimate the cost to develop and launch the tour will be around $80,000, half of which we hope to raise through this campaign. Would you please consider supporting this project? When you do, you will be the hands and feet of Jesus in the lives of those who may be addicted, hurting or incarcerated. Thank you!Below: Hear how Brenna was impacted at one of our penitentiary events:

Goal
It is our goal to raise $40,000 though this campaign which will help cover the costs of: Penitentiary EventsFree Tickets To Those In NeedKeeping Ticket Prices LowPromotionsTravel ExpensesVideo WorkLighting Perks/Incentives Indiegogo Fees
Will COVID Prevent Spring Events?
We currently have an estimated 17 events scheduled for the spring. In addition, we will be booking 10 events in penitentiaries. If COVID prevents these spring events, they will be moved to the Fall of 2021. We believe that ‘The Story Tour’ is something that God has called us to do.

<h3>ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>The app is going to be a free-to-play, colorful music training game. The goal is to tap the correct notes displayed on your screen while the in-game character is dodging obstacles and advancing higher to each stage! There will be items, different character selections, upgrades and fun boss battles included as well. Player scores will be on display on the in-app leaderboard and the highest scoring players will get tons of rewards and merch in and outside of the game! In order to create the highest quality product (along with the app development) I've invested a lot of time and attention to detail into making sure every level of the music course was very well thought-out and presented in the clearest way possible. In order to run the website and develop the app, this has taken a good amount of funding and requires a team of professionals to fully bring this idea to life! Because of this, I've started a campaign that would go 100% into the development of these products and into building the best possible team to make it happen! Thank you for being on this journey with me!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>   Hey everyone! My name is Lawrence Pennington. You probably know me by my artist name, Bear Witness. I'm launching this campaign to help fund my dream of creating a conscious movement via dope music and lyrical content.</p>
<p>   For those of you who don't know who I am, you can find my music on all of your favorite streaming platforms by searching ""Bear Witness"".</p>
<p>   Ever since I was a kid, I've always wanted to be a musician. Not only to tell my story but to make an impact on the world. It wasn't until about 6 years ago that I decided to really pursue music. I hopped into the studio in 2014 and released my first singles, ""The World is a Playground"" and ""Permeate the Air"". Music videos for those singles shortly followed, and I gained a following almost overnight. It's been quite a journey so far, and I'm so grateful for all of the love and support I get from all of my wonderful fans out there.</p>
<p>   After years of getting the runaround from different labels and investors and shelling out massive amounts of money for studio time, I decided I was going to go fully independent. Build my own recording studio and start my own record label. And so, Permeate Records was born.</p>
<p>   As the founder and very first artist under Permeate Records, my goal is to take it all the way to the top in order to reach the ears of the masses. I've created this label not only for my own music but so that I can bring other conscious artists on the journey and give them the opportunity to have the platform that they deserve. </p>
<p>   Recently I quit my day job and decided that I'm going to go at this full time. I've got all of the tools and skills necessary to succeed at making this dream a reality. There's just one thing I'm really lacking: Adequate funding. And that's where, hopefully, you can help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm hoping to raise around $50,000 or more to really give this movement a push. We need funds for things like more equipment, touring, merchandise, music videos, marketing campaigns, playlist placing, features with big artists, etc.</li>
<li>I just want to be clear that I'm not asking for any handouts. Each donor will get perks like access to exclusive content and merchandise before it reaches the public, as well as other incentives according to donation tier. Be sure to click on the perks to check out what you get for your donation.</li>
<li>If for some reason we don't hit out goal, that's okay. With Indiegogo, we don't have to reach the goal to get the funds. Any funds raised will still help the label get where it needs to go and ease the burden of taking on this financial challenge on my own. However, I'm fairly confident that our goal will be reached. And if we surpass it, even better.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>I had made the realization many years ago that lyrical music, particularly hip-hop, has the biggest influence on the youth of the future generations. The kids want to do what the rappers do. Instead of glorifying things like violence, materialism, and negativity, let's give the people something that will uplift them. Expand their consciousness. Help them find happiness. Encourage them to have fun and most importantly: Be themselves.</li>
<li>A lot of you have heard my music, some of you may have not. Before donating, I encourage you to check it out and feel the vibe.  Get to know what Bear Witness is about. Throughout the years, I have grown both as a person and as an artist. I am committed to using my platform with good intentions in order to aid in spreading awareness of things like civil injustice, mental health issues and social struggles and to encourage concepts like authenticity, unconditional love and open communication.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ask any independent artist out there. Dedicating yourself to any project, especially art, comes with ups and downs and always has room for failure. However, I have full confidence that with your help as a community, Permeate can become one of the most successful record labels in history</li>
<li>Despite what challenges may get thrown our way, we will take every precaution necessary to avoid them. We will overcome all obstacles and live out the intended goal of success. Each backer will be subscribed to an email list to get updates along the way so that you can see our progress and how your donation is being spent</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>I understand that times aren't the best for everyone financially. Some people are thriving while others are struggling. If you can't donate, that's completely okay. You can help by sharing this campaign and by liking and following ""Permeate Records"" on Facebook at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/permeaterecords"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/permeaterecords</a>

<h3>HI EVERYONE!</h3>
<p>My name is Kileza, I'm an indie r&amp;b singer songwriter. I've spent the last few years as a musical nomad, singing and playing across Europe. Some of the highlights of my career include singing at the Classic Open Air in Berlin, Gigging with Boney M, and singing for the German President.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, I'm making an album! Songs about my experiences in the cities I've lived in; and the love and loss that comes with that. I'll be also touching on my upbringing in South Africa and how that challenged the things I come across on this side of the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Helping me to achieve this will send me to the moon and back! I'd be delighted to able to make the music the very best it can be. </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</div></div>","HI EVERYONE!
My name is Kileza, I'm an indie r&b singer songwriter. I've spent the last few years as a musical nomad, singing and playing across Europe. Some of the highlights of my career include singing at the Classic Open Air in Berlin, Gigging with Boney M, and singing for the German President.
 
Now, I'm making an album! Songs about my experiences in the cities I've lived in; and the love and loss that comes with that. I'll be also touching on my upbringing in South Africa and how that challenged the things I come across on this side of the world. 
 
Helping me to achieve this will send me to the moon and back! I'd be delighted to able to make the music the very best it can be.

Please watch and enjoy. I originally wrote this song to show my dad how much I appreciate his service to our country. Every time I play it, the response is extremely positive and incredibly humbling. I now realize that I need to share it with every veteran that I can, to let them know that there are many of us who appreciate them and the sacrifices that they make. All of the donations will be used to get me to Nashville and pay for expenses including studio time and musicians. I want to thank you all for your support and encouragement.Even if you can't help this project financially, please continue to support and pray for our troops!Sincerely, Steven W. SmithWelcome

""A young man in a uniform coming home
from a foreign war
Never really knowing why or what he was
fighting for
Just standing up for freedom and his
country on a cold and distant shore
As he walks off of the airplane into
this busy place
A pretty little hippie girl with blond
hair full of grace
Comes up like she's gonna hug him, then
yells ""Baby Killer!!!"" & spits right in his face
That's the story my Daddy tells 'bout
his return from Vietnam
No ticker-tape parades no welcome home
or shaking hands
Just shamed and forgotten by his
country like no one gave a damn
Even as a young boy I knew that
was wrong
All these unsung heroes were just
trying to get along
And it's about time someone spoke up
for them all and gave them all a song



Cause there are Heroes Among Us
People you may know
They heard the call of freedom and they
chose to go
There are Heroes Among Us
Faces old and new
They lay down their lives for me and
you
So wherever you may see them, wherever
you may roam
It's about time we said ""Thank you
for your Service!"" & ""Welcome Home!""


A Father and a Mother a Husband and a
Wife

Brothers, Sisters, Sons and Daughters
all with Families and Lives

But they all put on that uniform and
make that sacrifice

Wherever there is trouble that
threatens Liberty

Whether right here in our neighborhoods
or far across the sea

You can bet they're right there giving
all they've got to fight to keep us free




Cause they are Heroes Among Us
People you may know
They heard the call of freedom and they
chose to go
They are Heroes Among Us
Spirits tried and true
They lay down their lives for me and
you
So wherever you may see them, wherever
you may roam
It's about time we said ""Thank you
for your Service!"" & ""Welcome Home!""


I know that we salute them on Memorial
and Veteran's Days
I've seen them when they're marching in
the 4th of July Parade
But there's 362 other days in the year
for our thanks to be displayed


(INSTRUMENTAL BREAK)


So if you've ever worn the uniform
stand up proud and tall

We're glad that you were there when our
backs were against the wall

And we want you to know that we salute
you and appreciate you all


Cause you are Heroes Among Us
Now you know we know
That you heard the call of freedom and
you chose to go
You are Heroes Among Us
For Red White & Blue
You lay down your lives just doing what
you do
So wherever we may see you, wherever
you may roam
It's about time we said ""Thank you
for your Service!"" & ""Welcome Home!""
""Welcome Home!""
We Thank God For You!

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The Music Business is a business of emotions. It's one of the only businesses that transcends every other corporate structure because it's not only about money, it's about emotion. Its about the listener feeling good and delivering music that can evoke those feelings. Music is there for you during good times, hard times, laughter, sadness and love. It goes with you throughout all the days of your life. Have you ever asked yourself what your life would be like if music didn't exist? It would be a boring world. From the beginning of time, if musicians didn't push to get their music heard, that is what could have very well happened. We'd be living in a boring world, a soundless wasteland! So if you like this song, contribute and help bring something fresh, encouraging and exciting to the masses!! TESSA is a voice to be heard, so let's make her the PEOPLES CHOICE!!</p>

I invite you to get to know this school better, and to meet a few of the students you will be helping - their profiles are available at www.schoolsupporters.org.    What We Need & What You Get This year we want to start small. With a goal of six thousand dollars, which  converts to twenty two thousand zloty in Polish currency, we aim to supply a small school in Nowa Wieś with instruments for their music groups and music room. 
A band setup for a school this size costs approximately $10,000 dollars. School Supporters is aiming to supply the school with 50% of the funds, and the Parent Teacher Association at the school will raise the other 50%. 
    
WHO ARE WE HELPING?


A small public school in Nowa Wieś, Poland and the music program that they wish to expand. This school has roughly 330 students in all.    
Other Ways You Can Help

 
We are accepting useable instruments in good condition. We are also accepting sellable items that we will display on our website. All profits collected from the items sold will go to funding this school's music program.For more information about this alternative way to help, please check out our website at www.schoolsupporters.org",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>My name is Justin
St-Pierre, I am a Quebec fingerstyle guitarist and composer who has two albums
to his credit: <i>Rafiot</i> (2008), and <i>La Faille</i> (2011). In addition to touring
regularly, I’ve won several music competitions, including the prestigious
international competition of the Canadian Guitar Festival in 2013.</p>
<p>I am now ready to record
my third album, <i>L’insulaire</i>, a French
word which means “the islander”, and so I am seeking your support in this, my
very first Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>The pieces on this album
were inspired by the urban soundscapes of the island of Montreal, the rumblings
of the city, the boisterous buzz of its inhabitants. It expresses the elation,
the joy, but also the solitude I felt, all filtered through the prism of a
rapturous six-string mantra.</p>
<p>While my previous albums
were self-financed, this time I feel compelled to let you in on the production
of this collection of works which span four years of composition. Your contribution
will push my career forward, and help me take it to the ends of the earth! Let
me explain.</p>
<p>Once the recording of <i>L’insulaire</i> is completed, I will embark
on a tour of the Southern Hemisphere that will kick off in New Caledonia, a
country that I had the pleasure of discovering this year thanks to my brother
Marc, who was working there. It is on this small French island of the South
Pacific, nestled between Australia and New Zealand, that I put the finishing
touches to the acoustic guitar pieces you will find on this album.</p>
<p><i>L’insulaire</i>,
The Islander... This title now seems strangely appropriate considering the
project’s first notes resonated on one island, that of Montreal, but found
their ultimate inspiration straight across the world on another.</p>
<p>This remote part of the
world opened up to me, opened my eyes and my heart like no place before it,
safe from my native Abitibi. It put colour back into my life at a time when all
had gone grey, lifted me and gave new breath to my musical vision. I am now ready
to share this wonderful adventure with you.</p>
<p>Again this time, I have
an incredible team to help me out:</p>
<p><i>L’insulaire</i>
will be engineered and produced by JJ Coolidge, who also did production duties
on Erik Mongrain’s third album, <i>Forward</i>.</p>
<p>The sleeve and artwork
of the album will be created by my dear friend, the graphic artist Geneviève
Baril.</p>
<p>My cherished accomplice,
Léa Deborde, is taking care of the logistics for the Pacific Tour. She is also
my official photographer, as well as the designer of the website ( <a href=""http://www.justinst-pierre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.justinst-pierre.com</a> ) </p>
<p>No doubt, life is full
of surprises. And it has a way of putting the right people across our path.</p>
<p><b>Feel like helping me see this project to fruition? Thank
you. Hope you enjoy the ride!</b></p>
<p></p>
<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Here’s a sample of a
piece called <i>Promontoire</i> (Promontory), recorded by JJ in preproduction. It’s shaping up to be one of the
album’s high points:</span></h2>
<p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/justinstpierre/promontoire-excerpt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/justinstpierre/promontoire-excerpt</a></p>
<p><b>The funds collected on this campaign will finance recording,
mastering, graphic design, and CD duplication. They will also enable me to
produce promo videos, as well as help me reach the South Pacific!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>If this campaign exceeds
its target goal (which, frankly, would totally blow me away!!), <b>I’ll use the additional funds to record a
collection of cover songs</b>. The fans who have followed my career and seen me
live have often told me how they would love to hear me sing on an album. What a
thrill it would be for me to grant them this wish!</p>
<p><i>L’insulaire</i>
will be recorded this summer. The Pacific Tour is set to start in October, with
projected dates in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and Japan. After that, who
knows? We’ll see where the wind takes us!</p>
<p>As a Justin St-Pierre
contributor, you will get regular updates during the recording. I definitely
want you to know how things are going! You will also have exclusive access to
videos of me playing excerpts of my new compositions.</p>
<p>My new guitar, “The
Arrow”, will undoubtedly be the heart and soul of <i>L’insulaire</i>. Built by one of the greatest luthiers of our time,
Sheldon Schwartz, this exceptional instrument will make my music soar like
never before.</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to share
this project on Facebook, Twitter, and on other social media.</p>
<p>And tell your friends!
Word-of-mouth is still the best form of communication.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time,
for your support, and for helping me take my career and my artistic vision to a
higher plane.</p>
<p>For this, I will be
forever grateful.</p>
<br/>

Je me nomme Justin St-Pierre et je suis un guitariste acoustique contemporain québecois, adepte du ""fingerstyle"". En plus des deux albums que j'ai à mon actif - Rafiot (2008); La Faille (2011) - j'ai remporté plusieurs concours de musique, dont la compétition internationale du Canadian Guitar Festival en 2013. 



Je lance ici ma première campagne Indiegogo, ceci dans le but de produire mon troisième opus: L'insulaire. 
Cet album sera principalement inspiré des bruits ambiants de l'île de Montréal, du ""ôm"" de la cité, de la rumeur des passants. Ce sera la ville dans toute son enivrance et sa solitude, interprétée à travers un univers acoustique envoûtant.









Bien que j'ai toujours financé moi-même mes albums par le passé, cette fois je sollicite votre appui afin de produire cet ouvrage qui représente quatre années de composition. En participant à cette campagne, vous contribuerez à la continuité de ma carrière... mais vous m'aiderez aussi à la porter à l'autre bout du monde!
Ce nouvel album sera en effet suivi d'une tournée de l'hémisphère austral qui débutera en Nouvelle-Calédonie, une petite île française nichée entre l'Australie et la Nouvelle-Zélande que j'ai découverte cette année grâce à mon frère Marc, qui travaillait là-bas. C'est là que j'ai achevé de composer les pièces de L'insulaire. 

L'insulaire... Curieux que j'ai choisi ce titre pour désigner une île, celle de Montréal, alors que c'est une île située aux antipodes qui en deviendrait l'ultime inspiration.



Cette lointaine partie du monde s'est ouverte à moi, m'a ouvert les yeux et le coeur comme seule mon Abitibi natale avait su le faire jusque là. Elle m'a redonné goût à la vie à un moment où j'avais envie de baisser les bras. Porté par cette vague, j'entends poursuivre mon aventure artistique en partageant avec vous mes récits et ma vision musicale. 


Encore une fois pour cet album, j'ai su m'entourer d'une merveilleuse équipe : 



Aux commandes de l'enregistrement, mon collègue guitariste JJ Coolidge, réalisateur du très admiré Forward, le troisième album d'Erik Mongrain. 



Ma chère amie, l'artiste graphiste de talent Geneviève Baril, créera la pochette de L'insulaire.




Léa Deborde, ma complice avec qui je prépare en ce moment la tournée du Pacifique, mais qui est aussi ma photographe ainsi que la conceptrice du site Internet ( www.justinst-pierre.com ) 


Oui, la vie est remplie de surprises. Et souvent elle sait placer les bonnes personnes sur notre route.


Vous avez envie de m'aider à concrétiser ce projet? Merci, et bienvenue dans cette belle aventure!



Voici un extrait réalisé en préproduction de Promontoire, qui sera selon moi une des pièces maîtresses de l'album :

Les fonds amassés lors de cette campagne serviront à défrayer les coûts d'enregistrement, de mastering, de graphisme et de duplication de l'album. Ils serviront aussi à réaliser des vidéos promotionelles et à financer mon départ pour le Pacifique Sud!






Si cette campagne dépasse l'objectif fixé (ce qui me ferait carrément halluciner!!), j'utiliserai les fonds supplémentaires pour enregistrer un album de reprises. Les fans qui m'ont vu en spectacle et qui suivent ma carrière depuis des années m'ont souvent dit qu'ils aimeraient entendre ma voix sur disque. Quel plaisir ce serait pour moi d'exaucer ce voeu en leur offrant un album de chansons!






L'insulaire sera produit au cours de l'été 2015. Le départ pour le ""Pacific Tour"" est prévu pour octobre 2015, les destinations visées étant l'Australie, la Nouvelle-Zélande, la Thaïlande et le Japon. Et après? Qui sait? Tout est possible!
Toutes les personnes qui contribueront à cette campagne seront tenues informées du déroulement de l'enregistrement, et elles auront aussi accès à des extraits vidéo de mes nouvelles compositions. 

L'âme de cet album sera sans contredit ma nouvelle guitare, ''The Arrow'', un instrument exceptionnel fabriqué par un des plus grands luthiers de notre époque, Sheldon Schwartz. Cette guitare fera résonner ma musique comme jamais. 




N'hésitez pas à partager ce projet sur Facebook, Twitter et sur les autres réseaux sociaux. 
Et parlez-en à vos amis, parce que le bouche à oreille, ça fonctionne!

Merci de votre attention, de vos encouragements et de votre désir d'embarquer dans cette aventure qui représente la continuité de ma carrière. 

Je vous en serai à jamais reconnaissant.

Hi there,
My name is Justin
St-Pierre, I am a Quebec fingerstyle guitarist and composer who has two albums
to his credit: Rafiot (2008), and La Faille (2011). In addition to touring
regularly, I’ve won several music competitions, including the prestigious
international competition of the Canadian Guitar Festival in 2013.
I am now ready to record
my third album, L’insulaire, a French
word which means “the islander”, and so I am seeking your support in this, my
very first Indiegogo campaign.
The pieces on this album
were inspired by the urban soundscapes of the island of Montreal, the rumblings
of the city, the boisterous buzz of its inhabitants. It expresses the elation,
the joy, but also the solitude I felt, all filtered through the prism of a
rapturous six-string mantra.
While my previous albums
were self-financed, this time I feel compelled to let you in on the production
of this collection of works which span four years of composition. Your contribution
will push my career forward, and help me take it to the ends of the earth! Let
me explain.
Once the recording of L’insulaire is completed, I will embark
on a tour of the Southern Hemisphere that will kick off in New Caledonia, a
country that I had the pleasure of discovering this year thanks to my brother
Marc, who was working there. It is on this small French island of the South
Pacific, nestled between Australia and New Zealand, that I put the finishing
touches to the acoustic guitar pieces you will find on this album.
L’insulaire,
The Islander... This title now seems strangely appropriate considering the
project’s first notes resonated on one island, that of Montreal, but found
their ultimate inspiration straight across the world on another.
This remote part of the
world opened up to me, opened my eyes and my heart like no place before it,
safe from my native Abitibi. It put colour back into my life at a time when all
had gone grey, lifted me and gave new breath to my musical vision. I am now ready
to share this wonderful adventure with you.
Again this time, I have
an incredible team to help me out:
L’insulaire
will be engineered and produced by JJ Coolidge, who also did production duties
on Erik Mongrain’s third album, Forward.
The sleeve and artwork
of the album will be created by my dear friend, the graphic artist Geneviève
Baril.
My cherished accomplice,
Léa Deborde, is taking care of the logistics for the Pacific Tour. She is also
my official photographer, as well as the designer of the website ( www.justinst-pierre.com ) 
No doubt, life is full
of surprises. And it has a way of putting the right people across our path.
Feel like helping me see this project to fruition? Thank
you. Hope you enjoy the ride!

Here’s a sample of a
piece called Promontoire (Promontory), recorded by JJ in preproduction. It’s shaping up to be one of the
album’s high points:
https://soundcloud.com/justinstpierre/promontoire-excerpt
The funds collected on this campaign will finance recording,
mastering, graphic design, and CD duplication. They will also enable me to
produce promo videos, as well as help me reach the South Pacific!

If this campaign exceeds
its target goal (which, frankly, would totally blow me away!!), I’ll use the additional funds to record a
collection of cover songs. The fans who have followed my career and seen me
live have often told me how they would love to hear me sing on an album. What a
thrill it would be for me to grant them this wish!
L’insulaire
will be recorded this summer. The Pacific Tour is set to start in October, with
projected dates in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and Japan. After that, who
knows? We’ll see where the wind takes us!
As a Justin St-Pierre
contributor, you will get regular updates during the recording. I definitely
want you to know how things are going! You will also have exclusive access to
videos of me playing excerpts of my new compositions.
My new guitar, “The
Arrow”, will undoubtedly be the heart and soul of L’insulaire. Built by one of the greatest luthiers of our time,
Sheldon Schwartz, this exceptional instrument will make my music soar like
never before.
Don’t hesitate to share
this project on Facebook, Twitter, and on other social media.
And tell your friends!
Word-of-mouth is still the best form of communication.
Thank you for your time,
for your support, and for helping me take my career and my artistic vision to a
higher plane.
For this, I will be
forever grateful.

</h3> <p></p>
<p>Each culture and community has its own stories. 
Through telling these stories, we build bridges between communities 
based on the understanding we share. In performing these two chamber operas on 
Indian themes, Festival Opera hopes to bring the unique cultural 
experience of the Indian community to those outside it, connecting the 
wide variety of cultures and communities in the Bay Area via opera.</p>
<div>The double bill: Gustav Holst's <i>Savitri</i> and Jack Perla and Chitra Divakaruni's <i>River of Light</i>,
 provides two different insights into Indian culture, the former being based on the episode of Savitri and Satyavan from the <i>Mahabharata</i>, a Sanskrit epic of ancient India and the latter being a contemporary 
look into what it means to be an assimilated American yet still desire 
to maintain ties with your cultural and family heritage. The vision for presenting these works highlights how opera as a genre can not only link cultures, but also tell stories that are timeless and relevant.<br/><br/><h3>Who We Are<br/>
</h3>Now in our third decade, Festival Opera remains committed to bringing 
professional opera productions at affordable prices to residents of San 
Francisco's East Bay communities. The third-largest opera company in the
 Bay Area, Festival Opera is a showcase for talented young artists and 
directors.<br/><p></p>
</div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Where Is The Money Going?<br/>
</h3>The money earned from this campaign will be used to pay the cast, musicians, and artistic team for their contributions. This includes the singers, traditional Indian dancers, and orchestra members who dedicate a majority of their time to learning and performing the music as well as the director and designers for translating what is on paper to the stage. Grants, ticket revenue and individual donations to date reveal a shortfall that we hope to fill with this campaign. If you believe in the importance of telling unique, culturally-relevant stories, won't you please contribute?<br/><br/><h3>Perks <br/>
</h3>All donations made are tax-deductible, and an acknowledgement letter will be sent.

</div></div>","Why Is This Important?
 
Each culture and community has its own stories. 
Through telling these stories, we build bridges between communities 
based on the understanding we share. In performing these two chamber operas on 
Indian themes, Festival Opera hopes to bring the unique cultural 
experience of the Indian community to those outside it, connecting the 
wide variety of cultures and communities in the Bay Area via opera.
The double bill: Gustav Holst's Savitri and Jack Perla and Chitra Divakaruni's River of Light,
 provides two different insights into Indian culture, the former being based on the episode of Savitri and Satyavan from the Mahabharata, a Sanskrit epic of ancient India and the latter being a contemporary 
look into what it means to be an assimilated American yet still desire 
to maintain ties with your cultural and family heritage. The vision for presenting these works highlights how opera as a genre can not only link cultures, but also tell stories that are timeless and relevant.Who We Are
Now in our third decade, Festival Opera remains committed to bringing 
professional opera productions at affordable prices to residents of San 
Francisco's East Bay communities. The third-largest opera company in the
 Bay Area, Festival Opera is a showcase for talented young artists and 
directors.

   Where Is The Money Going?
The money earned from this campaign will be used to pay the cast, musicians, and artistic team for their contributions. This includes the singers, traditional Indian dancers, and orchestra members who dedicate a majority of their time to learning and performing the music as well as the director and designers for translating what is on paper to the stage. Grants, ticket revenue and individual donations to date reveal a shortfall that we hope to fill with this campaign. If you believe in the importance of telling unique, culturally-relevant stories, won't you please contribute?Perks

<h3>Let's Imagine</h3>
<p>When we first started playing together last summer, we planned to make an album so that our kids would have an easy way to remember and enjoy the songs we made up when they were little. But after <a href=""https://louisdaninvisibleband.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the album</a> came out, song ideas just kept coming to us, and more and more people seemed to be enjoying our music all around the world, from Minneapolis to Australia.</p>
<p>Now we have more than 25 new songs, and we want to share at least a dozen on a second album - but we need your help. Recording music is expensive, and Dan's 40th birthday (for which he gifted himself our last recording studio session) only comes once every few years. We need your help to get back in the studio and produce a second album, one that isn't just for our kids, but for you and your kids, too.</p>
<p>We're calling the second album ""Let's Imagine"" after a song we wrote (and not after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zX_dI_vBKo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alfonzo Blackwell's similarly titled, soft-jazz album</a>), but we think it's a good way to describe what we do in general. We use music to inspire our listeners' imaginations, and to inspire our own imaginations. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're planning to start recording in a home studio this summer, which will save us some money. But to finish recording in a studio - and to pay to get the album professionally mixed and mastered, not to mention album art, and CD printing - we need your support. If the first album was any indication, the second album will cost a bit more than $6,000. We're hoping all of our friends, family, and fans will pitch in by the end of the summer so we can get this album recorded, produced, and out by early December - just in time for the holidays!</p>
<p>If you were likely to buy a CD or <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/3Ox1OWC966F2VscYApGxmn?si=5-PL9R9oQ4idrCzybynyMg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">listen to us on Spotify</a>, then we're just asking you to pitch in sooner rather than later. And there are so many other great rewards to get on top of a digital download or CD. You can get a sheet of limited edition stickers and t-shirts designed by the fabulous David Huyck, a live, command performance of one of our songs via Facetime or Skype, a personalized voicemail greeting (like <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/user-393335312/bonnie-voicemail/s-uaIg0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this one</a> or <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/user-393335312/dh-voicemail/s-l4eqw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this one</a>), a ringtone, a fresh song on a topic of your choice - and you can schedule a private house concert!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>Home studio recording is slated to start during the last week of July, but we can only record certain parts on our personal equipment. To handle the rest, if we raise enough money by the beginning of August, we'll head to <a href=""https://www.thelibraryrecordingstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Library</a> - where we recorded <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/6NtRoW4iBMLfU8lhKAdRB2?si=n1rv5pwxTduzzFa0OknI9A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">album #1</a>. There, we'll make use of recording engineer Matt Patrick's extensive library of musical instruments (Hammond organ, three different accordions, industrial-sized glockenspiel, a panoply of hand percussion), and we'll bring in a few musical guests to record cameos, including Ken Pierce of ""Hot Dog"" fame.</p>
<p>If all goes according to schedule and if you pre-ordered an album through this campaign, you'll receive your digital download or physical CD by early December. Stickers and t-shirts will arrive with your CD. And if you commission a performance, a voicemail greeting, ringtone, or song, or book a house concert, we'll be in touch about scheduling.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you choose not to take advantage of the opportunity to snag an advance copy of the second album or claim any of the awesome perks we're offering, we hope you'll share this campaign (and <a href=""https://louisdaninvisibleband.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our first album</a>) with anyone you think might enjoy our music. We hope our music is meaningful and enjoyable to parents and kids alike, and nothing would make us happier than to have our songs spread far and wide.</p>

From musical artists, merchants and visual artists, we have helped put them to work through one of our many events and connected them to an audience and network that helps them grow. We have given away hours upon hours of free studio time, graphic designing and time on stages in and out of Chicago.

We feel we have only started on our journey to success in becoming Chicago’s #1 one stop shop for artists and right now is the perfect time to take our efforts to the next level. With your help, we may continue to expand our collective operation in 2020 to bring a bigger and more effective platform for local artists by connecting with networks throughout the states and around the world. Through your donations and effort of our own we can and will reach our goal; to get to Europe, build our network and throw an amazing music and art showcase.</p> <p>To help you help us we will be curating many events throughout Chicago leading up to our show in Europe this May. We will have showcases, battles, open mics, and parties! All of these events will be geared toward funding our trip to Europe. Come out to a few and experience the community oriented music culture that is Ever Evolved! Now, here is where you can help us and make a difference personally. Our events will not be able to cover the costs of our trip entirely, needing to pay event staff, DJ’s, artists, venue and promotional costs. Besides live events, we need your help by donating to our IndieGoGo campaign! And there are many perks and benefits once you decide to help us out!</p> <p>All of us at Ever Evolved would like to thank you for your support over the years and with your continued help in this vision of getting our collective of artists to play in Europe, come to life.</p>

We will have showcases, battles, open mics, and parties! All of these events will be geared toward funding our trip to Europe. Come out to a few and experience the community oriented music culture that is Ever Evolved! Now, here is where you can help us and make a difference personally. Our events will not be able to cover the costs of our trip entirely, needing to pay event staff, DJ’s, artists, venue and promotional costs. Besides live events, we need your help by donating to our IndieGoGo campaign! And there are many perks and benefits once you decide to help us out! All of us at Ever Evolved would like to thank you for your support over the years and with your continued help in this vision of getting our collective of artists to play in Europe, come to life.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Buffalo Jones - Who We Are:</h2>
<p>Hello!  We're Buffalo Jones, an independent alternative rock and roll outfit from Spokane, Washington.  We've been playing here in the Inland Northwest and far beyond for well over a decade now - since 2006, in fact - and our latest adventure will take us to Athens, Georgia. <br/><br/>We released our first album in the fall of 2008, and have put out two subsequent releases, but this one is different.  You see, over the years, we've been fortunate enough to tour with and open for some amazing national acts - guys that we idolized as younger musicians cutting our own teeth.  That list includes bands like Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven, both of which are fronted by David Lowery.  </p>
<p>After developing a friendship with Mr. Lowery and co. on the road, he was gracious enough to offer to produce our next album for us.  As we said in the overview, when that kind of opportunity knocks, you answer the door.</p>
<p>We've set up all of the details and are ready with a whole batch of new material.  Now, all we need is some help to cover the costs.  By pre-ordering or donating even more to this project, you'll get some amazing, one-of-a-kind perks, and you'll help us to record an album with one of our biggest influences.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here are the Perks!</h3>
<p>As we mentioned, we've booked Chase Park Transduction, a studio in Athens, GA for the last two weeks of August.  Chase Park is where bands like REM, Queens of the Stone Age, and Cracker have recorded some of their best albums.  We've also hired Drew Vandenberg, who has engineered on a lot of our favorite records.  Neither of those things is cheap, nor is getting from Spokane, Washington to Athens.  We need a total of $8,000 to cover the cost of transportation and production of the album.   Here are some of the perks we'll be offering those who want to support us with a pre-order or more!</p>
<ul>
<li>For only $20, you'll get a deluxe digital download of the album with demos and other unreleased material.</li>
<li>For only $5 more, you get signed physical CD, and a sticker, too!</li>
<li>At the $50 level, you'll get all of the above plus a T-shirt, and $75 will get you our full digital catalog, and a signed poster.</li>
<li>We've got a bunch of shows this summer.  $100 buys you the right to write the setlist.</li>
<li>For $250, you'll get a private acoustic house-concert from either Jason Johnson, Andy Rumsey, or Brandon Humphreys for as many of your friends as you can cram in your house. $500 will get you the whole band! (100-mile radius from Spokane, WA).</li>
<li>Finally, if you're willing to invest $1000, we'll pull out all of the stops:  A full-band show at your house, yes, but we're not stopping there. Our drummer, Joshua Martin, is a culinary instructor and a hell of a chef.  Prior to the show, he'll cater a gourmet meal for you and nine of your closest friends! (Talk to us for travel radius details)</li>
</ul>
<p>If our total goal is not reached, all proceeds will still go toward paying for the new album.  </p>

<p>Ultrafaux and Hot Club of Baltimore collectively have recorded 6 critically acclaimed albums since 2012  including 34 original songs, featuring over 20 musicians.  We’re gearing up for our 7th and 8th releases, working with some incredible musicians, but we need your help in order to pull it off!</p>
<p>Everyone who donates will get a download.  </p>
<p>Those who donate $100 or more will receive a surprise bonus gift and a CD when we make them.  (For now its just digital downloads.)  </p>
<p>Those who contribute $500 or more will receive honorable mention on the liner notes of both projects.  Thanks for helping us achieve our goal.   </p>
<p>The final product of our efforts will be two albums:</p>
<p><strong>#1. Ultrafaux Ensemble <i>Tangent</i></strong>  A provocative album of my original songs performed by a larger ensemble featuring exceptional musicians I've toured with and met over the years. This won't be your typical album that stays in one musical style. The songs will move freely between styles while remaining rooted in Gypsy Jazz.  Instrumentation includes violin, accordion, clarinet, guitar, bass, mandolin, and oud to create a wide palette of sound for the listener.  </p>
<p><strong>#2. Hot Club of Baltimore</strong> <strong><i>Best of Hot Club</i></strong>  At least 4 new songs recorded by Hot Club of Baltimore featuring vocalist Alexis Tantau and special guest violinist Evan Price and 6 ""Best of"" songs from our past three CDs, all totally remixed and remastered. The recording will feature tight arrangements and a full ensemble of horns, guitars, bass, vocals violin and piano.  I can also tell you we will be recording some very unique songs nobody has ever done in the Gypsy jazz style. </p>
<p><strong>The <u>official pre-release date</u></strong><u> </u>is set for <strong>Charm City Django Jazzfest 2020 on February 21 &amp; 22 </strong>in Baltimore Maryland, followed by an official release date in March with shows all over the world scheduled throughout 2020. Your generous donation allows us to take the first crucial steps toward our goal!  </p>
<p><strong>Players featured</strong> include <strong>Jason Anick</strong> (Boston), <strong>Patrick McAvinue</strong> (Nashville), <strong>Giacomo Smith</strong> (London), <strong>Dallas Vietty</strong> (NYC), <strong>Connor Stewart</strong> (NOLA), <strong>Jonathan Greene</strong> (NY), <strong>Evan Price</strong> (San Francisco) plus other NY and Nashville based players along with Baltimore-based players <strong>Sami Arefin</strong> and <strong>Zach Serleth</strong>.     </p>
<p><strong>The Goal</strong>: To record at least 10 new original compositions and take this music on tour all over the world and to release two quality albums that truly represent the best of what we can do.   </p>
<p>A lot of planning and cost is involved coordinating players from various regions, lining up studio time, mixing, mastering, and creating a PR plan for promotion and touring. I have created a thorough spreadsheet of all the costs involved; everything from studio-time to transportation, production costs, and artist fees.  A lot of the musicians I'm working with really believe in this project already, so having their enthusiasm and encouragement has been HUGE.  </p>
<p>Thanks for checking out this project and considering donating.  Its my best work yet as a musician and I am excited to share it with you!  </p>

<p>BeatMower: Roaring 20s Album</p>
<p>Nat Keefe here. You might know me from the bluegrass outfit Hot Buttered Rum, where I play guitar and sing. For the last couple years I've also been doing solo DJ sets as BeatMower, and just released BeatMower’s premiere singles “Kwishima” and “Universe.” I’m now asking my wider circles to support me in creating BeatMower’s first full length album and music video. </p>
<p>I’m making an original album combining sounds from East &amp; West Africa with the sounds of Bluegrass music. This will continue the adventure BeatMower began last year in Rwanda and Zambia, with a quarantine stopover in Dubai, Shelter-in-Place in San Francisco, and living room dance parties everywhere. </p>
<p>In February-March 2020 I journeyed with Hot Buttered Rum to Rwanda and Zambia. The supporters of an earlier Indiegogo campaign generously provided me with proper recording equipment, and, after performance days with Butter, I collaborated with and recorded several Rwandan and Zambian musicians to create “Kwishima” and “Universe.” </p>
<p>March 2020 was, of course, right when the Covid Pandemic was beginning to turn the world upside down. In Lusaka, Zambia, I decided to end my trip two days early and head home to my wife and small kids. Quite unfortunately, I registered a slight fever before boarding my connecting flight in Dubai. I was urgently whisked away to the tarmac, where an ambulance awaited me. I ended up spending 5 days in a (rather nice) hospital in Dubai, under guard, before a negative Covid test cleared me to leave. </p>
<p>I returned home on March 19, 2020, to a home completely changed. San Francisco on shelter-in-place lockdown! Work and schools closed! Every gig on the horizon canceled. </p>
<p>My impulse was to play music. I began weekly Saturday night shelter-in-place livestream sets, and BeatMower sounds bounced around living room dance parties across the globe. My partner Erin would come hang and dance and we’d connect with friends far away. For us and others, this was bliss after so much time in lockdown. </p>
<p>This year, I’m asking my people to support me in going deeper.  If we can reach full funding of this album, we’ll be able to make something grand, with all kinds of people. I’ve got a vision! My skill set is assembled. My supporting cast is assembled.  I’m calling on my music friends in Rwanda, Zambia, and Ghana to record parts for me. I’m calling on my music friends in America to record parts for me.  As these sounds come into the mix, I’m doing a series of small scale, Covid-safe shows to test things out. Maybe one of these will be in your backyard? As the world re-opens, my hope is for BeatMower to be the personal soundtrack to your Roaring 20s. I’m here to serve. </p>
<p>This is an album to make now. The very nature of BeatMower music lends itself to long-distance collaboration. There is so much pent-up energy in my friends and family and fans… When the time comes, I’m ready to celebrate with you.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support! And if you’re not in a place to contribute financially but still want to be involved, please be in touch. </p>
<p>Best,</p>

My impulse was to play music. I began weekly Saturday night shelter-in-place livestream sets, and BeatMower sounds bounced around living room dance parties across the globe. My partner Erin would come hang and dance and we’d connect with friends far away. For us and others, this was bliss after so much time in lockdown. 
This year, I’m asking my people to support me in going deeper.  If we can reach full funding of this album, we’ll be able to make something grand, with all kinds of people. I’ve got a vision! My skill set is assembled. My supporting cast is assembled.  I’m calling on my music friends in Rwanda, Zambia, and Ghana to record parts for me. I’m calling on my music friends in America to record parts for me.  As these sounds come into the mix, I’m doing a series of small scale, Covid-safe shows to test things out. Maybe one of these will be in your backyard? As the world re-opens, my hope is for BeatMower to be the personal soundtrack to your Roaring 20s. I’m here to serve. 
This is an album to make now. The very nature of BeatMower music lends itself to long-distance collaboration. There is so much pent-up energy in my friends and family and fans… When the time comes, I’m ready to celebrate with you.
Thanks for your support! And if you’re not in a place to contribute financially but still want to be involved, please be in touch. 
Best,

<h2>Who is here?</h2>
<p><strong>Super Opong Stars </strong>(previously <strong><i>Kyekyeku and Ghanalogue Highlife</i></strong> ) arose from the will to carry on, engage and evolve. Led by Kyekyeku, <strong>SOS</strong> believes that given the chance in the face of global lockdowns and greater inactivity musically, their contributions to culture and the socio-economic space can be immense through their music; Highlife - <strong>a s<i>tyle of African popular music evolving from the ’20s and later influencing a host of other African styles including Afrobeat with leading musicians including Ebo Taylor, Ambolley, Pat Thomas, The African Brothers Band, ET Mensah etc.</i></strong></p>
<p>In the last few years, <strong>Kyekyeku</strong> and his projects have brought their beautiful form of Highlife to a wide and varied audience outside its home country; <strong>Ghana</strong>.  In the process, performing in venues and festivals including <strong><i>Sauti Za Busara (Zanzibar), Montreux Jazz (Switzerland) Latitude (UK) Pirineos Sur (Spain) Kasumama (Austria) Canaria Jazz ( Canary Islands) Etnosur(Spain) Joy of Jazz (South Africa), New morning (France),</i></strong> etc with hard work and mostly without a dedicated booker, agency or label.</p>
<p>Kyekyeku's evolution has been greatly influenced by the experienced learned on this journey as well as the happenings in the global space in the last 2 years where society has changed a lot resulting in less music and less cultural activities. Consolidated into Super Opong Stars now, the evolution into a new sphere reflects Highlife music itself as it withstood the test of time and obstacles. </p>
<p>In advancing, Kyekyeku brings Super Opong Stars to explore the heritage and sonorities of this resilient music form with excitement and passion on an all-new album!</p>

<h3>What's more on our Crowdfunder?</h3>
<p><strong>You have self-produced 2 albums, why not do the same for this one?</strong></p>
<p>It was a good experience to learn how it all comes together, in the album-making process. we learned a lot. Currently, we would also love to have other hands make input in our art. This album presents the perfect opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Any Specific reason why you are recording at a specific studio?</strong></p>
<p>For this album unlike the first two, we are chasing specific sonorities that are quite unique and fit our style of music very well. We got recommended by a producer in France to check out the guys at Philophon. Once we did, we were convinced that was the sound we wanted. Now as the studio moved from Berlin to Ghana, we have the chance to bring our musicians in and finally make that album! However, their module of work meant it was not possible to record as an outside project which is not under their record label. so we had to persist.  </p>
<p><strong>Joy sounds studios, looks great, and mostly produces their own in-house band, How did you go to them as an outsider?</strong></p>
<p>It would nearly impossible to bring all the band to Germany to record especially now that tours were not happening, it would mean to put off recording until at least 2 years after. Fortunately, Philophon moved from Germany to Ghana a bit over a year ago and that met our ethos head-on. To record in Ghana, and still have the 70's sonics. There are great studios in Ghana but most are very contemporary in sound which is great but for this album, it has to fit specific sonic which only Joy Sounds can give. They are serious people and we are glad that finally they saw our seriousness as well and offered to break their rule for once to produce our album as a non-label project.</p>
<p><strong>So you are recording at Philophon’s Joy Sounds Studio, why not just use any basic studio?</strong></p>
<p>We are very sure of what we are going for, it meets our ideas and taste and we know everyone will love it as well when this album is done, any basic studio would never get us this amazing sound and character!</p>
<p><strong>What feelings do you have about your album, can we trust it’s any good</strong></p>
<p>​We are very elated over this album, when we did the tracking, without the mix we were already amazed at the color of sound that came with it, These wonderful style-defining songs we have deserve to carry the perfect character when recorded. We dare be biased and say the album is incredibly good, great Highlife, great Afrofunk, Great Afro Party, and more as it was and should be!</p>
<p><strong>You are weird, it's as if the pandemic means nothing to you! You haven’t mentioned it all?</strong></p>
<p>It's true, the Covid- 19 pandemic has impacted everyone so negatively that for us it's a bit ''selfish'' to talk about it but in truth like most musicians and artists, we have been heavily affected by it. Not performing means many things artistically, economically and psychologically.</p>
<p><strong>There is a global pandemic with no economic activity, people do not have money, why do you ask for donations?</strong></p>
<p>​No, it's not the perfect time to ask for money, however, we believe that to get society onto a more serene life again, we can all contribute in no small way to help put the smiles back on our faces. It's not strictly money, but also to share our message to your circles, sharing the campaign and helping move it around goes a long way to support us.</p>

<h3>Delivery of Perks.</h3>
<p>All shipping and postage will be made in August, reception of perks will therefore depend on distance from France. However, by mid-September, all shipments should have arrived.</p>
<p>Downloads will be available as soon as the album is ready for release which on our timeline is in August 2021.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>VERSION FRANCAISE</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Qui est là?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Super Opong Stars</strong> (anciennement <strong>Kyekyeku et Ghanalogue Highlife</strong>) sont nés de la volonté de continuer, de s'engager et d'évoluer. Dirigé par Kyekyeku, SOS estime que, étant donné la chance face aux verrouillages mondiaux et à une plus grande inactivité musicale, leurs contributions à la culture et à l'espace socio-économique peuvent être immenses à travers leur musique; Highlife<strong> -</strong><i><strong>un style de musique populaire africaine évoluant à partir des années 20 et plus tard influençant une foule d'autres styles africains, y compris l'afrobeat avec des musiciens de premier plan tels que Ebo Taylor, Ambolley, Pat Thomas, The African Brothers Band, ET Mensah, etc.</strong></i></p>
<p>Ces dernières années, Kyekyeku et ses projets ont apporté leur belle forme de Highlife à un public large et varié en dehors de son pays d'origine; Ghana. Dans le processus, se produisant dans des salles et des festivals tels que <strong>Sauti Za Busara (Zanzibar), Montreux Jazz (Suisse) Latitude (Royaume-Uni) Pirineos Sur (Espagne) Kasumama (Autriche) Canaria Jazz (Îles Canaries) Etnosur (Espagne) Joy of Jazz (Sud Afrique), New Morning (France)</strong>, etc. avec un travail acharné et la plupart du temps sans booker, agence ou label dédié.</p>
<p>L'évolution de Kyekyeku a été grandement influencée par l'expérience acquise au cours de ce voyage ainsi que par les événements dans l'espace mondial au cours des 2 dernières années où la société a beaucoup changé, ce qui a entraîné moins de musique et moins d'activités culturelles. Consolidé comme Super Opong Stars maintenant, l'évolution dans une nouvelle sphère reflète la musique Highlife elle-même alors qu'elle a résisté à l'épreuve du temps et des obstacles.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Qu'y a-t-il de plus sur notre Crowdfunder?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vous avez auto-produit 2 albums, pourquoi ne pas faire de même pour celui-ci?</strong><br/>Ce fut une bonne expérience d'apprendre comment tout cela s'enchaîne, dans le processus de création de l'album. Nous avons beaucoup appris. Actuellement, nous aimerions aussi que d'autres talents participent à notre projet. Cet album en est l'opportunité parfaite.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Une raison spécifique pour laquelle vous enregistrez dans un studio spécifique?</strong></p>
<p>Pour cet album contrairement aux deux premiers, nous recherchons des sonorités spécifiques qui sont assez uniques et correspondent très bien à notre style de musique. Nous avons été recommandés par un producteur en France pour voir les gars de Philophon. Une fois que nous l'avons fait, nous avons été convaincus que c'était le son que nous voulions. Maintenant que le studio a déménagé de Berlin au Ghana, nous avons la chance de faire venir nos musiciens et enfin de faire cet album! Cependant, leur module de travail signifiait qu'il n'était pas possible d'enregistrer en tant que projet extérieur qui ne soit pas sous leur label. nous avons donc dû persister.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Joy Sound Studio a fière allure et produit principalement ses  propres groupes en interne, comment êtes-vous allé vers eux en tant qu'artiste extèrieur?</strong></p>
<p>Il serait presque impossible d'amener tout le groupe en Allemagne pour enregistrer, surtout maintenant que les tournées n'avaient pas lieu, cela signifierait reporter l'enregistrement à au moins 2 ans après. Heureusement, Philophon a déménagé d'Allemagne au Ghana il y a un peu plus d'un an et cela a répondu de front à notre philosophie. Enregistrer au Ghana, et avoir toujours les sons des années 70. Il y a de grands studios au Ghana mais la plupart sont très contemporains dans le son, ce qui est génial mais pour cet album, il doit s'adapter à un son spécifique que seul Joy Sounds peut donner. Ce sont des gens sérieux et nous sommes heureux qu’ils aient finalement vu notre sérieux aussi et qu’ils aient proposé de briser leur règle pour une fois pour produire notre album en tant que projet hors label.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Vous enregistrez donc au Joy Sounds Studio de Philophon, pourquoi ne pas utiliser n’importe quel studio basique?</strong><br/>Nous sommes très sûrs de ce que nous recherchons, cela correspond à nos idées et à nos goûts et nous savons que tout le monde l'aimera aussi lorsque cet album sera terminé, aucun studio basique ne nous offrirait ce son et ce caractère incroyables!</p>
<p><br/><strong>Quels sentiments avez-vous à propos de votre album, pouvons-nous avoir confiance qu’il est bon?</strong><br/>Nous sommes très heureux de cet album, quand nous avons fait la prise de son, sans le mix, nous étions déjà étonnés de la couleur du son qui ressortait.Ces merveilleuses chansons qui définissent le style que nous avons, méritent d'avoir la texture sonore parfaite une fois enregistrées. Nous osons être impartials et affirmer que l'album est incroyablement bon, super Highlife, super Afrofunk, Great Afro Party, et plus encore comme il était et devrait être!</p>
<p><br/><strong>Quelle est la particularité des gens qui vous donnent de l'argent, il y a des dizaines d'autres projets qui ont besoin de cet argent?</strong><br/>En vérité, nous voulons partager la fierté de ce futur album phare avec tout le monde, c'est un moyen d'amener les gens à faire partie de notre histoire. I</p>
<p><br/><strong>Vous êtes bizarre, c'est comme si la pandémie ne signifiait rien pour vous! Vous ne l'avez pas tout mentionné?</strong><br/>C'est vrai, la pandémie de Covid-19 a eu un impact si négatif sur tout le monde que pour nous c'est un peu «égoïste» d'en parler mais en vérité, comme la plupart des musiciens et artistes, nous en avons été fortement affectés. Ne pas pouvoir jouer devant un public a un énorme impact artistiquement, économiquement et psychologiquement.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Il y a une pandémie mondiale sans activité économique, les gens n'ont pas d'argent, pourquoi demandez-vous des dons?</strong><br/>C'est vrai, ce n'est pas le moment idéal pour demander de l'argent, cependant, nous pensons que pour ramener la société à une vie plus sereine, nous pouvons tous contribuer de manière non négligeable à redonner le sourire à nos visages. Il ne s'agit pas uniquement d'argent, mais aussi de partager notre message avec vos cercles, partager la campagne parmi vos proches et votre réseau et aider à faire circuler l'information – cela est déjà d'un grand soutien.</p>

In the last few years, Kyekyeku and his projects have brought their beautiful form of Highlife to a wide and varied audience outside its home country; Ghana.  In the process, performing in venues and festivals including Sauti Za Busara (Zanzibar), Montreux Jazz (Switzerland) Latitude (UK) Pirineos Sur (Spain) Kasumama (Austria) Canaria Jazz ( Canary Islands) Etnosur(Spain) Joy of Jazz (South Africa), New morning (France), etc with hard work and mostly without a dedicated booker, agency or label.
Kyekyeku's evolution has been greatly influenced by the experienced learned on this journey as well as the happenings in the global space in the last 2 years where society has changed a lot resulting in less music and less cultural activities. Consolidated into Super Opong Stars now, the evolution into a new sphere reflects Highlife music itself as it withstood the test of time and obstacles. 
In advancing, Kyekyeku brings Super Opong Stars to explore the heritage and sonorities of this resilient music form with excitement and passion on an all-new album!

What's more on our Crowdfunder?
You have self-produced 2 albums, why not do the same for this one?
It was a good experience to learn how it all comes together, in the album-making process. we learned a lot. Currently, we would also love to have other hands make input in our art. This album presents the perfect opportunity.
Any Specific reason why you are recording at a specific studio?
For this album unlike the first two, we are chasing specific sonorities that are quite unique and fit our style of music very well. We got recommended by a producer in France to check out the guys at Philophon. Once we did, we were convinced that was the sound we wanted. Now as the studio moved from Berlin to Ghana, we have the chance to bring our musicians in and finally make that album! However, their module of work meant it was not possible to record as an outside project which is not under their record label. so we had to persist.  
Joy sounds studios, looks great, and mostly produces their own in-house band, How did you go to them as an outsider?
It would nearly impossible to bring all the band to Germany to record especially now that tours were not happening, it would mean to put off recording until at least 2 years after. Fortunately, Philophon moved from Germany to Ghana a bit over a year ago and that met our ethos head-on. To record in Ghana, and still have the 70's sonics. There are great studios in Ghana but most are very contemporary in sound which is great but for this album, it has to fit specific sonic which only Joy Sounds can give. They are serious people and we are glad that finally they saw our seriousness as well and offered to break their rule for once to produce our album as a non-label project.
So you are recording at Philophon’s Joy Sounds Studio, why not just use any basic studio?
We are very sure of what we are going for, it meets our ideas and taste and we know everyone will love it as well when this album is done, any basic studio would never get us this amazing sound and character!
What feelings do you have about your album, can we trust it’s any good
​We are very elated over this album, when we did the tracking, without the mix we were already amazed at the color of sound that came with it, These wonderful style-defining songs we have deserve to carry the perfect character when recorded. We dare be biased and say the album is incredibly good, great Highlife, great Afrofunk, Great Afro Party, and more as it was and should be!
You are weird, it's as if the pandemic means nothing to you! You haven’t mentioned it all?
It's true, the Covid- 19 pandemic has impacted everyone so negatively that for us it's a bit ''selfish'' to talk about it but in truth like most musicians and artists, we have been heavily affected by it. Not performing means many things artistically, economically and psychologically.
There is a global pandemic with no economic activity, people do not have money, why do you ask for donations?
​No, it's not the perfect time to ask for money, however, we believe that to get society onto a more serene life again, we can all contribute in no small way to help put the smiles back on our faces. It's not strictly money, but also to share our message to your circles, sharing the campaign and helping move it around goes a long way to support us.

 
Delivery of Perks.
All shipping and postage will be made in August, reception of perks will therefore depend on distance from France. However, by mid-September, all shipments should have arrived.
Downloads will be available as soon as the album is ready for release which on our timeline is in August 2021.
 
VERSION FRANCAISE
 
Qui est là?
Super Opong Stars (anciennement Kyekyeku et Ghanalogue Highlife) sont nés de la volonté de continuer, de s'engager et d'évoluer. Dirigé par Kyekyeku, SOS estime que, étant donné la chance face aux verrouillages mondiaux et à une plus grande inactivité musicale, leurs contributions à la culture et à l'espace socio-économique peuvent être immenses à travers leur musique; Highlife -un style de musique populaire africaine évoluant à partir des années 20 et plus tard influençant une foule d'autres styles africains, y compris l'afrobeat avec des musiciens de premier plan tels que Ebo Taylor, Ambolley, Pat Thomas, The African Brothers Band, ET Mensah, etc.
Ces dernières années, Kyekyeku et ses projets ont apporté leur belle forme de Highlife à un public large et varié en dehors de son pays d'origine; Ghana. Dans le processus, se produisant dans des salles et des festivals tels que Sauti Za Busara (Zanzibar), Montreux Jazz (Suisse) Latitude (Royaume-Uni) Pirineos Sur (Espagne) Kasumama (Autriche) Canaria Jazz (Îles Canaries) Etnosur (Espagne) Joy of Jazz (Sud Afrique), New Morning (France), etc. avec un travail acharné et la plupart du temps sans booker, agence ou label dédié.
L'évolution de Kyekyeku a été grandement influencée par l'expérience acquise au cours de ce voyage ainsi que par les événements dans l'espace mondial au cours des 2 dernières années où la société a beaucoup changé, ce qui a entraîné moins de musique et moins d'activités culturelles. Consolidé comme Super Opong Stars maintenant, l'évolution dans une nouvelle sphère reflète la musique Highlife elle-même alors qu'elle a résisté à l'épreuve du temps et des obstacles.

Ne pas atteindre notre objectif total signifie que les choses seront plus difficiles qu'elles ne le sont déjà, et malheureusement, nous ne réaliserons peut-être pas notre rêve.

 
Qu'y a-t-il de plus sur notre Crowdfunder?
 
Vous avez auto-produit 2 albums, pourquoi ne pas faire de même pour celui-ci?Ce fut une bonne expérience d'apprendre comment tout cela s'enchaîne, dans le processus de création de l'album. Nous avons beaucoup appris. Actuellement, nous aimerions aussi que d'autres talents participent à notre projet. Cet album en est l'opportunité parfaite. 
Une raison spécifique pour laquelle vous enregistrez dans un studio spécifique?
Pour cet album contrairement aux deux premiers, nous recherchons des sonorités spécifiques qui sont assez uniques et correspondent très bien à notre style de musique. Nous avons été recommandés par un producteur en France pour voir les gars de Philophon. Une fois que nous l'avons fait, nous avons été convaincus que c'était le son que nous voulions. Maintenant que le studio a déménagé de Berlin au Ghana, nous avons la chance de faire venir nos musiciens et enfin de faire cet album! Cependant, leur module de travail signifiait qu'il n'était pas possible d'enregistrer en tant que projet extérieur qui ne soit pas sous leur label. nous avons donc dû persister.
Joy Sound Studio a fière allure et produit principalement ses  propres groupes en interne, comment êtes-vous allé vers eux en tant qu'artiste extèrieur?
Il serait presque impossible d'amener tout le groupe en Allemagne pour enregistrer, surtout maintenant que les tournées n'avaient pas lieu, cela signifierait reporter l'enregistrement à au moins 2 ans après. Heureusement, Philophon a déménagé d'Allemagne au Ghana il y a un peu plus d'un an et cela a répondu de front à notre philosophie. Enregistrer au Ghana, et avoir toujours les sons des années 70. Il y a de grands studios au Ghana mais la plupart sont très contemporains dans le son, ce qui est génial mais pour cet album, il doit s'adapter à un son spécifique que seul Joy Sounds peut donner. Ce sont des gens sérieux et nous sommes heureux qu’ils aient finalement vu notre sérieux aussi et qu’ils aient proposé de briser leur règle pour une fois pour produire notre album en tant que projet hors label.
Vous enregistrez donc au Joy Sounds Studio de Philophon, pourquoi ne pas utiliser n’importe quel studio basique?Nous sommes très sûrs de ce que nous recherchons, cela correspond à nos idées et à nos goûts et nous savons que tout le monde l'aimera aussi lorsque cet album sera terminé, aucun studio basique ne nous offrirait ce son et ce caractère incroyables!
Quels sentiments avez-vous à propos de votre album, pouvons-nous avoir confiance qu’il est bon?Nous sommes très heureux de cet album, quand nous avons fait la prise de son, sans le mix, nous étions déjà étonnés de la couleur du son qui ressortait.Ces merveilleuses chansons qui définissent le style que nous avons, méritent d'avoir la texture sonore parfaite une fois enregistrées. Nous osons être impartials et affirmer que l'album est incroyablement bon, super Highlife, super Afrofunk, Great Afro Party, et plus encore comme il était et devrait être!
Quelle est la particularité des gens qui vous donnent de l'argent, il y a des dizaines d'autres projets qui ont besoin de cet argent?En vérité, nous voulons partager la fierté de ce futur album phare avec tout le monde, c'est un moyen d'amener les gens à faire partie de notre histoire. I
Vous êtes bizarre, c'est comme si la pandémie ne signifiait rien pour vous! Vous ne l'avez pas tout mentionné?C'est vrai, la pandémie de Covid-19 a eu un impact si négatif sur tout le monde que pour nous c'est un peu «égoïste» d'en parler mais en vérité, comme la plupart des musiciens et artistes, nous en avons été fortement affectés. Ne pas pouvoir jouer devant un public a un énorme impact artistiquement, économiquement et psychologiquement.
Il y a une pandémie mondiale sans activité économique, les gens n'ont pas d'argent, pourquoi demandez-vous des dons?C'est vrai, ce n'est pas le moment idéal pour demander de l'argent, cependant, nous pensons que pour ramener la société à une vie plus sereine, nous pouvons tous contribuer de manière non négligeable à redonner le sourire à nos visages. Il ne s'agit pas uniquement d'argent, mais aussi de partager notre message avec vos cercles, partager la campagne parmi vos proches et votre réseau et aider à faire circuler l'information – cela est déjà d'un grand soutien.
 
Avons-nous des avantages pour vous?
En fait, il y a des avantages vraiment cools et sympas qui ont été conçus pour se rapprocher le plus possible de vous et de vous.

<h3>Hi Beautiful Souls!</h3>
<p>I'm an independent artist that loves to create pop, R&amp;B soul music, and I'm heavily inspired by the great iconic George Michael.</p>
<p>In February 2020, I released my first music video for the single “Someone Just Like You”. The song quickly started to gain popularity with my amazing fans across the globe, especially in the UK where it was recognized by UKSC (United Kingdom’s Song Writing Contest) as a Semi-Finalist.</p>
<p>That summer of 2020 I was invited to tour and perform “Someone Just Like You” in the United Kingdom but unfortunately the COVID pandemic hit and the tour was cancelled. Being a new independent artist, it was a big hit to take, as I planned to use those funds, raised from touring and gigs to finance my new music projects.</p>
<p>Due to lack of funds, I began recording cover tunes instead. Here are the three cover tunes I recorded since then;</p>
<p> You Are So Beautiful - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qivq5K_gIw4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qivq5K_gIw4</a></p>

<p>During that time, I also continued to write and produce four new great original songs in my home studio. I'm excited to finally release my first single  ""I Want You Baby"". The song has an old school pop vibe, with a modern twist that I know you're going to love!</p>
<p>Being an independent artist, the process to complete the song has taken a little longer. ""I Want You Baby"" is almost ready for release but requires your help and support to get it to the finish line!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's How You Help &amp; What You Get!</h3>
<p>I need to cover the additional costs of having the song, mixed and mastered, along with a music video production. </p>
<p>So I’m gratefully asking for your support and donations to help me release “I Want You Baby"".</p>
<p>In return you will receive many great perks for your donations. </p>
<p>As many of you know I have a profound faith in God and Jesus. My beautiful mother showed me the way, and I’m forever grateful for that.</p>
<p>I’m also sincerely grateful to all the beautiful souls/supporters, that have been a continuous light in my life, supporting my music.</p>
<p>God has given me a gift to enrich lives using my musical talent, that brings meaning, purpose, hope and faith to each and everyone of you. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>     In June of 2017, I released my very first Hip-hop album titled <a href=""http://hyperurl.co/LukeWayne-Raindrop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Raindrop</a> under the name Luke Wayne.  My intentions for the album were a project that was void of any profanity and had a strong focus on spirituality and the God within all of us.  I see water as something pure and transparent which is what I wanted the album to represent.  All 13 tracks were written, produced, recorded, mixed, and mastered by myself.  It took about 4 months of working on the album every day to complete it.  The first month was spent making beats and writing to them in my dorm in San Francisco, CA while studying Music Production at The Academy of Art University.  Once every song was ready to be recorded, I was blessed to be able to record in the school's professional studio which was fully equipped with an isolation booth and a 5.1 surround sound set up but no engineer to work with.  Recording is one of my favorite parts of music but it was time consuming to record vocals for the 9 songs I rapped on due to the fact that it was up to me to get the studio up and running and I had to run in and out of the booth in between every take.  After about one month of recording, I worked every day for about 2 months editing, mixing, and mastering all 13 tracks in my dorm and in the school's studio.  I'm grateful that one of my friends while I was attending college is a photographer and offered to take professional pictures of me for my album's cover art.  We went with blue lighting and my hands together for a watery, spiritual feel. I created my own website to display the album and paid to have it distributed through all platforms because I was proud of my work and wanted to share it with everyone everywhere.  I even went out of my way to copyright the album through the U.S. Copyright Office to receive official documentation.  Long story short, Raindrop taught me how expensive recording music can be and how important it is to work with others who share the same vision as you.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>     This time around, I want to work with a mixing engineer who is more experienced than me and can help me find a creative sound.  I want to record and release an EP titled Ripples to follow the drop of <a href=""http://hyperurl.co/LukeWayne-Raindrop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Raindrop</a>.  The main goal of this page is to raise money to help fund studio time in Ventura, CA.  I want to pay to work with a recording engineer who will help me track my vocals so that I don't have to step out of the booth.  I want to take guidance from an outside source and pay for mixing and mastering services so that I can include others in my sound and come out with one totally differently.  If anything, I want to edit down my own vocals to send out to get mixed and mastered but I do not want to apply any effects on my own.  Because I'm back home in Ventura and distance has separated me with my photographer friend who lives in San Francisco, I may have to pay to get some kind of cover art done.  Instead of making my own beats, I have made a deal with a producer for a license for 4 of his own beats to rap over.  I am currently working two minimum wage jobs and am always setting money aside for music but in order to get this project sounding how I envision it, I'm going to need your help.  Music is very spontaneous to me and I think the best way to capture the energy of a song is to record it close to the date it was thought of.  I like to record something while it is fresh and although I can afford to record this EP in the future, I do not want to wait until I have the funds to do so.  Raising $1,000 will allow me to purchase the 4 beats I have in negotiation, studio time with a recording engineer,  mixing and mastering services, cover art, and distribution. </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>     I am asking for help because there is only so much I can do.  I struggle financially at times but I always try my best to spread the word for friends or share their posts when I'm unable to give them exactly what they're asking for.  Please help me out by sharing this page or simply listening to my music if you are unable to contribute financially. </p>

<p>About</p>
<p>The first year of the Wyoming Singer-Songwriter Competition has wrapped up and now comes the fun part: putting it all out there!</p>
<p>The aim of this fundraiser is documentation, and our documentation goal has two primary objectives:</p>
<p>1) Record or collect recordings from every song from the competition for digital archives (to go into a museum some day, along with photographs, videos, etc).</p>
<p>2)  To professionally record and compile a multi-disc compilation album including at least one song from every contestant and also the top songs from each round.  This catalog of songs will start populating an ongoing Wyoming Singer-Songwriters collection that can be found on Spotify and other digital media channels (hello world!).</p>
<p>Here are some examples, top songs from the final round of the competition: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK6SI6-HMb-Rl3BskQwWQ3KIAz59IE74j"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK6SI6-H...</a></p>
<p>We have lined up professional recording studios in Casper and Laramie ready to record the songs that these contestants performed. At a basic level we will capture ALL competition songs.  For the songs chosen for the compilation, we will take multiple recordings and carefully mix down and master the final versions.  All of this will be professionally released with lyrics and photographs.  We are planning multiple avenues for recording including live takes before a crowd during promotional events.  These will be fun events, and this will be a fun project, and everyone who has been involved thus far can attest that this effort will produce a truly great body of work that the world needs to hear.</p>
<p>If we surpass our goal, additional funds will go towards professional recordings of every competition round at future events.  We will also be able to make professionally mixed recordings of all songs from the event, as opposed to just one for the compilation, with two other rougher recordings for documentation purposes.</p>
<p>Wyoming Singer-Songwriters is Nonprofit Corporation registered with the state of Wyoming and currently awaiting 501(C)(3) status from the IRS.  All rights to the written songs will be retained with the artist, however we will have rights to publish the recordings with the compilation so that the whole collection can be sold (very reasonably) without parsing out fractions of royalties to a large number of individuals.  Also, we will happily allow the artists to publish any recordings they make themselves.  We have promised from the start to make this effort most beneficial the incredible singer-songwriters across Wyoming</p>

<p>The risks of the project we think are minimal. The competition provides an avenue to showcase music that might not otherwise other reach an audience (or such a wide audience).

</div></div>","About
The first year of the Wyoming Singer-Songwriter Competition has wrapped up and now comes the fun part: putting it all out there!
The aim of this fundraiser is documentation, and our documentation goal has two primary objectives:
1) Record or collect recordings from every song from the competition for digital archives (to go into a museum some day, along with photographs, videos, etc).
2)  To professionally record and compile a multi-disc compilation album including at least one song from every contestant and also the top songs from each round.  This catalog of songs will start populating an ongoing Wyoming Singer-Songwriters collection that can be found on Spotify and other digital media channels (hello world!).
Here are some examples, top songs from the final round of the competition: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK6SI6-H...
We have lined up professional recording studios in Casper and Laramie ready to record the songs that these contestants performed. At a basic level we will capture ALL competition songs.  For the songs chosen for the compilation, we will take multiple recordings and carefully mix down and master the final versions.  All of this will be professionally released with lyrics and photographs.  We are planning multiple avenues for recording including live takes before a crowd during promotional events.  These will be fun events, and this will be a fun project, and everyone who has been involved thus far can attest that this effort will produce a truly great body of work that the world needs to hear.
If we surpass our goal, additional funds will go towards professional recordings of every competition round at future events.  We will also be able to make professionally mixed recordings of all songs from the event, as opposed to just one for the compilation, with two other rougher recordings for documentation purposes.
Wyoming Singer-Songwriters is Nonprofit Corporation registered with the state of Wyoming and currently awaiting 501(C)(3) status from the IRS.  All rights to the written songs will be retained with the artist, however we will have rights to publish the recordings with the compilation so that the whole collection can be sold (very reasonably) without parsing out fractions of royalties to a large number of individuals.  Also, we will happily allow the artists to publish any recordings they make themselves.  We have promised from the start to make this effort most beneficial the incredible singer-songwriters across Wyoming

I have enjoyed producing music for worship leaders and singers and yet always felt that there was a missing element in my own music. I needed to collaborate with another worship leader who was as passionate about singing as I was about music.</p><p>Seth and I have worked together on a number of projects over the years and during one of sessions, we started worshiping together and that was the beginning of The Merging concept.  </p><p>As you can hear on the video, Seth is an amazing singer and yet I'm drawn to the Lord when I hear him sing, and that's the true sign of an anointed worship leader. We both have a heart for worship and helping people experience His presence in a fresh dynamic way. This is a merging of Heaven and Earth as well bringing together the generations and the diversity of culture in our worship gatherings.  We enjoy gospel, soul, contemporary CCM, modern worship and even country genres. This was a perfect fit as worship has become very performance orientated and needs to be more vertical at the same time incorporating a diversity of music styles.  </p><p>We have already begun production in the studio and will continue as far as possible. We do, however, need your help to raise funds to launch our vision and bring these new songs and music to your community.

I have enjoyed producing music for worship leaders and singers and yet always felt that there was a missing element in my own music. I needed to collaborate with another worship leader who was as passionate about singing as I was about music.Seth and I have worked together on a number of projects over the years and during one of sessions, we started worshiping together and that was the beginning of The Merging concept.  As you can hear on the video, Seth is an amazing singer and yet I'm drawn to the Lord when I hear him sing, and that's the true sign of an anointed worship leader. We both have a heart for worship and helping people experience His presence in a fresh dynamic way. This is a merging of Heaven and Earth as well bringing together the generations and the diversity of culture in our worship gatherings.  We enjoy gospel, soul, contemporary CCM, modern worship and even country genres. This was a perfect fit as worship has become very performance orientated and needs to be more vertical at the same time incorporating a diversity of music styles.  We have already begun production in the studio and will continue as far as possible. We do, however, need your help to raise funds to launch our vision and bring these new songs and music to your community. We would love to come to your city to do worship gatherings and workshops for singers, musicians and songwriters. The Merging will release a new worship recording early 2018 along with a website that will contain our calendar of live events, and workshops .Thank you for supporting this project: we would also value your help in sharing this link with your network of friends.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>(Listen to / download for free the single <a href=""https://tennesseekamanski.bandcamp.com/track/great-american-novel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Great American Novel</a> )</p>
<p>Starting in August, I will begin work on an EP and music video. Though I have recorded and released music here and there on my own before, I am considering this my first major release, due to how confident in the songs I am, and in the folks working on them with me.  My whole life so far playing music and writing songs, I was either waiting for my hands to catch up with my head or vis versa. Though I know this will continue in my whole life learning, these songs find me at a cool crossroads of the two that I think is worth documenting. This EP is stitched from tiny melodies keeping me company driving solo through the pink boulders of the Nevada desert, the clumsy goodbyes to graceful friends, and the reflections in bays of the unfairness of unpreparedness. This collection of songs is very important to me, so I want capture them the right way. This means being able to pay the musicians and collaborators that help me to fully realize it. I have really incredible artists working with me of whom I'm in awe and greatly indebted to, and I want to be able to give them the compensation they deserve for their brilliance. </p>
<p>I'm creating a music video (my first ever!) with the incredible videographer Anthony Sabatino. We met this Spring while both working an odd job at the Coachella Valley Music &amp; Arts festival. Together we've created a unique storyboard and concept based on a very pivotal book, Ask The Dust by John Fante. </p>
<p>My best friend and favorite living songwriter Aaron Dennis is engineering and producing the EP, and I am so grateful for his propensity for unearthly beauty, and in the harnessing and manifestation of outlandish ideas.</p>
<p>In addition to the songs and video themselves I am working on creating a very unique physical copy of the album. Earlier this spring I released a mixtape for which I made handmade cassettes, and I want to run further with that idea and create physical copies that will be as important as the songs.</p>
<p>I'm hoping for the opportunity to add some of my favorite session musicians to the team as well, to fill out the sound to the extent I've dreamed it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'd saved up money all year for this project, but ended up spending quite a bit of it last minute on the medical expenses of a runt kitten that was handed to me behind the laundromat. She's amazing, and was totally worth it, but came into my life at a very inopportune moment, just as most true love tends to.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm trying to raise 4200 to cover the cost of musician compensation, mixing and mastering, costs incurred by the making of the video for Great American Novel, travel expenses for recording, creation of the physical copies of the EP, and in planning a tour. </li>
<li>I'm exchanging some cool perks for donations, including digital downloads, handmade one of a kind physical copies, embroidery, custom acoustic covers, and house shows!</li>
<li>I'll make good on these promises of whether I reach my goal or not- if theres a will theres a way and I've got buckets of will!</li>
</ul>

(Listen to / download for free the single Great American Novel )
Starting in August, I will begin work on an EP and music video. Though I have recorded and released music here and there on my own before, I am considering this my first major release, due to how confident in the songs I am, and in the folks working on them with me.  My whole life so far playing music and writing songs, I was either waiting for my hands to catch up with my head or vis versa. Though I know this will continue in my whole life learning, these songs find me at a cool crossroads of the two that I think is worth documenting. This EP is stitched from tiny melodies keeping me company driving solo through the pink boulders of the Nevada desert, the clumsy goodbyes to graceful friends, and the reflections in bays of the unfairness of unpreparedness. This collection of songs is very important to me, so I want capture them the right way. This means being able to pay the musicians and collaborators that help me to fully realize it. I have really incredible artists working with me of whom I'm in awe and greatly indebted to, and I want to be able to give them the compensation they deserve for their brilliance. 
I'm creating a music video (my first ever!) with the incredible videographer Anthony Sabatino. We met this Spring while both working an odd job at the Coachella Valley Music & Arts festival. Together we've created a unique storyboard and concept based on a very pivotal book, Ask The Dust by John Fante. 
My best friend and favorite living songwriter Aaron Dennis is engineering and producing the EP, and I am so grateful for his propensity for unearthly beauty, and in the harnessing and manifestation of outlandish ideas.
In addition to the songs and video themselves I am working on creating a very unique physical copy of the album. Earlier this spring I released a mixtape for which I made handmade cassettes, and I want to run further with that idea and create physical copies that will be as important as the songs.
I'm hoping for the opportunity to add some of my favorite session musicians to the team as well, to fill out the sound to the extent I've dreamed it.

What We Need & What You Get
I'd saved up money all year for this project, but ended up spending quite a bit of it last minute on the medical expenses of a runt kitten that was handed to me behind the laundromat. She's amazing, and was totally worth it, but came into my life at a very inopportune moment, just as most true love tends to.

I'm trying to raise 4200 to cover the cost of musician compensation, mixing and mastering, costs incurred by the making of the video for Great American Novel, travel expenses for recording, creation of the physical copies of the EP, and in planning a tour. 
I'm exchanging some cool perks for donations, including digital downloads, handmade one of a kind physical copies, embroidery, custom acoustic covers, and house shows!
I'll make good on these promises of whether I reach my goal or not- if theres a will theres a way and I've got buckets of will!


The Impact
Being able to record and release this EP will give me an invaluable leg up in terms of approaching labels for representation, and ultimately getting exposure to a larger audience. Not only that but I'll have merch for shows, and the ability to put together a full live band, and set out on tour.

<p>As a singer/songwriter and hip-hop artist, creativity has always been my passion. This album and documentary project is about realizing my dream of creating something sonically impactful, visually stunning, and culturally significant. ""Black Madonna"" is an album that will be conceptualized and recorded in  some of the places that inspire me, with a companion documentary being simultaneously filmed. My hope is that this project brings us closer together, as women and as people, and sets us on the path to healing, equality, and the achievement of our dreams.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise at least $50,000 which will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Music &amp; Video equipment - I will be building a ""mobile"" production studio capable of recording and editing while on the road.</li>
<li>Mixing and mastering of the album - completing the audio project with professional mixing and mastering.</li>
<li>Album and documentary artwork - original artwork for both the album and documentary.</li>
<li>Post production costs for the documentary - editing and finalizing the documentary.</li>
<li>Production/post production costs for a music video - a video for the song ""Black Madonna"" which will be the lead single for the album.</li>
<li>Travel &amp; accommodation expenses - the album and documentary will be recorded during travel to a select list of places that have inspired and/or are in alignment with the message of Black Madonna. The destinations on our itinerary so far are: L.A. California, Brazil, Egypt, the Caribbean, UK/London, and Mexico.</li>
<li>Artist development expenses - building myself to be a better artist physically and mentally, as well as branding.</li>
<li>Marketing and promotional expenses - related to promoting Black Madonna.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I do not reach my goal, the funds I do raise will be spent on the recording, marketing and promotion, and artist development aspects of this plan. If I exceed my goal, I will continue to travel and record additional material for another project.</p>
<p>It's been a major focus of mine to cultivate a sense of sisterhood with the women in my life, both personally and professionally. Black Madonna gives me a chance to do that on a larger scale, and be a part of the growing social movement for gender equality. As a black woman, who is a hiphop artist, this is hugely significant and deeply personal to me.</p>
<p>Women are fighting each other everywhere you look--mostly for ratings/views and likes and shares. I’ve often said that shows featuring women fighting each other make up more than half of reality TV programming, and that's starting to translate into pop culture at large. It’s time for the rise of other narratives, that represent more than just one aspect of women--that show who we are outside of the stereotypical sexuality and cattiness.</p>
<p>It’s time for a change in the entertainment industry. Sexually objectifying ourselves should not be a requirement of success--it should be our choice how we want to present and define ourselves. Women who choose not to lead with their sexuality should not be excluded from mainstream music and/or pop culture for doing so.  Women in the music industry should not be pitted against each other to fight over one spot at the top. There is plenty of space for different points of view.  Black Madonna represents me taking back the power to define my own reality as a woman, and sharing that empowerment with women everywhere.</p>

<h3>Who I am and why I am doing this :)</h3>
<p>My name is Shada Diab, I am 23 years old from Nazareth, I study Cinema and English in Tel-Aviv University. I play the piano and learn vocal lessons for a year now.<br/>Since I was a little girl I knew I had a goal, it was to try and make my community a better place for people to live in without having to give up what makes them special, different and unique.<br/>Through art I can express myself the best i can, I can send my message to so many people. I believe that music is the language everyone understand, it moves you even if you don't quite agree with what it says, and this is exactly what I am trying to do in my community, bring people closer to each other by understanding that our differences doesn't break up apart but rather make us stronger.</p>
<p>The LGBT community in the Arab world is still being severely discriminated against, and this issue needs to be discussed and talked about. The song is written by me,  it's in Arabic and English and talks about how strong you have to be if you are different, how much strength it requires to stand in front of the world and say this is who i am and i will not hide or change. The video is going to tell the story or a love song by two girls and what they have to go through in this community in order to be together. <br/><br/> </p>

<ul>
<li>I need 9000 dollars, 1000 dollar is the price of the melody, the rest will go for recording and producing the video which will be in a very high level. </li>

The song is written by me,  it's in Arabic and English and talks about how strong you have to be if you are different, how much strength it requires to stand in front of the world and say this is who i am and i will not hide or change. The video is going to tell the story or a love song by two girls and what they have to go through in this community in order to be together.  
 

 

I need 9000 dollars, 1000 dollar is the price of the melody, the rest will go for recording and producing the video which will be in a very high level. 
The song will be in  Arabic and English which will be a very interesting combination 
If I don't get the entire fund the money i raise will go to support the project while i try to get the funds from other sources.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>My Project:</h2>
<p>Hello everybody! I'm Jo Oliver — a singer-songwriter &amp; multi-instrumentalist based in the creative city of Berlin, Germany. (Here you can visit my homepage: <a href=""http://www.jooliver.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.jooliver.net</a>)</p>
<p>For many years I have been living from making music in many different ways: playing guitar and other instruments live and in studio-situations, composing, arranging &amp; producing music for others, writing and publishing music-teaching-books ...</p>
<p>But 4 years ago, I discovered my really new passion - SINGING!</p>
<p>Under my artist name Jo Oliver I bring all my talents of writing songs, playing instruments, singing and arranging and producing these songs together. For me it's something totally new and a really big thing - excited where my musical journey will bring me...</p>
<p>So I would like to invite you to be a part of my musical journey!</p>
<p>I am working on a studio album that is to be supposed to be released in 2018. But first I have to release my debut single. The preproduction is already done (but I'm still working on the tune to ""polish"" it up...) but the next step is, to bring it on a higher level of video production. When the audio- &amp; video-production is finished, my song ""shine on (you)"" should be released and promoted. But before anybody will download a new song from a unknown artist, one needs to do radio-promotion.</p>
<p>For both (video-production &amp; radio-promotion) I need your support for a budget. The higher the budget the higher the video-quality and I can spend more for the (expensive) radio-promotion. There are promo-agencies to be paid, and at least the finished song has to be professionally mastered. Depending on the money to be funded, there maybe will also be a budget for a CD-printing (plus shipping costs to be shipped to as many international radio stations as possible).</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>budget &amp; perks in detail:</h3>
</div><p>As a musician you always spend all of your money for instruments &amp; equipment - same toI do... but as a multi-instrumentalist I have to spend 5 times more for guitars, basses, drums, keyboards, microphones and studio-equipment! I'm not asking for money for my instruments &amp; stuff in this campaign, even if I would be glad to be able for example to buy me a better bassguitar or a better drumset. (This is not part of this campaign)</p><p><strong>production &amp; promotion expances:</strong></p><p>1, What I need in this case is a budget to pay one or some video-professionals to help me putting the video-production on a higher level. Everything is already planned: I will do multicam-recordings and bring it partly on a split-screen in the postproduction for a better impression of what I am doing as a single musician who is representing a whole band plus choir and lead-singer! Depending on the budget raised from this campaign I can do it more or less professionally - but it will be done anyway.</p><p>2, When the audio production is finished one needs a second pair of ears going through the mix, especially if you did all the recordings alone as this is the case. This second pair of ears should be from a professional ""mastering-engineer"", who is doing some ""fine adjustments"" on the finished mix. That will be a great effect for your ears, especially if you own a good stereo/HiFi-system. I really want my fans to enjoy my music from the performance to all technical aspects...</p><p>3, No promotion without radio: For an upcoming artist, radio is still absolutly necessary to be perceived from the world. For radio promotion you can spend thousands of dollars (like the major record companies are doing), but at least you still need a minimum of some hundred dollars to start. Even if some radio stations still like CDs, the majority of them wants to be delivered online from so called radio promotion networks or agencies. These agencies do deliver your song to the radio-stations for a certain amount of money. But furthermore, you still have to contact these stations, send them artist-informations and so on, to ask them if they have downloaded and do like your song and sometimes you should ship some more informations... it varies from country to country.</p><p>In case I receive more than the requested budget-target, I will spend every cent on the radio promotion... it's the foundation of every musical career!</p><p><strong>fantastic perks you will receive for your support:</strong></p><p>As I am a well-known music teaching book author (under my real name = Jörg Sieghart) in my homeland Germany, I can offer some great limited editions (in English) of some of my books. If you are interested in blues guitar, there will be some extraordinary blues lick videos for you in different bundles. And of course you will get my music as MP3-, WAV- or Video-formats... futhermore there are T-shirts, signed drum sticks or guitar belts and other intersting stuff.</p><p>It might be really valuable in some years - who knows? :-)</p><p>My Amazon author-site (in german):</p><p><a href=""https://www.amazon.de/J%C3%B6rg-Sieghart/e/B00HDPKDGQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amazon.de/J%C3%B6rg-Sieghart/e/B00HDPKDGQ</a></p><p>My (german) Youtube channel for guitar instructions:</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1gbO8yUa0HH4khEZr5DZ6A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1gbO8yUa0HH4khEZr5DZ6A</a></p><div> <h3>What it means to me:</h3>
<ul></ul>
<p><strong>Music is my passion!</strong> <span xml:lang=""EN-GB"">It means to me to express myself and to carry music in your heart…. Music or rather making music is a great deal more than only exercising, cobbling sounds together and performing a song: It is always a journey into yourself, a contribution to your inner balance, zest for life and growing awareness.</span> My song ""Shine On"" is about gratitude... but there are a lot of different topics my songs are about: consciousness, values, little stories, emotions and a lot of stuff to think about... and my music itself is influenced by strong grooves, rock guitars and a lot of harmony vocals (backing vocals/choir) like you know it from bands such as Queen with the singer Freddie Mercury.</p>
<p>In the past some of my songs got radio airplay and some hit the chartlists, but I never sung these songs by myself and I never made big money out of that... but there is still the unstopable passion of writing good and melodic songs that will be catchy for your ears - it will transport good vibes and happyness to the listener!</p>
<p>Well, the music-market is huge and if I listen to German radio stations, I hear mostly electronical beats - nevertheless, I believe in my talents and in the simple fact, that out there, there must be some more peple who appreciate real ""handmade"" music, with melodic songs, strong grooves, strong voice(s) and professional skills of playing the instruments... :-)</p>
<p>Thus I would highly appreciate your support and if the perks don't touch your interest, but you still like what I am doing, so tell it to your friends, share it on the social media and so on... thank you!</p>

<h3>As Long As I'm Alive</h3>
<p>My name is Jonathan Robinson and I've been fortunate enough to make a living as a musician for quite a while now. Although I've always written songs and had side projects, I've mostly been a lead guitar player for up and coming artists over the years and that's a role I've enjoyed. But now it's time to release a record of my own and get out on the road as a solo artist. The title track, As Long As I'm Alive, expresses exactly what I want to say with this EP. As long as I'm alive I want to make this music with the sounds of slide guitar, extended jams, raw emotion,and lyrics that tell a story and connect with real people who have real hopes, real dreams, and real problems. </p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">How you can help</span></h3>
<p>I've been working on recording these songs since last October. Some of it was done in Nashville, but I ended up doing a lot of it not far from my hometown in rural NC. The results were so good that the project has become bigger than my initial vision and it seems wrong not to put out the best quality product I possibly can. The songs have been tracked, but I still need to have them mastered, order the physical merchandise, including CDs, vinyl, t-shirts, hats, and stickers, pay for marketing and web design, and I need capital to help pay for transportation for a band as well as all the other expenses of getting out and playing until the project is actually making money. When you contribute, you're pre-ordering the music in whatever medium you want (digital, CD, Vinyl, or all 3), as well as hats and t-shirts. Hopefully, we'll meet our goal of $10,000, but if we don't the priority will be paying for mastering and merchandise. There will also be an intimate performance in NC that early/top contributors will be invited to. I'll also be releasing live videos and content on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram as the campaign runs. As well as pre-ordering, you can help immensely by sharing the campaign and helping to spread the word on social media!! We'd also love to hear from you about venues you'd like to see us play in your cities and towns throughout the country. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Thank you for checking out my Indiegogo Campaign! Here are a few things about me, and what I am trying to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a Hip-Hop artist based out of Columbia South Carolina</li>
<li>This campaign is for the production of the song ""Believer"". I hope to spread hope through music, and to inspire feel-good vibes for anyone listening.</li>
<li>By contributing to this project you will help to kick-start feel-good hip-hop! This would introduce this concept to industry level contacts that I hope will partner to further this movement.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The fund goal is $3,000. Here is a little more information on where the money is going.</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,000 is going toward the production right off the bat. This goes to pay for the folks in Nashville to produce the song, pay for studio time, and involve any other artists that work with them.</li>
<li>The other $1,000 will go toward any travel to and from Nashville (if possible), paying any studio time for myself in SC, and any other mishaps or unforeseen problems that I can't afford to pay out of my personal finances.</li>
<li>Suggested donation levels are $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $200, and $500. </li>
<li>Any funds raised above the goal will be used to finance future projects!</li>

The other $1,000 will go toward any travel to and from Nashville (if possible), paying any studio time for myself in SC, and any other mishaps or unforeseen problems that I can't afford to pay out of my personal finances.
Suggested donation levels are $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, $200, and $500. 
Any funds raised above the goal will be used to finance future projects!

<p>     Hello! Isaiah Ross here; frontman and lead guitarist of Jack Swing. Jack Swing is a band that has moved nonstop since our formation in 2016; steadily rising from Pittsburgh basements to the main stage at every festival in the area. Since 2016 Jack Swing has released three EP's, all being released to exponentially more excitement than the last. Our most recent EP, Get What's Mine For You made a huge splash during this pandemic, gaining over 20k listens on Spotify alone and the leading music video approaching 20k Youtube views. Jack Swing has made it clear that we are here for the long haul. </p>
<p>      We have been extremely busy during this pandemic. Living together during this time has been a blessing. We hunkered down and carefully constructed our debut full length record and are confident that it is our strongest piece of work yet. The older I've become, the more concerned I've become with doing things the right way and to do this record the right way, we need your help. </p>
<p>     Jack Swing has become a Pittsburgh staple and we would have it no other way. Whether it's hearing us on your radio on the ride home or at a Steeler's game, we want our music to continue to be a part of your lives. These songs are our undoubtedly our best material and it is crucial to their integrity that we record them the right way. Your donation will go directly towards helping us do just that. This is a record that will bring everyone along with it. As Pittsburgh finally has gained some musical spotlight we want to help shift the musical narrative of this city  because there are so many incredible artists here who deserve recognition. This record will continue to shift that narrative towards Pittsburgh being recognized as the music city that it truly is. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     This campaign will directly assist with funding the recording and mastering of Jack Swing's debut full length album, as well as assist with marketing and funding of visual content to promote the album. Recording, mixing, and mastering this album will cost roughly $10,000 which is where we will set our goal. </p>
<p>     We have created a tier perk system within which perks range from unique and exciting Jack Swing merchandise to a personal song written for the donor by myself to be uploaded to a unique Bandcamp album. Donations of $150 or more will automatically pre-order a physical copy of the album when physical copies are available as gain early access to special recordings such as demos of the record before they are publicly released. </p>
<p>     If we do not reach our entire goal all the funds will still go directly towards the creation and promotion of the album. While we need your help to make this album what it should be we will still do whatever necessary to make it according to our standards regardless of reaching the goal. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     This record is one that needs to be made. I know what it feels like to be saved by music, to be rescued from a dark time by art that resonates with you, to be inspired to be the best version of yourself from an outside force. I honed these feelings with each Jack Swing release and confidently present them on this record. This is a time for songs of light, inspiration, and empowerment, which is exactly what this album turned out to be. Coming out of this tumultuous year music and art will be crucial in reassembling our culture and this is a record that should be at the forefront of said transition. Jack Swing has always had a way of bringing all types of people together, an energy that this record carries, and the we will undoubtedly need as we attempt to move forward from a  year with so many unforeseen challenges.  Jack Swing has gotten to this level because we believe in music. Music that reflects passion, collaboration, dedication to the craft, and innovation. I started this band because I felt the music I was surrounded by lacked these things and I attribute the success that we have had to sticking true to ourselves and these themes. I believe its time for rock music to get with the times, and this record is one step in that direction. </p>
<p>     As previously stated, each Jack Swing release has been met with exponentially more excitement than the last. We finally are at the point where we know how to both create the record that we intend to, as well as get it to the people that need to hear it. We have gotten to this point because we truly believe in music that reflects dedication to the craft, innovation, and collaboration. It has taken years of trial and error as it does to grow confident in any craft but through that trial and error comes true confidence and with true confidence I can say to you with your help with we can truly make something special. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks when starting a project of this magnitude. What if the band breaks up? What if the record flops? I'm sure you've seen examples of these, I myself have lived them and have made every decision with all of my past experiences in mind. Jack Swing has moved at a steady but careful pace and I wanted to wait to create this record until a few things were certain; I needed Jack Swing to be a team, one that would understand my vision and see it through to the end. The lineup now consists of myself and the people that I have been playing music with the longest in my life, my closest friends, and people that I would trust not only with my life, but with my grooves. After playing live music for over 10 years you begin to identify what it takes to create a true foundation. Every step taken in this band has been done with the intention of building that foundation into something powerful, something that is not going anywhere anytime soon. </p>
</div><div>
<p>We completely understand if you cannot help financially as it is a tough time for all of us! There are still ways that you can be involved: </p>
<ol>
<li>Help us out by sharing the campaign around on social media!</li>
<li>Head to our Bandcamp and purchase one of our tapes and listen with a friend!</li>

<h3><strong>Welcome!</strong></h3>
<p>Hola mi gente! My name is Reina Mar and I am a Latin Pop artist from New Jersey!</p>
<p>I'll first start off saying, I think this past year was pretty insane! There were definitely a lot of set backs during the pandemic, but I think we could all say there were some positive breakthroughs and situations that have come out of it. One of those positive breakthroughs for me, was being able to focus on creating my original music and really diving deep into my style &amp; sound as an artist.  </p>
<p>I am so blessed to say I was able to release my very first debut latin pop single called ""Novela"" last March! Novela means the world to me because it was not only my first song, but a song that truly expressed my latin culture &amp;  helped me discover different parts of me artistically that I never thought I had. Novela also paved the way for me artistically and led me to create my debut EP! I am so blessed that Novela has become the most popular song off of the EP and continues to grow and bring in so many opportunities for my music career.</p>
<h3><strong>The Opportunity </strong></h3>
<p>I'm so blessed to say, I have been granted with an opportunity to bring ""Novela"" to main stream radio and produce my very first music video with one of the finest NYC videographers Aresmendi Merejo from AD Media Films!</p>
<p>Since I am an unsigned artist, it has been extremely difficult to be able to back myself thus far and it continues to get harder as more opportunities come. This is why I need your help and support! Donating any amount(small or large)to this campaign, will give me that extra push to bring my career to the next level and expose Novela across the globe! <strong>NO AMOUNT IS TOO SMALL!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Details On Project Expenses:</strong></h3>
<p>Here is the approximate break down in what is needed for both projects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Radio Campaign to Bring Novela onto main stream Radio is: $3,000</li>
<li>Music Video shot &amp; directed by AdMedia Films: $5,000</li>
</ol>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>Videography/Post Production: $2,500</li>
<li>Hair/Make Up: $350</li>
<li>​Wardrobe/Styling : $800</li>
<li>Dancers/ Choreagrapher/Actors: $600</li>
<li>Locations/Permits:  $700</li>
<li>Props/Set: $100</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Approximate Total: $8,000</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Different Levels of Giving</strong></h3>
<p>I have created different levels of giving that include awesome perks! You do NOT have to choose a ""perk' in order to contribute. They are simply available for me to be able to give something back to you for your generosity. I just appreciate your kindness and willingness to be a part of this! </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
</div><div>It is 100% understandable if you can't contribute at this time, but there are definitely other ways you could help! You could go stream my music on any platform of you choice or spread the word about my Indiegogo by sharing the campaign! This would still be a HUGE help to me!</div><div>

<p>Like most of you, life changed drastically for Roxy Roca starting in March 2020. All of the momentum we'd built from years of making music vanished overnight as shows, tours, and the music industry itself faced widespread cancellations.  Our plans to write music, rehearse, record, and perform were abruptly put on hold with the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic.  Flash forward nearly a year and a half later and we are finally ready to start making moves as a band once again.</p>
<p>Throughout Roxy Roca's 10+ years of playing, our fans have always been the lifeblood and biggest motivator of the band.  We have amazing fans here in Texas, across the US, and around the world, and because of that we've got no plans of packing it in and calling it a day.  But for the first time ever, we do need some help going forward, so we are asking for your support!</p>
<p>It's no secret that recording and promoting an album is an expensive endeavor.  Tracking, mixing, mastering, pressing, replication, publicity, advertising, touring expenses.  These things add up QUICKLY.  In the past, we've always been able to foot the bill ourselves by playing shows, but COVID-19 shattered those plans and we've got to find another way.</p>
<p>We have a handful of demos written and an excellent team at Edgewater Music Group lined up to help lead us through the process of creating something great for you--all we need now is that extra push to help us achieve those goals.</p>
<p>Take a look at the perks we have on offer in exchange for your support.  If you're a fan of our music, we want to give you unprecedented access and rewards in exchange for your support of this new initiative to help the band come back stronger than ever!</p>
</div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>Any campaign like this comes with a certain amount of risk.  We're still in the midst of a global pandemic, and it has not been kind to the music industry.  But the biggest risk we face is that the project doesn't get funded and this new record won't get made.  If you can help us with that part, we promise to take it the rest of the way and deliver you guys with unforgettable music that we know you'll enjoy!</p></div>","Like most of you, life changed drastically for Roxy Roca starting in March 2020.

<p>I have been performing full-time for over 10 years.  If you aren't familiar with my style or music from my first album ""Painting You Gone"", you may know me from a pianobar or that girl that plays keytar.    I continue to have over 200 dates a year in pianobars all over the U.S. and the world.   I sing, play piano and other instruments in a high energy show.  If you know pianobars, you know what I do!  I love my life!<br/></p>
<p>These 7 songs on this album were selected for me by my Nashville Creative Director and former 
16-year ASCAP Executive and music industry veteran Herky Williams as well as my legendary manager Butch Stone.   The writers on these songs are some of the best writers in history.  <br/></p>
<p>This
 title track ""Ain't My Baby Grand"" couldn't be more perfect for me and 
my brand.  Think Ray Charles on keys meets Bonnie Raitt vocals. <br/></p>
<p>I'm currently an independent artist and have managed myself for years but I'm on the verge of a big break with my new management and team in Nashville!   <br/></p>
<p>I can only do it with YOUR HELP!  Today's music industry allows artists like me to reach YOU my fans and followers to ultimately achieve financial goals to in turn reach our artistic goals and aspirations. <br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>If I raise the money I've targeted, I will achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish ""Ain't My Baby Grand"" recording, mix, master and have album shrink wrapped and ready for distribution.</li>
<li>Complete a PHOTOSHOOT with a famous celebrity photorapher for my album cover art.<br/>
</li>
<li>Hire Nashville's finest musicians and throw one heck of a NASHVILLE SHOWCASE in October 2015 for music label exec's to attend.  eek!!!<br/>
</li>
<li>Hire a MARKETING &amp; PRESS FIRM to get the exposure I need to labels and the masses.</li>
<li>AND......shoot
 a MUSIC VIDEO.  Music videos are a very important of an artist's 
development and I already have the creative vision in mind!</li>
</ul> I'm
 an artist on many levels.  My art (paintings/drawings) and graphic design can be seen on my 
website <a href=""http://www.susanerwin.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.susanerwin.com.</a>  I've done all my web and marketing design and CD art on all projects.  <br/><br/><b>CHECK OUT THESE PERKS I CAME UP WITH!</b><br/><ul>
<li>I'm offering the obvious album downloads, signed CDs, posters, tshirts, and more</li>
<li>...but the COOLEST?  My original artwork.  I'm a watercolor and pen artist.  I have sold over 75 paintings in the last year.  My success began during my first Indiegogo campaign and now my art is ALL OVER THE WORLD!</li>
<li>I've also got a studio visit, home or skype motivational visit, at-home concert, and more!</li>
<li>.....Scroll and click on PERKS in this campaign to read more!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Where will funds go if $30,000 isn't reached?</b><br/></p>
<ul> <li>If I don't reach the entire goal, I will have to choose what money I've raised to apply to the most important milestones, such as CD completion first, then press firm, then music video... something similar to that.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>Your contribution makes you a part of my self-made grassroots artistry in today's challenging music industry.  You get to be a part of my success and ability to bring good music to the world. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>I've been honing my performance craft for over 10 years.  They say it's a slow burn to the top and an overnight success is 15 years in the making...well I'm ripe and ready!  <br/><br/>
</li> <li>My first album put me on the map as a legitimate original singer/songwriter in Nashville.  I was successful with my fanbase and through my growth in that project, I'm coming to you with the next step on my dream ladder of success.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I know people value the transparency and behind the scenes look at what goes down in projects like these.  I've worked to mitigate any risks and obstacles I may face on the way to achieving this goal primarily by having a steady income stream from former and current venue and merch sales.  <br/></p>
<p>The following shows the resources needed in today's market to ""break"" an artist like me.  Keep in mind, music labels break artists for no less than $200,000.  I'm doing it with you for less but it still is A LOT of money for me at this point in my career.  I need your help!</p>
<ul> <li>Creative Director fees<br/>
</li>
<li>Management fees<br/>
</li>
<li>Producer fees</li>
<li>Studio Musician fees (the best of Nashville's music row!)<br/>
</li>
<li>Mix Engineer fees</li>
<li>Mastering fees<br/>

<li>Social media and web development resources</li>
<li>Live venue band fees</li>
<li>Merchandise creator fees</li>
<li>....there's more but you get the point I'm sure!</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't realize the first time I did this what all it entails until I went through it.  I've learned so much!  <br/></p>

</li> <li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li> </ul> </div> </div>","Short Summary Hello!  I am a performing and recording artist on my second album project in Nashville, TN.  I did this once successfully on my first album and I'm reaching out to you again to continue our momentum with my second 7-song EP album titled ""Ain't My Baby Grand"".    
I have been performing full-time for over 10 years.  If you aren't familiar with my style or music from my first album ""Painting You Gone"", you may know me from a pianobar or that girl that plays keytar.    I continue to have over 200 dates a year in pianobars all over the U.S. and the world.   I sing, play piano and other instruments in a high energy show.  If you know pianobars, you know what I do!  I love my life!
These 7 songs on this album were selected for me by my Nashville Creative Director and former 
16-year ASCAP Executive and music industry veteran Herky Williams as well as my legendary manager Butch Stone.   The writers on these songs are some of the best writers in history.  
This
 title track ""Ain't My Baby Grand"" couldn't be more perfect for me and 
my brand.  Think Ray Charles on keys meets Bonnie Raitt vocals. 
I'm currently an independent artist and have managed myself for years but I'm on the verge of a big break with my new management and team in Nashville!   
I can only do it with YOUR HELP!  Today's music industry allows artists like me to reach YOU my fans and followers to ultimately achieve financial goals to in turn reach our artistic goals and aspirations.

  What We Need & What You Get 
If I raise the money I've targeted, I will achieve the following:

Finish ""Ain't My Baby Grand"" recording, mix, master and have album shrink wrapped and ready for distribution.
Complete a PHOTOSHOOT with a famous celebrity photorapher for my album cover art.

Hire Nashville's finest musicians and throw one heck of a NASHVILLE SHOWCASE in October 2015 for music label exec's to attend.  eek!!!

Hire a MARKETING & PRESS FIRM to get the exposure I need to labels and the masses.
AND......shoot
 a MUSIC VIDEO.  Music videos are a very important of an artist's 
development and I already have the creative vision in mind!
 I'm
 an artist on many levels.  My art (paintings/drawings) and graphic design can be seen on my 
website www.susanerwin.com.  I've done all my web and marketing design and CD art on all projects.  CHECK OUT THESE PERKS I CAME UP WITH!
I'm offering the obvious album downloads, signed CDs, posters, tshirts, and more
...but the COOLEST?  My original artwork.  I'm a watercolor and pen artist.  I have sold over 75 paintings in the last year.  My success began during my first Indiegogo campaign and now my art is ALL OVER THE WORLD!
I've also got a studio visit, home or skype motivational visit, at-home concert, and more!
.....Scroll and click on PERKS in this campaign to read more!


Where will funds go if $30,000 isn't reached?
 If I don't reach the entire goal, I will have to choose what money I've raised to apply to the most important milestones, such as CD completion first, then press firm, then music video... something similar to that.
    The Impact  Your contribution makes you a part of my self-made grassroots artistry in today's challenging music industry.  You get to be a part of my success and ability to bring good music to the world. 


 I've been honing my performance craft for over 10 years.  They say it's a slow burn to the top and an overnight success is 15 years in the making...well I'm ripe and ready!  
 My first album put me on the map as a legitimate original singer/songwriter in Nashville.  I was successful with my fanbase and through my growth in that project, I'm coming to you with the next step on my dream ladder of success.
    Risks & Challenges I know people value the transparency and behind the scenes look at what goes down in projects like these.  I've worked to mitigate any risks and obstacles I may face on the way to achieving this goal primarily by having a steady income stream from former and current venue and merch sales.  
The following shows the resources needed in today's market to ""break"" an artist like me.  Keep in mind, music labels break artists for no less than $200,000.  I'm doing it with you for less but it still is A LOT of money for me at this point in my career.  I need your help!
 Creative Director fees

Management fees

Producer fees
Studio Musician fees (the best of Nashville's music row!)

Mix Engineer fees
Mastering fees

Art and Photography fees (I do my own art but obviously need a photographer)

CD print and burning for distribution

Press & Marketing fees
Music video storyboard developer, videography and editing fees

Social media and web development resources
Live venue band fees
Merchandise creator fees
....there's more but you get the point I'm sure!

I didn't realize the first time I did this what all it entails until I went through it.  I've learned so much!  
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but you can still help me by sharing this on your social media sites.  That would mean just as much!  Let's cause a RUCKUS and make some noise about my campaign on your social media accounts!

<p>We have been incredibly blessed this past year with so many 
opportunities, experiences, and connections we can't even count. Our 
band has been growing exponentially. So much so that we are ready to get
 on the road and as Rafael is always saying, 'Take it to the next 
Level'! We are so excited to announce that this October The Rafael 
Tranquilino Band will going on our longest tour stretch of all! FOUR 
WEEKS and  FOUR STATES, It's the  much anticipated 'Music Without Borders' 
TOUR!! </p>
<p>We have the connections. We have the dates booked. We have
 the album recorded...but there are a few things that we still need to 
make this trip possible and successful...and the need is pretty big...</p>
<p>We need a touring vehicle that can fit four-six people, a lightweight travel trailer or camper, and merchandise to sell.</p>
<p>Touring
 is absolutely essential to the success of an artist, especially for 
independent artists. Unfortunately touring without major label support 
can be really limiting (we can only play where the budget includes 
lodging for the band) , expensive (fast food/dining out,hotels, 
gas...etc), and even dangerous (relying on 'friends of friends of 
friends' for a place to stay between shows). If we are able to pull our 
lodging with us there will never be a concern about whether or not we 
can afford the hotel at the next stop or be crashing on someone's pool 
table. This also means that we can save on food and eat healthier. A 
kitchen, even a mini kitchen means we can buy groceries and prepare food
 for ourselves. The other really exciting plus is that if we are 
completely self contained we can afford to go to the small towns and 
play for venues that maybe can afford to pay us but can't put us up. We 
don't need something new and fancy. There are tons of great deals on used campers 
and travel trailers on Craigslist and at dealerships online and on site!</p>
<p>The other side to the travel aspect is the vehicle to haul the trailer! Nothing fancy, and again it doesn't have to be new. We are looking at low mileage pre-owned minivans. Something similar to a  Dodge Grand Caravan. The few times we have needed to rent a vehicle for regional touring the Dodge Grand Caravan has been perfect! Fits the whole band in one car, tons of cargo space for all the gear, doesn't kill you on gas mileage, and has enough power to haul the small trailer we need!</p>
<p>Lastly but just as importantly we desperately need high quality merchandise to sell! We have all the artistic materials; albums recorded but unable to duplicate, t-shirt and poster designs ready to be put to press, we just need the funds to do it! Oh and P.S. that merchandise DOUBLES as the perks listed for this campaign!! You get a piece of the action too!!<br/></p>
<p>Owning a trailer and understanding what it truly means to travel with one can be a daunting task. Even knowing how to drive a car with a trailer is tricky. However we are very fortunate to have veteran traveling musicians who use similar set-ups who are able and willing to help teach us all the ins and outs of trailer travel. You can know that whatever equipment you help us to purchase will be well maintained and operated safely. We are also fortunate to have friends in the car business and maintenance industries who are able to help us with choosing the right vehicle as well. <br/></p>
<p>We know that this is a big need and a big ask. We would just like you to know that by helping us achieve this goal you are not just investing in a one time opportunity. You are directly affecting our future and success for years to come. These are two literal vehicles to success! Having reliable touring equipment will enable us to tour regularly across the country throughout the year without the extras stress, expense and limitations. Please consider donating to our campaign. Every single dollar helps! If you are unable to donate, no worries. Please forward and share this campaign to anyone that you think may be interested and able to help us on our way,... and keep listening to the music! We appreciate and love all of you! Thank you so much for your continued support and God willing with your help we will see you on the road!!</p>

The other side to the travel aspect is the vehicle to haul the trailer! Nothing fancy, and again it doesn't have to be new. We are looking at low mileage pre-owned minivans. Something similar to a  Dodge Grand Caravan. The few times we have needed to rent a vehicle for regional touring the Dodge Grand Caravan has been perfect! Fits the whole band in one car, tons of cargo space for all the gear, doesn't kill you on gas mileage, and has enough power to haul the small trailer we need!
Lastly but just as importantly we desperately need high quality merchandise to sell! We have all the artistic materials; albums recorded but unable to duplicate, t-shirt and poster designs ready to be put to press, we just need the funds to do it! Oh and P.S. that merchandise DOUBLES as the perks listed for this campaign!! You get a piece of the action too!!
Owning a trailer and understanding what it truly means to travel with one can be a daunting task. Even knowing how to drive a car with a trailer is tricky. However we are very fortunate to have veteran traveling musicians who use similar set-ups who are able and willing to help teach us all the ins and outs of trailer travel. You can know that whatever equipment you help us to purchase will be well maintained and operated safely. We are also fortunate to have friends in the car business and maintenance industries who are able to help us with choosing the right vehicle as well. 
We know that this is a big need and a big ask. We would just like you to know that by helping us achieve this goal you are not just investing in a one time opportunity. You are directly affecting our future and success for years to come. These are two literal vehicles to success! Having reliable touring equipment will enable us to tour regularly across the country throughout the year without the extras stress, expense and limitations. Please consider donating to our campaign. Every single dollar helps! If you are unable to donate, no worries. Please forward and share this campaign to anyone that you think may be interested and able to help us on our way,... and keep listening to the music! We appreciate and love all of you! Thank you so much for your continued support and God willing with your help we will see you on the road!!

<h3>""Finer Things"" will mark my first full studio album with songs that reflect what I have been though these last few years.

<p>Let me start by telling you that music is a part of me.  It is what I need to do with my life and now I've spent years working on my craft to show it to you and ask for you to jump in while the iron is hot.</p>
<p>The way something is made popular is by repetition and reach, which is done by Marketing, promotions, and public relations.   If you fund this crowdfunding campaign, it will give us the resources needed to do these things INDEPENDENTLY!  The world of music has changed so much and with so much music for free, it is very difficult to push over the top and monetize, which I am so close to making happen.  This campaign will put my career into the position to make money making music and continue to provide that to my fans.</p>

<h3>WHO ARE BEARS FOR YEARS?</h3>
<p><strong>Hello &amp; Welcome! We are Bears For Years, your very own Boston based jazzy folk-rock duo, and this is our story...</strong></p>
<p>Bears For Years began as a songwriting collaboration and in-studio project between Boston-area musicians Gina Monafo and Patrick S. Barry in late 2013. Over the course of the following few years we had written enough songs for a full album and began work on our debut <i>Ursa Major</i> in August of 2016. The record, which is being engineered and produced at Watch City Studios by Joel Simches, features Monafo and Barry covering nearly all vocals and instrumentation, accompanied by Joel Silloway (The Life Electric) on drums. Bears For Years have also been taking their music to the stage, along with Mr. Silloway and bassist Matt Ohanian (Daeves).</p>
<p>We like to think of our sound as a blend of jazz and folk, with elements of wistful pop and dark prog rock undertones. Working with a live rhythm section has inspired us by injecting a sense of raw excitement into our sound, something we hope to achieve on <i>Ursa Major</i>. Joel Simches, whose work within the Boston community as both producer and musician is prolific, brings years of experience and creative empathy to the production of this record . With basic tracks completed, we cannot wait dig in and finish this up!</p>
<p><strong>The album and songs are halfway done! We've got the drums, bass, and basic acoustic guitar and keyboard tracks completed, now for the finishing touches...</strong></p>
<h3><strong>WHY ARE WE MAKING THIS RECORD?</strong></h3>
<p><b>A professional representation of our sound is key to our success. This will greatly impact our ability to spread our sound and reach a wider audience.</b></p>
<p>Having a quality, but also genuine, representation of one's music is crucial for any musician/band. We put so much work into the composition and arrangement of our songs, and it's important to us that we can give this album a fully fledged studio treatment that will bring the songs to life. We have done so much in the way of home recording for demos and other projects, and we feel this album deserves better than what we can produce ourselves on a low budget or at home. We want to represent our music in the best light, the light it deserves. After hearing how the basic tracks came out, we feel it was well worth the initial investment and can't wait to finish recording the album!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>CAMPAIGN BREAKDOWN</h3>
<p><strong>Here’s everything we need and how much it goes for:</strong></p>
<p><u>Studio Time</u> ~ 3days@$450ea= $1,350 - to record the remaining parts: vocals, electric guitar, keyboard/synth, auxilliary percussion</p>
<p><u>Mixing</u> ~$150 x 10 songs= $1,500 - Each track will be mixed to create the best sounding balance of instrumentation, volume, dynamics, effects, etc. This is where the magic happens.</p>

Crazy right!?<br/>Well after nearly a year of writing and scrapping songs and sounds, I have finally put together a cohesive album that I am really excited to share with you! I call it ≠ - Not Equal.</p><p>This record is not for the clubs. Rather, it is music to get you through the cold harsh months of winter stuck inside and get you ready for the lovely spring and summer months. It is electronic music that bares my passion and soul. You will not find vocals on this record, it is purely an instrumental album to vibe out to.... ≠ is Music. <br/><br/><strong>-Copyright Game Changer</strong><br/>Not Equal will be released under an atribution Share-Alike Creative Commons Copyright License... what the heck does that mean? Let me explain!<br/>It's of my opinion that art is never finished and music is art. If you are a singer and would like to sing over top of something on this album and release it, please feel free. If you are a producer and would like to remix something on this album, Please do so freely! IF you are a band and want to cover something on this and record it? Go Right ahead! The copyright on this will allow you to remix, cover or elaborate on this body of work and make something new! All I ask is that you simply credit me then create something timeless and beautiful!<br/><br/><strong>-You have already written the record, why the Indiegogo?</strong><br/>Well, I have spent countless hours writing and mixing this record with Producer Quinn Danielis (Death Cohen, Japain, Vibes)  who has done all of the mixing for absolutely free.<br/>While the actual writing and mixing process has only cost me a few thousand dollars over the span of a year, Mastering and Packaging are upon me and that stuff costs a ton of dough!

My original songs will be accompanied by an accomplished singer Mary Gaby Perales Betancourt as well as other world class instrumentalists (guitar, accordion, bass, violin, trumpet, percussion…).    This project will allow my life mission  of spreading soulful music around the world to become a reality. By contributing to Oceans of the Night you are helping me realize this lifetime dream and you will get to listen to some breathtaking music! BEING PART OF OCEANS OF THE NIGHT     If you choose to back me, I have some fantastic perks to reward you with such as free DRM  downloads (DRM free means there are no restrictions on your music so you can play or copy it as many times as you wish), CD's, the DVD of the inaugural concert, songs that I can write just for you and lots more coming!BREAKDOWN OF WHAT WE'VE SPENTWe have begun recording bass, violin, trumpet, and the percussion parts of 10 of the songs.  Here is a breakdown of what I have already invested in the project thus far:· Engineer  $800  · Musicians (bass, violin, trumpet, percussion) $2120 · Indiegodo team  $290   OBSTACLES TO OVERCOMEThis project is a large undertaking and requires the necessary funds to complete it in the best possible way. If I do not reach my goal I will record fewer songs as to not compromise the quality of the music.  I am very dedicated to this album and no matter what I am committed to offering a finished product of the best possible quality. I have been writing songs for over 16 years. In the past I recorded and co-produced an album of all original music. I have organised  and performed  many concerts  both of my original songs and famous classics in French, English and Spanish.  As a music and language teacher I have done multiple creative projects with my students such as plays, short films and art projects. With this  new undertaking I bring together all the skills I have built upon over the years.  If financially contributing is not within your reach, then we would love you to participate in other ways! Here are some suggestions: IMPACTOceans of the Night has the possibility to take off on an international level spreading elevating and exciting music across the globe! FrancaisCampagne pour l'album Oceans of the Night (Océans de la nuit)Je voudrais t'inviter à te joindre une campagne de musique du monde.

<p><strong>Hi, I'm Tony Natale, </strong>USA born drummer/composer.  My new album ""The Camden Promise"" is completely written, recorded and mixed. It's new music that inspirers, enlightens and uplifts the listener.  I now need to pay for mastering and packaging of the CD. I would like to have 1000 or more CD copies printed up. I need money to hire a team of promoters to get my music into places I cannot, worldwide. I will also need to rehearse and prepare my band 'Turnhip"" for touring. Last, I would need funds to begin a tour, performing this music with my band worldwide. I know this is not enough funds to promote a worldwide tour, but certainly enough to prepare the promotion, CD packaging and band for the tour. Touring should bring profits of it's own. The tour most likely will start in the USA my home land, or Germany, then hopefully proceed to Brazil and wherever good opportunity's arise. </p>
