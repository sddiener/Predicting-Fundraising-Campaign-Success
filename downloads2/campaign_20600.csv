Theatre is excited to announce its next production, TALES IN CRUX, which will be performed at CBC Studios in Vancouver from May 23-28th, 2014.</p><p><b>WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE’RE DOING:</b></p><p>In Tales in Crux, the audience is greeted by two characters, half-MCs, half-characters, who guide you through their personal collection of stories as they unfold.  Travelling across five different brand new plays, this is a festival that weaves a ‘framing’ story in and out and between four ‘inner stories’, pulling the audience from world to world, past and future,through the happiness and horrors of 20-something life, right into in an immersive and surprising theatrical experience.

Theatre is excited to announce its next production, TALES IN CRUX, which will be performed at CBC Studios in Vancouver from May 23-28th, 2014.WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE’RE DOING:In Tales in Crux, the audience is greeted by two characters, half-MCs, half-characters, who guide you through their personal collection of stories as they unfold.

STORY AND INSPIRATION!
In
September 2010, six CalArts students joined together to embark on a
collaborative adventure that would grow to become ""Inflated Ego!""
and send them to the Prague Quadrennial.   
 
The Prague
Quadrennial is an
international exhibition of performance and design that occurs only every four years. Once selected to perform as one
of the Street Stories in the exhibition, the members of Inflated Ego! were
thrilled to take this unique opportunity to represent CalArts in this community
of artists. (check it out: http://www.pq.cz/en/)
 
Our
initial idea stemmed from this context of being American students in
an international
exhibition. After
various incarnations we engaged in a surprising but illuminating play with cardboard
boxes. Our performance begins with one large Power Box, which is
alive revealing only feet beneath the imposing angular structure. This
character defines the performance space in a busy public square where
unassuming audience members then curiously investigate and are pressured to
become Boxed Citizens in the world of the Power Box. This iconic and
simple object allowed us to create a universal language to illustrate the challenging perception of America by both
ourselves and the international media. 
 
THE IMPACT!
It is our hope to explore the concept of a national
identity as two different entities- a standard to live by and a manufactured
perception. While the media and international community hold many valid and
truthful opinions about the actions and values of American people, we as
Americans have often felt misrepresented in our giant fishbowl. In this tricky
tug of war we are hoping not to identify a specific power through our Power Box
character, bur rather to discuss the manipulation of individuals by way of
packaging, ritual and persuasion. 
 
HOW YOU CAN HELP!
As
both co-creators and performers for this piece all six of us must travel
to Prague, which is our largest and most important expense. At about $1400.00
each, this totals to at least a whopping $8400.00. 
 
Our materials
are another cost to be considered, including shipping overseas. In addition to
our boxes we have manufactured personalized harnesses and rigs for each device,
a pregnant belly, umbilical cording, masks and varying costume elements. These
materials that were used in rehearsal and those for our performance add up to
the remaining cost of $1200.00. 
 
CalArts
has generously funded our housing fees, but that is a small part of our larger
expenses at hand.
 
Since
our performance will be abroad and most of you, our friends, peers and fellow
artists will not be able to join us we ask you for your support here! Any amount of donation from you, your friends, your pets
is one step closer to us funding our project now.  
 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP!
Come
see us perform if you are in Prague on June 17, 2011!!

<h3><strong>The Lowdown</strong></h3>
<p>Hello all and welcome to my page!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> What we have here is an opportunity to uplift individuals and their communities, strengthen the bonds in those communities, give youth a positive outlet, inspire folks to strive for what they love, and to share the knowledge that we here in the US are surrounded by and may take for granted, with those less privileged. Through what medium you ask is all this possible? Through the medium of dance!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Since 2007 New Image Productions has been holding tours throughout the different provinces of the Philippines, hosting dance events and free workshops, to promote and share the culture of hip hop, with bboying being a main focus. This coming May will mark their six year anniversary and the biggest tour to date, LEGACY 6. With your help, I will be able to be a part of this trip and will be documenting the whole tour!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> This past January, I was fortunate enough to be able to embark on a similar journey to Vietnam and the Philippines, with an organization called All The Way Live (ATWL). We focused on teaching underprivileged, at risk youth, reaching out to their local communities, as well as helping to build their dance communities and scenes. I dance myself but for that trip, documentation was my main focus, which is what I will be doing for this upcoming trip in May, LEGACY 6 if I'm able to meet my goals. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> The reach of hip hop has touched the globe. You can see its effects in varying degrees, wherever you go. Often times when it travels outside immediate circles, let alone worldwide, gets snatched up by the corporate world or exploited in any way for profit, it becomes watered down and its true principles become lost. This unfortunately happens with many things. My goal for this trip is to document the stories of these dancers of the Philippines, to see how dance affects them and in what way it adds to their life. The Philippines are rich in song and dance but not many people know that of many countries outside of the US, it's hip hop roots, though young, are strong as well. I want to put this out in the open. People need to know and understand the effects that such an outlet can have in a place like the Philippines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> More than dance though, this trip is about uniting and uplifting people and their communities. Hip Hop is the vehicle. Dance is the specific tool. A very large amount of the population of the Philippines still live lives rampant with problems that would be considered intolerable in the ""first world."" This is their reality and their day to day. Life goes on but when the opportunity arises for change towards a better, more comfortable life or something pops up that aleviates the struggles day in and day out, no doubt folks are drawn to that. Dance is something positive that has that pull. It can give people something to be passionate about and once that passion is ignited, it can translate into all areas of a persons life. For some of these kids it may be something that they eventually grow out of. There's no denying the lasting effect and friendship's it will build though. For other's, this dance, this culture may be the spark that ignites and pushes them to do something great. The important thing is to foster that ability of belief in one's self. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> As someone who enjoyes dancing and who has loved the culture of hip hop for almost all my years, it feels as if it's the duty of myself and all the other individuals that will be on this trip, to nurture this development and spread this knowledge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> I'm no historian or expert on the topic but I know that from its beginnings, Hip Hop has been a grassroots movement, at first uniting small communities and moving outwards from there. It has been a way for people to express themselves who previously had no voice and this in turn gave them a platform to rise up. Dance is a part of this culture. You might not realize it but dance can be much more than something fun to do or something entertaining to watch. It has the power to bring people together.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>  All together, my goal is to raise 2200. A large chunk of this will go towards airfare, about 1500 (SFO-Manilla + interisland flights). Other costs consist of the basics, such as food, lodging, and transportation. If I'm able to meet this goal, my plan was to also purchase roughly 50 Know Your Rank t shirts (approx. 400), which is a popular brand of clothing in the bboy scene and give these away at the workshops and events that we will be going to.</p>
<p> For donation of clothes (shirts, pants, shorts, shoes, hats, etc.), depending on the amount and how much I can fit in my suitcase(s) without going over the weight limit, I will send them to the PI using Balikbayan Boxes, which are about 65 for the large size (24x18x18), via LBC Express. This may not be a factor though. I'll keep everyone updated on this.</p>
<p>I will also be trying to raise money outside of this Indiegogo campaign and will keep you all updated on this as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> All kinds of help are appreciated! Many of us right now are stretching our paychecks to the limit and if financial help is out of reach at this moment, no worries! Positive thoughts, good vibes, and the like are graciously accepted.

Hello all and welcome to my page!
 
 What we have here is an opportunity to uplift individuals and their communities, strengthen the bonds in those communities, give youth a positive outlet, inspire folks to strive for what they love, and to share the knowledge that we here in the US are surrounded by and may take for granted, with those less privileged. Through what medium you ask is all this possible? Through the medium of dance!
 
 Since 2007 New Image Productions has been holding tours throughout the different provinces of the Philippines, hosting dance events and free workshops, to promote and share the culture of hip hop, with bboying being a main focus. This coming May will mark their six year anniversary and the biggest tour to date, LEGACY 6. With your help, I will be able to be a part of this trip and will be documenting the whole tour!
 
 This past January, I was fortunate enough to be able to embark on a similar journey to Vietnam and the Philippines, with an organization called All The Way Live (ATWL). We focused on teaching underprivileged, at risk youth, reaching out to their local communities, as well as helping to build their dance communities and scenes. I dance myself but for that trip, documentation was my main focus, which is what I will be doing for this upcoming trip in May, LEGACY 6 if I'm able to meet my goals. 
 
 


The Impact
 The reach of hip hop has touched the globe. You can see its effects in varying degrees, wherever you go. Often times when it travels outside immediate circles, let alone worldwide, gets snatched up by the corporate world or exploited in any way for profit, it becomes watered down and its true principles become lost. This unfortunately happens with many things. My goal for this trip is to document the stories of these dancers of the Philippines, to see how dance affects them and in what way it adds to their life. The Philippines are rich in song and dance but not many people know that of many countries outside of the US, it's hip hop roots, though young, are strong as well. I want to put this out in the open. People need to know and understand the effects that such an outlet can have in a place like the Philippines.
 
 More than dance though, this trip is about uniting and uplifting people and their communities. Hip Hop is the vehicle. Dance is the specific tool. A very large amount of the population of the Philippines still live lives rampant with problems that would be considered intolerable in the ""first world."" This is their reality and their day to day. Life goes on but when the opportunity arises for change towards a better, more comfortable life or something pops up that aleviates the struggles day in and day out, no doubt folks are drawn to that. Dance is something positive that has that pull. It can give people something to be passionate about and once that passion is ignited, it can translate into all areas of a persons life. For some of these kids it may be something that they eventually grow out of. There's no denying the lasting effect and friendship's it will build though. For other's, this dance, this culture may be the spark that ignites and pushes them to do something great. The important thing is to foster that ability of belief in one's self. 
 
 As someone who enjoyes dancing and who has loved the culture of hip hop for almost all my years, it feels as if it's the duty of myself and all the other individuals that will be on this trip, to nurture this development and spread this knowledge.
 
 I'm no historian or expert on the topic but I know that from its beginnings, Hip Hop has been a grassroots movement, at first uniting small communities and moving outwards from there. It has been a way for people to express themselves who previously had no voice and this in turn gave them a platform to rise up. Dance is a part of this culture. You might not realize it but dance can be much more than something fun to do or something entertaining to watch. It has the power to bring people together.


What We Need & What You Get
  All together, my goal is to raise 2200. A large chunk of this will go towards airfare, about 1500 (SFO-Manilla + interisland flights). Other costs consist of the basics, such as food, lodging, and transportation. If I'm able to meet this goal, my plan was to also purchase roughly 50 Know Your Rank t shirts (approx. 400), which is a popular brand of clothing in the bboy scene and give these away at the workshops and events that we will be going to.
 For donation of clothes (shirts, pants, shorts, shoes, hats, etc.), depending on the amount and how much I can fit in my suitcase(s) without going over the weight limit, I will send them to the PI using Balikbayan Boxes, which are about 65 for the large size (24x18x18), via LBC Express. This may not be a factor though. I'll keep everyone updated on this.
I will also be trying to raise money outside of this Indiegogo campaign and will keep you all updated on this as well.


Other Ways You Can Help
 All kinds of help are appreciated! Many of us right now are stretching our paychecks to the limit and if financial help is out of reach at this moment, no worries! Positive thoughts, good vibes, and the like are graciously accepted. If you have any old clothes (shirts, shoes, pants, hats, etc.), hand me downs are also greatly appreciated and will be donated to the different communities that we visit. Balikbayan boxes! :) If this is something you're passionate about as well, please feel free to share this page with your social networks via Twitter or Facebook.

</div></div>","Compagnia de' Colombari presents: MORE OR LESS I AM
“A small, fortunate audience assembled on the steps of Grant’s Tomb last night for Compagnia de’ Colombari’s penultimate performance of “More Or Less I Am,” an hour of spoken word, song, dance, and music based on Walt Whitman’s 1855 poem “Song of Myself”… For an hour… it felt as though we’d created, audience and performers together, a real community. To risk sounding trite, we’d become Whitman’s Americans living in his America.” – Ian Crouch, The New Yorker (click for more)
Conceived and directed by Karin Coonrod, with
original music by Colin Jacobsen, Kyle Sanna, and Eric Jacobsen. 

Cast members include: Dietrice Bolden, Ayeje

Who We Are

Compagnia de' Colombari is an non-profit,
international theatre company dedicated to celebrating the kinship of humankind
alongside its diversity. Our shows literally bring theatre to the streets of
the city, with site-specific performances in unconventional venues, all
presented to the public free of charge-- Colombari believes that every place is
a space for the sacred architecture of theatre, and that every audience member
brings a unique and important perspective to the communal experience of theatre.

Our name Colombari—referring to the dovecotes
etched high into the cliffs near Orvieto, Italy—speaks to our mission. The
dovecotes, networked one to another against the brutal elements, demonstrate a
synergy between the individual and the collective, a synergy that we aim to
explore, draw upon, and strengthen through our artistry.
 
What We're Doing
MORE OR LESS I AM is a music-theater piece drawn
entirely from Walt Whitman’s 1855 Song of Myself.  Conceived and directed
by Karin Coonrod with original music by Colin Jacobsen, Kyle Sanna and Eric
Jacobsen, the piece involves 16 performers from the Americas: six
instrumentalists, six actor/singers (including David Patrick Kelly, Dietrice Bolden, Michael Rogers and Jorge Rubio), one mezzo soprano, one gospel singer, one child and several members of the audience. The piece is played in site-specific
locations free of charge to its public. 
MORE OR LESS I AM speaks, sings aloud, and embodies
the voice of Walt Whitman, calling on audience members and performers alike to experience our individual greatness and our great
commonality.
Why We're Doing It
MORE OR LESS I AM puts forward the challenge of our very own New York poet--a challenge to be a New Yorker, American, democratic, full. 
From the Director:
"" This anniversary offers New Yorkers an opportunity to re-imagine what it is to be an American, to listen to what our poet laureate wrote when the country was extremely polarized and on the brink of civil war. Whitman's declaration of interdependence is more relevant now than ever. We hope to inspire audiences that even more powerful than our greatness as individuals is our greatness as a group.""
As Whitman says: “I speak the password primeval….I
give the sign of democracy/By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have
their counterpart of on the same terms.” 
What We Need to Do It, and How YOU Can Help
More or Less I Am is partially funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. We need YOU to help complete our funding to mark this important event. Our $4000 goal is aimed at paying our invaluable and deeply talented performers. As a thank you we will send you back a signed program and a special Compagnia de' Colombari bookmark!
Also, since Compagnia de’ Colombari is a non-profit with 501c3 status, all of your donations are tax deductible! Please consider our campaign as one of your donations for the year and help us bring our performances to the public FREE OF CHARGE.
Get the Word Out!
Whether or not you can make a financial
contribution, please PLEASE help us get the word out about our Compagnia and
this fabulous production! Tell your friends by word of mouth, Facebook (Like us? Like us!), Tweet,
Google+, email, snail mail, morse code, smoke signal…

The Show

At once hilarious and heartbreaking, PORTRAIT AND A DREAM rebounds across time and memory, coalescing into a powerful and intensely personal depiction of love, loss and human tragedy. 



Nick’s life is perfect. He loves his job, his girlfriend, their new apartment. But Nick makes a mistake. Then another, and another, until all that remains are shattered pieces. Tormented by regrets and clutching the tattered memories of an irretrievable past, he discovers that life is easy when you’re happy, but when you’re miserable… well, that’s when things get interesting.


The Company

Named for its dedication to the serious and the silly, Cabbages and Kings Theatre Company blends high and low art into a single, vibrant dramatic force that speaks to our world, present and future. Cabbages and Kings invites audiences into our community to help us explore the fundamental challenges—and pleasures—of being human.


Why Support Portrait?

Cabbages and Kings is a new company. It is a small company. But while we don't have huge funding resources, what we do have is an enormous amount of dedication, a gifted team, and a truly magnificent play. Portrait and a Dream speaks to anyone who has ever lost something and not known where to look for it. It speaks to anyone who has ever made a mistake that they couldn't take back.


Producing a show in such a major (and large) theater is a significant challenge but we have undertaken it because we believe that audiences NEED to see this show. However, we cannot do it alone. Without you we have no set. Without you we have no actors, no theater. Without you we cannot share this incredible play with the world.

While FringeNYC helps us keep the costs of this show down, there are some absolute essentials that we cannot do the show without. +Every dollar you give goes to making this beautiful show a reality.

<h3>NEW GOAL of $1100</h3>
<p>Here's what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>I LOVE SPACE! I have always been interested in astronomy, the moon, and how it all works. </li>
<li>This show is important now because we are at a crossroads in space exploration that is leading us towards colonization.</li>
<li>I am an alumnus of the New York Neo-Futurists.

<li>I was awarded an ArtSpark grant of $4435. This will help to get the bare essentials, pay all of my collaborators a stipend, and pay for professional productions photos, which I will use to create a press packet for festival and season submissions. </li>
<li>I have been given 75% of the grant money. I have to put up the last $1100 out of my own money and wait until the fall to be reimbursed with the last 25% of the grant.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Synopsis: Circumstantial evidence and industry jealousy land Chicha, international sensation Chola Bulldyke Fashionista in the slammer. A small kindness alters her view of the world and in the process, self-liberation. Through the use of traditional Latino story telling and multimedia, the audience experiences cultural intersections both with humor and critical insight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Solo Performance Festival in Seattle invites Gerald Alejandro Ford to perform at The Theater Off Jackson, a landmark in Seattle's diversity theater culture. What makes this performance special is that this year only female solo shows are being showcased. The content of the Gerald's show has given him the privilege to play his character Chicha and will be the only male performer in the festival this year. Selection to this show speaks to the talent, sensitivity and celebration of the content. Chicha in a nutshell is the celebration of self-empowerment.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In collaboration with eSe Teatro (a newly formed Latino Theater Collective) the goal for the Solo Festival is to engage audiences in contemporary questions and unlikely material. Gerald wrote Chicha for an expanded audience. His goal is to show the universal questions of being and self-actualization. Moreover, Chicha embodies cross-cultures narratives. As we engage her character, we relate to her in ways never expected. Chicha will make you laugh, cry and think.<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of theatre artists - writers, performers, directors - who feel the effects of immigration every day in our families, friends, and community. We created this play to tell our story and encourage audiences to feel the human aspect of immigration.</p>
<p>This summer, <strong>Ground Floor Theatre</strong> presented the World Premiere of <i><strong>There and Back</strong></i> by <strong>National Latino Playwriting Award</strong> winner <strong>Raul Garza</strong>, to audiences in Austin, TX. We were blown away by the audience reaction, critical reception, and personal feedback from audience members who felt motivated to raise their voices about social justice. Now we have the opportunity to extend <strong><i>There and Back</i></strong>'s impact. And we need your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising $10,000 to share this important message with audiences in Santa Fe, New Mexico at <strong>Teatro Paraguas</strong>. All proceeds raised go directly to offset the expenses of staging the production (set, props, costumes, etc), transportation, lodging, space rental and paying a living wage to the theatre artists and technicians bringing <i><strong>There and Back</strong></i> to life.</p>
<p>Touring a full-length play is technically challenging, but we're committed to giving Santa Fe audiences a full-strength theatre experience. Please help us raise awareness and motivate action regarding immigration policy. <strong>This is a story that must be told.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In <i><strong>There and Back</strong></i>, a young woman travels from Mexico to join her husband on a migrant farmworkers’ camp. Her arrival on President John F. Kennedy’s inauguration day reveals stark contrasts between the American dream and her reality. A series of visits by a liberated Virgen de Guadalupe offers a glimpse of her future, and presents a life-altering choice: stay in the United States as a member of the underclass, or abandon her dream of immigration to claim dignity and fulfillment.</p>
<p><strong>Karina Dominguez</strong>, a bilingual, Austin-trained actor with over 12 years experience in film and theater in Texas, plays Gloria, who travels to the US from Mexico as part of the Bracero Program.  Karina says ""By far the role of Gloria in <i><strong>There and Back</strong></i> has been closest to my heart. To be able to tell the story of a Mexican woman existing in America over the course of her lifetime and to express the struggles, heartbreaks and setbacks she encounters as an unwelcome part of American society has been a cathartic gift"".</p>
<p><strong>Giselle Marie Muñoz</strong>, a proud daughter of immigrants, has a background in dance, studied in New York City and produces short films. She plays La Virgen de Guadalupe and is called upon when Gloria needs her most as a friend, sister and even as a mother. For Giselle, playing La Virgen in <i><strong>There and Back</strong></i>  has lit up her life and has solidified why storytelling is so important as it brings people together, especially when it's needed most.</p>
<p><strong>Mical Trejo</strong> plays all of the men in Gloria's life- her husband Victor, her son Rey, and her grandson Max. Trejo is excited to return to Teatro Paraguas in another piece by <strong>Raul Garza</strong>, having performed Confessions of a MexPatriate in Santa Fe just a few years ago. This story, <i><strong>There and Back</strong><u>,</u><strong> </strong></i>is timely, moving, and important. </p>
<p>This is a story that clarifies a particular myth in U.S. history and humanizes those who have been attacked by hateful rhetoric since that time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to help invest in <i><strong>There and Back</strong></i> financially at this time, that's ok!  You can help us immensely by sharing this campaign with folks you think would be interested and letting friends in Santa Fe know that we are coming!  Performances will be Nov. 8 - 17, 2018 at <strong>Teatro Paraguas </strong>and tickets should be available on their website soon!</p>

<h3>DanceWorks</h3>
<p><em>DanceWorks</em> is a modern dance concert being presented by Melissa West in collaboration with her dance company, MWest and Company, and the Staten Island Dance Jam.</p>
<p>Over the past 6 months, the Staten Island Dance Jam has grown from a small seed of imagination into a weekly group meeting facilitated by Melissa West and Diana Domoracki-Kisto. Diana is currently working on a piece of choreography to present at <em>DanceWorks</em> that includes our lovely dance jam participants of all ages, levels and experiences.</p>
<p>MWest and Company<em> </em>has been working on dances together since 2011. We were recently awarded the Excellence in the Arts grant and commissioned to present a new dance at the LUMEN festival. Our project at LUMEN was a big hit and we continue to make and refine our works for <em>DanceWorks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Melissa West</strong><span> is New Dorp's premiere choreographer. She has curated dance programming as part of Second Saturdays Staten Island; has produced shows at the New Dorp Moravian Church, Hunter College, the Bowery Poetry Club, and various other locations throughout Staten Island, NYC, and the east coast. She loves dance and Staten Island so let's help combine these loves into one amazing presentation!</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Help us put on an incredible show!</h3>
<p>Even though we have received a generous grant from the Council on the Arts and Humanities on Staten Island (funded through the Department of Cultural Affairs), we still need some help to cover production expenses for <em>DanceWorks.</em></p>
<p>We are trying to raise $1000 to help pay our dancers, fund our venue space, aid in rehearsal space rentals, and cover the many production costs for this show. Even if we don't reach our goal, your generous support will help make this show happen. We cannot do it without the backing of our community. Let's help the Staten Island's dance scene grow!</p>
<p>When you help support <em>DanceWorks, </em>you will get some really cool local gifts, tokens of appreciation, from Staten Island artists. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Staten Island has recently seen a surge of activity from local artists, both young and old. With events such as Second Saturdays and the various art events scattered around our borough, we have a hotbed of activity. The Staten Island Dance Jam is a result of this activity and features dancers ranging from 14 years old to 75; these are the faces of Staten Island's diverse population.</p>
<p>When you contribute to projects like this, it helps us plan for future events. It helps us plan to create artistic programming for our community for many years to come. By donating a monetary contribution or volunteering your time, or by showing up to our event, you are keeping the arts alive on Staten Island and we thank you so much for that!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you could donate $5, $10, $20, $100 or more, we'd be forever indebted to you. However, even if you cannot donate a single dollar there are other ways you can help. You can show your support by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offering to volunteer the day of the show. We can always use helping hands to organize, clean, usher, and assist with the production.</li>
<li>Sharing our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, your blog, and through emailing your friends and family.</li>
<li>By spreading the word. Getting people hyped about dance, Staten Island, and the arts is something you can do just by telling people about this show.</li>
<li>Offering any other assistance. We can always use donations of equipment, materials, and other production related things. If you have something you think we can use, just ask/offer! We always return lent items in better condition than they were given to us.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there you have it. This is how you can make a huge impact in your community. Dance is one of the most invaluable forms of communication. Everyone, no matter how old or able, responds to movement and art. Help us put on a great show but even more-- help us foster a community of dancers, thinkers, artists, and all around good folks trying to better Staten Island, NYC, and beyond.</p>

</div></div>","DanceWorks
DanceWorks is a modern dance concert being presented by Melissa West in collaboration with her dance company, MWest and Company, and the Staten Island Dance Jam.
Over the past 6 months, the Staten Island Dance Jam has grown from a small seed of imagination into a weekly group meeting facilitated by Melissa West and Diana Domoracki-Kisto. Diana is currently working on a piece of choreography to present at DanceWorks that includes our lovely dance jam participants of all ages, levels and experiences.
MWest and Company has been working on dances together since 2011. We were recently awarded the Excellence in the Arts grant and commissioned to present a new dance at the LUMEN festival. Our project at LUMEN was a big hit and we continue to make and refine our works for DanceWorks.
Melissa West is New Dorp's premiere choreographer. She has curated dance programming as part of Second Saturdays Staten Island; has produced shows at the New Dorp Moravian Church, Hunter College, the Bowery Poetry Club, and various other locations throughout Staten Island, NYC, and the east coast. She loves dance and Staten Island so let's help combine these loves into one amazing presentation!


Help us put on an incredible show!
Even though we have received a generous grant from the Council on the Arts and Humanities on Staten Island (funded through the Department of Cultural Affairs), we still need some help to cover production expenses for DanceWorks.
We are trying to raise $1000 to help pay our dancers, fund our venue space, aid in rehearsal space rentals, and cover the many production costs for this show. Even if we don't reach our goal, your generous support will help make this show happen. We cannot do it without the backing of our community. Let's help the Staten Island's dance scene grow!
When you help support DanceWorks, you will get some really cool local gifts, tokens of appreciation, from Staten Island artists. 
 


The Impact
Staten Island has recently seen a surge of activity from local artists, both young and old. With events such as Second Saturdays and the various art events scattered around our borough, we have a hotbed of activity. The Staten Island Dance Jam is a result of this activity and features dancers ranging from 14 years old to 75; these are the faces of Staten Island's diverse population.

<p><span>I assume that everyone who is reading this knows my ""story"" by virtue of the fact that I'm sending this or posting this campaign in places where people know me.</span></p>
<p><span>But, for the people who don't know me, here's the quick and dirty: I was born a poor black child....Dang, that's how Steve Martin started the movie ""The Jerk"" so I better be more original.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm a late-in-life playwright by route of being the ""Diversity Diva"" who has been writing, speaking and working in the diversity and inclusion field for nine years. Before that I was an attorney and a journalist, yada, yada, yada.</span></p>
<p><span>All my paths in life have lead me to being a woman who loves writing plays. I love stories. I love soap operas. I love mysteries. I love eavesdropping on people in coffee shops and in airports. I like contained drama, involving people I make up in my head, and that's what fuels me to write. </span></p>
<p><span>Maybe instead of fueled, I should have said fed, but I do what I do </span><span>because </span><span>I love it and having my play ""Wiccans in the 'Hood"" chosen to be in the Third Annual Midwinter Madness Short Play Festival in New York City in February 2013 is what brings me to seeking </span><span>to find</span><span> Patrons of the Arts. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>My Story's Story</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I live in the 'hood. Not a neighborhood. Not a sweet little suburban enclave. Not an urban, regentrified ""fixer-up</span><span>per</span><span>"" but I live smack dab in the middle of the urban core of the mean streets of Kansas City, Kansas. I live in the house that my grandparents bought when I was nine years old. I moved back in the house when career </span><span>choices</span><span> (mine) </span><span>and</span><span> unfortunate twists of fate (my grandma's Alzheimer's) converged. But, yep, I live in the hood.</span></p>
<p><span>So, when a friend passing through my neighborhood, called</span><span> to tell me that she saw a crescent-shaped pattern of fire burning on a patch of grass</span><span> a few blocks from my house, my first thought was ""Wiccans in the 'Hood?""</span></p>
<p><span>That crazy thought in my head ended up being this play.</span></p>
<p><span>What if a handful of white folks, mistaken for Wiccans (""good"" witches), chose to do some of their spellwork in an urban neighborhood? What would the neighbors think? </span></p>
<p><span>In my 45-minute play, the characters aren't Wiccans but they're engaging in an African religion ritual that still looks mighty strange taking place in the 'hood. </span></p>
<p><span>With a blend of comedy and drama, my play takes on what happens when religions clash. When races clash. When assumptions get examined about life in the middle of a cemetery at night.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Putting a NYC play on its feet from Kansas City, Kansas is no small venture. In </span><span>addition</span><span> to hiring New York City playwright Kevin R.

<div><span> </span></div></div>","My Story
I assume that everyone who is reading this knows my ""story"" by virtue of the fact that I'm sending this or posting this campaign in places where people know me.
But, for the people who don't know me, here's the quick and dirty: I was born a poor black child....Dang, that's how Steve Martin started the movie ""The Jerk"" so I better be more original.
I'm a late-in-life playwright by route of being the ""Diversity Diva"" who has been writing, speaking and working in the diversity and inclusion field for nine years. Before that I was an attorney and a journalist, yada, yada, yada.
All my paths in life have lead me to being a woman who loves writing plays. I love stories. I love soap operas. I love mysteries. I love eavesdropping on people in coffee shops and in airports. I like contained drama, involving people I make up in my head, and that's what fuels me to write. 
Maybe instead of fueled, I should have said fed, but I do what I do because I love it and having my play ""Wiccans in the 'Hood"" chosen to be in the Third Annual Midwinter Madness Short Play Festival in New York City in February 2013 is what brings me to seeking to find Patrons of the Arts. 
My Story's Story
I live in the 'hood. Not a neighborhood. Not a sweet little suburban enclave. Not an urban, regentrified ""fixer-upper"" but I live smack dab in the middle of the urban core of the mean streets of Kansas City, Kansas. I live in the house that my grandparents bought when I was nine years old. I moved back in the house when career choices (mine) and unfortunate twists of fate (my grandma's Alzheimer's) converged. But, yep, I live in the hood.
So, when a friend passing through my neighborhood, called to tell me that she saw a crescent-shaped pattern of fire burning on a patch of grass a few blocks from my house, my first thought was ""Wiccans in the 'Hood?""
That crazy thought in my head ended up being this play.
What if a handful of white folks, mistaken for Wiccans (""good"" witches), chose to do some of their spellwork in an urban neighborhood? What would the neighbors think? 
In my 45-minute play, the characters aren't Wiccans but they're engaging in an African religion ritual that still looks mighty strange taking place in the 'hood. 
With a blend of comedy and drama, my play takes on what happens when religions clash. When races clash. When assumptions get examined about life in the middle of a cemetery at night.
What I Need & What You Get
Putting a NYC play on its feet from Kansas City, Kansas is no small venture. In addition to hiring New York City playwright Kevin R. Free, it requires a person to do sound cues, five actors and a program. Not to mention rehearsal space and me getting to NYC for final rehearsals and the performances.
The festival generously provides the festival staff and the venue of the Roy Arias Studios in Times Square, however, they take the box office so your contributions all go to production costs.
In terms of the breakdown of expenses: Approximately $750 will go to the director, $250 will go to expenses of the actors, $200 to a sound person/stage manager, $300 to rehearsal space, $300 to programs and other minor expenses (such as the cost of this campaign) and approximately $600 for half of my travel and boarding expenses for a weeK in NYC so that I may attend some of the rehearsals and all three of the performances. 
While most of you who give will do it just because you believe in me and support what I do, I'm still dangling a few perks. 
The Impact
A donation will not cure a disease, fund a philanthropic cause or even finance a potential blockbuster movie that might lead to fame and fortune and a chance for you to meet George Clooney or Halle Berry on my yacht in Italy. If you send me a little money, or a lot, you’ll be helping me put on a small play in a small festival in the theatre capital of the world.
On a purely selfish level, you'll be helping me with the exciting experience of having a play I've written on a stage in New York City.
For those of you curious types who want to see what you are contributing to, most of you will get your chance during the Kansas City Fringe Festival that takes places with local actors on July 18-28, 2013 and will be directed by Donette Coleman.

<p>I have recently been accepted into the highly selective Stanislavsky Summer Program, which is an extension of the world-renowned Moscow Art Theatre - the theatre of Stanislavski and Anton Chekhov. The program is a rare chance for American actors to learn Stanislavski's system by working on the plays of Anton Chekhov. I will be going to Cambridge, MA this coming July to sharpen my craft as an actor and an artist.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why are you fundraising? Just get a job, hippie.</em></strong></p>
<p>While the Moscow Art Theater USA does offer a  generous grant, it cannot covers the bulk of this endeavor, and even though the program is under the umbrella of the Moscow Art Theatre School and associated with the American Repertory Theatre at Harvard University, it does not qualify for any educational scholarships or student loans.</p>
<p><strong><em>Let’s talk digits.</em></strong></p>
<p>Tuition: $3,250</p>
<p>Room and Board: $975</p>
<p>Books/Materials: $70</p>
<p>Airfare: $300-400 (approx.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Y’know, I don’t even really like you all that much. Why should I do this for you?</em></strong></p>
<p>This is a first-class training program taught by some of the greatest directors and artists alive today: the students of the students of Stanislavski. <strong>The actors who attend do so out of pocket because the training is worth it. </strong> Being one of them this summer is a personal dream and a labor of love. Your generosity means I can take this once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn Chekhov from today's Russian masters. Every dollar helps!</p>

<strong>Update</strong>:</h2>
<p>At the close of our funding campaign, we are proud to announce the launch of Paidia's <a href=""https://www.paidiaevents.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">web site</a>.  Check it out! You can contact us through the website to book a consultation to discuss your event, and for a limited time we are offering FREE consultations to non profit organizations.  Keep checking this page, too, as we develop and switch to InDemand funding. We'll be listing new perks and selling tickets to our Launch event all from this page! You can still donate, too!     <strong>                                                                      </strong></p>
<h3>The Paidia Story:</h3>
<p>   I've been creating imaginary worlds and adventures since I was a little girl playing in the woods behind my home in the Catskill Mountains.  These creations were the beginning of a<strong> </strong>twenty-year professional career<strong> </strong>telling stories through <strong>dance, theater, and performance art.</strong>   As the mother of two young children, I began to use my theatrical skills to develop immersive events and camps for them and their friends that joined story, play, and adventure.  Inspired by the way that these events excited both the kids and their parents, I began to design similar theatrical events for adults, putting special emphasis on <strong>creating unique and beautiful aesthetic experiences</strong> within environments that supported creative free play.   These endeavors perfectly paired my passion for imaginative play with my skills in event creation and production management.  In 2017, at the suggestion of several friends (and guests at my events) I decided to turn my passion for creating events into a business, and <strong>Paidia</strong><strong><i> </i></strong>(<i>pie-dee-uh</i>) was born.  We are currently recruiting an amazing team of actors, designers, artists, and dancers to work with Paidia, and plan to officially launch in October, 2017.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500326971/vtt2mxx6jbgk3cvrbps6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why put immersive theater into private events?</h3>
<p>We believe in the power of play. In fact, we feel so strongly about play that we named our company after <strong>Paidia</strong>, the<strong> </strong>Greek <strong>goddess of play.</strong>  Our goal is to create <strong>vivid fantasy worlds</strong> that become playgrounds for the imagination, where <strong>the line dissolves</strong> between audience and performer, and actors and guests enter together on an adventure into the unknown.  Our events are more than entertainment, they are<strong> completely unique three-dimensional experiences</strong> that you and your guests will <strong>never forget.</strong>  </p>

<h3>
<strong>Is this basically Live</strong><strong> Action Role Play?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Yes... and no. Many LARPs' focus is primarily on “the adventure”.  At Paidia, we understand that the aesthetic aspects of an event are just as important as the adventure. We are intensely passionate about creating<strong> beautiful events,</strong> and we will work with you to design a stunning event where  your theme, entertainment, and chosen adventure blend seamlessly.   We also meticulously craft our event adventures, which are <strong>full of surprises.</strong> Perhaps you will receive an anonymous love letter, or a mysterious traveling salesman will appear in your midst. You might be presented with a mysterious package, or an urgent coded message. Expect the unexpected. </p>
<h3><strong>How does it work?</strong></h3>
<p>When fully launched, Paidia will offer three tiers of event support:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>An online store </strong>with original theatrical materials designed to support your event, including custom designed letters and tickets, original hand-made props (designed and crafted by our in-house props designer Zzoe Rowan), immersive theater ""party packs"" and creative costume and cos-play accessories.  We plan on launching the store in early 2018.</li>
<li>
<strong>Full-service themed event planning (without actors)</strong>. Let us handle the planning! We will work with florists, caterers, lighting designers, and venues to create an unforgettable event adventure that is accented with our hand-made props and custom designed graphics.  Choose one of our available themes or have one custom designed. Includes on site support before, during, and after event.</li>

<h3>""Now is the winter...""</h3>
<p>Long Island's North Fork is a community filled with history, including many beautiful performance spaces. When contemplating a production of <i>Richard III</i>, the newly formed East End Mobile Theatre decided that the audience and performers would benefit from a production that would change venues after one or two performances. Just as Shakespeare's own company did in the late 16th century, we will travel <i>Richard III</i> around the community, creating numerous opportunities to experience this eerily contemporary play. </p>
<p>Our production team, some of whom will also perform on stage, is filled with young theatre artists who have met through past productions and college training across Long Island and NYC.</p>
<p>The production is led  by actor and director <a href=""http://www.colinpalmer.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Colin Palmer</a>, who has been studying and working on Shakespeare's history plays for all of his young theatrical career. By contributing to this campaign, you will to help make a production 10 years in the making a reality.</p>

<h3>""Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?""</h3>
<p>With any theatre production, a substantial budget is needed. Our $4,000 budget will be spent this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>40% for performance space rentals: our potential performance locations are all community owned non-profits and depend on rental fees to survive. Our performances are just as much for them as they are for our audience.</li>
<li>25% for printing and marketing: ensuring that as many people as possible are able to attend our performances, we will have to advertise online and in print media. We will also have to create programs and other posters</li>
<li>15% for sets, costumes, and props: our set pieces (which will have to be able to move from venue to venue) will have to be built from scratch. Small props and costume pieces will also have to be purchased for most actors.</li>
<li>5% for actor stipends: some of our actors will be commuting from New York City and western Long Island. This will help to defray their travel costs.</li>
<li>5% for miscellaneous expense: this includes perks for our sponsors, refreshments for the audience, and other assorted odds and ends</li>
<li>10% for Indiegogo fees</li>
</ul>
<p>When you contribute to our campaign, you'll receive perks that keep you connected to our performances, whether during the rehearsal process, in person at a show, or after we close.</p>

<h3>""Was ever woman in this humor wooed?""</h3>
<p>The North Fork has a wonderful tradition of providing quality theatre to residents and visitors, especially in the summertime. Our production builds on that tradition, since we are setting out to reach as large an audience as possible. Not only will more people be able to see the play, but our audiences will get to develop an new appreciation for the wonderful meeting houses and performance halls in their own backyards.</p>
<p>This may seem like a lofty goal, but rest assured: this is not our first rodeo. Members of  the cast and crew have been involved in self producing their own work on the East End for years, mostly with the youth theatre group Management Productions. They have presented thought provoking and popular productions of <i>Assassins, The Who's Tommy,  </i>and <i>All in the Timing </i>all over Riverhead and Southold.</p>

<h3>""A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!""</h3>
<p>Of course, a very real possibility remains: that this crowdsourcing campaign will not reach its goal. No matter what, our production will go on. If we do not reach our goal of $4,000, then we will have to decrease our number of performances and venues, and possibly alter our production design. But, if we raise more than our goal, that means more performances and a wider availability to East End theatre goers</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>""Let us to't pell-mell / If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.""</h3>
<p>Please consider sharing our campaign with your friends, coworkers, and family. Word of mouth will not only help us reach our goal, but also reach out to a wider audience when it comes time to finally perform. Thanks for reading and we'll see you in the audience!</p>

The production is led  by actor and director Colin Palmer, who has been studying and working on Shakespeare's history plays for all of his young theatrical career. By contributing to this campaign, you will to help make a production 10 years in the making a reality.

The historical Richard III and family
 

""Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?""
With any theatre production, a substantial budget is needed. Our $4,000 budget will be spent this way:

40% for performance space rentals: our potential performance locations are all community owned non-profits and depend on rental fees to survive. Our performances are just as much for them as they are for our audience.
25% for printing and marketing: ensuring that as many people as possible are able to attend our performances, we will have to advertise online and in print media. We will also have to create programs and other posters
15% for sets, costumes, and props: our set pieces (which will have to be able to move from venue to venue) will have to be built from scratch. Small props and costume pieces will also have to be purchased for most actors.
5% for actor stipends: some of our actors will be commuting from New York City and western Long Island. This will help to defray their travel costs.
5% for miscellaneous expense: this includes perks for our sponsors, refreshments for the audience, and other assorted odds and ends
10% for Indiegogo fees

When you contribute to our campaign, you'll receive perks that keep you connected to our performances, whether during the rehearsal process, in person at a show, or after we close.

Set Model Detail for Act IV
 

""Was ever woman in this humor wooed?""
The North Fork has a wonderful tradition of providing quality theatre to residents and visitors, especially in the summertime. Our production builds on that tradition, since we are setting out to reach as large an audience as possible. Not only will more people be able to see the play, but our audiences will get to develop an new appreciation for the wonderful meeting houses and performance halls in their own backyards.
This may seem like a lofty goal, but rest assured: this is not our first rodeo. Members of  the cast and crew have been involved in self producing their own work on the East End for years, mostly with the youth theatre group Management Productions. They have presented thought provoking and popular productions of Assassins, The Who's Tommy,  and All in the Timing all over Riverhead and Southold.

Costume Sketches
 

""A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!""
Of course, a very real possibility remains: that this crowdsourcing campaign will not reach its goal. No matter what, our production will go on. If we do not reach our goal of $4,000, then we will have to decrease our number of performances and venues, and possibly alter our production design. But, if we raise more than our goal, that means more performances and a wider availability to East End theatre goers
 

""Let us to't pell-mell / If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.""
Please consider sharing our campaign with your friends, coworkers, and family. Word of mouth will not only help us reach our goal, but also reach out to a wider audience when it comes time to finally perform. Thanks for reading and we'll see you in the audience!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>THE PRODUCTION </h3>
<p>MILLICENT SCOWLWORTHY is an ensemble production put up by a cast and creative team of 15+ emerging theater artists in NYC. We'll be performing the show September 20th-September 30th at UNCANNY VALLEY, a new performance space in Brooklyn. Our group is made up of a director, twelve actors, a dramaturg, and designers from all around the country. We frequently work professionally in theater and in television, but all believe in the value of generating and leading our own work.</p>
<p>And that's why MILLICENT SCOWLWORTHY is so important to us-- it's a deeply theatrical play asking important questions, and the production is being generated entirely by young artists. It's a play about how young people react to violence, and every single person involved in this production is under 30.</p>
<h3>
<br/>AND THOSE PEOPLE INCLUDE...</h3>
<p>Sam French (director), Stephanie Kane (dramaturg), Lucy Pope (set), Lizzie Donnelan (costumes), and actors Sarah Chalfie, Alexis Floyd, Harron Atkins, Kyle Wilson, Maya Maniar, Jacob Stewart, Ellen Haun, Luke LaMontagne, Rosie Yadid, Jackson Perrin,  Nicole Vazquez, and Iris Beaumier.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE BUDGET (and the belief behind it)</h3>
<p>In budgeting our production of MILLICENT SCOWLWORTHY, it was important for us to respect every dollar given to us. In our eyes, that means keeping the budget as small as possible. It also means not wasting money on superficial elements that will end up in the dumpster after we close. Instead, we're putting as much of the money as we can into the space, the people in it, and the ideas being discussed.<br/> <br/>Of the $5000 we are raising...</p>
<ul>
<li>50% goes to paying (a little) to the artists involved.</li>
<li>32% goes to securing the right performance space and the right rehearsal spaces.</li>
<li>13% goes to the actual physical production of the show-- costumes, sets, etc.</li>
<li>And the rest goes in a bunch of crazy directions-- insurance, scripts, etc.</li>

</h3> <p>Hi, we're Jorge and Adam. Two members of the <a href=""http://www.unnaturalshow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unnatural Selection</a> podcast and we're deciding to get back to our roots and make some theatre.

<p>Up until this point our producing work has been pretty independant. I mean really independant - like with a capital 'I'. More like guerilla theatre, we're talking about here.

 sector in Canada and promotes a healthy, sustainable environment in 
which professional dance practice can grow and thrive.  CDA cultivates a
 strong national voice for Canadian professional dance and supports the 
development of resources for this field of artistic expression. Through 
conferences, workshops, and networking events we connect the dance 
community from coast to coast, building a cohesive and dynamic milieu.The Brass TacksWhat is International Dance Day (IDD)? Why are we having an event?International Dance Day was introduced in 1982 by the International Dance Committee of the International Theatre Institute (ITI), a UNESCO
 partner NGO, and is celebrated on April 29 every year. The date was 
suggested by the International Dance Committee of ITI to commemorate the
 birthday of Jean-Georges Noverre (1727-1810), creator of modern ballet and author of the famous Lettres sur la danse published in 1760 in Lyon[1]

The goal of the “International Dance Day Message” is to celebrate 
Dance, to revel in the universality of this art form, to cross all 
political, cultural and ethnic barriers and bring people together 
through the common language of Dance. Every year, the
International Dance Committee of the UNESCO International Theatre Institute
circulates a message around the world as part of International Dance Day
celebrations. Additionally, since 2005, the Canadian Dance Assembly (CDA) has
issued a Canadian message in conjunction with the UNESCO message. Santee Smith,
choreographer, dancer, and Artistic Director of Kaha:wi Dance Theatre offers
her call to action, on behalf of the Canadian Dance Assembly in celebration of
International Dance Day 2014.  This year Canadian Dance Assembly is coordinating a free noon-hour event for the public at Yonge and Dundas Square in
celebration of IDD.  Our enthusiastic MC, Kevin Ormsby
of KasheDance, will guide us through a dance journey to be sure we ‘catch the
rhythm’ on this special occasion.  The Canadian Dance Assembly will also invite
local politicians to attend and dance with us.  Catch the Rhythm is completely free and is open to general public ages 1 to
100.Each dollar you donate go towards making Catch the Rhythm a
 fun and dynamic event for everyone to enjoy. All proceeds go towards 
logistics and operating costs. Where the money goes and what you get for your contribution:
Technical requirements, the lights, the speakers, the stage, the people behind the scenes making the day come together.
From swag, honourable mentions, or you can even buy a tent to help promote your own project, business or organization!
No
 matter the amount raised it will go towards the event and towards 
thanking those who help us with on the ground support during the day.

<h3>Who We Are &amp; <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Story So Far</span>
</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.anandadrama.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AnandaDrama</a> is the theatre collective of Ananda College, comprising students and young alumni. It grew from an initiative that began in 2006 to improve the English skills of students through theatre. In 2013, we set up AnandaDrama as a proper theatre company and staged two very successful public shows.</p>
<p>The first of these, <b>Alles in Wonderland</b>, was an original political satire that began as a <a href=""http://www.sundaytimes.lk/130512/magazine/new-take-on-an-old-tale-43941.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">championship winning entry</a> to an inter school drama competition. Due to popular demand, it was later staged as a sell out public show seen by <a href=""http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=Secretary_Defence_Graces_Ananda_College_Variety_Show_20130615_02"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">top officials</a> and even identified in<a href=""http://groundviews.org/2013/07/19/alles-in-wonderland-and-indo-lanka-relations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> local discourse about Indo-Sri Lanka relations</a>. Next came <b>Kensuke's Kingdom</b>, a lyrical full length play <a href=""http://www.ft.lk/2013/08/03/morpugos-kensukes-kingdom-at-punchi-theatre/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">that explored different aspects of theatre</a> and <a href=""http://www.sundaytimes.lk/130728/magazine/not-mere-childs-play-micheal-morpurgos-kensukes-kingdom-54375.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gave our young cast fresh challenges</a>. </p>
<p>When we started work on our production for 2014, we wanted to set the bar even higher by involving everyone in the cast in the creative process. Instead of performing to a pre-written script, we decided to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devised_theatre"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">devise</a> an original full length play.</p>
<p>In January, we invited internationally acclaimed playwright, screenwriter and director <a href=""https://efworld.org/our-programs/international/ruwanthie-de-chickera"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ruwanthie de Chickera</a> and the <a href=""http://stages.lk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stages Theatre Group</a> to help us devise. Workshops started in February. In the first few weeks, we worked on our acting skills and also talked through the stories and issues that really moved us as a group.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We realised early on that we all wanted our play to be more than just entertainment. We wanted to tell a story that would provide important insights about our society. The idea of using the Grease Yaka as the vehicle for our play sprang up during one workshop, and immediately caught everyone's interest. Over the next few months of devising, the play took shape.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why <i>Grease Yaka</i>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Sri Lankan society tends to get worked up about all sorts of things--quite often, for little or no reason. The Grease Yaka phenomenon that gripped the
country not so long ago is the metaphor that we have used to hold up a mirror
to society.</p>
<p><i>Yaka</i> is the Sinhala word for demon, and describes many mythical beings that have populated Sri Lankan folklore for centuries. The <b>Grease Yaka</b> is much more recent: it is an urban legend about a grease covered, near naked man who delights in peeping at unsuspecting women. Some believe that the Grease Yaka is more than a really creepy voyeur: robbery, rape and murder have also been laid at his door.</p>
<p>There was a sudden uptick in <a href=""http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/08/19/sri-lanka-the-return-of-the-grease-devils/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">reported Grease Yaka sightings all over Sri Lanka</a><a href=""http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/08/19/sri-lanka-the-return-of-the-grease-devils/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> a few years ago. This led to a social phobia that almost veered towards mass hysteria. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our play is a fantasia that charts this process. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Though it employs a very light touch, the play </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">poses searching questions about what sort of society we want ours to be. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">At a time when there are distant (and not so distant) rumblings of new confusions, phobias and hysteria in our midst, </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Grease Yaka</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> is topical and very relevant. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And, needless to say, as a piece of original devised theatre, it is also hugely entertaining.</span></p>
<br/>
</div>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why We Need Your Help</span><br/>
</h3>
<div>
<p>The devising is done. The script is ready. The theatre is paid for. The set design is done. The posters are up. The actors are pumped. Come what may, we will put on a show to remember... and to provoke thought. But we need your help!</p>
<p><b>Immediate Requirements</b><br/></p>
<p>We need you to help us pay for the Set, Costumes, Props and Makeup. These are turning out to be a lot more expensive than we initially thought, but if we can afford them, they will contribute hugely to the magic we hope to create on stage. </p>
<p>We also want to share <i>Grease Yaka</i> with more people than just the lucky 1,240 who will get to see it in the theatre this August. If we reach our funding target, we will make sure that a performance of the play is made into a professional DVD. </p>
<p><b>After the Production</b></p>
<p><i>Grease Yaka</i> is part of the Stages Theatre Group's <b>Education Outreach</b> effort. This involves educating students from selected schools about the process of creating and shaping the play. Workshops will be held before and after the production, and a comprehensive Resource Pack will be shared with students and teachers to encourage further learning. Your contributions will help make this happen.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, we believe that the play and its message are important enough that <i>Grease Yaka</i> needs to be seen much more widely. We have plans to take it on <b>tour around Sri Lanka </b>and<b> </b>maybe even <b>perform it abroad</b>. While we are not looking for funding for this just yet, your contributions at this stage will help us create the magic in the initial production that will make touring almost inevitable. </p>
<p></p>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b><h3>The Funding Situation At The Moment</h3></b></div>

The first of these, Alles in Wonderland, was an original political satire that began as a championship winning entry to an inter school drama competition. Due to popular demand, it was later staged as a sell out public show seen by top officials and even identified in local discourse about Indo-Sri Lanka relations. Next came Kensuke's Kingdom, a lyrical full length play that explored different aspects of theatre and gave our young cast fresh challenges. 
When we started work on our production for 2014, we wanted to set the bar even higher by involving everyone in the cast in the creative process. Instead of performing to a pre-written script, we decided to devise an original full length play.
In January, we invited internationally acclaimed playwright, screenwriter and director Ruwanthie de Chickera and the Stages Theatre Group to help us devise. Workshops started in February. In the first few weeks, we worked on our acting skills and also talked through the stories and issues that really moved us as a group.

We realised early on that we all wanted our play to be more than just entertainment. We wanted to tell a story that would provide important insights about our society. The idea of using the Grease Yaka as the vehicle for our play sprang up during one workshop, and immediately caught everyone's interest. Over the next few months of devising, the play took shape.


Why Grease Yaka


Sri Lankan society tends to get worked up about all sorts of things--quite often, for little or no reason. The Grease Yaka phenomenon that gripped the
country not so long ago is the metaphor that we have used to hold up a mirror
to society.
Yaka is the Sinhala word for demon, and describes many mythical beings that have populated Sri Lankan folklore for centuries. The Grease Yaka is much more recent: it is an urban legend about a grease covered, near naked man who delights in peeping at unsuspecting women. Some believe that the Grease Yaka is more than a really creepy voyeur: robbery, rape and murder have also been laid at his door.
There was a sudden uptick in reported Grease Yaka sightings all over Sri Lanka a few years ago. This led to a social phobia that almost veered towards mass hysteria. Our play is a fantasia that charts this process. Though it employs a very light touch, the play poses searching questions about what sort of society we want ours to be. 
At a time when there are distant (and not so distant) rumblings of new confusions, phobias and hysteria in our midst, Grease Yaka is topical and very relevant. And, needless to say, as a piece of original devised theatre, it is also hugely entertaining.



Why We Need Your Help


The devising is done. The script is ready. The theatre is paid for. The set design is done. The posters are up. The actors are pumped. Come what may, we will put on a show to remember... and to provoke thought. But we need your help!
Immediate Requirements
We need you to help us pay for the Set, Costumes, Props and Makeup. These are turning out to be a lot more expensive than we initially thought, but if we can afford them, they will contribute hugely to the magic we hope to create on stage. 
We also want to share Grease Yaka with more people than just the lucky 1,240 who will get to see it in the theatre this August. If we reach our funding target, we will make sure that a performance of the play is made into a professional DVD. 
After the Production
Grease Yaka is part of the Stages Theatre Group's Education Outreach effort. This involves educating students from selected schools about the process of creating and shaping the play. Workshops will be held before and after the production, and a comprehensive Resource Pack will be shared with students and teachers to encourage further learning. Your contributions will help make this happen.
Even more importantly, we believe that the play and its message are important enough that Grease Yaka needs to be seen much more widely. We have plans to take it on tour around Sri Lanka and maybe even perform it abroad. While we are not looking for funding for this just yet, your contributions at this stage will help us create the magic in the initial production that will make touring almost inevitable. 


The Funding Situation At The Moment
This is the estimate of what we will need to stage Grease Yaka in style:




This is where we stand now (just two weeks to go to the performance!)





We need approximately $9,000 more to ensure that the play is fully funded!

How Things Could Play Out



We meet our target: We put on a show that will forever be remembered by its audience, and is available on DVD for posterity, and is turned into a creative learning experience for a large number of students in Sri Lanka.

We exceed our target: Every single cent above and beyond what we spend on the play (as well as all proceeds from the play) will be used to fund English and Theatre development activities at Ananda College.

We don't meet our target:  Indiegogo will send us whatever funds we do raise, so hopefully we will have something significant to work with even if we don't reach our target. No matter what, the show will go on!


Please Help Us!



 Please donate whatever you can. Any and all financial contributions are most welcome, and we have special perks lined up for contributions of a certain value.

<h3>Summary of the Project:</h3>
<p>My name is Bobby Halvorson and I am a student at California Institute of the Arts. I am earning a Doctorate of Musical Arts in music performance and composition. As my final performance presentation project I, with the help of my collaborator Daniel Alexander Jones, am producing an original musical based on ""The Marvelous Land of OZ"" by L. Frank Baum. I hesitate to use the word ""musical,"" however.</p>
<p>What we intend to create is not a piece that resembles the classic musicals of Rogers and Hammerstein or Andrew Lloyd Weber that many people are familiar with. We wish to create a physical environment (the Land of OZ) that the audience may step in and out of. The colors, characters, sounds, and biospheres will all define this universe and upon entering the space in which the performance will be held, audience members will be transported. In other words, there will be no fourth wall or separation between the audience and the elements of OZ. Audience members will be encouraged to sit or stand or walk about the space as they wish.</p>
<p>There will be a linear narrative written by Jones that is based on the storyline of the book. Musical numbers will be performed throughout, linking the journey together. There will be a chamber music ensemble of approximately 9 members, a mixed choir of approximately 15 singers and a cast of around 8-10. Most of the personnel will be either currently enrolled CalArts students or CalArts affiliated. </p>
<p>This presentation is incredibly important as it will be the jumping off point of future productions. After this presentation, which we plan to document in its entirety, we plan to present this piece to multiple theaters both nationally and internationally and therefore we'd like your help in making it as wonderful as possible.</p>
<p>The show you will be contributing to will be presented globally and your help in creating the best product we can achieve is paramount.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We are hoping to achieve a goal of $3,000 by March 1st, 2013. What we need is your personal contribution to help us fund this work. Your donation will be going to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>costume and set design and the materials needed for each</li>
<li>lighting design/equipment rental</li>
<li>sound system rental and set up</li>
<li>honorarium for outside contributors (lighting board technician, sound engineer, costume and set designers, projectionist, etc.)</li>
<li>advertising and promotion</li>
<li>piano tuning</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will completely alter the way musical theater is viewed. Since the days of Rogers and Hammerstein, musical theater has become a tired genre as opposed to an innovative form of art. Opera and musical theater have been divided into two seperate forms of music for theatrical purposes. What is the reason for this? Traditionally, opera is entirely sung whereas musical theater makes use of spoken dialogue. Aside from these characteristics, the music in musical theater has tended to lean more toward popular idioms and the singing styles employed are not ""classical"" in style. Why can't musical theater make use of non-traditional harmonies and song structure? Why can't musical theater explore the farthest reaches of the human voice and all its capabilities to create deeper character dynamic? We plan to further the genre of musical theater so it doesn't get stuck in the mud. New ideas are preeminant and to make these ideas realities, we need your help.</p>

<h3>The Birth of Birthday Sax</h3>
The time was the 80's.  The place was New Jersey.  A solo saxophone played in the distance.* A child was born to a German father and an American mother.  That child was Tim Girrbach.  And little did anyone know that this combination would inspire Tim to create his character Manheim (based on his German father) and the show ""Birthday Sax,"" known in some circles as ""I Wanna Sax You Up!""</div>
<div> </div>
<div>*slight fabrication for impact</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
We are presenting a 1-night only fully-realized production of ""Birthday Sax"" at Ars Nova, as part of their fantastic ANT FEST.  There will be Manheim.  There will be his Frauleins.  There will be The Garden State Sax Quartet. And of course there will be all of your favorite 1980's movie soundtrack songs!<br/><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
As most of you probably know - puttin' on a show ain't cheap!  Even though it is a 1-night event, we still need everything we would for a longer run.  We will use these fabulous contributions for costumes, props, music, rehearsal space, and more!  We will also be paying our cast and creative team a little something for their hard work. </div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Every contribution will help and we are not asking a lot.  If you can't give $25, give $10.  If you can't give $10, send this link to a friend who might be able to.  Seriously every little bit will add up and help us greatly.  And whatever you do, don't forget to buy your ticket at Ars Nova for June 8th!</div></div>","The Birth of Birthday Sax

<h3>Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Gospel Choir</h3>
<p>The Church of Stop Shopping, along with Reverend Billy, is a New York City based radical performance community, with 45 performing members and a congregation in the thousands. We are anti-consumerist gospel shouting, earth loving activists and have worked with communities on 4 continents defending land, life, and imagination from reckless development and environmentally destructive practices.  Learn more about our work at <a href=""http://www.revbilly.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.revbilly.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Sermon and Song at the Temple at Burning Man</h3>
<p>Burn-a-lujah!! The Stop Shopping Choir is honored to be asked to perform at the Temple by artists David and Maggie Best and the Temple's community of artists and builders. The Temple is constantly active over the week of Burning Man.  People journey there with their mementos from those loved ones who have died in the last 12 months.  The entire week, any time of day or night, mourners can be found at the Temple gazing into photographs, reading messages, tacking up a bit of cloth or a feather.  Then on Sunday night, the last night of Black Rock City each year, the Temple is burned down to the embers within a ring of tens of thousands of silent mourners. </p>
<p>The Burning Man 2012 theme is Fertility.  This year, the ones who have lost their mothers will have special care.  The ""Temple of Juno"" honors the love and the work of mothers, and honors our sorrowing for our mothers when they pass from us.<br/><br/>The Mother Earth is under attack by corporations and governments like never before.  The power of creativity is profited-from, but unacknowledged by the economy based on Consumerism and Militarism.  The present leaders cannot seem to stop subsidizing fossil fuel habits, and CO2 rises every week. This is the era of the extinction of living things.  We carry around with us the threat to the lives of our children.  We pretend that we will never live to see the motherlessness of the Silent Spring. </p>
<p>We will come to the end of this year's Burning Man on the high desert playa and prepare for the 51 weeks back in cities, traffic, and computers with a pledge to become radical Earth warriors.  The Temple of Juno will be the mother of our courage! </p>
<h3>Partner with Us in our Mission to Black Rock City!</h3>
<p>Please join us in bringing the Stop Shopping gospel to Burning Man this year! We are sending 27 active members of our Church to perform with Reverend Billy at the Temple.  Your support will help us cover our camp infrastructure, performance equipment, food, and desert-survival provisions for all traveling performers. </p>

<h3>A Little More Story</h3>
<p>I have been making performance in Philadelphia since I came here to study at the Headlong Performance Institute in 2012. My work with Chelsea Murphy has been presented locally and in other cities by FringeArts, JACK, Joe’s Pub DanceNOW, the Effervescent Collective and NoTheme Festival. I received an Independence Fellowship in 2018. My work romances many genres: dance, theater, stand-up comedy, and lecture/demonstration.  I work collaboratively and in daunting isolation. Themes that come up again and again for me are: shame, death, grief, wildness, subversion, childhood and sass. </p>
<p>From 2012-2015 I was the Artist-in-Residence at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I taught visual art to children and young adults in the oncology units. This was some of the most meaningful work of my life. This show is in direct response to my experiences at the hospital. It asks the question: what would a child do with paint if no adult ever told them they were doing it wrong? What would a child do if they had all the resources I could give them? This piece is made possible through an Independence Fellowship.</p>

<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/144659/files/20131020194223-Desperation-3.jpg?1382323343"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>DESPERATION</b></p>
<p>Dark Humour Productions is a Chicago-Based Theatre Company that creates and performs new works.  Our current project, ""Desperation,"" is an improvised dramatic one-act play that uses an improvised fight style created by D.H.P.'s Co-Artistic Director and Resident Fight Guy Alex Farrington.  </p>
<p>We are very excited about ""Desperation"" because it is a project that we haven't heard of before.  The actors will create everything in front of the audience: The characters, the relationships, their stories, and even the fight choreography.  </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Since improvisation allows the actors to create everything they need, costs are pretty minimal.  We're renting a space to rehearse and a space to perform.  </p>
<p><b>Here's what we're looking at</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Roughly $300 for rehearsal space</li>
<li>About $700 for theatre rentals and insurance</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What's in it for you?</b></p>
<p>We've got some pretty cool gifts on the right hand side.  Check them out!</p>
<p><b>Where does the money go?</b></p>
<p>If we don't make our goal Dark Humour will cover the rest of the cost.  If we do make the goal the next $200 goes to Dark Humour, and everything over that gets split evenly between the actors, the director, and the fight guy.</p>
<p><b>What We're Trying To Do</b></p>
<p>We really like this project because we're bringing something new to the table.  There is a lot of improv in Chicago, and the bulk of it is comedic.  There are far fewer companies creating dramatic improv, but we don't know of anybody doing it with improvised stage combat.  </p>
<p>Dark Humour has always valued original works, but to us that meant either writing our shows or putting on projects of new playwrights.  Now we're trying to create something we haven't seen before, and to be honest, we think that's really cool.  We're betting that other people will think it is too.  </p>
<p><b>But I'm Broke!</b></p>

<p></p></span></span></span></div>","DESPERATION
Dark Humour Productions is a Chicago-Based Theatre Company that creates and performs new works.  Our current project, ""Desperation,"" is an improvised dramatic one-act play that uses an improvised fight style created by D.H.P.'s Co-Artistic Director and Resident Fight Guy Alex Farrington.  
We are very excited about ""Desperation"" because it is a project that we haven't heard of before.  The actors will create everything in front of the audience: The characters, the relationships, their stories, and even the fight choreography.  
What We Need & What You Get
Since improvisation allows the actors to create everything they need, costs are pretty minimal.  We're renting a space to rehearse and a space to perform.  
Here's what we're looking at

Roughly $300 for rehearsal space
About $700 for theatre rentals and insurance

What's in it for you?
We've got some pretty cool gifts on the right hand side.  Check them out!
Where does the money go?
If we don't make our goal Dark Humour will cover the rest of the cost.  If we do make the goal the next $200 goes to Dark Humour, and everything over that gets split evenly between the actors, the director, and the fight guy.
What We're Trying To Do
We really like this project because we're bringing something new to the table.  There is a lot of improv in Chicago, and the bulk of it is comedic.  There are far fewer companies creating dramatic improv, but we don't know of anybody doing it with improvised stage combat.  
Dark Humour has always valued original works, but to us that meant either writing our shows or putting on projects of new playwrights.  Now we're trying to create something we haven't seen before, and to be honest, we think that's really cool.  We're betting that other people will think it is too.  
But I'm Broke!
Trust us.  We're actors.  We've all been there.  If you can't afford to give anything right now we wish you the best.  If you still like our idea and wanna help out, just give us a tweet or a facebook plug.  We really appreciate it.

</div></div>","About Me?

My name is Eshe Shukura. I am currently a third year student at Hampshire College studying theater with an emphasis on acting and social justice. Theater has been a part of my life since the age of 11and I've always had a deep emotional connection to the art form. I believe theater can change the world. Theatre explores human nature and behavior. It bridges communities, tells untold stories, and weaves together a loose sense of humanity. I want to work in theater as a career and I dream of one day opening my own theater company that produces new works that challenge the current social order. My theatre company will exist to fully support social justice projects and scholarship.  Why NTI?


The National Theater Institute (NTI) is a semester-long conservatory style theater program put on by the Eugene O'Neill Theater, a non-profit theater company in Waterford, CT. At NTI, I will have the chance to work with theatre professionals in multiple disciplines of theatre who will provide me the resources and knowledge I need to realize my dreams. At NTI, the learning will stretch beyond the classroom and even the state of Connecticut. A semester at NTI provides students with the unique opportunity of a two-week theater study at St. Petersburg State Theatre Arts Academy in St. Petersburg, Russia. Participating in NTI is a chance that will broaden my cultural outlook and my artistic bank.Why Fund This?

<h3>About Indah and the Project</h3>
<p>Indah M. Walsh is a choreographer, dancer, and teacher.  She is in the MFA dance program at NYU Tisch.  As a second year MFA student at NYU Tisch, she has been awarded a Graduate Assistantship in Video for the Department of Dance.  Prior to pursuing graduate studies, Indah completed a BFA in dance from SUNY Purchase College Conservatory of Dance and continues to choreograph and present work in New York, California, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>This campaign will make it possible for Indah to create a work in collaboration with a percussionist.  This October, Indah will present a new group work as part of the Second Avenue Dance Company Concert.  For this piece she will collaborate with fellow NYU students; two lighting designers and five dancers.  With enough of your contributions, she will have the means to work with a live percussionist!</p>
<p>Being in New York City surrounded by talented and passionate artists it's a shame there aren't more collaborations!  If you are a supporter of dance and music collaborations please consider making a contribution to this campaign.  </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>This project will involve 10 rehearsals with the musician and 2 performances for an estimated cost of $700.  Any amount of contributions will help make the collaboration happen.</p>
<h3>Why Contribute to Dance and Music Collaborations?</h3>
<p>Working with live musicians and having music made specifically for a dance piece offers possibilities for a full, dynamic work of art.  It allows for the work to develop in ways that may be limited by pre-recorded music.  Collaborating with others also creates an environment for artistic and personal growth for all involved including the dancers, musician, and choreographer.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It's understandable that not everyone can contribute financially to this campaign.  Other ways to contribute would be to share this information with some one and/or attend live dance performances.  Our performance will be October 17-19 at 8pm at 111 2nd avenue New York, NY in the 5th Floor Theater.</p>

<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#006600"">Several Christmases ago, two best buddies had the wonderfully unique idea to stage a Christmas ""Spectacular"" in one of their houses. It featured thousands of manually operated dancing Christmas Lights set to original music as well as a bunch of Christmastime standards- it was called ""Lights of Joy"". From this humble beginning came the next installment, the following Christmas. This one featured an original storyline combining elements from <i>The Nutcracker &amp; A Christmas Carol (</i>ie: a scene was shared between Ebenezer Scrooge and the Drosselmeyer). As time went on, the quality of their shows increased until they reached the inevitable, stumbling upon the exhilarating script that was: Every Christmas Story Ever Told in 2008. Thus marking the first production under their new title- Masters' Theatre Group. This performance took place at Grace Lutheran Church and School with minimal production value- our name was fresh and, with that, the word had not yet reached the masses. Our support team, while minimal received the show with great gusto and inspired us to keep going!</font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#006600""><br/></font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#006600"">We're back and better than ever! A holiday homecoming of sorts, several artists are coming from their current locations in New York and all around Florida to put on a show that will take Masters Theatre Group to a new level! We, at MTG, consistently strive to deliver the highest quality in innovative, original theatre and it is only made possible by the generous contributions from people like you. The future of MTG is dependent upon YOU- our supporters! </font><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-family: 'comic sans ms';"">Theatre is very important to all of us and it is a very important piece of our culture- it is a valid means of communication and storytelling, it is an escape from everyday life and the magic of theatre comes alive when friends, family and strangers are able to bond over a single event. </span></p>

Every Christmas Story Ever Told- What is it??
Every Christmas Story Ever Told (and then some) is a 90 minute madcap romp through the holiday season.
Written by Michael Carleton, Jim FitzGerald & John K Alvarez with an Original Song by Will Knapp.

This show has it all: A Christmas Carol, It's A Wonderful Life, The Grinch, The Nutcracker and even the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade! You name it, it's in the show! It will leave you laughing harder than spiked egg-nog, that's our guarantee!! YULE CRACK UP!

From the Living Room to the Studio...
Several Christmases ago, two best buddies had the wonderfully unique idea to stage a Christmas ""Spectacular"" in one of their houses. It featured thousands of manually operated dancing Christmas Lights set to original music as well as a bunch of Christmastime standards- it was called ""Lights of Joy"". From this humble beginning came the next installment, the following Christmas. This one featured an original storyline combining elements from The Nutcracker & A Christmas Carol (ie: a scene was shared between Ebenezer Scrooge and the Drosselmeyer). As time went on, the quality of their shows increased until they reached the inevitable, stumbling upon the exhilarating script that was: Every Christmas Story Ever Told in 2008. Thus marking the first production under their new title- Masters' Theatre Group. This performance took place at Grace Lutheran Church and School with minimal production value- our name was fresh and, with that, the word had not yet reached the masses. Our support team, while minimal received the show with great gusto and inspired us to keep going!

We're back and better than ever! A holiday homecoming of sorts, several artists are coming from their current locations in New York and all around Florida to put on a show that will take Masters Theatre Group to a new level! We, at MTG, consistently strive to deliver the highest quality in innovative, original theatre and it is only made possible by the generous contributions from people like you. The future of MTG is dependent upon YOU- our supporters! Theatre is very important to all of us and it is a very important piece of our culture- it is a valid means of communication and storytelling, it is an escape from everyday life and the magic of theatre comes alive when friends, family and strangers are able to bond over a single event.

<p><strong>Women of Color Productions, Inc.</strong><strong> </strong>is a non-for-profit company that produces, creates and presents new plays, classical plays, musicals, performance art pieces, film festivals and TV projects by or about Women of Color.  Our projects are multicultural and deal with the alternative political and cultural perspectives from the past, present and future.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Women of Color Human Rights Theatre Project</strong> will present workshop productions of five one-act plays that deal with human rights issues from the perspective of characters who are women of color.  The three playwrights in our 2011 Playwright Development Program, Kristine M. Reyes, Jorshinelle Taleon-Sonza and Jacqueline Wade, began researching and writing their plays in April 2011 under the guidance of dramaturg Maxine Kern.</p>
<p>From the Philippines to Rwanda, Nazi Germany to New York City, these plays span time and place in order to shed light on the many injustices suffered by women of color throughout the world’s history.  While each story is unique, there is a common thread that proves the strength and resiliency of these women characters, even in the face of tremendous hardship.</p>
<p>Your contributions and support will help make this project a reality, and allow these untold stories to finally be heard.</p>
<p>We want to thank everyone who helped us raise $550 in the first campaign.  We have used the money to pay for advertisement for auditions for actors, payment for rental spaces for auditions, down payment to union director-choreographer of the plays, ""Lola Luning’s First Steps"" and ""Mama Africa"", payment for Volunteer insurance needed to apply for the Actors’ Equity Showcase status for the  project, and down payment for rehearsal space and other expenses.  We were able to put the money we raised to thus far to great use.  Thank you. </p>
<p>We still need your generous assistance and support with raising more funds for this wonderful human rights project of one-act plays. This is a project of love for everyone involved in it.   However, it still takes money and your support to make it happen.  These are great plays that need to be seen.  Also, if you know one of the playwrights or other artists involved in the project, please help support them.   They have all worked very hard on it.</p>
<p>Some of our expenses.  include:  raising more money to help pay off the rest of the rental for the theatre, payment of the playbill, raising more money for material for costumes, sets, and props, stipends for actors, final payments for directors’ fees, sound designer’ fee, lighting’ designer’s fee, stage manger’s fee, publicist’s fee, along with other expenses, Your generous contributions will be put to great use. It will help us bring a high quality professional production.  Thank you for all of your support.</p>

Women of Color Productions, Inc. is a non-for-profit company that produces, creates and presents new plays, classical plays, musicals, performance art pieces, film festivals and TV projects by or about Women of Color.  Our projects are multicultural and deal with the alternative political and cultural perspectives from the past, present and future. 
The Women of Color Human Rights Theatre Project will present workshop productions of five one-act plays that deal with human rights issues from the perspective of characters who are women of color.  The three playwrights in our 2011 Playwright Development Program, Kristine M. Reyes, Jorshinelle Taleon-Sonza and Jacqueline Wade, began researching and writing their plays in April 2011 under the guidance of dramaturg Maxine Kern.
From the Philippines to Rwanda, Nazi Germany to New York City, these plays span time and place in order to shed light on the many injustices suffered by women of color throughout the world’s history.  While each story is unique, there is a common thread that proves the strength and resiliency of these women characters, even in the face of tremendous hardship.
Your contributions and support will help make this project a reality, and allow these untold stories to finally be heard.
We want to thank everyone who helped us raise $550 in the first campaign.  We have used the money to pay for advertisement for auditions for actors, payment for rental spaces for auditions, down payment to union director-choreographer of the plays, ""Lola Luning’s First Steps"" and ""Mama Africa"", payment for Volunteer insurance needed to apply for the Actors’ Equity Showcase status for the  project, and down payment for rehearsal space and other expenses.  We were able to put the money we raised to thus far to great use.  Thank you. 
We still need your generous assistance and support with raising more funds for this wonderful human rights project of one-act plays. This is a project of love for everyone involved in it.   However, it still takes money and your support to make it happen.  These are great plays that need to be seen.  Also, if you know one of the playwrights or other artists involved in the project, please help support them.   They have all worked very hard on it.
Some of our expenses.  include:  raising more money to help pay off the rest of the rental for the theatre, payment of the playbill, raising more money for material for costumes, sets, and props, stipends for actors, final payments for directors’ fees, sound designer’ fee, lighting’ designer’s fee, stage manger’s fee, publicist’s fee, along with other expenses, Your generous contributions will be put to great use. It will help us bring a high quality professional production.  Thank you for all of your support.
We would also like to be able to set aside some free tickets or discounted tickets for organizations of domestic violence, human rights and other such groups who would greatly benefit from the productions. Your support is needed to make all of this possible. Please spread the word.  Once again, thank you for everything.  Your support is very important.
Performances are scheduled for: June 22-24 and June 29-July 1 (additional dates will be added)

I am a senior at the University of Louisiana, and I have been chosen to direct this play as our student directed piece for the Department of Performing Arts. It will be performed at a charming intimate location in Downtown Lafayete, LA. A place with an emerging theater scene. Let me tell you a few things about the play I am putting.</p>
<p>When ""Proof"" by David Auburn came out in 2000, it was obviously a hit shown by the many awards it received including a Tony Award for best play. ""Proof"" portrays the struggle of a young woman to be her own person. For a long time, Catherine has been the caretaker of her father and now that he is dead she must find her own way while struggling under his last departing gift, the doubt of her sanity. One reason I believe that this play should be seen today is because there are so many young women and men out there trying to be their own person and not only be seen for what their family does. I have seen this a lot in Lafayette, Louisiana. I want to direct this play for them, the men and the women of this society who still feel under the pressure of their family in one way or another. So they know they aren’t the only ones going through this type of struggle.</p>
<p>The world of this play is the back porch of a rundown Chicago home. It is set in the realism of the character of Catherine and stays in the same location the entire time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The set is the biggest cost of the production so far. Right now it is almost impossible for us to build it without your help.</p>

<p>In short, $500 will be spent towards the set where the other $200 will be spent on costumes and props.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you about my story and why it means so much to me that this is the best production it can be. I have been in love with theater since 5th grade. I was in the play ""Little Abner"" and I was hooked. When I got to high school I was displaced to Plano, Texas due to Hurricane Katrina which destroyed my house. In Dallas, where I attended Ursuline Academy, I fell in love with the technical side of theater. Since then I have been involved in everything technical I could be. I worked backstage at the spring productions for my high school in New Orleans, LA when I returned and then came to University of Louisiana at Lafayette to get a Bachelor of Arts with a concentration in Stage Management. In the department I have stage managed six productions, designed the set of one, and worked in the scene shop on the past seven building the set, hanging lights, and helping set up sound equipment.</p>
<p>Now I am on to the area I didn't realize I would love. Directing. Last year I was taking a visual arts class when the last day I could I switched from that into Directing I. I fell in love with it! All of it, working with the actors, being able to mold the play to my vision, and so much more. I have directed four scenes in class and also was a part of the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival new playwright initiative this year which took a new ten minute, gave it to a director and gave them six rehearsals to get it done. The play I directed went on to the National level of the competition.</p>
<p>With the experience I have gained and being appointed to this task, I know this will be a success. Please donate what you can to my cause. I would love this play to be all it can be.</p></div>","My name is Kelsey LaCoste and I will be directing ""Proof"" by David Auburn this coming fall.

This award-winning fan favorite production has been painting Las Vegas bloody since 2011!<br/><br/><h3><b>FANS NEEDED TO HELP BRING OFFICIAL EVIL DEAD LIVE CAST RECORDING TO <strike>DEATH UNDEATH</strike> LIFE!</b></h3>

The creative team behind the longest-running production of the official live stage adaptation of the cult classic film trilogy EVIL DEAD is releasing a live CD.<br/><br/><b>100% authorized, 100% official, 100% demented!</b><br/><br/>

Because this is a live CD, in addition to the songs from the show, you will hear parts of the actual stage production. Live through the cheers and screams as 20 gallons of fresh warm blood spray over the Splatter Zone! Yell along with Ash's iconic lines, including the ""Boomstick"" speech! Feel the energy of the show pounding through your earholes as you listen (and sing) along!<br/><br/><h4><b>PUTTING YOUR CASH TO WORK!</b></h4>

Unlike a purely studio recording, a live CD has some unique elements that require extra care and attention, and we are working to ensure that every aspect of the sound is just right.<br/><br/>

We've been hard at work on this project for some time. The initial elements of the project have been recorded including the main performances, the audience participation, the fans, and the studio enhancement elements.<br/><br/>

Now we are in the home stretch which includes the editing, post production, and mastering phases of the process - as well as getting the CDs pressed.<br/><br/>

We are making sure everything is mixed properly, sounding right, and cleaned up so everyone who gets the CD in their hands can hear the quality of the recording and understand why we took as much time as we did to get this done. We are working with one of the best production facilities in the business to ensure the quality of the CD will be top-notch, and none of this happens for free.<br/><br/>

These funds will get the CD edited, mixed, and mastered, and get the first pressing in our hands.<br/><br/><h4><b>""SHENANIGANS!""</b></h4>

Sure, sure, maybe you've backed a crowd-funded project in the past and never heard back from them. Or maybe the finished product wasn't what you were expecting. This sort of risk is unavoidable when backing this sort of thing. So...how do you know supporting this project will actually lead to a finished product?<br/><br/>

1. For starters, we have been performing in Las Vegas since October of 2011 and have been on the Las Vegas Strip for 2 years. We've gone up against some of the biggest shows in town and have stood the test of time, all without their budgets, their stars, or their control of the local media. We've won awards, have fans coming from all over the world to party down with us, and we always deliver on what we set out to do.<br/><br/>

2. The main guts of the CD are done. All the recordings and basic structure are in place. This means the heavy lifting is over and the relatively easy part is left. One way or the other, the CD is going to be completed. The more funds we raise, the better the finished product will be.<br/><br/>

3. It's EVIL DEAD! This is the next best thing to being at the show, and we are excited to get this CD into our fans' hands!<br/><br/><h4><b>WHY YOU SHOULD CARE</b></h4>

Once released, <i>this CD will be a limited edition item available exclusively at the venue where our performances take place.</i> This means no matter where you live - as far as away as Australia or as close as California, you need to come to the show in Las Vegas to purchase the CD! You will NOT be able to buy it online, pick it up at Best Buy, or find it for download on iTunes.<br/><br/><b>If you do not come to our show, supporting this campaign and claiming one of the perks is the only way to get the CD!</b><br/><br/>

Not only will you get the CD, but we will do one step better by making sure it is autographed by the entire cast!<br/><br/><h4><b>OTHERS WAY TO HELP</b></h4>

I have always been able to make people laugh and to bring that to life with my writing, imagination, creativity and a great cast I know I can achieve anything. I started writing in grammar school when I wrote my very first play in the 8th grade.  I have been given a gift and know now it is my time to unfold it and share it with the world. My vision is way beyond just stage plays, I am writing my first novel and working in film and television. I would like for my audience to laugh more than cry. The world today is filled with so much violence and hate. My mission is not to remind my audience of death, hurt, pain and unhappy situations, but to make them remember what it was like to be happy and what made them smile. It is always good to focus on ways to address how to stop gun violence, to help our youth, poverty, teen pregnancy, drugs and gangs. I have addressed that through my productions. Sometimes we need our minds to be at ease and I deliver the message that GOD wants me to deliver. Yet and still, my message will be about everyday living with a few heart-felt sadness and tears.

<h3>About the Carnival</h3>
<p>The carnival itself is made up of a core group of performers and workers who believe in the value of live entertainment.  They want to bring back the old style carnival shows that used to travel North America bringing entertainment to small towns.  The idea is to bring together performers that have talent and who want to go professional but just need some more experience and take them to towns that have a lack of quality entertainment.  That way both benefit and great times would be had by all. </p>
<p>The plan is to build great performers and to give them the tools to better promote themselves so that one day they can make a living doing what they love.  We are looking for all types of performers to fill out our roster. Singers, acrobats, magicians, jugglers, musicians, stilt walkers, hula hoopers, fire performers, dancers and anything else that can be put on a stage that will entertain an audience.  All performers get a share of profits made as this is not a business per say, but a cooperative of entertainers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>The Financial Breakdown:</strong></p>
<p>As with all great projects we need to pay for the required equipment and that is why we are here.  We believe that there are people out there, possibly like yourself that want to support good talent and help bring live entertainment to those who don’t always have the chance to experience it.  So, here is what we need to pay for.</p>
<p>The carnival tent, this is by far the biggest expense. We have already sourced a few dealers to get the best value for cost.</p>
<p>Cargo trailer, for transporting the tent, props, seating, stage and everything else needed to put on an exceptional show.</p>
<p>Promo posters and handbills, to promote the show in the towns that we visit.</p>
<p>Generator, to power the sound and lights.</p>
<p>Materials to build the stage and audience seating.</p>
<p> We have already acquired much of the needed equipment.  Such as sound systems, lighting, trucks for hauling equipment and a tour bus for hauling people.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q and A</strong></p>
<p>Q: What will you do if you reach more than your goal of $25,000?</p>
<p>A: We will be adding more to the carnival to make it a better experience for all.  At $30,000 we will be investing into top notch medical gear and send our resident emergency medical responder for his first aid instructors course so that we can all stay up to date on our first aid.  At $40,000 we will be investing into a bunk RV so that our performers and workers have better accommodations as well as creating Carnival of Calamities T-shirts for all the backers that donated $50 or more.  At $50,000 we will be adding solar panels to the bus so that the carnival can be self powering without the need for a generator. </p>
<p>Q: Are you going to use all the funds for the carnival?</p>
<p>A: Yes.  This is a legitimate project that we have been working on for over half a year.  We plan to keep this venture going for many years so that we can benefit as many audiences and performers as possible.</p>
<p>Q: Is there any other way that you are raising funds?</p>
<p>A: Yes.  The core group is donating what they can to launch this project.  They have already put in over $20,000 themselves.  They are very dedicated to the dream.</p>
<p>Q: What kind of places does the carnival plan to visit.</p>

</div></div>","About the Carnival
The carnival itself is made up of a core group of performers and workers who believe in the value of live entertainment.  They want to bring back the old style carnival shows that used to travel North America bringing entertainment to small towns.  The idea is to bring together performers that have talent and who want to go professional but just need some more experience and take them to towns that have a lack of quality entertainment.  That way both benefit and great times would be had by all. 
The plan is to build great performers and to give them the tools to better promote themselves so that one day they can make a living doing what they love.  We are looking for all types of performers to fill out our roster. Singers, acrobats, magicians, jugglers, musicians, stilt walkers, hula hoopers, fire performers, dancers and anything else that can be put on a stage that will entertain an audience.  All performers get a share of profits made as this is not a business per say, but a cooperative of entertainers.


The Financial Breakdown:
As with all great projects we need to pay for the required equipment and that is why we are here.  We believe that there are people out there, possibly like yourself that want to support good talent and help bring live entertainment to those who don’t always have the chance to experience it.  So, here is what we need to pay for.
The carnival tent, this is by far the biggest expense. We have already sourced a few dealers to get the best value for cost.
Cargo trailer, for transporting the tent, props, seating, stage and everything else needed to put on an exceptional show.
Promo posters and handbills, to promote the show in the towns that we visit.
Generator, to power the sound and lights.
Materials to build the stage and audience seating.
 We have already acquired much of the needed equipment.  Such as sound systems, lighting, trucks for hauling equipment and a tour bus for hauling people.


 
Q and A
Q: What will you do if you reach more than your goal of $25,000?
A: We will be adding more to the carnival to make it a better experience for all.  At $30,000 we will be investing into top notch medical gear and send our resident emergency medical responder for his first aid instructors course so that we can all stay up to date on our first aid.  At $40,000 we will be investing into a bunk RV so that our performers and workers have better accommodations as well as creating Carnival of Calamities T-shirts for all the backers that donated $50 or more.  At $50,000 we will be adding solar panels to the bus so that the carnival can be self powering without the need for a generator. 
Q: Are you going to use all the funds for the carnival?
A: Yes.  This is a legitimate project that we have been working on for over half a year.  We plan to keep this venture going for many years so that we can benefit as many audiences and performers as possible.
Q: Is there any other way that you are raising funds?
A: Yes.  The core group is donating what they can to launch this project.  They have already put in over $20,000 themselves.  They are very dedicated to the dream.
Q: What kind of places does the carnival plan to visit.
A: We plan to find towns between the sizes of 2500 to 15,000 people all through the USA and Canada. We think that they would really enjoy having a carnival in town.
Q: What if people want to help but can’t afford to donate?
A: They can easily help by spreading the word to all of their friends.  The more people that know about it, the better the odds of the carnival getting the assistance it needs.

For the right donation, we will create an original vintage, fabric poster with your likeness and your carny name on it.  This is but one of the many possible perks that you can get by backing Dr. Von Houligan.

<p>We are currently developing and producing a puppet theatre piece that we have gotten the opportunity to present through the <strong>University of Maryland School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies Second Season</strong> on <strong>September 21 and 22 </strong>of this year. While we are allowed a budget through the university, the financial necessities of a fully costumed puppet production stretch beyond what the school can provide me. We are hoping that through this website, we will be able to fund this particular production, and then keep all of the puppets and costumes for future iterations and productions of the piece, which we hope to continue developing and working on well beyond our time at the university.</p>
<p>Here is a brief description of the show: <strong><em>Gretel</em> is an innovative take on the age-old fairy tale, <em>Hansel and Gretel</em>, that tells the story of a young girl dealing with a scary stepmother, an absent-minded brother, and an absent father. Set to Stravinsky's <em>Rite of Spring</em>, and featuring a fierce cast of nine incredibly talented women, this puppet-theatre production provides a haunting twist to the children's story, and explores profound themes of womanhood, sacrifice, and food - lots and lots of food.</strong></p>
<p>After just a few rehearsals with our artistic team, we can both already tell that this group of women is going to be a joy to work with and that this project is going to be an emotional journey for the artistic team as well as the audiences we are able to bring it to. Do check out the video above, which shows an improvised movement piece that Olivia had the pleasure of doing with one of our cast members, Moriamo Akibu, on the first day of rehearsal. As you can see, there are almost no costumes or puppets in the video, so see below to see what your contributions will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uniform suits for all of the actors</li>
<li>Masks for the actors</li>
<li>Puppet equipment including clay, papier-mâché, yarn, fabric, foam, etc.</li>
</ul><p>We are so very grateful for all of your support as our artistic journeys continue, and we thank you in advance for any contribution.</p>

There exists a generation—perhaps multiple—of Canadians, sons and daughters of immigrants who have grown up in this country feeling similarly. We carry with us the traditions and cultures of our parents, but we grow up in a western, Caucasian society. In this context we are recognized as ‘ethnic’ or ‘exotic’. Yet, at the same time we are removed from our heritage, because we were raised apart from it. The current multicultural theatre scene often offers up the immigrant story. Though I am an immigrant, technically speaking, mine is one that is a step beyond this. I want to make theatre that represents a new generation, a story that is told from their mixed, identity confused Canadian children. </p></div>
<h1><span style=""font-size: 18.6666660308838px; line-height: 26px;"">COLLISION - A VISION</span></h1>
<p></p>
<p> This solo show will explore the separation of the self and one’s country through discovering commonalities and universal truths about who we are as human beings, beyond our culture, beyond our appearance, and beyond our beliefs. What can we still communicate without sharing a common language? What separates us, and what makes us the same? What makes us who we are, our environment or our origins. Or Both? <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>WHY MANIPUR AND MONTREAL?</b></h4>
<p>In India, Manipuri and other North Eastern Indian people are being violently attacked, abused and killed based on their race. This has sparked a nationwide protest for the justice of these lives, and a growing concern for the need of anti-racism laws (India Broadcast News, 2014). Case after case of North Eastern people being attacked, raped and/or killed in hate-crime race related attacks is forcing Manipuris to fear for their safety. This violence is profoundly disturbing and it has forced me to take action. What is a Manipuri’s identity if their own country refuses to accept them because of their race? What will happen to their culture if they reject their country, as their country rejects them? Will this lead to separation?</p>
<p>Living in Montreal I have witnessed the passion that many French Canadians have for their culture and it comes to a head at this very word ’separation’. A topic that is both taboo and yet cried out in the form of “Liberté” with banging drums and marching protests through the streets of Montreal. This play does not aim to take a stance on the political interests of separatist supporters. It will, however, provide a platform for discussion on what might happen to the cultural identity of Quebec should they one day achieve separation.</p>

life and times of Civil Right Leader and American Icon Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p><p>
</p><p>I HAVE A DREAM covers the civil
rights moment with Dr. King from December 1, 1955 (when Rosa Parks refused to
move to the back of the bus) until April 4, 1968 (the day Martin Luther King
transitioned). There are 28 songs, 120 projections, a mass choir, and
over 20 actors, singers, and dancers in the production. The production will
touch on the audience's intellectual, spiritual, and emotional senses. It is a
perfect vehicle to entertain, inspire and add perspective to our American

TheatreSouth is a registered Georgia Not For Profit touring theatre company.We are embarking on a historically significant Multicultural
Theatre Production / Broadway play ""I HAVE A DREAM"" written by Josh Greenfeld,
directed by Herman LeVern Jones. The project is a historical production based on the
life and times of Civil Right Leader and American Icon Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
I HAVE A DREAM covers the civil
rights moment with Dr. King from December 1, 1955 (when Rosa Parks refused to
move to the back of the bus) until April 4, 1968 (the day Martin Luther King
transitioned). There are 28 songs, 120 projections, a mass choir, and
over 20 actors, singers, and dancers in the production. The production will
touch on the audience's intellectual, spiritual, and emotional senses. It is a
perfect vehicle to entertain, inspire and add perspective to our American
history. We need your support in making
this project successful.

Our background.  Our Artistic Director earned his M.A. and Ph.D. in theatre; our President earned his M.F.A. in technical theatre; two other members of our board have graduate degrees in theatre.   A willingness to take risks with our content - an Erie theatre blog's 3 most shocking plays of 2013 were all Laugh/Riot shows. 
""Bedtime Stories"" hits all of the keys that sets us apart.  This devised piece shows 7 sets of people in the most intimate and private space they have.    What We Need & What You Get Here's what we need to get us on the road:
Application and production fees: $275-$575 for the Chicago Fringe Festival (depending on the amount of times we'd like to perform; $200 for Pittsburgh Fringe Festival; none for Buffalo Infringement and Gannon (Erie, PA) Fringe Festival; total $475-775.

 Here's what you'll get for helping us get there:
The eternal gratitude of our performers.  If that's not enough, how about acknowledgment in our season's programs; a video of our travels; tickets to our performances; and a chance to join us onstage to introduce our production.

  The Impact Why should you donate to this project?  Glad you asked: 
You get the chance to help these artists gain national exposure. You help bring Laugh/Riot's unique aesthetic to new markets.  Previous productions have all been lauded for their distinctive staging. You can help bring more national attention to northwest PA's growing arts scene. 
  Risks & Challenges How can we guarantee that we'll be able to perform at these festivals?
By having the funds to apply during the ""early bird"" period for Pittsburgh and Chicago, we can guarantee performance opportunities before they are determined by a lottery process.  Buffalo Infringement Festival is committed to accepting all applicants.
We are already working with the Gannon Fringe Festival to ensure performance space, either at the festival proper or at a satellite venue.
   Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't contribute monetarily, there are plenty of ways you can help: 
Get the word out and make some noise about this campaign!  The more people talking about it, the more likely we'll reach people who support our goal. Indiegogo's share tools make it easy to let people know about this in a variety of ways.

</div><p>One year ago today, November 7, 2013, a new play called Sun and Room premiered at Fort Lewis College’s intimate black box theatre. A few months later, in February 2014, that play was featured at the Regional VIII Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival in Los Angeles. And now, this coming January 2015, that same play - with its original cast and crew - will premiere in NEW YORK CITY. </p><blockquote>THREE WHOLE WEEKS.<br/><span>SIXTEEN SHOWS.<br/>At the beautiful PARADISE FACTORY THEATRE on 4th Street.<br/>This is the chance of a lifetime.<br/>And we need YOUR HELP to make it happen. </span>

<p class=""Lead-inEmphasis""><span class=""Lead-inEmphasis"">A group of professional actors, the Traveling Players take a</span> family-friendly approach to Shakespeare.<span style="""">  </span>We make Shakespeare's comedies accessible by presenting them in an outdoor setting and carefully cutting them to run in the kid-friendly time frame of about an hour.  Our performances are always free!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><em>As You Like It</em>, The Traveling Players’ 2013 summer production in Hamlin Park, encompasses a style of presentation that emulates Shakespeare’s time as much as possible.<span style="""">  </span>The minimal set design, contemporary costumes, limited amplification, live contemporary music and close proximity to audience members are an attempt to give a modern audience something akin to what Shakespeare’s own audiences may have experienced.<span style="""">  </span>Add to that a healthy dose of irreverence and modern sensibility, and you have The Traveling Players’ brand of theater.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We need funds in order to pay our company members for their hard work and dedication and reimburse them for the money they've spent on props, costumes, and set pieces.</p>
<p>Without ticket sales these professional artists are relying entirely on the generous contributions of those who support our vision of Shakespeare in the Park.  We are committed to paying stipends to all of the artists in our company and those we bring in to work with us.  Help us inspire a younger generation by introducing them to the power of quality live theater!</p>
<p>We are offering four different levels of Perks to our audience members, ranging from a Facebook shout out to a picnic lunch for four during a performance of As You Like It!  <br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your generous support allows us to realize our goal of sharing Shakespeare with the masses.  Please consider donating and sharing this indiegogo page with your friends and family members.  With your help we hope to have a huge turn out in Hamlin Park this summer, and pave the way for future work by the Traveling Players!</p>

A group of professional actors, the Traveling Players take a family-friendly approach to Shakespeare.  We make Shakespeare's comedies accessible by presenting them in an outdoor setting and carefully cutting them to run in the kid-friendly time frame of about an hour.  Our performances are always free!


As You Like It, The Traveling Players’ 2013 summer production in Hamlin Park, encompasses a style of presentation that emulates Shakespeare’s time as much as possible.  The minimal set design, contemporary costumes, limited amplification, live contemporary music and close proximity to audience members are an attempt to give a modern audience something akin to what Shakespeare’s own audiences may have experienced.  Add to that a healthy dose of irreverence and modern sensibility, and you have The Traveling Players’ brand of theater.
What We Need & What You Get


We need funds in order to pay our company members for their hard work and dedication and reimburse them for the money they've spent on props, costumes, and set pieces.
Without ticket sales these professional artists are relying entirely on the generous contributions of those who support our vision of Shakespeare in the Park.  We are committed to paying stipends to all of the artists in our company and those we bring in to work with us.  Help us inspire a younger generation by introducing them to the power of quality live theater!
We are offering four different levels of Perks to our audience members, ranging from a Facebook shout out to a picnic lunch for four during a performance of As You Like It!  
The Impact
Your generous support allows us to realize our goal of sharing Shakespeare with the masses.  Please consider donating and sharing this indiegogo page with your friends and family members.  With your help we hope to have a huge turn out in Hamlin Park this summer, and pave the way for future work by the Traveling Players!

<li>Paying the Stage Manager (A man who can run lights, video and sound all by himself while still being totally cool and helpful to super-stressed out dancers deserves to be paid!)</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ultimately, The Damsels Dance Company would like to try and get these costs covered so that our ticket sales (and any extra donations we might get, hint hint :D) can go toward our goal of helping young dancers afford a quality dance education. We love dance as a sport, as a lifestyle, and as an art, but the reality is that good dance education is a big financial commitment. If we can lessen the financial burden for some young dancers, we can ensure that dance can enhance and brighten their futures in the same way it has done and continues to do for us as professionals. </p>

<h3>About Hedwig and the Angry Inch</h3>
<p>This groundbreaking Obie-winning Off-Broadway smash also won multiple awards for its hit film adaptation. It tells the story of ""internationally ignored song stylist"" Hedwig Schmidt, a fourth-wall smashing East German rock 'n' roll goddess who also happens to be the victim of a botched sex-change operation, which has left her with just ""an angry inch."" This outrageous and unexpectedly hilarious story is dazzlingly performed by Hedwig (née Hansel) in the form of a rock gig/stand-up comedy routine backed by the hard-rocking band ""The Angry Inch."" Using songs and monologues, Hedwig tells her story, which began in the former East Berlin where as Hansel he meets Luther, an American GI who promises to take the young man to the States on the condition that he switch his sex. After the bungled operation, Luther abandons newly named Hedwig in a Kansas trailer park where she turns to music and meets geeky Tommy Speck, whom she takes under her wing and soon falls for. Tommy steals her songs, achieves rock star fame, and Hedwig is once again cast aside. She decides to demand redress and stalks Tommy's world tour, performing in the T.G.I. Friday's that are situated next door to his stadiums. Hedwig describes her life's search for ""The Origin of Love"" and her other half. It's a rocking ride, funny, touching and ultimately inspiring to anyone who has felt life gave them an inch when they deserved a mile.<br/></p>

<h3>Why I Chose <i>Hedwig</i>
</h3>
<p>I believe that <i>Hedwig</i> is a perfect fit for this project for two reasons;</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>I grew up in a small town in Central New York. We did not, by any means, have a diverse population, and as a result, I was almost completely unaware of the wide variety of lifestyles there are in the world. Coming to Oswego was a bit of a culture shock, but one I embraced. Coming to college, I had a very limited view of the world, I had very little knowledge of other cultures, regional differences in our own country, and the idea that there was more to gender than just being a man or woman astounded me. I believe that <i>Hedwig</i> is a celebration of that diversity that I found here, in Oswego. </li>
<li>Going away to college and choosing a major are probably the two biggest decisions I have made in my young life. In a strange way, this is a lot alike Hedwig's decision to get a sex change and come to the US with a guy he barely knew. Though our situations are completely different, we both made life changing decisions and had expectations of what the results would be. Much alike Hedwig, my expectations were way off, but in the end, what we got is better than anything we could have dreamed of.</li>
</ol>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <ul>
<li>Scripts, Rentals &amp; Rights- In order to perform the show, we must buy the scripts, rent the scores and pay royalty fees.</li>
<li>Costumes- While there are only two characters in this show, their costumes cannot be plain. There is also an onstage band that must be costumed appropriately as well.</li> <li>Wigs &amp; Makeup- Both characters in this show are cross dressed, so both actors will need wigs. Also, due to the Glam Rock style of this show, the makeup demands are heavy.</li>
<li>Scenic- While <i>Hedwig</i> does not require much on the scenic end, we will need projections and some small scenic pieces. </li>
<li>Props- There are not many props required, but Hedwig does use a few things that she made or found in her travels.</li>

Going away to college and choosing a major are probably the two biggest decisions I have made in my young life. In a strange way, this is a lot alike Hedwig's decision to get a sex change and come to the US with a guy he barely knew. Though our situations are completely different, we both made life changing decisions and had expectations of what the results would be.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Marc Bogaerts, a critically acclaimed Belgian choreographer who has become renowned for his unconventional combinations of physical expression to create dynamic and complex performances. On November 11, 2018 Marc Bogaerts, in partnership with EOS Cultural Events &amp; IESA, will present S.P.O.R.T - Sans Barrière , a showcase highlighting his next piece that aims to bring about greater recognition to societal perceptions and reception of disabled people through the Paralympic Games and explore how dance and art transcend perceptions of ability. This one night only event will bring together specialists and artists working in this sector to begin a dialogue in preparation for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
<p>For the past decade, Bogaerts has been in working in close collaboration with Olympic and Paralympic athletes to create new works that bring art and sport together. Through these pieces he is able to meld the physical vocabulary of sport and dance, allowing the viewer to see the athlete as a dancer with their movements taking on new symbolism and grace, and the dancer as an athlete whose full training gets to be on display. This combination of genres combined with their innate ability to build community, make Bogaerts work ideal for the Paris 2024 Games as the Olympic Committee begins to plan accompanying events for the 2024 games in the city. The first step to reaching this larger goal is to begin doing outreach through showcases and workshops like this. </p>

</div></div>","The Spot was founded in September of 2014 as a new performing
arts studio for the Wood River Valley. Having spent several summers working
with theaters in the area, Peter Burke, Kevin Wade, Yanna Lantz, and Brett
Moellenberg opened up shop to continue fostering arts education for the youth
of the Valley and to create a new venue for all kinds of performance and visual
art. 










We've recently learned that the
""assembly use"" portion of our business, namely shows with audiences
(that's you!), are not permitted in the Light Industrial District where we are
located. Because of this, The Spot needs to apply for a text amendment and Permitted/Conditional
Use Permit to continue bringing our cutting edge style of theatre to the
Valley. 


Why We Need You!



The costs associated include
an application fee and retainer for the city's lawyers. In addition, once we are
able to get the amendment passed, we have a wish-list of items for The Spot (including seating/lighting equipment) that we will implement to truly
transform our space into our vision – a community hub for artistic growth and transformation. 




Since closing our groundbreaking and completely sold-out production of
""Next to Normal"" in January, we have been excited to continue
building what will become a destination for artists and audiences across the
country. Your contribution is an investment in youthful, vibrant art in your
community; and, we are proud to call this place our home.The Future Goal...

More plays, musicals, events, live music shows, dance parties and as many artistic assemblies for the community as possible! 
Since we had already secured rights to mount the Tony Award winning comedy ""25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,"" July 29-August 9 2015, prior to news of our current permitted use as stated in the city's bylaws, we have been granted permission by the city to continue production. We would love to see you in the audience.

A Hotel in Eden will be presented as part of the festival on October 3rd and 5th at 9PM, and on October 8th at 3:30PM. All performances will take place at the Hudson Guild Theatre at 441 W. 26th Street. Tickets can be purchased through Brown Paper Tickets at: http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2582682 We are seeking $1,000 for our production fund, so this play can be introduced to the public in the proper way. As a team, we are devoted to paying our artists for their efforts. This is the majority of our production cost. Outside of that, paying for rehearsal spaces in New York is a challenge we continue to face. Finally, the funds will be used to promote the show and the festival to the people of New York City.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

A flying accident dashes his hopes of becoming a pilot but he seizes the opportunity to become a navigator and put in to practice his passion for astronomy and the stars. Forming a strong bond with his pilot Pip, their air gunner Jamie, wireless operator Don, and the rest of the crew, they thrill at the wonder of flying and seize every opportunity to live life to the full at the local pubs and at parties.</p><p>Romance blossoms, although not everyone’s relationship flourishes amidst the context of war. WAAF Marion, nurse Annie, and Land Girl Helen have to decide if they will risk agonising heartache and sorrow and love someone who may go missing in action any day.</p><p> When Max and the crew, flying Lancasters, begin bombing operations over Germany they are forced to confront fear, death, and the harsh realities of war, putting a strain on the crew bond and their personal romantic relationships. Eventually the crew fail to return from a raid and while they fight for survival, having ditched in the North Sea, the wives and girlfriends wait anxiously for news.</p><p>'The Navigator' is a story of the human spirit – ambition, hope, youthfulness, friendship, romance and love – fighting to survive the maelstrom of total war.</p><p><u><strong>Crowdfunding Outline</strong></u></p><p>With the script and lyrics written, and the music composed, The Navigator creative team of Michael Vivian (co-writer, lyricist and director), Glenn Tollett (composer, lyricist and arranger), and Steve Darlow (co-writer and historian) are thrilled to have been given the opportunity to put on two concert presentations of The Navigator. The first, on 19th November 2017 will be staged in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, and give us an opportunity to gauge the reaction of an audience. The second presentation at a London venue, in the following week, will be to theatre professionals, with a view to establishing a partnership with a producer and achieve our goal of a full touring production.</p><p>To stage these presentations, we need your help. In particular we are asking for your support to fund certain elements, namely:</p><p>Rehearsal Space Rental. An estimated cost of £1,500 to carry out the rehearsals with our cast of 13 actors.</p><p>Musical Arrangements. We are budgeting for around £2,500 to cover the cost of musical arrangements, utilising copyists, and bringing on board a Musical Director.</p><p>Sound Design. The sounds of The Navigator will be a major part of the audience experience, so we are looking to enlist a sound designer and hire the required equipment, budgeting £1,500.</p><p>Lighting. To capture the mood of the period we will need special lighting equipment – budget £1,500.</p><p>Staffing. £3,124 has been budgeted for the employment of staff at each of our presentation venues, along with a Production Manager and Deputy Stage Manager.</p><p>Image Sourcing and Filming. £1,000 will allow us to source images to support the show and cover the cost of filming and then editing the presentations.</p><p>Marketing. £2,200 will enable us to spread the word about The Navigator, and produce the music demos.</p><p>Note: Reaching our Target of £13,324 will only cover just under one half of our total budget for The Navigator.</p><p>With your donation you can receive acknowledgement of your support to this historic project, a copy of the song demos recorded with West End performers, a signed letter of thanks from the creative team and a Bomber Command veteran, sheet music signed by the composer, lyricist and performer, a veteran signed copy of a hardback Bomber Command book, and two tickets to the Letchworth presentation and an invitation to the subsequent champagne reception.</p><p>We have great belief in the theatrical, indeed historical, potential of The Navigator. – a story of a few of the young men who risked their lives in the cause of freedom.

A flying accident dashes his hopes of becoming a pilot but he seizes the opportunity to become a navigator and put in to practice his passion for astronomy and the stars. Forming a strong bond with his pilot Pip, their air gunner Jamie, wireless operator Don, and the rest of the crew, they thrill at the wonder of flying and seize every opportunity to live life to the full at the local pubs and at parties.Romance blossoms, although not everyone’s relationship flourishes amidst the context of war. WAAF Marion, nurse Annie, and Land Girl Helen have to decide if they will risk agonising heartache and sorrow and love someone who may go missing in action any day. When Max and the crew, flying Lancasters, begin bombing operations over Germany they are forced to confront fear, death, and the harsh realities of war, putting a strain on the crew bond and their personal romantic relationships. Eventually the crew fail to return from a raid and while they fight for survival, having ditched in the North Sea, the wives and girlfriends wait anxiously for news.'The Navigator' is a story of the human spirit – ambition, hope, youthfulness, friendship, romance and love – fighting to survive the maelstrom of total war.Crowdfunding OutlineWith the script and lyrics written, and the music composed, The Navigator creative team of Michael Vivian (co-writer, lyricist and director), Glenn Tollett (composer, lyricist and arranger), and Steve Darlow (co-writer and historian) are thrilled to have been given the opportunity to put on two concert presentations of The Navigator. The first, on 19th November 2017 will be staged in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, and give us an opportunity to gauge the reaction of an audience. The second presentation at a London venue, in the following week, will be to theatre professionals, with a view to establishing a partnership with a producer and achieve our goal of a full touring production.To stage these presentations, we need your help. In particular we are asking for your support to fund certain elements, namely:Rehearsal Space Rental. An estimated cost of £1,500 to carry out the rehearsals with our cast of 13 actors.Musical Arrangements. We are budgeting for around £2,500 to cover the cost of musical arrangements, utilising copyists, and bringing on board a Musical Director.Sound Design. The sounds of The Navigator will be a major part of the audience experience, so we are looking to enlist a sound designer and hire the required equipment, budgeting £1,500.Lighting. To capture the mood of the period we will need special lighting equipment – budget £1,500.Staffing. £3,124 has been budgeted for the employment of staff at each of our presentation venues, along with a Production Manager and Deputy Stage Manager.Image Sourcing and Filming. £1,000 will allow us to source images to support the show and cover the cost of filming and then editing the presentations.Marketing. £2,200 will enable us to spread the word about The Navigator, and produce the music demos.Note: Reaching our Target of £13,324 will only cover just under one half of our total budget for The Navigator.With your donation you can receive acknowledgement of your support to this historic project, a copy of the song demos recorded with West End performers, a signed letter of thanks from the creative team and a Bomber Command veteran, sheet music signed by the composer, lyricist and performer, a veteran signed copy of a hardback Bomber Command book, and two tickets to the Letchworth presentation and an invitation to the subsequent champagne reception.We have great belief in the theatrical, indeed historical, potential of The Navigator. – a story of a few of the young men who risked their lives in the cause of freedom. It is to those gallant men that The Navigator is dedicated and we thank you for taking time to consider the project.Inspiration behind the StoryThe Navigator is based on inspiring true-life accounts and events.

</div></div>","Our Story
Mission:  We strive to examine the beautiful human struggle for meaning through all its awkward, broken, obscene and ugly fragments.
Crashbox Theater Company was born from the hearts and minds of eighteen individuals who traveled from all corners of the world to train in NYC at Atlantic Acting School Conservatory.  Inspired by the bravery and work of past and present theater artists and playwrights, we hope to become a vibrant part of the theater world and contribute to its growth.  Under the guidance and allowed budget of Atlantic, we were given artistic freedom to launch our first production as a company, “Orange Flower Water” by Craig Wright.  Freshly graduated and with that priceless learning experience under our belts, we are ready to step out from under the Atlantic umbrella and launch our first independent production this fall.
 
The Project
We are extremely happy to announce that our fall production will be two short plays by award-winning dramatist Kyle John Schmidt. 
 “Saint Matilde’s Malady” – written entirely in trochaic verse- humorously explores the romantic entanglements of Prostitutes and Pirates; poses questions on socially acceptable relationships and the existence of true love. 
 “The Last Hat:  a Tragedy” is the winner of the Actors Theatre 2010 Heideman Award.  It tells a tragic tale of the troubles that come from letting trivial illusions take on greater importance than bravely speaking the truth.
 
The Impact

As a company, we look to build a platform that will be a collaboration of artists and playwrights who are passionate about keeping the art of storytelling alive and progressive.  Our first production out in the “real world” certainly won’t be our last.  However, we are a young company and the contributions you make here will have an extremely positive effect on how far we are able to go with this first step.   A successful fall production will help us cultivate an audience and provide funds for a winter and/or spring production.  
 

What We Need 
Space.  The majority of funds raised here will go towards rental space for rehearsals and performances.  Modest theater spaces with adequate equipment in New York run aprox. $2,500.00/month.
Additional funds will be put towards the production in the following areas:
-Design Budget
                -Props
                -Set
                -Costumes 
                -Lighting
                -Sound
-Marketing
                -Posters
                -Programs
-Healthy snacks and hydration for cast and crew during the run of performances.
 
What you Get
Besides our eternal love and admiration, we have provided perks for contributions made.  We understand that financial times are tough and wish our perks could be more lush.  Although modest, the perks are given with loads of gratitude for anything you're able to contribute.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
-Become our “Friend”and “Follow” us!  Find Crashbox Theater Company on Facebook and Twitter to stay posted on current and future happenings.
-Get the word out!  If you like what we’re doing, kindly let people know where to find us.
-Volunteer!   We are always looking for help in everything from designing (props, lights, sound, costumes, set) to fundraising to box office.  Even if you’re just dying to take a paint brush to a stage set, let us know!  (Please send an email to meridith_jones1@hotmail.com if you’re interested in volunteering.)
-Submit!  We are always accepting new plays, so if you have them, send them!  (Please send submissions to thomas.muccioli@yahoo.com )

<p><b>THE IMPACT:</b></p>
<p><b><i>RDT: Embrace the Unexpected</i> </b>is about making meaning for our
audiences and the community we call home. It’s what makes us revolutionary even
after 50 years of ""dancing the trail.""  Unlike
other companies, the diverse nature of our dance collection allows us to
pair what's happening now with what happened then in ways you won’t see coming.</p>
<p>Repertory Dance Theatre is about grace and athleticism, beauty
and power.  We are about ART: art in
motion, expressed through our bodies as dance. Art that in its immediacy and intimacy can be both thrilling and
profound.</p>
<p>We were hugely successful in raising over $7,500 last summer to help
fund the commission of “<b>By The Snake,"" </b>created just for RDT by Noa Zuk and Ohad Fishof.  This work went on to be lauded by the <i>Salt

<p><b>RISKS &amp;
CHALLENGES:</b></p>
<p>Modern dance can be misunderstood.  Like modern visual art, we don’t necessarily
tell a story with a linear plot. We  comment on the world through abstraction.  We allow our artistic vision to take
shape in mysterious forms and figures.  We
think this mystery is very exciting but we can’t offer you a black- and-white description of what you'll see.  What we CAN
offer you is art that is visceral; art that moves you on a deeper level; art
that raises questions, provokes and inspires. </p>
<p>Our 2015-2016 season is an ambitious one.  With 7 new dance works being added to our
collection, we are doing more than ever before. We are pushing ourselves to acquire new choreography that will stand
alongside work we already have to help us tell a unique and powerful story.  </p>
<p>We need your help to make sure this story is
told--our collective story.</p>
<p>We will direct whatever funds we raise
toward the acquisition of these works.   Reaching our goal will inspire RDT and our stakeholders to ensure the future of the Company. Your donation in any amount will help.  </p>
