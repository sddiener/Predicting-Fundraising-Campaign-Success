<p>The Chabot College Planetarium is not just an educational venue for our students, it’s an Astronomy and Science based Educational classroom for our Community. In years past Chabot College Planetarium was one of the premier college planetarium in the San Francisco Bay area. We were once funded to teach and hold ongoing planetarium shows for all, from young children to older adults, and for local school groups of all ages.</p>
<p>That was then and this is now. We are no longer funded to provide the public element of our mission, so vital to our community. So that is why we are coming to you, to help us to transition back to providing personnel and programs that will engage the vast community of everyone interested in</p>
<p>Astronomy and Science, from kids to seniors.</p>
<p>We currently provide an exceptional simulated view of the sky in our 30-foot dome provided by our all-digital Spitz SciDome projector. With this state-of-the-art projector, along with exceptional software we are able to produce realistic images of Planets, Stars, and Galaxies along with video in a truly immersive environment.</p>
<p>We, the Friends of the Chabot College Planetarium, are asking for your contribution so that we can help the Planetarium accomplish its original mission.</p>
<p>Please donate and you too will be one of the True Stars of Our Community!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We need your help so that as the Spring of 2013 begins, our doors will be open with new programs and an individual to run them for the fiscal quarter. We are hoping to build an endowment that might support the planetarium in perpetuity. But for now, working together, we can again bring the wonder of Astronomy to our Bay Area community. Achieving our $35,000 funding goal will help to meet two critical needs:</p>
<p>1. <em>Providing a Public-Program Planetarium Director:</em></p>
<p>A person who will coordinate, organize, and lead classes and public programs in Astronomy and Science for the Planetarium, working with the current full-time faculty of the college.</p>
<p><br/> 2. <em>Provide Planetarium Needs:</em></p>
<p>There are many challenges ahead and much to be done to accomplish our goals. Our wish list is great, but not unobtainable. Your generous contribution will help us bring back our outreach efforts by enabling us to:</p>
<p>• Purchase materials for new program development (new fulldome films and outreach materials for science activities).</p>
<p>• Expand and enhance our team allowing us to increase our impact and increase  number of community visitors and students we serve.</p>
<p>• Provide training for Chabot students interested in learning the audio visual instrumentation used in our planetarium, so that they can produce programs that will be seen and enjoyed by the greater community.</p>
<p><strong><br/> The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The impact will be enormous. Carl Sagan once said “I can find in my undergraduate classes, bright students who do not know that the stars rise and set at night, or even that the Sun is a star.” We want to make sure our students and our community know at least the basics of astronomy, and hopefully much more about the solar system, the stars,  and the universe in which they live.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>In 2010, two local teachers (Mwaniki and Cecilia) rescued these 7 children from the Majengo slums and were determined to give them a proper home despite their own meager salaries.  They rented a small house just minutes from Kanoga Primary School in Nyeri and hired a local woman as a live-in caretaker.  While they have given all they have, the home is still lacking essentials such as water and electricity.  Currently the children are carrying home a limited amount of water from the school and are sharing one paraffin lamp amongst the 8 of them (including the caretaker).  Without a sufficient supply of water, the children suffer from ringworm as they cannot properly bathe or wash their sheets.  While Bonface still remains number one in his class, the others are beginning to struggle with the sun setting at 6pm and no light to study by. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>After much discussion with the teachers we have determined that $500 per child would be enough to pay for food, school fees, rent and necessities for one year.  This money could also be put towards a number of items including...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) A water tank and pipes to catch and store the rainwater running off the roof     </div>
<div>2) A fence around the property to further ensure the children's safety</div>
<div>3) A paraffin lamp</div>
<div>4) Fertilizer for their garden</div>
<div>5) Firewood</div>
<div>6) Tutors for the children (1 hour per day for all 7 children only amounts to $28 per week). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A small donation can make a big difference in the lives of these children and I encourage everyone to get involved.  I realize that money is tight for many these days, so if you cannot donate please contribute by passing this message along to friends and family. </div>

<p>The young man paused, looked up, and replied “Throwing starfish into the ocean.”</p>
<p>The old man smiled, and said, “I must ask, then, why are you throwing starfish into the ocean?”</p>
<p>To this, the young man replied, “The sun is up and the tide is going out. If I don’t throw them in, they’ll die.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, the elderly observer commented, “But, young man, do you not realise that there are miles and miles of beach and there are starfish all along every mile? You can’t possibly make a difference!”</p>

<p><em>“The battle for the kind heart is never won; it must be fought steadily with every child, with every person, with ever new generation.”</em> Captain Will Judy, Founder of <em>National Dog Week</em> – 1949</p>
<p><strong>As Hurricane Sandy knocks at our doors and minds, please take care of your people and pets. Thankfully, government agencies have learned from the past and most shelters will welcome your pets. Be safe please.</strong></p>
<p>National Dog Week has come and gone and we thank all who have joined in our campaign by contributing and sharing the NDW Story. The Paws to Pose cameras are returning and we can't wait to see some great shots of dogs celebrating their special week across America. The Likes on our Face Book Community Page more than doubled, too. Thank you America for helping us spread the bark about our unique canine heritage!</p>
<p>For over twenty years I’ve preserved the past using vintage postcards as a central focus of my unique artwork. The beautiful images of these cards that date from the early 1900s are extended onto their mats in a painterly fashion leaving their unique provenance uncompromised.</p>
<p>In fact, it was a series of poignant black and white postcards depicting dogs and cats that inspired me to start writing. Viewing these moving works of art published over 100 years ago, it struck me that the desire to help our Companion Animals remains a constant and that through the use of the creative process, the message can be powerful and enduring.</p>
<p>These images coupled with my growing curiosity about something called the <em>National Dog Week Movement,</em> fueled my writing career. <em>National Dog Week</em> was established by Captain William Judy in 1928. Judy, who published <em>Dog World Magazine</em> for several decades, set aside the last full week of September to officially honor the nation’s dogs.  Long before their official use, Judy was a champion of military and police dog forces and believed they deserved an organized period of recognition.</p>
<p>My blog was established over two years ago to give this special seven days the relevance it deserves and has introduced me to many incredible people who have made significant changes in the way our Companion Animals are treated.</p>
<p>Today, I am asking you all to help me in my work. The funding I receive will go to the creation of a new website that celebrates the dog-human bond through great literary works, music, painting and more, in the manner Captain Judy intended. It will also help me to promote the positive work of organizations such as Project Pets – Spay, Neuter, Love and Covers for Critters and projects like <em>Paws to Pose</em>.</p>
<p>This year’s <em>National Dog Week</em> Project, <em>Paws to Pose</em>, has dog-lovers throughout the nation capturing the spirit of the American Dog through photos and a journal kept during the week of September 24<sup>th</sup>. In time, and with more support,  these projects will expand to include many more participants.</p>
<p>HELP GIVE A VENERABLE, MEANINGFUL OBSERVANCE ITS DUE!</p>
<p>If you appreciate and respect man’s best friend, and other loving Companion Animals, enjoy great books and works of art and want to help preserve the integrity of <em>National Dog Week</em> I hope you will fuel my passion.

</div></div>","“The battle for the kind heart is never won; it must be fought steadily with every child, with every person, with ever new generation.” Captain Will Judy, Founder of National Dog Week – 1949
As Hurricane Sandy knocks at our doors and minds, please take care of your people and pets. Thankfully, government agencies have learned from the past and most shelters will welcome your pets. Be safe please.
National Dog Week has come and gone and we thank all who have joined in our campaign by contributing and sharing the NDW Story. The Paws to Pose cameras are returning and we can't wait to see some great shots of dogs celebrating their special week across America. The Likes on our Face Book Community Page more than doubled, too. Thank you America for helping us spread the bark about our unique canine heritage!
For over twenty years I’ve preserved the past using vintage postcards as a central focus of my unique artwork. The beautiful images of these cards that date from the early 1900s are extended onto their mats in a painterly fashion leaving their unique provenance uncompromised.
In fact, it was a series of poignant black and white postcards depicting dogs and cats that inspired me to start writing. Viewing these moving works of art published over 100 years ago, it struck me that the desire to help our Companion Animals remains a constant and that through the use of the creative process, the message can be powerful and enduring.
These images coupled with my growing curiosity about something called the National Dog Week Movement, fueled my writing career. National Dog Week was established by Captain William Judy in 1928. Judy, who published Dog World Magazine for several decades, set aside the last full week of September to officially honor the nation’s dogs.  Long before their official use, Judy was a champion of military and police dog forces and believed they deserved an organized period of recognition.
My blog was established over two years ago to give this special seven days the relevance it deserves and has introduced me to many incredible people who have made significant changes in the way our Companion Animals are treated.
Today, I am asking you all to help me in my work. The funding I receive will go to the creation of a new website that celebrates the dog-human bond through great literary works, music, painting and more, in the manner Captain Judy intended. It will also help me to promote the positive work of organizations such as Project Pets – Spay, Neuter, Love and Covers for Critters and projects like Paws to Pose.
This year’s National Dog Week Project, Paws to Pose, has dog-lovers throughout the nation capturing the spirit of the American Dog through photos and a journal kept during the week of September 24th. In time, and with more support,  these projects will expand to include many more participants.
HELP GIVE A VENERABLE, MEANINGFUL OBSERVANCE ITS DUE!
If you appreciate and respect man’s best friend, and other loving Companion Animals, enjoy great books and works of art and want to help preserve the integrity of National Dog Week I hope you will fuel my passion. It really is all about tapping the well of compassion and positive energy in humankind.
Even the smallest donation will help. Thank you.

<p>Salutations! I'm Bobbi Roque Hornik - a music teacher in Northern Manitoba, Canada.<em> I love getting kids excited and inspired about music</em>.  Many of our students come from homes where music is simply not an option.  The only place these kids get to experience the power of music is in my classroom.  This year I want to add a new dimension to my classroom through drumming.</p>
<p><strong>Drumming is powerful.</strong>  It is one of the most <em>ancient</em> of human musical abilities.  All cultures and peoples from around the world had drums. The particular drums I want to get have an interesting story.  </p>
<p>The drums I want to buy are called cajons (ca-hones) and they were the instruments played by the slaves in South America.  Because they were made from shipping crates and could easily be hidden they were the perfect instrument, as slaves were not allowed to play music.</p>
<p>Why are they perfect for us?  They are simple, durable, and sound great!  The people that make them are a small company in Southern Manitoba - so they are ""local"".  And they handcraft them.  Awesome!</p>
<p>Drumming is empowering and gives these kids a real sense of accomplishment.  When you help us out, you will really be becoming a part of the bigger picture of life on this planet.  These children will remember drumming in my class for years to come.  They may go on to become musicians or may just have their lives enriched beyond anything they have ever known.  </p>
<p><strong>We'd really appreciate it if you'd help us make this dream come true: take some time right this second to enrich the life of a child and click ""Contribute Now"".</strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need exactly $6440 for 25 drums.  This includes shipping and tax.  I have a whopping budget of $700, so that brings it down to about $5700.  If we don't raise the entire amount I will simply buy fewer drums.  All of the money raised will go towards drums.</p>
<p>We have some wonderful perks that will give you a warm fuzzy feeling every time you think about your contribution.</p>
<p>$25 - A student will write you an email thanking you personally for helping us.  We will include a clip of the student drumming.</p>
<p>$50 - A student will write you an email thanking you personally for helping us.  We will include a clip of the student drumming.  You will receive several mp3s of different groups of students drumming.</p>

<p>$500 - You will get the thank you, the mp3s, a video of my elite drumming group playing, and we will name a drum after you.  Your name will live on in a drum!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>In my classroom, all kids are accepted, encouraged, and inspired to be the best person that they can be.  </p>
<p>By helping buy drums you are contributing to a child's sense of self, their belief in their own abilities, and their experience of life as more than just a series of events.  Through playing music they begin to see their lives as melodies interwoven with other sounds to create harmonies that echo throughout the entire world.  Really. <strong> That is how important you are in the life of a child you don't even know.</strong></p>
<p>You are helping enrich a child's education and life.  All for a few bucks you would've spent on fast food or somewhere you wouldn't even remember.</p>

<p>Hello!  Nate Lombardi here!  Thank you for visiting our campaign! There is such wonderful momentum growing after a lot of work with some incredible allies here in NYC.  Andrew Kaufman, Knute Ogren, Diane Johnson, Venus Francois, Scott Frace, Sidnei Beal, Claudia Hehr, Dayna Kline, Avatar Studios, Joe DeBonis, The Museum of Tolerance NY, Christopher Trujillio, Paige Chin, Sara Rae Fletcher, Benjamin Farias, Amanda and Adam Weber, Paul and Bonnie Lombardi and Spicky Hilton have already been generous with their support of this endeavor. We hope to partner with you as well in changing the world! </p>
<p>A tad bit about me: I come from a family of teachers. (Yep, those of you that know me also know my nerdy, hippie, camp-counseling parents. ) Both of my sisters, in-laws and parents have been teachers in their lifetimes.  “We done be real smart-like and sappy folk.“ =) Last year I received my substitute teacher's license in New York City and volunteered at a public school in Brownsville, Brooklyn.  I was incredibly moved by the students and the innate gifts they had to offer, even though they are in a “High risk” school. Not to go overboard but 1980’s Whitney Houston was right on “I believe the children are our future, teach them well and let the lead the way. Show them all the beauty that they have inside….Come on, Everybody now!”</p>
<p>I have always wanted to affect children in a major way and inspire them. I hope to empower them with this presentation and these artistic projects across the country. I believe that the most effective way to make a lasting impression on a student is for them to physically and emotionally get involved in these life lessons.  If we can get them laughing, moving and challenging themselves, it will open up their mouths &amp; chests for us to reach in and touch their brains &amp; hearts.  It’s so important to show them this positive lifestyle option as they are forming their opinions of this world.  (It’s literally the only way that worked for “Mister ADHD“ over here writing the pitch)</p>
<p><strong>The Groovy Projects</strong> is a company that empowers students and their teachers to understand how lifting up their peers feels worlds better than breaking them down. Also educating them on how to deal with bullying in order to make it stop. There are many “Groovy Projects” to go about reaching them, including interactive student presentations (and training), art/song contests, DVDs, CD games, short movies, and music videos.  I will enlist some of New York City’s most talented visionaries, on our mission to mold thousands… millions… BILLIONS of children’s perspectives on how to live a positive, encouraging and fulfilling life. We will get these kids excited and involved about creating inspiring art while doing good! <br/><br/> This year I had the privilege to work with the children of Madison-Oneida BOCES, It was quite easy for me to relate to them and their attention spans. (I think I’ve taken 12 snack breaks as I’ve written this.)  This school gets a bad rap and is the “last chance” for some of them. But let me tell you- they are great kids.  The incomparable Emmy and Tony award winning producer, Jennifer Maloney-Prezioso, conceived/directed/produced shot an anti-bullying school music video with Five Time Emmy Winner Joe DeBonis to one of my songs called THE GROOVY PROJECT, which landed us a segment on ABC's 20/20 with Chris Cuomo that discusses the mindsets and rehabilitation of bullies! Here’s the interviews and music video. Please watch!  <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/groovy-project-music-video-inspires-bullies-change-18432235"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/groovy-project-music-video-inspires-bullies-change-18432235</a> <br/><br/> ""The Groovy Project"" received a lot of coverage, and over three-dozen celebrities re-tweeted the music video with enthusiastic remarks. We're so proud of what we’ve accomplished thus far!   Madison-Oneida BOCES has since changed its curriculum and the kids were greatly affected. The music video also led me to hosting and performing in the “Bullied Bus Monitor” Karen Klein’s “No Bully Tour” this October for National Bullying Awareness Month. And now I can’t stop!  There's much more to do!<br/><br/> This has been the perfect platform for me to align with my life goals. A bunch of leads and possibilities arose because people came out of the woodwork to help further this important cause of empowering our youth. Now, with my friends, I'm dedicated to spreading his message to schools and creating content!

<p><br/> With your tax-deductible donation to our account via indiegogo/Fractured Atlas, we can make this mission a REALITY. Please also share this with all of your family, friends, and companies that might rally behind us!</p>
<p>Here are the projects we have planned with your help:</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The School presentation agenda: </span></p>
<p>-To Perform at the Museum of Tolerance for pro-bono for a group of students.</p>
<p>-To book Schools and offer them the return “Groovy Projects” (for free, if paid for with donations,) and for fees if they have the money.  </p>
<p>-Two Pubic Schools in the Bronx pro-bono that we've committed to.</p>
<p>-To approach schools ASAP is important because there are Anti-Bullying Laws that go into effect in July so school will be looking for programs before then.</p>
<p>               *<strong><em>One</em></strong> insurance company covers all the charter schools in NYC. I need to go after them ASAP before they find some else.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Project #1 </span></p>
<p>Create positive music in a professional setting that we can give to schools.  The goal is to have an instrumental version for the students to write their own verses and choruses. We will then have a contest for the students and offer them some cool incentives like recording at NYC top recording studio, Avatar!</p>
<p>We’ll ask industry veteran Deejays/producers to donate beats, or give a discounted rate with a small percentage of the purchased material. This will legitimize us in the industry with the hopes of reaching even more celebrated and current hit makers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Project #2</span></p>
<p>Create a DVD where we illustrate anti-bullying techniques, What to do or say when a bully does certain things to you.  Gay? Fat? Ugly? Short? Terrorist? Etc.  It will contain interviews with successful people that have been bullied. Us playing Izzy Kalman’s “The idiot game.“ </p>
<p>Teach basic and fun skills including: Beatbox, Ballroom, Swing, Salsa, Body percussion, Freestyle rhyme vs poems, Tap dance, Hip-hop, Ballet and Exercise, Piano, Music production, Music Theory, Guitar.</p>
<p>#<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2a</span> Flash Drives would be offered instead of, or in addition to the CD and DVD it would contain the “CD,” The Groovy Project video,  “DVD” lessons, the Speech.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Project #3</span></p>
<p>An art and photography contest where we highlight how “Cool” it is to be an individual, no matter what is said by bullies and “haters.”</p>

<p>As you would rightfully assume, there are some initial start up costs that are needed to establish and then maintain the company.  Donations will go to materials, recording, photography and video equipment, legal costs, “The Groovy Projects” logo, website costs, business cards, merchandise and administrative costs. </p>
<p>For the “Projects” we have friends that are very successful in the industry with great equipment that we’ve used, but it was borrowed; and we cannot continue to borrow equipment for every project if we plan to do this on a regular basis. (For example we edited “The Groovy Project” video at The David Letterman’s Show editing suite.) </p>
<p>To have the right equipment would be most cost effective in a well-oiled machine, which can create these projects “in house.”   If, at the beginning, we outsource services and equipment, will get the best possible price because of our resources and relationships.  So you should expect all of “The Projects” to look and sound like they cost a fortune.  If they do run over budget, which is unlikely, it will be for the right reasons, because every dollar will be spent wisely and approved by the non-for-profit Fractured Atlas.</p>
<p>Here is the of planned projects and their estimated costs <em>from start to finish</em>:</p>
<p><strong>School Assembly</strong></p>
<p>To send a speaker to a school to speak- $500-1500 a day.  Up to 3 schools. Plus Travel.  This fee is on the low to medium side for assembly speakers. We will first look to the schools’ budgets before The Groovy Projects’ budget.</p>

Hello!  Nate Lombardi here!  Thank you for visiting our campaign! There is such wonderful momentum growing after a lot of work with some incredible allies here in NYC.  Andrew Kaufman, Knute Ogren, Diane Johnson, Venus Francois, Scott Frace, Sidnei Beal, Claudia Hehr, Dayna Kline, Avatar Studios, Joe DeBonis, The Museum of Tolerance NY, Christopher Trujillio, Paige Chin, Sara Rae Fletcher, Benjamin Farias, Amanda and Adam Weber, Paul and Bonnie Lombardi and Spicky Hilton have already been generous with their support of this endeavor. We hope to partner with you as well in changing the world! 
A tad bit about me: I come from a family of teachers. (Yep, those of you that know me also know my nerdy, hippie, camp-counseling parents. ) Both of my sisters, in-laws and parents have been teachers in their lifetimes.  “We done be real smart-like and sappy folk.“ =) Last year I received my substitute teacher's license in New York City and volunteered at a public school in Brownsville, Brooklyn.  I was incredibly moved by the students and the innate gifts they had to offer, even though they are in a “High risk” school. Not to go overboard but 1980’s Whitney Houston was right on “I believe the children are our future, teach them well and let the lead the way. Show them all the beauty that they have inside….Come on, Everybody now!”
I have always wanted to affect children in a major way and inspire them. I hope to empower them with this presentation and these artistic projects across the country. I believe that the most effective way to make a lasting impression on a student is for them to physically and emotionally get involved in these life lessons.  If we can get them laughing, moving and challenging themselves, it will open up their mouths & chests for us to reach in and touch their brains & hearts.  It’s so important to show them this positive lifestyle option as they are forming their opinions of this world.  (It’s literally the only way that worked for “Mister ADHD“ over here writing the pitch)
The Groovy Projects is a company that empowers students and their teachers to understand how lifting up their peers feels worlds better than breaking them down. Also educating them on how to deal with bullying in order to make it stop. There are many “Groovy Projects” to go about reaching them, including interactive student presentations (and training), art/song contests, DVDs, CD games, short movies, and music videos.  I will enlist some of New York City’s most talented visionaries, on our mission to mold thousands… millions… BILLIONS of children’s perspectives on how to live a positive, encouraging and fulfilling life. We will get these kids excited and involved about creating inspiring art while doing good!  This year I had the privilege to work with the children of Madison-Oneida BOCES, It was quite easy for me to relate to them and their attention spans. (I think I’ve taken 12 snack breaks as I’ve written this.)  This school gets a bad rap and is the “last chance” for some of them. But let me tell you- they are great kids.  The incomparable Emmy and Tony award winning producer, Jennifer Maloney-Prezioso, conceived/directed/produced shot an anti-bullying school music video with Five Time Emmy Winner Joe DeBonis to one of my songs called THE GROOVY PROJECT, which landed us a segment on ABC's 20/20 with Chris Cuomo that discusses the mindsets and rehabilitation of bullies! Here’s the interviews and music video. Please watch!  http://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/groovy-project-music-video-inspires-bullies-change-18432235  ""The Groovy Project"" received a lot of coverage, and over three-dozen celebrities re-tweeted the music video with enthusiastic remarks. We're so proud of what we’ve accomplished thus far!   Madison-Oneida BOCES has since changed its curriculum and the kids were greatly affected. The music video also led me to hosting and performing in the “Bullied Bus Monitor” Karen Klein’s “No Bully Tour” this October for National Bullying Awareness Month. And now I can’t stop!  There's much more to do! This has been the perfect platform for me to align with my life goals. A bunch of leads and possibilities arose because people came out of the woodwork to help further this important cause of empowering our youth. Now, with my friends, I'm dedicated to spreading his message to schools and creating content! Click on this appendage of NateKid.com to see The School Presentation and a sampling of the content that will be on TheGroovyProjects.com (which is being built now!) THE GROOVY PROJECTS
 With your tax-deductible donation to our account via indiegogo/Fractured Atlas, we can make this mission a REALITY. Please also share this with all of your family, friends, and companies that might rally behind us!
Here are the projects we have planned with your help:
The School presentation agenda: 
-To Perform at the Museum of Tolerance for pro-bono for a group of students.
-To book Schools and offer them the return “Groovy Projects” (for free, if paid for with donations,) and for fees if they have the money.  
-Two Pubic Schools in the Bronx pro-bono that we've committed to.
-To approach schools ASAP is important because there are Anti-Bullying Laws that go into effect in July so school will be looking for programs before then.
               *One insurance company covers all the charter schools in NYC. I need to go after them ASAP before they find some else.
 
Project #1 
Create positive music in a professional setting that we can give to schools.  The goal is to have an instrumental version for the students to write their own verses and choruses. We will then have a contest for the students and offer them some cool incentives like recording at NYC top recording studio, Avatar!
We’ll ask industry veteran Deejays/producers to donate beats, or give a discounted rate with a small percentage of the purchased material. This will legitimize us in the industry with the hopes of reaching even more celebrated and current hit makers.
 
Project #2
Create a DVD where we illustrate anti-bullying techniques, What to do or say when a bully does certain things to you.  Gay? Fat? Ugly? Short? Terrorist? Etc.  It will contain interviews with successful people that have been bullied. Us playing Izzy Kalman’s “The idiot game.“ 
Teach basic and fun skills including: Beatbox, Ballroom, Swing, Salsa, Body percussion, Freestyle rhyme vs poems, Tap dance, Hip-hop, Ballet and Exercise, Piano, Music production, Music Theory, Guitar.
#2a Flash Drives would be offered instead of, or in addition to the CD and DVD it would contain the “CD,” The Groovy Project video,  “DVD” lessons, the Speech.
 
Project #3
An art and photography contest where we highlight how “Cool” it is to be an individual, no matter what is said by bullies and “haters.”
 
Product #4 
To work with educators in order to create an empowering curriculum for younger students.  To interview and student the Olweus Program, meet with Dr. Joel Haber, and Josh Shipp.
 
Project #5
T-Shirts, Stickers, Binders, Book Covers etc

<h2>What is CouchPotato</h2>
For people who read this and go ""Da fuck is this!?"".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>CouchPotato is an automatic NZB and torrent downloader, just fill in what you want to see and CouchPotato will add it to your ""want to watch""-list. Every day it will search through multiple NZBs &amp; Torrents sites, looking for the best possible match. <br/>Once a correct release is found, it will send it to your favorite download app.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h2>Why do you need a server that costs money!?</h2>
The server gets hit with around 40 requests per second. It is used for movie info, searches, movie ETA and checking if an imdb url is a movie (and not a show). Next to that the forum and other stuff CouchPotato related.</div>
<div>All this needs speed. You don't want to wait 10s before a search is returns results, instant is what we want! The current server can keep up in the slow hours, but on sunday evening (the busiest hours) it sometimes takes more than 20s to return something..</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h2>What will this money get me?</h2>
The 1500 bucks will pay for the server costs for 1 year. I currently use FutureHosting as a provider, but I don't know if I'll stay with them. This will not pay for the full package, but I will pay the rest myself. Even if the goal isn't reached, the costs will be there and I will be paying for it myself ;)</div>
<div>I never done anything like this and have no idea if this will work out.</div>
<div> </div>

<h2>Update: already made it to 1500 dollars! What now?</h2>
<div>I'm working on a new, easier and more plugable API server, written in NodeJS. Now I can't promise anything, but I'm writing this with the idea in mind that I can run from multiple sources. So eventually, when the time is ready, I might opensource it so a few people that want to, can run their own.</div>
<div>The extra money will go to testing some of this stuff out, getting a small seperate NodeJS server. The rest will just be used for next year!</div>

<h2><strong>Why can't I use Paypal?</strong></h2>
<p>Paypal is playing internet police. They blocked my account a few months ago, letting me wait to get my money out (luckily it wasn't much). So I don't have Paypal and will never again will be able to use Paypal unless I change my name. I tried making a new account, but it got blocked a few minutes after it was created.<br/>I understand that some of you don't have a creditcard, but I can't 'un-asshole' Paypal ;)</p></div>","No Paypal, why?

What is CouchPotato
For people who read this and go ""Da fuck is this!?"".
 
CouchPotato is an automatic NZB and torrent downloader, just fill in what you want to see and CouchPotato will add it to your ""want to watch""-list. Every day it will search through multiple NZBs & Torrents sites, looking for the best possible match. Once a correct release is found, it will send it to your favorite download app.
 

Why do you need a server that costs money!?
The server gets hit with around 40 requests per second. It is used for movie info, searches, movie ETA and checking if an imdb url is a movie (and not a show). Next to that the forum and other stuff CouchPotato related.
All this needs speed. You don't want to wait 10s before a search is returns results, instant is what we want! The current server can keep up in the slow hours, but on sunday evening (the busiest hours) it sometimes takes more than 20s to return something..
 

What will this money get me?
The 1500 bucks will pay for the server costs for 1 year. I currently use FutureHosting as a provider, but I don't know if I'll stay with them. This will not pay for the full package, but I will pay the rest myself. Even if the goal isn't reached, the costs will be there and I will be paying for it myself ;)
I never done anything like this and have no idea if this will work out.

<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Dawn and I am actor and lover of theatre and Shakespeare. I began specialising in Shakespeare at the age of 20 when I was accepted into the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in 2007 in an intensive Shakespeare course.</p>
<p>Combing a love of acting and travelling I headed to New Zealand in 2009 where I was accepted into the South Seas Film &amp; Television School to develop my skills in On-Screen Acting. After graduating I got and agent and have been working in New Zealand as a professional actor ever since.</p>
I have worked in numerous theatre productions and recently worked on a NZ television drama. I have my own acting studio in Central Auckland, ‘Studio the Stage’, and it is here where I train and teach acting and Shakespeare.
<p>I have been accepted into the Shakespeare Institute to study a Masters Degree in Shakespeare &amp; Theatre Studies. I will be studying this course via Distance Learning between 24-36 months.</p>
<p>The Shakespeare Institute programme focuses on how Shakespeare's plays work in performance. It encourages a historical approach to interpretation and styles of presentation and it promotes the value of close reading as the basis for evaluating the plays on the page, stage, and screen. I will have the opportunity to look at different productions and adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays in their historical, political, and cultural contexts and think about the performance choices actors and directors make when approaching Shakespeare’s texts.</p>
<p>I have many creative visions about what exactly I want to achieve after completion of my Masters and then PhD in Shakespeare and Theatres Studies. Mostly, like any Shakespeare lover, I want to come up with new ways of telling the stories that can be accessible through all cultures, countries and ultimately languages.</p>
<p>Ultimately you will be giving me the chance to share my knowledge of Shakespeare around the globe. By helping in this campaign you will be giving me peace of mind of not having to worry about whether I can afford the next module or not. You will be giving me the freedom to concentrate 100% on my studies which will allow me to really excel and achieve the very most out of this important time of study.</p>
<h2><strong>Breakdown of Costs</strong></h2>
<p>This Postgraduate Masters Degree in Shakespeare Studies is £5,490 in total.</p>
<p>Fees for part-time and distance learning modes are £610 per module and £1,830 for the dissertation:</p>
<p>6 modules x £610 = £3,660</p>
<p>1 x dissertation = £1,830</p>
<p>Total course fee is £5,490 ($8,385 USD)</p>
<p>If this campaign is successful any additional money I raise will be put towards my studies, more specifically, suggested textbooks and reading material and research towards my PhD.</p>
<p>If I don’t reach my intended goal, any money I raise will still go towards this campaign. I have accepted my place at the Shakespeare Institute and am able to pay the course fee in instalments.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>I feel I will influence and guide many people from an actors’ point of view as well as a practitioner’s point of view and I would relish the opportunity to encourage and strengthen peoples’ perceptions of Shakespeare and his work in an influential and constructive way. Ultimately I want people to have the same approach to and adoration of Shakespeare as I do which in turn will continue his work around the globe in a myriad of new forms.</p>
<p>The very thought of starting my Masters to PhD in Shakespeare and Theatre Studies not only excites me, it grounds me. I'm here because it is something I am dedicated to learn about and eventually teach. All I ask from you is that you take a chance on me.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>Please spread the word about my campaign. If you are not able to help but know of others who may then please share this with them especially those who are interested in the arts, Shakespeare or making someone’s dream come true.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.four-h.purdue.edu/omk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Operation Military Kids</a> has sent kids to a one week camp for the last 2 years. Unfortunately, their funding was cut this year due to sequestration.  </p>

<p>In 2011, over <strong>103,000 youth</strong> participated in experiences conducted by State OMK Teams in 49 states and the District of Columbia.  </p>

</div></div>","The children of our military service personnel need your help to attend a one week summer camp with their peers.
Operation Military Kids has sent kids to a one week camp for the last 2 years. Unfortunately, their funding was cut this year due to sequestration.  
Through OMK, Military Youth:

Meet other youth who are also experiencing deployment
Participate in a range of recreational, social & educational programs
Gain leadership, organizational, and technical skills by participating in the Speak Out for Military Kids program or Mobile Technology Lab programs
Attend single day, weekend or even longer residential camps
Operation: Military Kids is the U.S. Army's collaborative effort with America's communities to support children and youth impacted by deployment. Regardless of whether Families are experiencing deployment for the first time, the second time or another in a series of multiple deployments, OMK’s goal is to connect military children and youth with local resources in order to achieve a sense of community support and enhance their well-being.
In 2011, over 103,000 youth participated in experiences conducted by State OMK Teams in 49 states and the District of Columbia.  
This year we need your help to send these kids to camp.  Any amount will help us reach our goal.  Last year we were able to get 48 kids from Indiana, Michigan and Illinois to camp.  Help if you can, these kids deserve our support!
For your donation you will receive:
$5 donation- Some peace in knowing you have helped                      
$10 donation- One camper personalized thank you note                     
$50 donation- Five campers personalized thank you note

<h3>Our Story</h3>We are a small collective of radicals and political activists putting on a three day event in central Oxford on the first weekend of March, 2nd-4th. We have a huge number of high profile speakers and groups already confirmed including Terry Eagleton, author of Why Marx was Right, groups like The No Tar Sands Campaign, Traveller Solidarity Network, plus a whole host more.  

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the last year, as the global economic crisis has
deepened, we have seen revolutions sweep dictators from power across the Middle
East and North Africa and resistance to austerity spread across Europe and the
US with the Occupy Movement. There have been a number of general strikes in Greece and mass
strikes in Britain.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This year's Oxford Radical Forum (ORF) will be held from
2-4th March. This will be the fifth anniversary of the forum, run by students,
lecturers and local activists based in the city. This year it is bigger than
ever, with almost thirty sessions over a host of colleges and venues during the
weekend. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The forum opens with â€˜the MENA Revolutions: One Year Onâ€™,
with Nadine El-Enany (activist from Cairo), Gilbert Achcar (SOAS), Anne
Alexander (Cambridge) and Firoze Manji (Pambazuka Press). This will be followed
by a discussion between Terry Eagleton and Alex Callinicos on â€˜Why Marx was
Rightâ€™.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Over the weekend, we will bring together Occupy activists
from New York via live link-up with activists from Occupy London, for
reflections on how the movement has changed politics and on how it can develop.
International perspectives will also be brought by sessions on political
struggle from Latin America to the Eurozone to China. A meeting on sexual
liberation will be joined by Ghassan Makaram, a Lebanese LGBTQ activist. On
Saturday, Greg Philo will join Moshe Machover and Daphna Baram for a meeting on
Palestine and the Media.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This yearâ€™s line-up also reflects rising levels of
resistance to austerity in Britain. We will bring together trade unionists from
public and private sectors, students and community activists. Our session on
the future of education will discuss governmentâ€™s decision to withdraw its
Higher Education Bill with John Holmwood (Campaign for the Public University)
and others. We will also have important sessions on â€˜Defending the Right to Protestâ€™,
â€˜Race, Racism and Resistanceâ€™, and even â€˜Radical Scienceâ€™.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As always the event is entirely FREE, but we welcome and encourage
donations towards the costs of putting on the Forum.<br/><br/>
We hope you will join us at the event. Spread the word!</p>

Participants learn to make age appropriate meals, snacks and treats; and we always incorporate a healthy serving of scholastic information.

Chef Chloe mixing up a good time!
How does this fundraiser work?
We are the new owners of Kids Culinary Adventures started in 2002 by an amazing woman and incredible chef. We are taking over and need your help to purchase new equipment and be able to rent a temporary kitchen space while we continue to grow. With your help we will be able to purchase new equipment such as; Kitchen Aid mixers, sheet pans for baking, aprons for our students to wear while cooking, and in general the financial help we need to keep Kids Culinary Adventures up and running as a place we can share our passion for the culinary arts with many more children in a safe and educational setting. We thank you for helping us continue to carry on what is already great and make it as succesful as its ever been.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The Global Leadership Forum is a program through United World College. It is a two week program running from August 1-14th in New Mexico. It teaches Leadership Skills to those entering their Sophomore and Junior years of High School. I would leave with a plan that I would have developed there for a community service project. This program is very important to me, because I really care about making a positive difference in the world, and this program would give me the skils that I need to be a leader of change. And, I would get to meet incredible people from all around the world!</p>
<p>I decided to apply to the program quite late in the game and so there wasn't a lot of funding available, but fortunately I almost have enough money to go. I only need 700 more dollars!</p>
<p>I know that everyone is really stretched right now because of the economy, but if you could just pitch in even a small amount, I would appreciate it so much. A little bit from a lot of people really goes a long way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's what I need:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>- I need to raise 700 dollars by this coming Tuesday, July 24th.</p>
<p>- This is only going to be possible if as many people as possible chip in</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That's all there is to it! If you can't contribute, that's fine, no worries! But if you can that's great, and thank you so much!</p>

<h3>Modern Widows Club Magazine is the first ever magazine advocating for widow causes. Women living, growing &amp; reaching back as widow mentors &amp; advocates of the world. Our time, our voice. </h3>
<h3><strong>Short Summary: </strong></h3>
<p>Be kind to ONE widow today: That's our mission is to guide, develop and promote extraordinary widow mentors and advocates globally to create one powerful voice for all. </p>
<p>Our goal is to move forward with our MWC following on Facebook/Twitter and bring together widow experts into one viral platform, the MWC magazine. Your contributions will assist us in finding the 11.4 million widows in the US and start by creating 20 formal MWC chapters in the US by the end of 2013 and grow from there. </p>
<p>History: We began in January 2012 with 3 women in Orlando and now have 4 national chapters in Orlando, Kansas City, Denver &amp; Seattle. </p>
<p>Until we receive our 501(c)3 non-profit status (in process), the magazine will give us the ability to bring current information immediately to those who need it renew their life after life altering circumstances. How? By inspiring them with those who have walked before them. We will cover wellbeing/ health, legal/ financial, spirit/ faith, living spaces, family, world wide widows, interviews (celebrities, thought leaders, professors, authors, speakers), stories, opinions (dating widows, bitter widows, widow comedians, daughters w/o fathers, widowers) and reviews (books, movies, art, music). </p>
<p>Our contributors have modern, relevant, purposeful, fresh, edgy and contemplative viewpoints which share the widow experience with connected, open conversations to modernize the perception of the widow journey. A positive from a negative. This is a launching pad to something truly extraordinary for our lives. Widows have so much to give society and yet they feel completely isolated many times. It doesn't have to be this way. </p>
<h3><strong><em>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</em></strong></h3>
<p><em>Magazine Cost Breakdown:</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Magazine:</em> Main Goal- </strong>Graphic design/ logo &amp; homepage design, wireframe, build out, organization of all internal pages fully functional/sharable, development notes, development management, develop, testing time, launch review.</p>
<p>Salary alottment: Hire a part time online manager to compile information, train contributors to plug in to magazine for downloads and input articles/photos etc . This also includes integrated software plug ins to manage information and tag properly. </p>
<p>Also, we are utilizing this budget to fund the non-profit processing fees. We began 6 months ago and it will be a full 8 months to complete from start to finish. Nuts &amp; bolts: $11,000 (negotiated web designers reduced cost)</p>
<p><strong><em>Chapter Leader Training/ Salary: Sedondary Goal- </em></strong>If we are fortunate to raise this: Material/bylaw binders, printing, shipping, travel costs to chapter cities, speaking events &amp; time marketing. We will use Skype at first, then as the chapter grows, travel there inexpensively being hosted by leaders. 20 Chapters in 2013 $8000</p>
<p><strong><em>Contributor/ Expert Training:</em></strong> Printing, shipping, go to meeting fees $300</p>
<p><strong><em>Overhead costs:</em></strong> Domain annual fee, Trademark protection, GotoMeeting fees, business license, office supplies. $860</p>
<p><strong><em>Celebration Party</em></strong> at Magazine Launch. Gifts for widows in attendance. We are giving away one HOME MAKEOVER to a widow and sending more MISSION LEGOS to Nairobi widows: $1300</p>
<p><em><strong>Perks</strong></em> to purchase for fulfillment $540</p>
<h3><strong>Impact: </strong></h3>
<p>One by one, widows lives will improve and they will reenter into a life that is greater than they anticipated because they've seen others do it before them. Their children are watching and their lives will become fulfilled with time. </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Be kind to one widow today</strong>. Bring a smile to her face and make your time with her matter like she's the only person in the world. Listen, hold a hand, drop off meals, pray daily, do something even when it feels odd or uncertain. Handymen ask to repair something. Hire her, she may need a job. Teach her a new skill. Share MWC. Mentor her children and give her a day off.<strong> Please, make some noise about us, widows already feel like no one hears them or sees them.</strong> We want to be that squeaky wheel of empowerment for widows. </p>
<p><em>Thank you so much for caring and choosing to grace us with your contribution. The widows of the world are very grateful and <strong>rarely ask for themselves.</strong> We hope every one will feel their voice is heard and valued. We all want a hand up, not a hand out.

<h2 class=""SUBHEAD"">Who we are...</h2>
<p class=""SUBHEAD"">Children’s Montessori Cooperative started as a grassroots effort in September 2012, sharing space with a Montessori Toddler Program.  CMC was created to meet a community need for a pre-school and kindergarten alternative that teaches the whole child, not just a standards-based curriculum. </p>
<p class=""SUBHEAD"">As a founding teacher of CMC, I firmly believe the Montessori philosophy enriches children’s lives by facilitating a life-long love for learning; encouraging cooperation amongst peers; providing opportunities to build critical thinking skills; and recognizing the planes of development in each child to establish an early preparedness for reading and mathematics. Lessons of grace and courtesy run deep throughout our program, we take time to learn from conflict, communicate our wants and needs, and establish a plan that is valued as fair and just for those involved. </p>
<p class=""SUBHEAD""> </p>
<h2 class=""SUBHEAD"">What your contribution will do...</h2>
<p class=""SUBHEAD"">This campaign will allow CMC to move from its grassroots pilot program, a successful first year, to a full-time Montessori program that provides opportunities for more students in an environment equipped with curriculum-based materials. </p>
<p class=""SUBHEAD"">Three-fourths of the campaign goal will be spent on Montessori materials that will meet the needs of our pre-school and kindergarten curriculum.  The other quarter of the goal will be used as a deposit and first month's rent in a new space that will meet the licensing requirements to move our program forward.  Fifty percent of money raised that exceeds our goal will be used toward a scholarship fund to reduce the cost of tuition for families in need, with the remainder being used for upgrading our furniture and the added costs of licensing (lighted EXIT signs and extra outlet covers). </p>
<p class=""SUBHEAD""> </p>
<h2>What you get...</h2>
<p>Your contribution helps to fund a program founded on an educational method that has been successful for over one hundred years.  The Montessori Method has enriched the lives of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, founders of Google; Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com; Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, former first lady (John F. Kennedy); Sean ‘P.Diddy’ Combs, singer; Prince William and Prince Harry; Julia Child, author, chef, TV cooking shows; Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Nobel Prize winner for Literature; Katherine Graham, ex-owner of the Washington Post; and Anne Frank - author, diarist from World War II. Your contribution would put you in the ranks of famous Montessori supporters such as Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Yo Yo Ma, and Helen Keller.</p>
<p>If you still need a little nudge to get you into the list of the great supporters, check out our cool perks!</p>
<h3>If now is not a good time for you...</h3>
<p>Trust me, I understand, you want to support CMC but money is tight! There are still ways you can help.</p>
<ul>
<li>PLEASE SHARE OUR CAMPAIGN! Networking and spreading our message around will bring in friends and family who may be able to financially back our campaign.</li>
<li>LEAVE WORDS OF PRAISE! If you are/were a Montessori student or you know someone who is/was, give us some written support and spread the knowledge. </li>
</ul><h2>Thank you for your time...</h2>
<p>Thank you for looking, for reading, for sharing, and supporting our campaign.  Every child deserves to be looked at individually and given an opportunity to learn at their own pace. They deserve to explore and blossom freely, within safe and respectful boundaries.  Your support of this campaign allows me to share an exceptional method of education with beautiful young minds.</p>

What your contribution will do...
This campaign will allow CMC to move from its grassroots pilot program, a successful first year, to a full-time Montessori program that provides opportunities for more students in an environment equipped with curriculum-based materials. 
Three-fourths of the campaign goal will be spent on Montessori materials that will meet the needs of our pre-school and kindergarten curriculum.  The other quarter of the goal will be used as a deposit and first month's rent in a new space that will meet the licensing requirements to move our program forward.  Fifty percent of money raised that exceeds our goal will be used toward a scholarship fund to reduce the cost of tuition for families in need, with the remainder being used for upgrading our furniture and the added costs of licensing (lighted EXIT signs and extra outlet covers). 
 
What you get...
Your contribution helps to fund a program founded on an educational method that has been successful for over one hundred years.  The Montessori Method has enriched the lives of Larry Page and Sergey Brin, founders of Google; Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com; Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, former first lady (John F. Kennedy); Sean ‘P.Diddy’ Combs, singer; Prince William and Prince Harry; Julia Child, author, chef, TV cooking shows; Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Nobel Prize winner for Literature; Katherine Graham, ex-owner of the Washington Post; and Anne Frank - author, diarist from World War II. Your contribution would put you in the ranks of famous Montessori supporters such as Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Yo Yo Ma, and Helen Keller.
If you still need a little nudge to get you into the list of the great supporters, check out our cool perks!
If now is not a good time for you...
Trust me, I understand, you want to support CMC but money is tight! There are still ways you can help.

PLEASE SHARE OUR CAMPAIGN! Networking and spreading our message around will bring in friends and family who may be able to financially back our campaign.
LEAVE WORDS OF PRAISE! If you are/were a Montessori student or you know someone who is/was, give us some written support and spread the knowledge. 
Thank you for your time...
Thank you for looking, for reading, for sharing, and supporting our campaign.  Every child deserves to be looked at individually and given an opportunity to learn at their own pace. They deserve to explore and blossom freely, within safe and respectful boundaries.  Your support of this campaign allows me to share an exceptional method of education with beautiful young minds.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong><em>UPDATE:</em> Funds for this orphanage are much lot more urgently needed than first anticipated. Reuben has informed me that without funding, the building of this orphanage will not go ahead. What started out as a campaign to feed the orphans in Nepal is now a desperate plea to first give them a home. Please give generously to ensure the orphanage I'm going to can actually exist!</strong></h2>
<h3>Operation: Orphanage</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Dani, and I live in sunny Queensland, Australia.</p>
<p>I went to Nepal in 2008 for 5 weeks, and I'm going back in 2013 for 5 months! I'll be helping out at a brand new orphanage in Urlabari with a local Nepali missionary.</p>
<p>Orphanages are so important in a developing country like Nepal - being able to look after vulnerable children is will be a real honour.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise $5000 to help out this orphanage.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The orphanage will be brand new so it will have immediate needs. The $5000 will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clothe around 60 orphans and street children with winter clothes</li>
<li>Pay to lease a plot of land to farm food for the kids sustainably for 4-5 years</li>
<li>Feed the kids until the plot of land hits harvest time</li>
</ul>
<p>The Australian and US dollar go incredibly far in Nepal! Just $10 can feed a child in the orphanage for a whole week, which is amazing! </p>
<p>Check out the unique perks - everything from photos to Nepali swords! Get excited! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feeding and clothing these children will make a massive difference in Nepal. This seemingly simple act can help them reach their potential and empower them make a difference in their own communities.</p>
<p>Show these kids that they are not forgotten and that we really care about them!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>The free
 sharing of knowledge has gone on throughout human history, from 
generation to generation. Only recently in our history has the aspect of
 monetization been applied to the process of education and each subsequent generation is not as privileged or educated as the
 previous one. This is a trend which is damaging to each community, 
nation, and to humanity as a whole. We want to begin a new trend - to help
 others all around the world empower themselves and in turn, empower others in their communities.<br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>We are building a site with an aggregate 
listing of educational disciplines. Students will be able to create a 
profile on our site and choose what they wish to learn about. Some of 
our available links in the process of becoming available are Physics, 
Urban Planning, Women's Studies, Mathematics, Aerodynamics, Social 
Sciences, Engineering, History, Health, Business Management, and The 
Arts. Besides just listing these courses, the community will be able to 
share ideas and discuss individual course merit, have a Q&amp;A section,
 and write papers on the subject they are learning about with 
constructive interaction from the community either as a whole or just to
 those within their learning group.</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our aim is to allow others to open doors for 
themselves, to empower 
themselves to help themselves. This project is happening, but we need 
support for the licensing of software, paying software engineers, and 
initiating our first wave or promotions. We have many goals and all of 
us support our 
families, our artistic vision, and want to help others but have limited 
means to do so. Every contribution here supports this goal at a faster 
rate than we are currently able.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here's the skinny. We've 
got a small team lined up and ready to go - however we need your support
 to help fund the initial rounds of development that will be required to
 get this resource off the ground. Every cent we have goes into
 this, but at the end of the day, it isn't enough to get our idea out to
 the people for whom it will impact.  Additionally, any extra funds will
 
go towards our corporate sponsorship on the OpenCourseWare Consortium 
website.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't contribute right now? We understand. We would like to ask that
 you take some time to see if you can contribute anything on your next 
payday. Even $5 will help! And if monetary donation is not remotely 
possible for you right now, what you can do is pass on our link to this 
campaign to your friends and family. We understand that each person has 
their own unique set of circumstances and capabilities. Please, spread 
the word!  Get others involved and aware of what we have going on here. 
Share our link through all your social outlets and ask everyone to share
 as well. Our goal is to help others help themselves and this includes 
you!</p>

<p>There are literally thousands of people trapped in Biblically based cults just in American alone.  These organizations will brainwash, threaten, and even traffic humans for their own needs.  Many are polygamous and take child brides.  These children are then trapped within the organization, forced to have children in one cult in order to ""populate the planet with God's spirit babies"".  These people are NOT stupid though.  Please don't confuse stupidity with being lost, confused, born into the cult, or just looking for something to fulfill a need they have.</p>
<p>My name is Sandi and I have been studying cults for over 14 years.  I almost joined a cult and thankfully God opened my eyes.  I have dedicated my life to work with people that are trapped like I almost was and want to see them free, thinking for themselves and making their own decisions. </p>
<p>My funding this trip you will allow me the opportunity to work with people who are in a cult that is disguising itself as a Christian denomination.  There are over 38,000 people in just one offshoot and there are thousands of offshoots.  The number of people affected by this cult is astounding.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>Here's the lowdown.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will be staying with friends, so thankfully there will be no hotel fees, however, my plane fare was $777.88 (including rental car).  I will also be contributing to food, buying gas for the rental car and since I am taking time off of work, I need to supplement that time off. </p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I am still going to go.  I'll just eat a lot of PB &amp;J sandwiches. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Can you imagine if just one person was able to safely get out of a cult? This may sound like a rough comparison, but if one more person had gotten to leave Jonestown, or if one more person could have left Mt. Carmel during the Branch Davidians raid?  One person.  It may not sound like a lot, but that's one more person who's life was spared.  That's what I want to do.  I want to help people who are looking for a way out to find that way.  By your contributions, you can absolutely save a life.  If I can reach one person, a life can be saved; freed.  I have been working with people in cults for many years and by God's grace, have seen people leave them.  The freedom they now possess is outstanding.  One friend, after leaving her cult, got ""Freedom"" tattooed onto her arm.  It may not sound like a lot to one person, but it is everything to them.</p>

<p><b>FatCut
 UPCYCLING</b> is a collaborative network with horizontal structure that 
experiments, creates and transforms seemingly useless objects (garbage) 
in order to give them greater sustainability and re-purpose them into 
useful products and educational toys (<b>upcycling*</b>). It is also a 
laboratory workshop  of ideas and know-how freely available to everyone,
 giving solutions to everyday needs.<br/><br/>From cardboard,
 newspapers, plastic bags, pallets, soda caps to damaged water heaters and other 
“garbage”, everything is being processed in order to postpone its arrival to the dump or 
junkyard and to increase its span of life. This way, the already oversized mass 
of garbage is de-congested and the energy cost of consumption is reduced.
 Even the traditional recycling of materials today, as far as we know, 
is not CO2 efficient and involves the huge cost of blue bins which is 
intensified by the lack of state management.<br/><br/><b>FatCut
 UPCYCLING</b>
 was founded 3 years ago. During these years we have published the 1st 
issue of a comic series, we have organized many workshops to show people
 of all ages how to build ecological stoves out of used heaters, glasses
 out of beer bottles and educational toys out of plastic cups, among 
many others. We have held exhibitions touring around the Mediterranean 
Sea with an upcycled sailing boat, Mystic Blue.</p>

<br/>
<p><b><b><b>*WHAT IS UPCYCLING?<br/></b></b></b></p>
<p>It
 is the process by which discarded materials or damaged products are 
processed into new materials and products of better quality or 
ecological value. The term upcycling was first introduced by Reiner Pilz
 in an article by Thorton Kay from Salvo in 1994. The idea of upcycling 
is about reusing materials and making them useful again or giving them a
 new identity and value. Furthermore, this would help reduce the 
consumption of new raw materials in order to manufacture new products.<br/>This reduction in consumption, in turn, leads to a reduction of the 
required energy wasted for their construction (basic cause for the contamination of air, groundwater and the emission of greenhouse gases).<br/><br/><b>Downcycling</b> refers to processing materials and products into new materials of inferior quality. <br/><b>Upcycling</b>,
 on the contrary, uses the entire product, in order to either make it 
useful again or give it a new identity and value.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>ABOUT CADO PARADISO</b></p>
<b>
</b>Our next project <b>CADO PARADISO </b>(TRASHCAN PARADISE) is entirely made
 <b>DIT (do-it-together)</b> by our team.    It is based in an old factory in Athens with 240 square 
meters of space.<br/><p></p>
<p>It’s
 <b>90% UPCYCLED</b>. Flying automatic dragons, castles and trampolines made 
from tires, huge plastic bottle puzzles, PVC tube slides and trashformed
 bicycle games are, among others, the scenery that aims to trigger the 
fantasy of the visitor. A series of workshops including DIY toys, 
geography, physics, biology, political participation and others will be 
introduced to the kids while and through playing.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1197034/files/20150204133813-kids.jpg?1423085893"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>OUR PHILOSOPHY</b><br/></p>
<p>You
 don’t need to be a psychologist in order to understand how “child” and 
“play” are interconnected, like the steam-iron and its handle (if the 
handle didn’t exist, you would simply burn). Each one of us only needs 
to go back to his childhood memories (if any left) and remember how a 
small twig transformed into a fairytale dragon or a pebble into the game of stone-tossing (<i>'pentovola' in greek</i>).<br/><br/>Although
 the industrialization of the “play” and the “lamination” of toys is 
something relatively recent, the times when children had their time and 
space to create their own games, seems, at least to the civilized 
barbarian, something distant, long gone and forgotten. (I don’t have 
time, you don’t have time, let’s buy it).<br/><br/>The
 play and therefore the child are not spared from the collective fantasy
 of perpetual growth, where “space-time” for free creative happiness 
does not fit in nor is part of one’s daily busy schedule. One’s career 
starts early enough so as to ensure, more and more, the lack of 
imagination in the game and later in life. This “spacetime” fortunately,
 still survives in the so-called “underdeveloped” countries, and 
contradictory though it sounds, where the presence of “civilized” toys 
hasn’t castrated the kids’ imagination yet.<br/><br/>Influenced
 by the great Spanish educator Francisco Ferrer and his 'Modern School',
 we aim to introduce an educational space-time that will cultivate 
solidarity, respect towards diversity, participation in decision making 
and autonomy in a country that still has a medieval educational system 
based on nationalism and religion. The joy of learning cannot be scored! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT WE ASK FROM CROWDFUNDERS?</b><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1280156/files/20150309030429-cadoteam-f.jpg?1425895469"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><b>FatCut
 UPCYCLING</b> members belong to vulnerable social groups.<br/>Therefore our budget is extremely limited. We hope that you will support our effort so that we can achieve:
<p>- the completion of the construction of cado paradiso space</p>
<p>- the basic operational expenses of the space for the first months (rent, bills)</p>
<p>- maintenance expenses and equipment (paint, tools, flowers and plants, papers &amp; markers, sound system)</p>
<p>- transport expenses (buy/rental of a small van for transporting materials)</p>
<p>- the design of a website and print production of flyers &amp; posters<br/></p>
<p>- fees &amp; legal services for our cooperative (lawyer, accountant etc)<br/></p>
<p>We invite you to support our efforts, so we can reclaim the space-times of freedom and fantasy for the children!<b> </b>By supporting us you also support the need for a creative, out-of-the-box education! You are our only communication sponsors, so please spread this news as smoke-signs, to everybody interested!</p>

<p><b>H ΟΜΑΔΑ FAT CUT UPCYCLING</b><br/>Η ομάδα Fat Cut Upcycling, είναι ένα συμμετοχικό δίκτυο οριζόντιας δομής με νομική μορφή κοινωνικής συνεταιριστικής επιχείρησης (ΚΟΙΝ.Σ.ΕΠ.).<br/></p>
<p>Πειραματίζεται, δημιουργεί και μεταποιεί μέσω της άμεσης ανακύκλωσης - <b>upcycling*</b> φαινομενικά άχρηστα αντικείμενα, προκειμένου να τους προσδώσει μεγαλύτερη βιωσιμότητα και να τα μετατρέψει σε χρηστικά προϊόντα ή εκπαιδευτικά παιχνίδια. Παράλληλα η ομάδα αποτελεί ένα ανοιχτό εργαστήριο ιδεών και τεχνογνωσίας που διατίθεται ελεύθερα στον καθένα, δίνοντας λύση σε καθημερινές ανάγκες.<br/></p>
<p>Χαρτοκούτες, εφημερίδες, πλαστικές σακούλες, παλέτες, καπάκια, πόρτες και παράθυρα, μικροσκόπια εώς θερμοσίφωνες και άλλα «σκουπίδια», μετά από επεξεργασία, αναβάλλουν το ραντεβού τους με τη χωματερή και αυξάνουν το μέσο όρο ζωής τους. Κάπως έτσι, αποσυμφορίζουμε τον ήδη υπερμεγέθη όγκο σκουπιδιών και μειώνουμε το ενεργειακό κόστος της κατανάλωσης γνωρίζοντας ότι ακόμα και η παραδοσιακή ανακύκλωση (όπως την ξέρουμε σήμερα) δεν φείδεται εκπομπών διοξειδίου του άνθρακα.<br/></p>
<p>Είμαστε σε λειτουργία ήδη 3 έτη, όπου μέσα σ' αυτά έχουμε πραγματοποιήσει εργαστήρια τεχνογνωσίας (workshops) για την επανοικειοποίηση πρώτων υλών που πετιούνται. Στα εργαστήρια αυτά ασχοληθήκαμε με τη κατασκευή οικολογικών σομπών, ποτηριών, πρεσών για καύσιμο πέλετ και εκπαιδευτικών παιχνιδιών μεταξύ πολλών άλλων. Επίσης στην ίδια φιλοσοφία και λογική, έχουμε εκδόσει το πρώτο τεύχος μιας σειράς κόμικ απο σκουπίδια (Trashformers), έχουμε συμμετάσχει και πραγματοποιήσει εκθέσεις, εκδηλώσεις και περιοδείες σε Ελλάδα, Ιταλία και Γαλλία, με όχημα ενα upcycled ιστιοφόρο (Mystic Blue Eco-Sailing). <br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>*ΛΙΓΑ ΛΟΓΙΑ ΓΙΑ ΤΟ UPCYCLING</b><br/>Είναι η διαδικασία κατά την οποία, πεταμένα υλικά
 ή χαλασμένα προϊόντα μεταποιούνται σε νέα υλικά και προϊόντα καλύτερης 
ποιότητας ή οικολογικής αξίας. Η πρώτη φορά που καταγράφτηκε ο όρος 
upcycling ήταν από τον Reiner Pilz σε ένα άρθρο του Thorton Kay από το 
Salvo το 1994. Ο όρος upcycling, που σε ελεύθερη μετάφραση σημαίνει 
υπερκύκλωση, ήταν τίτλος του βιβλίου του γερμανού Gunter Pauli το 1996.<br/></p>
<p>Το Downcycling είναι η συμβατική ανακύκλωση, δηλαδή η διαδικασία μεταποίησης υλών και 
προϊόντων σε νέα υλικά κατώτερης ποιότητας, αυξάνοντας ταυτόχρονα τις εργοστασιακές εκπομπες διοξειδίου του άνθρακα (CO2) στην ατμόσφαιρα. <br/></p>
<p>Το Upcycling, αντίθετα, 
χρησιμοποιεί εξ'ολοκλήρου το προϊόν, είτε καθιστώντας το εκ νέου 
χρήσιμο, είτε προσδίδοντάς του νέα ιδιότητα και αξία, μειώνοντας το ενεργειακό κόστος και τις εκπομπές ρύπων και αυξάνοντας την εφευρετικότητα και την δημιουργικότητα του ανθρώπου.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>ΤΟ ""ΚΑΔΟ ΠΑΡΑΝΤΙΣΟ""</b><br/>Το παρόν υπέρ-εγχείρημα της Fat Cut ονομάζεται <b>""ΚΑΔΟ ΠΑΡΑΝΤΙΣΟ""</b> και μέχρι τη στιγμή αυτή κατασκευάζεται αποκλειστικά από μέλη της ομάδας μας σε μια διαδικασία <b>D.I.T (do-it-together)</b>. Πρόκειται για έναν χώρο 240τ.μ, στην οδό Εριγόνης 3, στα Κάτω Πετράλωνα της Αθήνας, που φιλοδοξεί να φιλοξενήσει παιδιά όλων των ηλικιών, προκειμένου να παίξουν, να απασχοληθούν δημιουργικά και να εκπαιδευτούν σε τεχνικές κατασκευής upcycled παιχνιδιών και χρηστικών αντικειμένων.<br/><br/>Ο παιχνιδοχώρος <b>""ΚΑΔΟ ΠΑΡΑΝΤΙΣΟ""</b> κατασκευάζεται κατα 90% απο φύρα. Ιπτάμενοι δράκοι, τεράστια πάζλ από πλαστικά μπουκάλια, μεταποιημένα παιχνίδια με ποδήλατα, μουσικά παιχνίδια και τσουλήθρες απο σωλήνες pvc, κάστρα και τραμπολίνο απο ρόδες αυτοκινήτων και πολλά άλλα θα συνθέσουν μια φαντασμαγορία για τις 5 αισθήσεις παιδιών και μεγάλων.</p>
<p>Στον χώρο θα λάβουν μέρος μια σειρά εργαστηρίων δημιουργικής απασχόλησης όπου η γνώση θα προκύπτει πάντα μέσα απο την χαρά του παιχνιδιού. Μερικά από τα εργαστήρια που προγραμματίζουμε για τον πρώτο καιρό λειτουργίας είναι:<br/>κατασκευές παιχνιδιών, κουκλοθέατρο, μουσική, εικαστικά, χοροθέατρο, φυσική, βιολογία, γεωγραφία, βοτανολογία, πολιτική αγωγή.<br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>H ΦΙΛΟΣΟΦΙΑ ΜΑΣ</b><br/>Δεν χρειάζεται να είναι κανείς παιδοψυχολόγος για να καταλάβει πως παιδί και παιχνίδι είναι αλληλένδετα. Φτάνει ο καθένας μας να ανατρέξει με όση μνήμη του έχει μείνει στη παιδική του ηλικία και να θυμηθεί πώς ένα μικρό κλαράκι στην όχθη του ποταμού μεταμορφωνόταν στο δράκο του παραμυθιού, ένα βότσαλο στην πεντόβολα ή ενας κουβάς σε καλάθι του μπάσκετ. Παρόλο που η «πλαστικοποίηση» και η εκβιομηχάνιση του παιχνιδιού είναι κάτι σχετικά πρόσφατο, η περίοδος όπου τα παιδιά είχαν το χωρο-χρόνο τους για να δημιουργούν τα παιχνίδια τους, φαίνεται -τουλάχιστον για τον πολιτισμένο βάρβαρο- κομμάτι κάποιου απροσδιόριστου μακρινού παρελθόντος. Γενικώς επικρατεί η λογική ""δεν προλαβαίνω, δεν προλαβαίνεις, ας το αγοράσουμε..."".<br/></p>
<p><br/>Το παιχνίδι και συνεπώς το παιδί δε γλίτωσαν απ' τη συλλογική φαντασίωση της αέναης ανάπτυξης, όπου ο χωρο-χρόνος της ελεύθερης δημιουργικής ευτυχίας δεν χωράει, ούτε είναι μέρος του καθημερινού ασφυκτικού προγράμματος. Η ""καριέρα"" ξεκινάει νωρίς ώστε να εξασφαλίζεται η ολοένα και περισσότερη απουσία φαντασίας στο παιχνίδι και μετέπειτα στη ζωή. Οι χωρο-χρόνοι αυτοί, ευτυχώς ακόμα επιβιώνουν στις λεγόμενες «υπανάπτυκτες» χώρες -κι ας ακούγεται οξύμωρο- όπου η απουσία «πολιτισμένων» παιχνιδιών διατηρεί ανέπαφη ακόμα την παιδική φαντασία.<br/><br/>Επηρεασμένοι απ τις διδαχές του μεγάλου ισπανού εκπαιδευτικού Φρανσίσκο Φερέρ, για τις πρωτοποριακές για την εποχή του ιδέες, θέλουμε να αναβιώσουμε εναν χώρο εκπαίδευσης που θα καλλιεργεί την αλληλεγγύη, τον σεβασμό στη διαφορετικότητα, την οικονομία με την πρωταρχική της σημασία, την συμμετοχή και την αυτονομία, σε αντίθεση με το μεσαιωνικό σύστημα του υπουργείου παιδείας και θρησκευμάτων(!).<br/><br/>Η χαρά για την γνώση δεν βαθμολογείται!<br/></p>

WHO WE ARE



FatCut
 UPCYCLING is a collaborative network with horizontal structure that 
experiments, creates and transforms seemingly useless objects (garbage) 
in order to give them greater sustainability and re-purpose them into 
useful products and educational toys (upcycling*). It is also a 
laboratory workshop  of ideas and know-how freely available to everyone,
 giving solutions to everyday needs.From cardboard,
 newspapers, plastic bags, pallets, soda caps to damaged water heaters and other 
“garbage”, everything is being processed in order to postpone its arrival to the dump or 
junkyard and to increase its span of life. This way, the already oversized mass 
of garbage is de-congested and the energy cost of consumption is reduced.
 Even the traditional recycling of materials today, as far as we know, 
is not CO2 efficient and involves the huge cost of blue bins which is 
intensified by the lack of state management.FatCut
 UPCYCLING
 was founded 3 years ago. During these years we have published the 1st 
issue of a comic series, we have organized many workshops to show people
 of all ages how to build ecological stoves out of used heaters, glasses
 out of beer bottles and educational toys out of plastic cups, among 
many others. We have held exhibitions touring around the Mediterranean 
Sea with an upcycled sailing boat, Mystic Blue.



*WHAT IS UPCYCLING?
It
 is the process by which discarded materials or damaged products are 
processed into new materials and products of better quality or 
ecological value. The term upcycling was first introduced by Reiner Pilz
 in an article by Thorton Kay from Salvo in 1994. The idea of upcycling 
is about reusing materials and making them useful again or giving them a
 new identity and value. Furthermore, this would help reduce the 
consumption of new raw materials in order to manufacture new products.This reduction in consumption, in turn, leads to a reduction of the 
required energy wasted for their construction (basic cause for the contamination of air, groundwater and the emission of greenhouse gases).Downcycling refers to processing materials and products into new materials of inferior quality. Upcycling,
 on the contrary, uses the entire product, in order to either make it 
useful again or give it a new identity and value.

ABOUT CADO PARADISO

Our next project CADO PARADISO (TRASHCAN PARADISE) is entirely made
 DIT (do-it-together) by our team.    It is based in an old factory in Athens with 240 square 
meters of space.
It’s
 90% UPCYCLED. Flying automatic dragons, castles and trampolines made 
from tires, huge plastic bottle puzzles, PVC tube slides and trashformed
 bicycle games are, among others, the scenery that aims to trigger the 
fantasy of the visitor. A series of workshops including DIY toys, 
geography, physics, biology, political participation and others will be 
introduced to the kids while and through playing.




OUR PHILOSOPHY
You
 don’t need to be a psychologist in order to understand how “child” and 
“play” are interconnected, like the steam-iron and its handle (if the 
handle didn’t exist, you would simply burn). Each one of us only needs 
to go back to his childhood memories (if any left) and remember how a 
small twig transformed into a fairytale dragon or a pebble into the game of stone-tossing ('pentovola' in greek).Although
 the industrialization of the “play” and the “lamination” of toys is 
something relatively recent, the times when children had their time and 
space to create their own games, seems, at least to the civilized 
barbarian, something distant, long gone and forgotten. (I don’t have 
time, you don’t have time, let’s buy it).The
 play and therefore the child are not spared from the collective fantasy
 of perpetual growth, where “space-time” for free creative happiness 
does not fit in nor is part of one’s daily busy schedule. One’s career 
starts early enough so as to ensure, more and more, the lack of 
imagination in the game and later in life. This “spacetime” fortunately,
 still survives in the so-called “underdeveloped” countries, and 
contradictory though it sounds, where the presence of “civilized” toys 
hasn’t castrated the kids’ imagination yet.Influenced
 by the great Spanish educator Francisco Ferrer and his 'Modern School',
 we aim to introduce an educational space-time that will cultivate 
solidarity, respect towards diversity, participation in decision making 
and autonomy in a country that still has a medieval educational system 
based on nationalism and religion. The joy of learning cannot be scored! 

WHAT WE ASK FROM CROWDFUNDERS?

FatCut
 UPCYCLING members belong to vulnerable social groups.Therefore our budget is extremely limited. We hope that you will support our effort so that we can achieve:
- the completion of the construction of cado paradiso space
- the basic operational expenses of the space for the first months (rent, bills)
- maintenance expenses and equipment (paint, tools, flowers and plants, papers & markers, sound system)
- transport expenses (buy/rental of a small van for transporting materials)
- the design of a website and print production of flyers & posters
- fees & legal services for our cooperative (lawyer, accountant etc)
We invite you to support our efforts, so we can reclaim the space-times of freedom and fantasy for the children! By supporting us you also support the need for a creative, out-of-the-box education! You are our only communication sponsors, so please spread this news as smoke-signs, to everybody interested!
Sincerely,
FatCut UpcyclingSotiris, Noha, Takis, Vivi, Dimitris, Vani.

H ΟΜΑΔΑ FAT CUT UPCYCLINGΗ ομάδα Fat Cut Upcycling, είναι ένα συμμετοχικό δίκτυο οριζόντιας δομής με νομική μορφή κοινωνικής συνεταιριστικής επιχείρησης (ΚΟΙΝ.Σ.ΕΠ.).
Πειραματίζεται, δημιουργεί και μεταποιεί μέσω της άμεσης ανακύκλωσης - upcycling* φαινομενικά άχρηστα αντικείμενα, προκειμένου να τους προσδώσει μεγαλύτερη βιωσιμότητα και να τα μετατρέψει σε χρηστικά προϊόντα ή εκπαιδευτικά παιχνίδια. Παράλληλα η ομάδα αποτελεί ένα ανοιχτό εργαστήριο ιδεών και τεχνογνωσίας που διατίθεται ελεύθερα στον καθένα, δίνοντας λύση σε καθημερινές ανάγκες.
Χαρτοκούτες, εφημερίδες, πλαστικές σακούλες, παλέτες, καπάκια, πόρτες και παράθυρα, μικροσκόπια εώς θερμοσίφωνες και άλλα «σκουπίδια», μετά από επεξεργασία, αναβάλλουν το ραντεβού τους με τη χωματερή και αυξάνουν το μέσο όρο ζωής τους. Κάπως έτσι, αποσυμφορίζουμε τον ήδη υπερμεγέθη όγκο σκουπιδιών και μειώνουμε το ενεργειακό κόστος της κατανάλωσης γνωρίζοντας ότι ακόμα και η παραδοσιακή ανακύκλωση (όπως την ξέρουμε σήμερα) δεν φείδεται εκπομπών διοξειδίου του άνθρακα.
Είμαστε σε λειτουργία ήδη 3 έτη, όπου μέσα σ' αυτά έχουμε πραγματοποιήσει εργαστήρια τεχνογνωσίας (workshops) για την επανοικειοποίηση πρώτων υλών που πετιούνται. Στα εργαστήρια αυτά ασχοληθήκαμε με τη κατασκευή οικολογικών σομπών, ποτηριών, πρεσών για καύσιμο πέλετ και εκπαιδευτικών παιχνιδιών μεταξύ πολλών άλλων. Επίσης στην ίδια φιλοσοφία και λογική, έχουμε εκδόσει το πρώτο τεύχος μιας σειράς κόμικ απο σκουπίδια (Trashformers), έχουμε συμμετάσχει και πραγματοποιήσει εκθέσεις, εκδηλώσεις και περιοδείες σε Ελλάδα, Ιταλία και Γαλλία, με όχημα ενα upcycled ιστιοφόρο (Mystic Blue Eco-Sailing). 

*ΛΙΓΑ ΛΟΓΙΑ ΓΙΑ ΤΟ UPCYCLINGΕίναι η διαδικασία κατά την οποία, πεταμένα υλικά
 ή χαλασμένα προϊόντα μεταποιούνται σε νέα υλικά και προϊόντα καλύτερης 
ποιότητας ή οικολογικής αξίας. Η πρώτη φορά που καταγράφτηκε ο όρος 
upcycling ήταν από τον Reiner Pilz σε ένα άρθρο του Thorton Kay από το 
Salvo το 1994. Ο όρος upcycling, που σε ελεύθερη μετάφραση σημαίνει 
υπερκύκλωση, ήταν τίτλος του βιβλίου του γερμανού Gunter Pauli το 1996.
Το Downcycling είναι η συμβατική ανακύκλωση, δηλαδή η διαδικασία μεταποίησης υλών και 
προϊόντων σε νέα υλικά κατώτερης ποιότητας, αυξάνοντας ταυτόχρονα τις εργοστασιακές εκπομπες διοξειδίου του άνθρακα (CO2) στην ατμόσφαιρα. 
Το Upcycling, αντίθετα, 
χρησιμοποιεί εξ'ολοκλήρου το προϊόν, είτε καθιστώντας το εκ νέου 
χρήσιμο, είτε προσδίδοντάς του νέα ιδιότητα και αξία, μειώνοντας το ενεργειακό κόστος και τις εκπομπές ρύπων και αυξάνοντας την εφευρετικότητα και την δημιουργικότητα του ανθρώπου.
ΤΟ ""ΚΑΔΟ ΠΑΡΑΝΤΙΣΟ""Το παρόν υπέρ-εγχείρημα της Fat Cut ονομάζεται ""ΚΑΔΟ ΠΑΡΑΝΤΙΣΟ"" και μέχρι τη στιγμή αυτή κατασκευάζεται αποκλειστικά από μέλη της ομάδας μας σε μια διαδικασία D.I.T (do-it-together). Πρόκειται για έναν χώρο 240τ.μ, στην οδό Εριγόνης 3, στα Κάτω Πετράλωνα της Αθήνας, που φιλοδοξεί να φιλοξενήσει παιδιά όλων των ηλικιών, προκειμένου να παίξουν, να απασχοληθούν δημιουργικά και να εκπαιδευτούν σε τεχνικές κατασκευής upcycled παιχνιδιών και χρηστικών αντικειμένων.Ο παιχνιδοχώρος ""ΚΑΔΟ ΠΑΡΑΝΤΙΣΟ"" κατασκευάζεται κατα 90% απο φύρα.

They would have the time, space and resources to continue their education at home. In short, they would have a fighting chance of getting a decent education. Of course, we don't live in a perfect world, and many children get only the most basic of educations, if they get one at all.There are many wonderful charities and organisations doing everything they can to improve matters on the ground - building schools, training teachers, and so on. But these efforts can only bear fruit if they get the support they need to deliver on their potential. Without the right resources, schools and their pupils struggle, and eventually fail.And that is where you can come in.We are establishing a charity whose sole function in life is to create world-class learning resources, in a range of languages, and make those resources available to education organisations, schools, teachers (and most importantly, their pupils) for free.If you speak English, there are plenty of resources out there (albeit of highly variable quality), but if you speak any other language, the choice of good materials drops dramatically. It doesn't need to be this way. If you want materials in the same professional, easy-to-use style across an entire syllabus, you will be out of luck. It doesn't have to be this way. If you are looking for materials for children with special needs, it can be a real nightmare. It doesn't need to be this way.This is a long-haul project; we are talking tens of thousands of resources spread across a wide range of ages and subjects. Today though, we are just looking for your help to get us started - to get the charity set up and to create and make available our first thousand or so resources. This is enough to demonstrate what can be achieved, and make a viable case for funding by governments and international organisations.With your help, this can be the beginning of a truly fantastic journey. Educating the next generation has to be about the most important endeavour that we as a race can undertake. We are going to help countless thousands of children reach out for a better life.Why not help us make it happen?",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""text-align: left; letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Child Angel concept evolved from the personal experience of the founder of Child Angel, Andrew Purcell, after losing his young son </span><span style=""text-align: left; letter-spacing: 0px;"">in a shopping centre, after turning his back for only a few seconds. Three years of research and development later, Child Angel pushes the </span><span style=""text-align: left; letter-spacing: 0px;"">boundaries of technology to create a revolutionary product that makes a genuine difference.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Built from the ground up by some of the UK’s leading product and electronic design engineers , Child Angel is one of the smallest, mobile-connected GPS tracking devices in the world that comes in a design that kids love. </p>
</div>
<div>We at Child Angel have created a device which is designed to be worn by children of 3 years and above.  We envisage that this product will be used by families to give information to Parents or carers concerning the constant location of their children as well as providing the reassurance that in an emergency the Parent will be alerted straight away via an App on their Smartphone or Tablet.</div>

But you could only monitor the people moving in and out of your Bluetooth's range, which is most likely a 10-meter (33-foot) circle around you. If you wanted to track your child, you'd have to visually locate your childs physical device and follow them around all day.</div>

<b>
Data roaming</b> is when your phone connects to the Internet when you’re out and about to keep certain applications up-to-date or provide access to some of your apps. This enables Child Angel to track your child without limitation and should a GPS signal not be available, you have the additional security of WiFi &amp; GSM to report the location of your child. Child Angel have secured a very low monthly roaming fee for our inbuilt micro sim so we know our little angels are safe and know where they are! We expect this to be in the region of 40 cents (25 pence) per day.<br/>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Challenges</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We have been working for the last three years developing Child Angel, listening to feed back from our parent and child surveys so we can deliver a product that truly enhances your ability to monitor your child's whereabouts and is also fun to wear.</div>
<div><b>Manufacturing</b></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We need to have the tooling to manufacture the various components of Child Angel and due to the complex nature of this process it will take time and money to get it right. We have selected partners to work with through this process so if complications do arise the impact on bringing Child Angel to market will be</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> minimised.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Software</b></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The software and app are functional, however there is still some final work that is needed to build all the features that we want in Child Angel. We have a fantastic team working with us, however software development can sometimes be tricky so we want to reassure you that if needed we will look for additional support to solve any problems that emerge.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We will undoubtedly encounter some problems along the way, however we are prepared for this and have the team available to tackle any challenges as we have done over the last three years. We aim to deliver Child Angel on time, however we wont compromise on the quality of our product and therefore some delays may be experienced if we meet the unexpected.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Colour Options</b></span></div>
<div>The more pledges we receive the more colours we will be able to offer.</div>

<p><i>Q - Is there a danger with these devices
that they are relied on too heavily – should parents rely solely on Child
Angel™  to look after their children?</i></p>
<p><i>A- No, our product is aimed to create that
little extra feeling of knowing where our little ones are and it is not
designed to replace Parental Responsibility, merely to enhance it.</i></p>
<p><i>Parents should make sure that their
children understand the importance of being aware of the dangers around them,
particularly ‘stranger danger’, and Child Angel™  in no way detracts from
that message.</i></p>
<p><i>Q - Do you think that children should have
more independence and not be able to be traced as part of their daily
lives?  Do you think that this device may detract from their own coping
strategies?</i></p>
<p><i>A- Child Angel™ brings a little more
comfort to parents in the thought that out of sight does not mean children are
non-visible.  Children still need to develop their own strengths and weaknesses
to be able to feel confident in the real world but at the same time, parents
like to know where they are.</i></p>
<p><i>Q-  How can you assure parents that
the data concerning their child’s location will be treated in a secure manner?</i></p>
<p><i>A- Child Angel™ has been developed so that
only the parent/carer will ever have access to the child’s location.  With
our product the parent is in control: it is not a ‘phone or a text-enabled
device’ and the pairing is via a unique PIN recognition system that recycles
every time the Child Angel™  is reconnected, reducing the risk of unwanted
tracking.  This is also essential when used by the likes of theme parks,
sports clubs, shopping centres etc, to hire out on a daily basis.</i></p>
<p><i>Child Angel™  is designed so that the
position of the child can be securely reported back to a specific parent’s
phone or tablet. The device and service are optimised to provide position
reporting with a good balance of coverage performance, battery life, and
size/weight.</i></p>

</div></div>","The Child Angel concept evolved from the personal experience of the founder of Child Angel, Andrew Purcell, after losing his young son in a shopping centre, after turning his back for only a few seconds. Three years of research and development later, Child Angel pushes the boundaries of technology to create a revolutionary product that makes a genuine difference.



Built from the ground up by some of the UK’s leading product and electronic design engineers , Child Angel is one of the smallest, mobile-connected GPS tracking devices in the world that comes in a design that kids love. 

We at Child Angel have created a device which is designed to be worn by children of 3 years and above.  We envisage that this product will be used by families to give information to Parents or carers concerning the constant location of their children as well as providing the reassurance that in an emergency the Parent will be alerted straight away via an App on their Smartphone or Tablet.







Child Angel is one of the smallest and most advanced child tracking devices available in the world today. The product of extensive research and development, Child Angel provides safe and stable location monitoring by combining GPS, GSM and Wi-Fi hot-spot triangulation technologies. 




What is different
about Child Angel from other tracking devices.



Plenty of other devices can work out their position from GPS and Wi-Fi, and report this back to a monitor using the mobile phone networks. Child AngelTM is the first device that is optimised so that it can be strapped to a child, and allow simple “contact us” commands to be sent, and alarm reporting to be received (e.g. strap undone).




Portable, lightweight and splash proof design.
Alarmed Strap
The Child Angel design includes an alarmed strap that is designed to give parents extra peace of mind knowing their child can contact them in an emergency. Should the strap be undone, Child Angel sends an alert to a paired smartphone device to advise it that the strap has been released.




Child Angel App



Child’s play to use and complete with a variety of intuitive features


Create your own safe zones with the Child Angel App Geo-fence feature to trigger receive alerts whenever the Child Angel GPS Tracker enters or exits those areas. Open the App to see at a glance the location of where your loved one is. Should your child undo the Child Angel alarmed strap- the App will notify you that the device has been removed and provide a last known location.





   


GPS v Bluetooth and why we need data roaming


A GPS tracking unit is a device that uses the Global Positioning System to determine the precise location of your child to which it is attached and to record the position of your child at regular intervals.
Locating several Bluetooth users with a typical mobile phone is relatively simple: You just turn on your phone and search for every discoverable device. But you could only monitor the people moving in and out of your Bluetooth's range, which is most likely a 10-meter (33-foot) circle around you. If you wanted to track your child, you'd have to visually locate your childs physical device and follow them around all day.



Data roaming is when your phone connects to the Internet when you’re out and about to keep certain applications up-to-date or provide access to some of your apps. This enables Child Angel to track your child without limitation and should a GPS signal not be available, you have the additional security of WiFi & GSM to report the location of your child. Child Angel have secured a very low monthly roaming fee for our inbuilt micro sim so we know our little angels are safe and know where they are! We expect this to be in the region of 40 cents (25 pence) per day.


What our surveys said?





K Hardwill ""Great idea to know where your kids are and looks really trendy, my kids will love wearing it!""
V Hale ""I really like the fact i can have both of my children's Child Angel's on one phone or tablet at the same time and they can personalise them, wow, what a great idea!""
R Fowler ""As a teacher it will be great to have all the class wearing one on a school trip and all on my tablet, brilliant""


Why Child Angel needs your help We now have a working prototype from our manufacturer and  need at least $100,000 to pay for the costs of everything that's needed to put 'Child Angel' into production. Your donations will be used to fund tooling, production and additional software. Every penny will be used to make 'Child Angel' a reality.
Be an Angel and pledge ...in return you will be one of the first in the world to own a truly unique, secure and trendy child location device. Your little angels have been at the centre of our development programme and we have designed a personalisation feature...the clip on faceplate, that they can interchange and make their Child Angel special to them.





So why should you support us?
 We are passionate about are journey in helping parents monitor their childrens whereabouts but without restricting the freedom a child needs to develop. You have personally experienced one of those anxious moments like myself and understand how Child Angel can make a difference. Be one of the first to own a Child Angel with the total satisfaction that your contribution helped turn this into a reality.    The Impact We are a small but passionate company and we need your help to make the final steps. Every donation matters to us, as this campaign determines whether or not we can continue working on Child Angel or not.  With your contributions, we can bring Child Angel into the world and you could have an angel looking over your loved ones.
    Challenges

We have been working for the last three years developing Child Angel, listening to feed back from our parent and child surveys so we can deliver a product that truly enhances your ability to monitor your child's whereabouts and is also fun to wear.
Manufacturing

We need to have the tooling to manufacture the various components of Child Angel and due to the complex nature of this process it will take time and money to get it right. We have selected partners to work with through this process so if complications do arise the impact on bringing Child Angel to market will be minimised.

Software
The software and app are functional, however there is still some final work that is needed to build all the features that we want in Child Angel. We have a fantastic team working with us, however software development can sometimes be tricky so we want to reassure you that if needed we will look for additional support to solve any problems that emerge.
We will undoubtedly encounter some problems along the way, however we are prepared for this and have the team available to tackle any challenges as we have done over the last three years. We aim to deliver Child Angel on time, however we wont compromise on the quality of our product and therefore some delays may be experienced if we meet the unexpected.
Colour Options
The more pledges we receive the more colours we will be able to offer.

Who I am: My name is Vicky Pierce and I am an Infant Developmental Specialist with over 20 years of experience providing early intervention therapies to young children and their families. What I do: My special expertise is in helping families learn and use positive parenting techniques with their children. However, I find myself sounding like a broken record (remember those?!), repeating this same information in most every house that I go to, month after month and year after year.</p>
<p>So, I'm creating an awesome new app that will grab a much wider audience and help me spread the good parenting word in order to make the world a happier, more peaceful place. How it works: The focus of the Tantrum911! app is on positive reinforcement of ""good"" behavior, while helping parents feel competent in reducing the frequency and duration of “bad” behavior. Tantrum911! will be free for the basics and there will be three In-App purchases for 99 cents each.</p>
<p>I call the first one Planes, Trains and Automobiles. This will address special behavior challenges such as those encountered in a hot car in the first 5 minutes of a 3 day road trip, on a nice long flight to India or an extended overnight ride on the EuroStar.</p>
<p>The second one is a handy, dandy timer to keep track of those time-out minutes. The 3rd In-App purchase will be a “Reward” – A reward page for children to use when they are behaving well. Perhaps I'll add a reward page for their parents who, let's face it, are trying their best to behave well in the face of toddler adversity!</p>
<p>Why it works: Because I really do know what I'm doing and lets face it, we could all use a lot less screaming and kicking from the children in our world! Just think how nice that next airplane trip will be without a screaming toddler kicking the back of your already-cramped, over-priced Coach seat, causing you to spill your adult beverage right when the pilots have just turned on the Fasten Seat Belt sign.</p>
<p>Trust me, you want this app to fly!! Seriously, Tantrum911! is on the cutting-edge of a relatively untapped niche in the app market. I teach these menthods every day and they work. Every single parent with a toddler can benefit from this app, and there is nothing else like it available. The money you donate will be used exclusively for developing and marketing the app so that ALL families can access its positive parenting message and we can all live happily ever after. It will be made available in English and Spanish and other languages as the entire world eventually catches on.</p></div>","Welcome to my project!!!

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>CampInteractive (CI) is a Bronx-based nonprofit that inspires underprivileged inner-city youth through the creative power of technology.  </p>
<p>At CI, students are transitioned from consumers of media to creative and critically thinking producers. Through learning coding, photography, videography, website building, and blogging, students are able to cultivate a voice that will be heard and seen through various channels.  These skills are then used to document their personal journey in exciting outdoor adventures such as: surfing, hiking, rock climbing, snowboarding, sailing, camping, and more.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this intensive program, CI students are given the opportunity to intern at top NYC technology companies -- giving them the real-world experience that will ensure success.</p>
<h2>Who do we serve?</h2>
<p>CI operates in one of New York City’s poorest neighborhoods where the income and education quality are at their worst. In our community:</p>
<ul>
<li>40% of households live below the Poverty Line</li>
<li>25% of households subsist on less than $10,000 annually</li>
<li>The average student to teacher ratio is 35:1</li>

<li><em>Less than 12% of Bachelors Degrees in Computer Sciences are earned by minorities</em></li>

<p>We know these stats. We firmly believe that teaching hard skills in web development, IT, quality assurance, and creative technology disciplines to this demographic is the best way to break the cycle of poverty. </p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Students
 Active For Ending Rape (SAFER) began in 2000 as a group of students at 
Columbia University who led the campus in a grassroots campaign to 
reform the school’s sexual assault policy. More than ten years later, 
SAFER is a national nonprofit organization that empowers students across
 the country to change how their colleges prevent and 
respond to sexual assault. A volunteer-led organization, SAFER 
facilitates student organizing through a comprehensive training manual (PDF); in-person workshops and trainings; free follow-up mentoring; our SAFER/V-Day Campus Accountability Project Database; and a growing online resource library for student organizers.Visit our website to read more about SAFER and its history.

Why SAFER?



We are the only organization that fights sexual violence and rape culture by empowering student-led campaigns to reform college sexual assault policies.


We recognize how sexual assault is connected to all forms of individual and institutional oppression including racism, sexism, and homo/transphobia.


We create leaders by training students in effective organizing tactics


We teach students how to build inclusive movements
 that involve people of identities that vary (for example: gender, race,
 ability, sexual orientation, nationality, and ethnicity) so everyone’s voice is heard.


POLICY, POLICY, POLICY

We believe that a good policy is the key
 to a strong anti-sexual violence program on campus. Today, most 
colleges and universities have dangerously inadequate policies with 
procedures that can leave victims feeling retraumatized, deny students 
due process, and ignore disparate treatment of survivors and assailants 
based on gender, class, race, sexual orientation, and disability. By 
keeping these inadequate policies, colleges are allowing an atmosphere 
that condones violence, silences survivors, and reduces equal access to the benefits of a college educationWant to learn more about policy? Visit our website to learn more about what makes a comprehensive sexual assault policy. You can also view our Youtube video about why policy is important to an anti-violence movement.

The Impact
Sexual violence is the number one violent crime on college campuses.  The Department of Justice found that at least 1 in 4 women are survivors of campus sexual violence. This important issue has been getting a lot more attention recently with an investigation by the Center for Public Integrity, an award-winning series by NPR, the latest Dear Colleague Letter regarding Title IX from the Office for Civil Rights, and coverage of the impact of campus sexual assault in  Cosmopolitan magazine. 

 With the increased visibility of the issue, more students are seeking 
our services. Demand for our trainings has grown over 200% in the past two years and we need your help to increase our capacity and meet that need. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
With your help, we can raise $7,000. By helping us expand our capacity, your donation will help pay for:


mentors that provide FREE one-on-one guidance to student activists;

bringing trainers to the schools of student activists across the country;
educating college staff and students about the unique dynamics of sexual assault on college campuses;
allowing student groups of ANY budget to bring SAFER to campus.

</div></div>","We want to inspire children to read multicultural books. We do this through our adorable and relatable characters Suno, Dekho Jaano and our age-appropriate stories that allow children to experience our beautiful Indian culture. Our popular books are fun and authentic while being mainstream, which appeals to kids, parents, and educators of all ethnicities and backgrounds. In return of your generous contribution, you can choose from a host of rewards based on your pledge including: free shipping, EARLY BIRD SPECIAL OFFERS, signed copies of both the Paratha and Diwali books or even translating the book to the language of your choice. 








The Mystery of the missing parathas takes kids through a fun food adventure. It's a story that will make them wear detective hats as they hunt for the parathas ( Indian flat bread) that suddenly go missing right before Suno’s Dadima’s (grandma) going away party.
Here is a sneak peak of the book:









This page turner will not only make you wonder who stole the parathas but will let you experience the sights and smells found in an Indian home along the way. It is sure to make the pickiest of eaters want to try some parathas or even cook them!

In the past, we have had great success with our award winning and popular Indian book, The Diwali Gift and our Dress Up Party App. Our books was sold out across the country and we received great response from parents, grandparents, teachers and more importantly kids! 
We now can’t wait to bring this mouthwatering adventure story to our young readers!


BACKERS TESTIMONYOur research showed that even though schools and communities have become a melting pot of cultures, we as parents and educators do not have the tools to share Indian culture with young kids.Currently, only 10% of mainstream children’s media such as TV, books and Apps have any characters of color. Out of these, there are none that depicts South Asians in positive and prominent roles. So where are those fun books? We surely could not find them in bookstores and libraries. We urgently need more avenues for the next generation of kids to validate their cultural roots.We want to change the way the world views Indians and break away from current stereotypes.That is why we're making beautifully illustrated hardback books for kids. We write our stories in a way such that kids can relate to the characters and become curious about Indian culture while having fun. For educators, we offer great kid-oriented content which can be easily shared in their multicultural classrooms.The 3 Curious Monkeys; Suno, Dekho, and Jaano get little readers interested in the story and help them absorb the cultural references more deeply while encouraging them to respond with curiosity.  All are characters ( 1 girl and 2 boy monkeys) are equally involved in being funny, silly, kind, smart, confident, and adventurous thus breaking any gender stereotypes.

<i><br/><br/>IBAN: BG57UNCR70001522407739<br/>BIC: UNCRBGSF<br/>Chitalishte Hamalogika <br/><br/></i></b>For the past 3 years our team have  been working on cultural, educational and social innovation projects in Bulgaria <i>(see our work <a href=""http://hamalogika.com/en/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>)</i>. The objective we have set ourselves is to establish the role of culture as a driving force in the processes of sustainable development of our society.<br/><br/><p>Now we’ve reached the point where we need our own place, where we can freely experiment with visionаry ideas for social change. We believe that change depends on each and every one of us and starts with where you live. So we start from Burgas with a creative community hub - a place where people can be educated, inspired, entertained, and brought together in new ways. <br/></p><p>We chose the widely spread and extremely effective model of “a creative hub”, because it 
really helps the interactions between artists, NGOs and the business 
sector in order to stimulate а positive impact. A hub that generates ideas for the well being of the members of different communities. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h4>
<span>Why do we need your help?</span><span></span>
</h4><p></p><h4></h4><p></p><p>Despite our efforts to open the hub at the end of the summer, it just didn’t happen. Thanks to the help of our local community, we have managed to secure a space and finish a great part of the construction works. <br/></p><p></p>However, we are still far from done! To make the place fully functional and truly inspirational for students, artists and entrepreneurs, we have to be sure it meets their expectations.<br/><br/><p>In order to do that we really need your help! We believe that the most sustainable and meaningful support is by the people for the people, that’s why we chose the Crowdfunding method. By pledging to the campaign, you are directly supporting the hub and helping us open as soon as possible. We are hoping to reach the goal of € 6,000 to ensure we have the budget to renovate, furnish and equip the space; to purchase books for the library and organize our first events.<br/></p>We are truly grateful to everyone who can support us!<br/><br/><p></p><h4>

Greetings from Hamalogika!With your help we are building a creative community hub in Burgas, Bulgaria.Our crowdfunding campaign has ended, but if you wish to support us, you can make a donation to the following bank account:
IBAN: BG57UNCR70001522407739BIC: UNCRBGSFChitalishte Hamalogika For the past 3 years our team have  been working on cultural, educational and social innovation projects in Bulgaria (see our work here). The objective we have set ourselves is to establish the role of culture as a driving force in the processes of sustainable development of our society.Now we’ve reached the point where we need our own place, where we can freely experiment with visionаry ideas for social change. We believe that change depends on each and every one of us and starts with where you live. So we start from Burgas with a creative community hub - a place where people can be educated, inspired, entertained, and brought together in new ways. We chose the widely spread and extremely effective model of “a creative hub”, because it 
really helps the interactions between artists, NGOs and the business 
sector in order to stimulate а positive impact. A hub that generates ideas for the well being of the members of different communities. 
Why do we need your help?
Despite our efforts to open the hub at the end of the summer, it just didn’t happen. Thanks to the help of our local community, we have managed to secure a space and finish a great part of the construction works. However, we are still far from done! To make the place fully functional and truly inspirational for students, artists and entrepreneurs, we have to be sure it meets their expectations.In order to do that we really need your help! We believe that the most sustainable and meaningful support is by the people for the people, that’s why we chose the Crowdfunding method. By pledging to the campaign, you are directly supporting the hub and helping us open as soon as possible. We are hoping to reach the goal of € 6,000 to ensure we have the budget to renovate, furnish and equip the space; to purchase books for the library and organize our first events.We are truly grateful to everyone who can support us!
What have we done so far?
This campaign is the last part of a long process, in which we’ve already managed to:

find and rent a 140 sq.m. space in downtown Burgas, that was deserted for about a decade 




demolish a few unnecessary walls and take down the very old suspended ceiling 




We've also provided: 
laminated flooring; 

railing for amphitheatеr stairs; 

wooden material for the covering of the stairs, the bookshelves and the working spaces; 

2 air conditioners; 

tiling; 

the rising support of new members.




What's next?




We still have a long way to go. Here’s a list of materials and services we need before launching:



office
furnishing


electrical wiring
and installation

professional
sound system and lighting, dance floor

walls (movable
and massive), doors and curtains


wall installation
for exhibitions;

multimedia
- projector, screen, laptops, microphones, etc.


library, audio
and video fund
kitchen and WC appliances;


specific services for the things we cannot carry out ourselves
If you like to donate materials, services or directly purchase some of the stuff  (instead of or alongside a pledge), please  email or call us. We’d love to have a chat!




Other ways to help 




Let the world know about our campaign! Share, tweet, post and email your friends near and far! The more the people support us, the sooner we’ll open our doors for a lovely crowd of innovators and creators!
We know that by asking for your help, we are asking for your trust. Here you can find more detailed information about Hamalogika Hub and our long term plans.






The Hub: what should you expect?



In our work we are always looking for opportunities to mix art with science, 
architecture, design, technology, education, ecology, etc. Through innovative approaches we will introduce non-conventional 
cultural products, art works and world practices.We imagine Hamalogika Hub to be:

Shared space: a place for work, fun and creativity, inspiration and education;


Culture Hub: gathering place for people, organizations and artists; a meet-up space for discussions, study and analysis, ideas and creation; 


Info point for the most interesting initiatives in Burgas.


What do we offer?

Here’s an example of what a regular week might include:

lectures, seminars and training sessions, presentations;
team building events and group sessions;
professional consultations in the field of culture, art, modern education and social innovations;

workshops and educational courses for kids and adults;
festivals, forums, conferences and business events;
music and literature events, movie nights, game nights etc.
international art residencies and cultural exchange -  visiting artists who will import/export creative potential to and from the city and will stimulate  intercultural dialogue.


Visit our webpage to see examples of projects and workshops we have already completed.


Impact: Why does it matter?
We believe culture is not only a communal good, but also an 
active tool, contributing to the economic growth of cities, to the 
creation of new jobs and to the sоcial closeness. One of the main challenges and a big wish for us is to stimulate participation of all stakeholders in the sustainable development of the city through culture.

<p>When
Will Kiefer was a senior at Franklin &amp; Marshall College, he volunteered as a mentor and personal
trainer for Lancaster's at-risk youth and learned about the severity of the
vicious cycle that was trapping these kids in jails and court rooms.</p>
<p>Following graduation, Will dedicated
himself to advancing the lives of these at-risk youth. He couldn't walk away
from his students  nor could he watch
from the sidelines. These young men desperately needed support and guidance; thus,
Bench Mark Program was born.</p>
<p>Bench Mark Program was born out of necessity. At-risk
youth typically don't respond well to traditional therapy or parole meetings.
Put simply, they don't want to talk about their feelings to people they can't
trust. Bench Mark Program provides a more effective outlet for them -- one
where they can just be themselves while receiving unconditional and long-term
support.</p><div>

<p><b>Bench Mark Program is a nonprofit that advances the lives of at-risk youth in Lancaster, PA. The streets sell a lifestyle rooted in brotherhood, protection, and opportunity – but with the potential for great personal costs. Bench Mark Program invests in our at-risk youth, providing these perceived street benefits without risk. We are a strength-based family of mentors who use exercise, academic counseling, and goal-achievement as the means to a successful future. While life on the streets is temporary, Bench Mark Program commits to our students’ well-being and happiness for as long as they need.</b></p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Bench Mark Program’s intent is to relocate its facility directly
within the neighborhoods where its students live, attend school, and spend free
time. The new facility will allow Bench Mark Program to accommodate more
students as well as expand its emphasis on academic and employment related
services. To better serve the target population, the new Bench Mark Program
facility will serve as a positive safe house within the community that is easily
accessible to youth as well as other support providers.</p>
<p>Fundraising Goal: $25,000</p>

<p>1. 
$12,000: base rent for 2,400 square feet warehouse

</h3><h3><i>“Damn everything but the circus! ...damn everything that is grim, dull, motionless, unrisking...That won't throw it's heart into the tension, surprise, fear and delight”</i></h3>
<h3>E. E. Cummings</h3>
<div><br/></div><p><b>About Me</b></p><p>In brief, I am a burlesquer, cabaret artist and performer from Scotland who has spent the last five years of my life pursuing the seemingly unattainable goal of becoming a professional circus artist.</p><p>I am 31 years old, not a gymnast, nor a professionally trained dancer, but I did fall in love with the beauty and expressive potential of circus, and on June 28th 2013 after years of training hard at Aerial Edge (Glasgow) and at Circus Warehouse (New York), I was offered a place to study on the degree programme at the National Centre for Circus Arts (formerly The Circus Space) in London!</p><p>I could hardly believe it was true! The NCCA is one of only a handful of institutions in the world that offers degree level training in Circus Arts, it is internationally renowned and receives many hundreds of applications every year; it felt like being accepted to Oxford or Harvard!</p><p>Being accepted onto the course really is a once in a lifetime opportunity  to make a wild and passionate leap of faith towards the future; to push my body and my creativity not only to the next level, but to the very brink, and to learn the skills required to produce meaningful work in contemporary circus.</p><p>Contemporary Circus is more than just big tops and touring shows. It has moved on to encompass aspects of physical theatre, contemporary movement theory, and expressive narrative. It has established itself as a respected discipline, while still retaining the magic and spectacle of its heritage. It is a medium that deals essentially with movement and the human form, and so it has a special ability to transcend barriers of language and culture to really connect and resonate with audiences of all types.</p><div><br/></div><b>My Circus Story So Far....</b><div>
<h3></h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">After a frantic few weeks of packing and selling almost everything I owned, I said goodbye to my friends, my family and my home and set off for London with no fixed address to go to, but high hopes of what I could achieve. However, during my first term on the course SAAS, the government agency that deals with Scottish student funding, decided not to offer me any support to pay my tuition fees as I am classed as an Independent Student who already holds qualifications. Despite many months of appeals from myself, the NCCA and various mental health charities, SAAS refused to change their decision. </span><br/></p>
<p>The National Centre kindly allowed me to continue on with the course while I looked for alternative sources of funding, but despite the desperate state of both my finances and my mental health, I couldn't find anywhere that was able to give me any support - I just didn't meet their requirements; whether it was age, nationality, background, what I was studying, or where I had come from, nowhere was prepared to offer me financial assistance. </p>
<p>After nearly a year of couch surfing, earning, saving, and writing to countless organisations and institutions while still training full time, I sadly came up empty handed, and had to leave the course in July 2014 after completing the first year of the degree.</p>
<p>So, after only one year on the most incredible course I could have imagined, I had to return home, broke, depressed, disheartened, and owing the NCCA more than £6000 in unpaid fees.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>...Since then....</b></p>
<p>After a long period of soul searching, continuing to train and more than a little TLC from my amazing friends, I managed to pay off what I owed to the NCCA, and gather myself together to look towards returning.</p>
<p>It would be easy to see this year out as wasted time, but I have tried to see it as an important development, both personally and professionally: I have learned flying trapeze, aerial cradle and straps, taught Tightwire, co-directed an ensemble circus show, and, for the first time ever, done more work in circus than in any other art form. </p>
<p>It has been a hard but fruitful year, and after a successful re-audition, the NCCA have allowed me to return to the degree programme this September!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b></b></h3>
<p><b>About The National Centre for Circus Arts </b></p>
<p>The tuition fees for the NCCA are set at £9000 per year.</p>
<p>This is on-par with the most prestigious degrees in Dance, Drama, Music and Fine Art available in the UK at the moment. It is a large amount of money, but it has every right to be, as this is one of the most demanding and selective of courses, and is accredited by the London Conservatoire for Dance and Drama. </p>
<p>The programme is very physically intensive, and classes are full time Monday to Friday, with some of the best teachers in the industry. Former graduates have gone on work internationally, to found their own award winning companies. and to work for Cirque du Soleil!</p>

<p><br/></p>
<b>Money!</b><p>When I left the NCCA in June 2014 I owed them over £6000 in unpaid fees. After a great deal of hard work (and an amazing first Crowdfunding campaign!) I was able to pay them back, and even managed to raise the first instalment of tuition fees needed to return this September (2015). </p>
<p>This Campaign is to raise the last £3000 I need to complete the Second year of training and gain my Foundation Degree in Circus Arts!</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b></b></h3>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The Perks</b></p>
<p>The world of 'The Circus' can seem like an almost mystical place, far removed from the majority of people's lives. The Perks I have on offer for this campaign show something of what it is I do, allow people to experience some of the magic of the modern Circus, and see first-hand how their donations are helping me to progress. </p>
<p>I am so very humbled by any and all donations that people choose to make, and I am hoping to deliver many of the Perks as shortly after the campaign ends as possible, though some, such as ""Starter for Ten"", ""Circus - Live!"" and  ""Circus VIP"" will take a little longer to deliver.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>By donating, you will be helping me to return to my place on the Foundation Degree at the National Centre for Circus Arts, and train at one of the most prestigious schools in the world. I will not only be learning some of the best circus technique, but will also be given classes in dance, theatre, performance and production planning. </p>
<p>These skills will not only help me to develop as an individual, but also give me the opportunity to make a contribute to the wider performing arts industry. After graduating I am intending to make my own work, and also help support the work and developments of others, and pass on the unique skills I have gained to the next generation artists. </p>
<p>I believe that circus is elemental, astounding and sincere, because it uses as its medium the one thing that we all still share and have in common: the human body, with all of its incredible potential, and devastating vulnerability. </p>
<p>I hope that people have enjoyed the work I've made so far, and dare to hope they may be interested to see what I could do in the future if I reach my goal. </p>

E. E. Cummings
About MeIn brief, I am a burlesquer, cabaret artist and performer from Scotland who has spent the last five years of my life pursuing the seemingly unattainable goal of becoming a professional circus artist.I am 31 years old, not a gymnast, nor a professionally trained dancer, but I did fall in love with the beauty and expressive potential of circus, and on June 28th 2013 after years of training hard at Aerial Edge (Glasgow) and at Circus Warehouse (New York), I was offered a place to study on the degree programme at the National Centre for Circus Arts (formerly The Circus Space) in London!I could hardly believe it was true! The NCCA is one of only a handful of institutions in the world that offers degree level training in Circus Arts, it is internationally renowned and receives many hundreds of applications every year; it felt like being accepted to Oxford or Harvard!Being accepted onto the course really is a once in a lifetime opportunity  to make a wild and passionate leap of faith towards the future; to push my body and my creativity not only to the next level, but to the very brink, and to learn the skills required to produce meaningful work in contemporary circus.Contemporary Circus is more than just big tops and touring shows. It has moved on to encompass aspects of physical theatre, contemporary movement theory, and expressive narrative. It has established itself as a respected discipline, while still retaining the magic and spectacle of its heritage. It is a medium that deals essentially with movement and the human form, and so it has a special ability to transcend barriers of language and culture to really connect and resonate with audiences of all types.My Circus Story So Far....


After a frantic few weeks of packing and selling almost everything I owned, I said goodbye to my friends, my family and my home and set off for London with no fixed address to go to, but high hopes of what I could achieve. However, during my first term on the course SAAS, the government agency that deals with Scottish student funding, decided not to offer me any support to pay my tuition fees as I am classed as an Independent Student who already holds qualifications. Despite many months of appeals from myself, the NCCA and various mental health charities, SAAS refused to change their decision. 
The National Centre kindly allowed me to continue on with the course while I looked for alternative sources of funding, but despite the desperate state of both my finances and my mental health, I couldn't find anywhere that was able to give me any support - I just didn't meet their requirements; whether it was age, nationality, background, what I was studying, or where I had come from, nowhere was prepared to offer me financial assistance. 
After nearly a year of couch surfing, earning, saving, and writing to countless organisations and institutions while still training full time, I sadly came up empty handed, and had to leave the course in July 2014 after completing the first year of the degree.
So, after only one year on the most incredible course I could have imagined, I had to return home, broke, depressed, disheartened, and owing the NCCA more than £6000 in unpaid fees.

...Since then....
After a long period of soul searching, continuing to train and more than a little TLC from my amazing friends, I managed to pay off what I owed to the NCCA, and gather myself together to look towards returning.
It would be easy to see this year out as wasted time, but I have tried to see it as an important development, both personally and professionally: I have learned flying trapeze, aerial cradle and straps, taught Tightwire, co-directed an ensemble circus show, and, for the first time ever, done more work in circus than in any other art form. 
It has been a hard but fruitful year, and after a successful re-audition, the NCCA have allowed me to return to the degree programme this September!



About The National Centre for Circus Arts 
The tuition fees for the NCCA are set at £9000 per year.
This is on-par with the most prestigious degrees in Dance, Drama, Music and Fine Art available in the UK at the moment. It is a large amount of money, but it has every right to be, as this is one of the most demanding and selective of courses, and is accredited by the London Conservatoire for Dance and Drama. 
The programme is very physically intensive, and classes are full time Monday to Friday, with some of the best teachers in the industry. Former graduates have gone on work internationally, to found their own award winning companies. and to work for Cirque du Soleil!

Money!When I left the NCCA in June 2014 I owed them over £6000 in unpaid fees. After a great deal of hard work (and an amazing first Crowdfunding campaign!) I was able to pay them back, and even managed to raise the first instalment of tuition fees needed to return this September (2015). 
This Campaign is to raise the last £3000 I need to complete the Second year of training and gain my Foundation Degree in Circus Arts!



The Perks
The world of 'The Circus' can seem like an almost mystical place, far removed from the majority of people's lives. The Perks I have on offer for this campaign show something of what it is I do, allow people to experience some of the magic of the modern Circus, and see first-hand how their donations are helping me to progress. 
I am so very humbled by any and all donations that people choose to make, and I am hoping to deliver many of the Perks as shortly after the campaign ends as possible, though some, such as ""Starter for Ten"", ""Circus - Live!"" and  ""Circus VIP"" will take a little longer to deliver.
 
The Impact
By donating, you will be helping me to return to my place on the Foundation Degree at the National Centre for Circus Arts, and train at one of the most prestigious schools in the world. I will not only be learning some of the best circus technique, but will also be given classes in dance, theatre, performance and production planning. 
These skills will not only help me to develop as an individual, but also give me the opportunity to make a contribute to the wider performing arts industry. After graduating I am intending to make my own work, and also help support the work and developments of others, and pass on the unique skills I have gained to the next generation artists. 
I believe that circus is elemental, astounding and sincere, because it uses as its medium the one thing that we all still share and have in common: the human body, with all of its incredible potential, and devastating vulnerability. 
I hope that people have enjoyed the work I've made so far, and dare to hope they may be interested to see what I could do in the future if I reach my goal.

school’s inability to meet the required standards. Since then the over 100 students have been
forced to either stay at home or receive substandard education elsewhere within

University of Pennsylvania studying to obtain my Bachelor of Science in biology.
I have always had an affinity for animals, primarily lions, and realized at a
young age that I wanted nothing more than to work with them. I am currently
trying to raise money for my dream internship in Africa that will not only
better my education and help me gain a fuller understanding of my line of work,
but also prepare me to enter the field as soon as I graduate. This internship
is one of the best out there and will help me be extremely marketable in such a
competitive field. However, before I can achieve this dream I have to ask for
help. In order to attend this internship, I will be required to provide
approximately $9,000. This will be one of my biggest obstacles to overcome,
though it is not one that I am willing to let stand in the way of my dreams. Before
I ask for any donations, I would like to tell you about the trip I will be
taking.</p>
<p>For six months I will be stationed in an African Savannah on
a very secluded base where I will spend my first three months studying under a
mentor and attending lectures on what being a conservationist entails. For my
final three months, I will be considered an unpaid staff member and will be assisting
in the training of volunteers. I will also be given my own projects to undertake.
My duties will include a wide range of experiences, from analyzing paper data
to being meters from a live lion and noting down observations on their mannerisms.</p>
<p>I am asking that you graciously help me raise money so that
I can receive this training, which is a true once-in-a-lifetime experience. Helping
me raise money does not require your donation, though that would be highly
appreciated, but can also involve spreading word. I have a long way to go
before I can achieve this goal, and it is not something I can do myself. Please
help me by donating anything as little as $5 and/or passing on to your friends,
family, and coworkers what I am trying to accomplish and the goals I have set. I
can make a huge difference in the world, and I will. This internship gives me
the ability to do so, as does your gratuity.</p>

6/6: Fuse!box does a little fantrucking - if that's even possible - after a shout out from one of our favorite makers, Mythbuster Adam Savage!
6/5: Fuse!box is featured by SparkTruck, one of our biggest inspirations for the mobile hackerspace concept. Woot!
6/3: We're on the MIT Admissions blog, thanks to the awesome Allan Ko.
5/18: Fuse!box is featured by Ayah Bdeir, founder of LittleBits! Thanks for the shoutout, Ayah!

5/17 and 5/18: Fuse!box takes on the Bay Area MakerFaire! We had a fantastic time in the MakerShed manning an enormous LED sign, learning what everyone would build (if they could build anything), and spreading the word about mobile hackerspaces! Check out our photos from MakerFaire in the gallery.

His practice is steeped in sustainable educational models from cross-cultural philosophies, and his main focus is helping students uncover the learning process using creative and critical problem-solving skills. Motivated in developing a holistic perspective through continuous education and the evolution of quality interpersonal engagement, Zach values exploration, communication, and reflection.As the directors of Conscious Pursuits, we are committed to shifting the paradigm of education into an ecologically sound system allowing children and young adults to thrive.Our campaign is focused on providing one-year tuition scholarships for two students attending GROW, a supportive educational life-skills opportunity with a private residential experience. This opportunity is for young women ages 18-24 who are seeking support as they build sustainable, self-sufficient lifescapes.As a contributor to this project, you will be extending this educational opportunity to young-women who do not have the financial support or independence to afford tuition. You will be providing two students the opportunity to learn, heal, and grow, in a supportive environment that promotes whole-person education.What We Need & What You GetThis campaign will provide one-year tuition for two students. At $42,000, Conscious Pursuits will be able to provide two students with the following opportunity: room and board, case-management, 24-hour a day on-call crisis management, and an individualized need-specific curriculum in life skills.Contributors of $100 or more will receive Pursue Consciously MT logo wear designed by the student you support.If this campaign does not reach its intended goal, all funds collected will be used solely for tuition scholarships awarded to students attending opportunities with Conscious Pursuits. Serving a wide demographic of students between the ages of 4-24, Conscious Pursuits provides various plans, representing various tuition costs. Regardless of how much money is raised, all money will go towards student tuition scholarships.The Impact
GROW by Conscious
Pursuits impacts transitional and at risk young adults, and aims to
offer participants a diverse community experience based on acceptance,
cooperation, and empathy. Today one in four students age 18-25 report feelings of hopelessness and depression. Donations support promising young adults who are of bright
intelligence with average to superior IQ, and a desire to succeed as
individuals contributing to their communities so that all thrive harmoniously. Many are artistic,
highly personable, and struggled to learn in traditional, academic settings. These young adults may have gaps in
education. The Growth Process helps them master
their own learning style, and explore their goals and ambitions. Many share
similar experiences and are between the ages of 18-24. Some may
have fallen behind, perhaps due to failure of school, drug and alcohol use,
mental health problems, identity issues, body image issues, breakup, loss, or
trauma. Their unfolding was interrupted somewhere along their
developmental path. Our applicants frequently need help as they have no primary support system in place. With your donation young person who would otherwise be at risk for homelessness and morbidity can know success with commitment and effort in GROW’s Life skills
classroom and safe, respectful, non-institutional, private residence.

<p>  My name is Rod Cummings and I am Founder of LinkedUpLearning. From an early age I was passionate about mathematics; but soon discovered that not everyone enjoyed it. I found myself teaching my fellow students who struggled with their math exercises.</p>
<p>  In the 90's I developed a unique way to address the dread of mathematics by developing a system that helped people learn in a fun and progressive manner.  With my systems and programs in place, I began teaching extracurricular maths in labs using computers.</p>
<p>  Eventually, I developed a board game based around a student’s grasp of math fundamentals.

What gave me even more satisfaction was that it made math fun and allowed players to discover the same love of the subject that I have.</p>
<p>  Ultimately, over 25,000 of these board games were sold to schools, proving effective with outstanding math learning results for its players.</p>
<p>  We also have a team who are dedicated to enhancing education, some holding masters degrees in mathematics and computer science.  All are experienced developers. We studied the physiology and concepts of mathematics, culminating in the development of unique mathematics courseware engines. We have the experience of teaching 3,000+ students and teachers using this mathematics courseware via the Internet, combined with owning and operating mathematical teaching laboratories.  This is LinkedUpLearning, the team behind Monster Math.</p>

<p>Beyond the Bell
offers a safe alternative for school age students who might otherwise be left
at home unsupervised during the day. Our program offers after school services
for children from 5 years to 12 years of age. Summer and holiday camps are also
available. </p>
<p>Beyond the Bell
will serve multiple purposes. Firstly, Beyond the Bell provides an innovative
approach to after school care as the founders and owners are both certified
Elementary and Special Education school teachers who are able to provide
exceptional learning opportunities during the program’s “Bright Hour.”
Our program provides enrichment activities that meet the developmental needs
and interests of children. In addition, Beyond the Bell will collaborate with schools in order to provide students with supplemental enrichment
activities based on the standards in which teachers are focusing. </p>
<p>Implementing Beyond the Bell will have a direct impact that will assist in creating lifelong
learners through the following enrichment activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational
     enrichment opportunities</li>
<li>Team
     building activities</li>
<li>Critical
     thinking advancement </li>
<li>Social
     skill development</li>
<li>Community
     involvement</li>
<li>Health
     and fitness development</li>
</ul><p>Indirectly, the implementation of Beyond the Bell is
expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase
     homework completion</li>
<li>Improve
     attendance and test scores</li>
<li>Decrease
     behavior difficulties</li>
<li>Instill
     a love of learning and create a sense of belonging</li>
<li>Increase
     health, wellness and fitness</li>
<li>Potentially
     decrease juvenile crime</li>
</ul><p>Beyond the Bell
will be a positive and beneficial addition for schools and students. Our
program will provide a school-based environment where extended academic and
social learning is the norm.  Thank you
very much for your time in reading this and Beyond the Bell is looking forward to making
a change in the lives of youth across Arizona. </p>
<br/><span><span><span></span></span></span><p>The funding received will help our program acquire the materials needed to provide our students with various enrichment activities in the areas of music, science, technology, mathematics, art/fine art, health, fitness, team building, social skills, language, community and literature.

offers a safe alternative for school age students who might otherwise be left
at home unsupervised during the day. Our program offers after school services
for children from 5 years to 12 years of age. Summer and holiday camps are also
available. 
Beyond the Bell
will serve multiple purposes. Firstly, Beyond the Bell provides an innovative
approach to after school care as the founders and owners are both certified
Elementary and Special Education school teachers who are able to provide
exceptional learning opportunities during the program’s “Bright Hour.”
Our program provides enrichment activities that meet the developmental needs
and interests of children. In addition, Beyond the Bell will collaborate with schools in order to provide students with supplemental enrichment
activities based on the standards in which teachers are focusing. 
Implementing Beyond the Bell will have a direct impact that will assist in creating lifelong
learners through the following enrichment activities:

Educational
     enrichment opportunities
Team
     building activities
Critical
     thinking advancement 
Social
     skill development
Community
     involvement
Health
     and fitness development
Indirectly, the implementation of Beyond the Bell is
expected to:

Increase
     homework completion
Improve
     attendance and test scores
Decrease
     behavior difficulties
Instill
     a love of learning and create a sense of belonging
Increase
     health, wellness and fitness
Potentially
     decrease juvenile crime
Beyond the Bell
will be a positive and beneficial addition for schools and students. Our
program will provide a school-based environment where extended academic and
social learning is the norm.  Thank you
very much for your time in reading this and Beyond the Bell is looking forward to making
a change in the lives of youth across Arizona. 
The funding received will help our program acquire the materials needed to provide our students with various enrichment activities in the areas of music, science, technology, mathematics, art/fine art, health, fitness, team building, social skills, language, community and literature. Furthermore, donations will also be used to allow students to participate in field trips and various community activities. For example, Beyond the Bell will contract guest speakers to both educate and entertain our students.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>I'm a 24 yr old North Carolina native. Howard University Alumna (Business Admin/Marketing Major). I now currently reside in the big NYC working for advertising agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather! (big change from the little town in North Carolina, but I'm loving it). I have been very blessed to make it to where I am today. I know that this was only accomplished because of the wonderful people that have surrounded me throughout my life. I realize now <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">it is time I pay it forward. </span><span style=""""></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I've always adored working with children, helping whether it was through coaching little league teams, tutoring, babysitting, or being a mentor in different community programs. Now I'm ready to go bigger and do more! Leaving my comfortable confines of the US to reach out where I can have a large impact. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have been afforded an amazing opportunity to volunteer with the Shanti 
Bhavan Children's Project in India. In August, I'm off to a small, rural
 village in India where I will be teaching intelligent yet underprivileged students! 
 </p>I will be in a small village two hours south of Bangalore, for 2.5 months I'll be aiding the Indian teachers and leading my own classes. The students range from age 4 to Seniors in High School. There I will be helping in which ever subjects need my help: math, science, arts/crafts, dance, &amp; possibly some business/economic classes.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Shanti Bhavan, also know as ""Haven of Peace"", is a home and a boarding school to some of the most underprivileged children in India. They are children of the Dalit caste, the ""Untouchables"".</p>
<p>Shanti provides a space for the children to live, learn and develop using a completely unique and innovative
        model of combating poverty, educating the poor and fighting social
        injustice.  Admitting students at the age of four, Shanti Bhavan
        provides a holistic, high quality education until the age of 17 free of
        cost, and subsequently funds college education for its students.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Without Shanti Bhavan, many of these students may not have ever received an adequate education ...much less the opportunities or options placed in front of them to make a brighter future for themselves, their family and often their community.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Shanti Bhavan's children see that a better world isn’t  just an idea but a real possibility.                  Turning them into adults who will now have the power to contribute to a better world.</p>

The project begins at the 2014 NAJA conference in Santa Clara, California. Students arrive early for a three-day series of sessions on the nuts and bolts of journalism.

NAJA-NI students get further training at the College Media Association’s multimedia workshops on the Vanderbilt campus, July 29 - Aug. 1.

In order for design to be an effective tool for the progress of society, it must be <b>inclusive</b>, incorporating the visions and voices of people from varying walks of life.</p><p>Design thinking is <b>empowering</b>. It encourages <b>creative thought</b> and <b>progressive solutions</b>. It allows individuals <b>agency</b> in their lives and develops important mental capabilities for <b>problem-solving</b>. Free design education provides those who lack the  resources to pursue costly studies with the <b>tools</b> required to remain in step with the advancement of society and helps ensure a diversified roster of voices in the industry, promoting a more <b>heterogeneously designed world</b>.</p><p>The intention behind CSB is to strive to <b>make the design world accessible</b> to young people with talent, flair and the driving impulse to create. Considering the high costs of tuition at design institutions, the cost of the supplies required to carry out an education and pursue a career, and the impenetrability of the design industry, it is impossible for many aspiring designers from marginalised communities to pursue their talent. Currently design education and access to the design world are reserved for those who can afford to get a foot in. Because wealth and aptitude do not necessarily come hand in hand, the world is therefore missing out on plenty of untapped talent. CSB provides a system that <b>fosters the talent of those who might otherwise be left unnoticed.</b></p><p><b>                               </b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430991393/ta2fusngvdzauuexqab8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><blockquote style=""text-align: right;"">A first year student's sketches </blockquote><div>

</h3></b><p>In the future, CSB aims to become a self sustainable entity.</p><p>Currently, we persist largely through student based scholarships from generous individuals who believe in our cause. The generosity of these individuals is crucial to us.</p><p>However, as not all of our students are covered by scholarships, we have developed a rigorous fundraising strategy that helps us cover the remainder of our yearly costs.</p><p><b>Events</b> - We host quarterly fundraising events in collaboration with various venues in Beirut.  </p><br/><p><b>CSB Brand</b> - CSB has developed a brand under the same name including a ready to wear line and a product line, designed by the creative team. The ready to wear line includes one size fits all, casual and comfortable items will donate all profits to CSB's educational program.</p><br/><p><b>Exhibitions</b> - Each year, we collaborate with a different venue and host a public exhibition displaying the student’s collection. The students’ one of a kind designs are sold, and the proceeds generated are returned to the school.</p><h4><b><br/></b></h4><h4><b>HOW YOU CAN HELP </b></h4><div>
<p>As we continue to work towards self-sustainability, we need as much support as possible from those who believe in our cause and in the change that free creative education can bring about in people's lives and in our future.  The $25,000 we aim to raise through crowdfunding will sustain our organization until our November exhibition in Kuwait, our largest fundraising event of the year. Over the course of 5 months, these funds will cover student transportation, student supplies,  rent and utilities. Additionally, the money you help us raise will partially cover salaries, costs related to a visiting international instructor, and expenses related to our exhibition such as student flight tickets to Kuwait.  </p>
<p>To continue supporting the talent of these amazing students, we need your help! It is actually inspired by a very old way of doing things, artists have always had patrons.</p>
<p>In addition to being a collaborative, grassroots method of raising funds, crowdfunding is also another avenue through which to spread our message about the importance of free creative education. </p>
<p>Thank you and we hope that as pioneers of a better future, you will join us in paving the road towards equal opportunity! </p>

They are provided with a well-rounded curriculum, exposure into the design world, supplies and transportation entirely free of charge.Our long term goal is to expand into a multifaceted and progressive institution that provides free quality education in various fields of creative design.THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESSIBLE DESIGN EDUCATIONDesign is a process used to shape and structure our world; the clothes we wear, the buildings we live and work in and the products we use. In order for design to be an effective tool for the progress of society, it must be inclusive, incorporating the visions and voices of people from varying walks of life.Design thinking is empowering. It encourages creative thought and progressive solutions. It allows individuals agency in their lives and develops important mental capabilities for problem-solving. Free design education provides those who lack the  resources to pursue costly studies with the tools required to remain in step with the advancement of society and helps ensure a diversified roster of voices in the industry, promoting a more heterogeneously designed world.The intention behind CSB is to strive to make the design world accessible to young people with talent, flair and the driving impulse to create. Considering the high costs of tuition at design institutions, the cost of the supplies required to carry out an education and pursue a career, and the impenetrability of the design industry, it is impossible for many aspiring designers from marginalised communities to pursue their talent. Currently design education and access to the design world are reserved for those who can afford to get a foot in. Because wealth and aptitude do not necessarily come hand in hand, the world is therefore missing out on plenty of untapped talent. CSB provides a system that fosters the talent of those who might otherwise be left unnoticed.                               A first year student's sketches 
HOW IT ALL BEGAN
With these notions in mind, Sarah Hermez and her former professor, design guru Caroline Simonelli, founded Creative Space Beirut in 2011.In 2009, Sarah graduated with a dual degree in Fashion Design from Parsons the New School for Design and Media and Culture studies from Eugene Lang the New School for Liberal Arts. Disillusioned by the corporate face of fashion, she resolved to make positive use of her privileged education and to take steps towards reforming the nature of the industry.  The idea began brewing over a cup of coffee with Caroline at Dean and Deluca during a visit to New York, a year after Sarah had graduated. As they sat sorting through schemes for merging Sarah's seemingly irreconcilable passions of fashion design and social justice, Caroline suddenly asked 'why don't you start a free school?'There, the seed was planted. Sarah returned to her native Lebanon and with a burst of energy and conviction she began drafting plans, conducting research and garnering support.  Through visits to refugee camps, women's centres, marginalised neighbourhoods and NGOs Sarah found five young aspiring designers from various backgrounds who were passionate and courageous enough to begin this journey with her.Caroline and Sarah guiding the students during the first days of Creative Space BeirutIn June 2011, Caroline flew in from New York with $100,000 worth of quality fabric donated by designers Donna Karan, Derek Lam and Diane von Furstenberg. Together they set out on an experiment that was to set the precedent for Creative Space Beirut. Within three months, 30 one-of-a-kind pieces were designed and executed by the students and an exhibition was curated and held at Saifi Urban Gardens in August. Every piece was sold, raising over 20,0000 to help fund the next term!The moral support of the public, the success of the exhibition, and the students' energy, dedication and raw talent confirmed Sarah's belief in the importance of free education and provided the impetus and motivation to soldier on to the next step.Members of the public admire student pieces at pilot project exhibition, Saifi Urban Gardens, August 2011Cofounders' BiographiesSarah Hermez is a Lebanese fashion designer, born and raised in Kuwait.

(To see some of the student designs, please go to the gallery page here or on our website!)After completing the three year program, students will have gained a quality design education and compiled a comprehensive portfolio, and are assisted in locating career opportunities through CSB's endorsement and network.COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTIn accordance with our values of collaboration, we strive to play a role in the community through taking part in conferences, festivals, and other events with like-minded individuals. We have been an active part of Beirut Design Week for two years, and plan on continuing to do so in order to maintain dialogue with the local and international design community. Our founder Sarah also gave talks and took part in various conferences, including TEDxBeirut, the Nuqat Conference in Kuwait, and ING Creatives Conference in Dubai. It is important for us to spread our message, and to become involved in the dynamic discourse of responsible design, free education, and equal opportunity.  CSB founder Sarah Hermez gives a talk at TEDxBeirut 





OUR STUDENTS

Our students come from diverse backgrounds and commute to CSB from all corners of Lebanon, including Palestinian refugee camps, Saida and Bourj Hammoud. Our students do not have the means to pursue an education or career in fashion design; however, they share a talent and aptitude for design and demonstrate a commitment to hard work. CSB offers these talented young individuals a unique opportunity into design education as well as the design industry. In a country fraught by sectarian tension, with 18 different religious sects, CSB offers a haven of mutual acceptance and understanding that promotes equality and diversity through creative education. Our students form strong friendships, break religious, social and economic barriers, build bridges across communities, and find constructive common ground in their passion for design.
      CSB students help each other with a pattern making assignmentAline joined the Creative Space Beirut team in November 2013. She quickly proved her dedication, impressing her mentors with her work ethic and quick learning. Within the first month, Aline's technical prowess was evident. She has surpassed expectations on every technique she's come across, excelling in precision and cleanliness. Aline works slowly and carefully, ensuring that each stitch is perfect. We are confident in Aline's capability to become a strong, expert designer and look forward to supporting her coming accomplishments. Ahmad's fascination with fashion began with a penchant for illustration at the tender age of three, when he would draw his mother's dresses and outfits and make clothes for dolls. Though his parents encouraged his talent, they could not afford to pay for an education in fashion design or for the supplies and materials required for the degree. Ahmad joined CSB this year and has already impressed his peers and mentors with his talent for illustration. Through an enriching education, we have no doubt he can be well on his way to becoming an accomplished designer. 

Dana grew up making clothes for her dolls out of napkins, scrap fabric and household items. Her drive to become a fashion designer grew when she saw Lebanese designers such as Elie Saab and Zouheir Mourad rise to worldwide success. Her family could not afford any of the costly fashion design programs that are offered in Lebanon. Dana joined CSB this year and we are excited to see what she will make of her quirky aesthetics and enthusiasm for design. 


Fatima taught herself to sew and worked under a tailor for three months before she realised that it didn't allow for much creativity or growth. Set on learning to design, she joined CSB in February 2013 and has since displayed rapid development and incomparable work ethic, Fatima takes naturally to intricate and detail-oriented techniques such as embroidery and material work, which entails forming added textures onto fabric. Her paced, dexterous and determined method of design is apparent in her refined pieces, which speak for a careful and studied aspiring fashion designer. Hazem's passion for fashion was born in childhood, when he would insist on styling his mother, delighting in choosing her outfits for different occasions. Although his parents supported his penchant for design, his mother insisted on his entering Lebanese International University through government aid. A dedicated worker with big dreams, Hazem will continue his degree in business while also pursuing his ambition of becoming a fashion designer here at CSB. Heba joined CSB in November 2013. She had never designed before, but her talent was evident in her sketches. In the past year, Heba has continued to develop and to impress us with her ability to integrate her fertile imagination into her designs. Seamlessly weaving the conceptual and the technical, Heba's modern pieces reflect forward thinking as she designs with both function and beauty in mind. She works hard to strengthen her technique, as she challenges herself to push towards the frontiers of conceptual design. Marie reached out to CSB through the Kfarhay branch of SOS Village d'Enfants, the relief organisation whose care she has been under since becoming orphaned under unknown circumstances at the age of 2. Marie is our youngest student and has been interested in fashion design for as long as she can remember. She takes pleasure in altering her own clothes, snipping and sewing her jeans, tops, skirts and dresses to create new designs. Inspired by her determination and enthusiasm we welcomed her to the team this year. Nour became interested in CSB after she saw our 'Make Designers Not Clothes'  slogan in graffiti on walls around the city. It struck a chord with her and she sought us out. When she came in for her initial interview, Nour brought with her an array of unique and crafty sculptures and pieces of jewellery, as well as a thick portfolio of drawings and sketches. Undoubtedly in possession of a creative mind and skilled hands, we welcomed her into CSB in November 2013. Nour's designs are intricate and eclectic, integrating techniques such as macramé and knotting into her pieces. A passionate colour enthusiast, Rola has always experimented in working with her hands, employing several artistic crafts. She joined the Creative Space Beirut in February 2013 after attending a local institute for design. Since then, she has strengthened her skills and is always surprising us with her creativity. Rola designs off the beaten track, experimenting with patchwork and creating her own fabrics. Last year, she received 2nd place in a national design competition and won a prize to attend Paris Fashion Week! Rola will be producing her own collection and graduating this year. Rony grew up dreaming to be a fashion designer, making clothes out of household items, sketching and researching fashion trends on his own. In his time at the Creative Space Beirut since February 2013, Rony has come a very long way. A quick learner and a natural leader, Rony has not only designed a number of popular pieces, but also assists his fellow student designers with pattern making. Last year, Rony won first place in a national fashion design competition in which four other design schools participated. As a prize, he was sent to Milan to participate in a workshop at the prestigious academy, NABA. We have very high hopes for Rony, who continues to develop as a designer, challenging himself and excelling at each endeavour he tackles.

FUNDRAISING STRATEGY
In the future, CSB aims to become a self sustainable entity.Currently, we persist largely through student based scholarships from generous individuals who believe in our cause. The generosity of these individuals is crucial to us.However, as not all of our students are covered by scholarships, we have developed a rigorous fundraising strategy that helps us cover the remainder of our yearly costs.Events - We host quarterly fundraising events in collaboration with various venues in Beirut.  CSB Brand - CSB has developed a brand under the same name including a ready to wear line and a product line, designed by the creative team. The ready to wear line includes one size fits all, casual and comfortable items will donate all profits to CSB's educational program.Exhibitions - Each year, we collaborate with a different venue and host a public exhibition displaying the student’s collection. The students’ one of a kind designs are sold, and the proceeds generated are returned to the school.HOW YOU CAN HELP 
As we continue to work towards self-sustainability, we need as much support as possible from those who believe in our cause and in the change that free creative education can bring about in people's lives and in our future.  The $25,000 we aim to raise through crowdfunding will sustain our organization until our November exhibition in Kuwait, our largest fundraising event of the year. Over the course of 5 months, these funds will cover student transportation, student supplies,  rent and utilities. Additionally, the money you help us raise will partially cover salaries, costs related to a visiting international instructor, and expenses related to our exhibition such as student flight tickets to Kuwait.  
To continue supporting the talent of these amazing students, we need your help! It is actually inspired by a very old way of doing things, artists have always had patrons.
In addition to being a collaborative, grassroots method of raising funds, crowdfunding is also another avenue through which to spread our message about the importance of free creative education. 
Thank you and we hope that as pioneers of a better future, you will join us in paving the road towards equal opportunity!",20.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>My name is Linda Lee and I am the writer, illustrator, narrator and animator of a brand new animated children's ebook call ""Serengeti Safari"". I am an independent animation artist that loves to watch and create cartoons. Just last year I created a public service announcement (PSA) about Japan's 2010 tsunami. The PSA was nominated for Best Commercial at the 2011 Burbank International Film Festival in Burbank, California, USA. </p>
<p><strong>Description and Importance of this campaign-</strong></p>
<p>The format of my animated ebook will look like a short film except it will have text on the pictures, narration, limited animation and the best part is that it will look like one of Disneyland's slow motion roller coaster rides. The ebook for now can be view only on the web. If it's a success I will upgrade the ebook to mobile apps.</p>
<p>The main reason for this campaign is to raise money to publish my animated children's ebook. I also would like to create animated contents that are fun and educational at the same time. No matter what age you are today, we've all got our knowledge from text books, magazines, fiction and non- fiction books. I still think paper copy books are great, but I would like to change that a little bit so that children of this and later generations can have more fun while reading.</p>
<p>Another important thing about this campaign is that if I have extra funds from this campaign. I want to give 10% of the extra funds  to LA Zoo. I like to draw the animals at LA Zoo and I have also seen how happy children of any age are when they go to the zoo to see animals that they don't usually see in their daily lives.</p>
<p><strong>What I need and what you get for your contributions-</strong></p>
<p>For your contributions you will also get the perks listed in the list of perks. Just to name a couple of these perks if you contribute $10 or more you will get a 3x5 hand illustrated Thank you card from me the author and if you contribute $25 or more you will get your name listed in the credits' page at the end of the ebook as well as a signed DVD copy of the ebook.</p>
<p>I am very passionate about animation, but this campaign is not only about my passion. It's about how I can create jobs for artistic people like me, helping children learn and hopefully protect the animals world wide from extinction. This campaign is also about helping LA Zoo become a better and safer place for animals to live in.</p>
<p><strong>Please help with either money donations or simply just spreading the word about this campaign Thank you.</strong></p>

<p>As I approach my senior year, with graduation quickly approaching behind it, in this economy an internship is a key necessity to enter any field successfully, or in hopes of having the upper-hand when it comes to Graduate School applications, so that is why I created this site! I was recently accepted into Jefferson's Monticello Archaeology Field School, this program is offered through the University of Virginia, which is a top 20 University in the U.S. currently. </p>
<p>History is an ever changing and ever expanding field, the study of the past, is in turn the study of the future as well. The pattern which societies, rulers, regimes, countries, cities, villages all go through can be seen as a repeating occurence throughout the massive timeline of history! By supporting my internship, you will be actively supporting the future of American history and the active desire to discover more about one of America's greatest founder fathers, Thomas Jefferson!! How could you say no?! Jefferson was a very private man, he kept to himself and there is still so much that modern historians have to discover about him, and the way he lived during his time at Monticello- I want to be a part of this once in a lifetime opportunity more than words could begin to express. This is your chance to help!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Tuition for the program is $2,325 and includes housing expenses with the University, wonderful academic guest lectures from some of the best professors in their fields currently, and all the experience which I would gain in learning more about the field which I love! The program is, of course in Virginia, and I am from Nebraska, which is why my goal amount is higher than just the tuition cost, so that I am able to have the travel expense I will need in order to get from here to there. </p>
<p>My passion for history can only be explained by telling you that I, Kaitlin, am a true history nerd. My favorite part of the history classes I get to take at NWU are the research papers. There is nothing I love more than packing my backpack for a full day of research at my university's library. I love discovering the story behind the story! Discovering all the different accounts of one event, reading about a person from history (like Jefferson) from a book, for me makes that person come alive. My imagination begins to reconstruct everything that person had experience and my mind easily runs through the different angles of how I, as a historian can best approach the topic which I am researching or studying. </p>
<p>If I end up not reaching my goal to get the amount to pay for this wonderful internship entirely, I will still use any and all funds to pay for the program and my supplies, such as cargo pants (necessary for woodland field work), hand tools needed, travel expenses, and books for the actual course research section of the program. Any and all help is very gratefully appreciated beyond words!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Believe me, with the way the current economy is going I understand that some people who may really want to contribute, just can't afford to financially right now. If you are one of those people who believe in this internship as much as I do, please spread the word to your co-workers, your boss, maybe a local philanthropist you know who does a lot for young scholars, or history, or anything similar, and please direct them to my page so that they can read and learn all about this fantastic chance to help one history major nerd's dreams come true!</p>
<p>If you would like to share this page, Indiegogo does have a ""share"" option link you can click in order to send it on to others, if you believe that you know someone who might  be interested in supporting my travels to Monticello, please share this with them. </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read all about this wonderful internship opportunity I have been offered and I hope you decide to donate any amount you can spare. It will be greatly appreciated!</p>

Hello, my name is Pamela Marquis. Three years ago, I came home to
New Orleans with a brand new Masters of Social Work in hand and a deep desire
to make a positive difference in this charming yet challenged city. 
 
I
recently started the non-profit organization, Shine A Light Louisiana. Our first program is

express their feelings.
 
The
pilot program will connect the youth with professional artists: a spoken word
artist, who will help them talk about their incarceration and create a
poem/rap. Next, a visual artist will help them create images to complement
their poems; then a drummer will come in to help them add the beat.  Our
artists include: Luther Gray with Bamboula 2000, Chris Clark and Kataalyst
Alcindor.
 
Professional
journalists will also write strength profiles of each youth that will highlight
his/her dreams, goals and successes. Each youth will also have a portrait taken
by Thom Bennett, an award-winning photographer.
 
The
finished project is professionally designed profiles on the youth and a video
shot by the youth that includes the final performances of their work and
interviews of the youth, by the youth, about their experience.





The Impact

Research shows
time spent in confinement can increase the odds of negative adult outcomes for
youth by jump-starting a spiral of failure that often becomes impossible to
escape. Far too often, incarceration serves as a trip wire for long-term
criminal involvement and future failure.
We know this is a critical time. Youth
need the tools to help them articulate their fears, express their feelings and
begin the dialogue they desperately need to begin. Will they choose to change
their lives and how will they choose to do it? 
Certainly
their lives are complicated, and one thing will not provide the quick and final
fix, but we believe, and the research supports the claim, that the arts can be
tremendously helpful in changing lives in positive ways.  
Youth
can begin to express themselves through the arts thus gaining a deeper
understanding of the issues contributing to their crime and delinquency. The
arts also provide rich opportunities for personal growth. 
And if that weren't
reason enough--research proves that offering arts programs significantly
reduces violent incidents within the facility.


What We Need & What You Get


The $2000 will pay all the expenses
of this two-week program. It will pay the professional artists, which include a
spoken word artist, visual artist, drummer, photographer, videographer, editor and a
graphic design artist. It will also allow us to purchase art and video
supplies and offer a stipend to a program director.

 This program already has great support and a number of people who
want it to succeed. I am hoping this platform will make it easy for everyone
who wants to be a part of this program to help the program take flight. This is our first step to offering this program on an ongoing basis at Y.S.C. and facilitating it at other institutions. 


$4 FOR THE FUTURE
If every one of my Facebook friends gave just $4.00, we'd make our
goal. I certainly know money is tight; most of my friends are artists or social
workers. But $4.00 that's a cappuccino, a Big Mac or a glass of house wine. You can give $4 for the Future!
I truly believe in this project and the good that it will do.


Getting
this project off the ground while doing our evaluation along the way will
position us to turn this into an ongoing program that I know will have a
positive impact on these youth.  

If
you itemize deductions on your tax return, we will send you the necessary
paperwork. Just mention you need it and we will get your address and send a

<p><em>“By participating in the Show Me Costa Rica project, I see an opportunity to break the cycle in my family, giving me the chance to travel internationally, experience a different culture, study foreign ways of life, and strengthen my educational background.” – Septisha Riley, Show Me Costa Rica Participant </em></p>
<p>The<strong> Show Me Costa Rica project </strong>aims to provide an international learning experience focused on biology-related excursions for twelve students.  Students enrolled in highest-need schools often have limited opportunities to reach beyond their situations. Despite this reality, our students have a once in a lifetime opportunity to step out of their comfort zone and challenge themselves to expand their worldview as a participant of this special project. <strong>Show Me Costa Rica</strong> offers students the opportunity to explore beyond their own community by gaining cross-cultural immersion and understanding. Additionally, students will study different forms of life first-hand that cannot be found in the United States. For a group of determined students, it is hard to imagine a more exciting opportunity to engage in experiential learning while developing a deeper understanding of themselves and their goals in an international landscape. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Students</strong></p>
<p><span>The participants of </span><span>Show Me Costa Rica </span><span>include sophomores, juniors, and seniors in inner city St. Louis with big dreams who are limited with a lack of financial resources. Participant Brionne Harris writes, “My </span><span>goal is to become a pediatric nurse...my job description will involve interacting with many people of different backgrounds and origins – I will gain exposure to people of a new culture and an extraordinary biology learning opportunity that will give me a meaningful experience to help prepare me for my future.” </span></p>
<p><span>Please read the attached brochure to find out more information about the dreams and goals of each student!</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>The Fundraising Goal</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Projected Costs: $2,300 per student. </strong>Please help us raise<strong> $10,000 </strong>toward our total trip goal of $27,600!</p>
<p>We have an extensive fundraising plan and we would like to raise $10,000 of the total money through IndieGoGo. The $2,300 per student includes: Round trip flights (coach), three meals a day (does not include soda/dessert), on-tour transportation, full time tour director, all-inclusive insurance (lost bags/delayed flights), eight overnight stays in budget hotels, comprehensive sightseeing of natural attractions, entrance to Tortuguero canals boat ride, hot springs, Lake Arenal kayaking, La Fortuna Waterfall, and Rincon de la Vieja National Park.</p>
<p>The participants of <strong>Show Me Costa Rica </strong>are intelligent and hardworking student leaders who attend Vashon High School. The students were selected through an application and interview process. Based on their environment and social circumstances, these students are what the society considers<strong> “at-risk” – at-risk</strong> of having babies as teenagers; <strong>at-risk</strong> of never finishing high school or achieving their dreams; <strong>at-risk</strong> of never knowing the world beyond their neighborhood. We beg to differ! These twelve students are<strong> “at-promise” – at-promise </strong>of overcoming obstacles and achieving their dreams; <strong>at-promise </strong>to become the first in their families to graduate from college; <strong>at-promise </strong>for expanding their worldview beyond their neighborhood.</p>

runs a coolant through carbon fiber tubes. Cool panels  give you more electricity and collect
heat to give you hot water. It <span><span>is
not grid tied so you don't need utility approval. If you add battery storage of
electricity, you can save electricity when the sun is not shining. Better, you
can save the day when natural disaster strikes. Think Super Storm Sandy! <br/><br/></span></span>
<p>The
Lotus Awning is beautiful and economical, easy to install, and requires no
expensive rooftop improvements.  <span><span>The US government
gives you a 30% tax credit and your utility company may give you a hot water
rebate. In Arizona, you have an additional 25% tax credit for up to $1000. For
a 6 panel system, your out of pocket cost can be as low as $1000 for about 2KW
of electricity plus another 2KW of heat for hot water. Solar Awning pays for
itself in less than three years!</span></span></p><p><span><span></span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/909389/files/20141006173554-Solar_Awning.jpg?1412642154"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

do we want to build a Solar Wonderland? First, to meet your demand for our carbon fiber panels, we are designing a low cost Giga-factory to build these panels. Second, the factory is going to create
jobs, hundreds in manufacturing and thousands in the installation and services
supported. Third, the energy amusement park can teach our
students about the Physics of energy. Fourth, you can also donate solar panels to US veterans so that they can enjoy free solar electricity and hot water. <p></p><p></p><p><b><span>The Circle of Energy and the Lotus Beer Garden at SkySong:</span></b></p>

</p><p>
</p>
<p><span><span><span>We
also plan to open an exhibit called the Circle of Energy by early next year.
The exhibit hall covers a floor space of 4000 square feet. There you enjoy a 3D video called ""What's the Matter

<br/><p></p><span><span><span>After
the 15 minute video, you can wander through 10 holographic stations, where
Solar Man explains 10 forms of energy including the 5 forces of nature: Electric, Magnetic, Gravitation, Weak and Strong, as well as the 5 other kinds of energy we experience: Motion, Heat, Pressure, Chemical, and Light. <br/><br/></span></span></span><p><span><span><span>Behind each multimedia holographic display, we have hands
on experiments to illustrate how one kind of

the Solar Man Grill. You can also have a cool beer and hot solar cooked food at our
Lotus Beer Garden, a 2000 square foot indoor and outdoor space that features
our products the Lotus Mobile, Lotus Heat, Lotus Max, Lotus Ice, and the Lotus
Water Chair.</span></span></span></p>

am Solar Man. My passion is to help people all over the world live a
comfortable yet sustainable life through the use of my inventions. I am introducing the Lotus Awning, a light weight carbon fiber composite solar panel that
runs a coolant through carbon fiber tubes. Cool panels  give you more electricity and collect
heat to give you hot water. It is
not grid tied so you don't need utility approval. If you add battery storage of
electricity, you can save electricity when the sun is not shining. Better, you
can save the day when natural disaster strikes. Think Super Storm Sandy! 
The
Lotus Awning is beautiful and economical, easy to install, and requires no
expensive rooftop improvements.  The US government
gives you a 30% tax credit and your utility company may give you a hot water
rebate. In Arizona, you have an additional 25% tax credit for up to $1000. For
a 6 panel system, your out of pocket cost can be as low as $1000 for about 2KW
of electricity plus another 2KW of heat for hot water. Solar Awning pays for
itself in less than three years!
We also produce a Lotus Survivor that gives you 100W of solar electricity and another 100W of solar hot water. Weighing only 5 pounds, don't leave home without the Lotus Survivor!
Let's Build the Solar Wonderland!
We
have a pent up demand for the Lotus Awning. We came up with
the idea of building a Solar Wonderland where solar panels are built besides an energy amusement park about solar power and the Physics of energy. 

Why
do we want to build a Solar Wonderland? First, to meet your demand for our carbon fiber panels, we are designing a low cost Giga-factory to build these panels. Second, the factory is going to create
jobs, hundreds in manufacturing and thousands in the installation and services
supported. Third, the energy amusement park can teach our
students about the Physics of energy. Fourth, you can also donate solar panels to US veterans so that they can enjoy free solar electricity and hot water. The Circle of Energy and the Lotus Beer Garden at SkySong:
We
start with building a 4000 square foot factory floor at SkySong, the head quarter of our company Monarch Power Corp. The factory can produce up to 20MW of solar panels
each year. We
plan to hire up to 20 people this year.  


We
also plan to open an exhibit called the Circle of Energy by early next year.
The exhibit hall covers a floor space of 4000 square feet. There you enjoy a 3D video called ""What's the Matter
with Energy?"" that explains solar power in terms of the relationship among
matter, energy, space and time; all in the context from the Big Bang till the
birth of our sun.
After
the 15 minute video, you can wander through 10 holographic stations, where
Solar Man explains 10 forms of energy including the 5 forces of nature: Electric, Magnetic, Gravitation, Weak and Strong, as well as the 5 other kinds of energy we experience: Motion, Heat, Pressure, Chemical, and Light. Behind each multimedia holographic display, we have hands
on experiments to illustrate how one kind of
energy can be converted into another kind of
energy. The Solar Wonderland has a shop for buying solar products, for example
the Solar Man Grill. You can also have a cool beer and hot solar cooked food at our
Lotus Beer Garden, a 2000 square foot indoor and outdoor space that features
our products the Lotus Mobile, Lotus Heat, Lotus Max, Lotus Ice, and the Lotus
Water Chair.
Solar
Wonderland at the Odyssey of the Desert: We are going to
lease a 5 plus acre land from the Pima native tribes to build a full size Solar
Wonderland. We have designed an 80 foot tall Solar Pyramid topped with a
Golden Sun made to rise by solar heated air. The ground floor is a 40,000
square foot factory that can house up to 6 production lines each with annual
production capacity of 200MW of solar panels. The production facility will hire
about 100 workers. The marketing, sales, installation, service, and applications of the Lotus line of products will create thousands of jobs.Connecting the parking structure to the plaza on the second floor of the pyramid is a ride
called ""Maglev Back to the Future"". Inside the pyramid, the second floor houses three
thrilling rides: ""Doctor Frankenstein in the Tesla Tower"",
""Alice in the Optics Wonderland"", and ""The Heat is On"". At the center of the second floor is a 3D theater showing the movie ""What's the Matter with Energy"". On top of the theater on the third floor is the Circle of Energy exhibit. The
third floor also is the launch pad of a free fall ride called
""Gravity"". 
The
40,000 square foot base of the Pyramid faces an 80,000 square foot Lotus Garden that
has a Lotus Pond, a Lotus Beer Garden, and an extra pay ride called
""Electric Car Grand Prix"". Surrounding the Lotus Garden is the Solar
Bazaar where renewable energy products are demonstrated and sold. 
Please Donate to
Build Solar Wonderland.
Your reward is great. You can prepay tickets for the ""Circle of Energy"" Exhibit or the Solar Wonderland.  You can buy our cool products that give you comfort and  save the
environment. You help create thousands of jobs. You help our students
understand solar power and energy. You can help US veterans with clean and abundant
solar power. You can also donate a solar panel with your name inscribed on the Solar Pyramid.

<p><i>Welcome to The Brooklyn Waldorf School’s 8th Grade Culmination Trip To Iceland Project.</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>Every year the graduating 8th grade class celebrates the conclusion of their elementary school years with a special trip that expresses the students’ educational and personal growth, and reflects upon specific topics covered in the curriculum. The trip is a springboard for deeper understanding of what the students have learned and their responsibility to it. Waldorf Education is a rare pedagogy that nurtures the individual.

<p>
</p>
<p><i>Why Iceland? During their time at the Brooklyn Waldorf School the class has studied subjects ranging from Norse Mythology to Earth Sciences, including Climate, Geology and Physiology.  They focus on these subjects for extended weeks at a time in a “Main Lesson” block.  At the end of this block they produce their own handwritten and illustrated textbook on the subject.  Waldorf Education is about learning not only through your head but also through your hands and heart. Traveling to Iceland and experiencing its rugged yet fragile environment will give the students an opportunity to experience a place that reflects the reality and legacy of these topics. </i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>This will be a practical and metaphoric journey. Iceland is geologically young and always in a state of change. These qualities, along with its simultaneous fragility and potential volatility reflect the adolescent state of mind.</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>The students will be able to feel the geological pulse that defines the island, observe the weather at its most primal, and walk in the space between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates: the site where the mid-Atlantic ridge rises from the sea and makes the earth’s inner workings over millions of years visible in our own time. They will gain a direct sense of the history of the people of Iceland, have a visceral experience of the climate and gain a new understanding of the micro and macro environment. A profound appreciation of time will be revealed through living for a few days under the midnight sun. </i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>Also critical to Waldorf Education is the power of creating beauty - whether through words, images or deeds.  These students will return from Iceland with original photographic work and recordings that will enable them to share this moving experience and inform others of the wonders and needs of both fire and ice.  They are making drawings of Icelandic landscapes as part of their study of the island and as preparation for their trip. These works comprise the rewards for donations at various levels. </i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>Help us realize this goal and make it possible for our 8th graders to culminate their studies with a trip that expands the curricular dimension rather than completes it. As they start to become adults these students will carry memories of Iceland’s fugitive landscape, its ancient stories and remarkable capacities for change to their future endeavors and communities. As witnesses to this evolving world, our students, in turn, will see themselves as agents of dynamic and sustainable transformation. </i></p>

The Jade Robot has been shown to be
superior in not only teaching students about robotics and programming but also excite and engage them in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (aka STEM).  

Surveys from students working with the Jade Robot, show the following successes:




25%+ increase in interest in STEM as a career


30%+ increase in interest in post-secondary
education


What makes the Jade Robot special is the results we are seeing with girls:



Girls match (and often exceed) the successes of boys have with the Jade Robot


After working with the Jade Robot, girls' interest in STEM as a career matches boys, even though their initial interest was only one third of that of boys


These numbers are not for ""gifted"" or members of a robot club, we work in typical classrooms with all types of students and are changing their attitudes towards STEM.

Installing and setting up the Jade Support Integrated Development Environment (IDE - Available Here for Chrome equipped systems) takes just a few moments:

Jade Support can be used for the development and debug of Scratch and C applications for the Jade Robot like this simple object avoidance project:

Along with being able to create your own programs, you can try out one of the hundreds of user created example applications available as ""Community Projects"".
What will Students be Doing with the Jade Robot?

Cross-Curriculum Learning

The Jade Robot provides practical, hands on educational opportunities in the following classroom studies:

Mathematics
Motion (Physics)

Mechanics with gears and wheels

Energy Conversion
Electricity and Electronics
Light and Optics
Chemistry
Space Exploration
Geology (with the reflectance spectrometer)
Art
Reading




The Jade robot also provides opportunities for children to develop ""soft skills"" including:

Teamwork
Problem Solving
Project Planning
Digital Literacy


Example Classroom Materials:



Grade 6 Classroom Materials


Grade 8 Classroom Materials



For students younger than high school age, we have
found that a two student to one Jade Robot is the optimum ratio.




Expanding the Jade Robot

Camera/Gripper 3D printed Parts Available on Thingiverse

The next adapter we're working on is a pen holder.  With the videos currently available showing the Jade Robot drawing is accomplished by holding a Crayola Washable (very important when drawing on a floor) Marker using elastic bands.  


I2C Expansion Ports are available for adding your own sensors and hardware:


What's in the future for expansion, we have some ideas.  What do you think of a Marshmallow Shooter for the Jade Robot?

Frequently Asked Questions





How can I contact you for problems, suggestions and sales opportunities?



Send an email to: info@mimetics.ca 



When I look at the videos and animations, the Jade Robot's screen is pulsating.  Does this happen on the actual robots?


No.  The pulsing that you see is an artifact of the camera and the display not being synchronized.  To the human eye, the actual display doesn't appear to pulse at all



Where can I get ongoing information about the Jade Robot



See Mimetics News above



Why aren't there covers on the Jade Robot?



As part of our process for defining the product, we interviewed 200 teachers and 100% told us they wanted their students to be able to touch and experience technology directly



Can Jade Support be used in  system that doesn't have an Internet connection?



No.  The decision was made to only execute in a networked environment was made for two reasons.  The first was to use cloud-based (GitHub) storage of user and community projects.  The second was to provide storage and invisible updates of the large file processing classes


This decision has been questioned, but we have never encountered a situation or venue where an internet connection was not available



What systems have you run the programming tools on?



WinXP, Win7, Win8, Macs OS 10.8 and later, Linux Ubuntu 11.04 and later, Chromebooks


Chrome version 42 or later is required



Where did the survey results listed at the top of this campaign page come from?



The survey results come from the 12,000 surveys given to class and workshop attendees since 2001


Before session responses being 26% interest in STEM for boys and 9% for girls (with a combined average of 17%).  These values match numerous studies done on STEM interest in children 12-14 which gives us confidence in our approach


After class/workshop interest in STEM shows an increase to 45-65%.  For Grade 6-8 students, the post class/workshop interest is normally 60% or more.  This interest declines for older students.  These results also match published studies which indicate that Grades 6-8 are the optimal time to interest students in STEM


In all age ranges, girls interest in STEM matches boys at the end of the sessions



How do I get software updates for Jade Support and the Jade Robot?



Updates to Jade Support happen automatically. You may be prompted to restart Jade Support if they come through when you have it up and active
Jade Robot firmware and file system image updates will be sent out when they are available with instructions on how to carry out the update


How is the robot charged and can it be charged from a PC?



Charging is accomplished through the USB Port


The Jade Robot can be charged from a PC



What is the recommended Age range for the Jade Robot?



8 Years and Up



How fragile is the Jade Robot?



The Jade Robot is very tough.  After four months of 5-12 classes per week for 16 Jade Robots, none have failed or had any hardware issues requiring repair



Can I control the Jade Robot remotely?


The Jade Robot's movements can be controlled using LG, Panasonic and Toshiba DVD IR Remote Controls

The Jade Robot with optional camera/gripper can be controlled via Bluetooth using ""Jade Action""



What surfaces will the Jade Robot run on?



Any typical inside surfaces (including carpeting)


Outside operation or use on wet surfaces will void the warranty



What about tablet and smartphone support?



We will be porting Jade Support onto Android and iOS devices in the future



What expansion products are available?



Currently we have .stl files for the Camera/Gripper and Pen Holder.  We sell Jade Robots with the Camera/Gripper installed


We have schematics and software for an I2C digital compass interface as well as a 6 axis accelerometer

Shipping is free for North American customers


International orders must click on the ""International Shipping"" and ""Class Set Shipping"" Perks along with the Jade Robot that you are interested in



What kind of Bluetooth Adapter is required?



Bluetooth 2.0 and later


NOTE: For older PCs, BT 2.0 devices have been found to work best



What is the Bluetooth Range?



We find that 10 metres in an empty space is possible


In practical environments, 7 metres is a good rule of thumb for a ""typical"" space with metal furniture and structures



How many Jade Robots can work in the same space?



We don't know.  Our current record is 22 Jade Robots in a classroom


Downloading programs and control operation can slow down if there are a lot of WiFi devices present but Jade Robot Bluetooth operations remain reliable

This peer-reviewed conference is organized by educators, for educators, to provide an opportunity to showcase the learning that takes place in this community of practice. All educators are encouraged to present, attend and take part in this discussion of collaborative deeper learning and co-presence in virtual worlds and games.<p></p> </div><div>This is our 8th annual conference which is only possible through generous donations from conference sponsors and the many volunteers that help put on this four day event. The conference materials are made available through our archives including the Journal of Virtual Studies (ISSN: 2155-0107), and over 100 hours of video / machinema'd materials available, for free, for educational and research purposes after each conference is over. </div><div>Each year VWBPE attracts between 2200-3500 educational professionals from around the world. Our tracks include presentations and workshops which span the entire gambit of education from K-12 all the way through to post-graduate levels. </div><div>See <a href=""http://vwbpe.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://vwbpe.org</a> for more details.</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What we need is simple. Cash donations. The conference costs a minimum of $5000 each year. We are in a position that we can do more with a larger budget up to $15,000 but $5,000 is the minimum amount we need to raise to make the conference successful. This is in a large part due to a few in-kind sponsors that have been dedicated to helping this conference succeed since it first started in 2007. </p>
<p>Funding goes completely (100%) to program related activities. No one involved with the organization of the conference receives a salary or stipend. Funds are used to help support our information systems, development of video and machinema archives, live video streaming, social activities, swag  bag materials for conference attendees, buildings supplies (mesh 3D objects), and graphics designs. </p>
<p>VWBPE also spends a lot of time ensuring that the conference is as accessible as possible for persons with disabilities. </p>

</div></div>","Summary Virtual Worlds Best Practices in Education is a global grass-roots community event focusing on education in immersive virtual environments. This peer-reviewed conference is organized by educators, for educators, to provide an opportunity to showcase the learning that takes place in this community of practice. All educators are encouraged to present, attend and take part in this discussion of collaborative deeper learning and co-presence in virtual worlds and games. This is our 8th annual conference which is only possible through generous donations from conference sponsors and the many volunteers that help put on this four day event. The conference materials are made available through our archives including the Journal of Virtual Studies (ISSN: 2155-0107), and over 100 hours of video / machinema'd materials available, for free, for educational and research purposes after each conference is over. Each year VWBPE attracts between 2200-3500 educational professionals from around the world. Our tracks include presentations and workshops which span the entire gambit of education from K-12 all the way through to post-graduate levels. See http://vwbpe.org for more details.  What We Need & What You Get What we need is simple. Cash donations. The conference costs a minimum of $5000 each year. We are in a position that we can do more with a larger budget up to $15,000 but $5,000 is the minimum amount we need to raise to make the conference successful. This is in a large part due to a few in-kind sponsors that have been dedicated to helping this conference succeed since it first started in 2007. 
Funding goes completely (100%) to program related activities. No one involved with the organization of the conference receives a salary or stipend. Funds are used to help support our information systems, development of video and machinema archives, live video streaming, social activities, swag  bag materials for conference attendees, buildings supplies (mesh 3D objects), and graphics designs. 
VWBPE also spends a lot of time ensuring that the conference is as accessible as possible for persons with disabilities.
