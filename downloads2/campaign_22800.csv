<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>“The world is depressing enough. If you have the ability and the talent to bring hope and joy into someone’s life then you have the obligation to do that”<br/>(<i>An American in Paris the Musical</i>). </strong></p>
<p>I watched from the balcony of the Palace Theatre in New York, as the character Adam <br/>Hochberg, a composer surrounded by a world still in turmoil after the devastations of WWII, discovers, after many dreary minor key trials, how his music can successfully bring people hope and joy. He speaks this quotation after the opening of his ballet when he sees the faces of the audience brighten for the first time since the war. If he has the ability to accomplish this, then it is his duty to the world to do so. Light in the Dark Theatre, as well, can bring hope and joy to our distressing world as we have been given the gift to accomplish this; so, it is our responsibility to do so. Adam Hochberg and the writers of An American in Paris were asking us to ‘step up’ – to inform people of the light in the world, inspire hope, and incite them into positive action. Therefore, Light in the Dark Theatre aspires to tell stories that leave an audience with a sense of hope – a sense that they can make a positive difference in this world. </p>
<p>My name is Emily and I am the Founder and Artistic Director of Light in the Dark Theatre. I grew up in a very small rural Alberta town which did not offer a lot of  artistic opportunity. Luckily, I had a family who was willing to drive me multiple times a week to cities hours away in order to give me the opportunity to experience and partake in theatre. Not all children have this luxury so I want to bring theatre to them. Part of Light in the Dark Theatre's goals is to bring these stories of hope to rural communities in Alberta which have minimal arts options due to their physical location. We also want to provide these communities with artistic training opportunities in their own towns so that families do not have to drive hours from home for their children to learn about the performing arts. </p>
<p>But we need your help to bring these stories of hope to rural communities in Alberta!</p>
<p>Where your money will be going:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Transportation </strong>- It takes a lot of funds to transport sets, props, costumes, and a cast to multiple locations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rehearsal Space</strong> - We need somewhere to rehearse our shows before we take them on the road, and renting a space to do so costs a lot. So your funds will help us pay for time in a rehearsal hall where we can take our shows from the script to the stage.</li>
<li>
<strong>Advertisements</strong> - We need people to know about us and the stories of hope we are telling! We want to create a new website for our company as well as posters, business cards, and brochures so that these rural communities know about us and what we offer! </li>
<li>
<strong>People</strong> - We like to pay people for the hard work they do! For each show we produce, we need to pay actors, directors, designers,  and many other people who are already working for free to keep this company going. </li>
<li>
<strong>Rights and Licencing </strong>- We have to pay performance rights for each show we produce. This money goes to the playwrights who created the scripts we are performing. We also have fees such as SOCAN rights which allow us to play music in our shows.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Light in the Dark Theatre's past shows: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><i>Dani Girl </i>by Micheal Kooman and Christopher Dimond; performed in Rosebud, Alberta. </p></li>
<li><p><i>Twisted Tales: Snow White</i> by Adam Furfaro; performed in Peace River, Alberta </p></li>
<li><p><i>Punch Up</i> by Kat Sandler; performed in Rumsey, Alberta </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Light in the Dark Theatre's Upcoming Shows: </strong></p>
<ul><li>
<i>Never Swim Alone</i> by Daniel MacIvor; to be performed at the 2019 Edmonton Fringe Festival</li></ul>
<p>We are hoping to produce another show this coming fall which will tour to multiple rural communities in Alberta, but we need your help to make this become a reality!</p>

</ul><p></p></div>","What is Hybridge Arts Collective?Hybridge Arts Collective was founded in 2010 by Britney Hines, Sam Tower, and Kelly Turner. The primary mission of Hybridge Arts is to produce new and emerging artists in Philadelphia and to educate developing artists in the essentials of self producing. To achieve this mission, we produce two performance platforms, Last Mondays and Blueprint Breakout Series.Last Mondays, which returns to Philly in June and July, is a one-night-only forum designed to showcase artists' current work-in-progress. The line-up always includes performance makers of multiple artistic disciplines, allowing audiences and artists to engage with new forms. This October we continue Blueprint Breakout Series, a self-producing incubator program geared towards emerging artists with bold ideas for medium to full length works. Hybridge partners with an artist over 3 months as they create an original project. Over the course of the incubator, Hybridge mentors the artist on the essential skills of self-producing. The curriculum includes lessons and resources in marketing, fundraising, press relations, and technical production. The artist in residence concludes the incubator with two nights of performance in a Philadelphia venue.Hybridge Arts will kick off its fourth season of year-round programming in February with ID:3, a triple bill of new performance works, presented at Christ Church Neighborhood House. ID:3 features three mid-length dance and theatre works; SBF: Single Black Female  by Britney Hines, Beast by Kelly Turner and THE TRAVELERS by Sam Tower. The evening’s performances tackle the complexity of personal and social identity in modern society.(Image from MOSQUE by Jihad Milhem. Photo © Jacques-Jean Tiziou / www.jjtiziou.net )The secondary mission of Hybridge Arts Collective is to present affordable and accessible performance art that pushes boundaries. We keep the ticket price at $5 for Last Mondays and Blueprint Breakout Series and the evening always includes a delicious home-cooked vegetarian meal.As we continue to improve our performance quality and provide our artists with better resources, our production costs are inevitably going up. We want to keep our ticket prices as low as possible, so we can continue to provide the highest standard of work at the most affordable rate.

Where does the money go? 

This Indiegogo Campaign will raise funds for our fourth year of affordable performance by new and emerging artists.

We are fundraising for a total of $4000. 

The money raised in this campaign will help fund our operating expenses as they increase this year. In 2014, we will produce the two performance series our audiences have come to love, plus an additional triple bill platform!These increased expenses include:



Space rental and co-working space


Stipend for Blueprint Breakout Artists 


Technical supplies 


Designer and Production Manager Stipends


Website service fees


Insurance


Food costs





 The Impact

Hybridge Arts Collective is one of the few organizations that is dedicated to serving new and emerging performance artists in Philadelphia. The majority of our artists have been presenting work professionally in Philadelphia for less than five years.

Last Mondays fosters a space where artists can meet creators from different disciplines, introduce their work to new audiences, and share a sense of community. Blueprint Breakout Series provides an emerging artist the chance to learn more about self-producing in Philadelphia through workshops and hands on experience. (Image of Last Mondays Performance Series at Broad Street Ministry)

<h1>STORY</h1>
<div>Kim Tobin &amp; Philip Lehl started STARK NAKED THEATRE because they believed there was a need for a professional theatre company in Houston dedicated to a simple mission with its primary objectives being to - create extraordinary professional theatre and pay  the professional artists who create those productions the wages they deserve in accordance to the training and expertise that would be afforded any expert in any field coming out of college, or an equitable training program with a highly specialized skill set.    The name Stark Naked is a reflection of our philosophy in all things -  being truthful or to be ""naked"" and honest in our artistic work and all things in our company.</div>
<h1>Match Challenge</h1>
<div>
<b>A group of regular Stark Naked Theatre donors have come together and made a $25,000 challenge for the Stark Naked Theatre to match!! </b> <b>If we can raise $25k they will donate $25k making it a total of $50,000 </b>toward paying artists for the remaining 3 shows of our 2014-2015 season.  As you know what we charge for admission to our performances only covers 1/3 of the production costs for the high caliber professional theatre Stark Naked is committed to bring to our audiences.  We depend on individual donors along with grants and corporate sponsors to support and fill in the remaining operating costs for our theatre.  </div>
<div>
<b>ALL FUNDS RAISED IN THIS CAMPAIGN GO DIRECTLY TO ARTISTS PAY.</b>
</div>
<div><b>We believe in full transparency at Stark Naked and our budget for artists (actors/designers/directors/crew) this year is $74,615.00.  That number only pays our union artists $250 a week and our non-union artists about $129 a week.  We still have quite a long way to go before we are able to pay our artists a living wage here at Stark Naked, but the progress we have made in our short life span as a company is because of all of you!

The Project 

Sources Of Light Other Than The Sun is an unnerving and unrelenting examination of five weeks in the trenches on The Western Front of WWI. The story concentrates on the lives of four young soldiers enduring all the horrors of modern warfare; a generation trying to make sense of the new and chaotic world that is forming around them. Examining the physical and emotional traumas experienced during the Great War, Sources Of Light… attempts to capture a snapshot of what life was for these men. Taking place in near-total darkness, the vita of its characters is brought to light. 


Where is my money going? 

Our show has been accepted in the 2016 Thespis Festival in NYC, but in order to bring it to life, there are a number of things that we need. The goals of this campaign are two-fold:

The first is practical, it costs money to do a show. Your contributions will be used for:


Rehearsal space rental
Purchase of props and costumes
Printing of promotional material and programs
Other inherent costs of producing a play in New York City.

The second reason for this campaign is to raise money to compensate the artists involved in this project. Too often young artists are asked to donate their talents in the name of having a ""learning experience"". We want to pay our artists for their time and the use of their amazing talent. While we will of course not be providing them with a Broadway salary, a small stipend can go a long way in the life of a freelancer.
Your contributions are ESSENTIAL to the success of this show; and without you, we simply cannot make it happen. Even one dollar can make a difference!


Where is this happening?  Sources Of Light Other Than The Sun will be presented at the Hudson Guild Theatre on West 26th street in New York City. There will be three performances in the first week of August. Tickets will be available both online and at the door. 
The dates and times are:
August 1st at 9:00pm
August 3r at 9:00pm
August 6th at 3:30pm

Circle has a long history of collaborating with social organizations in the creation of meaningful dance experiences. This time we are partnering with Bridge Refugee Services for World Refugee Day. Celebrations begin on Friday June 20th at 5pm. Please come see our show and share our campaign with your friends!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3><p>The Upstart Crows of Salem are a brand new,
collaboratively run classical theatre company based in Salem, Massachusetts,
just north of Boston. We’re a group of young actors and artists who banded
together three months ago to create our own space to make theatre and explore the
plays of Shakespeare, his contemporaries, and other non-realistic dramatists. We’re
passionate about telling stories and persuading you, the audience, to enter
into a different world by giving you what a night out at the theatre ought to
be: an enjoyable evening’s entertainment. When you come to our show, we hope
you’ll be fascinated and moved and challenged, but above all, we want you have
fun! Come out and play with us. </p>
<p>The Upstart Crows are currently in rehearsal for our
first production, William Shakespeare’s <i>Love’s
Labour's Lost</i>, which runs June 6-8 at the Gazebo on Salem Common- and
admission will be FREE! It’s a witty, fast-paced, hysterically funny romantic comedy
that’s spiked with a streak of darkness and plays fast and loose with our usual
idea of its genre. Set in the late 1920s, our production takes full advantage
of the lush yet elegant backdrop of Salem Common and features original music
composed by local musician Jasmine Meyers. On June 7, we’ll present a teaser
excerpt from the play at the Salem Arts Festival. We can’t wait to work with
the Arts Festival and bring our play into the middle of Salem to share with the
city! The cast and crew are hard at work bringing <i>Love’s Labour's</i> to life, and many of us are doing double duty,
working not only as actors but as directors, designers, business managers,
dramaturgs, publicists, photographers- name the job, and you can bet one of us
is onto it. And we’re learning as we go: none of us has ever run our own
theatre company before. So far, every penny we’ve spent on the Upstart Crows
and <i>Love’s Labour's Lost </i>has come out
of our own pockets. Now we’re asking for your generous help to make sure that
our production reaches the stage with all our bills paid. In addition to
meeting the expenses of costumes, set, technical equipment, advertising, and
much more, we offer our cast and crew members a small stipend of $50 per
person. Every member of the company is working exceptionally hard, and as
professional working artists who have chosen to pour their time, energy, and resources into
this production, they deserve our heartfelt thanks. We only wish we could offer
them more.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us in so many ways. Here
are just a few of the expenses you’ll be helping us to meet:</p>
<p>$15 pays for 7 paper lanterns to adorn our set</p>
<p>$25 pays for 50 beautiful posters to advertise our
play around the local area</p>
<p>$35 pays for the fabric for the Princess of France’s
evening dress</p>
<p>$50 pays a stipend to help reimburse a cast or crew
member for their transportation expenses</p>
<p>$75 pays the required fee to the City of Salem for the
use of Salem Common</p>
<p>$100 pays for all of our props and makeup</p>
<p>$150 pays for a portable toilet rental so that our
audience can enjoy the second half of the show in comfort</p>
<p>Every cent of out $1500 target amount will be spent on
this production of <i>Love’s Labour's Lost</i>.
$1000 will cover stipends for every member of the cast and crew. The remaining
$500 will be devoted to diverse production needs such as costumes, advertising,
and port-o-pottie rental (we weren’t kidding when we said our needs were
diverse). If we don’t meet our target goal, the show will still go on, with
whatever sum we have raised- but we’d much prefer to go onstage fully funded,
with your help. We’ve got some great Shakespeare-themed souvenirs lined up to
thank you for your contributions (check them out below!) And each and every one
of you will receive credit for your generosity in our program- unless you
prefer to mysteriously veil your identity under the title “Anonymous.” Just let
us know what you prefer.</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you’re ensuring that
the Upstart Crows kick off our first production standing on solid ground and
enable us to invest in the future of our company. The less we as a company are
forced to worry about money, the more we’re free to focus on creating the best
show possible for our audiences. If we can meet all of our expenses for this
production up front, any donations that we receive during the run of the show
(admission to every performance is free, with donations gratefully accepted)
will be invested in future productions. Summer street theatre in downtown
Salem, full-length indoor productions of Shakespeare and other playwrights of
his time, medieval mystery plays, a May Day festival, programs for kids…we’ve
got so much to offer, so many stories to tell and dreams to make real. This is
our beginning, and we want you to be a part of it.</p>
<p>If you really, truly can’t donate to our campaign (and
believe us, we do understand), there’s still something important you can do. Share

you know someone in the Boston area who might enjoy our show, point them in our
direction! Keep in touch, and we hope we’ll see your face out in the crowd one
night. </p><br/></div>","The Upstart Crows of Salem are a brand new,

After producing three successful runs of <i>Black Is the Color</i> in both Shanghai and New York City, the PtS team and I are now looking for your help to take our work to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe this August!</p><p>Thanks for checking out our funding page and considering supporting <i>Black Is the Color</i>. Every donation counts towards making this very expensive dream a financial reality for Play the Spotlight, and we very dearly appreciate any and all help you can send our way!</p><p><b>THE STORY</b></p><p><i>Black Is the Color of My Voice</i> follows the life of Mena Bordeaux, a successful jazz singer seeking redemption after the untimely death of her father. During a three-day period of isolation without cigarettes, alcohol, or access to the outside world, Mena reflects on the journey that took her from a young piano prodigy destined for a life in the service of the church to a renowned jazz vocalist at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement.</p><div>

<p><b>INSPIRATION</b></p>
<p>About five years ago I began learning about the life of legendary jazz singer Nina Simone. Deeply affected by her music, I was particularly drawn to a specific time in her life in which she underwent a period of isolated spiritual cleansing in Liberia. I was very interested in that idea--what kind of experience would <i>that </i>woman have in <i>that</i>environment, cut off from the outside world, making peace with her past? I created the character of Mena Bordeaux to explore that environment, a physical space and narrative structure reflecting a mediation between the past and present, the living and the dead. <i>Black Is the Color of My Voice </i>is the result of that exploration.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/001/687/121/56850397018845c0496528c6614dcc29_large.gif?1393546184"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><b>CRITICAL RECEPTION</b></p>
<p>So far, <i>Black Is the Color of My Voice </i>has had three successful runs--two in Shanghai and one at New York City's Midtown International Theatre Festival. We have had several sold-out shows, and the the response by both media and audience members has been truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>Here are a few things people have been saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>""<i>Black is the Color of My Voice</i> shines, bringing a little bit of American soul to Shanghai theatre.""      <i><b>-TimeOut Shanghai</b></i>
</li>
<li>""Campbell transfixed, she charmed, she entertained and ultimately moved a packed theater with her touching portrayal of a jazz musician reeling and reminiscing in the aftermath of her father's death.""      -<i><b>SmartShanghai.com</b></i>
</li>
<li>""Memories of her life's most decisive moments and choices are evoked, flashbacks solely carried by Apphia's expressional performance and powerful singing voice, which do justice to her source of inspiration.""<b>     <i>-Shanghaiist</i></b>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>WHY EDINBURGH?</b></p>
<p>While Shanghai's burgeoning theatre scene is a great place to develop and try new ideas within a supportive community, it's a very difficult city to produce or perform theatre on an international level. The Edinburgh Fringe is the world's largest arts festival and is one of the best places on Earth for small, independent work to be discovered.

After producing three successful runs of Black Is the Color in both Shanghai and New York City, the PtS team and I are now looking for your help to take our work to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe this August!Thanks for checking out our funding page and considering supporting Black Is the Color. Every donation counts towards making this very expensive dream a financial reality for Play the Spotlight, and we very dearly appreciate any and all help you can send our way!THE STORYBlack Is the Color of My Voice follows the life of Mena Bordeaux, a successful jazz singer seeking redemption after the untimely death of her father. During a three-day period of isolation without cigarettes, alcohol, or access to the outside world, Mena reflects on the journey that took her from a young piano prodigy destined for a life in the service of the church to a renowned jazz vocalist at the forefront of the Civil Rights Movement.

INSPIRATION
About five years ago I began learning about the life of legendary jazz singer Nina Simone. Deeply affected by her music, I was particularly drawn to a specific time in her life in which she underwent a period of isolated spiritual cleansing in Liberia. I was very interested in that idea--what kind of experience would that woman have in thatenvironment, cut off from the outside world, making peace with her past? I created the character of Mena Bordeaux to explore that environment, a physical space and narrative structure reflecting a mediation between the past and present, the living and the dead. Black Is the Color of My Voice is the result of that exploration.


CRITICAL RECEPTION
So far, Black Is the Color of My Voice has had three successful runs--two in Shanghai and one at New York City's Midtown International Theatre Festival. We have had several sold-out shows, and the the response by both media and audience members has been truly extraordinary.
Here are a few things people have been saying:

""Black is the Color of My Voice shines, bringing a little bit of American soul to Shanghai theatre.""      -TimeOut Shanghai

""Campbell transfixed, she charmed, she entertained and ultimately moved a packed theater with her touching portrayal of a jazz musician reeling and reminiscing in the aftermath of her father's death.""      -SmartShanghai.com

""Memories of her life's most decisive moments and choices are evoked, flashbacks solely carried by Apphia's expressional performance and powerful singing voice, which do justice to her source of inspiration.""     -Shanghaiist


WHY EDINBURGH?
While Shanghai's burgeoning theatre scene is a great place to develop and try new ideas within a supportive community, it's a very difficult city to produce or perform theatre on an international level. The Edinburgh Fringe is the world's largest arts festival and is one of the best places on Earth for small, independent work to be discovered. We've shown Shanghai what Black Is the Color has to offer and have been rewarded for our efforts--now it's time to take it to the next level.
WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES
Despite being called a one-woman show, it will take a whole group of talented people working together to make Black Is the Color of My Voice an Edinburgh success. Your financial backing will go a long way to help fund Play the Spotlight's three-person performer/producer/director team as we travel to Edinburgh and back, secure music licensing, distribute promotional materials, create merchandise, handle marketing and PR, and pay for a performance space while not going hungry, homeless, or crazy. Hopefully.

<p>Historic Interpretations, Inc. brings history to life!  With your help, we can bring our new version of the classic English Christmas Play, Saint George and the Dragon, to the Raleigh stage in time for Christmas!</p>
Our new version is a charming retelling of the greatest of the mummer's plays, the folk plays of the Middle Ages.  The audience will travel back in time to the Christmas celebrations of long-ago, which begin with a parade of knights, princesses, kings, queens, and, of course, a dragon.  They'll witness miraculous medical practitioners who believe they can cure all ailments, and see Father Christmas preside over exaggerated sword and shield battles, Christmas Carols, madrigal songs, court dances, and the heroic, and romantic escapades, of England's great hero, Saint George.  <br/><p>A composite version drawn from surviving manuscripts and woven together from bits of old text, folk legends, and medieval Christmas plays, the entire story is all told in the traditional rhymed dialogue used in the ancient plays, but with updated language for modern audiences.  So, join in making Saint George and the Dragon part of Raleigh's annual holiday traditions!</p>

<p>Science Fiction Theatre Company's mission is to bring the genre of science fiction to the stage in the form of established, original and adapted works. We seek to build a community of like-minded individuals who look at fiction in terms of the possibilities. We seek to ask the question 'What is reality'. To further express what we are looking to achieve we refer to the following quote by the great author Philip K. Dick...<br/><br/> All of our work ""starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one, single, objective reality. Everything is a matter of perception. The ground is liable to shift under your feet. A protagonist may find himself living out another person's dream...that actually makes better sense than the real world, or he may cross into a different universe completely.""</p>
<p><strong>What is Solace?</strong></p>
<p>If you could bring them back, wouldn’t you? The answer is obvious for Julia, whose husband is lost in space during a recent mission. Everyone from her boss to her own mother tells Julia that she needs to accept her loss and move on. But Julia knows in her heart that her husband is still out there, and that she's the only one who can find him.</p>
<p>Armed with her brilliant mind and a sarcastic GPS, Julia sets out to accomplish the impossible.</p>
<p>Solace is a new work written by A. Vincent Ularich and directed by Anna Trachtman. It follows Julia as she tries to convince the world that it’s not too late and get her husband back. Thomas, her husband, went missing while on a one man mission and is presumed dead. Being the brilliant person she is Julia builds a spaceship, “perfects” AI, and goes off to find him; but not before dealing with her over shadowing mother, her stressed out boss, and new friend. It’s an out-of-this-world drama about the motivations and perseverance of the human heart.</p>
<p>We’ve been working on this show for a while now. The first reading of the original draft was year ago. Since then the script has gone through several rewrites.  A staged reading of the first act was done for three nights last November . The main goal of the reading was to work shop the script and get some feedback. It was huge success! The biggest question asked: “when can we see the rest?” Well we’re finally ready to show the world what we've got! With a full cast and crew, a finale draft, and whole lot of passion we couldn’t be more excited.</p>
<p>We need your help though. Producing theatre isn’t cheap.  On top of paying everyone for their hard work, we need to pay for supplies, props, costumes, and rent for the actual theater. We have two full sets to construct; a living room and a space ship. A cast of six and a crew of seven and everyone is working overtime shoulder the weight. It really does take a village… errr a mission control to run a show.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate any support you can give us, and in that way you’re joining our team. So help us send Julia to space!</p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p><strong>Supplies (We’re building a spaceship!)</strong></p>
<p>The set really is its own character. The lights, the sounds, the very look of the stage bring the show to life. We’re looking at $1200 for building supplies, lights, props, and costumes. The majority of these funds, $600, will go towards set construction.  </p>
<p>We need $300 for lighting and sound. It’s a tech heavy show with spaceships being launched, meteor showers, and sarcastic AIs.</p>
<p>Another $300 for costumes and props, because sometimes the clothes really do make the astronaut.</p>
<p><strong>Stipends (It takes a village… errr a mission control)</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard work and long hours to pull off something like this and we want to make sure everyone get paid. $1200 in stipends are going out to the cast and crew. Along with big big ""thank you""s for making this all possible.</p>
<p>We need another $900 for renting the theater. For supporting us we are offering some pretty awesome perks. You should check them out!</p>
<p><strong>Our Past Productions</strong></p>
<p>This will be Science Fiction Theatre Company’s fourth production.</p>
<p>Dark Matters followed a woman and her family coping with the idea that she may have been the victim of an alien abduction.</p>
<p>On Ego was the story of routine teleportation gone wrong resulting in two versions of the protagonist. He had to make the ultimate sacrifice to allow his other self to live on.</p>
<p>Our last show Man in the Couch was about a soldier being teleported into a woman’s living room. Only problem is now he’s fused with her couch.</p>
<p>If you haven’t caught on yet we like SciFi. Especially shows that have those make it or break it moments.  Like teleporting a person into a couch. In front of the audience. And making it look believable.  We’re New England’s only exclusively science fiction theatre company and we’re proud to say it!</p>

<em><strong><br/></strong></em><strong>The Show!</strong>
</h3>
<p>My stateside debut will take place at the The New York Burlesque Festival's Premiere Party on Friday 27th September. The festival goes on for 4 glittering days across several venues in the city. I'll perform alongside a variety of well respected names on the Burlesque scene in what I'm sure will be the highlight of my Burlesque career to date!</p>

<h3>The revealing truth...</h3>
<p>In 2010 my life in Burlesque began, and it has taken me on an incredible adventure so far. The creative people I get to meet and work with never cease to amaze and inspire me, and there's nothing I'd rather do than this.</p>
<p>It's a dream job, but it still takes blood, sweat and tears to create an act that's just right. A hell of a lot of time and funds go into the lead up to those five glorious minutes on stage! But it's so worth it when you're presented with amazing opportunities.</p>
<p>I have just been invited to perform at this year's New York Burlesque Festival which, I'm not afraid to admit, is an absolute dream of mine. It is an unpaid performance (with the exception of a $25 honorarium, which might help with my transport from the airport!) but an unmissable opportunity nonetheless.</p>
<p>This trip will be purely for business, and as much as I would love to go and see the sights, that's something that will have to wait until another day when I can take a holiday!</p>
<p>I'm striving to make my appearance at The New York Burlesque Festival happen, but the truth is that I can't do it without your help.</p>
<p>I'll be keeping a diary of the events leading up to and during the festival so you can keep track of what's going on, I'll update you on my Facebook page: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/tabithataboo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/tabithataboo</a>  and in the Tales of Taboo section on my website: <a href=""http://www.tabithataboo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tabithataboo.com</a> so stay tuned!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tit for tat...</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My purpose here is not to raise the entire amount I need for the trip, but just enough to cover my flight and therefore ease some of the financial pressure. The minimum I am allowed to pitch for is £500 and so that will be the amount I will aim for. The flight will cost just over £480 and so the remaining £20 would be put towards getting my prop shipped over to NYC. If I do exceed my goal, then I shall lavish myself with Champagne and eat only the finest caviar for lunch!</p>
<p>Now, rarely do you get something for nothing...which is why in return for your contribution I'll be offering a variety of goodies, including exclusive signed and kissed pin up photos of yours truly, limited edition Tabitha Taboo artwork, and tickets to see a special one-off act performed in the heart of London's Soho! Just choose the reward you like the most, make your contribution, and hey presto...I'll be a few steps closer to showing NYC a little Taboo!</p>

</h3><p><b>THE PROJECT:</b></p>
<p>      <i>If you gaze long enough into the abyss, the
abyss will gaze back into you.’ (Nietzsche)</i></p><p>We, Hungry Bird Theater, gaze into
the abyss of a story of epic proportions! 
Edna and Vinnie, two down-and-out showbiz con artists, have survived
mass-scale environmental catastrophe and now journey through the dry,
devastated, burned landscape of what they hope is Nevada.  Edna is eighteen months pregnant and holding
that baby inside her until they reach safety. 
Vinnie is convinced that even the apocalypse can’t obliterate Las Vegas,
so that’s where they’re headed…  </p>
<p>We created
this show, titled “Get No Place Fast,” last year, and first performed it at San
Francisco’s FuryFactory Festival in 2014.  This
summer we will take it to the next level of development before we bring it to
the San Francisco Fringe!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hungry Bird’s mission statement proposes that a story is ‘a
wild, living thing.’  Our process is
based on integrity of investigation rather than aimed at knowable results.  We propose that this story ‘gazes back at
us;’ therefore our creative process hinges on a cycle of generating material,
then listening to how it resounds.  We
move forward based on that knowledge rather than on our individual artistic
agendas.</p>On
a macro level, we believe that today’s world needs theater –that amidst an
environment of screens and special effects, the dialogue between actors and a
live audience is powerful, precious, and electric (in a way that doesn’t need
to be plugged into the wall).  Media that
comes to us through screens can be edited, but live performance exists only in
the moment that it is played before people. 
Herein lies its power to create community and dialogue around who we
are, what we value, and where our world is headed.<div>

<p>Duo, 8 minutes </p>
<p>Le duo<i> Mono Lisa</i>, chorégraphié par Itzik
Galili, est dansé sur une trame sonore faite des cliquetis d’une machine à
écrire. L’œuvre s’ouvre sur plusieurs rangées de spots lumineux qui jettent une
lumière vive sur le plateau sombre et recréent l’atmosphère d’une usine. Dans
cet étrange environnement, imprégné de sons et de visions de fer et d’acier, un
couple de danseurs vêtus de costumes couleur rouille virevolte, s’enroule et
s’enlace en d’extraordinaires circonvolutions rapides défiant la gravité. Ce
pas de deux aux mouvements acrobatiques époustouflants est exécuté avec une
maîtrise absolue.</p>
<blockquote>« L'art de Galili
repose sur sa capacité de jouer de finesse avec l’abstraction et la narration,
créant des œuvres qui nous marquent profondément. Il est à ce jour l’un des seuls
chorégraphes travaillant aux Pays-Bas qui puisse établir ce fragile équilibre
entre humour, violence, lyrisme, sexualité et élégance. » Michael A. Kros,

Lisa, choreographed by Itzik Galili, is danced to sounds based on the noises of

spatial surroundings, filled with sounds and visions of iron and steel, a
couple of dancers in rust-colored costumes twist and turn, twine and entwine in
extraordinary convolutions and rapidity, with the partners always defying
gravity. The incredible acrobatics are executed with breathtaking control.</i></p><blockquote>

** La pièce que vous allez aider à financer // The choreography you will help fund
Photo: Alan Kohl | Artistes: Céline Cassone et Mark CasertaItzik Galili, « Le mouvement est mon langage, ma
manière de communiquer. C’est un langage sans parole, ce qui le rend d’autant
plus éloquent. »
“Movement
is my language, my means of communicating; a wordless language which makes it
all the more eloquent,” Itzik Galili
Duo, 8 minutes 
Le duo Mono Lisa, chorégraphié par Itzik
Galili, est dansé sur une trame sonore faite des cliquetis d’une machine à
écrire. L’œuvre s’ouvre sur plusieurs rangées de spots lumineux qui jettent une
lumière vive sur le plateau sombre et recréent l’atmosphère d’une usine. Dans
cet étrange environnement, imprégné de sons et de visions de fer et d’acier, un
couple de danseurs vêtus de costumes couleur rouille virevolte, s’enroule et
s’enlace en d’extraordinaires circonvolutions rapides défiant la gravité. Ce
pas de deux aux mouvements acrobatiques époustouflants est exécuté avec une
maîtrise absolue.
« L'art de Galili
repose sur sa capacité de jouer de finesse avec l’abstraction et la narration,
créant des œuvres qui nous marquent profondément. Il est à ce jour l’un des seuls
chorégraphes travaillant aux Pays-Bas qui puisse établir ce fragile équilibre
entre humour, violence, lyrisme, sexualité et élégance. » Michael A. Kros,
Ballettanz International, mars 2007****************************************Duet, 8 minutes Mono
Lisa, choreographed by Itzik Galili, is danced to sounds based on the noises of
a typewriter. It opens on several rows of spots, casting a bold light on the
dark stage, creating the atmosphere of a factory plant. In these bizarre
spatial surroundings, filled with sounds and visions of iron and steel, a
couple of dancers in rust-colored costumes twist and turn, twine and entwine in
extraordinary convolutions and rapidity, with the partners always defying
gravity. The incredible acrobatics are executed with breathtaking control.
 “Galili’s art
lies in his capacity to balance abstration and narration with finesse, creating
works that impress themselves strongly upon us. He is one of the only a few
choreographers working in the Netherlands today who can structure a fragile
equilibrium between humour, aggression, lyricism, sex and elegance,” Michael A.
Kros, Ballettanz International, March
2007.

** L'impact// The ImpactAjouter ce

voulons montrer plusieurs signatures et couleurs lors d’une représentation pour
exposer le public à une variété de styles de danse mais également pour
permettre aux artistes de s’enrichir de leurs rencontres avec différents chorégraphes. Travailler avec des talents comme Itzik Galili est la preuve de

</h3> <p>As a graduate of THE Grambling State University's theatre department, I have always had the dream of putting on my own productions.  In 2009, I had the chance to produce <i>The</i> <i>Serial Killer, </i>a play I wrote that tackled the issue of HIV and AIDs in the African-American community.  I received my first taste of success with that show.  Now after 6 years, a child and 5 years of teaching theatre to middle school students, I am ready to get back on track to accomplishing my goals.</p>
<p>One thing I pride myself on is writing and producing shows that mean something.  I don't want to just entertain people but I want to inspire them.  I want to inspire them to think, to change, to become better people and in return, make the world a better place.  <i>Worn Out Soles </i>was written with this in mind.  This play tackles the ugly side of human interaction: the way we judge those that are different from us and less fortunate than we may be.  After watching the show, I want my audience to feel something, be it guilt, shame, sympathy or empathy.  I just want them to feel.  <i>Worn Out Soles</i> has the potential to tap into that hardened place in the hearts of many and allow them to see people in a different and more human way.</p>
<p>With your help, this goal of my can be easily achieved.  You have the opportunity to be a part of something that is special and very close to my heart.  As a contributor you can help this single mom get on the right path to accomplishing every goal I have set for myself.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h2>How Much Money Are We Talking About Here?</h2>
<p>We've managed to fund most of our produciton budget, but we still 
need to raise $10,000 to reach our production goals.  We're on a 
shoestring budget, but shoestrings aren't cheap in NYC.  Whatever amount
 you can donate, you will be making a vital contribution towards making 
our theater a reality!</p>
<p>Our current production budget breaks down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theatre and rehearsal space rental - <strong>$12,000</strong>
</li>
<li>Rehearsal space rental:  <strong>$1,500</strong>
</li>
<li>Actors, director, and designer fees - <strong>$13,900</strong>
</li>
<li>Production personnel - <strong>$3,500</strong>
</li>
<li>Production materials/rentals - <strong>$4,500</strong>
</li>
<li>Marketing/PR - <strong>$1,500</strong>
</li>
<li>Additional expenses - <strong>$1,400</strong>
</li>
<li>Current budget total - <strong>$38,300</strong>

</ul><p>So we're close!  Whatever amount you're able to donate would be very helpful and much appreciated.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The concept of The Spring Fling is simple: to present 8 one-act plays about relationships in New York by up-and-coming New York playwrights, set in a non-traditional theatre space. The goal is that by producing a piece about a bar actually at a bar, or a piece set in an office in an real office space (or in this case, a theatre space with accessible components such as a bar and office area), we can make these authors' work more immediate, accessible, and surprising, and provide an innovative and memorable theatre-going experience that will attract a generation of audience members in New York that is generally underrepresented (20-30 somethings).

Our Story
Our vision for this FCN theme is to be focused on the function of the Filipino Family Dynamic* Each character in our play is based on people that we have known in our lifetime which is why this production is closer to our hearts than ever. Each expression and every single trait of our characters are real and we need all the help we can get to bring these characters to life on stage
In our Filipino Culture Night, we will address problems such as: the lack of conversation in a family household, family relationships, drug abuse, gambling and excessive alcoholic intake, early teenage pregnancy, questioning one’s sexual orientation, domestic violence, violence against women and those with severe disabilities.
On a more personal level, this may be one of the few if not one of our last chances in passing the message along to our own family. Our hope is that the actions which will be projected through the play will resonate in the minds of those present and hopefully have families begin some form of dialogue with one another. Please help us in having our voices heard.

For the past twenty-eight years that we put on this production, we have always wished for the general admission to be absolutely free of charge. However, the amount of money we raise is still not enough to cover the venue and other additional fees. It hurts us to ask for extra help to subsidize the cost, but we promise you, this is something that you won't regret investing yourself into. We are young students who wish to hold onto our roots. We want to understand ourselves. We need for others to understand us. Intindihin Mo Ako. ""Understand Me.""
Tickets


Pre-Sale Tickets $3

 If we are still unable to raise the $15,000+ then all the funds raised will go directly back into the organization and to next year’s production to give them a head start.

What YOU Get
With the funds raised you will get a very special spot in our program! Whatever sponsor you choose to be, you will be greatly appreciated and will go down in Samahan history much like our infamous Philippine Heroes! If you donate a certain amount, you’ll be known as the:

Lapu-Lapu Sonsor($10-49) = YOU will be appointed as the fiercest datu who has ever lived, much like the warrior chieftain who defeated Ferdinand Magellan at the Battle of Mactan in Cebu!
General Antonio Luna Sponsor ($50-299) = YOU are out right courageous for fighting along Samahan’s side in spreading our message! Hmm...sounds familiar.  Are you the Filipino general who led us in the Philippine-American War?
Apolinario Mabini Sponsor ($150-299) = Ang galing naman!  YOU are smart in supporting such a cause! You must be the “Brains of the Philippine Revolution” aren’t you?
Emilio Aguinaldo Sponsor  ($300-599) = YOU seem to fight what you believe in! Are you following in the footsteps of an admirable general who aided the Philippines in their independence? Maybe you should consider running in the next Philippine Presidential Election! Depending on which perk you've claimed (to the right side of page) you are guarenteed an x number of FREE TICKETS!
*Andres Bonifacio* Sponsor ($600 and above) = YOU will be revered as one of the most  highest and most venerable person in Andres Bonifacio Samahan. You’re strong heart is very much like those who fought alongside the Katipunan in their wish to free the Philippines from colonization. You should be declared a national hero!

<div>THEATER IN ASYLUM suspends beliefs and moralities through visceral, emotional and thrilling dance- theater to rigorously investigate our world and to believe again more wholly. We seek to create a world where theater experience is accessible, supported, and instrumental as a vibrant medium to explore and promote empathy. In the company’s first two years, it created five original stories for theater and produced cabarets which in total presented 37 new works by over a hundred young artists.<br/><br/>
</div>
<h2>The Project</h2>
<div>For its third season, THEATER IN ASYLUM was awarded a yearlong residency at Horse Trade Theater Group in the heart of the East Village theater scene. We will begin with a cycle of revolution (<em>Revolution in 1</em>), continue to the battle of two iconic artists (<em>¡Olé!</em>) and conclude with a Shakespearean whirlwind (<em>Coriolanus</em>) that pits populism versus elitism in post-war Rome. Through workshops, cabarets, and main-stage productions, with faces new and old, we will examine what has led us to become a nation ever at war: with other nations, with other people, with our lovers, and with ourselves.</div>

</div></div>","The
Who and the What?
 
NorteSur Artistic Productions in association with the
Quixotic Arts Collective is pleased to announce its involvement in the 2012
Hamilton Fringe Festival. We will be producing a play from one of the best in
British theatre. On July 19-29th, 2012 the stage is set and lights
are shining on Betrayal by Nobel
Laureate Harold Pinter. 
 
Since its creation in the 1970â€™s, this play has enjoyed
critical success around the world, it has been converted into a film staring
Ben Kinsley and Jeremy Irons and it has come to be regarded as one of Pinterâ€™s
seminal works.Loosely autobiographical in nature, this play uses sharp and
economical dialogue, Pinterâ€™s classic pauses, and highly manipulative uses of
memory to explore the many dimensions of betrayal, betraying and being
betrayed. What results is a poignant and raw examination of human relationships
and the subtle and crippling effects that often result when people are asked to
negotiate between their sense of right and wrong and their self-interest.
 
This play has a reverse chronology, it mostly moves backward
in time exposing us to selected moments in the lives of the characters as they
navigate through a 7-year affair. Face-saving, deceit, and strong sense of
fatalism are intensified through characters that never say what they mean.  
 
Why
this play?
We love this play. 
 
In September 2011, we put on a workshop production of this
play to prepare for the Fringe Festival. It was an absolute hit! People
responded positively, many of them saying that they enjoyed how real the
characters were, and how authentically they reacted.At the end of the day Betrayal
is about people being people. The characters are cryptic, self-interested, and
though their intentions might not be to harm, their choices often do. 
 
A great deal of this play is subtext. If you enjoy this play,
youâ€™ll enjoy discussing it with friends even more. Even the basic plot points
can be interpreted in different ways. This truly is a play where one could see
numerous productions throughout the years and see a completely different play
every time.
 
This play deals with real issues. People betray each other
every day and in many different ways. It is easy to hate the characters because
we see people we know in them. It is also easy to secretly relate to them
because most of us have been a Jerry, or a Robert or Emma at some point.   
 
Wait a minute, Harold Who?
Right!
I might have gotten a bit of a head of myself. Harold Pinter has been described
as one of the most influential British writers of the second half of the 20th
century. He is also the most copied.

Though
the list of awards is long, what is truly remarkable about Pinter is that you
know youâ€™re watching Pinter. Our author has one of the most unique voices in
modern theatre and one of the most unique writing styles. His voice is also one
of the most intelligent and subtle.

In a career that spanned over 50 years, Pinter received more
than 50 awards for his writing. These included the Nobel Prize in Literature in
2005 and the French LÃ©gion dâ€™honneur in 2007. His most famous plays are The
Birthday Party (1957), The Homecoming (1964), which some of you might remember from
the Stratford Festivals 2011 season, and Betrayal (1978).

offering some perks that we think will make sponsorship as mutually beneficial
as possible. Take a look to the side. 

Where is the money going?
You
deserve to know where your money will be spent and that it will be spent
effectively.The

<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Who Am I?:</span></h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">UC San Francisco-UC Berkeley Medical Anthropology PhD student with a multi-disciplinary background conducting my dissertation research, while combining it with my fascination with theatre.</span></h3>

<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Conducting dissertation research about women's decision-making process regarding sterilization in Brazil, as it relates to ideas about gender, sexuality, sex, reproduction, race and aesthetics.  But beyond writing articles and an ethnographic book about my year-long research findings, as is traditional, I will use theatre as a way to involve various communities in learning about and conveying the complex decision-making process women faced in the management of their fertility.</span></h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Where Am I Doing This?:</span></h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">The bulk of the research will take place in Salvador, Bahia in the Northeast of Brazil.  Because this is anthropological research, the research will take place in women's homes, during health fairs, during visits to buy contraceptives and other aspects of daily life as well as in libraries to collect archival data.  The theatre production will take place both in Brazil (Salvador) and in the United States (San Francisco, California).  More funding makes it possible to have more performances in different locations.</span></h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">When Am I Doing This?:</span></h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">This project is projected to take place over the next two years.  One year and a half will take place in Brazil while the latter half of the second year will take place in the United States.  The first year will be spent collecting the necessary data to use in creating the theatrical production.  The first six months after the completion of research will be spent developing the theatrical production and performing it at the end of the six month period.  The same will happen with the last six months in the United States (the six months may be less time, more like 15 weeks, similar to the semester system of most universities).</span></h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">How Am I Doing This?:</span></h3>
<h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Data collection will be done through anthropological research methods, </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">using semi-structured formal and informal interviews and participant observation to collect life histories and interviews from women (50 above the age of 18) and other influential people in their decision-making process (25 health professionals, local activists, NGO employees and family members).  Interviews and life histories will be transcribed for use in the theatrical production.</span>
</h3>
<h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">The theatrical production will be created through devised theatre (form of theatre where the script originates from collaborative work by a group of people, usually including the performers) using the anthropological and archival data collected.  Members of the various communities in Salvador, Bahia (and bay area residents when in the U.S.) and research participants will be recruited to participate in exploring the collected data, creating the script and performing the work.  The framework/basis for recruitment for participation in this part of the project will draw from Margaret Wilkerson's UC Berkeley Black Theater Workshop and Abdias do Nascimento's Teatro Experimental do Negro projects, which worked to introduce black students to theatre through producing it (Wilkerson), use theatre as a means to improve the quality of life of African Brazilians and serve as a forum for educating African Brazilians (Nascimento).  Thus emphasis for recruitment in the theatrical aspect of this project will be among non-professional (actors/performers), under-privileged, under-served and populations of color.  </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">  </span>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The desired impacts of this project are the following:</p>
<p>-To contribute new knowledge about sterilization, reproduction, sexuality, gender, race and aesthetics among women in Brazil.</p>
<p>-To provide women an opportunity to discuss their life histories and factors affecting their decisions about fertility.</p>
<p>-To provide an alternative and interactive way for members of the community (in particular, those that often do not have access to the results of such studies/research) to experience, learn from and impact research about them and their communities.</p>
<p>-To increase opportunities for exposure to theatre for communities that traditionally are excluded from access.</p>

<p>I was inspired to approach my research in this way after taking the black theater workshop class at UC Berkeley under Dr. Amma Ghartey-Tagoe Kootin.  Dr. Kootin's approach facilitated learning of her research material by both the performers and audience, inspired discussion and insights about the work and other issues raised by the performance and sparked reflection and dialogue.  With this work, I want to move and inspire people to tell theirs and others' stories through theatre.  Through my research and presenting it in this way, I also hope to encourage people to think more profoundly and differently about the entangled relationship between fertility, race, gender, sexuality, aesthetics and social movements as the issues concerning population and its link to the environment (climate change) resurface along with other underlying issues from the past (eugenics, genocide, racism, forced sterilizations, etc.).   </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $40,000 to cover the following costs:</p>
<p>Phase I (Research)</p>
<p>Costs for this phase include my travel to the research sites, visa fees, lodging, food and transportation within Brazil, access fees to archival materials, purchasing of books and other materials (photocopies, sound and video recording devices), payment for transcribers and research assistants and reimbursements for research participants (as part of ethical research, researchers try to minimize costs of participation in the research project through reimbursement when possible).  This is estimated to be $20,000-$22,000.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Phase II (Theatrical Production)</p>
<p>Costs for this phase include paying for theatre space in both Brazil and the United States, acquisition of props and costumes, local travel fees for performers/collaborators (as many will be from under-served communities), reimbursement of other expenses, fee payment for professional assistance (some may be needed for things like choreography, acting, etc), advertisement costs, videographers and photographers to document the process and final production and up-front costs to keep the performances free or low-cost.  It is desired to give a small and symbolic stipend to performers for their participation.  The cost of this is estimated to be $20,000.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All money raised will be used towards realizing this project.  Any amount truly will help to get my research project started and set the groundwork for future funding of the theatrical piece.  </p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Who Am I?:
UC San Francisco-UC Berkeley Medical Anthropology PhD student with a multi-disciplinary background conducting my dissertation research, while combining it with my fascination with theatre.
What Am I Doing?:
Conducting dissertation research about women's decision-making process regarding sterilization in Brazil, as it relates to ideas about gender, sexuality, sex, reproduction, race and aesthetics.  But beyond writing articles and an ethnographic book about my year-long research findings, as is traditional, I will use theatre as a way to involve various communities in learning about and conveying the complex decision-making process women faced in the management of their fertility.
Where Am I Doing This?:
The bulk of the research will take place in Salvador, Bahia in the Northeast of Brazil.  Because this is anthropological research, the research will take place in women's homes, during health fairs, during visits to buy contraceptives and other aspects of daily life as well as in libraries to collect archival data.  The theatre production will take place both in Brazil (Salvador) and in the United States (San Francisco, California).  More funding makes it possible to have more performances in different locations.
When Am I Doing This?:
This project is projected to take place over the next two years.  One year and a half will take place in Brazil while the latter half of the second year will take place in the United States.  The first year will be spent collecting the necessary data to use in creating the theatrical production.  The first six months after the completion of research will be spent developing the theatrical production and performing it at the end of the six month period.  The same will happen with the last six months in the United States (the six months may be less time, more like 15 weeks, similar to the semester system of most universities).
How Am I Doing This?:

Data collection will be done through anthropological research methods, using semi-structured formal and informal interviews and participant observation to collect life histories and interviews from women (50 above the age of 18) and other influential people in their decision-making process (25 health professionals, local activists, NGO employees and family members).  Interviews and life histories will be transcribed for use in the theatrical production.


The theatrical production will be created through devised theatre (form of theatre where the script originates from collaborative work by a group of people, usually including the performers) using the anthropological and archival data collected.  Members of the various communities in Salvador, Bahia (and bay area residents when in the U.S.) and research participants will be recruited to participate in exploring the collected data, creating the script and performing the work.  The framework/basis for recruitment for participation in this part of the project will draw from Margaret Wilkerson's UC Berkeley Black Theater Workshop and Abdias do Nascimento's Teatro Experimental do Negro projects, which worked to introduce black students to theatre through producing it (Wilkerson), use theatre as a means to improve the quality of life of African Brazilians and serve as a forum for educating African Brazilians (Nascimento).  Thus emphasis for recruitment in the theatrical aspect of this project will be among non-professional (actors/performers), under-privileged, under-served and populations of color.    


The Impact
The desired impacts of this project are the following:
-To contribute new knowledge about sterilization, reproduction, sexuality, gender, race and aesthetics among women in Brazil.
-To provide women an opportunity to discuss their life histories and factors affecting their decisions about fertility.
-To provide an alternative and interactive way for members of the community (in particular, those that often do not have access to the results of such studies/research) to experience, learn from and impact research about them and their communities.
-To increase opportunities for exposure to theatre for communities that traditionally are excluded from access.
-To use alternative methods to present research and reach a more broad and diverse audience.

I was inspired to approach my research in this way after taking the black theater workshop class at UC Berkeley under Dr. Amma Ghartey-Tagoe Kootin.  Dr. Kootin's approach facilitated learning of her research material by both the performers and audience, inspired discussion and insights about the work and other issues raised by the performance and sparked reflection and dialogue.  With this work, I want to move and inspire people to tell theirs and others' stories through theatre.  Through my research and presenting it in this way, I also hope to encourage people to think more profoundly and differently about the entangled relationship between fertility, race, gender, sexuality, aesthetics and social movements as the issues concerning population and its link to the environment (climate change) resurface along with other underlying issues from the past (eugenics, genocide, racism, forced sterilizations, etc.).   


What We Need & What You Get
My goal is to raise $40,000 to cover the following costs:
Phase I (Research)

Phase II (Theatrical Production)
Costs for this phase include paying for theatre space in both Brazil and the United States, acquisition of props and costumes, local travel fees for performers/collaborators (as many will be from under-served communities), reimbursement of other expenses, fee payment for professional assistance (some may be needed for things like choreography, acting, etc), advertisement costs, videographers and photographers to document the process and final production and up-front costs to keep the performances free or low-cost.  It is desired to give a small and symbolic stipend to performers for their participation.  The cost of this is estimated to be $20,000.

All money raised will be used towards realizing this project.  Any amount truly will help to get my research project started and set the groundwork for future funding of the theatrical piece.

<p>Keeping Live Theatre ALIVE</p>
<p>Since the ongoing COVID-19 crisis began at the start of 2020, the Social Distancing Players have been producing online shows for unemployed actors from theatre and renaissance festivals, joined by enthusiastic patrons who want to get in on the fun and help support us until our industry is back up and running. Titus Andronicus: Ya Know — For Kids!, is the 9th show in our series, and our 8th original work with audience interaction, and we hope that you'll be a part of it!</p>
<p>Each show is fully funded by Indiegogo campaigns - that is, by folks like you helping to keep live theatre alive. The hoped-for minimum goal for each show is at least $100 per professional actor - and so we're hoping to raise a minimum of $700 for this show. The proceeds will be evenly distributed amongst the performers, and after each actor gets at least $100, then we can put some money towards the next show.</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>The Social Distancing Theatre project is here to not just keep performers semi-quasi-gainfully employed, but to keep us connected with our audiences. You're missing the shows just as much as we miss performing them for you live and in-person. The money raised goes to help each performer do the little things: like pay their bills. So every bit you give helps a whole lot.</p>
<p>Perks</p>
<p>We're not asking you to give just because you're nice (although we're sure that you are!) - we want you to get something in return, beyond the quality entertainment that we're bringing.</p>
<p>For $10, you get a backstage pass! You get to hang out with the actors after the show during the cast party!</p>
<p>For $30, you ALSO get a signed copy of the performance script! This will be mailed to you in early November.</p>
<p>For $50, you can ALSO have a part of in the show! See your name in lights and tell your friends that they HAVE to watch the show! First come, first served on this perk.</p>
<p>For $100 or more, you get all of the above PLUS a personalized sonnet written just for you! Shakespeare wrote sonnets, and so does the guy who plays him at renaissance faires!</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. We need you to tune in on Wednesday, October 28th at 7:05 pm EDT and watch the show! And share the show with your friends! And share this link to get your friends, family - even enemies! - just everyone you know to potentially contribute. </p>
<p>After all, we're all in this together.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h3>Help us ""SOW"" our roots!</h3>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>We are Los Angeles-based MaiM Theatre company (run by director Nathan Singh and playwright Julie Taiwo Oni), and we are gearing up to present a production of our new play SOWN in collaboration with Son of Semele Ensemble this summer (August - September 2019).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561481128/l5q2bzuuz1hvmgsf5jgt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
<p>Jones and Zora, young Black homeowners, find themselves at odds with their middle-class community when they decide to confront a strict American-only policy by planting a native African violet. While they initially defend this blatant infiltration of a monolithic landscape, a cycle of push-back and copy-cats eventually entangles them in madness. They must decide if they wish to stand up for the roots they’ve sown, or tear them down to maintain the status quo. This story explores the nightmare of contemporary segregation by placing its audience into a middle-class living-room-turned-battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>The Team:</strong></p>
<p>We've got two phenomenal LA actors, Joshua Michael Moore and Victoria Allen, for the roles of Jones and Zora, and we've been fortunate enough to have them onboard throughout the script development process as well. Julie has also been conducting research with the AVSA (African Violet Society of America)'s Thousand Oaks chapter and a local florist for both script development and design and character inspiration. We're rounding out our team with some other local artists of color to make a community invested in authentic storytelling of the marginalized.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561479000/hoatq2kkeblmxohlcwm5.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561479059/dql7bnekz5ovpqsce05m.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why This Piece Now:</strong></p>
<p>We're living at a tense moment in current America. Families are being torn apart, citizens are killing and hurting each other, and in particular, people of color face serious obstacles in the effort to better ourselves among the chaos. Tackling these issues is at the heart of MaiM Theatre Company's mission.</p>
<p>We believe that storytelling, and theatre specifically, is a vital cultural practice that has the power to both reflect society's struggles and humanize the supposed other to show our commonalities. SOWN's setting is in the not-too-distant future, and its chaos is something that we imagine could become our reality if we don't wake up to the rampant fear of otherness across the country and recognize what joins us as human beings. </p>
<p>We see SOWN as not just a play, but a conversation and a source for engagement. To that end, the production itself will include much community involvement, from post-show conversations on cultural ownership, assimilation, and the American Dream with the team, to dialogues on black botany and its rarity within the culture and what that means in our current state, to engagement with the plant life of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The joy of theatre is that it takes a community to make it work, and we are hoping that our community will join us in supporting this piece of provocation and hope for betterment. We are intent on compensating the amazing artists who are helping us put this piece together, and we need your support!</p>

We feel that artists, particularly those of color, are too often encouraged to work for free, and we refuse to continue this cycle.

The Impact

We are hoping that MaiM will inspire a much-needed conversation about embracement of diversity and providing opportunities for all types of people to live comfortably here and be proud to call America home.

We collaborated with a South African script consultant, and preparation included a team visit to the actual location of the story in Bakersfield, Julie's hometown.

Most recently, Nathan and Julie organized a reading of Julie's play CHISEL at Pepperdine University last summer for Albinism Awareness Day. CHISEL is another play that deals with Julie's mission of placing America in conversation with Africa, and its specific premise is based in the rampant killings and attacks on albinos in Tanzania. The result was a HowlRound piece Julie wrote on her endless search for an actor with albinism and the need for authentic casting in contemporary theatre.

With some strong successes under our belt, this is our first fully independent production, so community support is even more necessary. If you've seen our work, then you know that we are committed to provocative theatre and supporting the ostracized. We hope you'll join us in this mission!

The regions of Punjab and Bengal were physically divided between the newly created Pakistan and India. Despite coping with hardship, conflict, or a divisive history, many who left their ancestral home have created new lives, found peace, and have even thrived. Their journeys inspired the title, “Broken Seeds Still Grow.” Using these interviews we can contextualize the experiences of our ancestors to help us find our way today. By supporting this project, you not only support the creation of this work but you also give audiences an opportunity to engage, understand, and share the real-life stories from the <a href=""http://www.1947partitionarchive.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>1947 Partition Archive</strong></a> that we feature. </p><p>Post 9/11 and more recently after the last presidential election, the political climate as facilitated hateful rhetoric towards cultural or religious minority groups. This has corresponded to an increase in the number of hate crimes specifically towards those of either South Asian or Middle Eastern descent, or anyone perceived to be Muslim. We want the voices of these struggles to be heard.  We believe this project can create a unique space for a larger discourse on how both internal personal prejudices and openly hateful rhetoric can affect the community at large. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Our biggest challenge is integrating dance and visual art. However, we have set ourselves up to make interesting interactions between the art forms, given that we are working with consultants and experts who have done this before. Before we even discussed this project, we had already started discussing how art and dance could interact, purely based on our genuine interest in each others work. We don't see it as daunting, we see this collaboration as an exciting way to intersect two traditional forms to tell contemporary stories. Oh and we meet in person weekly (often more than once a week) and we text and phone about this project constantly. And we voluntarily hang out on weekends.</p><p>One of our other challenges is that our music composer is based in Atlanta.  But, we meet for week-long residencies twice throughout the year to develop the music. This was similar to our approach when we were composing for The Cloud Messenger, so we are confident in our ability to complete the score for this project. We have budgeted appropriately for travel to accommodate this challenge. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>We hope you can contribute to this project, and if you are not in a position to contribute financially right now, then we hope you can contribute by making noise about the project via facebook, instagram, snapchat - whatever platform you use. E-mail, text, phone calls – any of it works for us! Use the share options made available to you from the indiegogo campaign page, and let us know if you have any questions on how to spread the word.</p><p>We are counting on your support.

Your funds would support his time and any equipment he would need to rent to for the cues we want to build.Sound Engineer: We have 5 wonderful musicians playing in this show, and to make that work with some of the video and sound we are designing, we have a dedicated sound engineer who has worked within the scope of live music for bharatanatyam before. He is hardworking, positive, and committed - we are so excited to work with our sound person again.Dramaturge: Since we are telling a number of different stories, we feel that it is important to storyboard and discuss the direction of these pieces with a creative consultant. The collaborator we are working with has worked on dance theatre pieces inspired by diaspora, displacement, and lack of homeland in the past, and we feel this collaborator's viewpoints would be essential in developing the arc of this work.Additionally, your funds will support documentation, which includes film and photography to preserve and share the work once the show is over. Lastly, since these funds are raised through CounterPulse, our fiscal sponsor, a small portion (10%) of what is raised here goes to them to help them continue to support our work.We have been awarded funds through the Zellerbach Family Foundation and CA$H Grants to support a majority of the artist fees for dancers and musicians. Additional expenses such as studio time, music composition, and costumes will be covered through ticket sales.What You GetVirtual shout-outs, recognition on our website or our program, beautiful fine arts prints created by Rupy from her Marble Garden Collection, tickets to the show, artist meet-and-greet, and sponsorship credit to major parts of the production. The perks are endless. (You can also donate a perk of your own!)Background and Impact The 1947 Partition was one of the most formative events in the recent South Asian history, creating over 15 million refugees and resulted in the death of over one million people. The regions of Punjab and Bengal were physically divided between the newly created Pakistan and India. Despite coping with hardship, conflict, or a divisive history, many who left their ancestral home have created new lives, found peace, and have even thrived. Their journeys inspired the title, “Broken Seeds Still Grow.” Using these interviews we can contextualize the experiences of our ancestors to help us find our way today. By supporting this project, you not only support the creation of this work but you also give audiences an opportunity to engage, understand, and share the real-life stories from the 1947 Partition Archive that we feature. Post 9/11 and more recently after the last presidential election, the political climate as facilitated hateful rhetoric towards cultural or religious minority groups. This has corresponded to an increase in the number of hate crimes specifically towards those of either South Asian or Middle Eastern descent, or anyone perceived to be Muslim. We want the voices of these struggles to be heard.  We believe this project can create a unique space for a larger discourse on how both internal personal prejudices and openly hateful rhetoric can affect the community at large. Risks & ChallengesOur biggest challenge is integrating dance and visual art. However, we have set ourselves up to make interesting interactions between the art forms, given that we are working with consultants and experts who have done this before. Before we even discussed this project, we had already started discussing how art and dance could interact, purely based on our genuine interest in each others work. We don't see it as daunting, we see this collaboration as an exciting way to intersect two traditional forms to tell contemporary stories. Oh and we meet in person weekly (often more than once a week) and we text and phone about this project constantly. And we voluntarily hang out on weekends.One of our other challenges is that our music composer is based in Atlanta.  But, we meet for week-long residencies twice throughout the year to develop the music. This was similar to our approach when we were composing for The Cloud Messenger, so we are confident in our ability to complete the score for this project. We have budgeted appropriately for travel to accommodate this challenge. Other Ways You Can HelpWe hope you can contribute to this project, and if you are not in a position to contribute financially right now, then we hope you can contribute by making noise about the project via facebook, instagram, snapchat - whatever platform you use.

<h3>What is Lighthouse Triptych?</h3>
<p>Hi! We are: <strong>Stephanie Lane</strong> (choreographer, performer, adapter), <strong>Mark Van Hare</strong> (composer, sound-designer), <strong>Jamie Watkins</strong> (director), <strong>Kyle Gerry</strong> (performer), and <strong>Mackenzie Jahnke</strong> (performer), and we've come together for the latest iteration of <strong>Lighthouse Triptych</strong>, to be performed as part of <a href=""http://www.bricktheater.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Brick Theater's</a> Sound Scape Festival this June in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  </p>
<p><strong>Lighthouse Triptych</strong> is a dance, theater, and music collaboration inspired by Virginia Woolf's modernist novel, <em>To the Lighthouse</em>.  </p>
<p>To make this show, we're working together in the unique space where sound, dance, and acting overlap.  Stephanie's script takes place in three acts.  Under Jamie's direction, each act is stylistically distinct.  Mark Van Hare's sound design and score create a rich aural environment, which, along with Stephanie's choreography, communicate the complextity of Woolf's ideas non-verbally.   We're digging into to the gnarly themes in the novel - the passage of time, chaos versus control, and familial love.  </p>
<h3>Where did it begin, where is it going?</h3>
<p>The show began back in 2009 as Part I, ""The Dinner Scene,"" Stephanie Lane's senior thesis at Barnard College.  After performing it in New York, Brooklyn, and Shanghai, Stephanie worked with actress Devon Werden, dancer Kyle Gerry, and composer Mark Van Hare to develop the show into a three-part, evening-length work which had its workshop premiere at Dixon Place in downtown Manhattan in January, 2013.  </p>
<p>Happily for all of us, Williamsburg's The Brick Theater has recently chosen <strong>Lighthouse Triptych</strong> for their sound-design focused festival, <a href=""http://www.bricktheater.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sound Scape</a>, for five performances in June (see below).  We've been working hard in the rehearsal and editing rooms to get the show ready for its premiere, but we need your help to take us all the way!</p>
<p>As a funder for this project, you make it possible for us to explore the potential of Woolf's writing for the stage, to bring it to audiences, and to continue experimenting in the exciting space where dance, theater, and music overlap.  </p>
<p><em>Our performance as The Brick will be: </em></p>
<p>Saturday 6/8       5pm</p>

<p>Dance Generators has been lucky to have wonderful performance venues and support from producers throughout their first fifteen years. Originally artists-in-residence at A.P.E. in Thornes Marketplace, Northampton, the Dance Generators were taken in by  Northampton Center for the Arts after the A.P.E. space was sold.   Now that Center for the Arts has lost its space, the DG are on their own to produce their home season this year.  This greatly increases our financial burden as well as our administrative responsibilities. The company has made arrangements to rent the beautiful Kendall Studio Theater at Mt. Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA.  But, in order to deal with the added expenses of self-producing in this space, we need to raise several thousand dollars. </p>
<p>As local performance venues disappear, we need your support more than ever to keep making our work and making a difference in our community.  Throughout the year, the Dance Generators offer a vigorous community outreach program, performing across the Pioneer Valley in schools, senior homes, libraries and community centers.  Once a year, we return to a traditional theater space to do a fully produced show with lights, costumes, sets, props, etc., allowing us to deepen the artistic integrity of our work. </p>
<p>The Dance Generators 2013 concert will premier new works by DG Artistic Director Kristin Horrigan and by guest artists Fritha Pengally, Jen Polins, and Maureen Shea.  The company will be joined on stage by the Da Camera Singers, a 40 member adult choir based in Amherst, MA, and the Dolphin Dancers, a children’s dance company based in Cummington, MA. </p>

One Last Thing hopes to show people that there is no such thing as shame, or isolation; that no, it is ‘not just you’ that feels the way you do, and we believe that spoken word poetry has the power to do this. Spoken word plays especially, have the power to access the raw, complicated humanity of an audience in a way which we believe other forms do not. Thanks to artists such as Kate Tempest, Katie Bonna and Richard Marsh, spoken word plays are becoming recognised as an important and exciting theatrical form. We hope to contribute the growth of this form, while helping one of the most inspirational young artists at the moment access as wide an audience as possible. The Edinburgh Fringe is, we believe, the best platform for this: it attracts attention from audiences and critics alike on a scale unmatched by any other theatrical event in the world.</span></p>

Vanessa Kisuule is one of the UK's most exciting, and outrageously talented, emerging spoken word artists. She has won several awards for her work, including Slambassadors 2010, Hammer and Tongue Slam, Poetry Rivals 2011 and most recently Sabotage Review's Best Spoken Word Poet. Vanessa has performed at festivals such as Glastonbury and Secret Garden Party and has supported the likes of Kate Tempest, Dizraeli and Linton Kwesi Johnson to name but a few. 
 
‘Kanye West should take... her wit and use it for his live show.’ Charlotte Morgan Nokwenna, Poejazzi
 
‘Vanessa Kisuule is the best performance poet in the UK.' Dan Holloway The Guardian
 
At the beginning of 2013, Vanessa teamed up with Hannah Horan, Elana Binysh and Annie Bell to form Whispers&Shouts. We are a theatre company who create experimental theatre combining spoken word poetry, physical theatre and traditional playwriting. The result is eloquently explosive performance that cuts straight to the core of what it is to feel.
 
Whispers&Shouts was formed in order to produce Vanessa's first full length spoken word play, One Last Thing, which was such a success in it's first run, in Bristol, that we now plan to tour it to Brainchild festival in Canterbury and to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
 

""We’re not alone. Not as long as words are coming out of your mouth, and they’re going into people’s ears or maybe even people’s hearts and not falling into the cracks in the pavement or the gaps between the stars.""- One Last Thing
 
One Last Thing is an anthology of words you wish you'd said, things you couldn't express and moments that passed you by. It allows its audience momentary insights into the lives of a series of characters: a battered housewife, eternally on the brink of escaping; a little girl saying goodbye forever to her imaginary friends; and two teenagers who find a sort of love over miniature quiches and accidental murder. If you have ever regretted not saying something, or wished you could have said it better, this show is for you. In One Last Thing, the things we cannot say flow from the characters’ mouths as perfectly formed poetry.
 
“In a word, phenomenal...impressive in its ability to 'ring true in all of us'”. (Inter:mission Bristol, Bristol's online arts magazine)
 
""One Last Thing is nothing short of inspirational"" Harry Baker, European Slam Champion 
 
We believe in the redemptive power of spoken word, and what performing and creating spoken word can do for our society. In a world where we have more mediums than ever to express ourselves, true unvarnished honesty seems to be ever more elusive. One Last Thing hopes to show people that there is no such thing as shame, or isolation; that no, it is ‘not just you’ that feels the way you do, and we believe that spoken word poetry has the power to do this. Spoken word plays especially, have the power to access the raw, complicated humanity of an audience in a way which we believe other forms do not. Thanks to artists such as Kate Tempest, Katie Bonna and Richard Marsh, spoken word plays are becoming recognised as an important and exciting theatrical form. We hope to contribute the growth of this form, while helping one of the most inspirational young artists at the moment access as wide an audience as possible. The Edinburgh Fringe is, we believe, the best platform for this: it attracts attention from audiences and critics alike on a scale unmatched by any other theatrical event in the world.
 

 http://www.whispersandshouts.webuda.com/
 
Our production team, Whispers&Shouts consists of Elana Binysh, Hannah Horan and Annie Bell. Here's a bit about them all:
Annie Bell: Annie is a theatre producer who has worked on a number of productions (eight in the last year!), ranging from a large scale production of King Lear, which was shown in Bristol and London, to smaller scale shows such as The Honeymoon Suite, which was set in a beautifully accurate recreation of a 1950's hotel room. Most recently, she has worked with Bristol-based company MAYK on Mayfest, one of the UK's most exciting theatre festivals. She will continue to work with MAYK later this year. Annie likes theatre. Lots of theatre, but especially theatre that is energetic, experimental, honest, and leaves her breathless. (She also likes tea, bikes, and videos of baby sloths).
 
Elana Binysh: Elana is a theatre producer and costume designer with a passion for collaborative theatre. After having worked extensively in costume- large scale productions of Honeymoon Suite, The Tempest, Festen and Metamorphosis as highlights- she has moved on to focus on producing. In the past three months she has worked on a Bristol based production of Look Back in Anger, as well as a new piece of Verbatim Theatre in association with the charity STAR, discussing the case for Asylum Seekers in Britain. In the past year she has volunteered for You Me Bum Bum Train and Mayfest, as well as working at C Venues in Edinburgh, cemementing her love of immersive, vibrant productions. These experiences have left her convinced that anyone who says theatre is a dying art form is an idiot- they clearly just haven't been to the right play yet.
 
Hannah Horan: Hannah is a theatre-type who has dabbled in the art of directing, producing and even stage managing; most notably directing small-scale Bristol-based productions, producing shows for sketch comedy troupe Bristol Revunions and a large-scale Theatre Uncut, plus stage managing for a hugely successful production of ‘The Cracks in My Skin’. She has also had much experience in organising open mic nights and encouraging new talent, whilst trying her hand (arguably successfully) at stand up and compering. Hannah believes that theatre should get noises out of you that nothing else ever will. 

Everything we raise here will go towards the Edinburgh run of One Last Thing,for which our budget breakdown looks like this:
 
Props & Costume: £95.20
 
Insurance: £123.00
 
Posters: £120.00

Other marketing: £300
 
Edfringe fee: £393.60
 
Sweet Venues (venue hire): £537.60
 
Sweet Venues (marketing): £140
 
Total: £1926.90
 
As well as our online campaign, we will be raising the money we need through a variety of means, including the proceeds of another of our shows, Flesh, a one woman spoken word play which is currently on at Smoke and Mirrors in Bristol. It is incredibly good, if we say so ourselves, so if you are in the Bristol area, check it out!

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>seat of your pants Productions has been producing low budget, high quality plays since 1997 in the southern California area. We have staged original and established works. We have helped new actors, designers, directors, and playwrights get a chance to show their talents.</p>
<p>In 2002, we staged a production of Irvine Welsh's TRAINSPOTTING which garnered rave reviews from such periodicals as the LA Weekly, Backstage, Entertainment Today, the Ventura Star, the Hollywood Reporter, and the Los Angeles Times, which also gave us a top ten pick of the year.</p>
<p>The show, which revolves around a group of Scottish heroin addicts, isn't just about drugs, but about the choices people make in their lives to escape their misery and the consequences of those actions. The play is filled with humor and drama and is not for the faint of heart. </p>
<div>
<p>This show was one of the most impactful that seat of your pants Productions has done, affecting most everyone who saw it. We received praise from the likes of KEVIN SPACEY, who saw it three times, Academy Award winning screenwriter and director STEPHEN GAGHAN called it an amazing piece of theatre. </p>
<p>But the biggest praise I feel we received came from an older couple who read a review of it and drove an hour and a half to see it. After the show they thanked us for staging the show. Their son had died of a drug overdose a few years earlier and they never understood why, as he was taken care of, educated, and loved. The show helped give them some answers and some closure.</p>
<p>We know the power the show has and want to spread that message again and with your help, we will be able to do that.</p>
<p>We tried for several years to get this show to a New York venue, but for a number of reasons, (including a previously staged production of TRAINSPOTTING that was not well-received) we had no luck in finding the backing that would get us into the Big Apple (we found it would cost us anywhere between $100,000 - $800,000 to do it in an Off-Off Broadway theater).</p>
</div>
<p>Several of the cast wanted to do a revival and take another stab at seeing if we could move this show to bigger and better things. They are coming back to help with this production and knowing our resources in Los Angeles can allow us to do this at a much more reasonable $20,000 budget for a six week run that we hope to entice producers into seeing.</p>
<p>Your help with our play can get a little show onto a larger market and see a small show reach the big lights of Broadway. </p>
<p>seat of your pants Productions also recently was granted its 501(c)(3) status as a non-profit and so your contribution is also tax deductible!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have raised $10,000 on our own and we are looking to raise another $10,000 through IndieGoGo.</p>
<p>Most of the money that is used for a theatre production goes into the cost of the theater (around $9000 for the venue we found for a six week run). But a show has som many more expenses to make it work: the rights for the play, rehearsal space, lights, sets, costumes, props... and to take it to the next level takes money. So, we need help, </p>
<p>On top of getting the chance to be part of an award winning show looking to go to Broadway, we will be offering a number of other perks:</p>

<h3>The Who:</h3>
<p>We are <strong>Infinite Jest Theatre Company</strong>, Los Angeles' only all comedic theatre company and we are brand <em><strong>new</strong></em>! Founded in late 2012, our members are all talented artists, primarily with theatre backgrounds. We believe that theatre should be accessible to all and is an integral part of a well-rounded society and, whatsmore, we believe that making people laugh is good, noble work that will make the world a better place, so putting our skills to work cracking jokes, making faces, talking in funny voices, and pratfalling while taking pies to the face seemed the way to go.</p>
<p>We are planning our inaugural season for 2014 and we want to do it right! This campaign is to help us fund that key first season and lay the foundation for Infinite Jest to make people giggle, chuckle, guffaw, and cackle for years to come and by donating even just a dollar, you will be helping us do just that.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The What:</h3>
<p>We are looking for your help producing our inaugural 2 show season. Our plan is to produce the hilarious new whodunnit, HAPPY NO YEAR, by company member Jon Christie as well as John Cariani's quirky collection of romantic comedy one acts set in the fictitious town of ALMOST, MAINE.</p>
<p>Making theatre is <em><strong>expensive</strong></em> and we're poor. Making <em><strong>great</strong></em> theatre is even more expensive and we are still poor. Your contribution will be going towards helping us produce a successful first season. Things like rental fees, marketing expenses, obtaining our 501(c)3 non-profit status, paying our artists (directors, designers, <em><strong>even actors</strong></em>!), costumes, props, sets, performance rights, etc. A sample of the fees we're looking at: $75/performance (rights) = $900/show for 12 performances; $75-100/night for rehearsal = $1875-2500 for 25 rehearsals per show; $850 for 501(c)3 filing; $250 marketing expenses per show, average $300/night for performance (theater rental) = $3600/show for 12 performances, etc, etc. You see how it all adds up? And every fiver, ducat, greenback, sawbuck, and tenner you can afford to contribute will help us immensely!</p>
<p>But nobody wants something for nothing, right? Which is why we are planning some <em><strong>fun</strong></em> and <em><strong>fabulous</strong></em> perks for our donors. First, you'll get the heartwarming knowledge that <strong>YOU</strong> are a patron of the arts! A case of the warm fuzzies not enough? Don't worry! We'll also be giving shout outs on Facebook and Twitter, so the world can hear of your good deeds. We'll be sending out personalized thank you letters, magnets, t-shirts, tickets to one of our shows or all three, exclusive invites to post-show receptions with company and cast members, reserved seating at performances, and more! It is important to us that you know we appreciate you and what you are doing for us, so thank you, thank you, thank you!!! And if you are not local to LA, don't worry, we will make substitutions to your perks so even if you can't come join us for a performance you can still share in the laughs.</p>
<p>One teeny, tiny little thing...As wonderful as Indiegogo is, if we don't meet our fundraising goal, they'll take more money out of our pocket. That's right! Their cut goes from 4% to 9%, so keep that in mind. We need as much money in our pocket as possible in order to make Infinite Jest a success and we know you want as much of your money as possible to do as much good as possible, so let's make that goal!</p>

    The Impact 
I believe art always makes the world a better place. Whether it brings beauty, allows self expression, or makes people think. Our project is an artistic endeavor we wish to share far and wide. For me this venture is an attempt to further explore what dance is and what it means. 
As a choreographer, I have set works on the student company at Oakland University three times. I am about to start working on another one for them along with the piece for Berlin and the piece for my Senior Showcase. 

I cannot promise that you will like or enjoy what we create. The nature of the process I will be using with this piece is one that is a little unpredictable.

<p><b>What is Theatre 68?</b></p>
<p>Theatre 68 and the 68 Cent Crew
Theatre Company is a community dedicated to assisting actors, writers,
directors, and producers in the realization of their creative and professional
identity through the interpretation of the written word.</p>
<p>The theatre company is committed
to building character, cultivating high self-esteem, and facilitating positive
social change through artistic excellence and professional
transformation. </p>
<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>After leaving New York, our
artistic director, Ronnie Marmo, had some initial success in Hollywood.<span>  But he quickly found himself lonely, lost and
wishing he had a community of people who shared the same values and passion. Thus,
the 68 Cent Crew Theatre Company began, with five members rehearsing scenes in
a living room.  </span></p>
<p>Other theatre companies focus
mainly on putting up productions.<span>  But the
68 Cent Crew Theatre Company is about nurturing artists and exposing them to
all aspects of the business so they can find their voice and discover who they
are as an artist.  We believe that if you
feel loved, supported and respected you will do your best work.  And we have done some amazing work!  </span></p>
<p>Over the
past 15 years, Theatre 68 has produced over ninety plays between the Los
Angeles and the New York City chapters including:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>The
critically acclaimed <b><i>Bill W. and Dr. Bob</i></b>, which has enjoyed 350+
sold out performances.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>World
Premiere of the musical <b>Serial Killer Barbie</b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>World
Premiere of <b><i>86’d</i></b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>First-ever
<b><i>13 by Shanley Festival (John Patrick Shanley)</i></b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>World
Premiere of John Patrick Shanley's <b><i>Last Night In The Garden I Saw You </i></b><i>and
</i>the Los Angeles Premiere of Shanley’s <b>Storefront Church.</b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Los
Angeles Premiere of Sam Shepard's <b><i>The Late Henry Moss</i></b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>40th
Anniversary production of <b><i>Lovers and Other Strangers,</i></b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Nominated
by the <b><i>NAACP Awards </i></b>for the productions of <b><i>The Knights of
Mary Phagan </i></b>and <b><i>Subway Series </i></b><span>and, most recently</span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Won BEST
PLAY 2015<b><i> – Connect – </i></b>Valley Theatre Awards.</p>
<p>All this magic took place at
Theatre 68, a carpet warehouse converted into a beautiful 99 seat theatre,
where we resided for ten years.<span> 
Unfortunately, the building was sold, and we have been looking for a
new, permanent home for the past three years. </span></p>
<p>We're happy to announce that
we've finally found a new space, and we're moving in August!<span>  Once again, we plan to put our blood, sweat
and tears into building a place where our company can continue to grow and
support each other, while also bringing amazing art to the community.</span></p>
<p><b>Theatre 68’s New Home</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you've ever seen a show at the
Antaeus Theatre (formerly Deaf West Theatre) in North Hollywood, you'll know
what a beautiful theatre it is.<span>  And we
are incredibly grateful to be able to say that it is to be the new home of
Theatre 68.  Located a mere block from the
Noho Arts Center, we will continue to be in the hustle and bustle of the Noho
Arts District, only now we'll be in a bigger and more beautiful space of our
very own.</span></p>
<p>Of course, that's not enough for
our visionary Artistic Director Ronnie Marmo. Ronnie has some big ideas, which
will make the space even better! The
plans include new bathrooms, dressing rooms, a master lobby, and (this is the
best part) a SECOND THEATRE SPACE where we can foster more creativity, create
and produce more art, and contribute more nightlife and commerce to the
surrounding community. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can’t possibly
do this alone. We, the members of the 68 Cent Crew, have time, energy, and
initiative; what we don't have is MOOLAH, which we have to have to build a
brand new shiny Theatre 68.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>Listen... we know we need a
lot.<span>  Our total goal is to raise $40,000
through a three-tiered fundraising campaign: 
Indiegogo, and Opening Gala. </span></p>
<p>The $40,000 will cover the
following expenses:</p>
<p>Demolition &amp; Removal:<span>    $4000.00</span></p>
<p>Framing:<span>  $3500.00</span></p>
<p>Plumbing:<span>  $5000.00</span></p>

<p>Marquee:<span>  $5000.00</span></p>
<p>Contingency Fund:<span>  $4500.00</span></p>
<p><b>In order to succeed, we need to meet our first fundraising goal</b><b>of</b><b> $17,500.00 with this
INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN! </b></p>
<p><b>This amount will get us all the way through finishing the
electrical, and well on our way to completion!</b></p>
<p><b>What We Give</b></p>
<p>Theatre 68 has so much to offer,
not just to our members, but also to the local community and beyond.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Theatre 68 is committed to
exposing our members to all aspects of the entertainment world.<span>  Through our productions, our members not only
get to act, but they also get opportunities to work on their writing, directing
and producing.  Our members enjoy two
writing assignments every year where they write a one-act play that is
ultimately produced.  Many of our members
who had never written before have gone on to be prolific and successful
writers!  We participate in monologue
jams, directing workshops, and have a weekly “gym” where everybody gets to work
on improv, cold reading, audition techniques and prepared scenes, and they
receive constructive feedback from their peers. In this new space, with two
theatres and a rehearsal space, we will have even more opportunities for our
members!</span></p>
<p>In addition, the new space is set
to have a Play/Book Store where the community can come to purchase plays, and a
trained employee will be on site to help people select scenes and
monologues.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Our company is dedicated to
producing socially conscious material, such as the current run of “Bill W and
Dr. Bob.”<span>  We also are involved with
various philanthropies including Habitat For Humanity, Fans In The Stands for
the Special Olympics, and the Sharing The Spirit Holiday Party with the
Festival of Children.  </span></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to everything we just
mentioned, our company offers something else to our members, which is not as
tangible, but is possibly even more important.<span> 
Theatre 68 has, from it’s inception, provided a safe place for people,
and has given a community, a home, and a family to people who are otherwise
trudging through this often difficult business alone.  We work on our craft and grow and learn
together, which is something that is hard to come by in this crazy
business.  Our members who have made the
theatre their home and family, the theatre-goers who have enjoyed our
productions for the past fifteen years, and the greater community that has
benefited from our contributions to the arts and humanities, ALL will all be
positively impacted by this new theatre space. 
By helping us build our new home, you are really helping artists,
supporting live theatre in L.A., and helping our community!</span></p>

</h3>
<p>I am a professional belly dance and fusion artist based in Austin, Texas with a dance career spanning more than 30 years and numerous productions. <br/></p>
<p>On October 24 &amp; 25, 2014, I will be presenting an extraordinary dance production titled <i>""Ode to the Elements Forever</i>"" at the Vortex Repertory Company Theatre in Austin. This production is a revival based on original music and dance from a previous production I did 25 years ago titled <i>""Ode to the Elements</i>."" This rendition will have a company of 21 dancers and 5 musicians.  It will be a theatrical,  joyous, and deeply-moving performance experience for dance, art and music fans near and far. <br/></p>
<p>A dear friend once told me,""Helene, when you get a wild hair, you really get a wild hair and follow through!"" While in my dance studio in March of this year, I realized how much I wanted to bring this show back to the stage with the same concepts but presented in new ways. Art evolves and I want to reflect that evolution.  The response from performers who wanted to share in my vision was absolutely overwhelming! So onward I march and I would be honored and humbled to have your support in bringing this performing arts vision back to the stage. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>A Few Words From the Producer</h3>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F7stmGGNG5cE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7stmGGNG5cE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F7stmGGNG5cE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<h3>The Elements of ""Elements""<br/>
</h3>
<p>The original production had a cast of dancers, but a large part of the show was my own solo performances. In this new incarnation,<i> </i>I turn my previous solos into large ensemble choreography pieces.  I will be personally presenting a vibrant, high energy solo in which I 
reprise movement from my 37 year career as a dancer and choreographer.<br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3>Vintage Music... <br/>
</h3>
<p>Side A of our original music ""cassette"" (also called <i>""Ode to the Elements</i>"") is used for a choreography suite that explores and honors the Five Elements of Earth, Air, Water, Fire and Spirit. <br/></p>
<p>Side B is another large ensemble choreography called <i>""Persephone's Ascent</i>."" This piece reinterprets the ancient Greek myth of the goddess Persephone and her struggle with Demeter and Hades. </p>
<p>The final section of the show will be live with dancers and musicians creatively coming together to express the Elements and the connection that we have with ourselves, each other, and our planet.  </p>
<p>Rehearsals so far have been beautifully inspired with the cast contributing brilliant ideas to this vision. I am incredibly excited and I CAN'T WAIT to share this with you! <br/></p>
<h3>Where Your Money Will Go <br/>
</h3>
<div>
<i>Ode to the Elements Forever</i> is in need of $10,000 to realize the show's full potential. Funding will cover every part of production costs from theater rental, technical staff, videotaping, costuming (a LARGE part of the expenses due to the size of the cast), programs, advertising, and of course payment for the dancers. If you enjoy the performing arts, this is a great opportunity to support non-mainstream artists promoting the arts in their local community.

</div></div>","The Artist & The Production

I am a professional belly dance and fusion artist based in Austin, Texas with a dance career spanning more than 30 years and numerous productions. 
On October 24 & 25, 2014, I will be presenting an extraordinary dance production titled ""Ode to the Elements Forever"" at the Vortex Repertory Company Theatre in Austin. This production is a revival based on original music and dance from a previous production I did 25 years ago titled ""Ode to the Elements."" This rendition will have a company of 21 dancers and 5 musicians.  It will be a theatrical,  joyous, and deeply-moving performance experience for dance, art and music fans near and far. 
A dear friend once told me,""Helene, when you get a wild hair, you really get a wild hair and follow through!"" While in my dance studio in March of this year, I realized how much I wanted to bring this show back to the stage with the same concepts but presented in new ways. Art evolves and I want to reflect that evolution.  The response from performers who wanted to share in my vision was absolutely overwhelming! So onward I march and I would be honored and humbled to have your support in bringing this performing arts vision back to the stage. 

A Few Words From the Producer

The Elements of ""Elements""

The original production had a cast of dancers, but a large part of the show was my own solo performances. In this new incarnation, I turn my previous solos into large ensemble choreography pieces.  I will be personally presenting a vibrant, high energy solo in which I 
reprise movement from my 37 year career as a dancer and choreographer.

Vintage Music... 

Side A of our original music ""cassette"" (also called ""Ode to the Elements"") is used for a choreography suite that explores and honors the Five Elements of Earth, Air, Water, Fire and Spirit. 
Side B is another large ensemble choreography called ""Persephone's Ascent."" This piece reinterprets the ancient Greek myth of the goddess Persephone and her struggle with Demeter and Hades. 
The final section of the show will be live with dancers and musicians creatively coming together to express the Elements and the connection that we have with ourselves, each other, and our planet.  
Rehearsals so far have been beautifully inspired with the cast contributing brilliant ideas to this vision. I am incredibly excited and I CAN'T WAIT to share this with you! 
Where Your Money Will Go 


Ode to the Elements Forever is in need of $10,000 to realize the show's full potential. Funding will cover every part of production costs from theater rental, technical staff, videotaping, costuming (a LARGE part of the expenses due to the size of the cast), programs, advertising, and of course payment for the dancers. If you enjoy the performing arts, this is a great opportunity to support non-mainstream artists promoting the arts in their local community. Any contribution amount is deeply appreciated and will be put to work! We have many perks for you:  program mentions and dedications, tickets to the show, CDs, DVDs and more! 

I have a successful history of producing many large events that span several decades:  Blue Waves (1985) Ode to the Elements (1989) From East to West (1991) Rhythms from the Great Heart (1993)  Belly Dance Seasonal Shows (2001-2004) The Annual Middle Eastern Dance Choreography Competitions (2005-2011)Plus, numerous recitals and showcases as professor of dance at Austin Community College. Rest assured your contributions will be managed well and will be supporting the performing arts in meaningful ways!

<h3>MY STORY:</h3>
<p>Hey Fam,</p>
<p>My name is Dominique Morisseau and I am an emerging playwright living in New York City! This year has been amazing for me. I had the honor to develop my work with the Public's Emerging Writer's Group (<a href=""http://www.publictheater.org/content/view/154/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.publictheater.org/content/view/154/</a>) and the Lark Play Development Center's Playwrights' Workshop (<a href=""http://www.larktheatre.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.larktheatre.org/</a>),and I have grown so much as an artist, learned so much about myself, and cultivated my craft. I've walked away more confident in my artistry as a dramatist. I am so thankful for the opportunities I've had to continue to develop my work in these recent years, but now I'm ready to get out there!</p>
<p>My new play <strong>SUNSET BABY</strong>is being produced by the Gate Theatre in London, UK September 19 - October 20, 2012. SUNSET BABY is about a former black revolutionary Kenyatta Shakur and the relationship with his estranged daughter Nina. The play explores the gaps between generations, movements, and the effect that absent fathers have on their young daughters. That dynamic is so rarely examined on the stage: we usually talk about the effect it has on young black boys, but what about our girls?</p>
<p>When former Kenyatta reaches out to Nina shortly after her mother’s passing, he has high hopes of reuniting and burying the wounds of the past.  What he finds instead is a vengeful daughter who embodies everything contrary to the movement he fought in.  If Kenyatta truly wants to reconcile the past, he must first conquer his most challenging revolution of all--- fatherhood.</p>
<p><br/>I am over the moon that <strong>SUNSET BABY (<a href=""http://www.sunsetbaby.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sunsetbaby.com</a>) </strong>will be getting its world premiere in London, but I need your help in concquering a major obstacle. Unfortunately, due to recent cutbacks in the UK's government funding for the arts, the theatre will not be able to fund me so that I may participate in the full rehearsal process for my play (starting August 13th through opening, September 13th).</p>
<p>As a playwright working on a world premiere, it is integral that I am present. I want to be a dramturgical source for the actors in terms of the US history interwoven in the piece, the specific language of East New York and the general world of the play. I think it would benefit both the the actors and director, as we work together to  bring the work to life as authentically as possible.</p>
<p>I am in need of<strong> $5,500</strong> of funding for <strong>accommodations, transportation, and a food allowance.</strong> The impact that it would have on my life as an emerging playwright is inmeasurable. The rehearsal process of a new work is a fragile and exciting one and I want to be there for every second. I would learn how to be a ""working writer"" and not just an ""emerging writer.""</p>
<p>Most importantly, a bridge is being built across the ocean that unites the US and UK theatre worlds in an inextricable bond. This is not only for me, but a way to continue the dialogue that political theatres on both sides of the pond are having not only with each other, but with the world!</p>

The show already has the best talent from the Central Florida region (and beyond), and we’re thrilled to be bringing our production to the stage!</p>
<p>The highest-quality production depends on more than talent: the director, the set, the choreography and musicians, and, of course, the costumes.</p>
<p>We've got most of those things for <em>Dreamgirls</em>, but here's where you come in. The costumes for the Dreams must be absolutely show-stopping, and we need your help to raise $5,000 to <strong>Dress the Dreams</strong>!</p>
<p>While that might seem like a lot of money for clothes, shoes, and wigs, the Dreams’ costumes are really so much more than those things. <br/><br/>Not only will each Dream have several costume changes, but all of them are custom-designed and perfectly tailored to the individual performer. They need to be superb designs, be made of good fabrics and materials, and on top of that, they’ve got to stand up to the wear and tear of day-in, day-out movement on the stage.</p>
<p>Who wants to see Effie sing ""And I Am Telling You..."" in rags? Nobody.</p>
<p>Please help us make sure that the Dreams stand out in their costumes, making this production of <em>Dreamgirls </em>the best from top to bottom, head to toe!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/></strong></p>
<p>This $5,000 will completely costume the three Dreamgirls: Effie, Deena, and Lorrell. It will help cover the expenses of our costume designers, the fabrics/materials, and the labor and construction of the garments. If we don’t reach our entire goal, whatever we do earn will still go to outfitting the Dreams; if we go <em>above </em>our goal (yes!), it will go to help cover the costumes of the rest of the very large cast.</p>
<p>We want to reward your generosity, of course. Take a peek at our perks on the right side of the page! We have many levels of giving, and even the smallest amount will make a big difference to us. We won’t be able to do this without you!</p>
<p>If you’re not able to give, you’ll still be able to help – spread the word! Let your friends and family know about this campaign. We appreciate it!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Mad Cow Theatre is a nonprofit organization, and only a portion of our revenue comes from ticket sales. We depend on donors like you to help keep our productions going.</p>
<p>Mad Cow is in the middle of its 16<sup>th</sup> season, and we’ve been bringing the highest quality of performing arts to the region for all these years. We pride ourselves on being an important and beneficial part of the community. <em>Dreamgirls </em>is going to be an amazing event, and we want all of Central Florida to share in it!</p>

Catorce miembros del equipo (elenco, regidora, producción, utileria y vestuario, técnico de video mapping, entre otros) representaremos con nuestro trabajo al teatro puertorriqueño con este texto de Quiara Alegría Hudes, premio Pulitzer 2012.Debido a la importancia de este Festival Encuentro, todos los artistas viajarán a Los Ángeles entre el 20 de octubre y el 10 de noviembre para presentar la pieza en Los Ángeles Theatre Center (www.thelatc.org) de forma altruista. Como embajadores de Puerto Rico y del teatro latino nacional, no sólo presentaremos la pieza, sino que formaremos parte de este foro junto a doce de las más prestigiosas compañías de Estados Unidos para crear juntos y establecer lazos culturales con la comunidad artística latina.   Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes Aunque ya de por sí la invitación es un honor y no cobraremos por nuestro trabajo, para lograr esta misión necesitamos cubrir ciertos gastos.El Festival Encuentro provee transportación y hospedaje para los catorce miembros del equipo. Sin embargo, necesitamos sufragar la construcción de algunas piezas de escenografía, el alquiler de proyector de Video Mapping (recurso innovador que es elemento básico en nuestro montaje), gastos de dietas, entre otros.Aún no hemos logrado ayuda institucional, por lo que creemos que el crowdfunding y el auspicio privado es la mejor manera de poder realizar este trabajo y representar la cultura nacional con un nivel de excelencia.Con tu ayuda, vamos a lograr demostrar que la cultura puertorriqueña tiene un tiene su espacio en la esfera teatral mundial, como se reconoció a nivel internacional cuando Quiara Alegría Hudes (también nominada al Tony por el libreto del reconocido músical In The Heighs) obtuvo el prestigioso Pulitzer.Además, Tantai te obsequiará con varias recompensas por tu ayuda. ¡No te vas a arrepentir!  El impacto La trayectoria de trabajo de Tantai ha demostrado que se puede tener éxito con productos culturales de alta calidad que aporten al panorama artístico en Puerto Rico. Ahora es el momento de exportar esa representación y demostrar que nuestra Isla tiene un alto valor por la cultura. ¡Ayúdanos a demostrarlo!  Riesgos y desafíos En el camino a Los Ángeles, muchos gastos pueden surgir de improvisto. Tenemos que transportar utilería y vestuario, construir piezas de la escenografía, alquilar equipo... Necesitamos estar cubiertos económicamente ante los riesgos que nuestra producción pueda enfrentar para no desmerecer la calidad de nuestro trabajo. Estamos dispuestos a llevar nuestro arte de manera gratuita, pero... ¡te necesitamos para que sea viable!  Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar  Cualquier aportación es valida, por pequeña que sea. Cada granito cuenta y te lo agradeceremos desde lo más profundo de nuestro corazón. Aún así, si no puedes ayudarnos económicamente, también puedes:

</h3><p><span><b>Calling All Art
Lovers:</b> Lux Boreal Dance Company seeks your help in funding an incredibly
important event that supports emerging choreographers. This is the fifth
conference Lux has produced since 2009 and we are happy to report the
conference’s expansion in interest and attendance from young artists spanning
North and Central America. </span></p>
<p><span>Lux Boreal is
delighted to witness the continued growth of the conference of emerging
choreographers and provide the newest generation of dance artists the
opportunity to network and share their creations with the public of Tijuana,
Mexico. In addition to such success, we are also challenged with the raising
costs necessary to produce such a beneficial and educational event. Lux’s
conferences promote not only the Northwest dance scene of Mexico, but also the display
of unique point of views in contemporary dance from different parts of the
world.</span><b><span></span></b></p><p><b><span><br/></span></b>

<p><span>Lux Boreal
Dance Company in conjunction with the Municipal Institute Of Art and Culture
(IMAC) of Tijuana presents the 5th Conference of Emerging Choreographers, <i>Tijuana in Movement 2014</i> as an effort to
encourage the enhancement and development of new generations of choreographers
and art</span><span>ists seeking to join the professional dance scene.<span>   </span></span><br/><br/><span>The conference's main objective is to serve as a
platform for the display of fresh dance proposals. Operating as such a unique
event, young choreographers and artists alike, from various regions of Mexico,
the United States, and South America will have the opportunity to connect with
other members of the professional dance scene. These connections and networks
will thereby help generate and foster a genuinely diverse and international
cultural conversation.<span>  </span><br/><br/>
The 5th Conference of Emerging Choreographers, <i>Tijuana in Movement 2014</i> runs from July
30th to August 2nd, 2014 in the city of Tijuana, Baja California at the
rehearsal space and traditional theater of Tijuana's House of Culture, as well
as specific urban sites within the city to provide an alternative performance
space to spur insight.</span></p><h3>

</p><p>La Compañía de Danza Lux Boreal solicita su apoyo
para financiar un encuentro jóvenes artistas y bailarines que se realiza en la
ciudad de Tijuana. Este es la quinta edición de este evento que Lux Boreal
produce desde el 2009 y nos sentimos
orgullosos de comunicar que cada año ha continuado expandiéndose, atrayendo a jóvenes
artistas desde América del Norte hasta Sudamérica.<span>  </span></p>
<span></span>
<p>
</p><p>Para la compañía de danza Lux Boreal ha sido un
logro importante el crecimiento del Encuentro de Jóvenes Creadores, el cual
representa una plataforma para las nuevas generaciones de artistas, donde se brinda la exposición, la visibilidad,
la crítica y la retroalimentación, así como compartir sus creaciones con el
público del área Tijuana, México. </p>
<p>Sin embargo, en este 2014, la organización del
Encuentro enfrenta un déficit presupuestal con el aumento los costos para
producirlo. Este año, la programación busca proyectar no solo la escena de la
danza del noroeste de México, sino también la exhibición de interesantes puntos
de vista de danza contemporánea de diferentes partes del mundo.</p>
<p><b>V Encuentro de Jóvenes Creadores Tijuana en
Movimiento 2014:</b></p>
<p>Con
el objetivo de motivar el desarrollo de las nuevas generaciones de creadores y
artistas en formación que busquen incorporarse a la escena de la danza
profesional, Lux Boreal en conjunto con el Instituto de Cultura de Baja
California, convocan al V Encuentro de Jóvenes Creadores, Tijuana en Movimiento
2014.</p>
<p>Este
encuentro tiene como principal objetivo, instalarse como un sólido foro para la
exhibición de propuestas dancísticas frescas, donde jóvenes de México, Estados
Unidos y Sudamérica los lleve a coincidir en la escena dancística, propiciando
así una genuina diversidad del diálogo escénico.</p>
<p>El
V Encuentro de Jóvenes Creadores, Tijuana Danza 2014, se realizará los días 30,
31 de julio, 1 y 2 de agosto del 2014 en la ciudad de Tijuana, Baja California
y tendrá como espacio escénico el Teatro de la <b>Casa de la Cultura de Tijuana
</b>así como sedes de intervención en <b>Casa de Cultura de Playas.</b></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Lo Que Necesitamos/ Lo Que Recibes</b>

Lovers: Lux Boreal Dance Company seeks your help in funding an incredibly
important event that supports emerging choreographers. This is the fifth
conference Lux has produced since 2009 and we are happy to report the
conference’s expansion in interest and attendance from young artists spanning
North and Central America. 
Lux Boreal is
delighted to witness the continued growth of the conference of emerging
choreographers and provide the newest generation of dance artists the
opportunity to network and share their creations with the public of Tijuana,
Mexico. In addition to such success, we are also challenged with the raising
costs necessary to produce such a beneficial and educational event. Lux’s
conferences promote not only the Northwest dance scene of Mexico, but also the display
of unique point of views in contemporary dance from different parts of the
world.

5th Conference of Emerging Choreographers, Tijuana in
Movement 2014:
Lux Boreal
Dance Company in conjunction with the Municipal Institute Of Art and Culture
(IMAC) of Tijuana presents the 5th Conference of Emerging Choreographers, Tijuana in Movement 2014 as an effort to
encourage the enhancement and development of new generations of choreographers
and artists seeking to join the professional dance scene.   The conference's main objective is to serve as a
platform for the display of fresh dance proposals. Operating as such a unique
event, young choreographers and artists alike, from various regions of Mexico,
the United States, and South America will have the opportunity to connect with
other members of the professional dance scene. These connections and networks
will thereby help generate and foster a genuinely diverse and international
cultural conversation.  
The 5th Conference of Emerging Choreographers, Tijuana in Movement 2014 runs from July
30th to August 2nd, 2014 in the city of Tijuana, Baja California at the
rehearsal space and traditional theater of Tijuana's House of Culture, as well
as specific urban sites within the city to provide an alternative performance
space to spur insight.

Thanks to IMAC, Mexico en Escena, Conaculta, Fonca, and the House of Culture
of Tijuana Lux has already covered the costs of renting the theater and its
technicians, payment to the staff during the conference, renting of the dance
space for the workshops, and site-specific performances. 
We are asking
for your help to cover the following costs: 


3-day/3-night
hotel and food accommodations for the 16 accepted artists.

Payments to the
invited teachers of our four separate dance workshops.

All choreographers and dancers
attending from outside of Tijuana (Oaxaca [Mexico], San Luis Potosí, Mazatlan,
Mexico City, New York City [USA], and Bogotá [Columbia]) are responsible for
their own transportation to and from the convention. We do not believe it is
fair to ask the participants to add the extra cost of food and lodging while
they are in attendance. Hence, we are inquiring about your ability to help us
relieve this cost.
What we offer in return:

Recognition
within the social network and our Newsletter.

Recognition
within the program of the conference.

Recognition
within our website at www.luxboreal.org


Complimentary
entry into the performances of the conference.

Complimentary
entry into another Lux Boreal performance.

A free T-shirt
from the even which we give to all of the participants.

And of course
our sincerest most heart felt gratitude!

The Conference will occur from July 30th until August 2nd, 2014

La Compañía de Danza Lux Boreal solicita su apoyo
para financiar un encuentro jóvenes artistas y bailarines que se realiza en la
ciudad de Tijuana. Este es la quinta edición de este evento que Lux Boreal
produce desde el 2009 y nos sentimos
orgullosos de comunicar que cada año ha continuado expandiéndose, atrayendo a jóvenes
artistas desde América del Norte hasta Sudamérica.  


Para la compañía de danza Lux Boreal ha sido un
logro importante el crecimiento del Encuentro de Jóvenes Creadores, el cual
representa una plataforma para las nuevas generaciones de artistas, donde se brinda la exposición, la visibilidad,
la crítica y la retroalimentación, así como compartir sus creaciones con el
público del área Tijuana, México. 
Sin embargo, en este 2014, la organización del
Encuentro enfrenta un déficit presupuestal con el aumento los costos para
producirlo. Este año, la programación busca proyectar no solo la escena de la
danza del noroeste de México, sino también la exhibición de interesantes puntos
de vista de danza contemporánea de diferentes partes del mundo.
V Encuentro de Jóvenes Creadores Tijuana en
Movimiento 2014:
Con
el objetivo de motivar el desarrollo de las nuevas generaciones de creadores y
artistas en formación que busquen incorporarse a la escena de la danza
profesional, Lux Boreal en conjunto con el Instituto de Cultura de Baja
California, convocan al V Encuentro de Jóvenes Creadores, Tijuana en Movimiento
2014.
Este
encuentro tiene como principal objetivo, instalarse como un sólido foro para la
exhibición de propuestas dancísticas frescas, donde jóvenes de México, Estados
Unidos y Sudamérica los lleve a coincidir en la escena dancística, propiciando
así una genuina diversidad del diálogo escénico.
El
V Encuentro de Jóvenes Creadores, Tijuana Danza 2014, se realizará los días 30,
31 de julio, 1 y 2 de agosto del 2014 en la ciudad de Tijuana, Baja California
y tendrá como espacio escénico el Teatro de la Casa de la Cultura de Tijuana
así como sedes de intervención en Casa de Cultura de Playas.Lo Que Necesitamos/ Lo Que Recibes

The exceedingly short opera is the centerpiece of an immersive installation offering audiences a window into the decadence and absurdity of Trump’s world against the backdrop of a 7,000 sq.ft. condemned space in a Manhattan tower. Told entirely from the perspectives of Ivana, Marla and Melania, the story doesn’t allow Drumf a word in edgewise. Honestly, he doesn’t deserve one.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Middle Ground Theatre is a collective based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We are comprised of current and former students from the University of New Mexico.</p>
<p>This campaign is to help us put up our second production, Stop Kiss by Diana Son. This show is important to us because we want to start conversations in the Albuquerque community about topics such as interracial relationships, bisexuality, and misogyny.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will help us put up a show that is about more than entertainment. It's about relationships and identity. With Stop Kiss, we hope to open a dialogue spanning across generational lines, something that we can talk about no matter our class or race.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In total, we need $900. All funding will go towards getting this show up and running in January 2018. This includes costumes, makeup, performance space, marketing, furniture, set pieces, and props. Additionally, if we reach our goal, we'll donate $100 to the Hispanic Federation for disaster relief in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Perks include signed goods, social media shout-outs, and reserved seats!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we'll use whatever we have to fund Stop Kiss as best we can. The show must go on!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is valuable because representation matters. Stop Kiss features a diverse cast with two strong woman leads.</p>
<p>Middle Ground Theatre's previous campaign raised $1,000 for our very first show, Gruesome Playground Injuries by Rajiv Joseph. We reached our entire goal and put on 7 performances from August 25 through September 3, 2017</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>As a brand new theatre company, we face the challenge of visibility. As we build up our company, we need to get the word out about raising funds for our shows. Since we're all college students, we don't inherently have the money to fully fund ourselves, which is where you come in! Every dollar helps us build awareness in Albuquerque, which will allow us to put on shows in the future</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Tight on money? No problem! You can help us out by spreading the word about Middle Ground Theatre and this campaign. You can follow us on Facebook and Instagram to like, comment, and share our posts. Thanks!</p>

<h3>Hi!</h3>
<p>Thank you for clicking through to us, and for reading! We are an emerging theatre company in Manchester. And we need your help!</p>
<p>YESYESNONO is one of the most exciting young companies in the UK right now. Our debut show, 'Five Encounters on a Site Called Craigslist' won the Total Theatre Award for Best Emerging Company 2017, and following our second show, '[insert slogan here]' the Guardian included us in their list of the Top Five Best Young Companies of 2018. </p>
<p>We're making a new show. It's called  'the accident did not take place' and it's about mass media and social media and the effect they have on information and truth. This is a big step up in scale for us, as we introduce multiple performers, new technical equipment, and a series of new engagement and outreach schemes alongside the process. We're making the show with the dedicated support of ARC Centre in Stockton, HOME in Manchester and Camden People's Theatre in London and are touring it through Autumn 2019 and beyond. If we are to achieve this great step up in scale and ambition, we need to raise funds through channels like crowdfunding alongside our Arts Council Grant application.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The engagement work for our new show is split into three strands. We're hoping that if these strands are successful for this project, they will become a regular and crucial feature of our work in the future. We need support from our backers to pay for food for our participants, travel for our participants, and fees for the workshop facilitators. Here's what we've got in store:</p>
<p>Firstly, we'll be hosting <strong>Focus Groups</strong> and <strong>Practical Workshops</strong> with young people from colleges local to each of our partner venues. These groups will be focussed on the themes of the show: mass and social media. We want to talk to the people who have grown up with these media as a regular part of their life from early age, and hear what they have to say about those themes. The groups are an opportunity for our show to develop according to the viewpoints of young people with a unique perspective on these media, and for us to avoid patronising tones in our treatment of the material. They are also a chance for young people to discuss and explore these issues in a safe space with their peers, whilst investigating how they work in a fun and practical way. As a company, we will provide food and travel for all participants. </p>
<p>Secondly, we'll be launching our <strong>Open Rehearsal Scheme </strong>at each of our partner venues. On certain days within our time at each venue, we will open our rehearsal room to a group of select emerging artists, to come and observe our process. We want this scheme to be a means with which emerging artists can gain new skills, ask any questions they might have, and garner an understanding of the broader process of making a show. As such, we will put aside dedicated time at the end of the rehearsal, so as to allow the participants to offer their thoughts and ask any questions. In this way the scheme offers us avenues with which we can develop our own practise, as well as that of artists around us. As a company, we will provide all travel costs for the participants to these schemes.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we'll be opening our weekly <strong>Sharings </strong>to all participants from the Focus Groups and Open Rehearsal Scheme, as well as other young artists we think would enjoy the opportunity to see work in development. Not only does this provide us with a broad range of critical angles with which to develop our process and our work, but it also offers young artists and college students to see work in development, and to see how a process manifests at various stages in the journey of a show. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>All of these schemes are part of our broader desire to open our work up to audiences and to artists. We want to bring the viewpoints, opinions and ideas of the people who we make work about, whilst offering up our process and our ideas to them at every stage of a show's journey. </p>
<p>As individual artists, Sam and Rhian have organised, facilitated and managed engagement schemes for a long time, and across multiple demographics. This represents an opportunity to fold that experience into the process and philosophy of YESYESNONO and our work.</p>
<p>To make these schemes successful, and to bring in the people we want to bring in, we need to be able to provide travel and food. This is a crucial part of the budget that we are asking for support with. We also need to provide facilitator fees for the <strong>Focus Groups </strong>and <strong>Practical Workshops</strong>, to ensure that we are maximising what we get and what we offer from that time. This is a crucial part of the budget for which we are asking for your support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Perks and Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Take a look at the bar at the side for the great rewards on offer for our backers. If you have any questions about any of them, don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
<p>If you can't donate then that's absolutely fine. But if you want to support YESYESNONO and think that we're doing sounds exciting, then you can help us out by sharing this link to other people. Getting the word out is just as good!</p>
</div><p>Thank you all, and we'll see you all soon!</p><p>Sam and Rhian</p></div>","Hi!

<h3>What Is Zombie Asian Moms?</h3>
<p>This campaign is for Zombie Asian Moms: the newest project by <i>Slanty Eyed Mama</i> aka. Asian American artists Kate Siahaan-Rigg and Lyris Hung. We are conducting oral history interviews with real Asian moms to expand the discussion on how cultural ideas and identities can get passed down through generations and live forever, sometimes consuming your brain- like zombies. </p>
<p>First, we will premiere the show live from Nov. 29-Dec 9, 2018  in New York at the Tony Award Winning Theater La MaMa ETC.  (where we premiered <i>Happy Lucky Golden Tofu Panda Dragon Good Time Fun Fun Show</i> two years ago to great acclaim.) Then, it will be documented and expanded to become a documentary/concert film for festivals, online release and as a teaching tool.</p>
<p>We started <i>Slanty Eyed Mama</i> while studying at the Juilliard School in New York City to create works that speak to a new generAsian of North Americans by using the language of pop culture: comedy, rap, rock, spoken-word poetry. We have played the Smithsonian Institute (with <i>Birth of a nASIAN </i>and <i>Americasiana</i>), The Comedy Central Theater, LOGO television, PBS, many Asian Heritage Celebrations, Comedy festivals, Music festivals, Contemporary Art Museums and Universities. Our work combines cultural identity politics and a discussion of racial politics with a mashup of music, comedy and improvisation. </p>
<p>If we reach our goal of 10K, it will fund the bulk of  the live shows at La MaMa and the audio visual recording of those shows. But the budget for the whole project is around 45K (see breakdown below.) We are undertaking this more ambitious project because our shows are often used as teaching tools for younger people, and we want to have a shareable, easily accessible document of the work that can be used to fight racism, promote understanding, empathy and compassion while providing Asian Americans a voice in the conversation about what makes an ""American"" family.</p>
<p>We have always self-funded, self-propelled, paid from touring, paid from our other gigs and side hustle. We play in big venues for thousands of people as well as in small college dorm rooms. The message is the media and we are devoted to giving voice to those American Asians who don't have a prominent place in popular media. But normally, our reach is limited to our touring time. We are seeking funding to help us to continue to record our work and be able to send it out to colleges and communities who are seeking to expand their discourse on diversity and inclusion, two critical initiatives that these times demand. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need help this time to make our work happen. Self-funded tours cleaned us out a little this year, and our grant money fell through. We are tapping savings, but let's face it we are artists-- it isn't enough.  We need funds mostly to pay the artists and technicians we need to bring their expertise to the project. We don't pay ourselves out of this campaign, Lyris and Kate both put in their own savings to allot time, costumes, rehearsal and equipment to create the work. But we need people to help us put up the live show in New York: lighting, design, sound, projections.  For the film version, we need help for photogtaphy, edit, sound mix and design and animation.  We are keeping this indie, nimble and bare bones, but an infusion of funds will help us launch the live show and start filming while we go out and earn more money by hustling and touring to finish the project.  Our total preliminary budget looks like this:</p>
<p>Barebones Breakdown:</p>
<p>-Live show production costs  include space rental, hiring a designer and lighting designer, costumes, props, some video editing, equipment, front of house costs, printing: 8K</p>
<p>-Recording and sound mixing the live shows: 5K</p>
<p>-Additional filming with Asian moms and location shoots: 7K</p>
<p>-Post production costs including sound mix, edit: 10K</p>
<p>-Fees for director, publicist,  art design, after effects: 10K</p>
<p>-Insurance, Tax, Admin, Fire proofing, Festival applications: 5K</p>
<p>= 45K </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When people are exposed to stories about diverse communities, it breeds empathy, understanding and compassion. And when a minority group sees itself reflected in a popular form of media like comedy or contemporary art, it builds bridges and strengthens community. Through our work,  Asians who are still treated like ""foreigners"" in their own country get to see reflections of other Amerasians who share their experience as daughters and grand daughters of immigrants. And particularly for young people:  when you don't see images of yourself out there in the world, there is no success paradigm, there is nothing to shoot for and you are caught between the impossible demands of your Asian Ancestors and the racially biased America that sees you as ""not really american"". We are all in this together.  A show about crazy, beautiful, intense, cute, sassy, lenient, strict moms who happen to be Asian can deepen our connections to each other and combat racism, depression, social dysfunction and other ills that come from seeing minority groups as ""other"".</p>
<p>We are making a movie of the live shows so we can reach audiences all over North America who can't make it to see us in person.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>An easy way to help is to follow us on Instagram Twitter and Facebook <strong>@slantyeyedmama</strong>.  It's free, we are not spammers and it will automatically help us by showing the world that voices from diverse artists are valuable. So if nothing else, please add us on social. </p>
<p>You can also: come to see our show, spread this campaign around social media,  invite us to play a concert at your school or venue, and check out our website.</p>

And when a minority group sees itself reflected in a popular form of media like comedy or contemporary art, it builds bridges and strengthens community. Through our work,  Asians who are still treated like ""foreigners"" in their own country get to see reflections of other Amerasians who share their experience as daughters and grand daughters of immigrants. And particularly for young people:  when you don't see images of yourself out there in the world, there is no success paradigm, there is nothing to shoot for and you are caught between the impossible demands of your Asian Ancestors and the racially biased America that sees you as ""not really american"". We are all in this together.  A show about crazy, beautiful, intense, cute, sassy, lenient, strict moms who happen to be Asian can deepen our connections to each other and combat racism, depression, social dysfunction and other ills that come from seeing minority groups as ""other"".
We are making a movie of the live shows so we can reach audiences all over North America who can't make it to see us in person.

Other Ways You Can Help
An easy way to help is to follow us on Instagram Twitter and Facebook @slantyeyedmama.  It's free, we are not spammers and it will automatically help us by showing the world that voices from diverse artists are valuable. So if nothing else, please add us on social. 
You can also: come to see our show, spread this campaign around social media,  invite us to play a concert at your school or venue, and check out our website.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

After multiple attempts on my own life, learning the shocking truth of my origins, and a show-down with an NYPD armada as I attempt to reconnect with my father, I ultimately leave the West to begin a rebirth in Japan.

the direction of Tammy Kanode, my ballet instructor in Lynchburg, my solo
entitled “Sail” received first place at Dance Machine’s regional competition in
March, and in April I was awarded a partial scholarship from Celebration
Talent’s regional competition to attend master classes in Los Angeles,
California. It is the best opportunity to take master classes, meet with
choreographers who are in the industry, and attend a taping of “So You Think
You Can Dance” among other scheduled events. Celebration Talent awards only two
scholarships at each of their 28 regional competitions, usually resulting in
20–30 dancers from their venue attending program in the summer. </span></p><p></p><p></p>

dad works two jobs and my mom home schools me and my younger sister.  We
live an hour from my dance studio so a lot of time is taken up traveling.
 My mother helps sew some of the costumes to pay for dance classes so
there are not many funds left over to fuel a dream.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

is where your contribution will make a difference. California is a long way
from Virginia. Classes are very expensive. The full week of master classes and
hotel for a chaperone and I costs $4,700. Airfare, food, shuttle services, and
other traveling expenses are also needed. That is why I could really use your
help and support. I will take my solo to Shenandoah University in the coming
year as my audition piece to their BFA program in dance. If accepted, I plan to
major in dance and also pursue their Masters in Arts Management degree. The
classes in California will help me to hone my technique and broaden who I am
creatively. I know it will increase my chances for a future, a successful
future in dance!</span></p><p></p><p></p>

<p></p></div>","Hi!
My name is Nikolaos Hartnett, and I love to dance! View the video by clicking
'Gallery' and the video will be right there!
Under
the direction of Tammy Kanode, my ballet instructor in Lynchburg, my solo
entitled “Sail” received first place at Dance Machine’s regional competition in
March, and in April I was awarded a partial scholarship from Celebration
Talent’s regional competition to attend master classes in Los Angeles,
California. It is the best opportunity to take master classes, meet with
choreographers who are in the industry, and attend a taping of “So You Think
You Can Dance” among other scheduled events. Celebration Talent awards only two
scholarships at each of their 28 regional competitions, usually resulting in
20–30 dancers from their venue attending program in the summer. 
My
dad works two jobs and my mom home schools me and my younger sister.  We
live an hour from my dance studio so a lot of time is taken up traveling.
 My mother helps sew some of the costumes to pay for dance classes so
there are not many funds left over to fuel a dream.
This
is where your contribution will make a difference. California is a long way
from Virginia. Classes are very expensive. The full week of master classes and
hotel for a chaperone and I costs $4,700. Airfare, food, shuttle services, and
other traveling expenses are also needed. That is why I could really use your
help and support. I will take my solo to Shenandoah University in the coming
year as my audition piece to their BFA program in dance. If accepted, I plan to
major in dance and also pursue their Masters in Arts Management degree. The
classes in California will help me to hone my technique and broaden who I am
creatively. I know it will increase my chances for a future, a successful
future in dance!
I can assure you that by contributing
to this fund you are investing in hard work, resolve in adversity, but most
importantly in the art of dance that translates personal experience into a form
to speak to others that transforms the spirit, encourages and excites that part
in all of us that dares us to live fully, to dream, to persevere.
I am thankful to my Creator who graced me with a
desire to dance. I am grateful to my family, the families of my studios who
have encouraged me with their kindness and support. I am thankful for the

Kanode, my ballet teacher and Marquis Mapp, my hip-hop, jazz and modern
teacher. They have been with me on this journey of growth and without them I would
have not realized the dancer within. 
I encourage you all to dream, to take a risk - for we only
fail when we fail to try.
Should
I not reach my goal, I will use the funds to further my dance education with
Master classes that are not in California. Although, California would be an
incredible experience, it is a joy to dance and I will pursue excellence in any
form it is presented to me!

<h3>Who am I and Why am I Doing This Project: </h3>
<p>My name is Casey Marie, and I am an emerging theatre artist based out of the Twin Cities. Although I am early in my career, I am driven and self-motivated. I have always believed that theatre can be used in more ways then just to entertain an audience.  Which brings me to:</p>
<p>February 14th, 2018; a day that was suppose to be filled with love was instead filled will tears and dismay. I remember refreshing my web page, as more and more information about the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School came in. By the end of the day, 17 students and teachers had died; by the end of the week, a movement was started. </p>
<p>I supported the movement, joined in the marches, called my representatives, and yes, posted crazily on Facebook. I thought there had to be more I could do, but, with my limited skill set and resources, what? That's when this project started. </p>
<p>I found a number of short scenes and monologues through <a href=""http://www.protestplays.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Protest Plays Project</a> that I hope will give an audience a perspective on mass shootings that they haven't thought about before. After each performance we will have talkback discussions with our audience, our artists, and members of non profit organizations who are already fighting for gun control.  Through these discussions, we hope to not only have impactful conversations, but we also to connect passionate audience members with groups in their neighborhoods to help the cause.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Does the Money Go:</h3>
<p>Even though this project is being independently produced I still fully believe in paying artists for their work and contribution to the project. That is why</p>
<p>$1,300 is for artists stipends. Many passionate artists will be working on this project, including eight actors, a full production team, as well as others such as graphic designers and photographers.</p>
<p>$500 is for production needs such as costumes, set pieces, and props. Although we plan on being as minimalist as possible, we know there will be somethings we need to rent, such as a police uniform and prop guns, that will cost us some money. </p>
<p>The last $200 is for advertising. We have someone working hard on marketing and our goal is to get the news about this production out to as many people as we can. The more people that we can get into the theatre the bigger the impact we can have on our community. </p>
<p>This brings our goal to $2,000.</p>
<p><strong>So what happens if the production comes in under budget or we raise more than our goal!?</strong></p>
<p>If we have amazing backers like you, we will donate any remaining funds to <a href=""https://everytown.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Everytown for Gun Safety</a>, an American nonprofit organization which advocates for gun control and against gun violence. </p>

<h3>How Am I Making this Happen?</h3>
<p>Although I am an individual producer, I have an amazing team who all have professional experience in their fields. </p>
<p>This project is also backed by Arts Nest's Fledgling Program through a grant from the Minnesota Regional Arts Council. Arts Nest's mission is to nurture and support emerging artists and arts professionals – through creating access and opportunities for learning, connections, and visibility.

The Show
It’s a real privilege to have been awarded the first commission from The Rural Touring Dance Initiative (RTDI) which is going to assist bgroup create and tour this brand new piece of dance-theatre to rural settings around the UK. We are conceiving and designing the work for a range of spaces with minimal resources but in true bgroup style we are promising to turn up with some pretty high production values. 
Point of Echoes is a tale of love, death and mystical creatures based entirely on a newly written play, told through dance and original music. I have found myself referring to it as akin to a ghost tale around a campfire or an uncanny tale at bedtime. It’s going to be creepy and up close.
I'm thrilled to be bringing together an excellent Creative Team for the project; Writer and Composer Stuart Warwick, Stage & Costume Designer Will Holt, Lighting Designer Lucy Hansom and performers Dom Czapski, Carl Harrison and Marta Masiero. 
The Impact
Our aim is to tour Point of Echoes far and wide, offering many communities the opportunity to experience something rather different, cozy and compelling.  
The show is designed to be flexible enough to work in both theatre spaces and village halls, which is a really exciting prospect. We will be transforming each performance space into an intimate setting, with audience located on four sides, surrounded by an immersive seascape around the edge of the space.

<div><span><strong>The director: </strong></span></div>
<div>I am Moema Umann, a Brooklyn-based director. I started my career in Brazil and since 2006 I have been working in theater and movies produced in United States also. I hold a Bachelor degree from the University of Brasilia in performing arts and a Masters Degree in directing from the Actors Studio Drama School. In the summer of 2010 I was selected to be part of the Directors Lab at the Lincoln Center and to be part of the Actors Studio Playwrights and Directors Workshop. I received an award as Best Female Director at the 2010 American International Film Festival for the movie <em>Before Breakfast, </em>which was also accepted at the 2011 Short Film Corner in Cannes, the Big Apple Film Festival, New Filmmakers 2012, among others. Recently the film Noemia got an award at Hollyshorts Festival in Los Angeles. My last film productions <em>Moth </em>and<em> Strawberry </em>are currently in postproduction. I am delighted and very grateful to be now directing <em>White Noise</em> by Tom Block at The Theater For The New City. </div>

<div><span><strong>Description of the campaign:</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong> </strong></span></div>
<div>
<p>White Noise follows an African-American painter whose work is based on spiritual themes, as he travels to Detroit for an art exhibit of his work. At first calm, mature and erudite, Tim meets a seemingly normal cast of characters, who are volunteers with the church arts committee where Tim is to exhibit his paintings.  However, all of them from the hidden poet Lilac, cultural ambassador and psychically injured Sally and ex-Northrup Grumman Vice President Dick to the oversexed marriage therapist Joan, tweak at his interior demons. Tim struggles with and then succumbs to his own fixations, as an increasingly bizarre exterior reality and a scantily-clad Simone Weil, a historical figure that metastasizes as a figment of his own imagination, close in on him.</p>
<p>Having abandoned true faith, Tim grasps for ""faith in faith,"" and in the end finds dubious understanding, alone in a bathroom.  The review of the Washington DC production IN DC THEATER SCENE (JUNE 9, 2012) stated that it was “a fascinating and rewarding look at the multiple dimensions of faith, theory, and inspiration.” Also:</p>
<p>Tim arrives in the midst of a heated squabble. Little is said about his art, but what follows is an extended discussion of his struggle, his own chosen Muse, Simon Weil, and spiritual self-realization. If that sounds dry, it’s not: as the play progresses, it disintegrates into a mélange of Jungian motifs, sexual hang-ups, racial prejudices and other demons of the modern age . . . it’s a crazy mélange of process and imagination. . . a fascinating peek at the side most artists don’t want us to see: the creation (and deconstruction) of the persona. Tim arrives as a selfmade guru of eastern wisdom; by the end of the play, he’s a hypocritical addict of Internet Porn.</p>
</div>
<div><span>Producing a New York theater piece is a massive undertaking, especially as I live in Washington D.C.  Director, Assistant Director, Stage Manager, Set Designer, Costume Designer, Media Specialist, Musician and Choreographer, as well as the actors, must all be paid!  These dedicated professionals work their magic for far less than they deserve, yet must still be remunerated.  With a tough play of this sort, which picks at the scab of the human experience, the monetary payback is not secured, while the emotional and spiritual reward is high.  Is this not the realm of true art?  Therefore, we would love your help in paying this incredible cast and crew that Moema Umann (herself an award winning Director) has pulled together for the production.</span></div>

The Playwright: 


I am Tom Block, a playwright, author and painter whose work concerns issues of contemporary prophecy, activism, hope, nihilism, mysticism and insanity.  And how they can all exist within the same person or event.  I had my first two plays produced (in Washington D.C.) this past year, about which reviewers said that I offered a ""a fascinating and rewarding look at the multiple dimensions of faith, theory, and inspiration"" and ""If you’d like to explore where theater will be ten years from now it is probably worth a look.""  White Noise is my first full-length New York production..  


I have also had two books published (""Shalom/Salaam: A Story of a Mystical Fraternity"" in both the United States and Turkey in 2010 and ""A Fatal Addiction: War in the Name of God"" by Algora Publishers, NY, in 2012) and I have two more moving toward publication in the next year or so. 


I have exhibited my artwork around the United States and Europe. And I have spoken about my ideas at universities and conferences in Egypt, Turkey, Spain, Ireland, Canada and throughout the United States.  I was a Research Fellow at DePaul University's International Human Rights Law Institute (as an artist in residence) in 2010, as well as the founding producer of the Amnesty International Human Rights Art Festival, 2010 (MD). Most recently, I was awarded a Maryland State Arts Council Individual Artist Award (2013) for my painting Jiwar, which is part of theWhite Noise set.  www.tomblock.com

Your Contribution:
 
You will be helping to bring to life a unique piece of theater, my first play, which, as the review of the Washington D.C. premier (June 2012), noted: ""explores the artist's thought process, as he works in the lonely world between spiritual, theoretical, and artistic.   As the play progresses, it disintegrates into a mélange of Jungian motifs, sexual hang-ups, racial prejudices and other demons of the modern age.

<p>My plan is to present this concert reading pay-what-you-can. Certainly, that is the spirit of the Occupy Movement but also, I’ve watched so many wonderful productions in NYC close because their audience couldn’t afford to see them. Hopefully, I can reach a larger audience pay-what-you-can, perhaps people who wouldn’t normally budget the time or resources to see live theatre.</p>
<p>I’ve been a member the BMI advanced musical theatre writers workshop since 2006. I received their award for artistic accomplishments in my first year. My full bio and resume and credits are on my website (carldanielsen.com) - I’ve worked extensively as an actor in NYC and across the country doing everything from Greek Tragedy to musicals to Law and Order. My writing and compositions have been presented in various theatrical venues across the country. Bringing Fire (Prometheus of Wall Street) was first presented as a part of the Golden Fleece New Works series in 2011 and received a Tyrone Guthrie award from the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Canada which I used to record the score.</p>
<p>The White Box theatre at 440 Broadway is $50 an hour, so the total for 4 hours on 2 days is $400. I’d also love to guarantee the 7 actors and djembe player $100 each for their long rehearsal hours to present this piece. Grand total: $1200</p>
<p>Paul Pontrelli, Prometheus; Shauna Goodgold Io/Hermes/Bia; Steven Hajar, Hephaestus; Kelly Morris, Ebonee Noel, Rebecca Odorisio, Oceanids; Arthur Rowan, Kratos/Oceanus. Steele Kratt (djembe)</p>
<p>Can you help me spread the word about this event? It will be May 30 and June 6 at 7. Rowan and the Rose will begin the program with 3 songs of social unrest and someone from the Occupy Movement will lead a discussion afterwards. My long term goal is to present this concert on a regular basis, moving towards a full production meanwhile inspiring discussion and actual change. All in the pay-what-you-can format...</p>
<p> Addendum (4/30/2013) If you notice, we've reached our goal. If you still want to give, go right ahead. Whatever we get over the $1200 will go straight to the amazing actors and musicians. Your name will go in the program, or whatever the perk is. Go right on giving.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Book of Dreams is a new production company in Portland, OR, started in 2011. Costa Rehab is our second show, performed in a small, intimate setting in Southeast Portland. It is written by local playwright Rich Rubin. In fitting with our vision for our company, it is timely and thought-provoking, while at the same time infused with much humor. </p>
<p>We will run from May 24 through June 23, Thursdays through Sundays at 8 PM at the Backdoor Theater, 4319 SE Hawthorne Blvd. Portland OR. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $4000 that we are asking for pays for the 5-week rental of the theater space where we will perform. It also pays for original music, photography, publicity, costumes, props, and a stipend for the actors and technicians. What we offer mainly has to do with chances to interact with us, and learn more about the project and our company first hand. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are donating 5% of the total proceeds during the run and 100% of a single performance to the Wounded Warrior Project, which benefits returning soldiers in various different ways. However, our main goal in this project is to draw attention to a subject that is all but forgotten by many. Those who serve our country need to be recognized and honored, and we will attempt to do just that. </p>

<h3>BORDERLINE REMIX: A Hip HOpera for Border-jumpers and Stowaways</h3>
<p><span class=""il"">The 2012 Borderline Remix</span> unites Israeli, Palestinian, German, and African youth musicians, filmmakers and dancers (ages 16-21) to explore and voice experiences of migration and the quest for home.</p>
<p>Working together over the course of six months from their home countries (meeting in Jericho, Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Manheim) participants are exploring their diverse personal and communal narratives of forced migration, learning about the human right of asylum, and feeding their understanding, struggles, and hopes into their original music, film, and dance creations.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt=""desert workshop"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.heartbeat.fm/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/208450_10150219144058714_365054763713_8579987_6084581_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In August 2012, the full group will unite for the first time in Jerusalem, to weave their works together into the first ever Hip HOpera of its kind.  After one week of rehearsals and debut performances in Jerusalem and Jaffa/Tel Aviv, the group flies to Manheim, Germany where they will officially launch their performance tour and will film a promotional DVD.  With enough funding the group can also perform in Berlin this August.  New performance dates will be added throughout 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p>Our goal is to inspire change by building understanding, awareness, and trust between project participants and across society. </p>
<p>The project is led by Heartbeat, ActiveVision, The Willy Brandt Center in Jerusalem, Addiktz e.V., and Teater Kapija.</p>
<p>In 2010, Heartbeat, the Willy Brandt Center in Jerusalem, and ActiveVision produced the precursor to Borderline Remix, the Hip Hop Hudna, which won the Europeans for Peace 2010 award for project of the year.  The Hip Hop Hudna brought together sixteen Israeli, Palestinian and German rappers and musicians to explore the power of music to impact society, giving concerts in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Berlin, and producing True Love, a full length album of the participant's original music.  The album can be heard here: <a href=""http://heartbeatmusic.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://heartbeatmusic.bandcamp.com</a></p>
<p>With the addition of Addiktz eV from Manheim and Teater Kapija from Sweden, the Borderline Remix takes cross-cultural, cross-conflict exchange beyond all borders, fusing artistic styles and addressing deep cross-cutting social issues facing every community in every country.</p>
<p><span>This project is 100% free for participants.</span></p>
<p>A bit more about the project leaders:</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>80% of the project is already funded by Europeans for Peace and the Foundation for Remembrance, Responsibility and Future, based in Berlin.  So we are doing this project!  The question is: will we be able to include everyone and do the project as well as possible if we don't have enough money?</p>
<p>To make the project happen in full, we just need another $7000.  </p>
<p>This money would cover</p>
<ul>
<li>Making sure all of our participants and staff get there! Right now we need another $3000 just to bring all of the people who are able to come and to pay our staff a very minimal stipend for their time.</li>
<li>Professionally producing and distributing the recorded soundtrack for the Hip HOpera, to be sold as a CD at performances, and online. ($3000)  The music is going to be breathtaking. We really want the recording to be done properly.</li>
<li>We would like to be able to properly spread the word about what we're doing.  $1000 would go towards marketing, printing posters for the shows, and PR.</li>
<li>If we have even more money we can:</li>
<ul>
<li>Perform this August in Berlin ($3000)</li>
<li>Film a music video Hip HOpera trailer ($2000).</li>
<li>Pay our staff members what they actually deserve...</li>
</ul>
<li>Please check out our cool rewards.  If you have other ideas of things we can offer, please let us know!  We are open to any idea!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want this project to become a self-sustaining production capable of touring the world, building understanding, awareness and inspiring change.  We appreciate the connection with wonderful people like you around the world, and want to bring awesome, meaningful productions to you, without having to fundraise beforehand. We truly believe that this project can support itself once we get started.  This is why we need your help.</p>
<p>Our vision for the Borderline Remix is to very soon appear in a community near you, hold workshops with local artists and youth, and add each community's voices to our existing format.  The possibilities are endless.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you'd to like to support the project but can't spare the cash at this very moment, we certainly understand. There are plenty of other ways to help.  We need lots of help sharing the link to this campaign.  If you use facebook or twitter please share, tweet, post post post. Every bit helps.</p>
<p>In fact, a very powerful and easy way to help is to share the campaign with at least 5 people on FB/Twitter/word-of-mouth. </p>
<p>We also have some very cool projects starting up for interns and volunteers around the world. If you'd like to sign up to volunteer or intern with us, please email amitai@heartbeatjerusalem.org</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We are attempting to raise 25,000 dollars as part of a start up fund for our Fall kids project.  The funds will be used for:</div>
<div>1. 9000 dollars will pay our instructors for 6 months,</div>
<div>2. 7200 dollars will pay a professional director for 6 months.</div>
<div>3. 5000 dollars will pay our rent for 6 months</div>
<div>4. 3800 dollars will pay a scholarship for 4 children that are accepted into our program and in need of financial assistance.  Please see <a href=""http://youthempowermentthroughdance.blogspot.com/p/scholarship-program.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youthempowermentthroughdance.blogspot.com/p/scholarship-program.html</a> to view our scholarship program that is in desperate need of funding.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> All funds will be dispursed by Fractured Atlas for specific YEMD expenses.  The Bea Hive has been generous enough to let us use their beautiful venue for the purpose of this project at a minimum cost.  There is a giant, gorgeous dance floor with mirrors and a ballet bar.  They will post YOUR name prominently as a sponsor for any donations.  See following perks for details.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> For businesses and corporations you will get exposure to thousands of new people a year for your own business.</div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>This is our first campaign and our project starts in September 2012.  We are attempting to raise enough funds to maintain a professional staff of instructors. Your contributions will help our community to grow and prosper by supporting our kids and keeping them drug free and healthy.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is able to make a monetary donation due to our depressed economy but there are other ways you can help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the message to as many people as you know that would be able to help.</li>
<li>Offer services in other areas - we need costumes, equipment, floor mats and marketing help to get the word out.</li>
<li>You can use any of the Indiegogo share tools to help market.</li>

4. 3800 dollars will pay a scholarship for 4 children that are accepted into our program and in need of financial assistance.  Please see http://youthempowermentthroughdance.blogspot.com/p/scholarship-program.html to view our scholarship program that is in desperate need of funding.
 
 All funds will be dispursed by Fractured Atlas for specific YEMD expenses.  The Bea Hive has been generous enough to let us use their beautiful venue for the purpose of this project at a minimum cost.  There is a giant, gorgeous dance floor with mirrors and a ballet bar.  They will post YOUR name prominently as a sponsor for any donations.  See following perks for details.
 
 For businesses and corporations you will get exposure to thousands of new people a year for your own business.
The Impact
This is our first campaign and our project starts in September 2012.  We are attempting to raise enough funds to maintain a professional staff of instructors. Your contributions will help our community to grow and prosper by supporting our kids and keeping them drug free and healthy.
Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not everyone is able to make a monetary donation due to our depressed economy but there are other ways you can help.

Get the message to as many people as you know that would be able to help.
Offer services in other areas - we need costumes, equipment, floor mats and marketing help to get the word out.
You can use any of the Indiegogo share tools to help market.
Thank you for your contribution and remember that all donations are fully tax deductible to the extent of the law.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Costly Desires is the brain-child of local artist Megan Becker. She has assembled a team of local artists to produce an original multi-media piece that addresses the industry of human trafficking.<br/><p>Megan has assembled a group of passionate and talented artists she met while living, working and doing theatre in NYC and Seattle, all of whom are troubled by the scourge of modern-day slavery that is happening right here, in our backyard, perpetrated by our own US Citizens. While volunteering with local organizations who battle this issue every day, this group has become increasingly burdened by the issue of human sex trafficking, especially once they learned that Seattle was the #3 City for trafficking minors, behind only NYC and Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Being theatre and arts veterans, they wanted to raise awareness of this issue the best way they knew how: creatively and artistically. It is their hope this piece will give voice to the thousands of young women out there who are forced into prostitution, provide support for the unsung heroes on the front lines of combatting this atrocity, and move others to get involved.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Although we've received a tremendous amount of support and in-kind donations, it costs money to produce anything theatrically. We are raising funds to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Space rental and insurance.</li>
<li>Actors and creative team a small stipend to cover transportation costs.</li>
<li>Promotional items such as flyers, postcards, and programs.</li>
<li>Expenses associated with our fund-raising event.</li>
</ul>
We've had some wonderful items donated to us to assist with our fundraising efforts. That include gift cards, theatre tickets from Renton Civic Theatre and Tacoma Musical Playhouse, tickets to Pacific NW Ballet, and other wonderful items.</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
All proceeds from this production will go directly to two organizations who are fighting hard, with limited resources, to fight human slavery in Seattle:</div>

<br/><h2>About Surrealist Burlesque:</h2>
<p>Surrealist Burlesque aims to present shows that are epic, multi-disciplinary, collaborations that challenge audiences to experience entertainment with their bodies and their minds.  Surrealist Burlesque shows have been featured in the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Brooklyn Paper</em>, Animal, <em>Time Out</em>, and many others.  In 2012, Surrealist Burlesque presented Society of the Spectacular, a show inspired by Guy Debord's seminal text, <em>Society of the Spectacle</em>.  The show featured an “intimate theatre” walk through experience in the museum, live interactive music in the Freak Bar, and a show hosted by a television which was given a wine bath in the finale, a Coney Island Sideshow tradition.  As featured in <em>The New York Times</em>, in 2011 Surrealist Burlesque took over the Coney Island complex with “Animal Funhouse” based on George Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm</em>.  With a lush set –including a giant roast pig –and an epic cast of over 20 of New York City’s most spectacular nightlife creatures and burlesque stars, Animal Funhouse presented the largest and most elaborate spectacle ever staged at Coney Island USA.  In 2010, Surrealist Burlesque brought ""20,000 Legs Under the Sea"" to the Coney Island USA complex.  Inspired by Salvador Dali's “Dream of Venus” at the New York World's Fair (1939-40), “20,000 Legs Under the Sea” invited artists from a range of disciplines to collaborate on sound sculptures, video installations, mini lectures, and live performances.  Other Surrealist Burlesque shows staged at Coney Island include: “Phantasmagoria:  A Land Where All The Beauties are Monsters and All the Monsters are Beauties” (2009) and a durational performance art piece entitled “Coney Island and Spectacle as Total-Body Experience - A 12-Hour Academic Spectacular in Which We Find Our Heroine Chained to a Podium for an Interminable Period, With All the Agony and Sublime Joy That This Might Entail” (2006).</p>

Describing a flower: relative poetry more or less paper flower. Seeing....I open my heart to creation.” ― Tristan Tzara

 
Surrealist Burlesque is proud to be returning to historical Coney Island USA as part of the Burlesque at the Beach series on August 23 with it's most epic party and show to date: The Dada Ball!
 

Hosted by “Cabaret Legend” (Le Cool Magazine, Dublin) Armitage Shanks, The Dada ball is an interactive journey through the imaginary intersection of the Dada movement and the Gay Masquerade Balls popularized in the 1910s-1930s.
