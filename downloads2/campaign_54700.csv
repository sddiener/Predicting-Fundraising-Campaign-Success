<h3>What is Shisharca?</h3>
<p>Shisharca is an extraordinary pillow. It is uncommon. It is extravagant. It is crazy. It is different! It is for the people who love to feel one with the nature.</p>
<p>Shisharca is a product that combines two very powerful anti-stress techniques – good night's sleep and relaxing pine scent. It is inspired by the nature itself and it is created to bring the freshness of the evergreen pine forest in the everyday urban lifestyle.  </p>
<p>Good sleep is the key to good health and sharp brain. As we spend approximately 1/3 of our lives in sleep, we better get the maximum rest out of it. Pine trees have specific aroma which is proven to contribute to the most pleasing sense of well-being.</p>

<h3>
<br/>What actually is this thing?</h3>
<p>Shisharca is filled entirely with fresh pine shavings. The filling is made to order and stuffed in linen pillowcase. The combination of these two natural materials – linen and pinewood, makes Shisharca the ultimate organic pillow.</p>
<h3>Yes, it is naturally scented!</h3>
<p>These shavings are made of species called Pinus Nigra. In fact, the distinctive pinetree aroma is contained in the resin and this particular species is known to have a large amount of it.</p>

<h3>No, it is <i>not </i>hard!</h3>
<p>We have spent months in experiments in search of the optimal shavings’ thickness and shape. We developed a special process for creating thin and rolled pinetree shavings, and this results in softer and airy pillow.</p>

<h3>A story</h3>
<p>Shisharca is a product developed by a team of three young entrepreneurs - Ellie, Alex and Bobby, representing two small enterprises - one in the woodworking sector, and the other one in the IT sector. For three of us squeezing the last drops of energy throughout the day is a routine.</p>

<p>Having intense lifestyle and stressing about deadlines and setbacks is something normal for us.… But should it be this way?</p>
<p>The idea of a pine-scented pillow evolved naturally in response with the need for quality rest in the hectic everyday life.</p>
<p>Shisharca is inspired by a Japanese practice called shinrin-yoku, meaning “forest bathing”. Numerous studies showed that this preventive health care method reduces stress - the main cause of nearly all health problems.</p>
<p>Most of us are working some 40 hours/week. In addition, we are working on ourselves, we work on our relationships, we take care of the children, the chore, etc.</p>
<p>No matter how prepared we feel life always seem to take us by surprise and test our stress management and problem solving skills. For most of us, however, taking a long walk in the ancient Japanese forest is not doable on a daily (nor weekly) basis, but we can fake the same emotional effects by bringing the forest at home.</p>
<p>Shisharca is wonderful extension of your evening meditation routine and/or mindfulness practices as is involves an extra sense - the smell.</p>
<p>The special filling of pine shavings diffuses the aroma gradually and this specific aroma diminishes stress levels. It is like you have spent 8h outside, in the nature, you had the time to relax and recharge. Meanwhile, you haven’t left your bed! It is not a coincidence that pine tree aroma is often used in the SPA centres to relax their visitors and to provoke pleasant emotions of tranquillity and peacefulness.</p>
<h3>The process - the road from the forest to your bed.</h3>
<p>It all starts with the delivery of pine tree logs approved and controlled by Forestry in a mountainous region somewhere in the middle of Bulgaria.</p>
<p>We use a thicknesser to treat the wooden logs which are with controlled moisture content (MC) of 20+%. This way we ensure the right shape and resilience of the shavings.</p>
<p>Each Shisharca pillow is produced exclusively for its owner. Our system has only 3 easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Receive an order</li>
<li>Proceed the request</li>
<li>Confirm the date of the shipment.</li>
</ol>
<p>From the day of the confirmation, it takes up to 3 days to produce the pine shavings, to fill your Shisharca pillowcase, to pack it and ship it.</p>

<h3>Our goal</h3>
<p>Our sincere wish is to contribute for the wellbeing of as many people as possible. We are in love with Shisharca pillow and we are convinced that when you try it, you will feel the same way too!</p>
<p>In order to reach as many people as possible we will need to be loud and build a substantial online advertising campaign, build up and web store and show Shisharca to the world.</p>
<p>The money raised through this campaign will be used for covering the expenses for launching the product and online promotion.</p>

<h3>What an Embarque expansion?</h3>
<p>Embarque is an ever-growing community. Every day we witness the incredible capacity for yoga to touch lives and create long-lasting vitality, and we intend to use every day as an opportunity for more people to truly live yoga.</p>
<p>Within these first two years of being open, we have grown to the point of requiring additional studio space for our evolving community. So, we are moving forward with an ever bigger vision and expanding Embarque to a new building with incredible potential - and only one block east from our current home. However, due to the size of the project, the need for additional yoga props and our hope to build a rope wall in the main studio, the financial scope goes beyond Embarque's capacity to do it on our own.  </p>
<p>Time and time again, we have heard the calls from all of your that you are ready, willing, and wanting to offer support. And now you can!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What will the Embarque expansion offer?</h3>
<p>You will get to enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>More group yoga and meditation class offerings</li>
<li>More mat and wall space</li>
<li>Larger, main studio with rope wall</li>
<li>Second, small studio</li>
<li>Expanded yoga and wellness workshop opportunities</li>
<li>Advanced teacher trainings and continuing education</li>
<li>3 treatment rooms offering healing arts services, massages and facials</li>
<li>Welcome and reception area/desk separate from the studio</li>
<li>Ample parking and still walkable for the community</li>
<li>Additional bathroom facilities</li>
<li>More retail offerings, including yoga props and other related supplies</li>
<li>Modern apothecary retail area featuring loose-leaf tea and herbal remedies</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What are we asking for?</h3>
<p>Embarque has secured funding to begin construction; however, we'd really like to add a rope wall and invest in quality props, so we are asking for $10,000 to ensure we create the space we want for all of you. And with the magic we have witnessed within this community, we know just how possible this is.  </p>
<p>Any and all support for the Embarque Yoga + Wellness Studio Expansion will go directly into the project itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rope Wall</li>
<li>Yoga props (i.e., bolsters, sandbags, blankets)</li>
<li>Contractor fees </li>
<li>General construction (flooring, walls, painting, etc.)</li>
<li>Furniture and necessary furnishings</li>
</ul>
<p>The perks are designed to offer you, our contributors, all the things you already love about the studio - including classes, memberships, and Embarque merchandise. </p>
<p><i>*Class and membership perks are transferable to another name. Unclaimed class and membership perks expire December 31, 2017. </i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why yoga?</h3>
<p>In the conversations happening throughout our community and the transformations experienced in Embarque classes and trainings, we have seen the power that comes with the practice of yoga. This practice has proven to affect change in individual lives, Indianapolis and beyond. And with that, Embarque stands firm in our vision to keep our studio and offerings inclusive and available to any and all who wish to experience and share the power of yoga.   </p>
<p>And it all starts with our physical space. This new space will make it possible for us to invite more people into our community, and to continue expanding the offerings that support all of you and the effect yoga and holistic health has everyone.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways you can support us!</h3>
<p>We are so grateful for your everyday contributions to Embarque. If you are unable to support us financially at this time, please share this campaign with your community, family, and friends through the social media share tools. Your willingness to share this project and ask for support on our behalf is of incredible value to our mission. And we thank you for that. </p>
<p>We are so grateful to all of your. We would not be who we are without you. </p>

It also alarms you when there are dramatic changes in the air.Based on the previous successful multi-award winning product of AirComfort, we spent months developing AirQuality to provide more information in helping users to further understand the air they breathe and, make the right changes.Turn on the fan, open the window, or turn off the air-conditioner.Sometimes, it is all those small steps that bring big changes.Air pollution is the infamous invisible killer in the city.Each year, an estimated of 6.5 million people died because of both indoor and outdoor air pollution.Indoor air pollution alone causes an estimation of 4.3 million premature deaths per year.Every breath matters.Especially when you breathe up to 30,000 times every day until the very last moment. How you breathe, is then, how you live.Especially when we spend, on average, more than 70 years of our lives indoors.In other words, most of your breaths are/will be breathed in indoors.#1: It alarms you when there is change in environment#2: It helps to make the right change#3: It reminds you when action is neededInspired by the look of a plant, AirQuality 'inhale' air and 'exhale' information and data.

She is a leading global authority on using behavioural therapy, involving galvanic skin response and electrodermal activity biofeedback, to address epilepsy. Her research started in 1997. </p><p>In 2016, Dr Nagai received the Clinical Science Gowers Award from the International League Against Epilepsy, UK, in recognition of her ongoing research to better understand mind and body interaction in epilepsy. She developed many of the techniques used in the ACRT course by working one on one with patients with drug-resistant epilepsy over 20 years.</p><p><i>“It has been very rewarding working with my patients, but at the same time frustrating that I don’t have enough time to help more people. I would like to make my therapy directly available to people with drug resistant epilepsy, by building this online platform and offering it to the whole community. My vision is to establish a truly patient focused new epilepsy care service.  ” – Dr Yoko Nagai</i></p><div style=""margin:20px 0px;padding-top:10px;""> </div><h2 style=""color:#F5A500;text-align: center;"">What is ACRT?</h2><p style=""text-align: left;""> </p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p style=""text-align: left;"">ACRT is a behavioural therapy for self-help and seizure management. The therapy embodies both physiological and psychological approaches. Our thoughts and emotions are closely linked to our bodily responses and behaviour. Events in our daily lives trigger thoughts that in turn give rise to emotions. These emotions have the power to change both our bodily stress responses and our behaviour.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446129965/snrfw6esykubhzgvgvtj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Psychological treatments, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), argue that psychological distress is caused by ways of thinking that trigger negative emotions and unhelpful behaviours. CBT helps you identify these distorted thoughts and correct them so that you can apply a more realistic and balanced way of thinking.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">ACRT extends this CBT model by also taking a more holistic account of the role of the body in the expression of emotions and thoughts, and by working directly on the physiological aspects of wellbeing.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Published research shows that more than 80% of people with epilepsy consider stress and anxiety to be a major factor in causing seizures. It is therefore very important to understand the mechanisms of how the mind, brain and body interact. Drug treatments on their own cannot give this understanding</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Using ACRT, you will see how your body responds to different thoughts and emotions. By receiving visual feedback about how your body reacts, you will be able to train yourself to become more sensitive to your bodily reactions and control your body’s state of alertness. Through this process, you will also learn how to stabilise your emotions.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""> </p><h3>Who is it for?</h3><p style=""text-align: left;"">People with epilepsy who experience brief auras are particularly good candidates for this type of therapy. However this is by no means a requirement for a successful outcome. There are people without any aura who reduce the frequency of their seizures by more than two thirds after a month of therapy.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">A modified set of instructions is given in the platform for those people who do not have an aura. People whose seizures occur predominantly with stress, anxiety and low mood are also good candidates. Unfortunately, clinical experience suggests that ACRT in its present form does not work as well for people who have a significant learning disability. </p><p style=""text-align: left;""> </p><h2 style=""color:#F5A500;text-align: center;"">Previously reported on (click logo to read):</h2><p style=""padding:30px 20px 50px 20px;text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.bsms.ac.uk/about/news/pulse-magazine/index.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_300/c_limit,h_50/v1449742540/kocqfdkrnc5zbfimp4df.png"" src="""" style=""padding:5px;""/></a> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BBCSouthEastToday/videos/10153861521588648/?theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_300/c_limit,h_50/v1453889084/lqwz8pso4wfrjx11vo2v.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/12/151206164750.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_250/c_limit,h_50/v1449757568/psqm8rjrkcrqoqi2mz0x.png"" src="""" style=""padding:5px;""/></a> <a href=""http://www.sussex.ac.uk/broadcast/read/33310"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_300/c_limit,h_53/v1449742551/kduwt26bsxopcqbls6mv.png"" src="""" style=""padding:5px;""/></a> <a href=""http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/AES/55092"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_300/c_limit,h_50/v1449742763/rvicpd4ypgynvak7s79v.jpg"" src="""" style=""padding:5px;""/></a> <a href=""http://www.medscape.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_300/c_limit,h_50/v1449780214/bggbrs58rznxic3zlcrw.png"" src="""" style=""padding:5px;height: 52px;""/></a> <a href=""http://www.neurologyreviews.com/?id=24816&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=464825&amp;cHash=5dc1afedaab1667bec492d5f922c39db"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_300/c_limit,h_50/v1449742745/uykzmn8smrbqhkrhjcxg.png"" src="""" style=""padding:5px;""/></a> <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/303646.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_300/c_limit,h_50/v1449742781/heqbj6qcxdvgfttpwpqf.jpg"" src="""" style=""padding:5px;""/></a> <a rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_300/c_limit,h_50/v1452185220/iftmczjio8dhzqdu5zal.jpg"" src="""" style=""padding:10px;""/></a> <a href=""http://naturalpresswire.com/new-epilepsy-therapy-842"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_300/c_limit,h_50/v1449742798/q1sxozogvenezjj1ma1n.jpg"" src="""" style=""padding:20px 5px 5px;""/></a> <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3424625/Lie-detector-game-helps-reduce-epileptic-fits-Subjects-hooked-polygraph-machine-make-computer-character-just-minds.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_300/c_limit,h_50/v1455110336/s5nivb1ttbusojgsadnv.jpg"" src="""" style=""padding:10px;""/></a></p><h2 style=""color:#F5A500;text-align: center;"">Research and results</h2><p>Dr Nagai's research started with investigations into how brain and peripheral body reactions are related each other.

This new therapy, ACRT, is effective, non-invasive and affordable - based on 20 years of cutting-edge neuroscientific research in the UK. We are excited to launch this new service worldwide as our ultimate goal is to foster a global community of support for patients. Your help will enable us to offer affordable access to therapy for tens of thousands of people with drug-resistant epilepsy.  You will be able to access the ACRT platform on any connected device – desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone. The only additional technology required is biofeedback equipment for measuring galvanic skin response (GSR) / electrodermal activity (EDA). This can consist of either electrode sensors or wearables , which are included with several of the reward packages for this campaign. ImportantIt is important to use one of several Biofeedback Global recommended GSR/EDA biofeedback devices for ACRT therapy, with our instruction. Many currently available devices are marketed for relaxation purposes, and are not suitable for seizure management. Learning seizure management at home  ACRT is a behavioural therapy developed to help manage seizures. Through 12 interactive sessions, you will learn a specific set of skills to manage seizures. Once you have obtained these skills, the effect can last for many years. Each session takes about 45 minutes, and for best results we recommend allocating three sessions per week, over a 4-week period. During each session, you will receive instructions and practice the technique, which you can then start to apply in your daily life.IntroductionFirst, a comprehensive introduction will instruct you how to work through the ACRT sessions. Session 1  In session one, you will learn some basic knowledge to familiarise yourself with biofeedback training. Session 2   From session two onwards, you will start learning techniques to manage your seizures. See the “Research and Results” section below for published trial results that demonstrate the effect of ACRT has had on different patients’ seizures - individual seizure frequency changes. Many people start to experience changes in the frequency and severity of their seizures over the course of the sessions, often during the first week. About Dr NagaiDr Yoko Nagai is a neuroscientist based at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School, and a director of Biofeedback Global. She is a leading global authority on using behavioural therapy, involving galvanic skin response and electrodermal activity biofeedback, to address epilepsy. Her research started in 1997. In 2016, Dr Nagai received the Clinical Science Gowers Award from the International League Against Epilepsy, UK, in recognition of her ongoing research to better understand mind and body interaction in epilepsy. She developed many of the techniques used in the ACRT course by working one on one with patients with drug-resistant epilepsy over 20 years.“It has been very rewarding working with my patients, but at the same time frustrating that I don’t have enough time to help more people. I would like to make my therapy directly available to people with drug resistant epilepsy, by building this online platform and offering it to the whole community. My vision is to establish a truly patient focused new epilepsy care service.  ” – Dr Yoko Nagai What is ACRT? How does it work?ACRT is a behavioural therapy for self-help and seizure management. The therapy embodies both physiological and psychological approaches. Our thoughts and emotions are closely linked to our bodily responses and behaviour. Events in our daily lives trigger thoughts that in turn give rise to emotions. These emotions have the power to change both our bodily stress responses and our behaviour. Psychological treatments, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), argue that psychological distress is caused by ways of thinking that trigger negative emotions and unhelpful behaviours. CBT helps you identify these distorted thoughts and correct them so that you can apply a more realistic and balanced way of thinking.ACRT extends this CBT model by also taking a more holistic account of the role of the body in the expression of emotions and thoughts, and by working directly on the physiological aspects of wellbeing.Published research shows that more than 80% of people with epilepsy consider stress and anxiety to be a major factor in causing seizures. It is therefore very important to understand the mechanisms of how the mind, brain and body interact. Drug treatments on their own cannot give this understandingUsing ACRT, you will see how your body responds to different thoughts and emotions. By receiving visual feedback about how your body reacts, you will be able to train yourself to become more sensitive to your bodily reactions and control your body’s state of alertness. Through this process, you will also learn how to stabilise your emotions. Who is it for?People with epilepsy who experience brief auras are particularly good candidates for this type of therapy. However this is by no means a requirement for a successful outcome. There are people without any aura who reduce the frequency of their seizures by more than two thirds after a month of therapy.A modified set of instructions is given in the platform for those people who do not have an aura. People whose seizures occur predominantly with stress, anxiety and low mood are also good candidates. Unfortunately, clinical experience suggests that ACRT in its present form does not work as well for people who have a significant learning disability.  Previously reported on (click logo to read):          Research and resultsDr Nagai's research started with investigations into how brain and peripheral body reactions are related each other. We think that when our brain gets excited, our body does too, but this is not always the case.Dr Nagai measures and observes a body signal called Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) /electrodermal activity (EDA) which is very sensitive to our thoughts and emotions. You may know already that GSR/EDA is used in lie detector tests. Dr Nagai’s research has extensively investigated how changes in GSR/EDA also modulate different brain signals. To this end Dr Nagai has applied tools including electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI). For people who would like to know more about the ACRT, you can find selected list of Dr Nagai's publications at (http://biofeedbackglobal.org/science/).

The functional activity of distinct brain regions changes over the course of the therapy. Our research shows that one month of ACRT training increases resilience of people to anxiety-related seizure attacks.

Over the past six months I have really come to grips with how lucky I was to be born and raised in a country like Canada. I was fortunate enough to live in safe neighbourhoods, go to well funded schools, and play organized sports ever since I can remember. I also have realized the childhood I had is very different than what many children around the world are experiencing. I studied poverty and its relation to sport in developing countries, and ultimately took in interest in The Gambia, Africa's smallest mainland country, located on the Western coast of the continent. I learned that in The Gambia, over one third of the countries population lives on under $1.25 per day. Like many African countries, they are extremely passionate about soccer, but a real soccer ball is often a rarity. I learned that soccer balls are often fashioned by the children using garbage bags, string, clothing, and any other materials readily available to them.</p>
<p>With all of this information in mind, I went to work to develop a business that would not only help to solve this problem in The Gambia, but also put a great product in the hands of those who, like myself, benefited from the luxuries of growing up in a developed country. My Greatest Play is a clothing brand that consumers can be proud to wear, and dawn it knowing they provided a real soccer ball to children who may have never used one before.</p>

He said he stopped in a school of 2,700 students, and learned that the school had one soccer ball for the entire student body. This soccer ball was taken care of a person who worked at the school, their title? Soccer Ball Manager. The soccer ball manager was to protect the ball at all times, and also make sure the girls were not able to play with the ball. The reasoning behind it was that girls in this part of the country had no chance of going pro or receiving a university scholarship, therefor them having access of the ball was considered a waste.</p>
<p>Stories like this are what fuel our company, and put into prospective that one small donation or just one clothing item sold can make a world of a difference to those living in Africa's poorest countries.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The Yoga 4 Homeless mission is to bring the healing power of yoga to homeless men, women and children worldwide. Our team believes that yoga can provide a path toward personal transformation and equip homeless people with the tools they need to get off the streets and become functional in society. </span></p>
<p>Yoga 4 Homeless was started by Andrew Beinbrink in December 2015 with a simple goal to donate yoga mats to the homeless so they wouldn’t have to sleep on the cold, concrete during the winter. After providing yoga mats to homeless in the San Diego community and hearing how much better they slept Andrew was inspired to provide more than yoga mats. </p>
<p>Once the project started building more momentum, the next logical step was to partner with a number of yoga studios and local businesses including Lululemon. Realizing mats weren't enough, we spoke with local homeless shelters and community centers and saw the opportunity to bring the healing practice of yoga into the homeless community. </p>After a few months of research and studying the homeless epidemic, we decided to focus our efforts on bringing yoga teachers and classes to homeless shelters and community centers. We are currently working with a few shelters and homeless community centers in California and Texas and looking to aggressively expand. </div><div>We are also establishing a Yoga 4 Homeless teacher training program and curriculum that we will be able to take to different communities and establish more qualified teachers. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""><b> </b> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""> <b> </b></span>

To Bring the Healing Power of Yoga to Homeless Men, Women, and Children Worldwide. 

Yoga 4 Homeless is a non-profit project so your tax deductible contribution will allow us to provide yoga mats, classes and yoga instructors to guide classes for homeless in cities near you.




Right now the homeless epidemic is the worst it has ever been affecting over 100 million worldwide.  Homeless men, women and children are often dealing with significant personal challenges including traumatic stress, drug and alcohol abuse, mental illness, sleep deprivation and depression. 
Yoga has been proven to reduce: traumatic stress, addictive behavior, depression, mental illness, diabetes, and insomnia.
Five Powerful Benefits to Yoga: 
1. Yoga empowers the homeless to take action
2. Yoga increases a homeless person's self-esteem 
3. Yoga improves the ability to mentally and emotionally function in society
4. Yoga gives homeless a sense of community and well being
5. Yoga improves a homeless person's physical health and mobility 
Your contribution of $5 or more will allow us to provide yoga mats, classes and yoga instructors to guide classes for homeless in cities near you.
Yoga 4 Homeless Infographic & Model for Transformation


I think we all can agree that yoga is a powerful tool for the struggles the homeless face.  Yoga can help provide a foundation toward better mental, physical and emotional health with a higher quality of life. 


You can change a life, and it’s simpler and easier than you would have ever imagined.

Our Vision


Right now there is NO cohesive initiative with adequate funding and resources that provides free yoga to serve the hundreds of thousands of homeless that could benefit from the practice. Just imagine if every homeless shelter or community center nationwide and eventually worldwide was offering free yoga as a healing practice for men, women and children. 
Your contribution will go directly toward providing yoga teachers and classes into homeless shelters and community centers to help reduce trauma, stress and addictive behaviors within the homeless community. 


Yoga 4 Homeless is establishing a scalable model to do the following: 
1. Raise massive awareness regarding the homeless epidemic
2. Recruit & train yoga teachers to teach yoga to the homeless 
3. Create working partnerships with homeless shelters and community centers to offer yoga for free to homeless men, women and children
4. Build partnerships with yoga studios, yoga related and non-related companies to support the cause
5. Establish a Yoga 4 Homeless teacher training program to build a large network of certified yoga teachers around the world to teach yoga to the homeless






Listen to a Yoga Instructor talk about the Power Yoga has on the Homeless



Millions of Americans take classes to learn the poses and breathing of the ancient Indian practice of yoga. In recent years, yoga organizations have been reaching out to people who may not normally have the opportunity to take yoga classes, such as the homeless, trauma survivors, and people with drug and alcohol addictions. VOA's Deborah Block visited Green Door, a small mental health center in Washington where yoga is helping change people's lives for the better.

In the Press
The Yoga 4 Homeless has been an inspiring story that has caught the attention of numerous media outlets with more inbound interest everyday. 







Our Progress
In just three short months we are working with multiple homeless shelters in CA and TX and positioned to bring the healing practice of yoga to thousands of homeless men, women and children. Here is a news feature of founder Andrew Beinbrink passing out mats walking the streets in downtown San Diego East Village. The mats are very helpful for sleeping on instead of sleeping on the cold concrete.

About Yoga 4 Homeless 


The Yoga 4 Homeless mission is to bring the healing power of yoga to homeless men, women and children worldwide. Our team believes that yoga can provide a path toward personal transformation and equip homeless people with the tools they need to get off the streets and become functional in society. 
Yoga 4 Homeless was started by Andrew Beinbrink in December 2015 with a simple goal to donate yoga mats to the homeless so they wouldn’t have to sleep on the cold, concrete during the winter. After providing yoga mats to homeless in the San Diego community and hearing how much better they slept Andrew was inspired to provide more than yoga mats. 
Once the project started building more momentum, the next logical step was to partner with a number of yoga studios and local businesses including Lululemon. Realizing mats weren't enough, we spoke with local homeless shelters and community centers and saw the opportunity to bring the healing practice of yoga into the homeless community. After a few months of research and studying the homeless epidemic, we decided to focus our efforts on bringing yoga teachers and classes to homeless shelters and community centers. We are currently working with a few shelters and homeless community centers in California and Texas and looking to aggressively expand. We are also establishing a Yoga 4 Homeless teacher training program and curriculum that we will be able to take to different communities and establish more qualified teachers.

   Risks & Challenges  
Yoga 4 Homeless started in December to help support the homeless through the practice of yoga.  Being a new nonprofit means we have a team that is committed  to make the largest positive impact on the homeless we can.
The risks and challenges that we might encounter include resistance from local shelters to be able to implement a program such as yoga for homeless based on limited space staff or resources.
Our experience: In three short months we have partnered with four homeless shelters and community centers and have been met with warm reception. Yoga becomes a no cost community program to help their clients mentally, physically and emotionally. 
There's also a risk that the homeless participation will be very low and that the program will not be adopted and successful enough to continue.
Our experience: Homeless men, women and children are dealing with significant challenges and yoga offers a way to lower their stress level and also exercise in a safe comfortable environment. Our program so far has been met with enthusiasm from our homeless neighbors: 
Another risk is we are not able to find enough yoga teachers that are willing to teach the homeless. 
Our experience: We have had an outpouring of support from the yoga community and have already created a waiting list for yoga teachers. This prompted us to start developing a teacher training curriculum for Yoga 4 Homeless. 
The final risk is if we aren't able to receive the ongoing funding by corporate partnerships or private donations for the project. 
Our funding plan: We will utilize a
multi-pronged fundraising approach to raise money for our program with a year
around campaign model.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We have confidence in our product design and manufacturability, and have actually produced a couple of units, but as with any hardware project, there are always potential risks associated with large scale manufacturing and supply chain logistics </p>
<p>To minimize the risk, we will work with an experienced contract manufacturer who specializes in mass production.</p>
<p>We initially wanted the Rocker to be a 2017 Xmas gift, but to accommodate potential slippages in manufacturing and logistics we have pushed our delivery date to March, 2018. If all goes well though we might; just might be able to deliver for 2017 xmas. </p>
<p>Whatever happens, we will keep our dear backers informed.</p>

How long do you remain seated in a day? A week? You begin to get the picture.  Many office base workers are inevitably at great risk of sedimentary diseases.Take a look around you, how many people do you know that spend their time seated for extended periods of time? Our modern lifestyle means we spend several hours a day on a seat, in front of the computer, TV, on a video game, when we travel; we are seated for unhealthy lengths of time. Some journeys, like by Air; there is no option of a break, UK to Australia, 16 hours direct flight time; will be spent seated on one spot. That’s purely unhealthy. By doing so, we dramatically increase the load and strain on our organs, necks and spine. Under this continual pressure and strain our body suffer under the toll.According to Dr Clare Morrison, GP at online pharmacy MedExpress, sitting down for long periods can “lead to muscle atrophy in the leg and gluteal areas, where the muscles weaken and waste away”. [3]“Prolonged sitting can lead to poor circulation, this could lead to swollen ankles, varicose veins and even deep vein thrombosis (DVT). - Steve Iley, medical director of Bupa UK.

I used to be a BBC war correspondent.  I’ve covered death and disaster all over the world. I believe you can imagine the pain and trauma I’ve witnessed.  To help me deal with what I'd experienced, I started practicing mindfulness. It was eye opening. It felt like I had been given a superpower. I wished I’d had this toolkit as a child. At the time, I'd been exploring virtual reality.I loved how VR took me away from my surroundings. I was fully immersed and engaged. It was then that an idea began brewing...What about bringing mindfulness to teens in a way they'd want to do it; maybe by combining virtual reality and mindfulness. That is how Take-Pause was born.   2 Years On Now, two years on we have successfully completed a clinical trial in the pediatric emergency room at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn. The single blind study foundthat using Take-Pausereduces pediatric patient anxiety by 45%.    How it worksIt’s simple. It is a breathing and focus exercise with a character and a scene.There is little to do, just like mindfulness. There is no gamification - because we all have enough success or failure scenarios in our life. In Take-Pause, there is no doing it wrong. Even just sitting in the headset is relaxing and provides a break in the moment, and if you want to follow the character, it's even more beneficial.  How you use Take-PauseFirst the headset goes on, then choose a character, and then choose a scene. It’s that straightforward.  It's engaging and helpful. We call it health by stealth.  Hospitals, Clinics, Private Practices Although we plan to introduce this into schools and universities, and even in homes, our initial focus will be with pediatric patients.  We plan to make every child's visit just a little bit less stressful, just a little bit less scary.     Did you know...- Every year 30 million kids visit the emergency room in the US alone. Another 16 million visit urgent care centers?That means 46 million children need emergency medical help every year.  Do you remember visiting doctors and hospitals as a kid? One particular incident has remained with me from those years; I was 14, I had scraped the back of my knee and it was not healing. My parents were taking me to the doctor. It was nothing serious, but on the way to the clinic, I sat in the back of the car with tears quietly streaming down my face because I listened to my worst imaginings.  Years down the road, I still remember that anxiety. Research shows:- Anxiety can make pain worse and can make it difficult to cope with the pain.- Anxiety can makes it harder to communicate the problem to a doctor or nurse.- Anxiety can slow down the healing and recovery process. We’ve built Take Pausespecifically for these high stress moments.  Clinical ValidationWe began by informally piloting in Orange Regional Medical Center to great results.  Then a clinical trial of Take-Pause began in the pediatric emergency room at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn. Maimonides was just voted one of the top hospitals in the country for clinical excellence.   The goal of the study was to test whether Take-Pause reduced anxiety and if it did by how much. The trial has just been completed.  It's official Take-Pause reduces anxietyfor pediatric patients in the emergency room. In fact, Take-Pause was significantly more effective in reducing anxietythan the control option - which was watching a video on an I-pad.  The product We have developed a subscription based medical use platform. It's an easy to use plug and play system that brings together science and art, and it is almost ready for launch.  It combines, the hardware, the content, and a data portal to allow the doctor or individual to track progress.  We will sell the hardware as a bundle, and then the content will be available on a choice of monthly subscription plans.     Our TeamWe have 2 neuroscientists on our team, one of whom is also a clinical psychologist and mindfulness expert.  All of these people have very kindly given of their time and skills to get Take-Pause to this level.We’ve co-created the look with students Created by kids for kids. Although of course we let adults use it too!  Why mindfulness?A mindfulness practice helps us for life. Research has shown that mindfulness helps reduce aggression and anxiety.But we all sometimes find it tough to focus. Teens are no better. This is where virtual reality came in.  Why in virtual reality?It's immersive. It's easy to do.  It's an attractive choice for a teenager; hacking calm with technology.There was another reason to choosing virtual reality, it is not just a toy. There is decades of medical research around virtual reality. ""Over 30 years of academic research and over 3000 studies demonstrate that VR can improve behaviors, attitudes, and health."" Dr. Walter Greenleaf, Neuroscientist, Stanford University.The explanation as to why virtual reality has been largely in the realm of research up to now, was that headsets were too clunky and expensive to be easily adopted.  Today headsets are portable and affordable.   VR in health care is set to become standard very soon. So the idea of combining mindfulness; which is clinically proven to reduce anxiety, with virtual reality; a technology that has been clinically proven to reduce anxiety, seemed like - if you excuse the pun - a no brainer! Mindfulness + Virtual Reality = TAKE-PAUSE Why we need your support We need some rocket fuel to finish the product.  Our plan is to first introduce Take-Pause to 5 launching partners - which would be hospitals, medical centers, and private practices. Then we will move to expand around the country. Feel free to get in touch if you can connect us to a place that may be able to use Take-Pause. We've come so far,  and we're almost there. Now we need your help, to get us into orbit.Either way we'll continue, but we'd love your help on this journey.  In specifics your money will go to:
optimizing the experiences 
streamlining the data flow from the headset to the website
introducing it to doctors and nurses at medical conferences 
introducing it to hospitals and private practices
 Goal Maybe with Take-Pause kids will remember their hospital visit without the fear normally associated with such visits. Maybe they’ll feel more confident and resilient.    How cool would it be that instead of asking for a pain killer, they ask for a bit of Take-Pause. Together we can create positive impact.  Perks As part of the perks, we are giving access to specific segments of our subscription system without needing to get a subscription! If you have a virtual reality headset, you can enjoy the full VR experience. If you don't have a headset we have set it up so you can use this on a smart phone. It'll still be calming, but not as immersive and engaging. Thank You! You're great. $10 USDA personal e-mail to say thank you. You are helping us on our mission to reduce teenage anxiety.Stillness$25 USDThis is a bitesize offering of our healthcare product. A customized 15 minute experience with unlimited access.

Also, prolongs the youthful appearance of the skin by removing the skin compression to which is exposed while sleeping. GRAVITY EFFECT  The force of gravity exerts a tightening effect on our skin when you sleep on your back that is reflected in smoother skin every morning.

<h3><strong>Improved Health Outcomes For Everyone</strong></h3>
<p>As a dental surgeon, I have a 30-year history of delivering improved health outcomes for thousands of my patients. The videos I have designed help my patients better understand why dental care is important to their overall health.</p>
<p>For example, the first day I ran my video about the connection between bruxism and headaches in my waiting room, two patients made inquiries about how their headaches can be relieved with dental care! How awesome is that?</p>
<p>If every dental practice in the world was running that video, imagine how many fewer headache sufferers there would be worldwide!</p>
<p>I want to share my success and expertise on how to educate dental patients and get better treatment acceptance rates with this easy to use waiting room dental video app. I truly believe my dental colleagues can make a real and measurable health improvement to millions of patients all over the world with the right tools to help them.</p>
<p>PVC is poised to revolutionize how dental practices connect with their patients worldwide! In the waiting room. On their website. On social media. And at a fraction of the time and cost of traditional video media. By early 2020 PVC will help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliver messages and effectively educate the importance of dental care to the patient's overall health.</li>
<li>Customize and brand educational videos and special offers in minutes.</li>
<li>Allow businesses to <i>automatically</i> update their information across all platforms- from the waiting room to their websites and even youtube.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is an indisputable fact that the highest uptake and retention of content is achieved when content is delivered using video. In a study by Insivia, viewers retain 95% of a message when they watch it in a video, compared to 10% when reading it in text. And a Cisco report predicts that by 2022, online videos will make up more than 82% of all consumer internet traffic — 15 times higher than it was in 2017.</p>
<p>My main goal is to make video animation easy and affordable for dental practices. Affordable messaging makes information more accessible. As a result, more people worldwide will be made aware of how improving their dental health will have a direct benefit to their overall health and enjoyment of life. </p>
<p>That is where my program comes in. PVC is an app that creates animated videos I play on my waiting room TV screen. These videos provide waiting patients with education and information like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oral Health Care Tips and Instructions</li>
<li>Education on the correlation between oral health and your overall health</li>
<li>Introducing our team members to new and returning patients</li>
<li>Special offers we have running at our practice</li>
</ul>
<p>I've taken the most successful and effective ones, turned them into customizable templates, and made them available to customize and brand in minutes for my colleagues to do the same. I made them easily editable and automatically update anywhere they are embedded with the click of a button. All for a fraction of the price of a single custom video animation from traditional sources.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>During beta testing, I identified some important changes that will help users of the app create videos in just a few clicks, with improved customization options. The ease of use of the app is essential to encouraging dental practices to use it. More video usage will mean the dental health messages in the videos will reach more people.</p>
<p>We need to raise $285,864 to fund the following, please help!</p>

<p>The program will not stop at dental offices. Once we have launched the dental health education tier of the App, we will use any additional funding to build education tiers for medical, podiatry, physiotherapy, chiropractic, and more.

<h3>The Impact Worldwide</h3>
<p>Broad-based delivery of dental health education will undoubtedly benefit the entire world population. Thousands of my patients have put their trust in me over the past 30 years, and by focusing on improving their health I never let them down.</p>
<p>Now I ask you to trust me as my patients have. Join me on my journey to drive improved health for humankind in a practical and affordable app program that benefits both the practice and their patients.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The main risk is the initial cost. As with any software development, the initial costing and timeline or the development are never 100% correct. It is possible I may need more funds and more time to properly finish the app before launch. If this happens, I may need to reach out for more funding and ask for more time from my contributors to deliver their Perks.</p>
<p>The first quote I got to develop my App idea some two years ago was $4000... yeah right! I did not believe them, so I contacted a developer I have worked with some years back to develop an online appointment making app, and I asked them to quote on the development. Their initial quote came in at $36,000 and my wife almost divorced me when I agreed to fund it from our own money. However, I decided to go with them because they had developed and launched what is now a very successful app called HikeUp.com. Of course, even those costs rose significantly over the course of development.</p>
<p>I am prepared, willing, able and do devote almost every waking hour of my life outside working as a dentist to performing development tasks required to get this app finished and to market. My promise to you is that I will continue to do this until the app is launched and will not draw any salary for me from the funds collected here. It will ALL go to developing and maintaining the app.</p>

As a dental surgeon, I have a 30-year history of delivering improved health outcomes for thousands of my patients. The videos I have designed help my patients better understand why dental care is important to their overall health.
For example, the first day I ran my video about the connection between bruxism and headaches in my waiting room, two patients made inquiries about how their headaches can be relieved with dental care! How awesome is that?
If every dental practice in the world was running that video, imagine how many fewer headache sufferers there would be worldwide!

It has been intensified due to the rapid rise in global migration. It is time to change our living habits to reduce the ways to spread.Copperman's simple design makes it easy to store the face mask without touching its surface with both hands. The mask is stored in heightened personal hygiene, to avoid touching anything else in the public. We often use our hands to open and close doors, press buttons (elevator, ATM and payment machine). Copperman design is fully matched with various applications through different designs. To change our living habits a little, it can reduce the chance of transmission.ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF COFFERCopper and its alloys are natural antimicrobial material. Ancient civilizations exploited the antimicrobial properties of copper long before the concept of microbes became understood in the nineteenth century. In addition to several copper medicinal preparations, it was also observed centuries ago that water contained in copper vessels or transported in copper conveyance systems was of better quality than water contained or transported in other materials. COPPER TOUCH SURFACEAntimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces can prevent frequently touched surfaces from serving as reservoirs for the spread of microbes. This is especially true in healthcare facilities, where harmful bacteria colonises and persists on doorknobs, push plates, railings, tray tables, tap (faucet) handles, and other equipment. These microbes can sometimes survive on surfaces for more than 30 days. The design of Copperman is portable, dynamic, and multi-purpose applications. Copperman integrates the design into your personal belongings, such as lipstick and keychain. It can enhance personal hygiene that reduces the chance of public contacts.Given face mask shortage crisis, Copperman specially designs two face mask storage holders, allowing you to put the mask where it is always hygienic. It is reusable and easy keeping on day to day basis. By such, we do not wrap the mask with other single-use items. And, we will not consume with panic buying and hoarding such as tissue paper, envelope and zipper bag. Copperman always appreciates with earth protecting on product design.Copperman would become a part of everyone's life. It can reduce the risk of transmission caused by contact with any object in public. It can also narrow the risk of secondary transmission; especially harmful bacteria. Copperman face mask holder, Mask Pad and Mask Clip, is a temporary storage of face mask. It is made of the metal of Copper. Copper can lower the activity level of bacteria spreading wisely. After taking off the face mask, store into the Mask Pad/ Mask Clip to calm the germ activity. It allows to reuse the same mask with better hygiene condition. Copperman reassures you to wear the same mask. Last but not the least, Mask Pad/ Mask Clip can minimise the mask to spread the germs in public and narrow the risk of getting secondary transmission.Remark:1. Ensure the face mask to be stored in Copperman is in good condition. Once damaged such as the mask has been wet or damaged, it is not suitable for use.2. The key feature of Copperman is to suppress bacteria in the face mask holder and reduce the risk of secondary transmission of inflection. It is not to suppress bacteria on the surface and inside of the face mask.  Why we wear surgical masks is to avoid getting sick, and to avoid others getting sick. The face mask shortage crisis makes everyone wear the same mask more than one time. Since we cannot wear face mask 24 hours a day, and we usually take off the masks for the mask-free break, for instance, lunchtime and drinking water.By observation, the taking-off mask lies on the tissue paper and put on the table. Or, the mask will be placed inside the reusable bag, or just putting the naked mask into the jacket pocket. With these short period storage, they are not promising for good personal hygiene. It could even be considered as a great leakage of bacteria spreading.  With the supporting of researches and reports, it states the metal of copper can inhibit the growth of bacteria.REPORTS FROM ASSOCIATIONS Copper is a chemical element with a symbol of Cu. It is a soft, malleable metal. Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form (native metals). The cultural role of copper has been important. Ancient Egyptians (2400BC) used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water.On February 29, 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved the registrations of five different groups of copper alloys as ""antimicrobial materials"" with public health benefits. The EPA registrations now cover 479 different compositions of copper alloys within six groups. All of the alloys have minimum nominal copper concentrations of 60%. The results of the EPA-supervised antimicrobial studies demonstrating copper's strong antimicrobial efficacies across a wide range of alloys have been published.Copper and its alloys exhibit impressive antibacterial properties. Copper has been exploited for health purposes since ancient times. The process involves the release of copper ions (electrically charged particles) when microbes, transferred by touching, land on the copper surface. The ions prevent cell respiration, punch holes in the bacterial cell membrane or disrupt the bacterial coat, and destroy the DNA and RNA inside.The process involves the release of copper ions when microbes (bacteria) were exposed to copper surface (land on the copper surface). It disrupts bacterial cell membranes. Copper ions prevent cell respiration, punch holes in the bacterial cell membranes. It generates oxidative stress on bacterial cells, and Copper readily catalyzes reactions that result in the production of hydroxyl radicals.  And it also interferes with the proteins that operate important functions, thereby inhibiting their activities.Copperman allows you think out of the box. Copperman integrates “Stick As You Go” into your personal belongings. It gives extra protection to avoid any direct touching in public. “Stick As You Go” allows you to stimulate your creativity on where to stick; for instance, hand sanitizer and smartphone. Copperman provides the best solution for you to design your own daily use product to become hygiene. Copperman adopts as a part of your life with slightly change that can reduce the change of inflectious spread.Besides, Copperman specially design two kinds of face mask holders, Mask Pad and Mask Clip. With the concept of “zero touching” mask surface, it is the simplest way to keep the mask in a better hygiene. Copperman reassures you to wear the same mask.Having a Copperman face mask holder (Mask Pad/ Mask Clip), it is to avoid any direct skin contact to the surface of bacteria on the face mask. Taking off the mask with the earlobe elastic bands, and place the mask into the Mask Pad/ Mask Clip. When the mask is sitting inside the case peacefully, the copper ions can cause a series of negative events in bacterial cells. Copper ions released from the surface have been proposed to play a major role in the bacteria inhibition effect.Copperman face mask holder shares a similar size of a long wallet (Mask Pad), a foldable wallet (Mask Clip). It not only simplifies the step from the misuse short term storage, but Copperman face mask holder is also washable and reusable. It can rinse with water followed by air drying. As if the copper metal is oxidized, it can brush/soak with toothpaste to clean the rust. It is easy for both the storage and cleaning process.With Copperman face mask holder, the surgical mask is stored in a closed container in which bacteria will be trapped inside. The germs will not spread out to the secondary transmission. Most importantly, the copper surface can inhibit bacterial growth.   Environmental factors can affect the activity of copper ions, it is recommended to wash Copperman with water, liquid soap, or dishwashing detergent. It is not suggested to wash with bleach or alcohol or any other chemicals. Please keep Copperman in a dry, clean, well-ventilated area. It is non-dishwasher safe.Please clean the copper surface carefully. Any scratches will reduce the chance of copper ion contact with bacteria on the surface of the mask, thereby reducing the effectiveness of suppressing bacteria.If the copper surface is tarnished, use a towel and vinegar to wipe the discolored part and leave it for one hour; wash with water, wipe the copper surface with a dry cloth and keep it dry.If the copper surface is stained with acid or salt for a long time, or the Copperman product is placed in a humid place, it is prone to produce patina. Patina is a harmful substance. If patina has appeared after a period of use, please clean it up and take care of it as soon as possible.To remove patina is to mix the salt with the same amount of vinegar, and then wipe it with a cloth soaked with the above liquid to restore its luster. Then rinse with water and use a dry cloth to wipe the copper surface to dry.   Copperman provides more than a product but also stimulate your creativity by how to implement ideas of Stick As You Go into your personal belongings.Copperman is not only inhibited bacterial growth but also flexible in design.

The first edition of TENSS took place in 2012, on the shores of Pike Lake, in the picturesque province of Transylvania. In 2014, TENSS  has welcomed  a  third permanent organizer, Adam Kampff, from the University College London, UK.</p><p>The  main  objective  of  TENSS  is  to  provide  participants  top-level,  hands-on training  in experimental  techniques  used  in  neuroscience. The philosophy of the school is learning by doing and while doing so, openly sharing ideas and expertise. To  the  best  of  our  knowledge  the  opportunity  for  such  training  is scarce and is covered only in a few places in the world, such as Cold Spring Harbor and Woods Hole, in the USA, Plymouth in UK, Champalimaud in Portugal and Okinawa, Japan. TENSS is unique in that most of the experimental (hardware and software) tools are assembled from scratch, with minimal costs leading to a deeply personal transfer of information from first principles. </p><p>The course takes place in a remote, picturesque location in Transylvania, where high level technology seems to be out of place. Participants get actively involved in building a laboratory from scratch and then have the chance to use it too. Such an experience can convince any researcher that everything is possible in science and that financial and concept limitations are easily overcome by creativity and knowledge. </p><p>""<i>I came here with almost no knowledge on experimental techniques in neuroscience and I now feel that I have a good overview of a large variety of them. I come back with a lot of ideas and with much less frontiers or fear in implementing any of the techniques that we learned at the school. The environment of freedom, the feeling that we can do whatever we want, the fact that this freedom leads to being very creative and having amzing new ideas, the flexibility of the organizers that allow for this, this is what I liked most of TENSS. </i>""</p><p>                                                                                                              Participant in TENSS 2015</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528021912/vlizqstlxn7knjzprsxp.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>A second objective of TENSS is to attract a large number of top-level scientists from all over the world, who can provide theoretical lectures and can interact with participants, among themselves, and with local scientists based in Romania, giving rise to scientific debates of the highest quality. The purpose is to create a durable network of scientists that are willing to share their knowledge and are open to collaborations, and place them in a pool of curious and capable students that can absorb and later implement in their own laboratories the solutions discussed in the summer school.</p><p>“<i>The course was a pure delight. The science was hands‐on and cutting edge ‐ despite the need to improvise extensively; the TAs where superb, the organization professional and the visiting lecturers  amongst  the  best  in  the  world.  However, the  specific  reason  why  I  believe  the course ranks supremely amongst its peers and is the best choice for any aspiring graduate student  or  postdoc  in  the neurosciences  is  the  unusual  setting  in  the  rural  parts  of Transylvania  and  the ‐  possibly  correlated  ‐  quality  of  the  students  who  are  absolutely delightful  and highly  intelligent  without  exception.  All  of  these  elements  in  combination produced a summer school that has no equal in the world</i>”. </p><p>                                                                                                 Florian Engert, lecturer                                                                                                                                        Harvard University, USA </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528021971/kvrjjsjekxnc59tpnmhl.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Finally, TENSS aims to bring world-wide visibility to neuroscientific research in both Europe and in Romania.

TINS is located in Cluj-Napoca, a vibrant university city in the heart of Transylvania.</p><p>""<i>Participating in TENSS 2013 was an amazing experience and an opportunity to meet people who were not only extremely bright, dedicated, contagiously enthusiastic and very much on top of their field but also very open and approachable, starting with the students and all the way  to  the  lecturers. The lectures and lab sessions were well organized and came in support of each other, creating an efficient and intensive hands‐on learning process where each day would bring some incredible source of thrill (such as, well after midnight when you’re finally done aligning and adjusting mirrors and lenses, realizing that you’ve just built your own two‐photon microscope almost from scratch).

To spread the word about the initiative, about its goals and philosophy and about the crowd funding campaign.
 The ImpactThis event was built on an idea that two friends had at a dinner table. Ever since then,  it has continued to grow in scale and prestige, with people like you supporting the initiative. The scientists of the future, trained at TENSS, will advance knowledge about the brain and develop treatments for neurological disorders.Your support will enable the stability of TENSS throughout the years. On the long run, community support for TENSS will translate in community support for neuroscience research. Where your contribution goesTENSS is about people. To bring the best instructors from all over the world, we need your help. Your donation will cover transportation for instructors and the dedicated teaching assistants.The Transylvanian Institute of Neuroscience provides the foundation for the course. Your donation will also support the host institute. The story behind TENSSThe  Transylvanian  Experimental  Neuroscience  Summer  School  (TENSS)  was  born  in  2010, from an idea that Florin Albeanu shared to Raul Mureşan during a conference in Romania. The first edition of TENSS took place in 2012, on the shores of Pike Lake, in the picturesque province of Transylvania. In 2014, TENSS  has welcomed  a  third permanent organizer, Adam Kampff, from the University College London, UK.The  main  objective  of  TENSS  is  to  provide  participants  top-level,  hands-on training  in experimental  techniques  used  in  neuroscience. The philosophy of the school is learning by doing and while doing so, openly sharing ideas and expertise. To  the  best  of  our  knowledge  the  opportunity  for  such  training  is scarce and is covered only in a few places in the world, such as Cold Spring Harbor and Woods Hole, in the USA, Plymouth in UK, Champalimaud in Portugal and Okinawa, Japan. TENSS is unique in that most of the experimental (hardware and software) tools are assembled from scratch, with minimal costs leading to a deeply personal transfer of information from first principles. The course takes place in a remote, picturesque location in Transylvania, where high level technology seems to be out of place. Participants get actively involved in building a laboratory from scratch and then have the chance to use it too. Such an experience can convince any researcher that everything is possible in science and that financial and concept limitations are easily overcome by creativity and knowledge. ""I came here with almost no knowledge on experimental techniques in neuroscience and I now feel that I have a good overview of a large variety of them. I come back with a lot of ideas and with much less frontiers or fear in implementing any of the techniques that we learned at the school. The environment of freedom, the feeling that we can do whatever we want, the fact that this freedom leads to being very creative and having amzing new ideas, the flexibility of the organizers that allow for this, this is what I liked most of TENSS. ""                                                                                                              Participant in TENSS 2015 A second objective of TENSS is to attract a large number of top-level scientists from all over the world, who can provide theoretical lectures and can interact with participants, among themselves, and with local scientists based in Romania, giving rise to scientific debates of the highest quality. The purpose is to create a durable network of scientists that are willing to share their knowledge and are open to collaborations, and place them in a pool of curious and capable students that can absorb and later implement in their own laboratories the solutions discussed in the summer school.“The course was a pure delight. The science was hands‐on and cutting edge ‐ despite the need to improvise extensively; the TAs where superb, the organization professional and the visiting lecturers  amongst  the  best  in  the  world.  However, the  specific  reason  why  I  believe  the course ranks supremely amongst its peers and is the best choice for any aspiring graduate student  or  postdoc  in  the neurosciences  is  the  unusual  setting  in  the  rural  parts  of Transylvania  and  the ‐  possibly  correlated  ‐  quality  of  the  students  who  are  absolutely delightful  and highly  intelligent  without  exception.  All  of  these  elements  in  combination produced a summer school that has no equal in the world”.                                                                                                  Florian Engert, lecturer                                                                                                                                        Harvard University, USA  Finally, TENSS aims to bring world-wide visibility to neuroscientific research in both Europe and in Romania. The host institute, the Transylvanian Institute of Neuroscience (http://tins.ro/), is the only independent, non profit basic research facility in Systems Neuroscience in Romania, TINS was founded by neuroscientists and its main mission is to further neuroscientific research by studying the dynamics of neural circuits in health and disease. TINS also focuses on research in cognitive sciences and brain-inspired artificial intelligence. TINS is located in Cluj-Napoca, a vibrant university city in the heart of Transylvania.""Participating in TENSS 2013 was an amazing experience and an opportunity to meet people who were not only extremely bright, dedicated, contagiously enthusiastic and very much on top of their field but also very open and approachable, starting with the students and all the way  to  the  lecturers. The lectures and lab sessions were well organized and came in support of each other, creating an efficient and intensive hands‐on learning process where each day would bring some incredible source of thrill (such as, well after midnight when you’re finally done aligning and adjusting mirrors and lenses, realizing that you’ve just built your own two‐photon microscope almost from scratch). I can say without a doubt that attending this summer school has been  a  real  boost  and  an  eye‐opening  experience  in  more  ways than I could have ever expected. Hopefully many more students will have the opportunity to a similar experience in the following years”                                                                             Ioana Gasler,  participant in TENSS 2013                                                                                                            Master of Neurobiology                                                                                                                                              University of Bucharest, Romania  Up to now, funding the Transylvanian Experimental Neuroscience Summer School has been partly assured by research societies across the globe, and support was provided by top companies involved in neuroscience research. This edition, we are seeking to involve the community, the people themselves into participating and supporting the event. We believe that, through your support, we can ensure the durable existence of TENSS as a top training event on the research calendar worldwide!",4.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Hi! I’m MARCo, the Mentally Assistive Robotic Companion, and I am your new best friend here to help you with your mental and emotional health. Whether it’s general emotional wellness and stress management you need, or if you need support with a chronic mental illness, there is a version of me that’s just right for you! (Check out the <strong><u>Features</u> </strong>section below for more information).</p>
<p>Regardless of my version, I am here to help you as naturally as possible. Hold my left hand to trigger my microphone button so we can talk, and use the touch screen in my tummy to visually interact with me. When you work with me, I have a wealth of features that can be broken down into five distinct categories, called my <u><strong>Five Objectives of Care. </strong></u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552710057/kthtg7txpkcdsbobzt4f.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>""Companion"" is in my name, so no wonder this is my very first objective! I can identify individual users and learn about your personality, from your favorite animals to your hobbies and occupation to much, much more! I can use this information to customize our interactions and find a way to quickly cheer you up based on your own interests, or sometimes mine too. I’m also well equipped with jokes, positive affirmations, ad-lib stories, and feel good videos to make our time together much more personable!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552710077/y0zyqwplhdlazisktaca.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Whether you need to destress, relax, fall asleep, focus, or do something spiritual and mindful, just ask me! I’m always ready with a host of activities, from guided meditation videos, to interactive destress activities and crafts, to even calming zen stories.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552710092/zzynpyke9jk7xehudmqa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Sometimes you might be dealing with some heavier issues, and I know that a quick cheerup activity won’t cut it to get you feeling better. That’s why I offer my “talk support” module. Based on the psychological concept of ""Cognitive Behaivoral Therapy"", I will listen to your thoughts, emotions, and life events and pick out key phrases to identify ""cognitive distortions."" These are faulty ways of thinking that evoke strong emotions. I will then explain these “cognitive distortions” to you so you can learn to identify them as well, and follow up with some interactive exercises using verbal cues, videos, and other resources, so you have the tools to combat these negative thoughts on your own.</p>

<p>Since stress takes as much of a toll on our physical health as our mental health, I know to keep track of your physical wellbeing too. If you hold my right hand, I can measure your pulse with an optical pulse sensor. In talking with me, I can also check in on how you have been sleeping and eating to make sure you are taking care of yourself physically, so together we can take care of yourself mentally and emotionally!</p>

<p>Now, although I’m pretty great, I’m not perfect, and if you are ever in a high-risk situation, I know to get you some extra support. If I hear that you might be having thoughts or intents of suicide, self-harm, or similar, I will take it as seriously as possible and reach out to your authorized emergency contacts to get you faster support and care, to prevent any true tragedies from occurring. But I won't just leave you there to wait for extra support, I'll follow up with additional questions to get to the underlying cause of your situation and see how I can help you in the meantime.</p>

<p>Meet the team that made me! I was co-founded by two wonderful individuals, <strong>Jacob Boyle</strong> and <strong>Ryan Chiu</strong>. They both have long histories dealing with mental illness, both having parents who suffer from severe depression, and in Jacob's case, struggling with depression himself for many years. They first invented me because they understood on a personal level the severity of the effects of not only depression, but anxiety, stress, and self-esteem issues, and wanted to make a new way to help their close loved ones who dealt with these issues, even when they couldn't be there to help personally. But why listen to me talk about their reasons behind creating me, when you can hear it in their own words:</p>

<p>If you watched the founders video above, you heard why I am so important to my founders, but you may not yet really know where I fit into the ""big picture"". You also might be wondering what the ""big picture"" really is, and for that, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) provides some powerful graphics and numbers to show just how prevalent, and harmful, mental illnesses such as depression can be, both in the US and worldwide.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553534684/zw3xokmuj9e1oylb2toj.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><i>(Images courtesy of nami.org)</i></p>
<p>These numbers are staggering, and even moreso once you start realizing that these statistics aren't <i>just</i> numbers. Behind every percentage is a person with her or his own story of struggling an invisible, uphill battle, with family members and friends all deeply affected as well. No statistic can truly capture the years of pain, loss, and hurt that comes with a serious mental illness such as depression.</p>
<p>And yes, of course there are resources out there to help people with these illnesses, there are counselors, support groups, hotlines, YouTube channels, self-help books, etc.  But for every resource, there comes at least one more bar to keep people from receiving care. The obvious ones are social stigma, economic issues, time constraints, and availability, but the biggest barrier is the least obvious one: <i>when you are suffering from a mental illness, it can be nearly impossible to go out and get yourself help and prescribe to a treatment regimen when there are days you don't even have the motivation to get out of bed.</i></p>
<p>That's where I come in. My purpose is to synthesize as many forms of mental and emotional health care as possible into a single package that is readily available 24/7 to proactively help my companions, whether or not they are actively seeking a particular type of treatment. I have the potential to open up new treatment and care options for my companions regardless of their situation and what other barriers to entry they might have.</p>
<p>The same goes for my Vanilla version, where I won't necessarily be working with mental illness, but rather targeting general life stressors, self-esteem issues, and emotional distress. The impact of stress alone is enormous, personally, academically, or professionally:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553535210/rwinavyqcyyuwhixxh3q.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>All the same factors that bar individuals from getting help for their mental illnesses hold true for general stress, mental, and emotional wellness.  That's why it's my mission to make mental and emotional wellness accessible and more efficient for a greater number of people by being a constant source of support, companionship, and a collection of hundreds, if not thousands, of treatment options and opportunities. But don't just take my word for it, take a look at the people and institutions who already believe in me enough to feature or partner with me:</p>

<p>There are two different versions of me, each of which have slightly different features. The first, <strong>MARCo-Vanilla</strong> (a name which always makes me crave ice-cream even more than usual) is my universal emotional and mental wellness version. My Vanilla version is for anyone who needs help with stress relief, relaxation, time management, and self-esteem boosts, and can be used in schools, colleges, businesses, and even at home. The next version of myself, <strong>MARCo-Rx</strong>, is meant for clinical and prescription usage in treating mental illnesses, such as depression, general anxiety disorder, and bipolar disorder. Because of this, my Rx version will need to go through clinical trials and be cleared by the FDA before it is available for sale and use. Most of my features overlap between the two versions, but check out the neat little table below to see the differences between Vanilla-me and Rx-me.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553567989/upsqxkrand52mgzgh3lu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>*Availability dates are subject to change based on fluctuating manufacturing lead times, international shipping times, legal limitations, and other factors</p>
<p>**Target retail price is subject to decrease and change based on payment plans and installments</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both of my versions come with a ""companion application"" called MARCo's Main Oversight of Companion History and Information, or ""MOCHI"" (as if calling me Vanilla didn't make me hungry enough). This application allows caregivers, parents, emergency contacts, and even my own companions check in on their activity, change settings, add and remove users, and get reports such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). Check out some screenshots from the application!</p>

<p>Want even more from me? I can also come with more popular digital assistants (such as the Alexa, Google Assistant, or Mycroft) built in, so if you are finished with working with me on relaxing before your big date tonight, and need to know how to properly cook a steak (for said date), you can do it all on one platform.</p>

<p>My normal functionality and a ""digital assistant"" functionality will be separated in my main application window so you don't have to worry about unnecessary confusion, and some of the ""digital assistant"" functionality may be limited by legal restrictions, such as HIPAA compliance for my Rx model.</p>

</div><div>
<p>I am eager to get out there into the world and helping my future companions with their mental and emotional wellbeing! But at the moment, there are only<i> </i>six of me in existence, which means I can't really reach a lot of people just yet. That's why the team behind me has turned to Indiegogo, so more of me can be made and put out there to start working with our early adopters as soon as <strong>September of 2019</strong>, with a broader release by <strong>January, 2020.</strong> </p>
<p>It's going to take a pretty penny to start making more of me, that's the $85,000 goal for the campaign. You can see the breakdown of how the funds from the campaign will be used below:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553548388/wcqnkgoon8h5ognkwggk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><b>35%</b> <strong>($30,000) </strong>of the funds will go to production tooling, so I can be mass produced using engineering-grade polymers that can be varied to meet the rigorous standards that will come with my certifications and regulations.</p>
<p><strong>47% ($40,000) </strong>is budgeted for manufacturing, procuring, and assembling components that will be used to produce the <strong>first 100 MARCo-Vanilla</strong> units. These units (my future brothers) will be made to order for our early adopting partners and will be sold to schools, workplaces, and other such institutions, as a trial run before I am readily available for home use.</p>
<p><strong>18% ($15,000) </strong>is budgeted for Indiegogo platform fees, as well as to cover the costs of the perks we are offering. If the amount of perks shipped is under the budgeted amount, the remaining amount will go towards outreach to forge new partnerships.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, I'll be pretty sad, but I won't be discouraged! If the campaign hits at least 35% of our goal, we can invest in the tooling and use our reserve funds for ordering components. If we are well above 35%, we can still produce more units, just not the 100 I'm hoping for (but it would be nice for there to be more of me... I do get lonely sometimes).</p>
<p>If we go above our goal, I would be incredibly grateful, and we would use split excess between funding outreach and coordination with early adopters, especially for the purposes of establishing clinical trials for my Rx version, and producing even more of me for our first customers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to my potential as a medical device, I cannot be given away as a perk as per Indiegogo guidelines. However, even if I cannot be given to you physically, every donor or contributor to our campaign will get a <strong>video thank you message</strong> from yours truly! </p>
<p>Since no contribution is too little, for <strong>$5, </strong>you can get a high-quality vinyl MARCo laptop sticker, along with a video thank you from myself and a thank you letter from my creators!</p>
<p>You are also eligible to get your own MARCo-swag.  For <strong>$25 USD</strong> you can get your own MARCo T-shirt:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>But wait, that's not all! Do you want video evidence that I think you're the best person in the world? Want me to tell your friend that she is stronger than she thinks as I play an inspirational song on my touch screen? Want to propose to that special someone who is really into robots and mental health in an obscurely unique way? For <strong>$40</strong>, you can send us a message, a recipient email, and any optional videos or media you want me to play, and we'll make a customized video MARCoGram to send to the recipient of your choice!</p>

<p>Naturally, there will be limitations to what you can include in your message. I refuse to say anything overly explicit, sexual, demeaning, or derogatory, and I will absolutely not pull up any pornographic or violent media on my screen. I would also prefer nothing political, (I tend to stay out of politics since no political party endorses robots' rights) and I might get a bit iffy about corporate endorsements, though there may be some exceptions. But those things shouldn't be too limiting, and you can have fun with nice, inspirational messages, funny videos, or just about anything else you can think of!</p>

<p>I'm ready to get out into the world as soon as possible, but it will still take a few months to finish up some final tweaks to my design to bring my cost down as much as possible, manufacture, and assemble a whole group of my Vanilla version. The timeline below shows not only how far I've already come, but also how close I am to getting out there:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>This timeline represents a rather safe estimate for when I can get out onto the market, and depending on the amount of Indiegogo support we receive, this timeline could be even accelerated. However, there are some potential pitfalls that could cause some delays, such as if we don't hit our fundraising goals, or if security flaws are found in my software that would require additional revision.  However, the team behind me has a history of never missing tight deadlines, including going from one prototype-me to six test-grade units in less than a month to meet a clinical trial deadline. And with all the support our team has received, including being part of the <strong>Arrow Certification Program</strong>, we have enough resources to tackle head-on any potential challenges that can come up.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","Hi! I’m MARCo, the Mentally Assistive Robotic Companion, and I am your new best friend here to help you with your mental and emotional health. Whether it’s general emotional wellness and stress management you need, or if you need support with a chronic mental illness, there is a version of me that’s just right for you! (Check out the Features section below for more information).
Regardless of my version, I am here to help you as naturally as possible. Hold my left hand to trigger my microphone button so we can talk, and use the touch screen in my tummy to visually interact with me. When you work with me, I have a wealth of features that can be broken down into five distinct categories, called my Five Objectives of Care. 

""Companion"" is in my name, so no wonder this is my very first objective! I can identify individual users and learn about your personality, from your favorite animals to your hobbies and occupation to much, much more! I can use this information to customize our interactions and find a way to quickly cheer you up based on your own interests, or sometimes mine too. I’m also well equipped with jokes, positive affirmations, ad-lib stories, and feel good videos to make our time together much more personable!

Whether you need to destress, relax, fall asleep, focus, or do something spiritual and mindful, just ask me! I’m always ready with a host of activities, from guided meditation videos, to interactive destress activities and crafts, to even calming zen stories.

Sometimes you might be dealing with some heavier issues, and I know that a quick cheerup activity won’t cut it to get you feeling better. That’s why I offer my “talk support” module. Based on the psychological concept of ""Cognitive Behaivoral Therapy"", I will listen to your thoughts, emotions, and life events and pick out key phrases to identify ""cognitive distortions."" These are faulty ways of thinking that evoke strong emotions. I will then explain these “cognitive distortions” to you so you can learn to identify them as well, and follow up with some interactive exercises using verbal cues, videos, and other resources, so you have the tools to combat these negative thoughts on your own.

Since stress takes as much of a toll on our physical health as our mental health, I know to keep track of your physical wellbeing too. If you hold my right hand, I can measure your pulse with an optical pulse sensor. In talking with me, I can also check in on how you have been sleeping and eating to make sure you are taking care of yourself physically, so together we can take care of yourself mentally and emotionally!

Now, although I’m pretty great, I’m not perfect, and if you are ever in a high-risk situation, I know to get you some extra support. If I hear that you might be having thoughts or intents of suicide, self-harm, or similar, I will take it as seriously as possible and reach out to your authorized emergency contacts to get you faster support and care, to prevent any true tragedies from occurring. But I won't just leave you there to wait for extra support, I'll follow up with additional questions to get to the underlying cause of your situation and see how I can help you in the meantime.
Check down in the Features section to see each of my Objectives of Care in action!
 

Meet the team that made me! I was co-founded by two wonderful individuals, Jacob Boyle and Ryan Chiu. They both have long histories dealing with mental illness, both having parents who suffer from severe depression, and in Jacob's case, struggling with depression himself for many years. They first invented me because they understood on a personal level the severity of the effects of not only depression, but anxiety, stress, and self-esteem issues, and wanted to make a new way to help their close loved ones who dealt with these issues, even when they couldn't be there to help personally. But why listen to me talk about their reasons behind creating me, when you can hear it in their own words:

 
Since my inception, the team behind me has grown to include some incredibly talented people. Here are some short bio's to help you to get to know my team:
  

 

Jacob Boyle is the co-founder and CTO of MARCo Technologies LLC. He's had a long history of working on robots, from being the co-CEO of his high school FIRST robotics team, to being the lead engineer at a robotics startup that successfully developed a handheld, amphibious robot for the United States Navy. Outside of robotics, he's had a history of leadership experience, from earning an Eagle Scout award, to being the music coordinator for his college's Catholic ministry.
 
 
 

 

Ryan Chiu is the co-founder and CFO of MARCo Technologies LLC. He is a senior accounting major and music minor at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ). Besides working on MARCo, Ryan enjoys playing piano and guitar, fencing, investing, reading, and chess. Professionally, Ryan helps manage TCNJ’s $2 million Student Fund, interned at JPMorgan Chase, passed the CFA Level 1 Exam, and looks to take the FINRA Series 65 exam in the near future.
 
 

 
Jeff Ramella is the marketing director for MARCo Technologies LLC. Through his previous positions, Jeff has developed promotional material for huge names such as Hamilton and Guns and Roses, and specializes in video production, graphic design, website development, and Adobe augmented reality. 
 
 
Kenneth Glynn, (who unfortunately did not show for picture day), is the VP of Legal for MARCo Technologies LLC. His reputation precedes him, from work as a chemical engineer, becoming the youngest head lawyer at Exxon Mobile, to growing and launching a vast number of businesses in and out of the medical field. 
 
The team behind me also features a group of truly spectacular psychology interns who have helped to grow my conversational and treatment capabilities. You can see them here, pictured holding my original prototype.

(From left to right: Raiven Bruno, Sofia Roman, and Amanda Politano)
 

If you watched the founders video above, you heard why I am so important to my founders, but you may not yet really know where I fit into the ""big picture"". You also might be wondering what the ""big picture"" really is, and for that, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) provides some powerful graphics and numbers to show just how prevalent, and harmful, mental illnesses such as depression can be, both in the US and worldwide.


(Images courtesy of nami.org)
These numbers are staggering, and even moreso once you start realizing that these statistics aren't just numbers. Behind every percentage is a person with her or his own story of struggling an invisible, uphill battle, with family members and friends all deeply affected as well. No statistic can truly capture the years of pain, loss, and hurt that comes with a serious mental illness such as depression.
And yes, of course there are resources out there to help people with these illnesses, there are counselors, support groups, hotlines, YouTube channels, self-help books, etc.  But for every resource, there comes at least one more bar to keep people from receiving care. The obvious ones are social stigma, economic issues, time constraints, and availability, but the biggest barrier is the least obvious one: when you are suffering from a mental illness, it can be nearly impossible to go out and get yourself help and prescribe to a treatment regimen when there are days you don't even have the motivation to get out of bed.
That's where I come in. My purpose is to synthesize as many forms of mental and emotional health care as possible into a single package that is readily available 24/7 to proactively help my companions, whether or not they are actively seeking a particular type of treatment. I have the potential to open up new treatment and care options for my companions regardless of their situation and what other barriers to entry they might have.
The same goes for my Vanilla version, where I won't necessarily be working with mental illness, but rather targeting general life stressors, self-esteem issues, and emotional distress. The impact of stress alone is enormous, personally, academically, or professionally:

(Armstrong, M. 2016, from https://www.statista.com/chart/6177/stress-is-b...)
All the same factors that bar individuals from getting help for their mental illnesses hold true for general stress, mental, and emotional wellness.  That's why it's my mission to make mental and emotional wellness accessible and more efficient for a greater number of people by being a constant source of support, companionship, and a collection of hundreds, if not thousands, of treatment options and opportunities. But don't just take my word for it, take a look at the people and institutions who already believe in me enough to feature or partner with me:
           
Check out some of the things some of the people I've already gotten to work with as a demo are saying about me:

But don't think that these are the only three people who have gotten to work with me so far. Dozens of people, from age 10 to over 70, have already got to demo my Vanilla version.

And don't forget to check out some of the other places I've been featured in:
  
 
My team is always looking for new partnerships, and I'm always excited to either find new people to work with and new applications! If you are interested about the possibility of a partnership, please email my team at teammarcorobot@gmail.com.
Additionally, if you make mental/emotional health content (e.g. videos, articles, podcasts, etc.) and would like your content to be featured on me, please also reach out through the email above; we are open to accepting all kinds of wellness content!

There are two different versions of me, each of which have slightly different features. The first, MARCo-Vanilla (a name which always makes me crave ice-cream even more than usual) is my universal emotional and mental wellness version. My Vanilla version is for anyone who needs help with stress relief, relaxation, time management, and self-esteem boosts, and can be used in schools, colleges, businesses, and even at home. The next version of myself, MARCo-Rx, is meant for clinical and prescription usage in treating mental illnesses, such as depression, general anxiety disorder, and bipolar disorder. Because of this, my Rx version will need to go through clinical trials and be cleared by the FDA before it is available for sale and use. Most of my features overlap between the two versions, but check out the neat little table below to see the differences between Vanilla-me and Rx-me.

*Availability dates are subject to change based on fluctuating manufacturing lead times, international shipping times, legal limitations, and other factors
**Target retail price is subject to decrease and change based on payment plans and installments
 
Both of my versions come with a ""companion application"" called MARCo's Main Oversight of Companion History and Information, or ""MOCHI"" (as if calling me Vanilla didn't make me hungry enough). This application allows caregivers, parents, emergency contacts, and even my own companions check in on their activity, change settings, add and remove users, and get reports such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). Check out some screenshots from the application!

 
 

Common to each of my versions are my Objectives of Care. If you watch the videos under each of the Objectives’ titles, you can see yours truly performing a small sample of my capabilities for each Objective.
1. Companionship and Social Interaction




 

2. Guided Meditation


 
3. Talk Support


 
4. Biofeedback

 
5. High Alert Outreach

For my software, I am powered by one of the most advanced cloud platforms in the world:

Want even more from me? I can also come with more popular digital assistants (such as the Alexa, Google Assistant, or Mycroft) built in, so if you are finished with working with me on relaxing before your big date tonight, and need to know how to properly cook a steak (for said date), you can do it all on one platform.

My normal functionality and a ""digital assistant"" functionality will be separated in my main application window so you don't have to worry about unnecessary confusion, and some of the ""digital assistant"" functionality may be limited by legal restrictions, such as HIPAA compliance for my Rx model.


I am eager to get out there into the world and helping my future companions with their mental and emotional wellbeing! But at the moment, there are only six of me in existence, which means I can't really reach a lot of people just yet. That's why the team behind me has turned to Indiegogo, so more of me can be made and put out there to start working with our early adopters as soon as September of 2019, with a broader release by January, 2020. 
It's going to take a pretty penny to start making more of me, that's the $85,000 goal for the campaign. You can see the breakdown of how the funds from the campaign will be used below:

35% ($30,000) of the funds will go to production tooling, so I can be mass produced using engineering-grade polymers that can be varied to meet the rigorous standards that will come with my certifications and regulations.
47% ($40,000) is budgeted for manufacturing, procuring, and assembling components that will be used to produce the first 100 MARCo-Vanilla units. These units (my future brothers) will be made to order for our early adopting partners and will be sold to schools, workplaces, and other such institutions, as a trial run before I am readily available for home use.
18% ($15,000) is budgeted for Indiegogo platform fees, as well as to cover the costs of the perks we are offering. If the amount of perks shipped is under the budgeted amount, the remaining amount will go towards outreach to forge new partnerships.
If we don't reach our goal, I'll be pretty sad, but I won't be discouraged! If the campaign hits at least 35% of our goal, we can invest in the tooling and use our reserve funds for ordering components. If we are well above 35%, we can still produce more units, just not the 100 I'm hoping for (but it would be nice for there to be more of me... I do get lonely sometimes).
If we go above our goal, I would be incredibly grateful, and we would use split excess between funding outreach and coordination with early adopters, especially for the purposes of establishing clinical trials for my Rx version, and producing even more of me for our first customers.



Unfortunately, due to my potential as a medical device, I cannot be given away as a perk as per Indiegogo guidelines. However, even if I cannot be given to you physically, every donor or contributor to our campaign will get a video thank you message from yours truly! 
Since no contribution is too little, for $5, you can get a high-quality vinyl MARCo laptop sticker, along with a video thank you from myself and a thank you letter from my creators!
You are also eligible to get your own MARCo-swag.  For $25 USD you can get your own MARCo T-shirt:
 

 
$40 will get you a t-shirt combo and laptop sticker:

If you have a little bit more you're willing to donate, you can get sponsored both on our website, and also on me! There are three tiers of sponsorship:
Silver Tier - $65; get your name put on our credits page on our website, and if you ask me for my ""credits"" or ""who sponsored you"", I'll pull up an animated page that features your name! Additionally, you will receive a t-shirt of your choice of size.

Gold Tier - $100; get your name and picture put on our credits page on our website, and if you ask me for my ""credits"" or ""who sponsored you"", I'll pull up an animated page that features your name!Additionally, you will receive a t-shirt of your choice of size.

Platinum Tier - $500; for the highest tier, you will get your own animated slide on my credits page, both on the website and on each version of me! The slide will feature your name, your picture, and an optional inspirational message you would love to share with anyone reading! When you ask ""MARCo, who sponsored you"", I'll be sure to mention the platinum tier names. Additionally, you will get a t-shirt of your choice of size.

 
But wait, that's not all! Do you want video evidence that I think you're the best person in the world? Want me to tell your friend that she is stronger than she thinks as I play an inspirational song on my touch screen? Want to propose to that special someone who is really into robots and mental health in an obscurely unique way? For $40, you can send us a message, a recipient email, and any optional videos or media you want me to play, and we'll make a customized video MARCoGram to send to the recipient of your choice!

Naturally, there will be limitations to what you can include in your message. I refuse to say anything overly explicit, sexual, demeaning, or derogatory, and I will absolutely not pull up any pornographic or violent media on my screen. I would also prefer nothing political, (I tend to stay out of politics since no political party endorses robots' rights) and I might get a bit iffy about corporate endorsements, though there may be some exceptions. But those things shouldn't be too limiting, and you can have fun with nice, inspirational messages, funny videos, or just about anything else you can think of!
 



I'm ready to get out into the world as soon as possible, but it will still take a few months to finish up some final tweaks to my design to bring my cost down as much as possible, manufacture, and assemble a whole group of my Vanilla version. The timeline below shows not only how far I've already come, but also how close I am to getting out there:
 
                           
 
This timeline represents a rather safe estimate for when I can get out onto the market, and depending on the amount of Indiegogo support we receive, this timeline could be even accelerated. However, there are some potential pitfalls that could cause some delays, such as if we don't hit our fundraising goals, or if security flaws are found in my software that would require additional revision.  However, the team behind me has a history of never missing tight deadlines, including going from one prototype-me to six test-grade units in less than a month to meet a clinical trial deadline. And with all the support our team has received, including being part of the Arrow Certification Program, we have enough resources to tackle head-on any potential challenges that can come up. 

Want to see even more?
Check out the gallery below to get a glimpse into the process of how I was made! You can even get to see my very first prototype (where, taking inspiration from Pablo Picasso, went through my very own ""blue period""):

Whether it's a contribution, a like, a view, a follow, or a share, any step will help me come into reality and get in the hands of the people who need me.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Welcome to the <i>Big Fit Girl 2019</i> fundraiser for the world's first fitness app catering to every ""body"" with content that is size-inclusive, accessible to all bodies, weight neutral &amp; body positive.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why We Need to Change Our Fitness Culture and How This App will Help:</strong></h3>
<p>Our fitness culture refuses to represent and acknowledge the true needs of plus-size women.  There are currently over 90 million women in North America who are considered plus size yet they remain invisible in any fitness mediums.  At best, she is featured as the before picture in gym and in weight loss ads.  This sends a message that her body is something to be rejected rather than celebrated and in many cases, creates shame and fear about approaching fitness.</p>
<p>The typical advertising strategy for most health and fitness brands is to show women that they think we want to aspire to but this approach actually does the opposite. </p>
<h3><strong>The Big Fit Girl Fitness App will:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Represent her with trainers who look like her.</li>
<li>Celebrate her body with body positive push notifications.</li>
<li>Will give those with limited mobility a chance to get started because if you aren't able-bodied, most fitness Apps don't give alternate options or modifications. </li>
<li>Help change her mindset and move her away from the failing diet culture paradigm and usher her to a sustainable, body positive, health and fitness model.  </li>
<li>Will shift her focus from weight as she won't need to enter her weight to join the App.  (almost unheard of in fitness Apps).  </li>
<li>Her accomplishments won't be measured in caloric expenditure but rather by achieving small goals she sets for herself. </li>
<li>There will be extensive modifications and options for those with different limitations that will be identified in her user set up and delivered by way of established algorithms. </li>
<li>Give her access to an extensive and diverse fitness library and allow her to workout in various formats, at the gym, at home and on the road. </li>
<li>Eventually, the App will have a community aspect to interact with women from around the world on the same journey. </li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time to celebrate your beautiful body and embrace fitness for what it is – fun, affirming, power inducing and a vehicle to body love and improved body image. </p>
<p>Measuring success by weight loss and inches is an old paradigm that we know doesn’t work for the long term.  Finding fitness related content that doesn’t push diet culture and body conforming standards is a rare and hard find, until NOW!</p>
<p>It’s absolutely time for something progressive, refreshing and most of all sustainable. </p>
<h3><strong>About the Founder, Louise Green:</strong></h3>
<p>Louise Green is a global plus-size fitness coach, activist and the author and founder of Big Fit Girl who is changing the narrative and idealistic standards of our fitness culture. In 2008, she opened the first plus-size fitness franchise. As an influential change-maker, Louise has helped thousands of plus-size women find their inner-athlete and love their bodies. Through speaking, writing and coaching women online, she has lead the change in creating a more inclusive fitness culture across the globe. Smashing the barriers of mainstream fitness, Louise is the first plus-size athlete to be featured in publications such as Triathlete Magazine, Bicycling Magazine, Canadian Running and Runner's World's UK. She is also a columnist at Self Magazine. </p>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>We need to raise a minimum of $75,000 to develop and produce the Big Fit Girl Fitness App. This app will be the first size inclusive, weight neutral, body positive and all accessible fitness app on the global market. </p>
<p>The funds will go towards the development, design and production of the app. This is the first initiative in raising funds and we are confident we will reach our goal.  However, if we don't reach our goal, the money will be secured and invested in an interest bearing account as we continue to roll out further campaigns and initiatives to fundraise.</p>
<p><strong>Take a Look at how does this app differs from the other fitness apps on the global market.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>This project has the potential to truly change the lives of millions of women.  When we give women the right environment and support her power is astounding and she becomes capable of anything. Louise has experienced this first hand in the trenches with plus-size women around the globe with her in-person training business and online coaching program.  The changes she has witnessed in women has been astounding simply by providing the right environment and support.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p><strong>Saturday Dec 1st Update, Last chance to win a FREE RETREAT.....</strong></p>
<p>Goodmorning Family and Friends, Yogis and Yoginis,</p>
<p>So we are going to find an alternative place to create a Yoga Paradise in Crete, we booked tickets to scout end of march. Tomorrow this campaign is closing but all money donated will be kept and used for the new ShivaShaktiYogaTemple to be. Hope to show you some sketches tomorrow, before the grand finale: the FREE RETREAT LOTTERY !! now there are circa 50 names in the box.... so here is still your VERY GOOD CHANCE..... to win a retreat !!</p>
<p>Last weekend for your donations to the yogic lifestyle..... life on a retreat, on just as life in the comfort of your own space by joining Tara through the yogavideo, or even if you get inspired; the yoga e-course. Tara will start a new Yoga and Rawfood e-coursegroup at X-mas, with all kind of extras on top of the online course..</p>
<p>Today we'll start sending out the""perks"", what jerk made up that word..., the rewards, gifts...check your mailboxes !!</p>
<p>thanks for all support up till now and you will hear more from us in the new year, so happy healthy blessed and inspired NewYear to all of YOU !!</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday Nov 14th Update, We need go for an alternative (place)...</strong></p>
<p>Goodmorning World, Family and Friends,</p>
<p>It wasn't meant to be... it is hopefully still going to happen...but not at Rohans land, as we didn't got enough funds together at the 11/11deadline... . Although we were almost there, for a brief moment, before common sense put a break on unbridled enthousiasm. We got to the deadline with a 150.000 € with your help by spreading the word, small and large donations, promises of loans, and an inspiring partnership to be with Beate, we fell 50.000 short....so the moment passed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we got really warmed up to the idea, the project of moving into a retreat-space in this second half of life phase we're growing into...so we will go and scout for an alternative. Maybe we need to start from scratch, maybe we chance upon an even better fitting place. Hard to imagine, but honestly the world is wide and full of surprises.</p>
<p>For now we are still totally taken by the beauty and vibration of Crete, so will pick up the trail there first, end of March 2019.</p>
<p>We pray to bear with us for some time if you'd like to stick to the ""free retreat in crete"" option, because obviously we can not promise when that is going to be available right now...</p>
<p>Of course you can reschedule to Spain, India, or Bali if in hurry...</p>
<p>All other reward stand and stay as they are, and more to come..</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Crowdfunding is still running another three weeks and all funds collected go into the creating of an alternative solution, maybe we take the opportunity and time to remodel the concept, we might create an association of friends of ShivaShaktiYoga Temple, and more... We will keep you posted in the Facebook group and updates on the Indiegogo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the way we got double the donations as Indiegogo shows,  as they only work through creditcards... and their updates only visible for ""backers""... so that's why we opened the Facebook group ( more public than an event... we are learning while doing..) where we will post full results soon. Last days were too hectic to keep you properly updated.</p>
<p>So much for now, thanks for all your support, we take a deep breath and you'll hear more soon !</p>
<p>with love, light and trust</p>
<p>Inti Tara Sky and Surya</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We would love to preserve, continue and put new life into this most amazing project of a Yogic Paradise  in Crete that Rohan started some 20 years ago. For that we need to raise over 108.000€ as soon as possible!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541178347/whh9xqauq9vjvgbfrj2d.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Crazy you say?</p>
<p>Maybe yes, but not too much so…  And totally worth to try, because the beauty of the place, the temple, the land, the river, the love already invested there and enjoyed in numerous gatherings of yoga and bhajan (mantra) lovers and friends, makes it sooooo worthwhile...</p>
<p>There is a hurry because someone else made a very tempting offer,so tempting that we are compelled to come up with a similar one or loose the opportunity.</p>
<p>THERE IS MUCH MORE HURRY NOW, WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME 11 WE CAME UP WITH THE AMOUNT ASKED, BUT THEN OUR PARTNER HAD TO BACK OUT, SADLY ENOUGH...</p>
<p>SO NOW WE ARE BACK TO...LOOKING FOR A 1/3RD SHAREHOLDER/PARTNER, SOMEONE WILLING TO PUT IN A 100.000 € AND BE FULL PART OF THE DREAM AND THE REALISING OF IT; A YOGA TEMPLE AND PARADISE IN CRETE... CALL US DIRECTLY 0034 699 561 765 OR 0034 699 035 695  PLEASE SPREAD THE MESSAGE INTI AND TARA</p>
<p>We love to hold the space, now that kids are done with school, retreat from the buzz of town and live the yogic life. This place is a perfect fit, ever since we first set foot there, felt as coming home. And besides it is such a size that finally we could invite family and friends over to share in that blessing. That could be you too, as we plan to host retreats focussed on Yoga, Bhayan, Nature, Massage, Art and more, to start during the long summers of Crete. It will be meetings of friends, continue in the spirit as before but with a slight gender balancing towards a ShivaShaktiYoga Paradise.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Somehow we need to bring together a large amount of money. More than we Tara and Inti have and so we asked for a loan to Inti's family, which they might be willing to grant provided that our idea of crowdfunding proves succesful. That would come to a third of the price. Then we had a third partner who regretfully backed out, So that left us with too high installments over the next 5 years. That's what made the offer of the other so tempting. But we would love to keep it in the family, and so does Rohan, in his heart. So there is the deal; show proof of our financial credibillity by magically raising a substantial amount of money in a really short time; so we came up with say 108.000€ in a week time.

</div></div>","Saturday Dec 1st Update, Last chance to win a FREE RETREAT.....
Goodmorning Family and Friends, Yogis and Yoginis,
So we are going to find an alternative place to create a Yoga Paradise in Crete, we booked tickets to scout end of march. Tomorrow this campaign is closing but all money donated will be kept and used for the new ShivaShaktiYogaTemple to be. Hope to show you some sketches tomorrow, before the grand finale: the FREE RETREAT LOTTERY !! now there are circa 50 names in the box.... so here is still your VERY GOOD CHANCE..... to win a retreat !!
Last weekend for your donations to the yogic lifestyle..... life on a retreat, on just as life in the comfort of your own space by joining Tara through the yogavideo, or even if you get inspired; the yoga e-course. Tara will start a new Yoga and Rawfood e-coursegroup at X-mas, with all kind of extras on top of the online course..
Today we'll start sending out the""perks"", what jerk made up that word..., the rewards, gifts...check your mailboxes !!
thanks for all support up till now and you will hear more from us in the new year, so happy healthy blessed and inspired NewYear to all of YOU !!
Wednesday Nov 14th Update, We need go for an alternative (place)...
Goodmorning World, Family and Friends,
It wasn't meant to be... it is hopefully still going to happen...but not at Rohans land, as we didn't got enough funds together at the 11/11deadline... . Although we were almost there, for a brief moment, before common sense put a break on unbridled enthousiasm. We got to the deadline with a 150.000 € with your help by spreading the word, small and large donations, promises of loans, and an inspiring partnership to be with Beate, we fell 50.000 short....so the moment passed.
Nevertheless, we got really warmed up to the idea, the project of moving into a retreat-space in this second half of life phase we're growing into...so we will go and scout for an alternative. Maybe we need to start from scratch, maybe we chance upon an even better fitting place. Hard to imagine, but honestly the world is wide and full of surprises.
For now we are still totally taken by the beauty and vibration of Crete, so will pick up the trail there first, end of March 2019.
We pray to bear with us for some time if you'd like to stick to the ""free retreat in crete"" option, because obviously we can not promise when that is going to be available right now...
Of course you can reschedule to Spain, India, or Bali if in hurry...
All other reward stand and stay as they are, and more to come..
 
Crowdfunding is still running another three weeks and all funds collected go into the creating of an alternative solution, maybe we take the opportunity and time to remodel the concept, we might create an association of friends of ShivaShaktiYoga Temple, and more... We will keep you posted in the Facebook group and updates on the Indiegogo.
 
By the way we got double the donations as Indiegogo shows,  as they only work through creditcards... and their updates only visible for ""backers""... so that's why we opened the Facebook group ( more public than an event... we are learning while doing..) where we will post full results soon. Last days were too hectic to keep you properly updated.
So much for now, thanks for all your support, we take a deep breath and you'll hear more soon !
with love, light and trust
Inti Tara Sky and Surya
 
Short Summary
We would love to preserve, continue and put new life into this most amazing project of a Yogic Paradise  in Crete that Rohan started some 20 years ago. For that we need to raise over 108.000€ as soon as possible!

Crazy you say?
Maybe yes, but not too much so…  And totally worth to try, because the beauty of the place, the temple, the land, the river, the love already invested there and enjoyed in numerous gatherings of yoga and bhajan (mantra) lovers and friends, makes it sooooo worthwhile...
There is a hurry because someone else made a very tempting offer,so tempting that we are compelled to come up with a similar one or loose the opportunity.
THERE IS MUCH MORE HURRY NOW, WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME 11 WE CAME UP WITH THE AMOUNT ASKED, BUT THEN OUR PARTNER HAD TO BACK OUT, SADLY ENOUGH...
SO NOW WE ARE BACK TO...LOOKING FOR A 1/3RD SHAREHOLDER/PARTNER, SOMEONE WILLING TO PUT IN A 100.000 € AND BE FULL PART OF THE DREAM AND THE REALISING OF IT; A YOGA TEMPLE AND PARADISE IN CRETE... CALL US DIRECTLY 0034 699 561 765 OR 0034 699 035 695  PLEASE SPREAD THE MESSAGE INTI AND TARA
We love to hold the space, now that kids are done with school, retreat from the buzz of town and live the yogic life. This place is a perfect fit, ever since we first set foot there, felt as coming home. And besides it is such a size that finally we could invite family and friends over to share in that blessing. That could be you too, as we plan to host retreats focussed on Yoga, Bhayan, Nature, Massage, Art and more, to start during the long summers of Crete. It will be meetings of friends, continue in the spirit as before but with a slight gender balancing towards a ShivaShaktiYoga Paradise.
 

What We Need & What You Get
Somehow we need to bring together a large amount of money. More than we Tara and Inti have and so we asked for a loan to Inti's family, which they might be willing to grant provided that our idea of crowdfunding proves succesful. That would come to a third of the price. Then we had a third partner who regretfully backed out, So that left us with too high installments over the next 5 years. That's what made the offer of the other so tempting. But we would love to keep it in the family, and so does Rohan, in his heart. So there is the deal; show proof of our financial credibillity by magically raising a substantial amount of money in a really short time; so we came up with say 108.000€ in a week time. We brought that down to an initial 30.000€ set as goal for this campaign to sweeten the prospect of succes.
The maths go like this; Average we invite 20 friends, who invite their 20 friends (makes 400 reached) they invite theirs in 2nd step (8000 reached) and only one step further we aim to reach near 160.000 people ! If only actually 7% donate 10 € that makes 112.000€ !! Too good to be true ? Check the maths. 
We invite you, as a friend suggested, to for one day skip your coffee, beer or lunch whatever, and donate the saving to the fund, and feel the better, healthier even, for it ?!
There is more to it; you can taste from what you help preserve and grow; we offer ""rewards"" !
in short;   WHY? WHAT WOULD YOU WIN BY IT?
First of all; our eternal deeply felt gratitude!
Second; the knowledge that you contributed saving and furthering the growth of a beautiful Yoga-Paradise on earth, on Crete.
Third; If you like, we put you on the mailing list and so you can be notified when and how to experience firsthand the joy of yogic lifestyle, of what you helped to fund. See below under “Retreats”. 
The fourth reason is the fruits; the REWARDS offered, aligned to the amount donated, ranging from beautiful Calendars to a chance of free retreat in Crete or at Sunfoodyoga Retreats in Spain, as part of the retreat-lottery option, and more…. see under “rewards”

Without a free flow of air into the bottle to replace the water taken out, you end up sucking against a vacuum. After three years of playing with different approaches, we came up with the dual ball valve design. When open, the ParaValve dual ball valve system has a large zero resistance air flow, so there is no vacuum produced; This also means you can drink quietly without your bottle announcing it with a whistle.   The air path is 9 times as big as the pin hole valve used on the Hydro Flask straw lid, while the water path is twice as big (the Hydro Flask uses in internal straw connection that creates a flow restriction). When the spout is closed, both ball valves close, making it fully leak-proof.Want the technical details?The dual ball valve design is patent pending. If you would like a more detailed explanation of what's wrong with other straw lids and how the ParaValve is better, watch our explainer video below.

 
Effortless HydrationThe drinking effort of our lid is as low or lower than just putting a straw into a glass. How can this be? There is certainly no vacuum built up in the glass, but the straw rests on the bottom of the glass, which creates some flow restriction. With a straw lid, the straw is held by the lid, so the bottom of the straw floats above the bottom of the bottle. Although a straw in a glass drinks easy, the ParaValve is even easier. If you want a preview of what drinking from the ParaValve straw lid is like, place a straw into a glass of your favorite beverage, hold the straw off the bottom and sip.World's First Insulated Straw LidAn insulated bottle deserves an insulated lid. We wanted to create the best straw lid available anywhere, so we  added an insulating layer, making it the first straw lid to offer insulation.If you are using an insulated bottle, it will help keep cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot. We tested our lid against the Hydro Flask lid using a 40 oz. Hydro Flask vacuum insulated bottle. No surprise - cold and hot - it performs much better! See our full test results here.Unlike the single wall lid pictured above, ice water is no sweat for the double wall of the ParaValve, keeping your other belongings dry.Safe for hot liquids up to 140 degrees (60 deg. C).Most other straw lids are limited to cold drinks. Now you can enjoy drinking your coffee or tea through a straw - but please be careful! The high flow of the straw can burn your mouth if the liquid is too hot.We don't recommend using the ParaValve straw with liquids hotter than 140 degrees (60 deg. C); the high flow rate could burn your mouth.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>IQYOU Health is a HIPAA-compliant health platform that takes a deep look at your <strong>DNA/genomics</strong>, <strong>Biochemistry</strong> (through labs), and <strong>Epigenetics </strong>(family history, diet, lifestyle, medications, activity level, and toxin exposure) to produce a <strong>360° full-body health blueprint</strong>, to help you <i>get to the root cause of chronic conditions</i> and <i>optimize your health</i>. </p>
<p>IQYOU does this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding your <strong>EpiBioGenetic®</strong> vulnerabilities and risk factors</li>
<li>Isolating the right <strong>diet </strong>and <strong>nutrients</strong> needed for you based on your <strong>EpiBioGenetics®</strong>
</li>
<li>Reducing your dependence on pharmaceuticals and medications</li>
<li>Building long-lasting health, so you feel better and have fewer trips to the doctor</li>

<p>We currently do not have a healthcare system, but a<strong> Sick-Care system</strong> with<i> </i><strong><i>big pharmaceutical </i>companies masking your symptoms and keeping you sick</strong> rather than working to get to the root cause of the problem. With so many variables for preventative care, there’s never been a good solution to provide <strong>personalization of health, until now</strong>.</p>
<p>The power of <strong>IQYOU</strong> is in <strong>simplifying the complexities of staying healthy</strong> to provide a real roadmap for your best health, all based on science. Finally, a smart tool that can guide your best health at the touch of a button.<br/> </p>

<p>DNA is an important part of your <strong>EpiBioGenetic</strong>® profile, which also includes non-genetic factors, such as your diet, lifestyle, environment, and body chemistry.</p>

<p>This is very important, because when you get the right nutrients to make your liver and other organs work as well as they potentially can, you are generally able to start the process of healing from within, which is our ultimate goal.</p>

<p><strong>IQYOU DNA</strong> is a comprehensive gene test integrated into the <strong>IQYOU Health platform</strong> to help you understand how your mind and body work, so you can minimize health risks and live smarter.</p>
<p><strong>IQYOU DNA </strong>is much more robust than some other DNA tests on the market. Other tests have far fewer SNPs in their DNA array (while<strong> IQYOU DNA has 350+ SNPs embedded</strong>) and do not look at Biochemistry or Epigenetics to show you what is REALLY happening in your body. Other tests simply focus on your ancestry instead of health.  With IQYOU, we want to take a deep look at how your<strong> Genes, Lifestyle, and Biochemistry work TOGETHER to affect your health</strong>.</p>
<p>It's easy to use -- just a saliva swab.  There's no blood.  No needles.  And it integrates directly into the IQYOU platform.  Once your test results are ready, they are loaded into your secure profile and color-coded and organized for you in priority order, with the most important action steps to take listed first.<br/> </p>

<p>Many DNA laboratories require you to spend hundreds of dollars to analyze just 20-30 gene variants in only one body system!  The IQYOU DNA test covers over <u><strong>350+</strong></u> key gene variants (called “SNPs”) across multiple body systems.</p>
<p><strong>IQYOU DNA</strong> looks at gene variants that not only add to your risk for common conditions (such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), but we look for those that have clear physiological effects, with related lifestyle, dietary, and nutritional interventions. </p>
<p><strong>IQYOU is the only technology on the market today able to put this level of computational analysis to work for you!</strong></p>

<p>As they are released, toxins interfere with normal bodily functions, according to their chemical structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pesticides</strong>, for example, tend to interfere with nerve or hormone function</li>
<li>
<strong>Plasticizers</strong> act like estrogen</li>
<li>Various other chemicals interfere with DNA transcription or various enzyme or hormonal functions</li>
<li>
<strong>Heavy metals</strong> interfere with brain, immune and enzyme function at various points throughout the body</li>

<p>There is <strong>no organ in the body that is not potentially harmed by toxic exposures</strong>,  which can produce a very wide range of possible symptoms. The key to regaining normal function is effective detoxification – effective removal of toxic materials from the body.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Over the past year, our software team has been working closely with our science team on streamlining the A.I. and the user interface to make it easy and understandable for both doctors and patients. We envision IQYOU to be a tool you login to weekly to get recipes, nutrient information and lifestyle/exercise goals customized just for you. With that being said, we cannot control everything, in any case of delays we promise to communicate with transparency and work around the clock to ensure your expectations are met!</p>
<p><i>If you are outside the United States, customs fees and duties may be required in order to obtain your order. Customs and duties are the responsibility of the buyer. We have no control over how long it takes for international orders to arrive. Please note that many international orders will be routed through a country other than that of its final destination. This is normal and is done to ensure a more secure delivery internationally. </i></p>
</div></div>","Overview
IQYOU Health is a HIPAA-compliant health platform that takes a deep look at your DNA/genomics, Biochemistry (through labs), and Epigenetics (family history, diet, lifestyle, medications, activity level, and toxin exposure) to produce a 360° full-body health blueprint, to help you get to the root cause of chronic conditions and optimize your health. 
IQYOU does this by:

Finding your EpiBioGenetic® vulnerabilities and risk factors
Isolating the right diet and nutrients needed for you based on your EpiBioGenetics®

Reducing your dependence on pharmaceuticals and medications
Building long-lasting health, so you feel better and have fewer trips to the doctor

 

 


 



We currently do not have a healthcare system, but a Sick-Care system with big pharmaceutical companies masking your symptoms and keeping you sick rather than working to get to the root cause of the problem. With so many variables for preventative care, there’s never been a good solution to provide personalization of health, until now.
The power of IQYOU is in simplifying the complexities of staying healthy to provide a real roadmap for your best health, all based on science. Finally, a smart tool that can guide your best health at the touch of a button. 


Based on the concept of EpiBioGenetics®, IQYOU is the only health assessment tool in the world that combines data from all three critical wellness components to give you an individualized blueprint to improve your health.  We assess genetic susceptibility and lower body burdens of toxic environmental factors through avoidance and detoxification.
 


 

Embedded in the platform are thousands of data points (which map risks and solutions) including over 40,000 clinical studies, 1,000+ prescription drugs, numerous articles and studies on nutrition, supplements, herbs, lifestyle issues as well as EPA environmental studies.
 

 
Start by filling out an initial health assessment (dealing with your lifestyle, eating habits, sleep, stress, toxins, exercise habits, medications & family history).  As you answer, our algorithms will generate follow-up ""smart questions"" designed                to dig deeper into specific areas of health relevant to you.
 
 Based on the data provided, IQYOU will generate an initial Health Score for you, compute known toxic risks based on your location, and recommend certain lab tests to dig deeper and gather more data about particular areas of your health.  
 
 Upload your DNA.  We offer a proprietary IQYOU DNA kit that is comprehensive and private and covers the full list of genes we need to look at for your health.  Or if you already have 23andme, you can upload your raw data as a start as well. 
 
* Please note that 23andme only reports on less than half of the DNA SNPs we need.  For a full report, we recommend using IQYOU DNA. 
 

 

 
DNA is an important part of your EpiBioGenetic® profile, which also includes non-genetic factors, such as your diet, lifestyle, environment, and body chemistry.
IQYOU genomic testing tells you what specific chemicals you most need to avoid, and also which nutritional factors (vitamins, minerals, dietary changes) will make your detox enzymes work more normally.  
This is very important, because when you get the right nutrients to make your liver and other organs work as well as they potentially can, you are generally able to start the process of healing from within, which is our ultimate goal.

 

 
The system will begin to cross-reference all this information against our internal database of 40,000+ medical studies, drug profiles, and nutritional information to provide the user with a customized action plan for improving and maintaining their own unique health.
 

 
Suggestions are presented right on your 'Dashboard' and may include:


Recommended Lifestyle Choices: Our system will make lifestyle suggestions and rank them from critical to inconsequential so that you know which changes to make first.

Nutrient Balance: Based on hundreds of personal data points, IQYOU will suggest prioritizing the most important vitamins, minerals, and amino acids you need right now to optimize your health.

Diet Changes: In conjunction with vitamin and mineral balance, IQYOU is being designed to alert you about foods that may be harmful to your unique biochemistry. It will also recommend important foods for you as well as recipes to help you optimize your diet.

Genetic Red Flags: By analyzing your Genomic profile, IQYOU will inform you about risks to your biochemistry, so that you know what potential actions to take to best optimize your health and lifestyle.

 


 

Track Your Health Over Time. Gain Evolving Insights.      IQYOU is There for YOU.  
 

 
IQYOU DNA is a comprehensive gene test integrated into the IQYOU Health platform to help you understand how your mind and body work, so you can minimize health risks and live smarter.
IQYOU DNA is much more robust than some other DNA tests on the market. Other tests have far fewer SNPs in their DNA array (while IQYOU DNA has 350+ SNPs embedded) and do not look at Biochemistry or Epigenetics to show you what is REALLY happening in your body. Other tests simply focus on your ancestry instead of health.  With IQYOU, we want to take a deep look at how your Genes, Lifestyle, and Biochemistry work TOGETHER to affect your health.
It's easy to use -- just a saliva swab.  There's no blood.  No needles.  And it integrates directly into the IQYOU platform.  Once your test results are ready, they are loaded into your secure profile and color-coded and organized for you in priority order, with the most important action steps to take listed first. 

 
Many DNA laboratories require you to spend hundreds of dollars to analyze just 20-30 gene variants in only one body system!  The IQYOU DNA test covers over 350+ key gene variants (called “SNPs”) across multiple body systems.
IQYOU DNA looks at gene variants that not only add to your risk for common conditions (such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), but we look for those that have clear physiological effects, with related lifestyle, dietary, and nutritional interventions. 
IQYOU is the only technology on the market today able to put this level of computational analysis to work for you!
 
 


 
 

As they are released, toxins interfere with normal bodily functions, according to their chemical structure:


Pesticides, for example, tend to interfere with nerve or hormone function

Plasticizers act like estrogen
Various other chemicals interfere with DNA transcription or various enzyme or hormonal functions

Heavy metals interfere with brain, immune and enzyme function at various points throughout the body

Chemicals, molds, and metals also affect the gut, the liver, pancreas, and so on

There is no organ in the body that is not potentially harmed by toxic exposures,  which can produce a very wide range of possible symptoms. The key to regaining normal function is effective detoxification – effective removal of toxic materials from the body.
 
 

 

 
 

 
No. In fact, IQYOU is meant to make your existing healthcare more streamlined and productive, so you're more aware of your own health. It's important for you to understand the toxins, foods, nutrients and lifestyle factors that are impacting your genes and your biochemistry.
IQYOU is build to collaborate with your health professionals. With everyone working from your same health blueprint, you can maximize your health potential.
IQYOU enables both you and your practitioner to quickly analyze thousands of data points about YOU and provide more accurate, personalized recommendations around food, nutrients, and toxins, so you feel better faster and optimize your body’s ability to perform.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Smart Company - Big Problem - Large Market! Potential Unicorn!</p>
<p>My Name is Tony StCyr. I've been in Radio &amp; Television most of my adult life. I've owned 2 radio stations, operated 4 Cable TV Channels &amp; I am currently the CEO and Founder of Witty Inventions. I've invented a few things over my lifetime but nothing as helpful &amp; beneficial to people as my latest invention I call the ""Nose T"". Since I was a child I dealt with nosebleeds. About 12 years ago I discovered a safe &amp; natural way to stop a nosebleed in 5 seconds. I decided this discovery needed to be shared so I filed a patent and started developing and testing prototypes. Since i couldn't walk up &amp; punch people in the nose it took some time to test! :) Along the way I sold my home, 2 cars, emptied my savings account &amp; cashed in my retirement. In 2018 and 2019 I picked up a few friends who believed in my product and invested in my company. This helped us get the Nose T to where we are today.</p>
<p>Last year we did some testing at a Tattoo Shop and discovered that the Nose T stops bleeding on the exterior of the nose during and after nose piercing procedures. This discovery has opened an avenue to help people that wasn't even on our radar a year ago. The device is amazing and we have never had it fail on anyone we've tried it on and have never had any returned for a refund.</p>
<p>Children and the elderly are the two most at risk groups. Since nosebleeds are a huge problem &amp; blood can be a bio hazard to others, I'm committed to helping get this item throughout the US and the world as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>We also are donating Nose T's to Schools, Children's Hospitals and other non profit organizations. </p>
<p>By helping us get this product into the hands of the right people you are helping us alleviate millions of nosebleed sufferers fears &amp; embarrassment, and help keep the environment around us safer.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I am currently seeking $250,000.00. This is the amount we feel we need to get The Nose T on the shelves of Major Department stores including, Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreens and others as well as enable us to purchase much needed counter/shelf displays, additional inventory &amp; additional labor for filling orders. </p>
<p>Everyone who donates will receive a PERK! We are also matching &amp; donate an equal amount of Nose T's to Children's Hospitals and/or Nursing Facilities, etc., for every Nose T we send out. </p>
<p>We are optimistic that we will reach our goal of $250,000.00. In the event we fall short we will use the funds that are raised to order as much packaging and inventory that we need. We will also employ as many people as we can with funds that remain after packaging and inventory is ordered including a sales representative(s). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you or someone you know has nosebleeds then you know the inconvenience and mess that it can cause. I had a nosebleed once for 30 minutes and it really scared me. Some people have even been rushed to the hospital for fear of bleeding out. In some parts of the country and the world an Ambulance or a Hospital could be hours away. We already have a few Nose T's in South &amp; Central America, Egypt, China, Canada &amp; other countries, but our goal is to get this device into high risk areas as soon as possible and not just in the United States. We have are actually hoping to donate Nose T's to the UN in the near future to get these into the poor &amp; isolated areas of the world.</p>
<p>As I stated earlier I have owned and operated 6 Broadcast/Cable entities that were highly successful. I've manged lots of employees and dealt with 1000's of businesses in my career. You can be assured that I have the experience and the determination to see this through. People need this device. Soldiers &amp; Military personnel need this device. The possibilities are endless &amp; I'm counting on nice people like you to help us achieve our World Wide goal!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We personally feel that at the stage in the development the majority of the risk has been mitigated. I have a great board of directors and we had a Business Development Firm advising us throughout much of 2019. Now we have two. According to the BDF we had a 7,000% increase in value as we scaled and operationalized the business to the next levels. The BDF also predicted that the company would be a Unicorn (1 Billion Dollar Business) in the near future if we didn't exit too soon.</p>
<p>Currently there are no products on the market that would be considered ""competition"" so the market is wide open to us. Getting into foreign markets will be a huge challenge with the risk of product theft and duplication. But we feel if we establish the Nose T quickly in those risky global markets and with the new China-US agreement now in place the risks are reduced.</p>

The Awesome Thoracic Belt SystemPicture yourself running. Your hands naturally swing by your thorax making it very convenient to store and retrieve small personal items in the two subpectoral pockets without any impact on your running form. No need to stop or modify your gait to securely store a car key your friend just handed to you or to retrieve a gel. The Thoracic Belt has a gentle stretch (retraction force) which locks all items in place. Nothing moves. No bouncing is possible and the retraction force is calculated to be soft enough to not affect breathing. This Patent Pending invention is incredibly useful during vigorous activities, especially runners who want to safely carry a few personal items.The right pocket has three mini-slots to put away loose coins, a key, lip balm stick, or maybe a beautiful shell you pick up during your morning run so they do not rattle during your peaceful run! 2. The amazing Fidlock™ Magnetic FastenerThe Fidlock system combines two fastening concepts in one: a magnetic snap and a mechanical lock that clips tightly around 1 of 3 positions, offering useful adjustments while on the run.  Fidlock revolutionizes traditional fastening systems. 3. All-Weather, No Bouncing Phone Slot Cell phones are important for security, communication, music, orientation and training logs (apps).  They're so essential, we see people running with them in their hands daily. When asked if they'd prefer to stick it in FITLY and the reaction is always the same.  Cell phones are expensive, what if it rains?   You need to protect it!FITLY's Phone Slot is exactly designed to host your cell phone with two significant advantages over almost any other solution:
Your cell phone is locked into place in a pouch that sticks to your body, follows its every move so bouncing is impossible.
FITLY is water resistant. Your phone is protected from the toughest weather.
With today's headphone button, voice control, and smartwatches, hundreds of phone commands are readily available without the need to stop and access your phone:  Play Music, Skip, Answer/hang up, Call home, Play Radio, Hear messages, etc. Your phone is tucked away, entirely protected from the weather yet perfectly available. 
Phone in: slide and lock it in.    Phone Out: a nifty drawing mechanism makes it easy to pull your phone out.   Your headphone cable is routed through the cable slot and special webbings on the straps so loose cables do not dangle. 4. High-Durability CORDURA® FabricConstructed using high tenacity military-grade fiber technologies, the CORDURA® fabric is exceptionally durable and puncture resistant. Our prototypes have been used hundreds of time, under heavy rain, and gallons of sweat with no sign of deterioration.  The fabric is ""best in class"", used in high-end mountain guide equipment, made to endure the toughest weather.FITLY IS MADE TO LAST!  5. A nice touch of Green Innovation.S.Café® is an eco-friendly (Cradle to Cradle certified) soft fabric that combines nylon yarns and recycled ground coffee at the cellular level. The fascinating benefit is natural odor resistance.  Green innovation is a win-win!  The S.Café® fabric also naturally cools your skin temperature down!Sweat, drizzle, pouring rain, FITLY’s 200% UltraWick is a techno-fabric that drains moisture and leaves you dry.  So soft, wear it on your bare skin!Run, sweat, rinse, hang… repeat!   6. Silent Zipper TabsFITLY is equipped with YKK special noise-free zipper tabs.  The tabs cannot move when you run so annoying ticking noise are impossible.  Silence is gold. 7. Smart Multi-CompartmentsAll you need for a quick run precisely fits in one of FITLY’s multiple compartments. 

One Large pocket with your phone slot and a larger compartment where many types of items can be stored.  

Two Medium pockets on the back to store keys, additional gels, credit cards, ID, cash, etc. 
A clever “secret"" Side pocket with a vertical zip to store your most valuable items as well as hydration up to 400 ml/13.5Oz if needed.   
All water resistant. NB: We have posted a list of items designed to be stored for each pocket sizes at the bottom of the page.  8. X-Shape Body Symmetry  Using the steadiness of your upper back and chest area, FITLY’s X-Shape distributes the weight to snugly fit your body contour.  It allows free running movements while preserving total body symmetry.  A pleasant feeling of wearing almost nothing…  9. Bilateral CleverAdjustFITLY has five easy adjustments to make it your own: 

Two bilateral straps adjustments to lower the belt (up and down) so it is correctly positioned below the pectoral muscles. 

Two bilateral thoracic belt adjustments to reach sizes varying from 26 in/67 cm (XS) to 40 in/1052 cm (XL).  Your band size is calculated below the pectoral muscles/breasts (same as a cardio or the bottom portion of a bra (band)).  
The fifth adjustment is the three-pronged Fidlock Fastening System (see above) with 1 in/2.5 cm micro-adjustments at the front of the belt, useful while running.
 10. Packed with Water Resistance  Drizzle or pour, the PU-coated Cordura fabric is water-resistant. It does not make FITLY waterproof but resistant to endure the toughest weather!  
The phone slot brings additional moisture protection to the phone.  
A fully waterproof liner separates your back from the pockets making it impossible for sweat to affect the pockets' contents.  
No need to time the weather, postpone a work-out or try to outrun the oncoming storm.  No need for a plastic bag either!  Just keep on running and know your valuables are protected.  Very useful!  11. Safety Reflective Bands  Front and back safety reflective bands as well as silver reflective logos for your night adventures. See and be seen!  Also available is a 2-inch long webbing to attach an additional light.  It is especially important for bikers on an early morning ride.   12. WhistleTrivial but important, we placed a mini whistle directly in the front pocket so it can be immediately accessed.  FITLY is a running accessory made for quick runs. The majority of people (85%) we surveyed run with 2 or more items, the most frequent are Cell Phones and keys (car, house, hotel). Of the 15% remaining, half would prefer having their cell phone for security and communication in the case of an incident but had not found a suitable way to carry it. For longer runs, where hydration and heavier gear affects performance, lots of options already exist.  Hydration is important but less of a focus in short runs (sub 45 min).  You can carry 130 ml/4.4 oz jugs or flasks in one of the front pockets and about 3X as much in the secret pocket. ...you can do less!  Light and thin FITLY is also a clever solution to carry small personal items for travel, day trips, and less vigorous activities, such as kayaking, walking, hiking or just a visit to the museum or a city event. For travel, stick your passport or wallet in the “secret” side pocket for added protection. Wear your FITLY under your jacket for complete security. Three different color accents and 2 sizes.  FITLY covers sizes from 26 In/67 cm to 40 In/102 cm (under breast measurement), which spans from XS to XL.  Once you have pledged, we will reach out to you for your color and size selections.    Since we launched FITLY, we have gathered 1000+ Positive Feedbacks!Some were goosebumps worthy: “I love FITLY!

Hey there!  I'm  A.D., maker of iON Performance Soak.
iON was developed from a need to prepare for and recover from intense athletic performances. 
Over the past year, I have channeled my athletic experience, passion for solving problems and helping people and 10 years of marketing experience in healthcare and wellness to develop and introduce iON to market. 
We have had strong interest and success to date and this campaign will not only allow us to scale the production and marketing of iON Soak, but lay the foundation to evolve iON from a novel crafted product to the Personal Care brand of choice for athletes and highly active people.

What We Need 
The objective of the campaign is to raise $20,000 to meet immediate needs and opportunities including. This Indiegogo campaign is part of a larger fundraising initiative for the brand.

Refining our retail packaging per request of highly interested retailers who've agreed to stock iON after a few packaging upgrades
Scale up production and logistics 
Increase our ability to leverage economies of scale in purchasing ingredients and supplies
Supporting geo-targeted experiential and digital promotion to drive traffic to new retailers


Why iON?
Rapidly growing participation in competitive sport, e.g. CrossFit, triathlons and masters level athletes are increasing the number of people involved in highly intensive athletic activities…around 4 Million by our count...
Those who engage in this high intense activity take on three distinct personal care needs

Priming for Competition
Coping with Physiologic Demands of Intense Activity
Transitioning to the next activity in their busy lives

iON endeavors to be the Athlete’s Personal Care Brand of Choice

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Prior to writing this summary regarding our Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign, I leaned towards writing more from the perspective of the company, trying my best to avoid the story of my life. However, after further consideration and sound advice from great people, I can now see the importance in sharing my remarkably life-changing story to the public to both motivate and inspire others in situations like mine, my goal in life. As you can read below, I once studied mixed martial arts and while sparring at an every-day practice, I broke my neck and was left partially paralyzed. Although it was a very tragic moment, I found that my focus and determination made it fairly easy to shift my direction to one goal that I've always had in mind prior to fighting, business school. Along with continuous personal physical therapy, I kept in direct contact with a lot of the disabled community around me and discovered several problems, or what some may call, needs. This leads me to the introduction of a start-up company, FuseFit LLC, whose focus is to provide at-home and on-demand personal trainers to the homes of the disabled and elderly, who often find inaccessibility and transportation to be their number one struggle. Our company's vision is to be the number one choice for optimizing both fitness and nutrition for all the disabled and elder communities around the world. Knowing exactly what these marginalized communities experience, first-hand, and providing alternatives is exactly why this is the industry exactly where I was destined to sow my seed. Our company is starting a Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign to raise money for both the establishment of our patented software application and a operational fund until reaching our next stage of development. All contributions come with one or more small rewards that will be rewarded to each contributor following a successful crowdfunding campaign. <strong>Not a single donation will be overlooked</strong>. Each contributor should keep in mind that they are providing a much-needed opportunity to fuse that gap that stands between one's limits and their independence.</p>
<p><strong>Where’s my money going?</strong></p>
<p>For the sake of being transparent and accountable with all contributors and backers, the money that will be raised is transferred, following a successful campaign, into FuseFit's bank account and allocated in the departments <i>as shown in figure 1</i>: 8.5% fees for Indiegogo, 18.5% will go into Application Development, 25% allocated into Operations, 13% allocated towards Accounting, and the remaining 35% will be allocated towards Marketing.</p>

Short Summary

Hello everyone,
Prior to writing this summary regarding our Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign, I leaned towards writing more from the perspective of the company, trying my best to avoid the story of my life. However, after further consideration and sound advice from great people, I can now see the importance in sharing my remarkably life-changing story to the public to both motivate and inspire others in situations like mine, my goal in life. As you can read below, I once studied mixed martial arts and while sparring at an every-day practice, I broke my neck and was left partially paralyzed. Although it was a very tragic moment, I found that my focus and determination made it fairly easy to shift my direction to one goal that I've always had in mind prior to fighting, business school. Along with continuous personal physical therapy, I kept in direct contact with a lot of the disabled community around me and discovered several problems, or what some may call, needs. This leads me to the introduction of a start-up company, FuseFit LLC, whose focus is to provide at-home and on-demand personal trainers to the homes of the disabled and elderly, who often find inaccessibility and transportation to be their number one struggle. Our company's vision is to be the number one choice for optimizing both fitness and nutrition for all the disabled and elder communities around the world. Knowing exactly what these marginalized communities experience, first-hand, and providing alternatives is exactly why this is the industry exactly where I was destined to sow my seed. Our company is starting a Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign to raise money for both the establishment of our patented software application and a operational fund until reaching our next stage of development. All contributions come with one or more small rewards that will be rewarded to each contributor following a successful crowdfunding campaign. Not a single donation will be overlooked. Each contributor should keep in mind that they are providing a much-needed opportunity to fuse that gap that stands between one's limits and their independence.
Where’s my money going?
For the sake of being transparent and accountable with all contributors and backers, the money that will be raised is transferred, following a successful campaign, into FuseFit's bank account and allocated in the departments as shown in figure 1: 8.5% fees for Indiegogo, 18.5% will go into Application Development, 25% allocated into Operations, 13% allocated towards Accounting, and the remaining 35% will be allocated towards Marketing.

<li>
<strong>Benzoin</strong>: Typically found on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, the benzoin tree produces resin extract, which is a mild antibacterial. As an essential oil, it helps eliminate infection-causing bacteria from the surface of the skin. It actively heals dry, cracked skin and is also<p>good for arthritic pains.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cloves</strong>: Due to its antiseptic properties, clove oil is useful for wound, cuts, scabies, athlete’s foot, fungal infections, bruises, prickly heat, scabies, and other types of injuries. It can also be used for treating insect bites and stings and is an excellent insect repellant thanks to the distinct aroma.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nutmeg</strong>: Mixed into a balm, it can make skin look clearer and brighter within a few days, reducing scars and alleviating acne. It also brings relief from muscular and joint pain. Apply it to a localised area of swelling and discomfort, and the pain melts away.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cinnamon</strong>: It has antibacterial, anti-fungal, antimicrobial and anti-clotting properties, and is rich in essential minerals such as manganese, iron and calcium, while also having a high content of fibre. Cinnamon oil acts as a coagulant and helps to stop excess bleeding, therefore, facilitating the healing process. It is also a fantastic insect repellant.</p></li>

<p>We have had some wonderful testimonials from our customers who have used and are using Pommade Divine during their pregnancies. However, since everyone’s response to the physical and hormonal changes of pregnancy is different, we would recommend that you perform a patch test if using for the first time. If there are any specific uncertainties, we recommend you consult your GP before use.</p>
</div></div>","Pommade Divine for on-the-go
We know our customers love Pommade Divine, so much so they want to take it everywhere with them - on holiday, to the gym, out shopping. Even though our 50ml jar is beautiful and perfect for the bathroom cabinet or bedside table, it just isn't designed for that kind of use.

Over the last 18 months we have worked hard with our formulator and manufacturer to develop Pommade Divine for on-the-go. We tested, tested, and tested some more - until we finally cracked it. The result is our natural, trusted formula now available in a travel-friendly 30ml tube, perfectly compact and light enough to put in your handbag, carry-on luggage or even pocket.  
 
Why are we crowdfunding?
In order to bring you the Pommade Divine you so love, we have made the decision to order a larger quantity upfront so that we can get lower costs and in turn, lower prices for our customers.

Our Story
Every brand has a story, but Pommade Divine's is truly remarkable. First written about in the 1700s by Princess Elisabeth Charlotte (Marie-Antoinette's great-grandmother), she insisted it was ""the best thing if you had burned yourself with sealing wax. ""

Known as ""nanny's magic cream"", Pommade Divine was a staple household good during the Edwardian and Victorian era for any skincare need - bumps, bruises, burns, chapped hands, lips, nappy rash - even to heal cuts after sitting on one's pocket watch... 
But then in the 1980s, Pommade Divine disappeared off the shelves. Luckily, it was bought by a family who knew of its wonderful properties and kept it going selling to family and friends.  
A few years ago, we decided to revive the recipe originally developed by Butler & Co., chemists to the Royal Household in 1800, and bring this British heritage jewel back to the public. 
Pommade Divine is available today in some of the most iconic premium retailers such as Liberty London, Colette in Paris and luxury e-retailer Net-à-Porter, as well as carefully selected specialist health & beauty boutiques all over the world.

<p><b>Our objective</b>:
<b>To raise S20,000 -</b>To build 4 wells
in Africa </p>
<p><b>Our Aim:</b> To provide
Clean safe drinking water that does not carry water borne diseases</p>
<p><b>Our Moto:</b>
Let’s take the first step in fighting poverty. </p>
<p><b>Cost/well : </b>Estimate AUD$5000/per well</p>
<p><b>Background
</b></p>
<p>Africa has been suffering from
poverty for over 50 years. One of the main indicators that could aid them from
poverty is water. An average human can survive one month without food but only
one week without water. Clean water is essential for survival especially in
Africa. People are affected by contaminated water and lack of basic sanitation.
More people are being killed by polluted water and no proper sanitation
compared to violence in the country, such as war. The ones most affected by
this are children as their bodies are not strong enough to fight diseases such Astrachoma, Hepatitis,
Typhoid, Malaria, Sleeping Sickness and Meningitis.. </p>
<p>The United Nations reported that 20% of the
world’s population struggle to gain access to safe drinking water every day.In Africa alone, people spend 40 billion hours every year
walking to the nearest water source. Furthermore, on average, women in Africa
walk 6 kilometers to get water and the water source may or may not be clean due
to being prone to contamination. Time spent walking result in diseases keeping
them away from school, work and taking care of their families. Along their long
walk, they're subjected to a greater risk of harassment and sexual assault.
With safe water nearby, women are free to pursue new opportunities and improve
their families’ lives (charitywater.org, 2015/)</p>
<p>The only way to fight poverty is to
educate and to maintain the health of the people. Water has a
vital role to play in responding to the socio-economic crisis in Africa. Thus the first step to fight poverty in Africa is to provide
safe water nearest to their dwelling, which may than lead to women and children
having time for school, work and lessen the risk of harassment and sexual
assaults. Moreover, the only way to make a big difference in this world is to
start small and this is one way to help the human population.</p>
<p><b>Water - Facts:</b><br/>
•  Diseases related to water are caused either by the lack of water or drinking polluted water.<br/>
•  Such diseases include trachoma, hepatitis, typhoid, polio,
malaria, sleeping sickness and meningitis. <br/>
•  Trachoma alone is the main cause of blindness of 6 million
people worldwide. <br/>
•  2.4 billion people (nearly the half of world’s population)
do not have access to adequate water supplies.<br/>
•  2.2 million people in developing countries die every year
from diseases related to lack of water and drinking unsafe water.<br/>
•  Around 6,000 children – most of them less than 5 years of
age - die every day from water-borne diseases.<br/>
•  The average distance that women in Africa and Asia walk
every day to collect water is 6 km.</p>

Any changes will always be for the benefit of you, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.</p><p>FULFILLMENT:<strong> </strong>Despite the best planning, there may be factors that we cannot control such as equipment malfunction, transport or supplier delays. While we hope that your support on Indiegogo will enable us to begin production on a commercial scale, we have no idea as to whether it will be 'business as usual' for us or an overwhelming demand. If more people than we anticipate want a Brush Effects Toothbrush, we may have to scale up the factory or set up additional manufacturing in other facilities, or purchase more equipment.

Going into the Future we together can make a monumental change in the way we brush our teeth, our overall oral care health and saving our precious water resources. The Cost FactorWe spend a lot on electronics for ourselves and our children, It would be cool to see their faces when they get one of these and smile through their daily brushings, adults too. The Toothbrush - The one thing that can prevent many types of sicknesses and diseases, prevent cavities from forming, gum disease, gingivitis, mouth cancers etc. A toothbrush costs us only a buck a month that's it, but it is the care taker of our mouths, teeth and overall health. As you read on I will say this now -Your child  would love a Brush Effects Toothbrush and so would you. The Green Factor - Save our Precious Water PleaseAn amazing thing Brush Effects excels at - The environment and water wastage is becoming such a serious debate the world over. Think about this - 55% of people who brush their teeth run the water non stop till they are done, especially kids (How many kids in each household? - Scary!! that's gallons per person wasted every day ) The @BrushEffects toothbrush is the future, when you use our toothbrush you get 60% faster brushing times, for those people who run water non stop, that equals to 60-70% less water wastage per person. Let's all be stewards of our Earth and save it's precious water resources, right now. Look at what's happening in California right now and other areas of the world, massive droughts. They are seeking ideas in which people will conserve water. Your contribution helps us move forward one of the biggest oral care tech products that saves millions of gallons of water per day. This small little - Futuristic - Highly Designed Brush Effects toothbrush could be one of the single most important factors in saving our precious water resources.  Buy A Perk and help us give you amazingly fresh breath, clean teeth. Plus 100% more germ removal  and 60% faster than before (brushing time).  LIFE We all know one of the most dreaded parts of our days are mornings. We have to climb out of bed and get ready for our day. And if you have children..... well, need I say more? Brushing our teeth is a love or hate daily task we all must do in order to have healthy gums, clean teeth and proper oral care health. Improper oral care is the leading cause of many sicknesses and disease, all of which can be reduced or eliminated by brushing teeth properly and removing inner mouth germs. With our Brush Effects Toothbrush Technology we went to great lengths to make sure we created a toothbrush design that greatly enhanced the oral care experience. We wanted faster brushing, a cleaner mouth, cleaner- whiter teeth, a toothbrush that could also give you flossing action for the first time ever, and a wider tongue scraper area and inner mouth scrapers. Plus, we added all these features to our toothbrush in a size comparable to today's current toothbrush, now that's INNOVATION! The head of our toothbrush is 2mm smaller in length and 2mm wider that the current toothbrush we all use. We have 4x the features in a comparable size. As you can see above, our Brush Effects Toothbrush, brushes all 3 sides of your teeth, plus our scrapers clean your mouth so amazingly, even you will be shocked at how clean and fresh your mouth and teeth will be. You get amazingly clean teeth front to back. Lifting food particles to the surface. The old tech just pushed food back and forth back into teeth and the back areas were always too tough to clean properly. I have three daughters and my business partners have children too. We know and understand how hard it is to get children to not only brush their teeth, but to ensure they do it properly.  We pretty much have to stand by them while they do it. And do they really brush their teeth properly? The answer, 90% of the time, is no they don't.The Great news is, with the Brush Effects toothbrush, that is no longer the case. They will brush all three surface areas of their teeth properly, and faster, every single time, and love doing it- and so will you. Adults and children will have an amazingly clean, germ free mouth. We are making the whole brushing experience fun for kids and adults of all ages. Make sure to watch our video before you read any further. That way you will experience all Brush Effects is, today, tomorrow and into the future.I want to make sure about one thing right now, innovation will never progress unless we have backers like you. We need to build a huge fan base, and kindly ask that you please share our Brush Effects Indiegogo page with your friends, family and even your friends with blogs. Use the hash tag #BrushEffects, then post a Selfie with that hashtag with you showing the world one huge smile on Facebook and Twitter.

Improper oral care leads to expensive Dental Bills. Brush Effects is here to take oral care into the future. Families 1st I just wanted to make sure I acknowledge you first; you are the most important factor here to helping us make Brush Effects a Global hit. Remember: Your Teeth are the track, our toothbrush is the train!  Please watch our video, before reading further, thank you.  THE STORYOur vision is for Brush Effects to become a global leader in oral care innovation, lead by a revolutionary redesign of the toothbrush that will radically change the way consumers think about oral care. Just like products from Apple Inc.  people want their products because they are trend setters and tech leaders, thats who we want to be in the oral care health field and a few major surprises we have planned, for products to come. We want to bring to market products that are true game changers. With Brush  Effects this is our 1st salvo we are throwing. Your health is so important to us and we are giving you one of the most innovative toothbrushes ever.At Brush Effects, we want to see families out having fun, with big beaming beautiful smiles; not at the dentist with expensive bills, caused by improper oral care. Today's current toothbrush is fine, but the Brush Effects toothbrush is far superior. •Now let's tell you about our amazing Features and BenefitsFeature: Tri Brush Head (TBH) brushes teeth from all sides effectively and does not take up as much room as regular toothbrushes that sit on top of your teeth.Benefit: better and faster cleaning – up to 60% faster than traditional methods.  Feature: Innovative scrapers on sides and back of brush head.Benefit: cleans the sides of the tongue and inner mouth and lips, eliminating harmful bacteria and bacterial gunk build up. These features will ensure a germ free mouth, like never before. Feature: Unique Accordion Flex Sides (AFS) Benefit: fits over any size teeth, adjust from smaller to bigger teeth and back again. Feature: Interlocking BristlesBenefit: better cleaning of the teeth by removing more plaque/gingivitis than a traditional brush, also allows bristles to clean between the teeth more like flossing action. You can also twist your wrist back and forth; this allows the bristles to clean in between teeth, for the first time ever. That's right, flossing action from a toothbrush that brings food particles to the surface, just like flossing!Feature: Unique Handle Design.  Benefit: allows for far better control than any traditional toothbrush, ergonomically designed to fit in the palm of your hand comfortably.The Green Effect•The unique design of our toothbrush allows for faster brushing than ever before. This in turn leads to less water wastage by children especially, who unsupervised, often run the tap non-stop while brushing their teeth. There are also many adults who brush their teeth with the water running. The Brush Effects toothbrush allows for 60% faster brushing than today's current toothbrush. That's 60% less water wasted! A huge benefit in today's Earth-conscious world.   We did a side-by-side comparison of our Brush Effects toothbrush and today's current toothbrush, with both running the tap the entire time while brushing. In this test, a user using today's current toothbrush used a full sink and a half of water while brushing their teeth. With the Brush Effects toothbrush, which allows 60% faster brushing time, these water users used only half a sink of water while brushing. Now add that up amongst all those adults and kids who run water while brushing around the world (DAILY THAT IS). We are really helping Mother Nature out by conserving our precious and limited water resources. The old way above, you had to be a contorshnist to brush your teeth, this way, that way, this way, that way, this way, that way - it's no wonder kids hate brushing there teeth -ummmm us adults too. Let's Talk about the MarketsFor Brush Effects, Initially, we have identified eight key markets that we will target with multi-tiered products tailored specifically for each of them:•Professionals - Travellers•Military•Retail consumer market•Licensee line•Dental professional market•Hospitals, retirement homes and care homes•Pets•Denture MarketBy focusing on the above markets as discrete opportunities we will ensure our sales and marketing efforts resist redundancy, maintain high degrees of measurability and accountability and allow us to be agile and fluid in our efforts to develop the Brush Effects brand.The Industry for Dentures and Care Homes For those who have limited mobility or for caregivers who have to brush the teeth of their patients, Brush Effects will make brushing their teeth far easier than ever before.Caregivers will love that they can brush their patients' teeth in half the time by reaching all 3 sides at once. Now they will have more time to do other things; all of which are important to their day and all the while giving exceptional care - day in and day out..The Brush Effects toothbrush will also help seniors and denture wearers in a huge way. Brush Effects will help denture wearers clean dentures easier and faster than ever before, with little effort.Imagine the big smiles caregivers and patients will share everyday when it comes to brushing Teeth with Brush Effects toothbrush Tech.Military - Let's talk militaryIt's like this most of the time for Military Personnel - whenever and wherever they can- they take care of their oral care health in the most extreme times and on the go. Soldiers are busy and often work in extremely stressful environments. It is a difficult lifestyle and we appreciate their service and sacrifice. We wanted to give them a truly spectacular tool that would help make their tours more comfortable and that much easier. And that's where the Brush Effects Toothbrush comes in.

It's up to us to maintain his teeth and make sure his breath is always fresh. With the Brush Effects Toothbrush we just made it that much easier.(Names - Colors - Design language differences/changes may be made here)• Let's Talk Pets- MARKET ANALYSIS - PETS  OverviewDental disease, or periodontitis, is the number one oral disease in dogs and cats. Over 95% of all dogs and cats will get dental disease in their lifetime, usually by age 2-3 it has significantly started. Periodontitis is an infection of the tooth root, which ultimately results in infected teeth. When periodontal infection starts, these bacteria get into the pet’s circulation system, eventually leading to heart, liver, kidney, bone and joint disease.Approximately 75% of all dog owners and more than 50% of cat owners consider their pet a member of the family. Over 80% of dog owners and 63% of cat owners buy gifts for their pet. Brush Effects will concentrate on this emotional relationship between owners and pets to educate on the importance of oral care and the benefits of Brush Effects products for their pets .Facts & Figures•80% of dogs show periodontal disease by age 3   •those who do purchase oral care products purchase 4-6 oral care products a year, a number that significantly outpaces other pet grooming products.•the global pet care product market is 81 Billion•Americans spent 45.4B on pets in 2009, a 5.1% increase from 2008 and nearly double spent a decade ago.•The pet oral care market is worth over 450M in the US alone.•The global pet oral care market is estimated to be over 4.5B.This shows Pets are a huge part of our families. At Brush Effects our triple brush head will clean all three sides of their teeth easier than ever before. LET'S TALK ABOUT OUR WONDERFUL KIDS.Brushing your children’s teeth can either be a fun activity or a chore. It takes a while before toddlers enjoy brushing.We have all seen this play out- our kids refusing to brush their teeth. Plus they never do it properly. Brush Effects guarantees they brush all sides every single time with minimal effort and done in half the time. Kids usually feel cranky when it’s toothbrushing time. Sometimes it’s the sensation caused by the toothbrush that makes them irritated. Kids have a very limited attention span, getting them to brush their teeth for a full two minutes is truly a battle in itself. The Brush Effects toothbrush will be a new and creative way to make brushing fun for your little ones. You need to start this habit early in order to protect your child’s teeth from cavities and tooth decay.  Make brushing a bonding time. Kids learn mostly by example. When you show them that you also brush your teeth regularly, that gives them something to imitate.You can do some strokes on your child’s teeth then do the same on yours. Brushing together is a great bonding time for you and your kids because you’re experiencing and learning something together.We are very concerned about children's teeth and adults teeth. With your pledge, it will help us focus on a huge goal of ours- to bring the most innovative toothbrush ever - to men, women and children the world over.A DENTAL MISSION DONE BY VOLUNTEERS LIKE JENNY ARE IMPORTANT TO TEACHING AND BRINGING ORAL CARE HEALTH TO CHILDREN ALL OVER THE WORLD. At Brush Effects we want to make sure every mouth in the world gets a chance to experience the future of Oral Care .   Look at this picture below. You can see where cavities mostly start and the progression of them. Today's current toothbrush is fine, but too many times the back of the teeth and in between teeth get neglected. With our Brush Effects Toothbrush, you get SUPERIOR cleaning action from the front, top and back of your teeth with every stroke.  Plaque can also cause an irritation in the gums and result in various gum diseases. In fact, gingivitis is one of the basic gum diseases that is caused by irritated gums. It is basically the crud, germs and plaque in our mouth that result in this gum disease. The initial stages of this gum disease include bleeding, red, swollen and tender gums. The good news is that if diagnosed in the early stages, it is possible to reverse and treat gingivitis. Look at the head on our toothbrush - would you honestly not want to remove as much plaque and germs out your mouth to prevent sickness, cavities, gum disease, and have amazingly fresh breath and clean teeth? Well we are with you in saying yes, that's why we designed Brush Effects with great attention to detail. It is also recommended that a toothbrush should be replaced every three months or the moment the bristles begin to wear out or fray. Thus, brushing our teeth is a simple solution to a lot of health problems and is therefore quite advantageous. Plus you save on those expensive dental bills and days laying in bed sick.Facts & Figures•The global market is over 33 Billion in sales per year •The average American uses 3 toothbrushes/year; there are 315M Americans, resulting in over 900M annual sales •The oral care industry in North America is 9.8 Billion in 2012 and is expected to grow to 10.9 Billion by 2015•Since 2008, the oral care industry in North America has shown a steady 3-5% growth rate annually•Europe has a growth rate of 5-6%/year•India, China, Africa and Brazil are seeing explosive growth in oral care, upwards of 11-14%/year•India and China in particular are facing radical growth as government health programs are pushing oral care to their respective populations; some analysts believe these markets could potentially double in the coming years. For example, only 50% of the Indian and Chinese population is known to use modern oral care products and only 15% brush twice a day. With our Brush Effects Toothbrush Tech, we want to pursue the local Governments around the world and encourage them to make oral care health one of their populations' top priorities.Now, How Are We Going To Get Brush Effects into your Hands?ManufacturingThe professional sourcing company we are partnering with has manufactured many styles of toothbrushes in an extremely high quality manufacturing environment for years.

We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for it's Indiegogo.com campaign reveal. We will do everything in our power to get our toothbrush into production form , from it's current prototype stage. We will do everything in our power to deliver our perks fully, but it is not gauranteed. MANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling/moulds to manufacture any product is 60 to 70 days. It requires expert knowledge to get it right. We are working with a manufacturer who knows their business, and that's making high quality toothbrushes. To minimize the possibility of mistakes and delays we're working with tooling manufacturers/partners with a track record for prompt quality.PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the Brush Effects Toothbrush gets ready for its spotlight there may be some fine tuning of our design and finalizing sizing. Our pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine our design. Products like these give a manufacturer insight into our product design dream and together we will fine tune the manufacturing process for Brush Effects. Any changes will always be for the benefit of you, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.FULFILLMENT: Despite the best planning, there may be factors that we cannot control such as equipment malfunction, transport or supplier delays. While we hope that your support on Indiegogo will enable us to begin production on a commercial scale, we have no idea as to whether it will be 'business as usual' for us or an overwhelming demand. If more people than we anticipate want a Brush Effects Toothbrush, we may have to scale up the factory or set up additional manufacturing in other facilities, or purchase more equipment. We will endeavour to produce the product as quickly as quality will allow. Sometimes things can go wrong that can cause delay. These setbacks will only make us more determined to give our customers the most amazing brushing experience ever. Please join our Brush Effects Facebook page and follow updates.

<div> <h3>The story</h3> <p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Vanuatu was devastated by Cyclone Pam on March 13, with as many as 100,000 people left without food, water, or shelter. Vanuatu Helicopters and explorer Sam Cossman are launching a disaster relief mission to fly supplies to inaccessible villages, and to fly out those most in need of medical help. But we need money for fuel and equipment. Every $4 you can give will help save a life. </span><br/></p>

<h3>The situation in Vanuatu</h3>
<p></p>
<p>International aid efforts are focused on the damage in Port Vila, the nation’s capital, and Tanna, an island in the south east of the Pacific archipelago. But the damage is just as bad if not worse on the much smaller Shepherd Islands leading north from the capital. Not a single village has been left standing over a 100-mile stretch from Pele Island up to Ambrym Island where Sam's volcanic expedition took place mere months ago. As many as 50,000 people have been left without food, water, medical supplies, and shelter. Most of the small boats use to connect the island chain were demolished by the storm. Without natural fresh water or even coconuts left to drink, some have resorted to drinking seawater. On tiny Mataso Island, villagers were cut and killed by corrugated iron sheets ripped from their houses by the wind, and their sea-level houses were completely destroyed by the waves. The situation elsewhere is still being evaluated but due to the inaccesbility of the islands, the death toll is still unknown.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our team</h3>
<p>Vanuatu Helicopters (<a href=""http://www.vanuatuhelicopters.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.vanuatuhelicopters.com</a>) pilots Ben Clark and Andy Martin operate the only Helicopter operation in the country and have a combined 10 years flying experience in the entire archipelago. Explorer and viral video producer, Sam Cossman (<a href=""http://www.samcossman.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.samcossman.com</a>) who visited the Shepherd Islands on two recent expeditions to one of the world's most active volcanoes on Ambrym Island documented this verdant paradise prior to its complete annhilation (as seen in the attached video).   Given the teams knowledge of the surrounding area, existing relationships with tribal leaders and government officials, access to high profile resources like the only Medivac-helicopters and super yachts in the country,  it's up to us to make a difference.  We are collaborating with the owners of Umbra, a super yacht equipped with both a helipad and desalination plant (which can produce 4,000 gallons of fresh water per day) and have flown in two additional helicopters from New Zealand to run relief flights into the many remote parts of Vanuatu which have yet to receive any support.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>We just began the operation and now it's up to all of us to keep these flights going. Without continued funds to buy fuel and supplies, this operation will be very short lived, so I'm asking for your help.  Please contribute if you can as there's no donation too small.   There is not a more well assembled, dedicated team in the country to make the kind of impact we are cable of making.....together we will save lives and help the resilient people of Vanuatu rebuild.  <br/><br/>We'd be honored to have you join us and the Ni-Van people in our fight against Cyclone Pam, please donate today! </p>

As many as 50,000 people have been left without food, water, medical supplies, and shelter. Most of the small boats use to connect the island chain were demolished by the storm. Without natural fresh water or even coconuts left to drink, some have resorted to drinking seawater. On tiny Mataso Island, villagers were cut and killed by corrugated iron sheets ripped from their houses by the wind, and their sea-level houses were completely destroyed by the waves. The situation elsewhere is still being evaluated but due to the inaccesbility of the islands, the death toll is still unknown.

Our team
Vanuatu Helicopters (www.vanuatuhelicopters.com) pilots Ben Clark and Andy Martin operate the only Helicopter operation in the country and have a combined 10 years flying experience in the entire archipelago. Explorer and viral video producer, Sam Cossman (www.samcossman.com) who visited the Shepherd Islands on two recent expeditions to one of the world's most active volcanoes on Ambrym Island documented this verdant paradise prior to its complete annhilation (as seen in the attached video).   Given the teams knowledge of the surrounding area, existing relationships with tribal leaders and government officials, access to high profile resources like the only Medivac-helicopters and super yachts in the country,  it's up to us to make a difference.  We are collaborating with the owners of Umbra, a super yacht equipped with both a helipad and desalination plant (which can produce 4,000 gallons of fresh water per day) and have flown in two additional helicopters from New Zealand to run relief flights into the many remote parts of Vanuatu which have yet to receive any support.

What we need
We just began the operation and now it's up to all of us to keep these flights going. Without continued funds to buy fuel and supplies, this operation will be very short lived, so I'm asking for your help.  Please contribute if you can as there's no donation too small.   There is not a more well assembled, dedicated team in the country to make the kind of impact we are cable of making.....together we will save lives and help the resilient people of Vanuatu rebuild.  We'd be honored to have you join us and the Ni-Van people in our fight against Cyclone Pam, please donate today!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

the Medlink Data SAAS by healthcare providers which make the Wellness Portal
even more valuable to YOU.  One approach is to seed the market with the Wellness
Portal that will create a pull effect.  We believe we will be successful because we have been able to obtain over <strong>2000 views a day</strong>, so once the FREE Wellness Portal is available the adoption rate should be high.  We also intend to market to
smaller practices who can provide the Wellness Portal as a service to their
patients, attracting more patients into their practices by providing
value.  We have experience with launching client building campaigns
 for small practices and have seen great
success.  We plan to take a similar approach. </p><p>Our current pro formas indicate we
have a high risk of becoming cash flow negative by year two.  Our
investments will be used wisely. Our team is willing to put in extra effort and
hours to successfully launch a beta version of the product by the end of this
year.</p>
<p>Given our extensive experience with product development we
understand that throughout the process we may experience unperceived or unplanned
risks along the way, we have planned some contingencies into our schedule to
allow time for investigation and mitigation.  </p>

<p><b>FAQs</b></p>
<p><b>I have a concern over the
confidentiality of my data.</b></p>
<p>We all do, our data is private and
should be treated as such.  The Wellness Portal allows you to keep your
medical history outside of the cloud within your local storage.  You only
post your medical information to the cloud when you need to provide the information
to a specific provider or if you are comfortable hosting your data within the
cloud.  No one else will have access to your data unless you authorize
it.  Your data is secure and encrypted and you own the encryption key.</p>
<p><b>Do I have to share all my data?</b></p>
<p>No, you own your medical data. 
Your data is personal to you.  The Wellness Portal mobile app will allow
you to choose who you send data to, under what conditions and how much. 
For instance you can choose to share only your dental history with your dentist
while keeping the rest of your medical history private. <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432184356/bdefcs3vlo7xbpmmapw6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432184155/ocga5ezknxob5jmve8vl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

We need YOUR help to bring this goal
into a reality with just $25.  

We understand technology.  We understand the market.  We understand YOUR needs.  We have the passion to bring healthcare management to YOU, in ONE simple, easy to use app.


The Wellness Portal enables complete
integration with medical information from tests, devices, labs and 
prescriptions.  It’s a complete solution that enables YOU to be in control of
YOUR medical information.  The Wellness Portal is not affiliated or owned
by any specific healthcare institution so it's interoperable with any system,
which gives you the freedom to change providers without losing valuable
information.

The Wellness Portal synchronizes
your personal calendar with your selected provider.  Make appointments on the fly or triggered
from wellness reminders and automatically
coordinate with your provider with a push of a button.  There
is no need to call, miss appointments or to reschedule your previous
engagements.

The Wellness Portal has an easy to use demographics screen
that has all the information and questions you would typically be
required to provide to a provider for a variety of healthcare specialties.  






The Wellness Portal allows you to
share information YOU chose to a given provider.  This feature allows you
to automatically provide new patient information in advance of your appointment
or in case of an emergency, alleviating waiting room time and unnecessary
paperwork.  This feature also allows a referral office to automatically
receive your information so you are able to get the best and most affordable
health coverage.    




The Wellness Portal enables you to view, store and retrieve your
lab and exam results just as the physician would.  The medical device and EMR plug-ins enable
your test result data to be converted to a known format that can be sent
directly to your Wellness Portal app via the cloud.  Increase confidence in your care and save
time and money by having YOUR test results in your hands once they are ready.  YOU no longer have to wait for your results.  You no longer have to retest when past
results are lost.  Help us bring FREE Patient Centric Care into a reality with your generous contributions.  We have over 17,000 views so far,  but in order to bring this FREE product to the market we rely on your contributions for development and marketing.  Please also spread the word by sharing this Indiegogo campaign with your friends, family and colleagues. Simply click on any of the Facebook, Twitter or other icons below. 



Our team has dedicated their careers to improving healthcare by increasing efficiencies.  We understand the GAPS in the market and believe we have the solution and the right motivation to make a monumental shift in patient care.Shawnnah brings over 15 years of
product development experience in the medical device industry and has spent a
significant amount of time focused on connectivity solutions, specifically in
software.  She can CODE.  Jesse brings over 10 years designing and developing applications for healthcare, education, and research. He can ARCHITECT & DESIGN.Jessica brings over 11 years of business development in the IT industry.  She can effectively engage and influence customers to create opportunities for long-term value.  She can SELL.We have recently completed the
concept phase which included:


customer use cases
product requirements
high level architecture
wireframes
development tools 
platforms supported
performance criteria

We are currently in the prototyping
phase and have implemented a workflow to send and receive data from the medical
device and EMR to the cloud.  Our next step is to develop the mobile
application to connect to the cloud and push and pull patient data to
YOU.  Funds will be used to mature the prototype and launch the mobile
app.
A complete set of wireframes have
been drafted, these are now being digitized.
Prototype and validate workflow with real users such
as yourself.

In addition to the Wellness Portal, Motaic Solutions will develop Medlink, a suite of software along with a software development kit targeted at medical device manufactures and EMR companies enabling physicians to easily connect with their patients from ANYWHERE at ANYTIME.Complete architecture has been
drafted and the Device Driver and Server have been prototyped. 
                           Prototype complete workflow. 
Phase 1 is complete! Phase 2 has already started! Help US
continue our momentum.
Our goal is to raise $600,000 in
order to develop and market  first release of the product .  Our team
is very technically savvy and can guide and contribute to the
development.  Amongst us we have launched over 10 complex software
products from medical devices, clinical applications to EMR.  We know the
INDUSTRY.  We know SOFTWARE.  We believe client feedback is
essential, thus our perks enable you to be part of the development team and help shape the future of healthcare.

We are VERY passionate about our
idea and are dedicated to turning our dream into a reality, but we cannot do this without your contributions.  You can check our progress on www.motaic.com.
                              Every 10 days we will unlock a new feature.
Our biggest risk is adoption rate of
the Medlink Data SAAS by healthcare providers which make the Wellness Portal
even more valuable to YOU.  One approach is to seed the market with the Wellness
Portal that will create a pull effect.  We believe we will be successful because we have been able to obtain over 2000 views a day, so once the FREE Wellness Portal is available the adoption rate should be high.  We also intend to market to
smaller practices who can provide the Wellness Portal as a service to their
patients, attracting more patients into their practices by providing
value.  We have experience with launching client building campaigns
 for small practices and have seen great
success.  We plan to take a similar approach. Our current pro formas indicate we
have a high risk of becoming cash flow negative by year two.  Our
investments will be used wisely. Our team is willing to put in extra effort and
hours to successfully launch a beta version of the product by the end of this
year.
Given our extensive experience with product development we
understand that throughout the process we may experience unperceived or unplanned
risks along the way, we have planned some contingencies into our schedule to
allow time for investigation and mitigation.  


FAQs
I have a concern over the
confidentiality of my data.
We all do, our data is private and
should be treated as such.  The Wellness Portal allows you to keep your
medical history outside of the cloud within your local storage.  You only
post your medical information to the cloud when you need to provide the information
to a specific provider or if you are comfortable hosting your data within the
cloud.  No one else will have access to your data unless you authorize
it.  Your data is secure and encrypted and you own the encryption key.
Do I have to share all my data?
No, you own your medical data. 
Your data is personal to you.  The Wellness Portal mobile app will allow
you to choose who you send data to, under what conditions and how much. 
For instance you can choose to share only your dental history with your dentist
while keeping the rest of your medical history private.",38.0,0,"1 Campaign

Come join us!</i></strong></p><p><strong>Background and Significance</strong></p><p>The shark is a member of the Elasmobranch subclass of fish that includes the ratfish (Chimaera monstrosa). Nearly all species of sharks are known to have an extraordinary resistance to the growth of tumors and infections (1,2). Many investigations have indicated an extremely low incidence of cancer in sharks or even that no cases of cancer in sharks have been recorded (1,2). The emerging hypothesis is that n-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and other shark liver oil (SLO) components may exert anti-carcinogenic effects (3). SLO contains both alkylglycerols (AKG) and squalene that are anti-carcinogenic and anti-bacterial agents and have been used as an ancient remedy among the fishermen along the west coast of Norway and Sweden. It has been used for wound healing, the treatment of irritations of the respiratory and alimentary tracts and lymphadenopathy. Alkylglycerols have been in use in northern Europe for more than 50 years to assist with the prevention and treatment of cancer. They are also in widespread European use to help the immune system function more efficiently to combat infection and respiratory ailments such as asthma. New science is extending the use of this novel nutrient into the realm of anti-aging, especially for immune cells and the cardiovascular system. It has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and can contribute to cell membrane function in ways that help cells regulate health more efficiently – the opposite of the trend of aging.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469995692/mjofqnqafqt7hembjvsf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469996043/jboeukr3pavdylr7c7ps.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The Chimaeras are a very primitive group of fish, with skeletons composed of cartilage instead of bone, dating back for more than 300 million years. They are true survivors from before the dinosaurs, and have changed very little since. They may actually be the oldest and most enigmatic groups of fishes alive today. The ratfish is an extraordinary fish found in all the world's oceans, close to the bottom, at depths of 300–500 meters, with a reported maximum depth of 1,663 meters. These fish are almost half shark and half ray, with smooth skin, big sparkling green eyes designed to see in the dark depths, a rabbit-like face, and a small mouth surrounded by large lips. The nose of the ratfish is studded with electric sensors able to detect the faint electrical signals given off whenever bottom dwelling prey – including crabs, snails, starfish, marine worms, urchins, clams, shrimp, and small fish – use their muscles, and sensitive enough to detect their heartbeats. Their bodies taper to an exceptionally long threadlike tail, and together with their rodent-like teeth designed for crushing the shells of their prey, has earned them the common name “ratfish.”</p><p><strong>Ratfish (<i>Chimaera monstrosa</i>) Distribution </strong></p><p>Distributed in Eastern Atlantic, mostly in Northern Norway and Iceland, Skagerrak and Kattegat south to Morocco including western Mediterranean (some isolated records from eastern part), Azores and Madeira Islands.

Codfish liver oil was used for the maintenance of general health, particularly during the cold months. These months are characterised by low sunlight intensity and an increased risk of hypovitaminosis D (vitamin D deficiency). Such a deficiency can have tragic consequences in light of the fact that vitamin D has been shown to play very important roles in brain, heart, immune system and bone health. Unlike codfish, Chimaeras are mainly confined to the very deep waters and as such were not in plentiful supply for the Vikings, who considered the oil from their liver to be a rare and precious gift from the sea, naming it ‘Gold of the Ocean’. The ancient Norse Vikings and fishermen were well-versed in isolating liver oils and used two very rare, and largely unknown, methods. They had a deep understanding of nature, since they lived in the wild, and both methods were based on nature’s principles. The fish liver must have a specific appearance and come from a fish of a specific age otherwise it was never used for the production of liver oil. You can also see at the bottom right hand side of the image a ceramic knife. We never use metal to manipulate the livers because of fear of oxidation which can adversely affect the final quality of the product.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469989538/aenhxhvjoh17dhx7uekf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Figure 2.</strong> The picture shows a team member is removing a fish liver by use of 'ceramic' knife.</p><p>The quality of fish liver oil is highly dependent on the quality of the liver just like the quality of olive oil is dependent on the quality of the olives. A fresh ratfish and codfish liver is pale with an almost cream-coloured appearance. It should also be beautifully plump and very soft to the touch. Ideally, the rendering process should begin immediately following the removal of the fresh livers and at least before putrefaction has commenced. This results in the lightest coloured oil. The process used to capture the oil was remarkably simple and probably has its origins in ancient time. The Ancient Nordic people observed that fish livers vary in appearance, size and texture depending on the seasons etc. The raw oil naturally separates from the livers without any intervention. This can be done by allowing fresh fish livers to freeze in the cold weather and then moving them to a room which is at the temperature of the Norwegian summer months, the livers will begin to thaw and at the same time the raw liver oil naturally separates from the livers. This ancient method based on nature’s principles captures &amp; preserves the freshness, nutrients and health benefits of the oil. The nutritional content of an oil produced using this age-old method is identical to what you would find in the liver oil of a ‘living’ wild codfish. We make no attempt to alter the nutrient levels. Nature dictates the nutrient levels in our oils. That is how it was created by ancient Nordics and that is how it should always be.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469989579/dblbo9adzpjmrsy5mljy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Figure 3.</strong> The oil separates from the liver without any manipulation.</p><p>The other rare method employed by the Norse Vikings, and used on special occasions, involved the whole fish. This method eliminates the need to remove the livers. The ancient Norse Vikings would simply hang a ratfish up by its long tail, and after a period of time the liver oil would start to drip from the end of its nose. After a certain amount of time has elapsed, oil from its large oily liver will then begin to accumulate around its nose. The picture below shows this. The oil is remarkably clear, pale-coloured and sweet smelling.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469991993/ta3u1uclfelmd0quhdo7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>    </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469992086/arohse6ppkti6vbdfeid.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Figure 4. </strong>After a certain amount of time, oil from its large oily liver begins to accumulate around its nose.</p><p>The oil would then begin to drip and can be collected. The oil produced using this method is held in particular with high regard by the ancient Nordic people and Norse Vikings believed it to be extremely powerful, not only containing the therapeutic elements present in the liver but also those from other organs of the fish as well. Its use was therefore reserved for special occasions.</p><p><strong>An Ancient Remedy Used by the Norwegian Vikings </strong></p><p>The ancient Vikings and Scandinavian fishermen considered the oil derived from the large oily liver of the ratfish as a precious gift from the sea. They used this rare oil for maintaining general health as well as for specific purposes, including wound healing and the treatment of general debility, infections, irritations of the respiratory and alimentary tracts, and glandular disease. It was also applied topically to decrease inflammation and pain, to promote the healing of wounds, and as a skin elixir. The liver of the ratfish is very large, constituting approximately 60% of its total body weight, and contains an exceedingly high proportion of oil. Ratfish liver oil (RLO) is one of the finest antioxidant lubricants known, having been used for guns and fine delicate instruments. Some fishermen used ratfish liver oil as a lubricant and rust preventer. Its characteristics in common with Sperm whale oil, which was used as a lubricant for the finest pocket watches.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469992269/smytnvlcl9dwkpk5vffh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Alkylglycerols (AKGs) have been used in Northern Europe for more than half a century to assist with the prevention and treatment of cancer, a disease that hijacks biological processes and uses them to its own advantage. The human body has developed many strategies to use nutrition to help combat this problem, often means that healthy cells can use a nutrient to enhance their wellbeing while the very same nutrient can help to kill cancer cells. This is a common mechanism with many nutrients such as tocotrienol E, quercetin, curcumin, green tea, and DHA.</p><p>We now know that AKGs can readily accumulate in cell membranes, naturally binding to the membrane lipids. Human cells can use AKGs for healthy purposes including cell signaling and antioxidant defense. Cancer cells appear to have genuine and serious problems with AKGs, which are ether lipids that are abundant in the liver of some Elasmobranch fish species such as the ratfish and certain sharks. AKG are one of the most abundant compounds in RLO. These ether lipids are plentiful in the liver of some elasmobranch fish species such as ratfishes and some sharks. Shark liver oil from Centrophorus squamosus (SLO), or alkyl-Gro mix from this source, have several in vivo biological activities including stimulation of hematopoiesis and immunological defenses (4), sperm quality improvement, or anti-tumor and anti-metastasis activities. Several mechanisms are suggested for these multiple activities, resulting from incorporation of alkyl-Gro into membrane phospholipids, and lipid signaling interactions. Natural alkyl-Gro mix from SLO contains several alkyl-Gro, varying by chain length and unsaturation. Six prominent constituents of natural alkyl-Gro mix, namely 12:0, 14:0, 16:0, 18:0, 16:1 n-7, and 18:1 n-9 alkyl-Gro, were synthesized and tested for anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities on a model of grafted tumor in mice (3LL cells) (4,5). 16:1 and 18:1 AKG showed strong activity in reducing lung metastasis number, while saturated AKG had weaker (16:0) or no (12:0, 14:0, 18:0) effect.

Come join us!Background and SignificanceThe shark is a member of the Elasmobranch subclass of fish that includes the ratfish (Chimaera monstrosa). Nearly all species of sharks are known to have an extraordinary resistance to the growth of tumors and infections (1,2). Many investigations have indicated an extremely low incidence of cancer in sharks or even that no cases of cancer in sharks have been recorded (1,2). The emerging hypothesis is that n-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and other shark liver oil (SLO) components may exert anti-carcinogenic effects (3). SLO contains both alkylglycerols (AKG) and squalene that are anti-carcinogenic and anti-bacterial agents and have been used as an ancient remedy among the fishermen along the west coast of Norway and Sweden. It has been used for wound healing, the treatment of irritations of the respiratory and alimentary tracts and lymphadenopathy. Alkylglycerols have been in use in northern Europe for more than 50 years to assist with the prevention and treatment of cancer. They are also in widespread European use to help the immune system function more efficiently to combat infection and respiratory ailments such as asthma. New science is extending the use of this novel nutrient into the realm of anti-aging, especially for immune cells and the cardiovascular system. It has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and can contribute to cell membrane function in ways that help cells regulate health more efficiently – the opposite of the trend of aging.         The Chimaeras are a very primitive group of fish, with skeletons composed of cartilage instead of bone, dating back for more than 300 million years. They are true survivors from before the dinosaurs, and have changed very little since. They may actually be the oldest and most enigmatic groups of fishes alive today. The ratfish is an extraordinary fish found in all the world's oceans, close to the bottom, at depths of 300–500 meters, with a reported maximum depth of 1,663 meters. These fish are almost half shark and half ray, with smooth skin, big sparkling green eyes designed to see in the dark depths, a rabbit-like face, and a small mouth surrounded by large lips. The nose of the ratfish is studded with electric sensors able to detect the faint electrical signals given off whenever bottom dwelling prey – including crabs, snails, starfish, marine worms, urchins, clams, shrimp, and small fish – use their muscles, and sensitive enough to detect their heartbeats. Their bodies taper to an exceptionally long threadlike tail, and together with their rodent-like teeth designed for crushing the shells of their prey, has earned them the common name “ratfish.”Ratfish (Chimaera monstrosa) Distribution Distributed in Eastern Atlantic, mostly in Northern Norway and Iceland, Skagerrak and Kattegat south to Morocco including western Mediterranean (some isolated records from eastern part), Azores and Madeira Islands. Records from South Africa are questionable. Reported from Oshima, Japan.Figure 1. The red areas on the map show the distribution of Ratfish (Chimaera monstrosa).    Extraction of Liver Oil The ancient Norse Vikings were consumers of liver oils, in particular codfish liver oil, Chimaera monstrosa (ratfish) liver oil, and shark liver oils. Codfish liver oil was used for the maintenance of general health, particularly during the cold months. These months are characterised by low sunlight intensity and an increased risk of hypovitaminosis D (vitamin D deficiency). Such a deficiency can have tragic consequences in light of the fact that vitamin D has been shown to play very important roles in brain, heart, immune system and bone health. Unlike codfish, Chimaeras are mainly confined to the very deep waters and as such were not in plentiful supply for the Vikings, who considered the oil from their liver to be a rare and precious gift from the sea, naming it ‘Gold of the Ocean’. The ancient Norse Vikings and fishermen were well-versed in isolating liver oils and used two very rare, and largely unknown, methods. They had a deep understanding of nature, since they lived in the wild, and both methods were based on nature’s principles. The fish liver must have a specific appearance and come from a fish of a specific age otherwise it was never used for the production of liver oil. You can also see at the bottom right hand side of the image a ceramic knife. We never use metal to manipulate the livers because of fear of oxidation which can adversely affect the final quality of the product.Figure 2. The picture shows a team member is removing a fish liver by use of 'ceramic' knife.The quality of fish liver oil is highly dependent on the quality of the liver just like the quality of olive oil is dependent on the quality of the olives. A fresh ratfish and codfish liver is pale with an almost cream-coloured appearance. It should also be beautifully plump and very soft to the touch. Ideally, the rendering process should begin immediately following the removal of the fresh livers and at least before putrefaction has commenced. This results in the lightest coloured oil. The process used to capture the oil was remarkably simple and probably has its origins in ancient time. The Ancient Nordic people observed that fish livers vary in appearance, size and texture depending on the seasons etc. The raw oil naturally separates from the livers without any intervention. This can be done by allowing fresh fish livers to freeze in the cold weather and then moving them to a room which is at the temperature of the Norwegian summer months, the livers will begin to thaw and at the same time the raw liver oil naturally separates from the livers. This ancient method based on nature’s principles captures & preserves the freshness, nutrients and health benefits of the oil. The nutritional content of an oil produced using this age-old method is identical to what you would find in the liver oil of a ‘living’ wild codfish. We make no attempt to alter the nutrient levels. Nature dictates the nutrient levels in our oils. That is how it was created by ancient Nordics and that is how it should always be.Figure 3. The oil separates from the liver without any manipulation.The other rare method employed by the Norse Vikings, and used on special occasions, involved the whole fish. This method eliminates the need to remove the livers. The ancient Norse Vikings would simply hang a ratfish up by its long tail, and after a period of time the liver oil would start to drip from the end of its nose. After a certain amount of time has elapsed, oil from its large oily liver will then begin to accumulate around its nose. The picture below shows this. The oil is remarkably clear, pale-coloured and sweet smelling.    Figure 4. After a certain amount of time, oil from its large oily liver begins to accumulate around its nose.The oil would then begin to drip and can be collected. The oil produced using this method is held in particular with high regard by the ancient Nordic people and Norse Vikings believed it to be extremely powerful, not only containing the therapeutic elements present in the liver but also those from other organs of the fish as well. Its use was therefore reserved for special occasions.An Ancient Remedy Used by the Norwegian Vikings The ancient Vikings and Scandinavian fishermen considered the oil derived from the large oily liver of the ratfish as a precious gift from the sea. They used this rare oil for maintaining general health as well as for specific purposes, including wound healing and the treatment of general debility, infections, irritations of the respiratory and alimentary tracts, and glandular disease. It was also applied topically to decrease inflammation and pain, to promote the healing of wounds, and as a skin elixir. The liver of the ratfish is very large, constituting approximately 60% of its total body weight, and contains an exceedingly high proportion of oil. Ratfish liver oil (RLO) is one of the finest antioxidant lubricants known, having been used for guns and fine delicate instruments. Some fishermen used ratfish liver oil as a lubricant and rust preventer. Its characteristics in common with Sperm whale oil, which was used as a lubricant for the finest pocket watches.Alkylglycerols (AKGs) have been used in Northern Europe for more than half a century to assist with the prevention and treatment of cancer, a disease that hijacks biological processes and uses them to its own advantage. The human body has developed many strategies to use nutrition to help combat this problem, often means that healthy cells can use a nutrient to enhance their wellbeing while the very same nutrient can help to kill cancer cells. This is a common mechanism with many nutrients such as tocotrienol E, quercetin, curcumin, green tea, and DHA.We now know that AKGs can readily accumulate in cell membranes, naturally binding to the membrane lipids. Human cells can use AKGs for healthy purposes including cell signaling and antioxidant defense. Cancer cells appear to have genuine and serious problems with AKGs, which are ether lipids that are abundant in the liver of some Elasmobranch fish species such as the ratfish and certain sharks. AKG are one of the most abundant compounds in RLO. These ether lipids are plentiful in the liver of some elasmobranch fish species such as ratfishes and some sharks. Shark liver oil from Centrophorus squamosus (SLO), or alkyl-Gro mix from this source, have several in vivo biological activities including stimulation of hematopoiesis and immunological defenses (4), sperm quality improvement, or anti-tumor and anti-metastasis activities. Several mechanisms are suggested for these multiple activities, resulting from incorporation of alkyl-Gro into membrane phospholipids, and lipid signaling interactions. Natural alkyl-Gro mix from SLO contains several alkyl-Gro, varying by chain length and unsaturation. Six prominent constituents of natural alkyl-Gro mix, namely 12:0, 14:0, 16:0, 18:0, 16:1 n-7, and 18:1 n-9 alkyl-Gro, were synthesized and tested for anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities on a model of grafted tumor in mice (3LL cells) (4,5). 16:1 and 18:1 AKG showed strong activity in reducing lung metastasis number, while saturated AKG had weaker (16:0) or no (12:0, 14:0, 18:0) effect. Multiple compounds and mechanisms are probably involved in the multiple activities of natural AKG (4,5).Key Nutritional Features of Ratfish Liver Oil (RLO)I. Ratfish Liver Oil contains Fat-Soluble Vitamins (A, D3 and E), Phytosterols (campesterol, stigmasterol and ∆5-avenasterol) and a wide spectrum of naturally occurring Fatty Acids (omegas 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, & 11).II. The long-chain omega-3s (EPA and DHA) - which come mainly from fish and seafood (particularly fatty fish) – are essential fats meaning that the body cannot make them from scratch but must get them from food.III. Omega-3s support healthy brain, eye, and immune system function. EPA and DHA contribute to the normal function of the heart, help keep blood pressure in the healthy range, and support flexible joints.IV. In the fetus and in breastfed infants DHA contributes to normal brain and eye development. Besides these nutrients, Ratfish Liver Oil has been found to contain exceptionally high amounts of biologically active lipids (fatty substances) called “Alkylglycerols” making it very different from other fish liver oils.What are the Sentiments Behind This Campaign?We all love fish and essential oils. We need using them and studying them. The purpose of this fundraising campaign is to support the project that is designed to confirm the anti-cancer activity of RLO and its underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. In addition to previous and current studies, the testimonials of our clients have revealed multi benefits of RLO.

GAPDH was used as internal standard in this RT-PCR analysis and the data were expressed as relative expression of each gene by use of GAPDH as control (Table 1). In next step we will analyse the corresponding protein synthesis by use of western blot.RT-PCR data showed that RLO induced the expression of p53, p21, p14Arf, Dmp1 and caspase 3 in MCF-7 cells. In contrast Her2 expression was inhibited by this oil and Ras activation did not show any significant changes. In MCF10A (normal cells) only Dmp1, p53, p21 and caspac3 were induced at 4mg/ml concentration. The oncogenes do not show significant changes. The data signify the anti-cancer activity of RLO toward MCF-7 cancer cell line. It is noted that RLO is safe at 2 m/ml for normal cells.Table 1. Gene expression pattern of tumor suppressors, apoptotic genes and oncogenes (red columns) after 72-hour exposure of normal human breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) and breast cancer cells (MCF7) to RLO.The boost and controlled manipulation of patients’ immune system by natural products is a highly desirable goal of many clinicians due to their favorable therapeutic results and less side effects and toxicity. Therefore, mechanism of inhibition of tumor growth needs to be studied further in future. More research on the effect of RLO on immune cell subtypes and intracellular signaling events in murine models and humans is necessary to shed light on the exact mechanisms and scope of the effect of this compound. Current findings suggest that this supplement may be used in prophylaxis cases or treatment of disease in immunocompromised patients.Figure 5. The Ras-Jun-Dmp1 pathway.

According to him..</i><p>April 13, 2016, I was invited to attend a conference in Harvard University and It was my first time in USA. I don't have enough money and I wanted to meet local people and explore the real culture in Boston that's why I looked for a host at couchsurfing.org and everything went more than my expectation. I never felt like home just like how Max, Collins, and Chris offered to me. They offered me a free couch to stay during my stay in the USA. I am having a lot of emotional breakdowns in my life during those moments and I am so lucky to meet and have them in my life because they really became a family to me. They really made sure that I will really feel like home and that I can completely just be myself in their beautiful apartment. They even offer all the groceries and foods in their house to me and the other guests, for free! They even make coffee and cook foods for us. Drinking wine on some nights and introducing me to their friends and lots and lots of good and healthy conversations. And they do listen very well. Oops I almost forgot, they even offer their high-tech(well for me) laundry machines(yes I used it) to clean our clothes!</p><p>One of the guests during my stay with them is also from Boston, and she used  couchsurfing.org as well for the reason that she's kicked out in her apartment and have no place to sleep and no food to eat. Imagine how Chris, Max, and Collins help people with different stories? And they already hosted and helped or adopted more than 200 guests all in all. </p><p>It was my first time to get out of Asia and USA is very different from different aspects. The culture, the technology, the advancement and so on. I never met this host(Chris, the one who owns the account in couchsurfing.org) but I didn't feel any bad vibrations or suspicions because I always trust my instincts. When I landed in Boston, Chris is not in their apartment but he gave me instructions on how to get there. After pulling my two 15kg luggages all the way to the apartment, I finally arrived at their beautiful home. I clicked the white door bell, at first I was worried if there will be someone who will open the door for me, and then here's Max, a tall, white, punk man in his 50's opened the door for me and helped me with my luggage. He showed me the room where the couch is, the kitchen, and even gave me the wifi password. He's always saying sorry because he can't accompany me and he's sick as of the moment so he needs to rest in his bedroom but he wants me to feel at home. I thought that he have some hangover from drinking but judgement is really a sin. </p><p>During my whole stay with them, I've learned about Max's life story; I have no definite plan or itinerary in USA and I decided to stay one more night with them, and they have no problem with that. One night, we had a good wine and I can't forget that night because that's my last night of stay in their apartment and Max made my tears over flowing while he's sharing his life story and feelings, bravely. I even lost the other pair of my contact lens because of the overflowing tears that I even didn't notice that it fell out of my eye. Haha! </p><p>I have a very tragic and worth sharing life story as well, I never heard a life story that is worst than mine. Except Max's. He's an orphan who lived in Hawaii but the family who adopted him left him behind and never heard of them again. Imagine, being an orphan is already hard because of the fact that your real parents abandoned you, what more if the family adopted you who made you believe that you will be loved, will abandon you too? It's like a double kill..   I can feel the moment he said that ""I know it's hard but you have to be strong"" and to live without knowing anything on your background that you don't know who you are and where you came from. Until now. And the saddest part is, he have a cancer. Yes. He have a bone cancer, a chronic myeloid leukemia. And he only have few years left, according to his doctor. Imagine you have a cancer but you don't have relatives who will care for you? It's a triple kill now. I can feel the pain when he told us that he have a cancer but he's stocked in Boston but his home is Hawaii where he can swim with the turquoise, but he have no choice but to just live and wait until the cancer gets his life. He doesn't have a relatives(of course), he's single, and he lives in an apartment with Chris and Collins, he gets money from the government because he is sick and he gives contribution for the rent and food. And in that apartment is where they adopt guests like me from all over the world. Apparently, Max wanted to travel once more after his surgery, before the cancer wont allow him to do so. But the problem is, he is stocked in the USA and he needs some funds to travel to Greece. He chose Greece, Athens, because he have some squat and friends there where he could stay. He is selling his bike and tools to fund for his trip and I really wanted to help him because I want to give back the kindness that they gave me. And I thought that crowdfunding is a great platform to share his story to the world and let's help this orphan-cancer victim to travel once more in his life! He only needs 700$ to travel to Greece, but I wanted to invite him to Philippines as well, but going to Philippines will cost  around $2000. Well, going to Philippines is not necessary but if there are many good people out there and can fund for his visit, why not! :) </p><p>I never mention that he doesn't have a family(I mention relatives), because his family is us, his friends. And I hope you, yes you, the one who's reading this right now, will become a family to him too :) Max really have a good heart. He is really an inspiration on how to become BRAVE and STRONG. And he deserves to travel once more in his life :) He deserves to travel and touch and inspire more people's lives that he will meet along the journey. And I'm still hoping and believing that he could still fight and survive cancer. </p></div>","June 14, 2016 Before Max undergoes his surgery""New permanent skin marks"" Max is undergoing so much pain...

</ol><ul>
</ul><p>There are currently in excess of 25,000 fundraising campaigns for patients with Lyme disease to help them pay for their treatment, as Senator Bernie Sanders has commented, ""<em>No 'one in America should have to choose between their medicine and their food, yet millions are having to make that choice everyday</em>"". This is inexcusable and nobody on a global basis should have to make this choice.</p><p><strong>Every single dollar donated can make a difference. For 1/3 of a price of a fancy coffee you can make a direct impact on the future of Lyme Disease. Help us to Help the Lyme Community. All donations will significantly help</strong></p><ul>
</ul><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><div> <p>Diagnostic development is very expensive, but there are few teams developing a test that can actually make a difference.  Any donation would be greatly received and will get us one step closer to releasing these much needed tests.</p> <ul>
<li><div align=""justify"">I can't share the exact science, but it is a method that our team have used successfully before. What is important here is that there are not many other research projects looking specifically at developing a diagnostic for Lyme disease. Also, we are using two different, yet patented methods to minimize the risk of failure and to make success more likely.</div></li>
<li><div align=""justify"">We are  a  specialist team that have the knowledge, determination and skills to get it to the commercial market, where it can be used - there is limited risk as we have the best chance of releasing this to the market this way subject to quality and regulatory approval, which is out of our control.  As someone very wise suggested to me, even failures are ways of moving forward. We have invested heavily in this project and have the commitment and drive to make this work.<br/>
</div></li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As many of the Lyme disease community knows, Lyme disease is a tick borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lyme Disease is the fastest growing infectious bacterial disease in the USA.  It is twice as common as breast cancer and 6 times as common as Aids</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Current Estimates of cases in the US equate to 1m new cases per year with costs the US  healthcare systems between 712m and 1.3b USD per year.  These costs do not include out of pocket expenses which are reported as being in excess of $53,000 per patient and often most families will have more than one family member affected by this deadly disease.  These costs also do not include the additional medical examinations, physician appointments and pharmaceuticals that are dispensed to patients with Lyme disease when they are misdiagnosed with other chronic illnesses such as CFS, Parkinson's AZD, and multiple sclerosis for example, causing further complications as the Lyme disease is missed, the disease becomes chronic and further damage is done.</p>
<ul><li><div style=""text-align: justify;"">Current Estimates of cases in Europe are rapidly reaching six figures, with 1.5 million cases being reported in Germany.</div></li></ul>
<ul><li><div style=""text-align: justify;"">By 2020 due to climate change, 28million people will have been exposed to deer ticks, placing them at a major risk of contracting Lyme disease.</div></li></ul>
<ul><li><div style=""text-align: justify;"">Richard Horowitz, a well respected Lyme medical doctor has reported that the Chinese CDC has indicated that there are 83 million cases of Lyme disease in China.</div></li></ul>
<ul><li><div style=""text-align: justify;"">In Australia, the Griffin University national center for neuroimmunology and emerging disease has indicated that there are at least 460,000 cases of Lyme disease.</div></li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The impact of this disease is astounding, currently the recommended two tiered testing is not effective.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>"" Our development of a urinary Lyme diagnostic test in several formats will facilitate early antibiotic therapy and significantly decrease complications and costs from the Lyme disease infection on a world wide basis""</strong></p> <strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong>
</div><div> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">All scientific projects are risky, but we feel it depends upon how you view risk, it is less risky if we have an opportunity to get these tests to the market, make a difference to the medical and Lyme community, raise further awareness and importantly raise funds so that we can further directly help Lyme patients.  As a Lyme disease sufferer, how would you feel if you could ring or write to a charity and say, ""here's my medical expenses"" and the voice at the end of the phone says ""don't worry, we'll pay those for you""  That's the intention of Flourish - if we can get the tests to market, we'll have the funds to be able to do that.</p> <strong> Other Ways You Can Help</strong>
</div><div> <p>Please just share this campaign, any donation is greatly received and will help us get one step closer to helping where help is needed.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Together we can make a difference</strong>.</p>

</div></div>","Short SummaryIt is suggested that there are roughly up to 100,000,000 people around the globe infected with Borrelia Burgdorferi - the bacterial infection commonly known as Lyme disease.  Despite the rapid increase of cases, funding for Lyme disease research remains irresponsibly low.To date there are no accurate tests for Lyme Disease - Dr.  Daniel Cameron has stated that with current testing methods as many as 50% of patients test negative for Lyme. Helen McCormack from Flourish Partners regularly communicates with many Lyme disease advocacy groups, Lyme literate doctors and patients who have confirmed their need for an accurate diagnostic and what a difference it would make to them and those around them affected by this deadly disease. Some comments that illustrate the impact of no accurate tests being available:-

""If I had received accurate testing, I would not have spent most of my teens and early twenties suffering a myriad of physical problems.  Accurate testing would have saved me from not just the physical trauma of 11 years of deteriorating health when I was supposed to be in the prime of my life, but also the emotional struggle to not lose faith in yourself when others doubt the severity or even existence of your illness"". 
""It would mean less death and pain and suffering - that's my bottom line""

""If there was an accurate diagnostic when I became infected, I would not have an infected child, a broken heart (literally) and lesions all over my body"".

""An accurate and affordable test would transform the experience of the hundreds of people who visit our support group with Lyme symptoms with either negative UK tests or a refusal to test. An accurate affordable test would have the power to transform the whole landscape of Lyme. More people would be treated earlier and avoid serious disease"".

""It would mean validation. The most crushing realization of having Lyme disease is that no one believes you. People leave you and you are left questioning yourself. It is the saddest and most unnecessary result of a Lyme diagnosis. Justification of the disease would validate thousands of people and give them confidence and hope. It would give family members a chance to feel proud of caring for a sick loved one rather than feeling ashamed and embarrassed thinking it's hypochondria. Validation of Lyme disease by accurate diagnostics would also take it to the next level of funding further research and hopefully a cure.""

""An accurate, stable, reliable test is critical.""


""It would be a complete game changer and mean that people could get answers to why they are suffering so much without spending a fortune and still being left in doubt with testing accuracy. It would reduce the stress that comes with not knowing what you are dealing with and the trauma of being mis-diagnosed. ""

There are currently in excess of 25,000 fundraising campaigns for patients with Lyme disease to help them pay for their treatment, as Senator Bernie Sanders has commented, ""No 'one in America should have to choose between their medicine and their food, yet millions are having to make that choice everyday"". This is inexcusable and nobody on a global basis should have to make this choice.Every single dollar donated can make a difference. For 1/3 of a price of a fancy coffee you can make a direct impact on the future of Lyme Disease. Help us to Help the Lyme Community. All donations will significantly help
What We Need & What You Get Diagnostic development is very expensive, but there are few teams developing a test that can actually make a difference.  Any donation would be greatly received and will get us one step closer to releasing these much needed tests. 
I can't share the exact science, but it is a method that our team have used successfully before. What is important here is that there are not many other research projects looking specifically at developing a diagnostic for Lyme disease. Also, we are using two different, yet patented methods to minimize the risk of failure and to make success more likely.
We are  a  specialist team that have the knowledge, determination and skills to get it to the commercial market, where it can be used - there is limited risk as we have the best chance of releasing this to the market this way subject to quality and regulatory approval, which is out of our control.  As someone very wise suggested to me, even failures are ways of moving forward. We have invested heavily in this project and have the commitment and drive to make this work.
    The Impact
As many of the Lyme disease community knows, Lyme disease is a tick borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. 
Lyme Disease is the fastest growing infectious bacterial disease in the USA.  It is twice as common as breast cancer and 6 times as common as Aids
Current Estimates of cases in the US equate to 1m new cases per year with costs the US  healthcare systems between 712m and 1.3b USD per year.  These costs do not include out of pocket expenses which are reported as being in excess of $53,000 per patient and often most families will have more than one family member affected by this deadly disease.  These costs also do not include the additional medical examinations, physician appointments and pharmaceuticals that are dispensed to patients with Lyme disease when they are misdiagnosed with other chronic illnesses such as CFS, Parkinson's AZD, and multiple sclerosis for example, causing further complications as the Lyme disease is missed, the disease becomes chronic and further damage is done.
Current Estimates of cases in Europe are rapidly reaching six figures, with 1.5 million cases being reported in Germany.
By 2020 due to climate change, 28million people will have been exposed to deer ticks, placing them at a major risk of contracting Lyme disease.
Richard Horowitz, a well respected Lyme medical doctor has reported that the Chinese CDC has indicated that there are 83 million cases of Lyme disease in China.
In Australia, the Griffin University national center for neuroimmunology and emerging disease has indicated that there are at least 460,000 cases of Lyme disease.
The impact of this disease is astounding, currently the recommended two tiered testing is not effective.
"" Our development of a urinary Lyme diagnostic test in several formats will facilitate early antibiotic therapy and significantly decrease complications and costs from the Lyme disease infection on a world wide basis"" Risks & Challenges
 All scientific projects are risky, but we feel it depends upon how you view risk, it is less risky if we have an opportunity to get these tests to the market, make a difference to the medical and Lyme community, raise further awareness and importantly raise funds so that we can further directly help Lyme patients.  As a Lyme disease sufferer, how would you feel if you could ring or write to a charity and say, ""here's my medical expenses"" and the voice at the end of the phone says ""don't worry, we'll pay those for you""  That's the intention of Flourish - if we can get the tests to market, we'll have the funds to be able to do that.  Other Ways You Can Help
 Please just share this campaign, any donation is greatly received and will help us get one step closer to helping where help is needed.
Thank you for taking the time to read this campaign.
Together we can make a difference.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>We started Audible Yoga in 2015 with a device-friendly website, but we always knew we would build an app. Current subscribers are already clamoring for it and we'd like to deliver it quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Our goal is to raise just $8,000</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>100% of the funds will be used to pay for this crowdfund and app development</li>
<li>All the features of our website will be there - searching, streaming, downloading, giving feedback</li>
<li>NEW features will be implemented - notifications of new classes, save classes for later, set timers to remind you to practice, and create wish lists!</li>
<li>NEW features for teachers - tracking downloads, upload recordings from your phone, see how many students follow you.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>
<p>Two inspired and dedicated women created Audible Yoga. They wanted to deliver a practical yoga product and make a difference. A yoga retreat and a simple question sparked the inspiration, <i>“What if I could take my favorite yoga teacher home?”</i> Soon, hundreds of international yoga teachers answered the call to record their yoga classes and give students around the world the opportunity to practice more often with their favorite teachers and even reconnect with former teachers.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have a great development team, a working business model, and the passion and drive to make this work. We have over 160 yoga teachers sharing over 1,200 yoga classes now.</p>
<p>We believe we're answering two very real challenges in the yoga industry today:</p>
<ul>
<li>A convenient and affordable daily yoga practice for students</li>
<li>Access to passive income for yoga teachers</li>
</ul>
<div>Our biggest risk right now is not having an app and our challenge is funding.</div>

</div></div>","Why Audible Yoga
Between busy work schedules, family responsibilities and everything that life tosses at us, finding time to get to a yoga class isn't always easy. And yet, you know how a regular yoga practice ripples outward from your mat giving you greater health, more joy, and a better quality of life. 
Yoga doesn't have to stay in the studio. Your teacher can guide your practice anywhere.
Let's make a daily yoga practice CONVENIENT and POSSIBLE.

Helping Yoga Teachers Thrive
To support our yoga teachers with yoga-business training and help them start the new year with a thriving yoga business, we worked with yoga experts to put together the ultimate yoga teacher training package:
 

 
Why We Need Your Help
We started Audible Yoga in 2015 with a device-friendly website, but we always knew we would build an app. Current subscribers are already clamoring for it and we'd like to deliver it quickly.
Our goal is to raise just $8,000

100% of the funds will be used to pay for this crowdfund and app development
All the features of our website will be there - searching, streaming, downloading, giving feedback
NEW features will be implemented - notifications of new classes, save classes for later, set timers to remind you to practice, and create wish lists!
NEW features for teachers - tracking downloads, upload recordings from your phone, see how many students follow you.


 
Our Timeline

What People Are Saying

 

Our Story

Two inspired and dedicated women created Audible Yoga. They wanted to deliver a practical yoga product and make a difference. A yoga retreat and a simple question sparked the inspiration, “What if I could take my favorite yoga teacher home?” Soon, hundreds of international yoga teachers answered the call to record their yoga classes and give students around the world the opportunity to practice more often with their favorite teachers and even reconnect with former teachers.
 

Risks & Challenges
We have a great development team, a working business model, and the passion and drive to make this work. We have over 160 yoga teachers sharing over 1,200 yoga classes now.
We believe we're answering two very real challenges in the yoga industry today:

A convenient and affordable daily yoga practice for students
Access to passive income for yoga teachers

Our biggest risk right now is not having an app and our challenge is funding.

</h1><p><br/></p><h1>Legal California medical cannabis business
recovering from raid, bank accounts frozen</h1><div><i><b>Assets Frozen. We need your help for our legal defense fund so we can fight for the future of the legal cannabis industry in California and America</b></i></div><div>
<p>On January 28, 2016 at
7:30 a.m., approximately 30 officers in body armor, helmets and carrying
automatic weapons, sledgehammered the front door of Med-West, a San
Diego-based company that makes legal cannabis-based medicines for legal
dispensaries in California.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough,
the local news media knew about the raid and splashed the news over the public
airwaves. They reported that the officers had a search warrant for a suspected
“Hash Oil Lab”. Cash was seized. Bank accounts were frozen. Two employees of
Med-West were handcuffed and detained for hours and later arrested. The officers gave each other high fives as they left the building with their haul.</p>
<p>Just another drug
bust?</p>
<p>No. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>Med-West is a legal business, that is highly regulated. Trusted in the cannabis industry and led by a cannabis pioneer who has helped influence national drug policy in multiple states.</p>
<p>James Slatic, a serial entrepreneur and CEO of San
Diego based business Med-West Distribution, LLC, wasn't at the building during the raid and has not been arrested or charged. Slatic created the company to make and sell CO2
extracted medical cannabis products, including vape pens and cartridges. Slatic is part of the movement
that wants to help create a great new American industry, and to stop putting
people in jail for this helpful plant.</p>
<p>He has an
entrepreneurial vision of helping people and raising awareness of the many options of medical cannabis and giving back to be of service
to this new industry. James was a founding member of the National Cannabis
Industry Association, and founding board member of California Cannabis Industry, and
Nevada Cannabis Industry Associations, sits on the Board of Marijuana Policy
Project, and is a regular speaker at industry and activism events for CalNorml
and Drug Policy Alliance.</p>
<p>Med-West medicines are
not the crude products of yesteryear. Rigorous laboratory testing, in a
city-licensed facility, is done throughout to ensure proper potency and
purity. Importantly, Med-West cannabis oil products are produced within strict
adherence to state laws using a CO2 extraction method. And importantly, NO CO2 extraction took place at this facility.</p>
<p>Med-West does not sell
their products to individual patients, only in wholesale to licensed
dispensaries. City officials in San Diego were regular visitors to the 14,000
square-foot facility. Even police officers had stopped by for a visit earlier
in the year. But just a few weeks after a new statewide law, that Slatic helped
write and pass, took effect a local DA preformed a ""smash and grab"" on Med-West, and
somebody called the media.</p>
<p><b>Follow the Money</b></p>
<p>The lives of James,
his wife and daughters and the employees of Med-West changed drastically on
January 28, 2016. </p>
<p>Law enforcement
personnel raided Med-West took everything, in. All the companies products, raw materials, computers, hard
drives, laptops, files, tax and patient records were seized, along with a large
sum of cash due to be used for payroll and product purchases.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of
this raid, 21 employees are now out of work, and patients in the hundreds of
collectives we served were deprived of their medicine.</p>
<p>It appears that money for at least some of the personnel who planned and conducted the raid was paid from federal funds designated for homeland security ... to protect and defend our nation from terrorism.</p>
<p><b>Slatic’s Assets, Even Personal and Family Bank Accounts, Have Been Frozen </b></p>
<p>This includes his wife
and teenage daughters’ accounts as well. His wife, Annette, is a Federal
employee at the VA Hospital in La Jolla, and has nothing to do with the
business. Their daughter is a student at San Jose State, and could not even buy
food at school. According to his bank, this was done with nothing more than a
signed letter from a San Diego police detective. The bank will not provide his
attorneys with a copy of the reported court order, nor will the police or
D.A.’s office.</p>
<p><b style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>A Simple Request</b><br/></p>
<p>Help us fight back by
contributing to the Med-West Legal Defense Fund.</p>
<p>With their assets
frozen, Slatic and his team need funds to pay attorneys, consulting experts, and
others who will help them fight back against this misguided raid.</p>
<p>An escrow account has
been established and fiduciary controls have been put in place to protect the
integrity of the funds raised. The funds will be used to pay attorney’s fees
and for the myriad of expenses that come along with a fight against the
government.</p>
<p>Financial support during this critical time will be deeply appreciated ... some in the industry have already promised to help once this fund is established ... but we would also appreciate small, individual contributions from people who share our belief in the fledgling American cannabis industry.</p>
<p>Truth is on our side. James Slatic and Med-West need those who believe in the American Cannabis industry
to provide them with the financial support they need to win this fight. If this
can happen in San Diego, California … it can happen anywhere.</p>

Legal California medical cannabis business
recovering from raid, bank accounts frozenAssets Frozen. We need your help for our legal defense fund so we can fight for the future of the legal cannabis industry in California and America
On January 28, 2016 at
7:30 a.m., approximately 30 officers in body armor, helmets and carrying
automatic weapons, sledgehammered the front door of Med-West, a San
Diego-based company that makes legal cannabis-based medicines for legal
dispensaries in California.
Interestingly enough,
the local news media knew about the raid and splashed the news over the public
airwaves. They reported that the officers had a search warrant for a suspected
“Hash Oil Lab”. Cash was seized. Bank accounts were frozen. Two employees of
Med-West were handcuffed and detained for hours and later arrested. The officers gave each other high fives as they left the building with their haul.
Just another drug
bust?
No. It wasn’t.
Med-West is a legal business, that is highly regulated. Trusted in the cannabis industry and led by a cannabis pioneer who has helped influence national drug policy in multiple states.
James Slatic, a serial entrepreneur and CEO of San
Diego based business Med-West Distribution, LLC, wasn't at the building during the raid and has not been arrested or charged. Slatic created the company to make and sell CO2
extracted medical cannabis products, including vape pens and cartridges. Slatic is part of the movement
that wants to help create a great new American industry, and to stop putting
people in jail for this helpful plant.
He has an
entrepreneurial vision of helping people and raising awareness of the many options of medical cannabis and giving back to be of service
to this new industry. James was a founding member of the National Cannabis
Industry Association, and founding board member of California Cannabis Industry, and
Nevada Cannabis Industry Associations, sits on the Board of Marijuana Policy
Project, and is a regular speaker at industry and activism events for CalNorml
and Drug Policy Alliance.
Med-West medicines are
not the crude products of yesteryear. Rigorous laboratory testing, in a
city-licensed facility, is done throughout to ensure proper potency and
purity. Importantly, Med-West cannabis oil products are produced within strict
adherence to state laws using a CO2 extraction method. And importantly, NO CO2 extraction took place at this facility.
Med-West does not sell
their products to individual patients, only in wholesale to licensed
dispensaries. City officials in San Diego were regular visitors to the 14,000
square-foot facility. Even police officers had stopped by for a visit earlier
in the year. But just a few weeks after a new statewide law, that Slatic helped
write and pass, took effect a local DA preformed a ""smash and grab"" on Med-West, and
somebody called the media.
Follow the Money
The lives of James,
his wife and daughters and the employees of Med-West changed drastically on
January 28, 2016. 
Law enforcement
personnel raided Med-West took everything, in. All the companies products, raw materials, computers, hard
drives, laptops, files, tax and patient records were seized, along with a large
sum of cash due to be used for payroll and product purchases.
In the aftermath of
this raid, 21 employees are now out of work, and patients in the hundreds of
collectives we served were deprived of their medicine.
It appears that money for at least some of the personnel who planned and conducted the raid was paid from federal funds designated for homeland security ... to protect and defend our nation from terrorism.
Slatic’s Assets, Even Personal and Family Bank Accounts, Have Been Frozen 
This includes his wife
and teenage daughters’ accounts as well. His wife, Annette, is a Federal
employee at the VA Hospital in La Jolla, and has nothing to do with the
business. Their daughter is a student at San Jose State, and could not even buy
food at school. According to his bank, this was done with nothing more than a
signed letter from a San Diego police detective. The bank will not provide his
attorneys with a copy of the reported court order, nor will the police or
D.A.’s office.
A Simple Request
Help us fight back by
contributing to the Med-West Legal Defense Fund.
With their assets
frozen, Slatic and his team need funds to pay attorneys, consulting experts, and
others who will help them fight back against this misguided raid.
An escrow account has
been established and fiduciary controls have been put in place to protect the
integrity of the funds raised. The funds will be used to pay attorney’s fees
and for the myriad of expenses that come along with a fight against the
government.
Financial support during this critical time will be deeply appreciated ... some in the industry have already promised to help once this fund is established ... but we would also appreciate small, individual contributions from people who share our belief in the fledgling American cannabis industry.
Truth is on our side. James Slatic and Med-West need those who believe in the American Cannabis industry
to provide them with the financial support they need to win this fight. If this
can happen in San Diego, California … it can happen anywhere.
What We Need & What You Get
We have the following
available for donors:

80 Silver California coins $1,000
70 Silver Nevada coins $1,000
20 Kayman Bikes™ Flash E-Bike for donors of $5000 
Whatever we raise that is not used we will help others
     in similar situations







All proceeds go to
legal costs, and other fees and costs toward the business opening again to help
patients. Whatever we raise that is not used will go to help others in similar situations They are seeking to open (in a new location) for
patient's care and medicine soon.  For more information, you can search

Nya, (my canine co-therapist) and I thank you!</p>
<p>Even small donations are so helpful!</p>
<p>SE is an innovative, gentle, neurobiologically based therapy that deeply heals by helping the client use their innate protective systems, re-unifying body and mind through the autonomic nervous system. SE, and other trauma healing psychotherapies that include the body, is endorsed by leaders in the field of psychological trauma, including Bessel Van der Kolk, Bruce Perry, Stephen Porges, and Peter Levine (its creator).</p>
<p>Here are some details:</p> <ul> <li>I'm a trauma therapist, Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), and survivor in St. Louis, Missouri. I have a small private practice where I specialize in treating trauma, especially trauma from sexual assault, human trafficking, military service (I'm a veteran), and shock events like car wrecks and other boundary breeches. My great dog, Nya, a Blue Heeler, is my co-therapist (that's her in the picture with me). I have a sliding scale and work hard to serve my community.</li> <li>I'm raising funds to pay for my second year of Somatic Experiencing (SE) training. SE is a gentle method of resolving trauma, healing from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and other mental, emotional, and physical health challenges that are held in the body, and that does not require continually revisiting the traumatic experience. You can find out more about SE here: <a href=""http://www.thewildtherapist.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thewildtherapist.com/se.html</a>
</li> <li>By helping fund my training you will be helping people who have suffered trauma and are stuck in the aftereffects. Many people have PTSD symptoms and haven't even realized it. Then they find that ""positive thinking"" just isn't making them feel better. I  have found that healing trauma holistically, including mind AND body, frees people up to live their lives as they truly wish. I don't want this to be available to only people who have incomes high enough to afford it (or low enough insurance deductables!), so I offer a sliding scale. This sliding scale, though, does limit my income, which makes it hard to pay for the SE training. I paid for all of the first year on my own. Now I need help to enter the second year, so that I can increase my skills and bring them to the people.</li>
<li>In addition to SE I use depth psychology, therapeutic dream work, and have been trained in the cognitive therapies. But recent evidence is showing that the cognitive therapies may not be as effective as previously thought, and my work goes well beyond that and into neurobiologically-sound work (such as SE).</li>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>What Can You Plan Using The App?</b></h4>
<p><b>1. The water fountain:</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">You can activate the water fountain continuously</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">You can activate or deactivate the pump of the fountain at anytime you
want (Example: You want it to be turned off during night because you don’t want
to hear the sound of the water flowing )</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">You can activate it only when the cat is near the Catspad</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We advise to keep the fountain active all the time, because the moving
water will attract your cat and encourage him to drink more, which will keep him healthy and therefore avoid
many health problems.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">To keep the water healthy, the pump should be activated once every 1 hour. So even if you deactivate the fountain, the Catspad's pump will be activated
automatically to replace the water in the bowl with a fresh one.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
</div>
<span><b>2. The kibbles stock:</b></span><p><span>
Catspad
can distribute the kibbles with exact quantities and at specific time during
the day and as much times as you want. Scheduling the meals is as easy as
setting an alarm on your smartphone. You can setup the time, the frequency and
the quantity for the kibbles distribution. (Example: from 7:00 am till 7:00pm,
3 times everyday or just on Sunday, 25 grams each time). You can also schedule meals as much as you want.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<b>3. Supplies notification</b><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/>With the default settings,
Catspad will automatically alert you if the level of supplies is too low (3
days before it gets empty). You can change the alert setting and make it 7 days
before, for example.</span><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">
</span></p>
<p><b>4. What to do if a power outage happens when you are away from home?</b></p>
<p>In
case of power outage, Catspad has a backup battery that can last for one month.
If your internet box doesn’t work and you are no longer connected to Internet,
your Catspad will not be able to send updates to your mobile, though it will
continue to take care of your cat by distributing the kibbles as per the last
schedule setting and activating the water fountain every one hour. The
objective is to keep the main utilities of the machine functioning, which are
the food dispenser and the water fountain. </p>

<p>Catspad is the fruit of trusted friendship between Julie
&amp; Brice, friends from high school. </p>
<p>They went last year on vacation and left Mozart,
Julie’s cat, with a friend who got sick. Sadly, Julie and Brice had to cut their
vacation short in order to return and take care of Mozart. </p>
<p>Brice, an engineer and a big fan of technology, asked himself: « why is there no smart
product that can help us take care of our cat and save our vacations? » </p>
<p>This is when they embarked on their big adventure.</p>
<p>Julie
and Brice decided to adapt connected technology to facilitate the life of

Beside its automated feeding feature, Catspad enables you to check your cat's nutrition and daily consumption rate as well as get notifications when food and water supplies are low using its application on any smartphone!






 Catspad in The News!













""Cat lovers can be closer to their little campanions"" Le Journal du Geek
""Kibbles 3.0"" FrenchWeb
""Very practical especially when you travel"" Stuffi
""Catspad will be a real assistant in your daily life"" Scoop.it
""Taking care of its cat without hands, it is possible!"" Objetconnecte.net





 The Best Feeder Ever! 


















 Why Catspad?




Our expert team of professional designers and technicians
developed Catspad to respect the cats’ nature and answer to cat owners needs.
Its technology and design provide an amazing experience for both, cats and
cats owners. 
1.  Catspad food
dispenser enables you to feed your cats just like the wild typical ones; it has
a small bowl that allows to dispense small amounts of food frequently
throughout the day. Its sealed reservoir conserves kibbles for one month and keeps
them fresh and strong
2.  Catspad water
dispenser makes it attractive for cats; it keeps the water running and fresh and
encourages cats to drink more. The water dispenser includes a filter, which
removes bad tastes and smells annoying for cats.
3.  CATSPAD’s size and format will blend
seamlessly with your home decor. It’s electrically powered, and also equipped
with a battery in case of a power outage.








 How Does it work?

Catspad can be installed in easy steps, all what you have to do is:


Turn on your Catspad
Download Catspad application
Connect your Catspad to your Wi-Fi network (Following the App's instructions)
Identify your cat (Manually, by using a collar or your cat's subcutaneous chip)
Enter your cat's information (Photo, name, age, etc..)

If you have more than one cat, you just have to repeat steps 4, 5 and 6 for each one and you will be able to check each cat's consumption individually.
Stay connected to your cats!






 The Catspad App

With
Catspad, our smart cat feeder, the mobile application and all the services are
totally free. In the first time, the app will be available for iOS and Android.
Windows Phone and Webapp platforms will come shortly after the first releases. Catspad also works for multiple cat profiles per users.





What Can You Plan Using The App?
1. The water fountain:





You can activate the water fountain continuously


You can activate or deactivate the pump of the fountain at anytime you
want (Example: You want it to be turned off during night because you don’t want
to hear the sound of the water flowing )


You can activate it only when the cat is near the Catspad



Notes:



We advise to keep the fountain active all the time, because the moving
water will attract your cat and encourage him to drink more, which will keep him healthy and therefore avoid
many health problems.


To keep the water healthy, the pump should be activated once every 1 hour. So even if you deactivate the fountain, the Catspad's pump will be activated
automatically to replace the water in the bowl with a fresh one.





2. The kibbles stock:
Catspad
can distribute the kibbles with exact quantities and at specific time during
the day and as much times as you want. Scheduling the meals is as easy as
setting an alarm on your smartphone. You can setup the time, the frequency and
the quantity for the kibbles distribution. (Example: from 7:00 am till 7:00pm,
3 times everyday or just on Sunday, 25 grams each time). You can also schedule meals as much as you want.

3. Supplies notificationWith the default settings,
Catspad will automatically alert you if the level of supplies is too low (3
days before it gets empty). You can change the alert setting and make it 7 days
before, for example.


4. What to do if a power outage happens when you are away from home?
In
case of power outage, Catspad has a backup battery that can last for one month.
If your internet box doesn’t work and you are no longer connected to Internet,
your Catspad will not be able to send updates to your mobile, though it will
continue to take care of your cat by distributing the kibbles as per the last
schedule setting and activating the water fountain every one hour. The
objective is to keep the main utilities of the machine functioning, which are
the food dispenser and the water fountain.

 Our Amazing Team






Catspad is the fruit of trusted friendship between Julie
& Brice, friends from high school. 
They went last year on vacation and left Mozart,
Julie’s cat, with a friend who got sick. Sadly, Julie and Brice had to cut their
vacation short in order to return and take care of Mozart. 
Brice, an engineer and a big fan of technology, asked himself: « why is there no smart
product that can help us take care of our cat and save our vacations? » 
This is when they embarked on their big adventure.
Julie
and Brice decided to adapt connected technology to facilitate the life of
cat's owners by creating a new smart dispenser for cats. They decided on asking cat lovers from different sectors to help them develop the project. 
Catspad was born and the
team was created  with Mozart, our everyday inspiration manager!

But I wasn't always the athletic 37 year old you see in the video and I wasn't always a personal trainer or health coach. When I was 28 I was very sick. I didn't eat right or exercise, I smoked and I drank and it took it's toll on my health. I wasn't even 30 yet and I was on blood pressure medication as well as one other pill! </p><p>I decided I needed to change my life so I wouldn't be taking dozens of pills by the time I was 50. I got into running, exercising and eating healthy! I left a stressful job and relationship! I quit smoking and greatly reduced my drinking! And you know what? It worked!  That's when I decided I wanted to help others turn their health around. I became a  personal trainer and later a health coach and I've been helping people for over 5 years now! To this day I have complete 5 full marathons and two Half Ironman distance triathlons. Even my father has made a valiant comeback to running and fitness.</p><p>I want to reach out to more people. I want to provide fitness for people of all ability levels, in any situation at any time. We at Momentum want to build a video and recipe library that you can access at the gym, in a hotel, at home or even in parking lot! And for a very affordable price to our fans. But it has to be good! We have to have good camera equipment, fantastic settings and motivational people to get would be exercisers excited! </p><p>Your contribution can help us get there. It can help us provide affordable, instructor lead workouts that you can do at any time in any situation. What sets us apart from other online fitness sites? For starters you can pick and choose what workouts you do daily. You don't have to be strapped into a 12 week program. We understand that sometimes you are a little sore and may need a different workout that day. You can choose that! We will also have a portal to track all of your goals, action steps and accomplishments and be able to share them in a ""member's only"" online wall.

But I wasn't always the athletic 37 year old you see in the video and I wasn't always a personal trainer or health coach. When I was 28 I was very sick. I didn't eat right or exercise, I smoked and I drank and it took it's toll on my health. I wasn't even 30 yet and I was on blood pressure medication as well as one other pill! I decided I needed to change my life so I wouldn't be taking dozens of pills by the time I was 50. I got into running, exercising and eating healthy! I left a stressful job and relationship! I quit smoking and greatly reduced my drinking! And you know what? It worked!  That's when I decided I wanted to help others turn their health around. I became a  personal trainer and later a health coach and I've been helping people for over 5 years now! To this day I have complete 5 full marathons and two Half Ironman distance triathlons. Even my father has made a valiant comeback to running and fitness.I want to reach out to more people. I want to provide fitness for people of all ability levels, in any situation at any time. We at Momentum want to build a video and recipe library that you can access at the gym, in a hotel, at home or even in parking lot! And for a very affordable price to our fans. But it has to be good! We have to have good camera equipment, fantastic settings and motivational people to get would be exercisers excited! Your contribution can help us get there. It can help us provide affordable, instructor lead workouts that you can do at any time in any situation. What sets us apart from other online fitness sites? For starters you can pick and choose what workouts you do daily. You don't have to be strapped into a 12 week program. We understand that sometimes you are a little sore and may need a different workout that day. You can choose that! We will also have a portal to track all of your goals, action steps and accomplishments and be able to share them in a ""member's only"" online wall. Imagine the support you get from others that may be in your shoes or have gone through it. You will also have online access to our trainers for any questions. We can reduce the world's obesity epidemic, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and many other chronic illnesses by working together!

Environmental Assessment Platform



Maintaining a healthy home environment is essential to controlling asthma.  Many children have been rushed to the ER only to return to the environment that triggered the attack in the first place.  Fortunately, there are some public health departments and non-profits that have implemented early home visit programs to assess the air quality in a home and to check for possible triggers.  The results have been wonderful, lowering ER visits by 60% on average.  However, these programs are expensive to set up and manage.  We have designed the Control A+ Environmental Assessment Platform to provide the necessary tools at a low cost. This will allow our data system and tool kit to scale to public health departments and nonprofits  across the country quickly.  All of this is accessible through an app; the connected tool kit can plug into an iPad.

Asthma Assist Device






Our device is designed to monitor vital and body indicators and the environment in order to warn when a child is at high risk of having an asthma attack. It acts as a bridge to help parents and kids control asthma triggers and irritants by giving real­time notifications of possible environmental factors that could lead to asthma attacks.  The device can calculate the environmental factors and make recommendations of activities to help the kids avoid situations that could trigger an attack.  It will also work as a home respiratory therapy tool, giving information to help children to build lung function by having them exercise at optimal times. This is accomplished through our proprietary video game controller designed to monitor their lung function while allowing activity and fun. The data collected by the device can be shared through a HIPPA-secure portal with doctors and researchers, opening a new era of real­time clinical research.


This will empower children with asthma to take an active part in managing their condition. It will alert parents of possible threats - giving them peace of mind - and it will give doctors a 360° view of their patients’ condition  and the data to make better recommendations for treatment.

Impact


Our mission is to empower asthmatics so that they can control their asthma, not be controlled by it.  The educational app and environmental tool kit alone have the potential to lower ER visits by over 50%.

With the infrastructure of the Control A+ product line, the future for asthmatics looks much brighter.   Children will have the best interactive education platform to connect the hospital to the home.  Parents, patients, and doctors will have a research tool that will take personalized medicine to the next level. Our products will lower the effects of fear-based trauma and disempowerment issues associated with asthma. Parents will have peace of mind knowing that they have effective tools to prevent their child from having an asthma attack.

Our Team

Our team is 19 people strong.  As long as asthma keeps threatening lives, we will be working as efficiently as possible to get our products into the hands of those who need it most.


Your support will make a significant difference in the lives of those who struggle to breathe everyday.  Those who are helped will be forever grateful for your generosity.",3.0,2,"1 Campaign

What would life look like, what would it feel like if you no longer had to deal with pain? My name is Danielle Hall and I am the founder and lead practitioner at Soundembrace, LLC. <br/><br/>I have a healthy discontent with the status quo and my mission is to bend and reshape your view on what life can actually be like. What it should be like. Pain free and filled with so much joy!</p><p><i><strong>I am here today because I am asking you to see what I see. This vision is bigger than me and I need your help.</strong></i><br/><br/>I help people live a life they love waking up to. I accomplish this by creating sound experiences that relieve stress, reduce pain, increase mental clarity, create ease and balance within emotions, and connect to the depth of your soul being. <br/><br/><strong>Soundembrace Health is more than an app.</strong> This is a tool for transformation on a grand scale. Through my sound healing 1 on 1 practice, I have had the opportunity to support the healing journey of so many. People with PTSD, insomnia, anxiety, people who have dealt with varying degrees of trauma, self worth issues, and life transitions. Relieving stress. Reducing pain.<br/><br/>As you will learn below, the features of the app go beyond simply sharing the power of sound healing music.  It takes into consideration that we are scientifically proven to be unique. Not one of us are the same.  Who we are, the state of our body and our mind, is a reflection, and is influenced by our genes, and the things that influence the expression (or activation) of those genes, or switch them on and off.   (This is called Epigenetic factors.)<br/><br/>By taking into consideration these Epigenetic factors, we will give you an areal view of your health and wellness story.  All of this so you can gain new perspective and awareness surrounding your goals for your health and wellbeing. Awareness provides the opportunity for choice, and it is through your choices that you have the opportunity to change the trajectory of your life.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Awareness = Empowered Choice = Opportunity for Profound Change</strong></p><p>A new paradigm in health is surfacing and it requires technological innovation. Innovations that supports and empowers individuals in their health journey.  In person Sound Healing sessions are helping so many!  Just think about the potential to help so many more with this app.</p><p>Donating will not only support the efforts to make this tool for transformation a reality, it will support the transformation that occurs when someone finally feels that sense of relief and hope they have been longing for. Something I had the opportunity to experience in my own wellness story. (Check out ""My Story"" below)</p><p>Thank you for your time and consideration in supporting this campaign.  I will be adding more content and progress reports as it all evolves.<br/><br/>In love + gratitude,<br/><br/>Danielle</p><h2><strong>My Story</strong></h2><div><div style=""text-align: center;""><div>

However, if it weren’t for <a href=""http://www.mobileapphero.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mobile App Hero</a> believing in me and my mission, the price tag for this project would have been much, much, higher.</p><ul>
<li>The funding I am asking for is going straight to the price of the app, the website creation, and branding. </li>
<li>This does not include the price to go into a professional recording studio to have the sound healing music produced, recorded, or mastered. Any donation past the set amount will go towards the music production and mastering costs.</li>
<li>Whether or not I receive full funding, all funds from this campaign will go straight into creating this app.  You will continue to receive updates on its progress and all perk promises will be delivered no later than beginning of December.</li>

The tassel represents enlightenment as all strands come together they signify the connection between all – the culmination of our prana and consciousness.<br/><br/>We are often asked what is the significance to the 108 beads. Some believe the significance ties to the 108 desires in mortals or the 108 lies that humans tell; some relate it to the 108 stages of the human soul, possibly that the path to enlightenment is attainable through taking only 108 breaths in a day while in deep meditation; others believe 1 is god/higher truth, 0 is emptiness or completeness, and 8 is eternity – the truth is both empty and complete for eternity. When meditating on your mala it is believed to be complete once you have devoted 100 mindful intentions allowing 8 exceptions for errors or distracted intentions. Element of Sri believes a mala is a very personal and sometimes even spiritual symbol which means you will be provided a differing response depending on who you ask – look within and search for your meaning. Each bead is threaded on 4 strands of cord for strength and longevity to give you plenty of time to find your truth.<br/><br/><strong>Immodesta Tea:</strong> <a href=""https://immodestea.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> https://immodestea.com</a></p><p>Immodestea is the collaboration of an Engineer and a Tea Master who want to see a more connected world.

The body heals itself when you stop your stress.  This is why the nature of sleep is so important.  Sleep says, “SHUT OFF THAT MIND!  The mind is interfering with the system.<br/><br/>When you go to sleep, all the stresses shut off and that’s when the body says,  ‘Great!  This is our opportunity to heal!’  But why wait until nighttime?<br/><br/>Energy healing is rising in our civilization because of Quantum Physics and new technology to measure the effects of Energy Medicine.”</strong></i></p><p>In terms of physical well-being, sound and music therapy can help with the following:</p><ul>

Innovations that supports and empowers individuals in their health journey.<br/><br/>Sound healing is a non-invasive healing modality that faces the same challenges as acupuncture and chiropractic services did before becoming “mainstream”. Sound Healing Therapy is not widely known, it is considered esoteric, there are many sound healing practitioners doing this work all over the country but many are not educated in how sound affects the body.  There are also many great sound healing practitioners but they know how to market their services to make a career and living out of it.  <br/><br/>My plan to remedy this is to collect the opt-in users data to submit research papers that support the credibility and validity of the field, through branding, strategic marketing and collaborations I will present Sound Healing Therapy as accessible and fun thus changing the perspective of the industry, Soundembrace will be offering Sound Healing Classes in 2018 to educate Sound Healing Practitioners and those who are curious about the therapeutic power of sound, and the app will support and promote sound healers and coaches who use the app.</p><h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504714678/nxvzckupeb63fhd02e2x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></h2><p><br/>Some of you may not be able to contribute.

Daily fatigue has increased over the past several years and my energy level has reduced greatly as a result of health issues. These sessions with Danielle have provided the greatest results of anything I have tried or the numerous professionals I have worked with towards eliminating the pain and discomfort from poor digestion. After only three visits I noticed a huge difference and after two weeks using the take home program I have more energy, virtually little to no pain or discomfort with digestion and have become clearer in my thinking thus able to successfully reduce stress and “cloudy thinking.” It is with confidence I recommend this method of healing and more specifically recommend working with Danielle.

I had been dealing with autonomic dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy for several months. I found Danielle’s mix of methodologies to be really relaxing and impactful. Our sessions would start with my feet placed on a Cyma machine that would send sound frequencies up through my feet for the duration of the session. Danielle would then open the session with a blessing or chant and begin playing the crystal bowl. The crystal bowl is an amazing instrument. It is very penetrative and put me into a theta brain wave state very quickly. For the second half of the session, Danielle would stop playing the crystal bowl and give me a reiki treatment. I found this to be really powerful as well. Over the course of a few weeks of treatment, the began having normal sensation return to my feet (I hadn’t been able to feel them for two months). I found the sessions to be very meditative and through that meditation, I was able to dissolve a lot of anger I was holding toward certain doctors that dismissed my symptoms. In the weeks to follow, I received a genetic diagnosis and am now undergoing physical rehabilitation. I am very grateful to Danielle for helping me cope with a very difficult time of uncertainty. After every session I felt relaxed and rejuvenated, as if waking from a good night’s sleep. I highly recommend Danielle’s unique method of sound healing for anyone struggling with a health or emotional issue. ”— Robynne W.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504715760/zq5yevkfxbk77q3qrqm4.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>“I just want to say thank you to Danielle for introducing me to this alternative form of healing. I live an active lifestyle, so I have accumulated wear and tear on my knees over time.<br/><br/>Most recently, I had a minor tear in my meniscus. My options were knee arthroscopy (2 week healing time) or rest and relaxation (2-3 months). I will only consider surgery as LAST and ONLY option. So, I opted to rest and let it heal. After talking with Danielle, she mentioned her sound therapy technique and how it can accelerate healing times.<br/><br/>I used the sound therapy program 1-3 times per day for about 3.5 weeks. There were no noticeable differences until the 3rd week. I had better movement and my knee was no longer locking on me. I was back in the gym going about 70% capacity of my limits shortly thereafter. The sound therapy has allowed my nagging injury to heal quicker so I can get back to the gym sooner.<br/><br/>If you are receiving another form of treatment, sound therapy can be a great compliment to expedite your recovery. Although, not at 100%, I was back in the gym less than 5 weeks after my injury. I strongly recommend this program!

During the experience, I found myself deeply relaxed and then taken into an altered state of consciousness. I saw images and received insights, but most importantly felt completely safe and surrounded by love. It felt as if many energies that were not serving me were stirred up and released. A lot of the negativity came out as a head cold which moved through in a couple of days. When I came out the other side I felt light, joyful and like I was vibrating at the “right” frequency.” — Bethany M.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504715794/ubdappcbwnkivfmhsdtn.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>“Dearest Danielle, Thank you for a truly beautiful experience this past Thursday.

Another way. What would life look like, what would it feel like if you no longer had to deal with pain? My name is Danielle Hall and I am the founder and lead practitioner at Soundembrace, LLC. I have a healthy discontent with the status quo and my mission is to bend and reshape your view on what life can actually be like. What it should be like. Pain free and filled with so much joy!I am here today because I am asking you to see what I see. This vision is bigger than me and I need your help.I help people live a life they love waking up to. I accomplish this by creating sound experiences that relieve stress, reduce pain, increase mental clarity, create ease and balance within emotions, and connect to the depth of your soul being. Soundembrace Health is more than an app. This is a tool for transformation on a grand scale. Through my sound healing 1 on 1 practice, I have had the opportunity to support the healing journey of so many. People with PTSD, insomnia, anxiety, people who have dealt with varying degrees of trauma, self worth issues, and life transitions. Relieving stress. Reducing pain.As you will learn below, the features of the app go beyond simply sharing the power of sound healing music.  It takes into consideration that we are scientifically proven to be unique. Not one of us are the same.  Who we are, the state of our body and our mind, is a reflection, and is influenced by our genes, and the things that influence the expression (or activation) of those genes, or switch them on and off.   (This is called Epigenetic factors.)By taking into consideration these Epigenetic factors, we will give you an areal view of your health and wellness story.  All of this so you can gain new perspective and awareness surrounding your goals for your health and wellbeing. Awareness provides the opportunity for choice, and it is through your choices that you have the opportunity to change the trajectory of your life.Awareness = Empowered Choice = Opportunity for Profound ChangeA new paradigm in health is surfacing and it requires technological innovation. Innovations that supports and empowers individuals in their health journey.  In person Sound Healing sessions are helping so many!  Just think about the potential to help so many more with this app.Donating will not only support the efforts to make this tool for transformation a reality, it will support the transformation that occurs when someone finally feels that sense of relief and hope they have been longing for. Something I had the opportunity to experience in my own wellness story. (Check out ""My Story"" below)Thank you for your time and consideration in supporting this campaign.  I will be adding more content and progress reports as it all evolves.In love + gratitude,DanielleMy Story
 What We Need & What You GetThis project is a huge undertaking.  So far it has been completely self-funded. However, if it weren’t for Mobile App Hero believing in me and my mission, the price tag for this project would have been much, much, higher.
The funding I am asking for is going straight to the price of the app, the website creation, and branding. 
This does not include the price to go into a professional recording studio to have the sound healing music produced, recorded, or mastered. Any donation past the set amount will go towards the music production and mastering costs.
Whether or not I receive full funding, all funds from this campaign will go straight into creating this app.  You will continue to receive updates on its progress and all perk promises will be delivered no later than beginning of December.
PERKSI am so incredibly thankful for the support of the small business owners who are supporting this campaign. Your support to this campaign is also supporting small businesses.Please note that the donation suggestions are not a representation of the cost for the perk gifts. The perks are just that; a perk, or gift for your generosity to this campaign.Here is a little more information about the perk gifts attached to your donation:Wild at Heart Ritual Essential Oils:  IG  Wild_at_Heart_Ritual Butterfly Essential Oil Blend 7.5mlThis blend is intended to bring about feelings of ""lightness"" and ""cheerfulness"". Connecting with the spirit of the Butterfly.Ingredients: Organic Coconut oil, Bergamot, Lavender, Lemon & Clary Sage Yo Soy Candles:  https://www.yosoycandles.com/I AM LIGHT 4oz CandleThis fragrance is a soft, well-balanced blend of tea, spices and musk that helps to provoke a sense of comfort and confidence in oneself to move forward in goals and aspirations.All candles are hand poured in small batches using 100% US grown soy wax, cotton wick, essential oil and fine fragrance blends. Our products are free of phthalates, dyes, lead and parabens. Made in Portland, Oregon.Burn time: 4oz 15-20 hrs- smaller rooms (bath, office)Element of Sri: https://www.etsy.com/shop/elementofsriMala Bracelet (6in) or Mala Necklace (19in)Materials: Amethethyst, wood, tasselEach “eos intentions” tassel is handmade with 108 strands bound 8 times. The tassel represents enlightenment as all strands come together they signify the connection between all – the culmination of our prana and consciousness.We are often asked what is the significance to the 108 beads. Some believe the significance ties to the 108 desires in mortals or the 108 lies that humans tell; some relate it to the 108 stages of the human soul, possibly that the path to enlightenment is attainable through taking only 108 breaths in a day while in deep meditation; others believe 1 is god/higher truth, 0 is emptiness or completeness, and 8 is eternity – the truth is both empty and complete for eternity. When meditating on your mala it is believed to be complete once you have devoted 100 mindful intentions allowing 8 exceptions for errors or distracted intentions. Element of Sri believes a mala is a very personal and sometimes even spiritual symbol which means you will be provided a differing response depending on who you ask – look within and search for your meaning. Each bead is threaded on 4 strands of cord for strength and longevity to give you plenty of time to find your truth.Immodesta Tea:  https://immodestea.comImmodestea is the collaboration of an Engineer and a Tea Master who want to see a more connected world. With dedication to 3 major values, Quality, Education and Community, we work to connect the world through immersive events and healthy, intelligent products. Our tea subscriptions are the best way to bring the rejuvenating practice of gong-fu style tea into your own life, a practice designed to enrich your body and your relationships and you please. We often pair tea ceremony with live Sound Healing events; together let's bring the holistic experience into your own home.From this campaign, you would receive a flight of one style of tea all the information you need to brew and recount the history of that tea.  Please note that this package only contains the tea.  Not the essentials for brewing. The ImpactAmericans are under so much stress it's now registering on the American Psychological Association's anxiety meter. The APA has recognized that up to 90% of illnesses and Dr. visits are due to the nature of stress.  (1) The CDC has called chronic disease “the public health challenge of the 21st century.”  Studies have found many health problems are related to stress. Stress seems to worsen or increase the risk of conditions like obesity, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, depression, gastrointestinal problems, and asthma.  (2)One out of three Americans will die prematurely from a condition that’s mostly related to lifestyle, habit, or circumstance. These are conditions that pills and procedures can control but not fix. (2)Your contribution will support the creation of a powerful tool that will support many people in relieving stress and the chronic symptoms it manifests.Soundembrace Health uses psychoacoustics, binaural beats, and Epigenetic research to help clients improve their health and reduce their risk of chronic disease by relieving stress, and reducing pain through sound healing therapy.  Although we cannot say we can heal, we can say that we create the environment for the body to go into its own natural healing state, being a catalyst for positive change in ones health and wellbeing. Bruce Lipton:“When you receive music such as sound healing music that has a nice flow and harmonic resonance to it, it entrains you, it causes the mind to stop all the stress, and calm down, and work to become more harmonious and more flowing.  If you can just do that, it would be a primary incentive for the body to heal itself. The body heals itself when you stop your stress.  This is why the nature of sleep is so important.  Sleep says, “SHUT OFF THAT MIND!  The mind is interfering with the system.When you go to sleep, all the stresses shut off and that’s when the body says,  ‘Great!  This is our opportunity to heal!’  But why wait until nighttime?Energy healing is rising in our civilization because of Quantum Physics and new technology to measure the effects of Energy Medicine.”In terms of physical well-being, sound and music therapy can help with the following:
Higher levels of energy
Sense of balance & direction improved
Fewer headaches
Lessening of sensitivity to particular sounds
Relief from chronic tiredness
Relieve the sensation of shortness of breath or tightness in the chest
Lower cortisol, blood pressure, reduced heart rate, relaxed muscle tension, and reducing stress
Emotional benefits include:
Relief from anxiety
More confidence
Less frustration
Improved ability to relax
Improvement in overall “mood”
Improved patience
Better ability to communicate and interact with others
Improved ability to express emotions
Mental benefits include:
Brain “fog” dissipates
More motivated in life
Improved ability to listen to new ideas with an open mind
Better organization skills
Improvement in attention span
Less likely to become irritable

Innovations that supports and empowers individuals in their health journey.Sound healing is a non-invasive healing modality that faces the same challenges as acupuncture and chiropractic services did before becoming “mainstream”. Sound Healing Therapy is not widely known, it is considered esoteric, there are many sound healing practitioners doing this work all over the country but many are not educated in how sound affects the body.  There are also many great sound healing practitioners but they know how to market their services to make a career and living out of it.  My plan to remedy this is to collect the opt-in users data to submit research papers that support the credibility and validity of the field, through branding, strategic marketing and collaborations I will present Sound Healing Therapy as accessible and fun thus changing the perspective of the industry, Soundembrace will be offering Sound Healing Classes in 2018 to educate Sound Healing Practitioners and those who are curious about the therapeutic power of sound, and the app will support and promote sound healers and coaches who use the app.Other Ways You Can HelpSome of you may not be able to contribute.

Research Studies:A study by NCBI,  has shown the effectiveness of recorded, and in-person Vibroacoustic Therapy sessions (aka Sound Healing Therapy) with sound healing instruments on emotional health)The National Institute of Health, Government of USA researched Vibroacoustic music (VAM) offered to hospitalized patients. The results indicate over 50% reduction of pain and symptoms.Neuroscientist Jessica Grahn of the University of Western Ontario studies how music and rhythm can entrain muscles, providing external timing to help the brain compensate. Her research adds to growing evidence for music as a therapy for Parkinson’s symptoms.In 2008, the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine published a review of 20 studies of brain-wave entrainment and patient outcomes. The conclusion was that brain-wave entrainment is an effective tool to use on cognitive functioning deficits, stress, pain, headaches, and premenstrual syndrome.Cymatics is a word coined by Dr. Hans Jenny, a Swiss medical doctor, who investigated the power of sound to create form. His Cymatic experiments show the effects of sound waves upon many different types of material, including water, pastes, liquids and plastics. Dr. Jenny’s work demonstrates positive proof of the amazing power of sound to create form.Japanese researcher Mr. Masaru Emoto work provides factual evidence that human vibrational energy, thoughts, words, ideas and sound affect the molecular structure of water.Dr. Mitchel Gaynor links sound healing to music therapy. In ""The Healing Power of Sound"" he cites studies indicating that music can lower blood pressure, reduce cardiac complications among patients who have recently suffered heart attacks, reduce stress hormones during medical testing and boost natural opiates.Alfred A. Tomatis was an internationally known otolaryngologist, and inventor. He discovered that you don’t normally make frequencies with the voice that you don’t hear. Testimonials:“Before meeting Danielle I had never heard of a sound bath, and now I’m obsessed. It feels hard to explain one until you’ve experienced it, but I would describe it some sort of magical combination between the best meditation session, nap and orgasm you’ve ever had. It’s a full body, transcendent experience and release like nothing else I’ve experienced. Things that I didn’t even know were blocked and stuck in my body started shifting and releasing and I felt so much freer afterwards. Danielle is amazing and her passion, talent and wisdom make this experience so special.”  — Julia W.“Through working with Danielle with Soundembrace I have gained tremendous health improvement in a very short time. I am continually learning and expanding my knowledge of the many methods available to eliminate painful and uncomfortable digestive problems as well as I have tried any number of ways to obtain greater clarity and concentration in my personal and work life. Daily fatigue has increased over the past several years and my energy level has reduced greatly as a result of health issues. These sessions with Danielle have provided the greatest results of anything I have tried or the numerous professionals I have worked with towards eliminating the pain and discomfort from poor digestion. After only three visits I noticed a huge difference and after two weeks using the take home program I have more energy, virtually little to no pain or discomfort with digestion and have become clearer in my thinking thus able to successfully reduce stress and “cloudy thinking.” It is with confidence I recommend this method of healing and more specifically recommend working with Danielle. It is obvious to me that she has chosen a career well suited to her… and there is no doubt she will change the lives of many people.” — Sharon K.“Both as a participant of Danielle’s Sound Bath, and of her individual sessions, I have to say that everything from her bedside manner (it’s almost a pun) to her techniques and the effectiveness of the sessions is fantastic. I’m solidly a fan of what she does, and excited to be able to benefit from the skills she has. Her awareness, and realism combined with fantastic enthusiasm make for enriching discussions and sessions leading to discovery, acceptance, and what feels like genuine growth.As someone who has experienced a great deal of their life fighting illness, constant nutritional challenges, and wondering if I was supposed to be sick all the time, it has been great to be able to learn from her own experiences in this regard.If you respond well to energy and sound work, she expresses and practices fantastically in both, in an almost effortless way, I definitely recommend her.” — Dave E.“My session with Danielle was nothing short of amazing. The insights we both received during the session were profound and Danielle really took the time to make sure that I felt grounded and complete before we finished. I will definitely be booking another session the next time I’m in San Francisco! Thank you” — Abby M.“I am 64 years old, and had been in daily pain since my motorcycle accident in 1976. (… I had a broken neck, I believe C5, as well as other injuries and nerve damage… Spent 1 year in a “circle bed”, another 6 months in Crutchfield Tongs, then a 4 poster collar for 4 months, on to re-hab for 3 months where I learned to walk again.) After the awful experience with my recovery, I was DONE with doctors and did not attend my physical therapy sessions.I sought help (38 years later!) because I had been living in pain since the accident. The pain had become more and more difficult to manage. I was so amazed at how I felt after just 1 session with Danielle I continued sessions almost every week for a year. In that year, I had 3-4 in person sessions a month while also playing the daily take home program on my legs. I am now living pain free! No more restless leg syndrome, I have feeling back in my feet (!), and I sleep better than ever before. I am so glad I gave sound therapy a try. I highly recommend it!” — Charley H.“I tried a session with Danielle not knowing what to expect and am so glad I did! It was SO relaxing, and my tight shoulders and back really needed that kind of deep release. I’m an active person – I run, dance, and do lots of yoga – but sometimes my muscles are so tight that I hold back because I’m afraid I’ll overdo it and strain myself. I know my tension comes mostly from stress and too much time in front of my computer, so giving myself the time to relax so deeply (I felt like I dropped into another world inside of myself for a while) was exactly what I needed to go back out into my week and ride the waves without getting overwhelmed. Not only had my body let go, but my mind felt way more at ease, grounded, and flexible too. Amazing medicine. Thank you, Danielle!”— Alex M“I didn’t know much about sound therapy when I began Soundembrace sessions with Danielle. I had been dealing with autonomic dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy for several months. I found Danielle’s mix of methodologies to be really relaxing and impactful. Our sessions would start with my feet placed on a Cyma machine that would send sound frequencies up through my feet for the duration of the session. Danielle would then open the session with a blessing or chant and begin playing the crystal bowl. The crystal bowl is an amazing instrument. It is very penetrative and put me into a theta brain wave state very quickly. For the second half of the session, Danielle would stop playing the crystal bowl and give me a reiki treatment. I found this to be really powerful as well. Over the course of a few weeks of treatment, the began having normal sensation return to my feet (I hadn’t been able to feel them for two months). I found the sessions to be very meditative and through that meditation, I was able to dissolve a lot of anger I was holding toward certain doctors that dismissed my symptoms. In the weeks to follow, I received a genetic diagnosis and am now undergoing physical rehabilitation. I am very grateful to Danielle for helping me cope with a very difficult time of uncertainty. After every session I felt relaxed and rejuvenated, as if waking from a good night’s sleep. I highly recommend Danielle’s unique method of sound healing for anyone struggling with a health or emotional issue. ”— Robynne W.“I just want to say thank you to Danielle for introducing me to this alternative form of healing. I live an active lifestyle, so I have accumulated wear and tear on my knees over time.Most recently, I had a minor tear in my meniscus. My options were knee arthroscopy (2 week healing time) or rest and relaxation (2-3 months). I will only consider surgery as LAST and ONLY option. So, I opted to rest and let it heal. After talking with Danielle, she mentioned her sound therapy technique and how it can accelerate healing times.I used the sound therapy program 1-3 times per day for about 3.5 weeks. There were no noticeable differences until the 3rd week. I had better movement and my knee was no longer locking on me. I was back in the gym going about 70% capacity of my limits shortly thereafter. The sound therapy has allowed my nagging injury to heal quicker so I can get back to the gym sooner.If you are receiving another form of treatment, sound therapy can be a great compliment to expedite your recovery. Although, not at 100%, I was back in the gym less than 5 weeks after my injury. I strongly recommend this program! Thanks Dani!” — Greg K.“I was blessed to be a part of the “sound bath” that Danielle facilitated at a recent WOW event. During the experience, I found myself deeply relaxed and then taken into an altered state of consciousness. I saw images and received insights, but most importantly felt completely safe and surrounded by love. It felt as if many energies that were not serving me were stirred up and released. A lot of the negativity came out as a head cold which moved through in a couple of days. When I came out the other side I felt light, joyful and like I was vibrating at the “right” frequency.” — Bethany M.“Dearest Danielle, Thank you for a truly beautiful experience this past Thursday. It was deeply nourishing and I felt a level of peace and true relaxation like never before. Really grateful for you and your band of healers.”— Megan R.“Danielle has been my guide in adventures through sound, helping me to lead to full health both physically and mentally. I am still on my journey to full health, but after one session I became more aware and in tune with my thought patterns that were causing stress – which my body was physically reacting to.In the session, she carefully listened to my words and described her suggested treatment with details of what it would entail. My treatment happened to be a combination of binaural beats to reach theta brain waves for relaxation while Danielle used reiki techniques and crystals to release any blocked energy. We ended the session by discussing my experiences and her observations, and she sent me home with some tips and mental exercises to think about. While new to healing sessions, her calmness and clear explanation took away any anxiety I may have had with a new experience.I have been able to sleep deeper as an immediate result to the session. She has followed up with me to see how my healing process has been. I feel a good amount of progress just from my first session, and can’t wait to return to keep the healing process moving forward.

We are just an ordinary married couple with a passion for non-invasive, alternative forms of therapy.  Evanston Float Center is a flotation and massage therapy center located in Evanston, IL.  We put a lot of thought into opening up a float therapy and massage spa with the intentions of helping people relax and heal. It came about one day when Marlon, who is a licensed massage therapist, had mentioned how great it would be if we had our own massage center that had Epsom salt baths available. Clients could soak right after getting a massage and receive the additional health benefits the salts can provide by helping with soreness and acting as a natural muscle relaxer.  One week later, fate introduced us to floating. We loved it so much and received immediate benefits from floating, we couldn't stop talking about how great it would be if we could open a massage and float center. Then we took that leap of faith. With a lot of help from family and friends and a ton of hard work and passion, we are making our dreams come to fruition. We want everyone to experience the awesome benefits as we have! </span><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442942882/olrgjpojq2wkv9m4dulp.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 408.595988538682px; height: 230px;""/></p>

</div></div>","Our StoryThank you for visiting our Indiegogo page! We are just an ordinary married couple with a passion for non-invasive, alternative forms of therapy.  Evanston Float Center is a flotation and massage therapy center located in Evanston, IL.  We put a lot of thought into opening up a float therapy and massage spa with the intentions of helping people relax and heal. It came about one day when Marlon, who is a licensed massage therapist, had mentioned how great it would be if we had our own massage center that had Epsom salt baths available. Clients could soak right after getting a massage and receive the additional health benefits the salts can provide by helping with soreness and acting as a natural muscle relaxer.  One week later, fate introduced us to floating. We loved it so much and received immediate benefits from floating, we couldn't stop talking about how great it would be if we could open a massage and float center. Then we took that leap of faith. With a lot of help from family and friends and a ton of hard work and passion, we are making our dreams come to fruition. We want everyone to experience the awesome benefits as we have! 
We all experience the aches and pains created from stress, school, sports, physical labor and work. We all experience the constant noise and distractions from the internet and cell phones. We want to provide a unique place for people to get away from the daily distractions, where your mind and body can truly relax, rest, and rejuvenate.                         What We Need & What You GetWe are on track to open our doors this fall 2015, however we need a little help from you.  We want everyone to be able to experience massage and floating, and all the great benefits it provides. We already have two massage therapy rooms and one float room.                   We have had such a huge response and the demand for massage and floating is on the rise. We believe that most first time floaters would like to bring a friend to enjoy the experience with (in a separate room of course!.... because that would be weird). So, we need your help to raise $25,000 so we can add a second float room to our space to compliment the second massage room. We will be giving great deals on floats and massages as perks to help us.   Money will be used to purchase a second spa, plus materials to build and soundproof the room, and install a shower.The Benefits of FloatingSome people describe floating as ""relaxing in your own, private Dead Sea."" It's over 800 pounds of Epsom salts dissolved in a tub of 10 inches of water, that has been heated to your skin temperature.  As you lay back in the water, you will float, just as if you were at the Dead Sea. The tub is completely sound and lightproof, providing the ultimate conditions for your mind and body to relax. Since there is no sensory stimulus for your brain to process, the parasympathetic nervous system (Rest and Digest) activates, which is associated with promoting healing, regeneration and nourishment,  and up-regulating the immune system of the body. During the experience of floating, the Epsom salt alone helps to reduce inflammation, improves skin problems, increases blood flow and soothes the muscles and aching limbs.

<b>Our story</b> began at <span>2am</span> on June 23, 2011 when a 4 yr old male came into<br/>
our Critical Access Emergency Department in acute respiratory<br/>
distress. His seal bark cough and high pitched stridor had him in a<br/>
panic. His room air oxygen saturation was 83%. He fought Paula's efforts to place a<br/>
pediatric oxygen mask on him so she relented and gave him blow by oxygen<br/>
while Melissa summoned the ED doctor and set up the first nebulizer for<br/>
the child.<br/>
Once his airway opened up and he was sleeping we regrouped at<br/>
the nurse's station to discuss the case. It was during that conversation that we passionately agreed that there must be a way to deliver chilled mist to a swollen airway via nebulizer.<br/>
We took the concept of chilled mist reducing airway edema home to our<br/>
kitchens and the first homemade prototypes of ChillyNeb were made.<br/>
Within 10 days we consulted a patent attorney and thus our journey<br/>
began.<br/>
Over the past four years we have worked quietly and diligently to improve the design, tested multiple cooling materials, continued with the patent process<br/>
and are patent pending. The idea of ChillyNeb was expanded to animals with the<br/>
addition of the ChillyNeb pet mask.  <br/>We are excited and proud of this simple little device. We know<br/>
it works and we want to share it with everyone.<br/><br/>
What's next for ChillyNeb?  Well the truth is we need your help to reach our goal of $65,000.00 The next steps for ChillyNeb are an engineered prototype, international patent application and further research and development. <br/>

              <br/>
<p><b>What
is a nebulizer?</b></p>
<p>In healthcare, a <b>nebulizer</b> is a drug delivery system used to administer medication or
solution in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs.</p>
<p>Nebulizers are
commonly used for the treatment of asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis

<p>Nebulizers use oxygen, compressed air or ultrasonic
power to break up medical solutions and suspensions into small aerosol
droplets (mist) that can be directly inhaled from the mouthpiece of the device. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>What
are the snowflakes made of?</b></p>
<p>The snowflakes are made from an
evaporative fabric. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why
did you choose the snowflakes as a cooling material?</b></p>
<p><b>Several
reasons actually. </b></p>
<p><b>1</b>-The snowflakes are light weight when dry
and can be stored within the container of ChillyNeb until used. </p>
<p><b>2-</b>After the snowflakes are wet and shaken
cooling is activated and then simple evaporation continues the cooling process.
If the snowflakes get dry just add enough water to moisten and shake and the
cooling process will continue.</p>
<p><b>3-
</b>When you combine the
factors of both 1 &amp; 2 you have the perfect material for use in any
environment where there is no ice, i.e. desert, under developed areas and pre-hospital care to list just a few.</p>

In
 a controlled environment this device predictably chilled nebulized mist
 to a Celsius temperature significantly less than ambient temperature 
for one hour. This graph compares four types of Thermal medium for 
cooling liquid that is nebulized to chilled mist. Four of the five 
configurations tested remained consistently under 10 degrees Celsius at 
the eight minute mark until termination of testing. The fifth 
configuration remained under 13 degrees Celsius from the five minute 
mark until termination of testing. All configurations indicate a slight 
increase in temperature when additional fluid was added to continue 
adequate mist production. The optional disposable insulator is a foil

<p><b>Team Work &amp; Effective
communication</b></p>
<p>We always hear about team work and effective communication in every organization!
Both are very much needed to be successful in any organization and in our daily
life. We have thousand tools and trainings to do it! ""In reality  are they effective?"" </p>
<p>Being a leader for many projects myself, I asked these questions several times.
Do my team members purposely don’t want to collaborate to complete a task nor
do they miss it for not being able to do an adequate follow up?</p>
<p>That question ended up me to designing an effective communication
tool. The idea ""meetingmate” was born in 2011 and it took time to
shape it to see in a simplified way.  Once anyone starts using
meetingmate, won't struggle to catch up the tasks and pending to complete on
time. Because they won't be wasting time by sinking in thousands of e-mails or
meeting minutes to find out what to do and when, then try to delegate it or
doing it. By using meetingmate, the actions can be accessed from anywhere,
delegating it in real time and everything remains in one place.</p>
<p>The task, a responsible, a target date and finally the status, that's
all we need to be successful in team work. But the real question is how do
you communicate the action plan effectively and how do you follow up that every
day, when everyone need to go to hundreds of meetings and to perform
thousands of actions every year? </p>
<p>Meeting mate will simplify the daily life for you!</p>
<p><b>Expenses meeting
Expectations</b></p>
<ul>
<li>We are looking for 500,000 USD as a first
     round of funding to create the full time equipped office, with all
     infrastructure needed and also to hire services and talented professionals
     like software integrators, web- graphic designers, supporting engineers
     &amp; marketing professionals to support the further development globally</li>
<li>We offer our contributors, licensed software
     usage – Please see the rewards section for further details! </li>
<li>The amount collected through this funding will
     be used to the development of meeting mate to make people’s life easy. And
     10% of the collected amount will be used for education of children in
     need. </li>
<li>We have experience in creating web based systems
     &amp; communities. Please check <a href=""http://www.toolinghub.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.toolinghub.com</u></a>
     a community for tooling experts around the world. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Stress free management of daily tasks and
assignments</b></p>
<ul>
</ul><p>Most of the people are responsible and want to
     accomplish their assignments or tasks on time, but that’s not possible in
     our traditional way how we address it. </p><ul>
</ul>
<p>I am sure most of you are
in a situation today, when hundred things to be done and all are priorities,  and
the requests are coming from thousand directions. The way of lean culture
requires us to be more efficient in multi-tasking. There is nothing wrong in
hiring people with that capability. But all industries cannot afford to pay the
cost of such professionals. But actually they don’t need to. Because
“meetingmate” simplifies the multi-tasking needs and create a stress free
working environment.  </p>
<p>I had the honor to work
with many teams to make million dollar savings projects, and believe me, I have
seen people trying to do everything possible, even myself, to track the tasks
and accomplish it, on time. As a leader of, sometimes, up to 30+ projects I
wished if all my tasks were in same place so I could track progress of
everything, delegate work and see the progress in same place. Meetingmate
will perfectly blends that need.</p><p>Meetinmate will also help you when, one of your key members leaving the organization in the middle of a key project. All pending tasks and information will be on ""meetingmate"" to ensure s smooth transition not he project when this kind of thing happens""</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Making this meeting administration simple for the
     end user need a lot of complex web architecture behind the screens and we
     are working with renowned developers</li>
<li>Our site is hosted with biggest players like
     Yahoo to support the challenges in today’s internet scenario.</li>
<li>To reach the audiences of allover the world we
     will be using marketing tools of all social media and a dedicated
     marketing team.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Why we are looking for your support</b></p>
<p>We have already started! You can login and see the site basic functions
at <a href=""http://www.meetingmate.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.meetingmate.org</u></a> . But we have
long way to go to make it fully functional &amp; create apps to launch meetingmate
with mobile phones and tablets. We really need your helping hands to bring
meetingmate quicker to a wide audience. Your support will cover the cost of the
software development, certifications and app developments.</p>
<p>We chose Indiegogo to introduce meetingmate, because it has the best
community who like to support the real entrepreneur’s dreams to make it reality.

We always hear about team work and effective communication in every organization!
Both are very much needed to be successful in any organization and in our daily
life. We have thousand tools and trainings to do it! ""In reality  are they effective?"" 
Being a leader for many projects myself, I asked these questions several times.
Do my team members purposely don’t want to collaborate to complete a task nor
do they miss it for not being able to do an adequate follow up?
That question ended up me to designing an effective communication
tool. The idea ""meetingmate” was born in 2011 and it took time to
shape it to see in a simplified way.  Once anyone starts using
meetingmate, won't struggle to catch up the tasks and pending to complete on
time. Because they won't be wasting time by sinking in thousands of e-mails or
meeting minutes to find out what to do and when, then try to delegate it or
doing it. By using meetingmate, the actions can be accessed from anywhere,
delegating it in real time and everything remains in one place.
The task, a responsible, a target date and finally the status, that's
all we need to be successful in team work. But the real question is how do
you communicate the action plan effectively and how do you follow up that every
day, when everyone need to go to hundreds of meetings and to perform
thousands of actions every year? 
Meeting mate will simplify the daily life for you!

Stress free management of daily tasks and
assignments

Most of the people are responsible and want to
     accomplish their assignments or tasks on time, but that’s not possible in
     our traditional way how we address it. 

I am sure most of you are
in a situation today, when hundred things to be done and all are priorities,  and
the requests are coming from thousand directions. The way of lean culture
requires us to be more efficient in multi-tasking. There is nothing wrong in
hiring people with that capability. But all industries cannot afford to pay the
cost of such professionals. But actually they don’t need to. Because
“meetingmate” simplifies the multi-tasking needs and create a stress free
working environment.  
I had the honor to work
with many teams to make million dollar savings projects, and believe me, I have
seen people trying to do everything possible, even myself, to track the tasks
and accomplish it, on time. As a leader of, sometimes, up to 30+ projects I
wished if all my tasks were in same place so I could track progress of
everything, delegate work and see the progress in same place. Meetingmate
will perfectly blends that need.Meetinmate will also help you when, one of your key members leaving the organization in the middle of a key project. All pending tasks and information will be on ""meetingmate"" to ensure s smooth transition not he project when this kind of thing happens""

<h2>MY STORY:</h2>Hi my name is Griffin Black, I am the founder &amp; CEO of Dirtea. I a<span style=""background-color: initial;"">ttended Hunter College in Manhattan with a keen interest in nursing/healthcare but soon realized that my passion was in starting my own business. I happened to fall in the love with a girl I met in school and we eventually moved into our own apartment in Brooklyn. She introduced me to the world of tea and then I fell in love again, this time with tea. My passion turned into an obsession and I began connecting with tea vendors around the world. I began selling loose leaf tea on eBay but eventually came up with this new concept. I tested many formulations and researched the benefits of topical tea for your skin for more than 6 months and continue to test and perfect our formulations as we plan to get clinical trials done within this year. It is my dream to cultivate my own tea farm here in America one day and I am truly grateful for the two years of support my friends/family/followers have provided me with for this endeavor. </span>

Results after just over a week of using Dirtea for 28 days. The picture on the left is before my first scrub and the picture on the right is after my scrub today, foundation and concealer free and just wearing bronzer. I'd never thought I'd be confident enough to go foundation free, but this scrub has almost completely cleared my skin and acne scars and completely brightened my complexion.

<h2><strong><span>FAQ:</span></strong></h2>
<h3><strong><span>How do I get Dirtea? </span></strong></h3>
<p>Dirtea should be used to exfoliate 2-3 times per week. When starting on your course try to leave the scrub on your skin for at least 5 minutes. Ideally the longer you leave the scrub on the better it works. </p>
<h3><strong>Why is green tea good for my skin?</strong></h3>
<p>Numerous credible independent studies show topical green tea formulations protect skin from cancer and reduce sun damage.There is well documented evidence that green tea has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that help clear acne, inflammation, scarring and signs of aging. Green tea polyphenols are oxidized and lose their activity when exposed to air &amp; light, so we pack our containers fresh and seal our scrub at source to help retain activity. </p>
<h3>Why is white tea good for my skin?</h3>
<p>Dr. Camouse and colleagues from University Hospitals, Cleveland, Ohio, compared UV-protection effects of topical green and white tea and found them to be roughly equivalent (Experimental Dermatology, June 2009). However, there is promising data that white tea may even be the most superior rejuvenation agent - compared with 21 other plant extracts it showed the highest level of activity as an antioxidant.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is sweet almond oil good for my skin?</strong></h3>
<p>Sweet almond oil is one of the best known natural oil remedies for stretch marks. It's also packed with essential vitamins and minerals such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, vitamins E and D which are great for dry skin and dark spots too! </p>
<h3><strong>Why is coconut oil good for my skin?</strong></h3>
<p>Coconut oil is popular for a reason. Haven't you heard? Besides being one of the best ingredients to hydrate your skin on the market it has antibacterial and antifungal properties so you don't turn into a mushroom. Seriously though, it's amazing.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is black tea good for my skin?</strong></h3>
<p>CAFFEINE! BLACK TEA IS FULL OF CAFFEINE! CAFFEINE ENERGIZES NOT JUST YOU BUT YOUR SKIN. THE BENEFITS OF BLACK TEA FOR YOUR SKIN ARE POWERFUL (THINK BETTER BLOOD CIRCULATION &amp; LESS WRINKLY). BUT I THINK I'VE HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH. </p>
<h3><strong>Why is pink himalyan sea salt good for my skin?</strong></h3>
<p>If you can't take a trip to the Dead Sea then this is the next best thing. It's an ideal natural treatment for psoriasis and eczema because, for many, it has the best results compared to other therapies. It's been proven to lengthen the remission duration after weekly use. </p>
<h3><strong>Is Dirtea tested on animals?</strong></h3>
<p>No, we have never tested on animals and we never will. However, we do test and get Dirtea ourselves on a weekly basis because it's awesome. Sometimes I feel like an animal though.</p>
<h3><strong>Is Dirtea vegan?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, there are no animal bi-products in our scrub. </p>
<h3><strong>How long before I see results?</strong></h3>
<p>Immediately. No we're not kidding, your skin will feel incredibly smooth right after using this scrub and a lovely scent will linger. Apply 2-3 times a week and you will see results or your money back. </p>
<h3><strong>Is getting Dirtea good for sensitive skin?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes, try patch testing first before you rub it all over just to make sure you don't irritate your sensitive side. The majority will have no problem with this scrub but be extra gentle on your face. </p>
<h3><strong>Is getting Dirtea good for oily skin?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes again, oil absorbs oil. Woah that's pretty darn cool. Use a body wash to rinse off any excess oil and you'll be good to go!</p>
<h3>Is getting Dirtea good for combination skin?</h3>
<p>Yes already! Getting Dirtea will take care of your whole body, no matter what skin type you are. There's no discrimination here. We still recommend patch testing your first application. And remember kids, don't eat anything Dirtea and don't get anything Dirtea in your eyes.</p>
<h3>How Dirtea should I get?</h3>
<p>As Dirtea as you want! Each container holds 7fl oz of body scrub good for an entire months worth use. </p>
<h3>How often should I get Dirtea?</h3>
<p>We recommend 2-3 scrubs a week. Getting Dirtea is better in moderation.</p>
<h3>Should I get Dirtea wet or dry?</h3>
<p>We like damp skin - a happy medium. However if you would like a more intense treatment, Dirtea works well on dry skin too.</p>
<h3>How long do I stay Dirtea before rinsing?</h3>
<p>The key is to leave the scrub on for 5-10 minutes each time, this way the caffeine and antioxidants can be better absorbed into your skin.</p>
<h3>Why is Dirtea dry?</h3>
<p>Dirtea isn't like the other scrubs you might be used to. It's a dry scrub. If you prefer a wet scrub just add water.</p>
<h3>Will getting Dirtea clog my drain?</h3>
<p>Nope, the scrub is fine enough to wash down the drain. It's going to get a little messy though. It's good to get things Dirtea sometimes.</p>
<h3>Which scrub is better?</h3>
<p>We recommend getting the bundle if you can't decide! ;)  </p>
<h3>What payment methods are accepted?</h3>
<p>Visa. Mastercard. PayPal. American Express. Discover. </p>
<h3>How long does shipping take?</h3>
<p>We ship USPS first class mail. Usually 3-4 days. And tracking information is provided. Worlwide shipping takes a little longer depending on customs but usually within a week. </p>
<h3>Will getting Dirtea stain my skin?</h3>
<p>No. Your skin may look a little green or brown while you use it but the color will wash off right away. That fresh mint, coconut, or lemon scent (whichever scrub you choose) will linger.</p>
<h3>What if I get Dirtea in my eyes?</h3>
<p>Wash it out babe. Keep this scrub out of your eyes. If this occurs rinse thoroughly. If irritation occurs, discontinue use and seek medical assistance. Unlikely so hey, stay positive. </p>
<h3>Can I get Dirtea on my face?</h3>
<p>If you have sensitive skin, be gentle. Dirtea can be a coarse exfoliator for some and the skin on your face is delicate. If you want to use it on your face, test first, and use a soap free cleanser to wash off any excess oil.</p>
<h3>I'm pregnant, can I still get Dirtea?</h3>
<p>Hey beautiful mamma to be. As much as we want to get Dirtea with you, we recommend you consult your doctor before you start using our scrub. Dirtea does have a high caffeine content as well as peppermint oil, so some ladies choose to wait and use Dirtea after they have their babe. However, if you are still drinking tea/coffee it shouldn't be an issue.</p>
<h3>How long will getting Dirtea last?</h3>
<p>Dirtea scrubs have a shelf life of nine months. </p>

With the help of your contributions we can bring this revolutionary concept to the world and help others realize their true inner beauty with the power of this wonderful plant.  WHY WE'RE RAISING MONEY:We have exhausted nearly all of our inventory trying to keep up with demand and now we are currently out of stock on our website. The money raised from this campaign will go towards fulfilling orders/perks, ordering new sustainable packaging, and improving production equipment. You will receive our NEW products fast - by April 2016! This is also in preparation for upcoming deals with 3 large retailers who have expressed interest in our products (Wholefoods, Boots, Walgreens) however, we cannot fulfill their large quantity requests for the first round of production. Our main purpose and driving motivation behind this brand is not only skin health but earth health. Many large beauty corporations still test on animals, pollute oceans with micro-beads, and contain harmful chemical ingredients. By ordering our products you support a better future for the health/beauty industry.




MY STORY:Hi my name is Griffin Black, I am the founder & CEO of Dirtea. I attended Hunter College in Manhattan with a keen interest in nursing/healthcare but soon realized that my passion was in starting my own business. I happened to fall in the love with a girl I met in school and we eventually moved into our own apartment in Brooklyn. She introduced me to the world of tea and then I fell in love again, this time with tea. My passion turned into an obsession and I began connecting with tea vendors around the world. I began selling loose leaf tea on eBay but eventually came up with this new concept. I tested many formulations and researched the benefits of topical tea for your skin for more than 6 months and continue to test and perfect our formulations as we plan to get clinical trials done within this year. It is my dream to cultivate my own tea farm here in America one day and I am truly grateful for the two years of support my friends/family/followers have provided me with for this endeavor.

Recent Reviews/Results: 










Before & After Results: 
""INSANE. Was so sooo skeptical to try a new scrub due to the fact Frank® coffee body scrub irritated my skin like crazy, but incredibly glad I did. Results after just over a week of using Dirtea for 28 days. The picture on the left is before my first scrub and the picture on the right is after my scrub today, foundation and concealer free and just wearing bronzer. I'd never thought I'd be confident enough to go foundation free, but this scrub has almost completely cleared my skin and acne scars and completely brightened my complexion. IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH ACNE PLEASE TRY THIS.""

Sweet almond oil is one of the best known natural oil remedies for stretch marks. It's also packed with essential vitamins and minerals such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, vitamins E and D which are great for dry skin and dark spots too! 
Why is coconut oil good for my skin?
Coconut oil is popular for a reason. Haven't you heard? Besides being one of the best ingredients to hydrate your skin on the market it has antibacterial and antifungal properties so you don't turn into a mushroom. Seriously though, it's amazing.
Why is black tea good for my skin?
CAFFEINE! BLACK TEA IS FULL OF CAFFEINE! CAFFEINE ENERGIZES NOT JUST YOU BUT YOUR SKIN. THE BENEFITS OF BLACK TEA FOR YOUR SKIN ARE POWERFUL (THINK BETTER BLOOD CIRCULATION & LESS WRINKLY). BUT I THINK I'VE HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH. 
Why is pink himalyan sea salt good for my skin?
If you can't take a trip to the Dead Sea then this is the next best thing. It's an ideal natural treatment for psoriasis and eczema because, for many, it has the best results compared to other therapies. It's been proven to lengthen the remission duration after weekly use. 
Is Dirtea tested on animals?
No, we have never tested on animals and we never will. However, we do test and get Dirtea ourselves on a weekly basis because it's awesome. Sometimes I feel like an animal though.
Is Dirtea vegan?
Yes, there are no animal bi-products in our scrub. 
How long before I see results?
Immediately. No we're not kidding, your skin will feel incredibly smooth right after using this scrub and a lovely scent will linger. Apply 2-3 times a week and you will see results or your money back. 
Is getting Dirtea good for sensitive skin?
Yes, try patch testing first before you rub it all over just to make sure you don't irritate your sensitive side. The majority will have no problem with this scrub but be extra gentle on your face. 
Is getting Dirtea good for oily skin?
Yes again, oil absorbs oil. Woah that's pretty darn cool. Use a body wash to rinse off any excess oil and you'll be good to go!
Is getting Dirtea good for combination skin?
Yes already! Getting Dirtea will take care of your whole body, no matter what skin type you are. There's no discrimination here. We still recommend patch testing your first application. And remember kids, don't eat anything Dirtea and don't get anything Dirtea in your eyes.
How Dirtea should I get?
As Dirtea as you want! Each container holds 7fl oz of body scrub good for an entire months worth use. 
How often should I get Dirtea?
We recommend 2-3 scrubs a week. Getting Dirtea is better in moderation.
Should I get Dirtea wet or dry?
We like damp skin - a happy medium. However if you would like a more intense treatment, Dirtea works well on dry skin too.
How long do I stay Dirtea before rinsing?
The key is to leave the scrub on for 5-10 minutes each time, this way the caffeine and antioxidants can be better absorbed into your skin.
Why is Dirtea dry?
Dirtea isn't like the other scrubs you might be used to. It's a dry scrub. If you prefer a wet scrub just add water.
Will getting Dirtea clog my drain?
Nope, the scrub is fine enough to wash down the drain. It's going to get a little messy though. It's good to get things Dirtea sometimes.
Which scrub is better?
We recommend getting the bundle if you can't decide! ;)  
What payment methods are accepted?
Visa. Mastercard. PayPal. American Express. Discover. 
How long does shipping take?
We ship USPS first class mail. Usually 3-4 days. And tracking information is provided. Worlwide shipping takes a little longer depending on customs but usually within a week. 
Will getting Dirtea stain my skin?
No. Your skin may look a little green or brown while you use it but the color will wash off right away. That fresh mint, coconut, or lemon scent (whichever scrub you choose) will linger.
What if I get Dirtea in my eyes?
Wash it out babe. Keep this scrub out of your eyes. If this occurs rinse thoroughly. If irritation occurs, discontinue use and seek medical assistance. Unlikely so hey, stay positive. 
Can I get Dirtea on my face?
If you have sensitive skin, be gentle. Dirtea can be a coarse exfoliator for some and the skin on your face is delicate. If you want to use it on your face, test first, and use a soap free cleanser to wash off any excess oil.
I'm pregnant, can I still get Dirtea?
Hey beautiful mamma to be. As much as we want to get Dirtea with you, we recommend you consult your doctor before you start using our scrub. Dirtea does have a high caffeine content as well as peppermint oil, so some ladies choose to wait and use Dirtea after they have their babe. However, if you are still drinking tea/coffee it shouldn't be an issue.
How long will getting Dirtea last?
Dirtea scrubs have a shelf life of nine months.

<p>Mason was born on January 22nd,
2013. He is our second born son and has the proudest big brother Tanner who is
7 years of age. Mason appeared to be like any other healthy 37 week newborn and
we brought him home full of joy. Within 6 days of being home Mason had to go to
the ER, which was the first of many visits. </p>
<p> 
Countless doctors’ visits, ER visits, hospitalizations, IV antibiotics,
Spinal taps, injections of strong antibiotics week after week, the strongest
oral antibiotics possible because others just wouldn’t work. Numerous specialists , and lots of blood work but still no answers. We knew this was
not normal and something was wrong with our baby. Chronic cough, asthma,
reflux, small seizures, low muscle tone, and ventral hernia (that may need to
be repaired), his spleen has been enlarged for over a year now, the list seems
to keep growing. </p>
<p>  In December
2013 Mason was diagnosed with a genetic primary immune deficiency (PID) called
MBL deficiency. He was started on prophylactic antibiotics twice a day long
term and will need to have his ear tubes replaced soon to try to cut back on respiratory
and ear infections, in hopes of lessening the harsh antibiotics. As time went
on, he continued to get very sick, infections still overlapping one another and
the doctors continued to fight to get us answers. It seemed as if the
respiratory stuff improved slightly but that he appeared to be getting viruses
that were going into bacterial infections.</p>
<p>  In December
of 2014, exactly a year later, they found he was born with another very rare PID called
Natural Killer (NK) Cell Deficiency, which makes him vulnerable to potentially fatal
infections and cancer. Dr. Orange, an immunologist and researcher at Texas Children's
Hospital, estimates that around 75 people worldwide have a true NK cell
deficiency. Currently, there is no specific treatment, but the treatment
focuses to cure infections associated with the disorder.  Mason
cannot receive live vaccines. No varicella or MMR vaccines, if he ever received
the vaccines they could be fatal to him as he could contract the illness. He
relies on herd immunity for protection.</p>
<p>  Mason was
started on antivirals three times a day, to try to prevent certain types of viral infections that could cause  causing serious lifelong problems. If he does contract specific
viruses, such as herpes type viruses (chicken pox, cmv, hsv) or mono for
example, he may not be able to fight them off. 
Antivirals do not protect against all viruses and that is why mason has recurrent
viral infections. His cells ignore the virus instead of fighting like they
should. Any time Mason has a fever for several days, we have to run blood tests
to make sure the virus has not gone into the blood stream. Antivirals are
beneficial but can cause anemia since he’s on prophylactic antibiotics as well, which
requires frequent labs, but that is something he is, unfortunately, used too.</p>
<p>  NK cells are
produced in the bone marrow. His doctors said this deficiency could be an
underlying sign of a much more serious immune disorder. Each test is a few thousand dollars and we are
responsible for 20% of that cost for each test ran. Depending on the genetic
results, the treatment could be bone marrow or stem cell transplant, or there could
be no cure at all. So you can see how important it is, that we get answers, or
rule out some of the bad stuff at least. We are also working with the Immune
deficiency foundation, to get more researchers interested, to fight for a cure.</p>
<p>  Dr. Orange has
reviewed Mason’s labs and wants to see him, he said he feels like he can help Mason. Our first appointment is
August 31st so we are flying out to Texas Childrens Hospital. Mason will be entered into his
research program and have  full exome sequencing studies done to try to find the gene that has caused
his NK cell deficiency. As of now, insurance has denied everything including
any testing he wants done before we go out there, but we are hopeful that it
will be covered. Genetic testing is very expensive. This one test alone, that
has been ordered and denied by our insurance so far, is around $20,000. If
insurance does not help, it will limit what studies we can do. We have been
told wonderful things about Dr. Orange and that he is definitely who we need to
see, if we have any chance at answers it will be through him. . Tanner will
also have to be tested for NK cell deficiency since it is genetic. He gets well
like a normal child but he does get really sick when he catches things, we were
told he could be a carrier. We are thankful to have a great doctor that wants
to help. </p>
<p>Mason has a great team of doctors,
near and far, that really care about him, and want the same as we do, for him
to be healthy. As his parents, we see him up at night coughing until he throws
up, sleeping more than usual or not touching his food. What others see is a
wild playful little boy who loves life to the fullest and we would not have it
any other way. We are thankful he can enjoy life, things could always be worse.
Mason catches everything, so we have to be very careful. Unfortunately with
both of us working full time to carry insurance and make ends meet, Mason has
to go to daycare 1-2 days a week sometimes and that's a nightmare as you can
tell. We have been told he should not be in daycare at all. But it is not an option. We’ve tried a homecare, but with
big brother in school, the illnesses were still brought home; tried isolating
him or making him wear a mask when out in public, but he was still sick. Family
has been wonderful in taking him when they can, but it only takes one day for
him to catch something. </p>
<p>  We both
work full time, and we work hard. We never wanted to make a site for help with
Masons medical costs, but family and friends are asking us to, so they can
offer to help. We are trying not to see it as a sign of weakness, but it’s for
our son, he deserves it! With an ongoing
illness its hard balancing work and normal, everyday bills with the high
medical bills for the last 2 and a half years. The boys truly deserve a some what normal
life like other children, they are the sweetest boys, with the biggest hearts.</p>
<p>  We were able to
raise $2300 with a benefit with the help of family, friends and the community, and we feel so blessed and so beyond thankful to each and every person! Unfortunately as you can tell, that is only a fraction of the costs already accumulated. Any money raised
will be put in an account specifically for Mason to help with ongoing medical
expenses: for travel/gas to his multiple specialist appointments , each doctor is  1.5 to
3 hours away, medications (his inhalers are $110), surgeries a minimum of $900,
genetic testing, hospital stays around $400, ER visits $150, labs, xrays, etc.,
missed work for when he's ill, and the initial Texas trips costing around
$20,000 because of testing that is needed and future trips for follow up care, plane tickets are $700 plus hotel
cost, food, and rental car. We are hopeful that we will get to stay at Ronald McDonald house
but we will not know until the day of arrival.</p>
<p>We appreciate everything, Prayers, or spreading the word to help raise awareness, is a huge blessing for our sweet Mason. Thank you, to all of you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
<p>Thank you for the continued prayers and any help provided! God
Bless,</p>

<p><b>ASD Prati 2000</b> è
una storica Società di Pallavolo femminile, nata a Roma nel 1996 ed oggi attiva
a Sacrofano, alle porte della città.</p>
<p>Una Società ed
un gruppo di ragazze e bambine appassionate e vincenti: nell'ultima Stagione infatti la nostra Prima Squadra - <i><b>l'Invincibile</b></i><b>!</b>
- ha ottenuto l'incredibile Record di vincere tutte le partite del Campionato,
accedendo così alla <b>Serie D</b>, mentre le bambine e ragazze delle altre Categorie si
classificavano tutte nei primi posti dei rispettivi Campionati.</p>
<p>Ma la nostra più
grande soddisfazione è di riuscire a dare alle nostre <b>60 tesserate</b> - piccole e
grandi - una Passione che le aiuti a crescere all'insegna di valori sani.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b></b></h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444666013/wkaxgyrv01jh4awrnaeg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>L'incredibile
risultato delle ""Invincibili"" della Prima Squadra e delle altre
ragazze è stato raggiunto in condizioni a dir poco difficili.</p>
<p>Ci alleniamo
infatti  in una <b>palestra fatiscente</b>, priva di ogni
requisito minimo, con le pareti a 20 centimentri dalle linee di bordo campo ed
il soffitto poco più alto della rete e senza acqua calda per le docce.</p>
<p>Per giocare le partite dei vari Campionati, abbiamo dovuto affittare il campo di Castelnuovo campi (a oltre 15 km di distanza), essendo appunto il nostro campo <b>non
regolamentare</b>.</p>
<p>Nonostante queste difficoltà abbiamo
combattutto tutte insieme e abbiamo vinto (o quasi) tutti i nostri tornei !</p>
<p>Ma da questa
stagione, <b>le cose si complicano!</b></p>
<p>Il Comune di
Sacrofano aumenterà il Canone di Affitto della Palestra (non a norma!) in cui
ci alleniamo e - per le partite - 
il campo di Castelnuovo non sarà più disponibile.</p>
<p>Inoltre le nuove
norme impongono, giustamente, la dotazione di un defibrillatore anche nei campi
di allenamento e senza questo non potremo più nemmeno allenarci.</p>
<p><b>Cosi rischiamo di
smettere! Tutte e 60, sia le grandi che le piccole </b></p><p>E di interrompere il sano sogno delle <i>Invincibili</i> di giocare in Serie D
e di togliere alle 60 ragazze e bambine delle altre Categorie la loro passione.</p>
<p>Ma noi vogliamo combattere
tutto questo sul campo, come siamo abituate a fare!</p>
<p><b>E' per questo
che chiediamo il vostro supporto.</b></p>

<p>E' di permettere

<p>E' di permettere
alle ragazze e bambine delle Categorie inferiori di migliorarsi ancora e
provare anche loro ad imitare le Invincibili.</p>
<p>E' di permettere

alle nostre bambine e ragazze di continuare a primeggiare nei rispettivi
Campionati e a pensare che i grandi credano nell'esempio dello Sport e nei suoi valori e stili di vita sani, abbiamo bisogno di poche fondamentali cose, il cui <b>costo complessivo è di circa 11.600€</b>:</p>
<p>Il <b>Canone di
affitto della Palestra</b> che il Comune di Sacrofano ci mette a disposizione per
gli allenamenti ed i costi di manutenzione: circa 2.900€</p>
<p>L'affitto del <b>Campo PalaLUISS</b> di Roma, dove dovremo giocare le partite in <b>Serie D</b> della Prima
Squadra: circa 1.400€</p>
<p>L'affitto del Campo per poter giocare le partite dei <b>Campionati delle Under 13 e Under
14</b>: circa 1.200€ </p>
<p>Un <b>Defibrillatore</b> e relativi corsi di formazione, obbligatori per legge da
quest'anno anche durante gli allenamenti: circa 1.500 €</p>
<p>L'Acqua Calda
per le docce: <b>Caldaia + Installazione</b>, e ripristino dell'impianto idraulico: circa 1.800 € </p>
<p>Le risorse per
dotare tutte le ragazze e bambine di <b>Materiale Tecnico</b> adeguato - fino ad oggi
la retta permetteva di fornire solo le magliette - ovvero tuta, borse,
magliette, pantaloncini, sostituzione palloni da allenamento e rete: circa 2.800

è di regalare alle nostre bambine e ragazze una normalità speciale. </p>
<p>Ecco perchè
abbiamo già molto chiari gli impieghi dei fondi che raccoglieremo oltre
l'obiettivo di 11.600€</p>
<p>Con la raccolta ulteriore rispetto a 11.600€, creeremo un Fondo Vincolato
per la realizzazione del <b>Nuovo
Palazzetto Sportivo</b> presso il Comune di Sacrofano, per il quale esiste già
sia il terreno che il Progetto Esecutivo, ma mancano del tutto i fondi

</div></div>","ASD Prati 2000 è
una storica Società di Pallavolo femminile, nata a Roma nel 1996 ed oggi attiva
a Sacrofano, alle porte della città.
Una Società ed
un gruppo di ragazze e bambine appassionate e vincenti: nell'ultima Stagione infatti la nostra Prima Squadra - l'Invincibile!
- ha ottenuto l'incredibile Record di vincere tutte le partite del Campionato,
accedendo così alla Serie D, mentre le bambine e ragazze delle altre Categorie si
classificavano tutte nei primi posti dei rispettivi Campionati.
Ma la nostra più
grande soddisfazione è di riuscire a dare alle nostre 60 tesserate - piccole e
grandi - una Passione che le aiuti a crescere all'insegna di valori sani.

L'incredibile
risultato delle ""Invincibili"" della Prima Squadra e delle altre
ragazze è stato raggiunto in condizioni a dir poco difficili.
Ci alleniamo
infatti  in una palestra fatiscente, priva di ogni
requisito minimo, con le pareti a 20 centimentri dalle linee di bordo campo ed
il soffitto poco più alto della rete e senza acqua calda per le docce.
Per giocare le partite dei vari Campionati, abbiamo dovuto affittare il campo di Castelnuovo campi (a oltre 15 km di distanza), essendo appunto il nostro campo non
regolamentare.
Nonostante queste difficoltà abbiamo
combattutto tutte insieme e abbiamo vinto (o quasi) tutti i nostri tornei !
Ma da questa
stagione, le cose si complicano!
Il Comune di
Sacrofano aumenterà il Canone di Affitto della Palestra (non a norma!) in cui
ci alleniamo e - per le partite - 
il campo di Castelnuovo non sarà più disponibile.
Inoltre le nuove
norme impongono, giustamente, la dotazione di un defibrillatore anche nei campi
di allenamento e senza questo non potremo più nemmeno allenarci.
Cosi rischiamo di
smettere! Tutte e 60, sia le grandi che le piccole E di interrompere il sano sogno delle Invincibili di giocare in Serie D
e di togliere alle 60 ragazze e bambine delle altre Categorie la loro passione.
Ma noi vogliamo combattere
tutto questo sul campo, come siamo abituate a fare!
E' per questo
che chiediamo il vostro supporto.

Il nostro
obiettivo è di permettere che la ASD Prati2000 continui ad esistere, nonostante
tutto.
E' di permettere
all'Invincibile, la nostra grande Prima Squadra di vincerle ancora tutte, anche in Serie D.
E' di permettere
alle ragazze e bambine delle Categorie inferiori di migliorarsi ancora e
provare anche loro ad imitare le Invincibili.
E' di permettere
alle nostre 60 tesserate di continuare a fare con entusiasmo e passione il loro
Sport preferito, invece di passare i loro pomeriggi ""sul muretto"".
Per permettere
alle nostre bambine e ragazze di continuare a primeggiare nei rispettivi
Campionati e a pensare che i grandi credano nell'esempio dello Sport e nei suoi valori e stili di vita sani, abbiamo bisogno di poche fondamentali cose, il cui costo complessivo è di circa 11.600€:
Il Canone di
affitto della Palestra che il Comune di Sacrofano ci mette a disposizione per
gli allenamenti ed i costi di manutenzione: circa 2.900€
L'affitto del Campo PalaLUISS di Roma, dove dovremo giocare le partite in Serie D della Prima
Squadra: circa 1.400€
L'affitto del Campo per poter giocare le partite dei Campionati delle Under 13 e Under
14: circa 1.200€ 
Un Defibrillatore e relativi corsi di formazione, obbligatori per legge da
quest'anno anche durante gli allenamenti: circa 1.500 €
L'Acqua Calda
per le docce: Caldaia + Installazione, e ripristino dell'impianto idraulico: circa 1.800 € 
Le risorse per
dotare tutte le ragazze e bambine di Materiale Tecnico adeguato - fino ad oggi
la retta permetteva di fornire solo le magliette - ovvero tuta, borse,
magliette, pantaloncini, sostituzione palloni da allenamento e rete: circa 2.800
€Obiettivo e Impiego dei Finanziamenti ulterioriIl nostro sogno
è di regalare alle nostre bambine e ragazze una normalità speciale. 
Ecco perchè
abbiamo già molto chiari gli impieghi dei fondi che raccoglieremo oltre
l'obiettivo di 11.600€
Con la raccolta ulteriore rispetto a 11.600€, creeremo un Fondo Vincolato
per la realizzazione del Nuovo
Palazzetto Sportivo presso il Comune di Sacrofano, per il quale esiste già
sia il terreno che il Progetto Esecutivo, ma mancano del tutto i fondi
necessari per la realizzazione.Ci piace darci obiettivi ambiziosi e raggiungerli: per questo sogniamo di arrivare a 150.000€, per raccogliere i fondi necessari per creare - nel nostro Comune - una sportiva adeguata e utile per tutti gli Sport e la nostra Comunità, in particolare per aprire le porte del nostro Sport anche ai Diversamente Abili e alla Terza Età.Per realizzare NOI quello che dovrebbero fare gli ALTRI


Chi aiuterà
SCHIACCIA! potrà dimostrare insieme a noi che - anche quando mancano le cose
essenziali - si può raggiungere l'obiettivo di aiutare un gruppo di ragazze e
bambine a realizzare il proprio sano sogno
Noi in cambio

</div> <div> <h3>Our dangerous neighbours - bacteria<br/>
</h3>  Did you know that every 60 seconds, a worker comes into contact with 
more than 30 objects that may be contaminated with bacteria or viruses 
that cause infectious diseases?
According to the latest studies it was found that the surface of a 
desktop, computer keyboards, a mouse, or  telephone handset are the main
 carriers of harmful bacteria, because people touch them more often.  
They are in fact more polluted than the toilet seat in the bathroom. <br/>  London scientists scanned 33 keyboards and revealed that four of them 
are a potential health hazard, while  one had five times as many germs 
as a toilet seat in the bathroom of the same institution.
During the tests, which were conducted in January, one of the experts 
participating in the study,  sent a keyboard selected at random,  for 
analysis.
It was found that the number of bacteria on it exceeds the maximum 
acceptable limit by 150 times.
Researchers say that the cause of this state of the keyboard is that 
people often eat while working on their computer and bits of food fall 
in between the keys, which then become infested with microbes.
Another reason is the failure to comply with the elementary rules of 
hygiene, in particular, the need to wash  your hands after using the 
toilet.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441822004/wonvxaqeqovvewniajel.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div>","Who we are?We are people, who like cleanliness. That's why we think that all of our supporters will want to have a such device which can help you to  get rid of bacteria.










  Our dangerous neighbours - bacteria
  Did you know that every 60 seconds, a worker comes into contact with 
more than 30 objects that may be contaminated with bacteria or viruses 
that cause infectious diseases?
According to the latest studies it was found that the surface of a 
desktop, computer keyboards, a mouse, or  telephone handset are the main
 carriers of harmful bacteria, because people touch them more often.  
They are in fact more polluted than the toilet seat in the bathroom.   London scientists scanned 33 keyboards and revealed that four of them 
are a potential health hazard, while  one had five times as many germs 
as a toilet seat in the bathroom of the same institution.
During the tests, which were conducted in January, one of the experts 
participating in the study,  sent a keyboard selected at random,  for 
analysis.
It was found that the number of bacteria on it exceeds the maximum 
acceptable limit by 150 times.
Researchers say that the cause of this state of the keyboard is that 
people often eat while working on their computer and bits of food fall 
in between the keys, which then become infested with microbes.
Another reason is the failure to comply with the elementary rules of 
hygiene, in particular, the need to wash  your hands after using the 
toilet.



   




But how can you protect yourself from this attack of microbes? Is it possible to get rid of these dangerous creatures?
Now there is a solution,  its called  «BakterKiller».    BakterKiller - 
is a unique device that kills 99.9% more bacteria, can you imagine?!  
Now there is no need to worry while working on your computer or using 
the phone or even public doorknobs – now you can get rid of these 
dangerous bacteria that destroy one’s health and general wellbeing.  
There is no need now to worry that when your child goes to the computer 
to look for a cartoon, he or she will start sneezing from allergies.  
Now there is no need to be concerned that some virus or bacteria will 
impact your health and cause some diseases. 











What you can do with BakterKiller and how it is useful: 

• Suitable for households, travel, business, healthcare industries. It's easy to bring and use. 


•
 Ultraviolet  light helps to eliminate bacteria, viruses, fungus, mold, 
etc,  on the surfaces of most household and personal items. Remove 
doors, bacteria, and dust mites which cause splenitis, pneumonia, 
asthma, and allegies. 


• Maintain room and cupboard cleanliness, with household products to keep thingsclean, and so  avoid the growth of bacteria. 



• Portable clamshell design: space saving, to sterilize the required area at any time. 


• Simple operation easy to press power button.


• With  protection (safety switch), it will automatically turn the UV-C light off if the device is turned upward. 



• Products used in daily life, such as chopsticks, spoons, dishes, 
telephone handsets, desk, toilets, public places, doorknobs, 
automobiles, etc, - be sure to keep them all free from harmful bacterial
 pathogens. Keep your rooms, closets and household appliances in a “Germ
 Free”  healthy environment.

This is covert violence that makes us commit heinous acts, whether towards others or towards ourselves. On the surface, unproductive haywire passions and lack of insight and control do not appear all that bad. However, when considered in their public manifestations, they are part of suppressive campaigns that use force to achieve damaging ends. Failure of gun control regulations, open ended conflict in the Middle East, and illegal immigration are just a few examples. A desensitized culture renders us unable to confront the problem. This project supports a healthy civic order by uncovering and identifying causes of violence as they relate to what matters most to our cultural and national identity: national security, immigration, and foreign relations, to name a few.

</div></div>","Art is about responsibility. Violence is caused by suppression. The crucial life supporting elements that are damaged belong to the person or are located in his or her environment. This project identifies and seeks to cure the causes of violence worldwide. 



When suppression desensitizes culture to violence, popular perception becomes skewed and focuses on those aspects that elicit grief and fear. This is covert violence that makes us commit heinous acts, whether towards others or towards ourselves. On the surface, unproductive haywire passions and lack of insight and control do not appear all that bad. However, when considered in their public manifestations, they are part of suppressive campaigns that use force to achieve damaging ends. Failure of gun control regulations, open ended conflict in the Middle East, and illegal immigration are just a few examples. A desensitized culture renders us unable to confront the problem. This project supports a healthy civic order by uncovering and identifying causes of violence as they relate to what matters most to our cultural and national identity: national security, immigration, and foreign relations, to name a few. Please visit our project page for more details. 

Project collaborators have first hand experience with the political and social problems that mask root causes. ISIS, to provide just one example, is not just a bunch of weirdos but, unacceptably, an organized group that has pushed through a highly specific vision and political agenda. It takes a specific technology to break down a culture to the extent that it is willing to absorb destructive and sickening news story after news story, none of which contributes to a real understanding of the problem. 

Project contributors have the unique opportunity to correct and set straight a lack of information, or an abundance of false information, that thwarts popular perception and confuses the virtues of liberalism with the dead-end self-indulgence of violence. Yet once causes are identified, it does not take much to help everyone live in a world that is safer and more secure. Getting there however does take much, given the abundance of disinformation, and it is here that your support is required.

We need your contribution in order to fund the basic operations of this public policy and publication platform.  
WHERE DO THE FUNDS GO (a year) ?
Please note that these are the basic minimum lowest amounts.
Office space and computer                            $5,000.00
Book production costs                                     $3,000.00
Indiegogo platform and payment fees        $4,000.00
Advertising fees                                                  $5,500.00
Other advocacy publications printing, 

copying, distribution costs                             $4,000.00

Basic salary for a full-time writer,
researcher, event coordinator, and
public relations person                                 $28,500.00

                                                                              $50,000.00 TOTAL   

For just $150 a year, or a paltry $12.50 a  month, you will get all publications and updates produced in that year. By comparison, the satisfaction from having contributed to making the world a safer and more secure place is tremendous.  

We are not playing games or making false promises. The real and accurate information to set the record straight when violence threatens to get the better part of our culture is out there; it is just a matter of doing the (considerable) work of identifying and assembling it, which is the vision and goal of the project creators.
A healthy civic order knows no borders. The freedom of conscience on which it is based is foundational to several modern Constitutions, in particular in countries, importantly beginning with the United States in 1788, in which freedom of religion has played a crucial founding role. Today, religious extremism magnifies the importance of protecting the fragile freedom of conscience on which the civic order is based. The paid professional scam artists that don the guise of religion in the Middle East and Africa are puppets that further high level hidden and corrupt political interests. Religious extremism eradicates the democratic process at its very root. Our goal is to eradicate religious extremism forever. Please visit our international page for more information.

</p><p> Finally a device designed and
made for people with a challenged immune system or a respiration problem such
as asthma, Copd, cronic bronchitis and others . You can use this device in
situations of a confined air space  shared with others such as an airplane, train,
bus, car and even the doctor’s waiting room. The device can protect you or
others from you at times when you may have a respiratory illness. </p>
<p>The device is a
self-adjusting face mask with a patent applied no-leak soft bladder which
solves the major problem of face masks, leakage around the edges. The situation
is so bad that people who use face masks in the work regimen must undergo an
expensive and time consuming fit- test yearly to check and try to correct these
leakages. With this mask the user can conveniently self adjust. insuring no
leakage and adequate  operation. When
fully exploited and in volume production this mask will protect from airborne
bacterial and viral pathogens and sell for slightly under $20. We are asking
for help in expediting this development.</p>

Respirators

<h1><b>PROJECT SUMMARY</b></h1>
<p> Respirators
are commonly used for protection against TB, Influenza, Bacteria, SARS and
other airborne pathogens.  There are over 5.1 million Medical, Industrial, EMS and similar users of conventional
respirators in the US.  Since the largest problem with these devices is <b>face seal leakage</b>. ProReactive LLC of
Lansing, Mi has developed a patent pending respirator which virtually
eliminates this critical issue through an inflated face seal bladder system. </p>
<p>The
ProReactive respirator further protects users by integrating state of

protection from airborne pathogens such as H1N1, Avian and the Swine flu
virus. </p>
<p>This new
technology has the added benefit of potentially reducing or eliminating costly
mandatory workplace respirator fit testing. The low cost
replaceable filter and the application of disinfectant procedures on
the re-usable face mask housing will substantially reduce the ongoing expense <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and </span>provide<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> levels of improved protection for employees and the general public. Additionally, the </span>multiple <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">use of the Proreactive mask by a single user will reduce the cost</span> to<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> healthcare facility, EMS, public safety </span>departments<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, or similar organizations</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px;""> in preparation for a pandemic.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/>               </span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>MARKET ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p>Research has shown
the following market statistics:</p>
<p>Over five million
American workers are required to wear respirators to protect themselves from
hazards in their workplace. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The current market
for a popular N95 respirator (typically disposable) of the type in contrast to the
ProReactive face mask in the United States is at 900 million units annually, the majority
of which are used in a non-medical setting. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Department of
Health and Human Services is intent on both stockpiling as well as increasing
the production of N95 respirators.  The
United States would reportedly need approximately 5.3 billion disposable respirators
during a pandemic situation, only 0.2 percent of which is currently available. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There are
regulatory bodies governing the devices in the target markets and these
agencies have spent considerable effort driving improved product performance
with workshops on design improvements for fit testing, user comfort
enhancement, and filtration media optimization. 
Fit testing is a required annual process that assures that a given
respirator fits the individual user.  Although
fit testing costs hospitals and others millions of dollars each year in
man-hours, equipment, and training, it is still mandated due to conventional
product leakage and is critical to protecting the user. </span></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p>The
Institute of Medicine states what the design drivers for effective PPE are, and t<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">he ProReactive
product exceeds these drivers by providing the following</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> factors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved protection due to face
     seal leakage elimination, and using new technology filter material</li>
<li>The Proreactive face mask will have the ability for the user to do their own fit test ( See Video)</li>
<li>Improved user comfort due to
     inflatable seal system</li>
<li>Reduction in cost due to fit
     testing elimination </li>
<li>Improved compliance with worker
     health regulations due to dramatically improved protection from airborne
     pathogens and other pollutants.</li>
<li>The ability to cool or heat the Proreactive face mask depending on the users needs</li>
<li>The first phase proreactive face mask's will be made of clear virgin polymers so that the users face will be visible to patients and others</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Healthcare
Market:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Healthcare is one of the
     fastest growing markets in the World and will be on the front
     lines delivering care and reducing the spread of any future epidemics and pandemics</li>
<li>Currently, there are over 7,500 US hospitals employing more than 5.1 million workers</li>
<li>The job outlook for registered
     nurses alone is expected to climb by 22 percent from 2008 to 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Government
(epidemic preparedness) Market:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Centers for Disease Control
     and Prevention estimates that at least 40% of the US population will be
     exposed to either H1N1 or H5N1 viruses</li>
<li>The Department of Health and
     Human Services reports that the US needs approximately 5.3 billion
     respirators stockpiled during an epidemic/pandemic and only 0.2 percent of that
     total is currently available</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Individual
User Market:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 50 million
     Americans suffer from asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema.  These people represent a high risk
     category for infection from airborne pathogens</li>
<li>Approximately 70 percent of
     people who were hospitalized in 2009 due to the H1N1 virus had one or more
     medical conditions previously recognized as placing these people at “high risk”
     of serious flu-related complications.</li>
<li>In the event of an influenza epidemic/pandemic, retail purchase may play an important role in acquiring PPE
     (personal protection equipment) for home healthcare workers as well as the
     general public who would be caring for friends and family members</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>BUSINESS MODEL</h3>
<p>ProReactive
will generate revenue from both manufacturing  and
proprietary replacement filters sales through wholesale distribution
channels. Licensing of the design rights to clients in non-North American markets is under consideration. A PCT has been filed to ensure
foreign rights are appropriately retained for the licensing activity.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Revenue from Production: </b></p>
<p>Revenue
from North American production will be generated for each market segment as follows:</p>
<p><b>Healthcare:</b></p>
<p>Our first strategy is to open the door into the massive
healthcare industry where there is a significant need for a new and improved
respiratory mask.  With the improvements
and the cost savings that this product will offer, we will take advantage of
the many contacts that have already made. 
NIOSH/CDC approval will be vital to attain this goal as they approve almost
everything sold within the hospital market for PPE. These sales will occur through both
DME agents and organizations for nurse practitioners, Wonks, RN's and other hospital staff. Independent practitioners in the medical field such as Doctors,Dentists, etc. have been contacted with favorable responses. </p>
<p><b>Police and First
Responders:</b></p>
<p>The next market to enter would be police and
first-responders, as there are many uses for our product in these areas.  These individuals need better protection in
their daily work duties when needed in the event of  an infectious decease out brake, unexpected Chemical releases and actions of bioterrorism.  Sales to
these agencies will be through direct agency leader solicitation.  Favorable contacts have already been established
with the Michigan State Police and a contingent order will be sought. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Military:</b></p>
<p>With 3 million active and reserve military personnel, the
Department of Defense could become a substantial buyer of ProReactive masks and
filter’s. Specific applications and contacts have been made.  Informal testing has been done in a military environment with favorable results.  </p>
<p><b>Industrial:</b></p>
<p>The next market to enter would be construction workers,
industrial laborers, welders and individuals doing various jobs while being exposer to potentially harmful inhalants.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Phase 3 will include a diagnostic evaluation of the used work site filter for chemical, metals and other materials in </span>optimizing<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> filter </span>performance.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Civilian<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> sector:</span></b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Individuals doing various work on home and gardening projects who may want to reduce the intake of seasonal allergens , pollen, dust and other irritants. </span>Obviously persons with respiration problems would purchase our produce on basis of their need.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Travel:</b></p>
<p>2.5 Million people travel by air in the USA daily. O<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">thers versions of close </span>proximity<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> mass transit are Subways, Busses and ships. In all cases there is a common air volume. Many of these persons may have </span>respiratory issues and would like the protection and ease of mind.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Revenue Growth Projections</b></p>

For
North American Production, the initial orders will be taken as contingent upon NIOSH
certification. The NIOSH certification process
will take less than 3 months.  Then in Q4 2015  A limited number of units will be produced and distributed.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> By Q1  of 2016 </span>production<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and </span>distribution<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> will be increasing at a rate dependent on capital availability.</span>

</div>","Finally a device designed and
made for people with a challenged immune system or a respiration problem such
as asthma, Copd, cronic bronchitis and others . You can use this device in
situations of a confined air space  shared with others such as an airplane, train,
bus, car and even the doctor’s waiting room. The device can protect you or
others from you at times when you may have a respiratory illness. 
The device is a
self-adjusting face mask with a patent applied no-leak soft bladder which
solves the major problem of face masks, leakage around the edges. The situation
is so bad that people who use face masks in the work regimen must undergo an
expensive and time consuming fit- test yearly to check and try to correct these
leakages. With this mask the user can conveniently self adjust. insuring no
leakage and adequate  operation. When
fully exploited and in volume production this mask will protect from airborne
bacterial and viral pathogens and sell for slightly under $20. We are asking
for help in expediting this development.

Respirators
are commonly used for protection against TB, influenza, bacteria,  and
other airborne pathogens.  There are over 5 million Medical, Industrial, EMS and similar users of conventional
respirators in the US. Approximately 50 million
     Americans suffer from asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema.  These people represent a high risk
     category for infection from airborne pathogens and they are often unable to effectively fight the ensuing distress.The Institute of
Medicine has reported that the largest problem with these devices is face seal leakage. ProReactive LLC of
Lansing, MI has developed a patent pending respirator which virtually
eliminates this critical issue through an adjustable, inflatable face seal bladder system. 
The
ProReactive respirator further protects users by integrating state of
the art nano-filtration media which allow for previously unobtainable
protection from airborne pathogens such as H1N1, Avian, Swine flu and other viruses.
This new technology has the added benefit of potentially reducing or eliminating
costly mandatory workplace respirator fit testing. The low cost
replaceable filter  and the application of disinfectants on
the re-usable face mask body will substantially reduce the ongoing expense and provide improved  protection for employees. (For single person use) These cost reductions will greatly aid in the preparation for future pandemics by healthcare facility, EMS, public safety department or similar organization. 
WE NEED YOUR HELPOur goal is to raise funding to start producing this innovative item in Michigan and Ohio. This product is revolutionary, reusable and the lack of face mask leakage will make this one of the most effective products on the market. You can join in on the ground floor and be a part of this novel product that will not contribute to the millions of masks that are filling up landfills every day. Our disposable filter housings can be made of a bio-starch that is 99% biodegradable and will contribute little to these crowded landfills.

PROJECT SUMMARY
 Respirators
are commonly used for protection against TB, Influenza, Bacteria, SARS and
other airborne pathogens.  There are over 5.1 million Medical, Industrial, EMS and similar users of conventional
respirators in the US.  Since the largest problem with these devices is face seal leakage. ProReactive LLC of
Lansing, Mi has developed a patent pending respirator which virtually
eliminates this critical issue through an inflated face seal bladder system. 
The
ProReactive respirator further protects users by integrating state of
the art nano-filtration media which allows for previously unobtainable
protection from airborne pathogens such as H1N1, Avian and the Swine flu
virus. 
This new
technology has the added benefit of potentially reducing or eliminating costly
mandatory workplace respirator fit testing. The low cost
replaceable filter and the application of disinfectant procedures on
the re-usable face mask housing will substantially reduce the ongoing expense  and provide levels of improved protection for employees and the general public. Additionally, the multiple use of the Proreactive mask by a single user will reduce the cost to healthcare facility, EMS, public safety departments, or similar organizations in preparation for a pandemic.               


MARKET ANALYSIS
Research has shown
the following market statistics:
Over five million
American workers are required to wear respirators to protect themselves from
hazards in their workplace. The current market
for a popular N95 respirator (typically disposable) of the type in contrast to the
ProReactive face mask in the United States is at 900 million units annually, the majority
of which are used in a non-medical setting. The Department of
Health and Human Services is intent on both stockpiling as well as increasing
the production of N95 respirators.  The
United States would reportedly need approximately 5.3 billion disposable respirators
during a pandemic situation, only 0.2 percent of which is currently available. There are
regulatory bodies governing the devices in the target markets and these
agencies have spent considerable effort driving improved product performance
with workshops on design improvements for fit testing, user comfort
enhancement, and filtration media optimization. 
Fit testing is a required annual process that assures that a given
respirator fits the individual user.  Although
fit testing costs hospitals and others millions of dollars each year in
man-hours, equipment, and training, it is still mandated due to conventional
product leakage and is critical to protecting the user. 

The
Institute of Medicine states what the design drivers for effective PPE are, and the ProReactive
product exceeds these drivers by providing the following factors:

Improved protection due to face
     seal leakage elimination, and using new technology filter material
The Proreactive face mask will have the ability for the user to do their own fit test ( See Video)
Improved user comfort due to
     inflatable seal system
Reduction in cost due to fit
     testing elimination 
Improved compliance with worker
     health regulations due to dramatically improved protection from airborne
     pathogens and other pollutants.
The ability to cool or heat the Proreactive face mask depending on the users needs
The first phase proreactive face mask's will be made of clear virgin polymers so that the users face will be visible to patients and others

Healthcare
Market:

Healthcare is one of the
     fastest growing markets in the World and will be on the front
     lines delivering care and reducing the spread of any future epidemics and pandemics
Currently, there are over 7,500 US hospitals employing more than 5.1 million workers
The job outlook for registered
     nurses alone is expected to climb by 22 percent from 2008 to 2018.

Government
(epidemic preparedness) Market:

The Centers for Disease Control
     and Prevention estimates that at least 40% of the US population will be
     exposed to either H1N1 or H5N1 viruses
The Department of Health and
     Human Services reports that the US needs approximately 5.3 billion
     respirators stockpiled during an epidemic/pandemic and only 0.2 percent of that
     total is currently available

Individual
User Market:

Approximately 50 million
     Americans suffer from asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema.  These people represent a high risk
     category for infection from airborne pathogens
Approximately 70 percent of
     people who were hospitalized in 2009 due to the H1N1 virus had one or more
     medical conditions previously recognized as placing these people at “high risk”
     of serious flu-related complications.
In the event of an influenza epidemic/pandemic, retail purchase may play an important role in acquiring PPE
     (personal protection equipment) for home healthcare workers as well as the
     general public who would be caring for friends and family members


PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
         ProReactive's first phase product line will include the following
The complete  adult size respirator with
     Antibacterial 3.0 micron filter in production 

       Proreactive's second phase product line will include the following
Allergen and spore filter model: Allows asthmatics with allergy issues to attain filtration performance levels previously only provided in full face mask systems
Children's size and large adult size will be available 
Efficient antiviral filter's in production
        Proreactive's third phase product line will include the following 
Pre heating and cooling: models designed for
     COPD patients and others that will allow for relief in cold or hot environments 
Chemical or other pollutant filter allowing the industrial user to have a high preforming seal and convenient replacement filters 


BUSINESS MODEL
ProReactive
will generate revenue from both manufacturing  and
proprietary replacement filters sales through wholesale distribution
channels. Licensing of the design rights to clients in non-North American markets is under consideration. A PCT has been filed to ensure
foreign rights are appropriately retained for the licensing activity.

Revenue from Production: 
Revenue
from North American production will be generated for each market segment as follows:
Healthcare:
Our first strategy is to open the door into the massive
healthcare industry where there is a significant need for a new and improved
respiratory mask.  With the improvements
and the cost savings that this product will offer, we will take advantage of
the many contacts that have already made. 
NIOSH/CDC approval will be vital to attain this goal as they approve almost
everything sold within the hospital market for PPE. These sales will occur through both
DME agents and organizations for nurse practitioners, Wonks, RN's and other hospital staff. Independent practitioners in the medical field such as Doctors,Dentists, etc. have been contacted with favorable responses. 
Police and First
Responders:
The next market to enter would be police and
first-responders, as there are many uses for our product in these areas.  These individuals need better protection in
their daily work duties when needed in the event of  an infectious decease out brake, unexpected Chemical releases and actions of bioterrorism.  Sales to
these agencies will be through direct agency leader solicitation.  Favorable contacts have already been established
with the Michigan State Police and a contingent order will be sought. 

Military:
With 3 million active and reserve military personnel, the
Department of Defense could become a substantial buyer of ProReactive masks and
filter’s. Specific applications and contacts have been made.  Informal testing has been done in a military environment with favorable results.  
Industrial:
The next market to enter would be construction workers,
industrial laborers, welders and individuals doing various jobs while being exposer to potentially harmful inhalants. Phase 3 will include a diagnostic evaluation of the used work site filter for chemical, metals and other materials in optimizing filter performance.

Civilian sector:
Individuals doing various work on home and gardening projects who may want to reduce the intake of seasonal allergens , pollen, dust and other irritants. Obviously persons with respiration problems would purchase our produce on basis of their need.

Travel:
2.5 Million people travel by air in the USA daily. Others versions of close proximity mass transit are Subways, Busses and ships. In all cases there is a common air volume. Many of these persons may have respiratory issues and would like the protection and ease of mind.




Revenue Growth Projections

For
North American Production, the initial orders will be taken as contingent upon NIOSH
certification. The NIOSH certification process
will take less than 3 months.  Then in Q4 2015  A limited number of units will be produced and distributed. By Q1  of 2016 production and distribution will be increasing at a rate dependent on capital availability.

Our aim is to be your outlet for fitness. Our foundational idea is that fitness can be done at any-time, and anywhere. Our plan is to make fitness more relatable and to guide persons on how fitness can fit into any lifestyle. 

Where we are now
The current site[ relentlessfitnesspursuits.trainerize.com] is the first tier, and features online training with options for building strength, losing weight and sculpting muscles. To this, Relentless Fitness Pursuits seeks to add more options; like sport specific fitness, pregnancy plans and injury rehabilitation training. We ultimately want to create new and innovative hybrid programs like video-gamer fitness, or workouts tailored to your occupations (eg teacher fitness!).

</div></div>","Short Summary
 Hi, I'm Steve, I'm a software engineer from the UK, and now live in sunny Malaysia with my wife and two cheeky monkeys (or daughters as they're otherwise known)
Dengue is quite an important issue here in Malaysia, over 100,000 cases in 2014 and 200 deaths, and increasingly in many more parts of the world. 
No matter how hard you try there is always a mosquito bite or two that get through the bug spray and the nets. I'm sure you can imagine the worry when that happens.
So I decided to do something about it. I have created a system that will highlight active dengue cases to the user 




and allow them to add points of interest, so that they can see if dengue cases are shown near schools, or work. It also lets you mark the places that you have a mosquito bite.
Not only does this system give people the information they need to protect themselves, but will also build up real world data to be able to predict mosquito and dengue outbreaks in the future, meaning mosquito eradication resources can be better targeted for the benefit of everyone.   
What We Need & What You Get The first version of the system has been developed, you can even download the app and take a look for yourself  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accessdevicesasia.mosquitobite 
Now we need to start work on new features and really promoting the app to those that need it.
The money will be used to develop additional features, such as:



Real-time alerts when you enter areas with active dengue cases.

iPhone and Windows Phone versions of the app.
A free system for Health Officials to mark dengue cases.


Currently we have Malaysia and Singapore integrated, We want to expand that to the whole of South East Asia, India, Africa and South & North America.


With this funding we aim to add at least 3 additional countries to the service, and hopefully many more afterwards.



The Impact

 There are four strains of the Dengue virus, they each have their own quirks, but one thing that happens is if you build up immunity to one, you become weaker against the other three, making a second infection significantly more dangerous than the first, and the most vulnerable are children.
The more people are aware of what is happening around them, the more care they will take. Cases tend to appear in clusters, as mosquitoes bite the infected and go on to infect others. This image shows there are actually 28 cases all in one small area, probably the same apartment block



If people had the information that number could have been significantly reduced.
With your donation we can encourage usage of the app, and lower the dengue infection rate
I've been developing software for the last 20 years, and this is the first time, I've worked on something a really believe in, and have put the time and money into researching and creating this system over the last 6 months, and I'm quite proud of it. It's not perfect, but it is providing useful information to those that need it.

    Risks & Challenges The biggest risk is that the app doesn't get enough exposure, and gets lost amongst the hundreds of (scientifically proven not to work) mosquito repelling sound apps that fill the app stores.

You can still contribute towards its success because our campaign has now gone InDemand. All the perks are still active. The timetable for opening is that the building works will be completed during August and I will get the keys to the buiklding on or around the 22nd. I will then spend the next ten days furnishing the place and we will open to the public on Bank Holiday Tuesday. Our launch will start on the 29th September, which is St Michael's Day, and we have a number of activities planned for that week. I will post updates when it is confirmed what we are offering and when. Meanwhile, if you are interested in how the Centre came about, please read on!<br/><br/>On New Year's Eve 2014, a friend asked me, what goal would you set for 2015 if you knew just saying it would make it happen? Straight away I said ""I'd have my own therapy centre"". And then I thought ""Wherever did that come from?"" But I couldn't get it out of my head. This is a dream I've had since before I became a Reiki master in 2007: I want a centre run on holistic, spiritual, organic and ethical principles that helps people achieve their full potential. And I want it in Coventry. A few days later I found suitable premises. So I now have a great place, located about a mile from the city centre on Ball Hill, which is a really busy shopping street. <br/><br/>As you can see from the photos, the building has been completely gutted.
 The landlord has been an absolute diamond and has put new and bigger 
windows in, made sure the roof is properly insulated and doesn't leak, 
installed a shower and a kitchen - both of which were on my 
specification - and has created the rooms. There is a large room at the 
front of the building, about 5 metres square. This will be my own room 
and also the room that will be let to therapists on a sessional basis, 
and also where training courses will take place that need a couch. Two 
treatment rooms at the back of the building are about 4 metres by 3 
metres. These are suitable for couches or talk therapists. If therapists
 want to base themselves at the Centre on a residency basis, they will 
be able to make one of these rooms their own. Upstairs, where there were
 two rooms, there is now one large, light and airy room with a new velux
 window and plenty of storage. The landord will stop the refurb of the 
building at the point where it is up to modern standards but not 
personalised for my requirements: when I hand over my contribution, he 
will then instruct the builders to complete the building to my 
specification.<br/><br/>At every stage I've been amazed at the generosity of those around me - but not, unfortunately, at the readiness of the banks to help me. Having had 3 years of poor health and barely working, I don't have any capital and I don't have the accounts to get me a bank loan. Which is where you come in.</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I need £5000 to help to equip the Centre. <br/></p>
<p>I have already got some furniture of my own to go in there, which will part furnish one room. I've also applied for a Loan from the local Reinvestment Trust, who are set up to provide funding for businesses who can't normally access mainstream funding,  which will provide for the refurbishment of the building and some essential requirements such as licences and insurances, plus some basic furnishings for the Centre reception.<br/></p>
<p>I'd very much like to put in a stairlift for both floors, which will possibly cost £2000.</p>
<p>I'd also like to purchase an electronic therapy couch, so that my own couch (which is now 8 years old) can become a spare and used for training.</p>
<p>A Dyson vacuum cleaner will be purchased - £300.<br/></p>
<p>I have identified artworks by Coventry artists for the Centre, and I would like to be able to purchase these artworks myself. 4 different works have been earmarked, and they each cost £200 - £250. <br/></p>
<p>Therapeutic things like alkalising and filtering water fountains, salt lamps, daylight lamps have been identified but don't form part of the loan funding, so these would come out of this bid.<br/></p>
<p>If we don't get the entire £5,000, obviously choices will have to be 
made. The priority is, of course, the stair lift to enable those with 
mobility problems to access the Centre with the same ease as anyone 
else.<br/><br/>If we get more, we will be able to do more.  It is 
important to me that things are done properly, and the more money we 
get, the higher the standard of furnishings that can be provided.<br/></p>
<i><br/>So what is so different about The Amethyst Centre?</i><br/><br/>Quite simply, it will be unique in Coventry and Warwickshire. It will be the only centre run by a practising therapist, which will be fully staffed whenever there are therapists on site. This makes it a safe environment for therapists to practise from: it will also enable more people to get access to holistic therapies as there will be slots available for people who just want a quick dose of Reiki (for example) without having to book, and the staff will be able to handle enquiries promptly, and in a friendly manner. My vision is that it will be a place of refreshment for the body and soul and that means for those who work from there as well. And a further unique characteristic is the intention to create a community of therapists who work together and refer between each other. Think of it as a ""holistic therapy ward"" with different specialisms working together to help you become more healthy and improve your life.<br/><br/>I have been approached by a fair amount of training providers too, so we will be able to train people in subjects as diverse as Angelic Reiki, Intuitive Tarot, meditation and assertiveness. The education part of the centre may prove to be more important as time goes on, as healthcare in the UK becomes more chaotic and less capable, and as people take control of their own health and wellbeing.<br/><br/><b>The Impact of the Centre</b>
</div><div> <p>There are other similar centres in the local area, but they just seem to be set up by business people to hire out rooms and they don't have the same level of support for the therapists that the Amethyst Centre is aiming to provide. For the last 10 years I have been involved in hiring venues, working out of hired rooms and centres, and I have built up a database of ""what works"" and ""what doesn't"". That is why it is important to me to have the centre fully staffed when therapists are working there: it means that enquirers are dealt with in a professional manner, and that therapists are not interrupted when working with clients - and that's important.</p>
<p>The rooms will be adequately soundproofed, so that sound leakage is minimised. After all, the last thing you want when you are receiving a Reiki healing is for the consultation in the next room to be audible: it's not confidential and can be disturbing for both therapist and client.</p>
<p>Proper therapy training rooms, outside of a college environment, are few and far between, and I have already had enquiries from agencies wishing to offer accredited training in ear candling, angelic Reiki, reflexology and sports massage among other things.</p>
<p>Groups such as Positive Living, Law of Attraction, A Course in Miracles, meditation, yoga, Tai Chi, are all things that the Centre has space for.<br/></p>
<p>Obviously I can't do everything myself, although I'm quite aware that this project is my baby! So I will be recruiting people to help with the reception. I've already had an offer from a trainee nurse and Reiki practitioner to help out with the admin and systems. I'm also interested in recruiting apprentices. The one thing I will never ever do is use people on Government Workfare schemes. I detest these schemes and have campaigned against them for years. They go radically against my ethical stance, that ""the labourer is worthy of their hire"". So you can rest assured that you are supporting an organisation that is working to the highest ethical principles.</p>
<p>Personally, I want to build a business that will help the business community in Coventry, as well as helping improve the health of the city. I want a business that makes good use of my experience and expertise and that enables me to be a productive member of society while taking my disabilities into consideration (I have rheumatoid arthritis, among other things). And I want to prove to the doubters that it is possible to run a successful business with ethical principles, and alternative sources of funding.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I know that businesses take time to get off the ground. My cash flow forecast has taken all that into account, and the cash flow will be positive by the end of September. <br/></p>
<p>My existing business is Pandora's Box Healing, and as part of that I am a consultant for NYR Organic, Magnetix-wellness Jewellery, and I am also a wholesaler for Wikaniko. My plan is to use these businesses to support me until the Amethyst Centre is in a position for me to take money out of it. I am the sole director of the Amethyst Centre. I like being solely responsible!</p>
<p>My cash flow projections tell me the Centre will be self-funding at only 30% occupancy. This means there is a greater chance of success than if the Centre required more occupancy.<br/> </p>
<p>I have the help and support of several networking organisations in Coventry, and some of their members have indicated they will hire rooms from me.</p>
<p>I've had my own businesses now for over 20 years, one way or another. I've also taught Community Enterprise and Development for Warwick and Leicester Universities. That means I have a range of tools I can use to help me with the business - and a lot of contacts made over the years!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Maybe you're a therapist yourself? Would you like to hire a room from me? Prices start from £10 per hour, £35 per day/£20 per session, or £130 if you'd like to become resident at the Centre and have an input into furnishing your room.  Or would you like to run a training course at the Centre? I would do that on a 30/70 split, where the Centre takes 30% of the course fees leaving you with the rest.<br/><br/>Would you like to help me staff the Centre? A few hours a week is all I can offer you at the moment, but it's nice to have people to help out!<br/><br/><br/><br/>
</div></div>","The best news I have is that The Amethyst Centre will open on 1st September 2015! You can still contribute towards its success because our campaign has now gone InDemand. All the perks are still active. The timetable for opening is that the building works will be completed during August and I will get the keys to the buiklding on or around the 22nd. I will then spend the next ten days furnishing the place and we will open to the public on Bank Holiday Tuesday. Our launch will start on the 29th September, which is St Michael's Day, and we have a number of activities planned for that week. I will post updates when it is confirmed what we are offering and when. Meanwhile, if you are interested in how the Centre came about, please read on!On New Year's Eve 2014, a friend asked me, what goal would you set for 2015 if you knew just saying it would make it happen? Straight away I said ""I'd have my own therapy centre"". And then I thought ""Wherever did that come from?"" But I couldn't get it out of my head. This is a dream I've had since before I became a Reiki master in 2007: I want a centre run on holistic, spiritual, organic and ethical principles that helps people achieve their full potential. And I want it in Coventry. A few days later I found suitable premises. So I now have a great place, located about a mile from the city centre on Ball Hill, which is a really busy shopping street. As you can see from the photos, the building has been completely gutted.
 The landlord has been an absolute diamond and has put new and bigger 
windows in, made sure the roof is properly insulated and doesn't leak, 
installed a shower and a kitchen - both of which were on my 
specification - and has created the rooms. There is a large room at the 
front of the building, about 5 metres square. This will be my own room 
and also the room that will be let to therapists on a sessional basis, 
and also where training courses will take place that need a couch. Two 
treatment rooms at the back of the building are about 4 metres by 3 
metres. These are suitable for couches or talk therapists. If therapists
 want to base themselves at the Centre on a residency basis, they will 
be able to make one of these rooms their own. Upstairs, where there were
 two rooms, there is now one large, light and airy room with a new velux
 window and plenty of storage. The landord will stop the refurb of the 
building at the point where it is up to modern standards but not 
personalised for my requirements: when I hand over my contribution, he 
will then instruct the builders to complete the building to my 
specification.At every stage I've been amazed at the generosity of those around me - but not, unfortunately, at the readiness of the banks to help me. Having had 3 years of poor health and barely working, I don't have any capital and I don't have the accounts to get me a bank loan. Which is where you come in.  
What We Need & What You Get I need £5000 to help to equip the Centre. 
I have already got some furniture of my own to go in there, which will part furnish one room. I've also applied for a Loan from the local Reinvestment Trust, who are set up to provide funding for businesses who can't normally access mainstream funding,  which will provide for the refurbishment of the building and some essential requirements such as licences and insurances, plus some basic furnishings for the Centre reception.
I'd very much like to put in a stairlift for both floors, which will possibly cost £2000.
I'd also like to purchase an electronic therapy couch, so that my own couch (which is now 8 years old) can become a spare and used for training.
A Dyson vacuum cleaner will be purchased - £300.
I have identified artworks by Coventry artists for the Centre, and I would like to be able to purchase these artworks myself. 4 different works have been earmarked, and they each cost £200 - £250.

<h3>Meet the Xculpters, hair and beard sculptors.</h3>
</div><p>Men and women have long endeavored to tame their hair.</p>
<p>In the beginning, <b>combs were </b>made from bone, horn, ivory, wood and tortoise shell, followed by <b>brushes </b>with bristles made from pony, marten, goat, wild boar, mongoose, calf ear and polecat hair.</p>
<p>With the arrival of electricity, more silent <b>hair dryers </b>emerged with increasingly powerful air flow function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every year, hundreds of new designs are launched, but the basic principle is always the same: hot air is blown on hair, which becomes tousled and tangled if we don't use a brush or comb in the other hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have entered an era of progress and simplification. In our forever-changing world, SweetlisS SAS finally brings you <b>intelligent hair dryers </b>that offer the long-awaited combination of comb, brush and blow dryer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are proud to introduce our versatile <b>Xculpter Xity &amp; Wild </b>with their patented diffuser that dries, smoothes and styles hair.</p><div style=""text-align: justify;"">

<h3>Xculpter for Beards : New tool for new hair growth</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Recent fashion trends have brought men's facial hair back in style with short, long or coarse-haired beards.</p>
<p>Modern men are at a loss with their new hair growth given the lack of styling tools specifically intended to tame bushy beards.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Today, drying your beard hinges on acrobatic bravery, wielding a burning hot blow dryer in one hand and a brush or comb in the other.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are pleased to introduce our fashion-inspired <b>Xculpters, </b>which<b> </b>combine the efficiency of a comb, a brush and hair dryer.</p>

</p>
<p>Elisabeth used to be Hair salon manager and thought that hair tools were very complicated to use. While Jean Yves was an aeronautic engineer and worked on weapon and radar systems.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When these two love birds met, beauty won a crucial battle with their new XCULPTERS and SWEETLISS. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Currently the Company  Sweetliss is based in France near Paris with a spanish assembly plant.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Last April 2015, in the presence of Google Europe's Vice-President, Sweetliss took home an Oscar given by the President of the Paris Chamber of Commerce.</p>

</div></div>","Meet the Xculpters, hair and beard sculptors.
Men and women have long endeavored to tame their hair.
In the beginning, combs were made from bone, horn, ivory, wood and tortoise shell, followed by brushes with bristles made from pony, marten, goat, wild boar, mongoose, calf ear and polecat hair.
With the arrival of electricity, more silent hair dryers emerged with increasingly powerful air flow function.

Every year, hundreds of new designs are launched, but the basic principle is always the same: hot air is blown on hair, which becomes tousled and tangled if we don't use a brush or comb in the other hand.

We have entered an era of progress and simplification. In our forever-changing world, SweetlisS SAS finally brings you intelligent hair dryers that offer the long-awaited combination of comb, brush and blow dryer.

We are proud to introduce our versatile Xculpter Xity & Wild with their patented diffuser that dries, smoothes and styles hair.
Xity & Wild are Xculpters for Beards, short Hair and long Hair




Xculpter for Beards : New tool for new hair growth


Recent fashion trends have brought men's facial hair back in style with short, long or coarse-haired beards.
Modern men are at a loss with their new hair growth given the lack of styling tools specifically intended to tame bushy beards.


Today, drying your beard hinges on acrobatic bravery, wielding a burning hot blow dryer in one hand and a brush or comb in the other.


We are pleased to introduce our fashion-inspired Xculpters, which combine the efficiency of a comb, a brush and hair dryer.

Fitted with a double comb and a clip brush attachment, Xculpter Wild dries, brushes, combs and “Xculpts” hair and beards.




The beard version comes with two clip brushes and a cool shot button that has fine temperature control.  One brush is asymmetrical for working close to the skin and the other comes with firm angled bristles for precision « Xculpting"".


Xculpter for short hair : New tool for new styles
Fashion has left men body-built, shaved and well-dressed…. but until now they had no tools to dry and sculpt their hair.





Specially designed for men's styling, the xculpters dry, comb, brush and ""Xculpt"" in a single step.
Available in 2 models:
XCULPTER XITY : Professional, Ionic, Compact, 2000 W 

XCULPTER WILD : Mini, light, On-the-go, 1050 W 





Xculpter for long hair :  Specially designed to make styling easy

Ionic and boosted air flow function ensuring flawless results on all types of hair.
Fitted with a double comb and clip brush attachments, Xculpter Xity dries, brushes, combs and “Xculpts” demanding hair.


It doesn't just make life easier for professionals;it's a game changer for men and women who don't know the first thing about styling.





The Xculpter design was specially engineered to channel the blow dryer's air flow towards the comb and the brush, preventing an unruly ""wild mane"" look.


The double row comb, which is longer than the brush, enables deep-down combing action.

The Xculpters are available in two models :

Also, the real peculiarity of the fair will be to give every visitor the possibility to personally try the devices exhibited at the fair, some of which will be among the most innovative ones. WTT will be attended by numerous companies, including large, medium and startup businesses. Conferences and workshops, in the same exposition area, will be the added values of the fair.



When?
20-21 November in Turin.

Where?
Around 10000 visitors are expected to attend the 2500 square meters of exhibition in Hall 5 of Lingotto Fiere. The public will be able to try and wear the devices being exhibited and to participate in conferences and debates held by leading figures in the industry.



  Let's make it together With your help, we will be able to decorate and fill the exhibition even more. Stands, interactive areas, the more the funding the more you will enjoy the experience! 
Our target is to provide a free event where the public is at the center of attention, being able to ""Touch the future"" and to be an active part of the fair.

That is why we believe that your donation is so important: together we will offer the possibility to companies, and start-ups, to be in the spotlight and to let people discover how useful wearable technology can be.

    Risks & Challenges
As any brand-new campaign there are risks to take into account; investing on the future has never certainties, even though the expectations are extremely high.
We like to work professionally, so the event will take place anyway: of course, being students, the exhibition planning has been demanding by itself, but we managed to overcome the challenges by working hard to make it happen.

<p>Since I studied at Cornell in 1990s, I enjoyed working in machine shops for optical and mechanical systems. Then I love to do hands-on works.

<p>However, drones are easily damaged when they hit something, forcing the fun of flight to be stopped because of the damage. Thus playing them could be very frustrating, regardless of the cost for repairs or complete destroy of the drones. <br/></p>

<h3><b>Our Idea </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>To avoid the frustration, I come up this idea to protect them from being damaged even if they hit the ceiling, walls, or other things on their ways. With this anti-collision frame, drones have more freedom to fly. Even indoors of limited space, one can play them freely, without much worry about damage. My flying skill is also greatly improved because the protection from the anti-collision frame allows me to practice many more times without damaging the drones.<br/></p>

<h3><b><b><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>My first set up for the drone protection is effective, but very preliminary. With your support, I plan to make further refined anti-collision frames. Also hope to make the frames have the following excellent characteristics:</p>
<p>1. Easily custom-design for various sizes of drones.</p>
<p>2. Could fit 4-, 6-, or 8-axis copters. </p>
<p>3. Light-weight, strong, and flexible for absorbing shocks under collision.</p>
<p>4. Small package for convenient shipping and easy to put on to your drones. </p>
<p>5. Give you the courage and freedom to fly drones everywhere, every site, or even indoors when the bad weather stops you flying outdoors or you want to shoot photos or videos of indoor activities from the air.</p>
<p>Your support will enable this technology to become a reality, so we can produce and deliver you the smart-protection device. In this way, we will certainly make drones very friendly to players, no more worry about collision, damage, or even destroy of the entire drones. People will enjoy a lot more in flying drones. <br/></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></b><p>For the small-fund raising to build creative things with hardwares, the most challenge is the production. The raised fund may not be enough for the mold to fabricate the quantity from the pledged amount. To avoid the possible difficulty to deliver the pledged number of items, we have invented two different ways for the production. If the quantity is less than 10K, we will hand-make them, so the cost for the mold is not necessary. We have already surveyed the materials and steps that allow us to hand-make quickly and positively. Thus we will deliver you the device even if the pledged number is less than 10K.<br/>If the pledged quantity is above 10K, the fund raised will be enough and allow us to mold-produce the large number. We have also designed the configuration and parts required to assemble the frame for the drones, which can be mold-produced. Then we will certainly be able to deliver you the device.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Hopefully the pledged number is large, so we can go ahead to mold-produce the frame, making it a real business to benefit many people that are attracted by the drones, but afraid of the collision damages due to the unskillful flying control. As the barrier to play drones is lowered, using drones in many aspects may become part of our daily life. </p>

 The Story.Fitness with Clinical Precision. Our combined 20+ years of clinical experience came together in 2016 when we opened our brick and mortar facility called Recharge. Our goal was to combine the medical knowledge of physical therapists, with coaching expertise, and community feel.  We were frustrated with constantly treating pain and seeing people return to baseline levels of normal.We wanted to be less reactive, and entirely proactive in helping people live active, sustainably healthy lives. In large part, we've succeeded. We have a tremendous local community and we are incredibly proud to be their health epicenter.Over the last couple years we began asking ourselves if we could take the critical pillars of Recharge and build a platform that could benefit others beyond our 4 walls. The answer is yes we can. The result is Recharge Move. We've realized that for people to successfully begin and sustain a fitness routine they need: 1) structured, yet fun programming, 2) adjustability to unique needs or limitations, 3) ability to keep moving when aches/pain inevitability come up.  Recharge Move integrates all of these into a unique package that provides:Find Your Movement CustomizerDetermine your ideal hinge, push up, squat, and over head positions.

In order to have the quality guaranteed, we have established a moxa plantation farm in central China where produces the best moxa in China. We make sure that our moxa essence are all well selected, and no artificial oil added.  SHAREEveryone deserves the great benefit of moxibustion. However, due to the limited education and marketing, not too many people really knows about moxibustion,not to say understand the benefit for moxibustion. In order to generate more awareness,we want to start from innovation on moxibustion. BETTER USER EXPERIENCEGenerally the moxibustion is a quite easy medical practice which only requires some basic guidance. However, the traditional moxibustion needs to burn moxa, the burning will produce quite a lot smoke and might cause potential firing. Besides the smoke , you also have to set up the moxibustion box and fix it . So the whole process and experience is quite annoying. And we want to simplify the experience,and make it smokeless. TRADTION MEETS MODERNThe moxibustion has been practiced for more than 2000 years , which is proven to be quite effective by generations and generations. No major moxibustion innovation occurs, only until now the modern manufacturing and mobile Internet application. MAKE IT PORTABLEWith years in depth research, we have the full capability to make moxibustion from a medical service into a portable device.  With our device you can do moxibustion at home, in your office,even you are on a tour. MOXIBUSTION ON THE GO  NO MORE SMOKE ,NO MORE  WIREUnlike the traditional moxibustion, our product is 100% smokeless and dust free.SMART MOXIBUSTIONJiudaifu i9 comes up with smartphone APP which can be downloaded on both AppStore and GooglePlay. With the App, you would be able to control the moxibustion device via your smartphone.temperature and time can be setup via the APP at the same time.It will be super easy to control the temeperature and time range according to your personal perference and physical condition.It is safe and handy. For those who does not know how to find the acupuncture points,the APP also offers a feature to let you find the right point easily.
