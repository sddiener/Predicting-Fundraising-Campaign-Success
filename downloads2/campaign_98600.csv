<p>My name is Thomas Hauer Jr., and I am a recently discharged US Army veteran
living in North Carolina. Throughout my military career, my wife Sarah and I
have always dreamed of moving out of the country to Costa Rica and starting our own small business. Now, after 5
years on active duty and 2 combat deployments to Afghanistan, my service in the
US military has come to an end. My wife and I are finally able to leave the rat race and a restrictive military lifestyle so we can follow our wildest dreams. We have sold everything that we own, except for our clothes, laptop and our two dogs Nala and Buddy. With that money and all of our savings, we will be taking the biggest step of our lives when we move to Costa Rica on April 22nd, 2015. <br/></p>
<p>Since Sarah and I both love the outdoors and a laid back lifestyle, we not only want to live the Pura Vida (a Costa Rican expression, meaning Pure Life)
in Costa Rica, but also want to promote the country's incredible ecosystem and array of outdoor activities. To do this, we purchased the franchise rights to begin publishing the<i> </i>Costa Rican edition of<i> Coastal Angler Magazine</i>. This magazine is a free bimonthly publication,
dedicated to the fishing, boating and outdoor enthusiasts of Costa Rica. In addition, we will be starting <i>Adventure Costa Rica</i>, which will be a reputable source to book fishing trips and favorite outdoor activities. So not only will we be informing readers of all the amazing things Costa Rica has to offer, we will also be assisting them in experiencing the best outdoor adventures of their lives. <br/></p>
<h3>The Impacts</h3>
<p>While Costa Rica is gaining popularity for its’ unbeatable fishing opportunities
and pure natural beauty, there is no magazine dedicated to the fishing, boating
and outdoor enthusiasts of this flourishing country. By publishing our magazine in
Costa Rica, we will be giving this wonderful community the<b> </b>recognition and
support it deserves. <i>Coastal Angler Magazine </i>will also allow
businesses and organizations throughout Costa Rica to continue growing by offering a reliable platform to spread information and
advertise. Lastly, the magazine will act as an advocate for the continued
protection and preservation of the marine resources of Costa Rica. <br/></p><p>Through <i>Adventure Costa Rica </i>, we will take part in the ever-growing tourism industry in a country that is quickly becoming a world famous destination. <br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To help us pursue our dream, we have set a goal to raise $8,000 to help us purchase a vehicle. In order for us to really grow our businesses and be successful a vehicle is a necessity.  <br/></p>
<p>We have many great perks for those who want to help us out in our great adventure!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As we start our businesses, we believe our most immediate risk and challenge
is obtaining reliable transportation. Until we can purchase a vehicle we are going to have to rely on a long term rental car, which will get expensive quickly. Once we have our own vehicle, we will be able to network more effectively and gather magazine content throughout Costa Rica. <br/></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to donate, there are still ways to help!
Please share our story and campaign via social media, email, and word of mouth with your
friends and family. Thank you for your support and PURA VIDA!!!!!!<br/></p>

<p>Sea Scouts from Ship 564 operate the
vessel <i>Conquest</i> from their base in
Long Beach, CA. They are one of the most active Sea Scout Ships in the Long Beach
Area Council. Sea Scouts is a B.S.A. program for young men and women ages 14-21.<br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the economy and
other factors, our fundraising this year has been below the normal levels. We
had raised some money for haul-out but the yard that usually
gives us a large discount is unable to do so. This has meant a
dramatic increase in costs at a time when significant repairs are necessary.
Over the past few months, we have spent much of the money doing the work that
can be done in the water. Now, we need to haul out and finish the work under
the boat. </p>
<p>Our funds are low and will not cover
the cost of these repairs and maintenance projects.</p>
<p>This campaign is being run by The Pacific
Youth Boating Association, a 501c3 non-profit organization dedicated to
supporting Sea Scout Ship 564 and the <i>M/V</i>

<i>Conquest</i><br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p><i>Conquest</i> is a former U.S. Navy
Utility Boat. Built by the Harbor Boatbuilding Company in Long Beach, CA in
1965, she served aboard the USS Samuel Gompers (AD-37) from 1967 until 1989.
Transferred to the Sea Scouts in Stockton, CA later, she was acquired by the
Pacific Youth Boating Association in 1995 and transferred to Long Beach. Since
then, the Sea Scouts, with help from industry professionals, have transformed
the empty hull into a cruising boat that is one of the most active boats in the
Long Beach Sea Scout Squadron. Since her launch in 2003, she has made many
cruises to points like Catalina Island, San Diego and other Southern California
ports. She has also carried her crew on annual summer long cruises to the
Channel Islands and other, farther points. In July our summer cruise visited
San Francisco and Sacramento, a cruise of 12 days and 957 miles.</p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The Pacific Youth Boating Association
supports Sea Scouting in Long Beach through its support of the <i>Conquest</i> and Sea Scout Ship 564.
 The mission of Sea Scout Ship 564 is to provide a unique opportunity to
local young men and women to teach good seamanship practices while preparing
them to make good ethical and moral choices over their lifetime as they learn
the values of the Sea Promise, Scout Oath and Scout Law.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>

<h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/> My father died when I was very little so from early age I had to become head of the house, taking care of  my mother and grandmother. I am coming from a working class family and since I know for myself I was working all day almost everyday as a pizza delivery boy. At one point in life I got married and started my own business (you guessed it - pizza delivery store!), but after few years all fell apart: I got divorced, economic downturn in my country helped my business to collapse and now I am working again for the man as a pizza delivery boy to help support my mother and grandmother. Besides regular work I love making music and with help of my friends I started to publish some songs (I published 2 albums!!)..but that's another story because in my country you cannot live of making hip-hop music.</span>

</div></div>","Hello everyone!My name is Steve Mešić. I'm 32 years old and I come from Zagreb, Croatia. Croatia is a small and beautiful country - you just have to come and see it for yourself! 

 My father died when I was very little so from early age I had to become head of the house, taking care of  my mother and grandmother. I am coming from a working class family and since I know for myself I was working all day almost everyday as a pizza delivery boy. At one point in life I got married and started my own business (you guessed it - pizza delivery store!), but after few years all fell apart: I got divorced, economic downturn in my country helped my business to collapse and now I am working again for the man as a pizza delivery boy to help support my mother and grandmother. Besides regular work I love making music and with help of my friends I started to publish some songs (I published 2 albums!!)..but that's another story because in my country you cannot live of making hip-hop music.


Boys and girls, as said in a song: ""I think there's something more, life's worth living for"". In that sense I decided: I will fulfill my life long dream of being free, doing what I love (biking) and traveling the world in pursuit of happiness. I will pedal the globe, with stops in different countries where I will look for a job so I can fund my quest and hopefully sent some money back home.


I will  cycle 24,000 kilometers, sleep on the streets for all I care, but I want to work and make my mother proud and make something of myself  now, while I'm still young,  because if I don't I will regret it  in old age. 


Sky is the limit if you believe in yourself.

It would be great if I could get some funds to get me off on this trip, but no matter what happens - I am going!

I have put 5000.00 $ as my flexible budget. That funds should be enough to cover all the expenses - new bike, bike equipment, visa costs (US please abolish visa requirements for Croatian citizens!!! :)), plane tickets (when I will travel across the ocean),  accommodations, phone bills, food, drinks.

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The coffee is a 100% pure and has no chemicals nor additives, it is baked and roasted directly, without extra steps, plus is planted at 1200 meters above sea level; all this gives the coffee an unique and pleasant taste and smell, this coffee is so good that can compete (with a little bit of help) with the top coffee brands in the world. This coffee is planted, baked,toasted and distributed here in Costa Rica, but i want to distribute it to the rest of the world, you just need to taste it and you will realize how good it is and when you realize how good it is you will be drinking it 24/7.</span><br/>
</div>
<div>I have clients in the hotel sector and in gourmet coffee shops that normally buy big amounts, also a few bags are for friends and family and I´m also starting to get in the global market. The thing is that for me to get to the next level I need the equipment to do it, right now the company that toast and grind my coffee charge me $2 per 2 pounds (mistake in the video), this reduces my winnings, they also don´t toast me coffee for urgent orders and when they do it takes a while because the place is 2 hours away. With the equipment I´m asking for I would be able to be more efficient and to deliver the service and price the clients deserve. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">This coffee is already generating profit, but it need an impulse to get where it should be in the market, so you can taste an amazing coffee from Costa Rica in your own living room. </span>

<div>For this project I need $25 000, with that I can buy the machines I need (listed in ""what we need"") and give the impulse it needs. I would be really glad and it would be a great motivation for me to get that money and I guarantee you that I will work hard and be responsible with the money you donate. I would literally cry for something like this because it would be a reward and gift for all my effort and work that I make  every day, it would be a blessing!

</div> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I would use the money to buy a coffee toaster, specifically a bendig TD-10, a versatile machine that can toast 8kg (17.6 lbs) to 20kg (44 lbs) of coffee per batch; then I would buy a coffee grinder model M-10 with motor 10HP that can grind 600 kg/hr (1322.7 lbs/hr); also an industrial machine for sealing bags, because the one i have is too simple and finally a mini double toaster to toast small quantities to taste samples.</p>

<p>But lets think more worldwide, Hippocrates said, ""let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food"" coffee is a great example of the antioxidants and beneficial nutrients that can improve your health. Some evidence-based health benefits of coffee are: it can improve energy levels, burn fat, improve physical performance, it may lower your risk of type ll diabetes and my personal favorite, it can make you happier; you can google it if you want.</p>
<p><a href=""http://authoritynutrition.com/top-13-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-coffee/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://authoritynutrition.com/top-13-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-coffee/</a><br/></p>
<p>And what better way to get all this by drinking an amazing coffee, so help me give all this benefits to the world at an affordable price and with astonishing taste.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The main risk on this is the wide market that coffee and drinks have, because competing against big name brands is not easy, but many of those brands don´t offer the quality of coffee I´m offering, with some marketing I can get to compete against this brands in no much time, because I´m sure my coffee is better than what they offer. This company is young, but in a few months I have done a lot, many people tell me how fast this has been, I did what many take a year or two to get in just a few months and way less money, imagine what I can do with having a good fund and a year, with just that I can do what it takes to get this coffee where it should be.</p>

</div></div>","Hello folks, Henry Olaverri, founder and CEO of Hacienda Olaverri, talking.

My name as I already told you is Henry Olaverri, I live in the beautiful city of San Jose, Costa Rica. I´m 40 years old, married and father of two amazing kids. I love coffee (who don´t) and be able to provide a high quality coffee to the world is great.






                   
The coffee is a 100% pure and has no chemicals nor additives, it is baked and roasted directly, without extra steps, plus is planted at 1200 meters above sea level; all this gives the coffee an unique and pleasant taste and smell, this coffee is so good that can compete (with a little bit of help) with the top coffee brands in the world. This coffee is planted, baked,toasted and distributed here in Costa Rica, but i want to distribute it to the rest of the world, you just need to taste it and you will realize how good it is and when you realize how good it is you will be drinking it 24/7.

I have clients in the hotel sector and in gourmet coffee shops that normally buy big amounts, also a few bags are for friends and family and I´m also starting to get in the global market. The thing is that for me to get to the next level I need the equipment to do it, right now the company that toast and grind my coffee charge me $2 per 2 pounds (mistake in the video), this reduces my winnings, they also don´t toast me coffee for urgent orders and when they do it takes a while because the place is 2 hours away. With the equipment I´m asking for I would be able to be more efficient and to deliver the service and price the clients deserve. This coffee is already generating profit, but it need an impulse to get where it should be in the market, so you can taste an amazing coffee from Costa Rica in your own living room. 


                                                
For this project I need $25 000, with that I can buy the machines I need (listed in ""what we need"") and give the impulse it needs. I would be really glad and it would be a great motivation for me to get that money and I guarantee you that I will work hard and be responsible with the money you donate. I would literally cry for something like this because it would be a reward and gift for all my effort and work that I make  every day, it would be a blessing! So if you love coffee like me please donate, it would be really helpful.
   What I Need & What You Get I would use the money to buy a coffee toaster, specifically a bendig TD-10, a versatile machine that can toast 8kg (17.6 lbs) to 20kg (44 lbs) of coffee per batch; then I would buy a coffee grinder model M-10 with motor 10HP that can grind 600 kg/hr (1322.7 lbs/hr); also an industrial machine for sealing bags, because the one i have is too simple and finally a mini double toaster to toast small quantities to taste samples.

  

Of course I don´t forget about you, you can get mugs with different designs, french presses, coffee makers, paintings for coffee lovers, set of decorative barista stencils template strew pad duster spray tools and obviously one of the best coffees from Costa Rica (in different sizes).

    The Impact The impact  for you is as simple as this: I love coffee, if you´re still reading this you probably love it too, so let me give you the coffee you deserve, so you can have a happier day at great cost. 

                                       
But lets think more worldwide, Hippocrates said, ""let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food"" coffee is a great example of the antioxidants and beneficial nutrients that can improve your health. Some evidence-based health benefits of coffee are: it can improve energy levels, burn fat, improve physical performance, it may lower your risk of type ll diabetes and my personal favorite, it can make you happier; you can google it if you want.
http://authoritynutrition.com/top-13-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-coffee/
And what better way to get all this by drinking an amazing coffee, so help me give all this benefits to the world at an affordable price and with astonishing taste.
    Risks & Challenges The main risk on this is the wide market that coffee and drinks have, because competing against big name brands is not easy, but many of those brands don´t offer the quality of coffee I´m offering, with some marketing I can get to compete against this brands in no much time, because I´m sure my coffee is better than what they offer. This company is young, but in a few months I have done a lot, many people tell me how fast this has been, I did what many take a year or two to get in just a few months and way less money, imagine what I can do with having a good fund and a year, with just that I can do what it takes to get this coffee where it should be.
    Other Ways You Can Help and Contact Info. If you can´t help at the moment it would be great that you could spread the world with your friends and family, share it in social media, you can like the Facebook page: Cafe Hacienda Olaverri or when it grows buy some coffee.

<p><b>The What</b></p>
<p><a href=""https://advntur.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Advntur </a>is the
travel platform athletes and adventurers have been waiting for. We connect
athletes away from home with locals to share the sport they love. Host athletes
earn money sharing any combo of gear, their local knowledge and time and even their
home, earn money playing their sport. Visiting athletes play their sport easily
anywhere they go and share a unique experience with a fellow athlete.</p>
<p><b>The Dream</b></p>
<p>Imagine surfing in
South Africa, snowboarding in Norway, hiking in Hokkaido and mountain biking in
Whistler, all without ever packing anything but your sense of adventure. Now
imagine playing the sport you love where you live and getting paid to do it.</p>
<p><b>The Why</b></p>
<p>We founded Advntur because
we believe people should be able to do what they love wherever they go and our
belief that the best experiences in life are shared. We've traveled far and
wide and seen some amazing things, and the best experiences have been the ones
when we had someone to share in the moment. </p>
<p>Our founder, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/matt.doran.50"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/matt.doran.50"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matt Doran</a>, is a rower - been
doing it for 17 years. He wanted to be able to row wherever he went, and that's
not always easy. He can't fit his boat on a plane; there isn't much of a rental
market or it's crappy gear or way overpriced; he has no idea where to go, and
even if he does the research, there's no guarantees it'll work out; and he'd be
going it alone. He loves rowing. It's his passion. He wants to do it wherever
he goes, and you should be able to enjoy your sport when you travel, too. What
better way than to connect with a local?</p>
<p><b>The Origin</b></p>
<p>Matt was on his
honeymoon in Japan this past November, and he got to row in their biggest Fall race outside Kyoto. He raced with the Yokohama
Rowing Club, and it was incredible. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472787351/12339623_10100591507870462_1431505324525672956_o_tbin1y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>It made his honeymoon that much more
special and rich, and it was all thanks to a local whom Matt happened to know
who hooked it up. We want to offer that immersive, connected experience to all
athletes. </p>
<p><b>The How</b></p>
<p>Only locals will have
the gear you need and the inside info the play your sport on your terms. They
know all the best spots to play and the best spots to relax. From the trail to
the pub, they can help you live like a local and show you your new city on your
terms.You live your day-to-day life as a surfer/cyclist/hiker/triathlete/etc.
Don’t leave your passion behind when you travel. Connect with a local and share
an adventure.</p>
<p><b>The Opportunity</b></p>
<p>We need your help
reaching out to the athletic community. We need to spread the word and show
athletes there’s a better way to travel. By supporting Advntur now, you’ll help
us build our community from the ground up and change the way athletes travel. </p>
<p><b>The Ask</b></p>
<p>We’re raising $30,000
to prove Advntur is the platform athletes need and are excited about. We’re
based in San Diego, so we’re starting by proving the model here with the ultimate
goal of creating a global network to connect athletes everywhere. We will use
these funds to recruit local highly qualified host athletes to lead visitors on
the most incredible, thrilling sports adventures San Diego has to offer. Our
intial target sports are Surfing, Cycling, Triathlon, Fitness, Running and
Rowing. We’ll recruit athletes and adventurers who love what they do and love
sharing it with others. Once they’re on the platform and anxious to lead
adventures, we’ll start advertising to all the athletes coming to San Diego.
Whether they’re coming for the Rock ‘n’ Roll marathon or a business trip or a
family vacation or just want some time at the beach in America’s Finest City, we
want to help them enjoy their sport and show them there’s a better way to
travel: the Advntur way. Our robust platform is ready to help athletes enjoy
their sport on their terms, sharing adventures that create indelible memories.
Now we need your help recruiting them!</p>
<p><b>The Perks</b></p>
<p>Supporters of all contribution
levels will be thanked with gifts ranging from swag to gift cards at the sport
outlet of your choice to free adventures to a free weekend stay in founder Matt

<p><b>The Shortfall</b></p>
<p>If we don’t reach our
goal, we will honor all perks and still use every last red cent to grow our
community. Advntur’s lifeblood is the passion of our founders and our
community, and that’ll never run out!</p>
<p><b>The History</b></p>
<p>Money we’ve previously
raised has been from people the founders knew from their athletic experiences.
We’ve used it to build our powerful platform. Now it’s time to swing the
pendulum away from technical development and toward growin’ this damn thang! </p>
<p><b>The Risk</b></p>
<p>Advntur is a startup, and like any other entrepreneurial endeavor
traffics in risk as much as it does noble pursuits. If we don’t raise
sufficient capital, our chances for success decrease. Growing the local host
athletes, the Supply side of our marketplace, costs time and human capital. We
need to have the right people on our team to conduct our outreach and connect
with the best athletes in San Diego to start and then branching out. Growing
the visting athletes, the Demand side of our marketplace, costs advertising
dollars. We’ll be utilizing Facebook ads, Instagram ads, display advertising on
sport-specific sites, advertising at events, retargeting advertisements – a
battery of digitial and grassroots efforts to connect with the athletes coming
to San Diego who don’t yet know they need Advntur. We need to learn as quickly
as possible what initiaves work and what don’t so we can scrap the ones that
aren’t and pour gas on the ones catching fire. We need to grow as fast but as
smart as possible. We have been very careful with our funding to date, and we
will be with the support you show us. </p>
<p><b>The Solution</b></p>
<p>How do we overcome the risks? Simple: You. We have the tools. We have the
passion. We just need the people who believe in us to help us spread the word.
Even if you don’t have the means to make a financial contribution, you can help
Advntur succeed just by joining our community and telling your athletic and
adventurous friends to do the same. Advntur is as strong as its members. If you
join and recruit just two athletes who then do the same, we’ll be surfing in South Africa, snowboarding in
Norway, hiking in Hokkaido and mountain biking in Whistler in no time! Nothing
beats the recommendation of a friend. If you believe in Advntur, if you want to
see Advntur succeed so you can use it, recruit your friends. There’s even a way
to earn money doing it!</p>
<p>When you sign up for
Advntur, you get your own promo code. Share that promo code with your friends
on Facebook, and when they sign up with your promo code, they’ll get $25 toward
their first adventure. How generous of you, right?! Once they book their first
adventure as a guest, you get $25. Once they book their first adventure as a
host, you get $50. You can earn up to $75 per athlete you refer and give each
one a gift of a discount toward their first adventure. </p>
<p><b>The Baton</b></p>
<p>If they’re athletic,
tell your friends, tell your grandmother, tell your bus driver. Spread the
word. Pass the baton. Help us grow Advntur so you can connect with people who
love your sport as much as you do!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">HOW DID VANTOLA START?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">VANTOLA is a cycling exploration brand started by Billy Homan. Aged 15, Billy embarked on his first long distance cycle ride to raise money for charity in memory of the death of his mother. This is now an annual event, to raise more money for charities through his adventurous bike tours. In 2016 he completed the ride from Vancouver to Los Angeles, some 2500km. Thus Vantola was formed. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">As a result of his travels, especially the wet and soggy moments, Billy spotted a gap in the market for a waterproof high quality rucksack specifically designed by an adventurer for adventurers. The rucksack combines modern aesthetics with hardwearing waterproof nylon fabric to create the ultimate companion.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">VANTOLA have created and extensively tested numerous prototypes over the last year. The rucksack has been put to the test in various situations and environments. From Vancouver to Los Angeles, a circumnavigation of Sardinia and a week trip to Milan, the bag has been thoroughly tested. Details such as the contrast orange webbing, grab handle and reflective strips make the VANTOLA rucksack stand out from the crowd.</p>

HOW DID VANTOLA START?
VANTOLA is a cycling exploration brand started by Billy Homan. Aged 15, Billy embarked on his first long distance cycle ride to raise money for charity in memory of the death of his mother. This is now an annual event, to raise more money for charities through his adventurous bike tours. In 2016 he completed the ride from Vancouver to Los Angeles, some 2500km. Thus Vantola was formed. 
 

As a result of his travels, especially the wet and soggy moments, Billy spotted a gap in the market for a waterproof high quality rucksack specifically designed by an adventurer for adventurers. The rucksack combines modern aesthetics with hardwearing waterproof nylon fabric to create the ultimate companion.
 

 
THE RUCKSACK

Vantola have created a customisable rucksack that is designed for both use in urban and natural environments. The Vantola rucksack has a generous capacity of 25 litres, divided into 3 separate compartments each of which are accessed through a heavy-duty waterproof zip.
 

 
VANTOLA have created and extensively tested numerous prototypes over the last year. The rucksack has been put to the test in various situations and environments. From Vancouver to Los Angeles, a circumnavigation of Sardinia and a week trip to Milan, the bag has been thoroughly tested. Details such as the contrast orange webbing, grab handle and reflective strips make the VANTOLA rucksack stand out from the crowd.
 

 
FEATURES
The bag straps can be removed to alter how you wear the bag to better suit the situation. This also allows you to customise the colour in order to suit your style.The straps will be available in your choice of orange, aqua or grey. Custom carabiners attach  the bag straps to the VANTOLA rucksack. Choose your colour.


 
The spacious main compartment is lined with bright nylon allowing you to easily find objects quickly. The main compartment also has a security pocket that has been designed to prevent the theft of important items such as phones, wallets and passports. 
 

 
The front pocket has been designed to fit to a large bike lock or a standard sized map inside. The zip is hidden when shut making this pocket very secure. 
 

 
The laptop compartment has been securely designed to provide you with a safe state of mind while cycling the busy commute or the challenging mountain climb.
 

 
A smelly compartment at the bottom of the bag is accessible from the back. This separates any smelly clothes from travelling, commuting or going to the gym, from your valuables in the main compartment.
 

 
The handy side pocket has been designed to accommodate items that need to be accessed quickly. Whether it is your phone, sunglasses, snacks or bike repair kit, all without taking the bag off your back.
 

 
A water bottle pocket is located on the side of the bag, with reflective detailing to help protect you when commuting.

The bike light is not bright enough on field roads or too dazzling on urban streets.
The visual angle is not wide enough when riding fast at night.
The temperature of the bike light becomes too hot after long time use. 
The bike light stops working in harsh environments.

   B3 is different.

 
Our main concern is to be safe on the road, be seen by other vehicles and be able to have a clear view no matter the time, the weather or the environment.B3 enables the cycling community to ride both in an urban and non-urban environment. Ensuring maximum safety and allows the user to be seen and see the roadway when riding in dark or poorly illuminated lanes. Mountain bikers can use B3 as a professional tool for night and off-trail riding that keeps them clear from obstacles along the way. The possibility to turn B3 into a bright headlamp make it an essential and practical companion of runners and adventurers.150˚ visibility and up to 2200 lumens, ensuring you’ll get noticed on the road, even in broad daylight and from different angles. To ride confidently even through the deepest darkness we not only have to consider how much brightness our bike light can deliver but even how the light is distributed.B3 triple LED structure solves both of the problems thanks to the adjustable brightness and the LED choice function. 1 Emitter: suitable for urban cycling and city environment. You can let other vehicles know that you also belong to the road, while not disturbing other drivers with a strong light.2 Emitters: increases visibility and safety, great for road biking and off-road riding, when the user needs a more powerful light to clearly see the obstacles (rocks, roots, etc) along the way.3 Emitters: perfect for mountain biking and extreme sports, creates a wide protective field of light, enhancing the rider’s safety and enlarging the field of view even in the deepest darkness.   We managed to combine functionality with appearance. The deep fins design on the case maximizes the surface area and increases the airflow for an outstanding cooling effect and thermal transfer performance.  Its effective thermal dissipation stands long time use and keeps the bike light cool and efficient, no matter the weather.  The user can easily choose which emitter to activate, use one, two or three at a time, and customize mode and brightness for each of the lights.You can set a normal brightness mode (low, medium, high) or a special mode (strobe, SOS, beacon) in case of an emergency. 


 

 
 

B3 bike light is equipped with 2 switches, the first one to turn it on / off and choose how many emitters to use (one, two or three); the second key is made to regulate your light.Furthermore, it is possible to personalize and adjust the brightness level, that increases by 10% - until reaching 100% - and save it through memory function.   The smart indicator blue light becomes a friend on the road, once B3 is turned on, the indicator it will warn the user about battery level and will allow the user to know in advance how much power is left.More than 50%, blue light on;10%-50%, red light on;Less than 10%, red flashing light, flashes once every second; Unmatched innovations, to ensure the maximum level of safety on the roadway. 1. 3 LED emitters that work independently, each of them is provided with mode setting (high, medium, low) and brightness adjustment function. Plus special modes: strobe, beacon, SOS:- the user has complete control over the bike light and can set brightness and mode according to the environment.- the three emitters work independently, if one emitter is out of order the others can still work properly. 2. The heat dissipation structure (external fins, internal copper plates, thermoelectric separation) :-guarantees longer lifespan: 30% higher than common bike lights.-lowers the heating level of the bikelight: 15°-20° C  less than common bike lights. Special features:- Extreme visibility and safety on the road, providing a full 150 degrees of powerful protective lighting, no matter where you are.-It is small, weighs only 135g and boasts from 50 lumens up to a maximum brightness of 2200 lumens.-It is suitable for road biking, mountain biking, and urban cycling. It becomes a sport and excursion accessory.-It suitable for any kind of bicycle and environment, stable on the bike thanks to the Go pro mount, and installation is quick and simple.-Memory function.-It is lightweight, compact and versatile. It is 2 in 1: bike light and headlamp.-It is waterproof IPX67, it can soak up to 1m underwater for 24h.-It is impact resistant - crafted with high-quality materials and the highest grade electronic components.-It is both safe and convenient. The battery indicator warns you in advance of how much power you have left and it doesn’t suddenly turn off when you on the road.-The two switches are easy and immediate to use, suitable both for professionals and amateurs.   We are a group of engineers, designers, and researchers but first of all cyclists. We share the same passion for cycling and want to promote bicycle lifestyle and alternative mobility while inspiring others to do the same. Our goal is to enhance safety and make sure we can see and be seen wherever we go.

<p>Have you ever been cycling? Hiking/Backpacking? Snowshoeing?  Let Adventure Xcursions guide you in a successful first time or even for those avid goers why not join a group of like-minded locals and explore together!</p>
<p>Adventure Xcursions was created to bring together all outdoor and adventure sports together in one central business catering to the Buffalo area. We wanted to create a business that geared to everyone and combined not only one activity, but multiple in order to fulfill everyone’s passions, hobbies, and “want to do’s”.</p>
<p>We ourselves have always had a love and passion for nature and outdoor activities and felt that there is so much to do in Buffalo that many don’t know about. Nature is an escape from the everyday grind and technological dependency. Our vision and our goal is to provide a service that is different and yet incorporates all that we love about our beautiful city by not only providing guiding services for all outdoor adventure sports, but also incorporating local businesses as well to create an out of the box, fun, healthy, daring, and exciting experience for all. We also hope to educate those in the importance of health, fitness, and our environment. ​</p>
<p>Your help in funding and donations will greatly benefit Adventure Xcursions in so many ways to help kick-start our business into a thriving and established business! ​</p>
<p><strong>Where is your funding going??</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment and gear will be our main focus in funding. Everything from bikes, helmets, water bottles, fitness and exercise equipment, compasses, etc are essential in a quality business and enjoyable time. </li>
<li>Funding will also go towards start up and overall business cost such as rental cost, insurances, storage cost,office supplies, and travel cost.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What's in it for you? </strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping fund Adventure Xcursions you are contributing in more ways then just finacially. It is no secret that obesity in America is at an astounding high. More and more children these days are overweight and getting diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other health scares at a surprisingly young age. It is not only children, but teenagers and adults as well. Why? Because we are becoming more inactive and caught up in our technology that we forget what it means to get outside and be active while engaging in activity with friends and socializing outside the screen. I want to create a business where friends and family members of all ages can gather and engage in physical activity together! Stewardship is also key, my goal is to teach all the importance of keeping our environment safe and clean! </p>
<p>So lets get up, get moving, ""Escape the Normal and Get Xploring"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>There will be many obstacles and bumps in the road like any other small start up business, but I plan to keep my overall goal of bringing fitness, fun, and the great outdoors to all and provide a service that is unique and different. Some tours may not go the way I envision , but that will only allow me to learn from my mistake and make something even better! </li>
<li>Customer service it going to be my biggest goal. I know from past experience and careers that you can have the best product or service in the world, but it's taking care of the customers and employees first that ultimately leads a company to success.</li>

During my childhood I had many road trips through southern Peru where I got to know my country and its culture.After college I studied business administration at Universidad del Pacífico with the aim of starting my own business one day. And once graduated, I worked at Pizzerias Presto, the company of my parents, where I learned almost everything you need to know to start a business and make it successful.Last year, it was when I decided to venture myself to travel the world for a period of 11 months that allowed me to know myself and to inspire myself to start Qhispikay.°Me encanta viajar e ir aprendiendo en el camino, la primera vez que conocí el Valle Sagrado fue cuando tenía 8 años y simplemente ¡me enamoré!. Durante mi infancia tuve muchos viajes por carretera por el sur del Perú en donde pude conocer mi país y su cultura.después del colegio estudié administración de empresas en la Universidad del Pacífico con el objetivo de emprender mi propio negocio. Y una vez graduada, trabajé en Pizzerias Presto, la empresa de mis papás, en donde aprendí casi todo lo que se necesita saber para poder emprender un negocio y hacer que sea exitoso.Finalmente, el año pasado, fue cuando decidí aventurarme a viajar por el mundo durante un periodo de 11 meses que me permitió conocerme a mi misma e inspirarme para iniciar Qhispikay. Isaias Mendoza del SolarIn 2012 I made the decision to leave my office work in Lima and go out to travel the world investing my savings and time in gaining traveling experiences. Without a doubt the best decision I could have made so far, for the first time I felt really free and I feel that it is in this state that a person can discover and internalize their fears and passions.For me the fear is to let life pass and not try to live dreams and my passion is to work in a sustainable and regenerative development in tourism.The school I studied in Arequipa, I am a professional in business administration from the University of Lima and the last 4 years I work in the tourism sector.°En el 2012 tome la decisión de dejar mi trabajo de oficina en Lima y salir a recorrer el mundo invirtiendo mis ahorros y tiempo en ganar experiencias viajando. Sin duda la mejor decisión que pude haber tomado hasta ahora, por primera ves me sentí realmente libre y siento que es en este estado que una persona puede descubrir e interiorizar sus miedos y pasiones.Para mi el miedo es dejar pasar la vida y no intentar vivir los sueños y mi pasión es trabajar en un desarrollo sostenible y regenerativo en turismo.El colegio lo estudie en Arequipa, soy profesional en administración de empresas por la Universidad de lima y los 4 años trabajo en el sector de turismo.  ​",59.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Jamaica is a beautiful island, but sometimes it takes forever to experience its widely-spaced attractions by driving for hours each way in a tour bus or taxi! The fastest, safest, and most fun way to truly explore any island is by boat. At Paradise Express Ferry, we like to say:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE BEST WAY TO GET AROUND IS TO GO AROUND!</strong></p>
<p>We’re committed to crafting an unparalleled experience. <strong>Feel the sun on your face and the wind in your hair, or sit inside on airline-style reclining seats, and see more of the island in air conditioned comfort, safety and luxury! </strong>We’ve introduced exciting new technologies such as drones for live videos and pictures, and will provide you with FREE broadband Wi-Fi so that you can share your images and experiences in real time via social media! You can't do that while on the road.</p>
<p>This Fast Ferry Excursion service will also be transformational to Jamaica and will start a new industry that will create new employment opportunities and positively impact the lives of more than 150 people we will directly hire and train to world-class standards. After Jamaica, we expect to expand to Cuba, The Caymans, Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, and US/British Virgin Islands.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WE'RE HALF-WAY THERE! WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN PHASE I:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have previously raised and committed half of the $3M million required to launch, and have successfully leased prominent waterfront properties in beautiful Montego Bay and Negril.</li>
<li>We have pioneered the concept of integrated drone and Wi-Fi technologies on fast catamaran vessels and are working on a beta-version of our FREE travel App for tourists, which will give you unprecedented information on what to do and where to go while you're on vacation!</li>
<li>We have established key relationships with the Caribbean Maritime University and other local partners, and have obtained key approvals and/or licenses from Jamaican regulatory bodies for operating a fast ferry excursion attraction.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","INTRODUCING THE FIRST FERRY EXCURSION ATTRACTION IN JAMAICA!


Jamaica is a beautiful island, but sometimes it takes forever to experience its widely-spaced attractions by driving for hours each way in a tour bus or taxi! The fastest, safest, and most fun way to truly explore any island is by boat. At Paradise Express Ferry, we like to say:
THE BEST WAY TO GET AROUND IS TO GO AROUND!
We’re committed to crafting an unparalleled experience. Feel the sun on your face and the wind in your hair, or sit inside on airline-style reclining seats, and see more of the island in air conditioned comfort, safety and luxury! We’ve introduced exciting new technologies such as drones for live videos and pictures, and will provide you with FREE broadband Wi-Fi so that you can share your images and experiences in real time via social media! You can't do that while on the road.
This Fast Ferry Excursion service will also be transformational to Jamaica and will start a new industry that will create new employment opportunities and positively impact the lives of more than 150 people we will directly hire and train to world-class standards. After Jamaica, we expect to expand to Cuba, The Caymans, Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, and US/British Virgin Islands.


WE'RE HALF-WAY THERE! WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN PHASE I:

We have previously raised and committed half of the $3M million required to launch, and have successfully leased prominent waterfront properties in beautiful Montego Bay and Negril.
We have pioneered the concept of integrated drone and Wi-Fi technologies on fast catamaran vessels and are working on a beta-version of our FREE travel App for tourists, which will give you unprecedented information on what to do and where to go while you're on vacation!
We have established key relationships with the Caribbean Maritime University and other local partners, and have obtained key approvals and/or licenses from Jamaican regulatory bodies for operating a fast ferry excursion attraction.


PHASE II – RAISING THE REMAINING $1,500,000
Join this grass-roots effort! With a ONE-TIME CONTRIBUTION, you can select an option that gives you UNLIMITED FREE access to our excursions FOR LIFE in some cases! With your participation, we will launch this exciting venture in time for the next Winter's tourism season which starts December 2019! These funds will used to:

Work with the Caribbean Maritime University (CMU), to hire and train the initial class of approx. 40 men and women for vessel and shore-side operations. Depending on the Perk selected, your contribution may offset the tuition of a cadet at the CMU, which is approximately $6,500 per year.
Obtain a high-speed passenger catamaran ferry capable of accommodating up to 300 passengers.
Construct a Floating Dock & Temporary Terminal for our Montego Bay hub of operations.






THE TEAM BEHIND PARADISE EXPRESS
Paradise Express Ferry is pioneering, NY-based company founded in 2012. We are the first MBE-Certified Ferry Operations business in the New York/New Jersey region. That means we may someday operate in NY also! We scored another first by winning an international RFP from Jamaica to develop a novel waterfront tourism project in Montego Bay. In 2017 we became one of only 5 ferry-operations companies that has obtained a license from the US Government to operate to Cuba! Yes, we intend to provide a full-day or overnight excursion from Montego Bay to Santiago, Cuba as one of our earliest expansion plans! Future plans include setting up similar operations in other key Caribbean islands. Find out more on our website!
Paradise Express Ferry was founded by Garry Anthony Johnson, trained as an Architect, and a leading NY Real Estate & Economic Development expert, who has worked on hundreds of complex mixed-use development projects over his 30 year career. He was born in the United Kingdom and lived his early years in Kingston, Jamaica.
Luxury Marketing is being led by Sheri Wilson-Gray, a former Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer for the world-renowned Saks Fifth Avenue luxury retail brand and later, Island Global Yachting.
The Paradise Express team has over 150 years combined experience in Maritime Operations, Marketing, Real Estate & Economic Development, Security, and most of all exemplary Customer Service. We have the knowledge, skills and motivation to be successful while positively impacting lives.
 
EXECUTIVE TEAM

BOARD ADVISORS

Support this campaign by making a one-time contribution or selecting one of the Perks, some of which allow UNLIMITED use of our excursions for LIFE! Never pay again! In supporting this campaign, YOU will be an invaluable part in building Paradise Express Ferry, and support the local team members we will hire to provide you with this experience. Wouldn’t it have been great to have been invited to participate when JetBlue or Carnival launched? It’s not often that people are asked to take part in a company's development, and we’re excited to share the planning for our first launch with YOU!
PROJECT JOURNEY

We have successfully negotiated, leased, and built significant barriers to entry for a transformative and game-changing venture that we feel will be highly successful. Over the next several months our team will resume planning for the infrastructure and operations. We’re so excited and look forward to you being present at the launch in Montego Bay, Jamaica and our operations from December 2019 onwards!

<p>Hi! My name is Maya and I am fundraising to go on an awesome camp adventure in Vermont!  Since I am homeschooling I thought it would be a great experience to fundraise for my trip and use my entrepreneurial skills and artistic talents! The camp takes place for one week at the end of September in Vermont. I am fundraising for the cost of the camp, various items I need to participate (sleeping bags, backpack, warm clothes for Vermont fall) in addition to the plane ticket and transportation costs.</p>
<p>Your donations go directly to these costs.I decided to use IndieGoGo to fundraise because it offers a unique perks system, that lets you receive custom “perks” when you donate.  Since I am an artist and cupcake maker, I decided to offer my unique creations as “perks” when you donate. I have put together some amazing artistic perk choices for you to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Your donations will have a huge impact on my homeschool journey. This year I made the decision to homeschool. It has been an incredible experience. I really wanted to participate in something this fall that would allow me be with other homeschooling teens, and also attend a program that would give me a chance to participate in artistic and creative activities. I was so excited when I found Not Back to School Camp! It offers me a chance to make connections with other homeschooling teens and be a part of an amazing community.</p>
<p>The Perks that I am offering are:</p>
<p>$10 $25 $50 $75 $150 $300 or More</p>
<p><strong>Goals and Creative Perks</strong>  </p>
<p>My fundraising goal is $1,980. All of your donations go straight to my Vermont Adventure, where I will attend Not Back to School Camp . The funds will  go to tuition costs, equipment, and transportation costs.</p>
<p>When you donate you have a chance to receive my original perks like paintings, pictures I will be taking while at camp in Vermont, and cupcakes (local donations only).</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will go towards my Vermont Adventure where I will attend Not Back to School Camp. It will allow me to connect with other homeschooling teens and build a community that I  can stay connected to forever!</p>

<p>WanderSafe is the world's holistic <strong>first solo explorer's safety solution</strong>. It was developed by a female global nomad. She met thousands of women and vulnerable people who experienced various forms of violence and assault when traveling and commuting. In uncertain times, where there are situations and information could save your life, we've combined a smart personal safety device an intelligent smartphone app where <strong>JENI</strong>, your virtual safety concierge, provides you with location-centric travel tips personalized to your travel habits.</p>
<p>The WanderSafe device is discreet -- it can be held in your had and unseen by a potential attacker. Unlike your slick smartphone, it won't attract unwanted attention unless you activate it and you don't have to pray SIRI is able to respond fast enough. The WanderSafe is very simple to operate and is designed to de-escalate a potential unsafety situation as we believe the best confrontation you can have is one you can <strong>avoid</strong>. Out of the box, you can now walk, run and explore and feel more empowered. </p>

<h2>ALONIWERK - The Home Away From Home</h2>
<p>WELCOME to the first glamping resort in Kefalonia; a lavish place of rest, focussed on sustainable tourism. We invite you to stay on one of our flourishing camping pitches, in our luxury canvas tents, our glamping pods or tent cabins. All of these will be fully equipped and furnished.</p>
<p>ALONIWERK features a quiet, cozy retreat, located on 10.000 square meter green terraces, overlooking the gentle wooded hillside of the Paliki peninsula, on the west coast of Kefalonia.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ALONIWERK Campsite - the new glamping experience</h3>
<p>Crawling over the hills near the capital of the island, Argostoli, you will find millennia old cyclopean walls, built out of huge carved blocks of stone - a tribute to the enormous effort of the ancient inhabitants of the island.</p>
<p>We have decided to take on a cyclopean sized task of our own.</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559728952/twvgyhbjm0kb5brq0i5d.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Aloniwerk campsite will be built just outside a small village called Rifi.</p>
<p>Sitting on the very top of the Paliki peninsula, our land offers a setting like no other. Narrow winding roads, rocky terrain with thick bush overgrowth present numerous challenges, which would normally put most big developers off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558193233/nidlvzx0bywgnzjgtxkc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fortunately this leaves room for us - a family with a clear vision to build a place for you! This space is perfect for anyone who wishes to wake up to the sounds of goat herds grazing the rocky hills or avid bird watchers waiting for the powerful cries of nesting eagles.</p>
<p>If you are trying to avoid the busy all-inclusive hotel bars, but instead have a vision of sharing an evening with likeminded fellow travellers from all over the world, then look no further! We will host a range of local fresh products, from home-grown tomatoes to pitted olives and milk from the local shepherds.</p>
<p><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559643227/dblwyq6jfscs2uvjka8t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Vision Is Unconventional</h3>
<p>We aim to preserve the natural balances in our environment as much as possible, but we also have to meet all the legal requirements. This greatly increases our costs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559728992/rtdftuphoy4crxuc3q4c.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p>With that in mind we will get straight to the point; we want to open our doors to you in the spring 2020.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>What We Are Looking For</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking funding from people interested in sustainability and ecological tourism. 190.000,- € of funding is needed to complete the whole campsite project.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The Aloniwerk entire investment totals more than 500.000,- €</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Amount of self investment already carried out: 225.000,- €</p>
<p>These funds will be used to:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>pitch</strong> luxury accommodation pods, i.e. 4 geodesic domes* 40-50 m², 1 yurt* 40 m², 3 tent-cabins 16 - 20 m², (* all insulated, including heating-system, furnishing &amp; bathroom)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>further</strong> co-finance reforestation and greening of the campsite with endemic plants</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>kickstart</strong> the construction, regardless of whether this campaign reaches its full target</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>improve </strong>all parts of the accommodation and invest in future alternative energy (small wind turbines), should the campaign exceed its goal</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Become An ALONIWERK Supporter - the idea</h3>
<p>With a holiday at ALONIWERK you support the development of soft tourism on the island. Furthermore, you are also helping to promote our idea of quality stays which in turn sends a strong message against the negative impact of mass tourism. A number of holiday destinations are now showing more awareness of this positive change. This is a critical moment of self-awareness for countries economically dependent on travellers. With your decision to enjoy your holiday with us, you become part of this change.</p>
<p>We have managed to win over the local community and we have convinced the building authorities with the ""green"" design of our campsite: <strong>Now it’s your turn!</strong></p>
<p><strong> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560074063/xbtdnd5qdr62bih7ooem.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Join Us</strong> and become part of our vision of a distinctive campsite on an unspoiled green island in the heart of Europe. In return for your generous investment, we will be pleased to offer you the opportunity to be the first guests to visit ALONIWERK - your home away from home.</p>

<p><strong>More Than Just Rewards - a glimpse into our lives</strong></p>
<p>Each one of us plays a vital role in creating ALONIWERK.</p>
<p>Tim has specialised in nature and landscape photography, and has an eye for breathtaking scenery. He has great passion for history and an uncanny sense for finding signs of bygone times, the common traveler is less likely to notice, such as ancient paths, traces of the mycenaean period, small Byzantine churches, hidden wells and caverns and ruins of former settlements.</p>
<p>Melina is the driving force in the background. With her friendly, calm and thoughtful nature, she ensures that nothing gets out of hand and that joy and creativity come first. Her skillset will ensure the smooth running of not only the project, but your experiences on your holiday.</p>
<p>Nils is gifted with enthusiasm, cheerfullness and immense creativity. Whether he is working as a drone operator, graphic designer or offering unique media workshops, he will guarantee fun and development.</p>
<p>Alexandra - that's me; I have experience in developing concept design in the media and tourism sectors which I have gained during the nearly 30 years of holidaying, working and living on the island. I am passionate about local history, culture, nature and food.</p>
<p>We all live and breathe the activities and services we offer.</p>

<h3>Accommodation - The Local Inspiration</h3>
<p>You can find traditional shepherd stone shelters scattered all across the island. Blending in with the surrounding nature they are subtle and gentle on the eye.</p>

<p>We have been intrigued by these since the first time we came to the island. That’s why we came up with the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A Luxury Glamping Yurt</strong><br/>Surrounded by a protective stone wind breaker greened with various Mediterranean plants our already existing yurt made from natural materials offers good natural air flow and a glass roof ideal for star gazing.</p>

<p><strong>A Luxury Igloo-Inspired Glamping Dome</strong><br/>A more modern accommodation offering a wider viewing angle.

<p><br/><strong>Stone Cottages - designed for the future to connect past and present</strong><br/>Inspired by the traditional shepherd stone shelters we designed our own stone huts that mimic those in a modern way.</p>

<h3>Our Impact - soft tourism as a chance</h3>
<p>Sustainable tourism is a respectful way of travelling and exploring a destination. In 2019 many people travel, more now than ever before! The average traveller participates in mass tourism, which can be detrimental to the local culture and natural resources. This is why we have opted for buildings that are in keeping with the region, and have only 17 different options for accommodation. It is a known fact that most of the money generated from mass tourism goes to large companies instead of remaining in the country you visit.</p>
<p>Here at ALONIWERK we invite you to stay with us, and join us and invest in our family-run business.</p>
<p>Our mission is to offer a full spectrum experience, to which getting to know the island is an essential part of. The guided tours you will find among our services are specifically designed to encompass famous Greek hospitality with the island’s unique cuisine, to trace thousands of years of turbulent history, and to take you places where breath-taking views have not yet been seen by many.</p>

WELCOME to the first glamping resort in Kefalonia; a lavish place of rest, focussed on sustainable tourism. We invite you to stay on one of our flourishing camping pitches, in our luxury canvas tents, our glamping pods or tent cabins. All of these will be fully equipped and furnished.
ALONIWERK features a quiet, cozy retreat, located on 10.000 square meter green terraces, overlooking the gentle wooded hillside of the Paliki peninsula, on the west coast of Kefalonia.
 
ALONIWERK Campsite - the new glamping experience
Crawling over the hills near the capital of the island, Argostoli, you will find millennia old cyclopean walls, built out of huge carved blocks of stone - a tribute to the enormous effort of the ancient inhabitants of the island.
We have decided to take on a cyclopean sized task of our own.

 
The Aloniwerk campsite will be built just outside a small village called Rifi.
Sitting on the very top of the Paliki peninsula, our land offers a setting like no other. Narrow winding roads, rocky terrain with thick bush overgrowth present numerous challenges, which would normally put most big developers off.
 

 
Fortunately this leaves room for us - a family with a clear vision to build a place for you! This space is perfect for anyone who wishes to wake up to the sounds of goat herds grazing the rocky hills or avid bird watchers waiting for the powerful cries of nesting eagles.
If you are trying to avoid the busy all-inclusive hotel bars, but instead have a vision of sharing an evening with likeminded fellow travellers from all over the world, then look no further! We will host a range of local fresh products, from home-grown tomatoes to pitted olives and milk from the local shepherds.


 
Our Vision Is Unconventional
We aim to preserve the natural balances in our environment as much as possible, but we also have to meet all the legal requirements. This greatly increases our costs.
 
With that in mind we will get straight to the point; we want to open our doors to you in the spring 2020. 
What We Are Looking For
We are seeking funding from people interested in sustainability and ecological tourism. 190.000,- € of funding is needed to complete the whole campsite project.
The Aloniwerk entire investment totals more than 500.000,- €
Amount of self investment already carried out: 225.000,- €
These funds will be used to:
pitch luxury accommodation pods, i.e. 4 geodesic domes* 40-50 m², 1 yurt* 40 m², 3 tent-cabins 16 - 20 m², (* all insulated, including heating-system, furnishing & bathroom)
further co-finance reforestation and greening of the campsite with endemic plants
kickstart the construction, regardless of whether this campaign reaches its full target
improve all parts of the accommodation and invest in future alternative energy (small wind turbines), should the campaign exceed its goal
 
Become An ALONIWERK Supporter - the idea
With a holiday at ALONIWERK you support the development of soft tourism on the island. Furthermore, you are also helping to promote our idea of quality stays which in turn sends a strong message against the negative impact of mass tourism. A number of holiday destinations are now showing more awareness of this positive change. This is a critical moment of self-awareness for countries economically dependent on travellers. With your decision to enjoy your holiday with us, you become part of this change.
We have managed to win over the local community and we have convinced the building authorities with the ""green"" design of our campsite: Now it’s your turn!
 
 
Join Us and become part of our vision of a distinctive campsite on an unspoiled green island in the heart of Europe. In return for your generous investment, we will be pleased to offer you the opportunity to be the first guests to visit ALONIWERK - your home away from home.

What’s On Offer - holidays to happiness
You will camp with us in style, and we will show you the great outdoors, offering thrilling adventures that will be tonnes of fun! Upon your return, a cosy home awaits. We offer high-end comfort combined with the feeling of freedom and bespoke travel experiences.
 

 
We've got more cool perks in stock, for example several stunning photo art works from Tim, handmade designed art work from Nils, a range of culinary events, Alexandra's numerous anecdotes and hidden stories about the project, about the place and the island. ""The Wall of Thanks"" located within the campsite will be a tribute to our most generous donors together with ""Patrons of Aloniwerk"" olive trees planted in front of the main entrance. Make sure to look at all of our amazing perks.
Aside from the tangible perks, it is natural to us, as a family, to invite you to our fire with delicious red wine or a hot cup of cocoa under the starry sky.
 

 
Inspiring Perks - day trips, unity, joy and pleasure
We provide great day trips or tailored events to enhance your one or two week stay at ALONIWERK. Whether it be a tasty picnic with the vintner in their vine yard, or an exhilarating hike through scenic landscapes and beaches.
Our family is very skilled at creating imaginative holiday experiences. We arrange unique activities and excursions and produce creative photo & video material to make your vacation unforgettable.
We will take you to amazing places which we discovered ourselves when we started our personal ""greek holiday adventure"" in 1990.

 
More Than Just Rewards - a glimpse into our lives
Each one of us plays a vital role in creating ALONIWERK.
Tim has specialised in nature and landscape photography, and has an eye for breathtaking scenery. He has great passion for history and an uncanny sense for finding signs of bygone times, the common traveler is less likely to notice, such as ancient paths, traces of the mycenaean period, small Byzantine churches, hidden wells and caverns and ruins of former settlements.
Melina is the driving force in the background. With her friendly, calm and thoughtful nature, she ensures that nothing gets out of hand and that joy and creativity come first. Her skillset will ensure the smooth running of not only the project, but your experiences on your holiday.
Nils is gifted with enthusiasm, cheerfullness and immense creativity. Whether he is working as a drone operator, graphic designer or offering unique media workshops, he will guarantee fun and development.

Underwear that’s perfect for exploring the world or exploring the great indoors?
Undies that lounge, gym, & swim.
Because what’s the difference?
Why do we need to buy three bra tops for a single day of activities?
Why is it ok to post a picture of yourself in your bikini but not your underwear?
We think underwear should empower you, not limit you…
So we created SOMI: 
The breathable underwear that moves with you...
Because we’re always moving! 
We’re jumping in the pool, or hitting the trail, or getting in a quick yoga session.And we shouldn’t have to constantly change our undies to fit the occasion.Or worse, have to skip out on activities because we don’t have a swimsuit, or a sports bra, or a change of underwear.SOMI is the three-in-one solution that’s made from a sustainable version of Silk Jersey fabric. It’s breathable, antibacterial, moisture-wicking, quick-drying, supportive, comfortable, and always ready for your next activity. And that’s the way underwear should be!
So you can lounge in comfort at home 
So you’re ready for anything. 
So your bedroom drawers aren’t so crammed. 
So you can jump in the pool without the hassle of changing. 
So you can cool off in that hidden waterhole on your hike. 
So you can be free to focus on what matters. 
​So, seriously...what is the difference?What sets a swimsuit apart from a set of undies?And what makes SOMI a category apart?Well, swimsuits are generally made of cheap materials. They aren’t concerned with comfort, they aren’t meant to be worn close to the skin for extended periods of time, and they tend to feature:
Awkward ties, twists, and bumps. 
Loud colors and prints that show through clothing. 
Round strings rather than flat elastic straps. 
Absurdly high price tags (especially for something you only wear a few times a year).
 What about traditional underwear? It’s made from delicate, fragile lace that you have to wash carefully, and it’s much easier to tear. Or it’s a five-pack of cotton undies—generic, water-absorbent, and destined to show wear within a few washes.In the eco-conscious category, you can forget style and sexiness. It’s utilitarian, rugged, and often oddly shapeless.SOMI bridges this gap with stylish, comfortable, versatile classics made from an eco-friendly fabric that washes like a dream. We’ve always loved the idea of minimalism, but we wanted to offer our SOMI wearers the best of everything: The best workout underwear, the best swimwear, the best “I-just-want-to-be-comfortable-and-lounge-around-in-my-undies” wear. But how could we do that while still maintaining an eco-positive, minimalistic approach?The answer was simple: Create one functional (yet fashionable) set of undies that does it all.And make it durable enough to last for years to reduce your carbon footprint.  Wear SOMI for your next:Adventure
SOMI packs small, so throwing a spare pair in your day pack is easy. 
You’ll ALWAY have your swimsuit on you, so if you need to cool off in that hidden waterhole it’s A-okay. 
You won’t need to find a changing area on the trail (save time and stay safe!) 
Stay clean and fresh for longer, even after a long day of kayaking or cycling!
Workout
Unlike cotton underwear, which traps and logs sweat, SOMI underwear is moisture-wicking and quick drying. 
SOMI’s antibacterial properties are sweat activated to keep you fresh, even after a hard sweat. 
The Betty and The Deep Dive from our tops collection double as sports bras for low impact exercises like yoga, barre, and pilates. 
You can easily transition from lounging on your couch to your home workout. 
Swim
SOMI is UV and chlorine resistant. 
SOMI styles are designed with classic simple cuts that work for the beach, pool, and beyond. 
Save time and jump right in the pool! 
Lounge
Above all, SOMI is comfortable! 
No more wires, no more wedgies, no more sticky, sweaty material. 
Wear underneath your everyday clothing without worrying about panty lines.
 Did you know that fashion is a major contributor to pollution? In fact, 140 million pounds of clothes end up in landfills each year, and 20% of industrial water pollution is estimated to come from garment manufacturing.We care about the world we live in, so designing SOMI to be eco-friendly and ethically made wasn’t a decision we had to think twice about.What took a lot longer was coming up with an eco-conscious fabric that offered the water-resistance we needed, combined with the comfort we couldn’t live without.We partnered with a supplier of some of the best athletic and swimwear brands in the world, and we worked with them to develop a new antibacterial fabric that would hold up even better in the gym and on the road—anywhere you’re likely to sweat.The result was SustainLuxe: A material comparable to a sustainable version of Silk Jersey in its softness, flexibility, strength, and sheen—yet sustainably made and eco-friendly. And it's even constructed for maximum breathability so you stay comfortable no matter the activity.  SustainLuxe is: Best of all, SustainLuxe: But we didn’t stop there, because we wanted SOMI to be ethically made as well as eco-friendly. To this end, we’ve taken careful measures to vet all our suppliers to ensure their workers are treated fairly. SOMI wearers are practical, adventurous, and always ready to sweat—so we knew we had to make SOMI as resilient as they are.It had to be durable, long-lasting, and ready to stand up to the wear and tear of a life well-lived.It had to be easy to care for.And above all, it had to be ready to go at a moment’s notice. That’s why SOMI is:
Easy to hand wash (just wash in the sink with soap or shampoo, then roll into a towel and squeeze tightly). 
Resilient enough to throw directly into the laundry and dryer. 
Quick-drying, and tough enough to withstand heavy usage.
 All of our designs feature silky, breathable Sustainluxe fabric and are engineered to be supportive for low impact workouts like yoga and pilates. Our four-way stretch movement will keep you feeling comfortable day and night, and you’ll feel fresh for longer with antibacterial properties designed to last for up to 50 washes.Our bra band and waistband elastic is sourced from a luxury supplier. Since we’re selling directly to you, we can afford to add this expensive detail: It’s thin enough to not add bulk, but thick enough to give you the support you need.Our favorite part of this elastic is the hand feel. It feels as soft and silky as buttered kittens, and it doesn’t have that super shiny “I’m lingerie!” finish; instead, it’s a subtle sheen that lasts through grueling wash after wash.To effectively manage resources, we are offering our designs —all in black.  We tested SOMI on 243 women, sampled over 100 fabrics, and examined 50 bra band elastics before bringing our venture to crowdfunding. Why? Because we wanted SOMI to be perfect in every way—and we knew the only way to achieve that was by paying attention to the little details, then getting real feedback from the people who matter.Here’s what they had to say about their SOMI experiences: With SOMI, we’re creating a new category…It isn’t swimwear. It isn’t underwear. It isn’t yoga-wear…It’s all three.Here’s how SOMI compares to the status quo: Because our SOMI bra tops are designed with super-stretchy double-lined fabric, we recommend choosing your size based on your band measurement rather than your cup size. If in doubt, size down!Please note that some styles are only available in certain sizes, so make sure to look at the size availability when picking your preferred look.  It started with an email.“Hey,” it said. “Can I wear this underwear in the water? Like a bikini?”At this point, SOMI was just a vision and a website.We thought about it. What was the difference between underwear and swimwear, really? Our test line was already made from quick-dry fabric with sporty accents.“We don’t see why not,” we wrote back.Two days later, she sent a photo wearing her SOMI effortlessly in the water.Then we got another photo.And another.  Different women smiling and wearing their underwear proudly for everything from home workouts to hikes.And there was one hiker who did a week-long trip with only SOMI, wore it as a swimsuit, and washed it in the sink at night.We realized we were onto something.Fast-forward to today, and we’ve transformed our flagship line into something never seen before: A whole new category of designs intended to empower and embolden.We’re more than just a team of dreamers, though. We know how to bring products to market, how to deliver on our promises, and how to execute on manufacturing and production.So without further ado, meet our people:",41.0,0,"1 Campaign

Included the first tele presence hand manipulator system 
The mix between Robotics and Human Brains


Yori, is an Inca word meaning "" Dawn"" or in Japanese ""trustworthy"". Now is the name of a cybernetic machine that resembles a small astronaut, created by Robitz and ""Robots Crate"" (www.robitz.net,  www.robotscrate.com ). 

Finally we´ve developed ""Yori ""as a social robotics and ""Rent a Human Brain"" platform.

This humanoid machine has functions of ""remote control over internet""with remote programers, physician assistants, home assistants, care assistants and  human entertainment services. Besides it is one of the few robots that has capabilities of manipulation extensions for remote operation. 

Currently the first prototypes are guides at the exhibition ""Robots Crate"" Some pictures: www.robotscrate.com  
(Yori Expandable Arm)




Thanks to your collaborations through Indiegogo, Yori will be the new companion and assistant, the new pet or entertainment platform system, who will bring you the beer, pick up your clothes , clean the floor and dust shelves ( small scale, with a human brain operator behind him), but ""who"" also care and accompany adults, children and office workers. You can choose between autonomous mode or a super smart human brain to program or control your robot.
        What can your Yori Robot do?            You were not able to manipulate the world. !UNTIL NOW!.a) Autonomous mode: ""Programming form cero"".   Yori is like a child pet at home, an office assistant or sick and elderly companion. Do you remember Tamagotchi?. It's like a  real life one. When this robot says - ""I got something new"", he must  show a new ability, for sure. How does this work?. Well,  When Yori is unboxed, he has no programs or memories. ""He is like a new born child"". This machine will begin to learn from the first time to be turned on. Why?. Because we incorporate  a new way to program machines. This means to do that through observation and real interaction between humans and machines. So, we incorporate real human brains for programming your cybernetic friend. You'll have to take care of him, and he will take care of you.This will increase the posibilities.Besides,  Yori can be even better. You have some interesting features ahead, like ""Telepresence"" and ""Rent a Human Brain""  modes.b) Telepresence: Your human hands are connected directly to 
the brain. In fact much of it ( the brain) is intended for them ( your 
hands). This is the reason why you feel tied and imprisoned when 
controlling a robot camera online (just watching without taking 
control). But now Yori allows the use and manipulation of objects in the
 real world.  !So you are not prisoner of a webcam anymore!. Who said you can't be in to places at one?. Now Yori's articulated arms provides you  control over a  remote environment. c) Rent a Human Brain: On the other hand, you can contact and rent online specialist from Robitz network.They are (human) clinical advisors, medical advisers, (basic medical care only, not as physicians) for adults and children, Including assistant for disabled people, elderly or sick. Contact nannies that make the job via Yori. Controlling the robot for taking care of kids.  Models and Characteristics: Yori Black¿What is Yori made of?
The finished robot is made from acrylic resins with a tough , flexible and resistant film on injected plastic base , a compound that mimics the aged metal as an alternative material. Most part of the robots are hand made. 

Data network and shared control programs:  
Make each robot to 
improve their skills by sharing , ""programs"" that are generated in it ( 
¿or him?), like in other Yori units around the world .

We need  $58,000 to pay for the cost of everything that's needed to produce these robots, including bigger automated machinery.  The donations you give us will be used for molding, production, packaging and shipping of the product. It also goes to the improvement of electronic engineering , software for each robot and its functions as well as for hiring skilled personal in Human - Machine interactivity. In the other hand are legal and intellectual property issues required for this robot to get life. 


In return, you will get the coolest personal robot with awesome laser cut figures and LED lights, electronic control unit, video and infrared distance sensors, self charging station, access to robot apps ( rent human brains ) from Yori Cloud and the first arms telepresence operated system in a robot for home.  
With your help we will make the world most upgradeable robot with super intelligence inside because  of technicians brains behind each robot.  We'll be able to continuously update the machine, sharing ideas from other Yori robots and ultimately making them smarter.


The Robots Crate and Yori Black -  T Shirts 


If we achieve the goal or up to 30 % less than it, we will come closer to the goal of building the robot big assembly line for large-scale production. If we fail, we will deliver ordered robots as part of this campaign with all characteristics but yori cloud. This will be based on small assembly plant that we already have, but large scale production will be postposed. So your support is very, !very!  Important to accomplish this dream.

</div><p><b></b></p><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>As a former marine biologist, I learned a long time ago that
water is the most important element to sustain life.  Is not only vital
for us, but it is also critically vital for our pets.  It is extremely
important that our pets are drinking enough water every day and to take action
if we see any changes in their water intake.  These changes could be an
indication of a serious medical issue that we most investigate, but never
before were we able to know or figure out if our pets are drinking water or not. </p>
<p>That is why I created the <b>Pet-H2O </b>not only to provide your pet with
clean H<sub>2</sub>O but also to help you keep an accurate record of their
daily water intake.  Our <b>Pet-H2O </b>is in constant communication with our
mobile application, keeping an accurate record of your lovable pet’s water
intake, and it will immediately alert you if there are any drastic changes on
their water intake.  This is why our <b>Pet-H2O </b>is so important for us, our pets, and
our veterinarians.  We need your support
to begin manufacturing this year and to put a <b>Pet-H2O</b> in
every pet owner’s hands.  There is no need to keep letting our pets suffer
because we don't know when they started drinking less or too much water and are
now in a painful situation.  Let’s keep our pets healthier and close to
our hearts for years to come. Also we have made a commitment to help our local <b>Naples</b> <b>Humane Society</b> by donating <b>Pet-H2O</b> units and a percentage of all proceeds.</p>
<p>We are ready to <b>GOGO.</b><span> The funds will be use to finalize our

performed all testing on our product as well as its mobile application. We also

preserve two of the most historic buildings in Lethbridge’s Chinatown and help
ensure a piece of Alberta’s history is kept alive.</span>
<p>As long as these buildings stand, the
memories, stories and history of the early Chinese residents of southwestern
Alberta remain and the trials and triumphs of Chinatown are there for future
generations to learn about and from. Help provide the funds that will restore
these buildings and help convert them into an interpretive centre and public
space (as well as a residence) where the story of Alberta and Lethbridge’s
Chinese history can be told.</p>
<p>A group of concerned people and
organizations – working together under the Save Chinatown Lethbridge banner –
are raising money to save these buildings. </p>
<p>Each $1 raised is actually $2 of work on
the building! As these two buildings are Municipal Historic Resources, every $
we raise is eligible for matching grant funding. </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>What
We’re Protecting – Keeping People’s Stories Alive</b></p>
<p>The story of Lethbridge’s Chinatown –
indeed, the story of the Chinese in southwestern Alberta – is poorly understood
and has not been well told. The interpretive centre that is planned for the
buildings will help give an identity and a voice to these men and women of
southern Alberta’s past who for too long have been overlooked in the history
books and stories.</p>
<p>In addition to raising money to protect the
buildings and to build the exhibits, our group is researching the history of
the community and the individuals who lived in and interacted with Lethbridge’s
Chinatown in its heyday before the Second World War.</p>
<p>Here are just some of the names (we
apologize for errors in the names. These are the names as found in historic
documents and we are still trying to confirm spelling and proper names):</p>
<p>Joe Fong, John Lee, Mah Wing and Mah Ben –
in 1901 these four businessmen (laundrymen) wrote to the Town of Lethbridge
protesting the high cost of the laundry tax in Lethbridge. They provided
information on the amount of tax paid in other western communities. In the 1912 Directory of
the City of Lethbridge, Joe Fong is listed as a businessman at 308 1 Avenue
South.</p>
<p>In 1916, Joe Hop Wah, wife Dong and sons
See and Tai were all residing and working at 308 2 Avenue South. Joe, 48 years
old, was a cook and had been in Canada for 5 years.</p>
<p>Wong Ku Chong came from China in 1888 and
in 1916, at the age of 42, he was working as a cook in the coal mine camp at
Coal City north of Barnwell. </p>
<p>Ching Tow was 36 years old in 1916 and
working as a gardener in Raymond. He was married but from the 1916 census it
does not appear that his wife was with him in Canada. He had been in Canada for
10 years by this time and likely, as with so many other early immigrants, he
hadn’t seen his wife since his arrival in Canada.</p>
<p>Though we’re still researching and
cross-referencing, we have a list of over 250 names of early Chinese residents – your donation can help
ensure these people have a place in history.</p><p><br/></p>

Chinatown – This Place Matters</p>

in the early 1920s, dealing in Chinese goods. Since 1926 the building has been
the Bow On Tong – the Good Health Store – a Chinese apothecary, operated by the
Leong family. The building also provided residences for single Chinese men
living in the area. There were many single Chinese men as the head tax and
Chinese Immigration Act made it very difficult for Chinese women to move to
Canada so many of the men either never married or had to leave their wives and
children behind in China.</p>
<p>  The
Bow On Tong was a popular meeting site in Chinatown and played a significant
role in Chinese history in Lethbridge. The Bow On Tong was one of many sites in
Chinatown where gambling occurred. Gambling in Chinatown was about more than
just gambling. It was also part of the economic welfare of Chinese Canadians,
particularly single men who, as they aged and with no family members to help
them, needed someone else to help them out. Older men were used as runners for
the gambling games. It is a source of pride within the Chinese community that
no Chinese person in Lethbridge went on relief (welfare) during the Great
Depression even though the 1930s were known as the Hungry Thirties and were a
desperate time for many. </p>
<p>  Though
the building still has to be restored to its former glory,  a step inside the building takes you
immediately back into the past – the old wood floor, oiled and maintained over
decades. The drawers containing the apothecary medicines and supplies. Open
anyone and you’ll be surprised by what you find. The large windows that
beckoned to people on the street to come and view the displays will soon invite
people into the building to discover the interpretive centre and display area
telling the story of the early Chinese residents. Can you imagine a better place
anywhere to tell the story than this building?</p>
<p>Right next door
to the Bow on Tong is another treasured building. The Manie Opera Society/Kwong
On Lung &amp; Co. building is presently the oldest building in Lethbridge’s
Chinatown. The building has seen several uses over the years; the first tenant
was Wing Wah Chong Co., Chinese goods store. Wing Wah Chong was a president of
the Chinese National League in Lethbridge in the early part of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. The building also provided residences for many of the single men who
lived in the area. During the late 1910’s, the Kwong On Lung &amp; Co., a
Chinese grocery, and the Pekin Cafe operated in the building. By 1927, the
Canton Chop Suey restaurant was in operation. Due to discrimination, employment
opportunities for Chinese Canadians were limited and restaurants and market
gardening provided two avenues of employment. During the 1920’s there were 25
Chinese gardeners who went through Lethbridge selling vegetables door to door
from horse-drawn wagons. These gardeners, primarily single men, resided in the
buildings in Chinatown.</p>
<p>More recently
the building has continued to provide a venue supporting the Chinese Canadian
and Lethbridge community with such uses as: 
the New China Chop Suey, the Han Dynasty Importique, and the Chinese
Canadian cultural organization called the Manie Opera Society.</p>
<p>Lethbridge’s Chinatown provided services

<p><b>Albert
Leong and Family </b></p>
<p>Preserving these
buildings isn’t only about the history – it’s also about getting Albert home.
When these buildings were condemned, Albert Leong had to move out of his home.
Born in the Bow On Tong, Albert has lived his entire life in Lethbridge’s
Chinatown and he remains a living memory of the lives of all of the people who
have made Chinatown home over many decades.</p>
<p>Way Leong
emigrated from Hong Kong to Vancouver. In Vancouver he operated a Chinese
pharmacy (apothecary). In 1921 he was joined in Vancouver by his wife Florence
(Ho). It was fortunate that Florence had arrived before 1923 because starting
in that year the Chinese Immigration Act made it nearly impossible for Chinese
men to bring wives to Canada. This Act, the cost of head tax and discriminatory
immigration policies meant that the number of Chinese in Alberta actually
dropped between 1921 (3581) and 1931 (3211).  The Leongs, though, defied the odds and moved
to Lethbridge in 1926 where Way Leong opened the Bow On Tong Co. Bow On Tong
translates as good health store and is a rare Chinese apothecary filled with
objects from China and the Vancouver store. </p>
<p>Through their
perseverance they created a viable Chinese goods business in Lethbridge and
worked to help build a social and cultural community for the Chinese Canadians
of southwestern Alberta. Florence Leong operated the store when her husband was
ill and following his death. A road in Legacy Ridge (where all roads and parks
are named after women of southern Alberta history) was named in her honour.</p><p><br/></p>

Canada were prominent in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup>

of the Chinese therefore worked in laundries, restaurants, as servants and in
other similar jobs.</p>
<p>In Lethbridge, several

southwestern Alberta. </span></p>
<p>Discriminatory practices against Chinese Canadians started to decrease in the 1940s. China and
Canada were allies during the Second World War and Canada’s immigration
policies and practices started to change around this time. With the changes, the
Chinese in Lethbridge were able to live anywhere in the city and new businesses
and professions were open to new Chinese immigrants. Lethbridge's Chinatown lost some of its prominence. As buildings were lost and people moved

preserve two of the most historic buildings in Lethbridge’s Chinatown and help
ensure a piece of Alberta’s history is kept alive.
As long as these buildings stand, the
memories, stories and history of the early Chinese residents of southwestern
Alberta remain and the trials and triumphs of Chinatown are there for future
generations to learn about and from. Help provide the funds that will restore
these buildings and help convert them into an interpretive centre and public
space (as well as a residence) where the story of Alberta and Lethbridge’s
Chinese history can be told.
A group of concerned people and
organizations – working together under the Save Chinatown Lethbridge banner –
are raising money to save these buildings. 
Each $1 raised is actually $2 of work on
the building! As these two buildings are Municipal Historic Resources, every $
we raise is eligible for matching grant funding. 
What
We’re Protecting – Keeping People’s Stories Alive
The story of Lethbridge’s Chinatown –
indeed, the story of the Chinese in southwestern Alberta – is poorly understood
and has not been well told. The interpretive centre that is planned for the
buildings will help give an identity and a voice to these men and women of
southern Alberta’s past who for too long have been overlooked in the history
books and stories.
In addition to raising money to protect the
buildings and to build the exhibits, our group is researching the history of
the community and the individuals who lived in and interacted with Lethbridge’s
Chinatown in its heyday before the Second World War.
Here are just some of the names (we
apologize for errors in the names. These are the names as found in historic
documents and we are still trying to confirm spelling and proper names):
Joe Fong, John Lee, Mah Wing and Mah Ben –
in 1901 these four businessmen (laundrymen) wrote to the Town of Lethbridge
protesting the high cost of the laundry tax in Lethbridge. They provided
information on the amount of tax paid in other western communities. In the 1912 Directory of
the City of Lethbridge, Joe Fong is listed as a businessman at 308 1 Avenue
South.
In 1916, Joe Hop Wah, wife Dong and sons
See and Tai were all residing and working at 308 2 Avenue South. Joe, 48 years
old, was a cook and had been in Canada for 5 years.
Wong Ku Chong came from China in 1888 and
in 1916, at the age of 42, he was working as a cook in the coal mine camp at
Coal City north of Barnwell. 
Ching Tow was 36 years old in 1916 and
working as a gardener in Raymond. He was married but from the 1916 census it
does not appear that his wife was with him in Canada. He had been in Canada for
10 years by this time and likely, as with so many other early immigrants, he
hadn’t seen his wife since his arrival in Canada.
Though we’re still researching and
cross-referencing, we have a list of over 250 names of early Chinese residents – your donation can help
ensure these people have a place in history.

<h3>The Orb Story</h3>
<p>My name is Andrew Phillips, and I've been cycle commuting in the UK for almost 10 years. In that time, I've had dozens of near misses (and been knocked off once) - from vehicles approaching from the side.

birthday. As this governing body begins a second century of existence it
 is an increasingly interesting and important time to examine the 
condition of our parks as environmental, economic and political factors 
threaten their status. <br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Effects felt from climate change are at the forefront. Glacier National Park in Montana, for instance, home to over 150 glaciers in the 
mid-19th century, now contains only 25, all of which have seen dramatic 
reductions in overall volume. At current rates, scientists predict this 
U.S. park, named after its many glaciers, will contain no more by the year 2030, possibly 
earlier.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The economics of our park system is another important matter. Just this February the Park Service reported a maintenance backlog deficit of almost $12 billion dollars, meaning roads, campgrounds, visitor's centers and trails in need of work are not receiving them. This translates to an increased risk of personal injury, potential damage to both private and public property, a cultural loss of certain structures along with resource damage to the environment itself. <br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are also movements on a political level regarding who controls these park lands and what uses are permitted in them. A bill introduced by two U.S. Senators, for example, looks to potentially give bicycle access to wilderness areas within national parks and other public lands, going against a 1964 directive which defined and allowed for public wilderness.<br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Environmental changes, economic impacts and political movements are just a few of the many complex, very delicate, greatly layered issues the parks currently confront, making the start of a new century a particularly appropriate time for <i>THE PARKS ARE CALLING</i>.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472248256/indie-01_lhq8fw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I had the good fortune of working on some of these public lands in

Alaska, working with these organizations provided the opportunity to

Through the lenses of photography and outdoor recreation, this project will create a public space providing education, generating inspiration and encouraging the use of our collective voices to protect these lands we all own.Traveling through forty-six 
states and two territories, THE PARKS ARE CALLING departs northwestern Illinois on September 25, 2016, 
heading north to Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota. Continuing in a 
clockwise direction from here this project will continue until October 2017, with the following objectives:To employ photography in documenting lands operated by the National Park Service at its centennial, creating a photographic collection of each unit explored. Making these images
publicly accessible online, a stretch goal of THE PARKS ARE CALLING
 is the production of a physical exhibit and corresponding book with
 the aim of bringing continued public interest and awareness to these lands.To build an online community through the use of digital platforms where interested parties can follow and participate in this journey. Through THE PARKS ARE CALLING
 the intention is to educate, inspire and encourage champions of our 
parks
such that these lands and their possessions continue for future generations.BackgroundOn August 25, 2016, the National Park Service celebrated its 100th 
birthday. As this governing body begins a second century of existence it
 is an increasingly interesting and important time to examine the 
condition of our parks as environmental, economic and political factors 
threaten their status. Effects felt from climate change are at the forefront. Glacier National Park in Montana, for instance, home to over 150 glaciers in the 
mid-19th century, now contains only 25, all of which have seen dramatic 
reductions in overall volume. At current rates, scientists predict this 
U.S. park, named after its many glaciers, will contain no more by the year 2030, possibly 
earlier.The economics of our park system is another important matter. Just this February the Park Service reported a maintenance backlog deficit of almost $12 billion dollars, meaning roads, campgrounds, visitor's centers and trails in need of work are not receiving them. This translates to an increased risk of personal injury, potential damage to both private and public property, a cultural loss of certain structures along with resource damage to the environment itself. There are also movements on a political level regarding who controls these park lands and what uses are permitted in them. A bill introduced by two U.S. Senators, for example, looks to potentially give bicycle access to wilderness areas within national parks and other public lands, going against a 1964 directive which defined and allowed for public wilderness.Environmental changes, economic impacts and political movements are just a few of the many complex, very delicate, greatly layered issues the parks currently confront, making the start of a new century a particularly appropriate time for THE PARKS ARE CALLING.I had the good fortune of working on some of these public lands in 
partnership with the Student Conservation Association and National Park 
Service. Entrusted with co-leading youth in outdoor education through 
building and maintaining hiking trails in Colorado and 
Alaska, working with these organizations provided the opportunity to 
experience and learn how protected lands in the park system operate. Our
 field work also instilled in me a greater appreciation for these 
majestic places along with a more intense desire to understand, explore 
and document units I had not seen firsthand.Campaign
The past seven months have been an all-consuming labor of love as I have carried out logistical and creative planning, working to make 
this vision into a tangible enterprise. Now, the time has come to get others involved in THE PARKS ARE CALLING! Undertaking an expedition of this depth and magnitude, dedicating more than a year on the road to this project requires serious investments. Putting in my time, energy and personal financial resources, I have committed myself to this project's success. I am, however, in need of assistance. To achieve the desired outcomes, THE PARKS ARE CALLING is looking to raise $25,000. These funds will be dedicated to the following earmarked categories:

<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>We have recently successfully funded our idea as a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to pay for molds which are often the most expensive investment. In order to offer more color options to our backers, we are running an INDIEGOGO campaign.</p>
<p>Our goal of $10,000 will allow several production runs, resulting in 3 separate color options that will be available. If we raise less than $10,000, the product will still ship in our standard lime green color. If we raise $10,000 or more we will be offering the Grip’enGo Hydration System in 3 separate colors, 2 of which will be chosen through a backer survey immediately following the campaign. Your choice of bite valve and suction tube will be available through the post campaign survey as well. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Here are the reasons we love Grip'enGo:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is durable</li>
<li>It is compact</li>
<li>It is lightweight</li>
<li>It is easy to use</li>
<li>It is easy to clean</li>
<li>It can be used with any liquid</li>
<li>It can be used in any backpack</li>
<li>It can be used with any small mouth water bottle </li>
<li>It doesn't leak (medical grade check valve)</li>
</ul>
<h3>SPECIFICATIONS</h3>

</div><div>
<h3>The Deal</h3>
<p>I need your help!! Plastic injection molds are expensive, especially for tight tolerance parts like the parts within Grip'enGo. When I meet my campaign goal, I will be able to economically manufacture the Grip'enGo components. As a result you will be able to take one on your next adventure!! Grip'enGo takes the hassle and mildew out of hydration systems. You need a one for your next trip!</p>

</div></div>","Backstory
We have recently successfully funded our idea as a Kickstarter campaign and raised enough money to pay for molds which are often the most expensive investment. In order to offer more color options to our backers, we are running an INDIEGOGO campaign.
Our goal of $10,000 will allow several production runs, resulting in 3 separate color options that will be available. If we raise less than $10,000, the product will still ship in our standard lime green color. If we raise $10,000 or more we will be offering the Grip’enGo Hydration System in 3 separate colors, 2 of which will be chosen through a backer survey immediately following the campaign. Your choice of bite valve and suction tube will be available through the post campaign survey as well. 
 
Here are the reasons we love Grip'enGo:

It is durable
It is compact
It is lightweight
It is easy to use
It is easy to clean
It can be used with any liquid
It can be used in any backpack
It can be used with any small mouth water bottle 
It doesn't leak (medical grade check valve)

SPECIFICATIONS


The Deal
I need your help!! Plastic injection molds are expensive, especially for tight tolerance parts like the parts within Grip'enGo. When I meet my campaign goal, I will be able to economically manufacture the Grip'enGo components. As a result you will be able to take one on your next adventure!! Grip'enGo takes the hassle and mildew out of hydration systems. You need a one for your next trip!

<p>Tra il 1887 e il 1888 circa millecinquecento italiani salparono da Genova verso Puerto Limòn, Costa Rica, per lavorare alla realizzazione del ""Ferrocarril al Atlantico"". <strong>Un viaggio della speranza che per molti si trasformò in un incubo</strong>. Morirono a decine, e le condizioni di lavoro furono talmente disumane da portare gli italiani ad organizzare il primo storico sciopero del paese centroamericano.</p>
<p>Dall'estate 2018 stiamo visitando decine di archivi e biblioteche, <strong>costruendo per la prima volta un database sui protagonisti di questa storia</strong> per tentare di individuare i loro discendenti in Costa Rica o in Italia. Molti furono infatti quelli che tornarono dopo la realizzazione della ferrovia.</p>
<p><strong>Gennaio 2019 sarà l'inizio del viaggio vero e proprio</strong>: da Milano raggiungeremo il porto di Anversa (Belgio), da cui salperemo sull'Atlantic Sky (una nave cargo) verso Liverpool. Da lì comincerà la traversata dell'Oceano Atlantico, che in una decina di giorni ci porterà allo sbarco in Canada, ad Halifax, da cui proseguiremo per il Costa Rica. A Puerto Limòn sarà la volta del treno merci fino a Siquirres, dove da vent'anni la linea percorribile si interrompe. Da lì a Cartago cammineremo sui binari e sui ponti ferroviari realizzati anche dai nostri antenati, raccogliendo testimonianze e vissuti dei discendenti sparsi nei villaggi nati attorno al treno.</p>

</div></div>","About this projectWelcome bike lovers! I hope You watched my video. My name is Kamil, creator of ""V-Bike"", app that can easily replace traditional bike computers. Goals were obvious - this should be fast, optimized, battery friendly app which does not require a internet connection and which does not contain disturbing ads:The first version was published in January this year, it was a just regular bike computer and hardly anyone knew about it. V-Bike 1.0.0 were the results of the entire 2014 summer programming and testing. Since then I have corrected few bugs and improved compatibility with the latest Windows Phone system for mobile phones, added altimeter functions (1.0.1) and s.o.s button (1.0.2).



Bike functions:

Current speed
Average speed
Maximum speed
Current distance
Total distance
Current time of trip
Total hours spent on bike
Current altitude
Maximum altitude
Climb uphill

Additional functions:



Current time
Flashlight (personally I use this function as additional lighting at night)
S.O.S message (creates a message with gps coordinates)


General functions:

Autosave
Toggle metric or imperial units
Running at background
Running with screen off
Reset button (clear all records and restore default settings)
Overwriting total distance (rewriting from old device)
Battery friendly and optimized algorithms
The status bar stays on top (informs about the text messages and calls)
Autostart




Requirements:



Just any Windows Phone 8/8.1 device with GPS receiver.

Less than 1MB of free space
Led flashligt (flashlight function)





Try it for free!
    Download from Windows Phone Store here, or scan QR code:

Help
Writing such an application requires the dedication of many hours of work. In addition to be able to become a windows phone developer and have the ability to emulate created programs, I was forced to buy the Windows 8.1 Pro system (~250$), having an account on the Microsoft site is 19$ per year, app promotion/advertising cost me about 40$. It's costs that I have put into this project. I need to raise money to keep the app free from fee and adverts.

If you can't support the project financially, please share this page with others on Facebook, Twitter or Google+:



I wish my application had language support for other countries..If you can help with translate, please download excel file here. You can send the completed file to the V-Bike official Facebook page here or just e-mail me at vbikeapp@gmail.com.



(With Your help I already added Italian and Ukrainian languages! I can't wait for more : )! Thank You! German language will come soon!)

Any help is important to me and will be appreciated and any person who will support the project will be marked on fb.com/vbikeapp page as honorable mention. 

I’m looking for 2015 & 2016 sponsors
In gratitude I will put your logo with link to your web page in 480x200 format inside my app, in settings menu. Logo will be there until the end of the year 2015/2016.
Sample:



Where Does the Money Go?
Of course the further promotion and development of the application. My plan is to create more functions like:

improve altimeter functions (10% complete)


settings menu (95% complete) COMPLETED!



autostart function (0% complete) COMPLETED!


driving angle (85% complete)  COMPLETED!




compass (5% complete)


multi-language support (35% complete) Polish, Italian, Ukrainian and Germany LANGUAGE ADDED!




backlight themes (60% complete)
      and more..

calories burned (0% complete)
temperature (0% complete)
saving and loading all new settings (20% complete)


Still are not convinced?

Let's take a look at a small comparison..






Hope You like it. Have fun with the V-Bike!

Forest (BMF) property in Braintree, Vermont that Kendall and Rives had recently donated to NEFF.<span>  In the fall of 2014, over 35 RASTA volunteers spent a weekend cutting RASTA’s

<p>This past spring, RASTA

<h3>Thanks For Checking Out Our Project!</h3>
<p>We are Gina (18) and Arjuna (19) a young filmmaking/photographing couple from the Netherlands. For our newest project, will be filming a documentary, start vlogging and publishing photos. But why is this so different than all the other folks doing this, you might ask. This is a mobile project, filmmaking from the perspective of two young nomadic supertramps!</p>
<p>This journey will take us all across Europe. From the Netherlands, to the Arctic and back down to the Spain, through more than 21 different countries! A distance of over 9000 miles (15000km to be exact) and we expect it to take us 6 months to make the trip and film all the footage for both the documentary and our vlogs. We have always been dreaming about traveling the globe for a living. So we want to make our career as ""Digital Nomads"". With our first project, this will be a first step into the rest of our new lives! </p>
<h3><strong>What’s Our Plan? </strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>In May 2017, we want to embark on a trip with a campervan (which we will convert ourselves) from the Netherlands to North Cape (Norway, north) and from Scandinavia after the summer to Tarifa (Spain, south). </p>
<h3>The Documentary</h3>
<p>In this film we will visit different innovative projects around the continent that help creating a cleaner and more sustainable future for us all. We believe that there are alternative ways of keeping our productivity up, as a human race, but without hurting the planet we actually live on. We expect the documentary will air the first week of January 2018.</p>
<h3>New Kids On The Vlog</h3>
<p>We will be blogging weekly and daily upload via Instagram. Our YouTube videos will be uploaded twice a week (if we get the hang of it, we’ll try doing it daily).</p>
<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>After the trip, we will transform all the photographs taken on the trip into a beautiful photobook of wonders. It will feature high quality imagery you can also order printed on premium metal. Follow us on <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/travelingterranauts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.instagram.com/travelingterranauts</a> or visit our website <a href=""http://www.travelingterranauts.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.travelingterranauts.com</a> for our latest photographs. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Will Your Donation Do For The Project?</h3>
<p>Even though we will be living on a budget and saving money prior to the start of this project, we need some financial support in order to get this traveling manifestation of goodness off the ground. Don't worry, we will be penny-pinching as expected of two Dutchies. </p>
<p>But for the one still doubting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuel to make those miles (kilometers as we prefer to measure, but miles sound cooler)</li>
<li>Conversion materials for the bus</li>
<li>Several nutritious substances we call 'food' and hygiene (to hide our human odors through the camera)</li>
<li>And of course the amazing rewards we will be sending you!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>Those prizes are exposed on the right side of this page, you'll love 'em!</p>
<h3>Your Contribution Makes A Change!</h3>
<p>Even if you are not at all interested in the trip, you should make a donation anyway. Why? Because in our documentary we want to raise awareness for climate change, the current state of our planet and how we can try to fix it. So if we want our (grand)children to grow up on a healthy planet, we should start getting our message out RIGHT NOW!</p>
<p>We have come a long way from where we started, and our narrow timeframe motivates us to keep taking big steps. We have faith our project will succeed and we will reach our own goals as well!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Story Has No Worst Case Scenario</h3>
<p>But we do want to inform you there might be some complications that could cause a delay or change of plans.</p>
<ul>
<li>A major car accident will definitely be a major issue if it comes to delivering our product on time</li>
<li>Even if our relationship would end at some point on this trip, we agreed to finish it as professionals.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help Without Donating Money</h3>
<p>For those of you who can not provide shiny ducats to the expedition we have listed some ways you can help us out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our project on (all of) your social media</li>
<li>If you'd like your music/(fan)art to be featured in our videos in exchange for a nice credit, please contact us</li>

<h3>Hello, my name is Ryan.  Im a Airbnb ""Experience"" Host in Los Angeles.  Airbnb experiences are activities that you can book with local people.   Its a new program that airbnb is using to market to their 40 million guests worldwide.  I offer an experience that teaches kiteboarding.   In the last three weeks I have had 3500 people wanting to book, that's over 300,000 dollars of work and I can not accommodate this many people.</h3>
<h3>When I submitted the ""kiteboarding experience""  I had no idea my passion was going to take over my life.  What an amazing gift. I love kiteboarding and I love to share that with interesting and amazing people.  With airbnb behind me as one of their top hosts in the world I want to make this expeience into the best kiteboarding school on the west coast.  With your help we can do it together.  Airbnb will advertise and reach the masses for us.  They have already posted me in forbes.com</h3>

<h3>They are also planning more marketing for me by the end of the month. They even have a film crew coming this week!!! With airbnb as my marketing arm I believe this Kiteboarding school can bring so much fun and happiness to people in Los Angeles.  </h3>

<h3>15,000 will go to getting a van that will transport even more equipment so we can double our class size and increase our profits.</h3>
<h3>10,000 will go to getting a second instructor and act as my co-host on the experience team.</h3>
<h3>Then the last 25,000 will go to getting a zodiac inflatable boat so we can take the class to the wind and never cancel a experience.</h3>
<h3>If we raise more money than our goal we want to buy equipment and set up a structure at the beach. This structure will need to be coordinated with the city and county and will have legal fees.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>This school will add so much enjoyment to many people from all walks of life but the real service is adding an experience that you wouldn't be able to do as of now. There is no risk of this school failing right now with airbnb behind us and bookings already into october of 2017.  All I want is to step it up to the professional level that I know this school can become.  So please get the word out and share this with as many people that you know.

<p>We are the Tara Rokpa

environment. This year our focus is on environment. We are building environmentally-friendly structures and
developing a permaculture project to grow organic food and medicinal plants.</p>
<p>Our book “With Earth
in Mind” documents the eco-building central to the establishment of the centre,
as well as showcasing the natural surroundings and the other environmental

eco-buildings are told almost as an analogy of what it means to be a practicing
Kagyu Buddhist, where all joy and pain are taken onto the path. The wonderful

irrational, and yet a stronghold, a refuge that you can depend upon as you
struggle along this path called life. </p>

And that’s why it remained so dull and uncomfortable for decades. Do you really think this is the best way to carry your luggage?  Humanity used baskets and boxes before backpack or tote bag were born. The improvement of transportation led people to pack more stuff. Bags became too big and heavy to carry by themselves. People needed to find more efficient way to carry it.RAWROW focuses on the essentialities of products. And we defined the trunk as a tool that helps people carry and move easily. R TRUNK is our solution to carry heavy things with ease that contains our obsession to the essentiality of bag, including the bar handle which has never been changed for decades.  R TRUNK was released at one of the representative online shops in Korea.RAWROW is originally famous for bags, shoes and glasses among Korean fashion market. And the first luggage we made is already proven by Korean no.1 customers’ reviews.  R TRUNK was highlighted at Japan along with success in Korea. Japanese thriving shops like ZOZO TOWN and MONOCO started to sell our goods and LOFT held pop-up store for us at Shibuya and Ginza. We were invited to a showcase to introduce Korean good brands and showed off R TRUNK.  R TRUNK helps you focus only on your journey when you stay or move. Business trip, short travel and long journey… Are you preparing for any kinds of traveling?R TRUNK will be your best companion to organize and pack whatever your purpose is. It’s way harder when you are with your heavy luggage even though it’s your everyday path.R TRUNK will lessen the burden on your wrist, and noise on the road as well. HINOMOTO Lisof WheelR TRUNK uses Japanese low noise wheels called ‘HINOMOTO Lisof Wheel’ which reduces 20dB on the road compared to other brands’ luggage. It also turns 360° smoothly so you can control it easily. The truth that you have to carry so many things doesn’t mean that you may exceed the weight limit. You need to weigh it whenever and wherever you are. Scale HandleJust pick it up and put it down. You’ll see how precise it is.* Only for 63L, 88L models* Between 6.6lbs and 88lbs available   (error range: under 33lbs: ± 1.1lbs / over 33lbs ± 3%~4%)* LR44 bettery used HIDDEN POCKETYou can keep your ticket, passport or a map here and take them out whenever you need.You can also check whether they are safe with your own eyes. BAR HANDLEYou can hang your bag, jacket or umbrella on the bar handle to free your hands. Your luggage will have to endure poor environment at over 30,000ft high during your flight. Low temperature, bumping into other luggage… R TRUNK will keep your stuff safe no matter what happens. 
BAYER Polycarbonate Body and Aluminum Frame​
Body is made of anti-shock German BAYER polycarbonate. The application of Aluminum frame keeps shape of body and protects from various impacts. PolycarbonatePolycarbonate is super light and extra strong material and is being used at high-end luggage. It is 250, 150 and 30 times stronger than plate glass, tempered glass and acrylic respectively. Shock resistance, thermal resistance, weatherproof, self-extinguishability and transparency. Durability testMileage Test (Stroll 20km with 7kg loaded) Tumble Test (Tumbled 100 Cycles at uneven ground) Drop Test (Dropped from 90cm high testing impact on wheels and edges) Jerk Test (Dropped 2000 times with its handle pulled out) TSA LockLuggage locks approved by the TSA(Transportation Security Administration).Only the TSA have a universal master key that will open the locks without breaking it.How to Reset Your Lock1.

<p><strong>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT:</strong></p>
<p>Our initial designs and developments for <strong>Travel Buddy </strong>started around a year ago, after many years of travel time nothing was comfortable and convenient for traveling. The donut shape travel pillow its designed to rest your neck side ways, but not to ensure proper posture while resting your neck. Our <strong>Travel Buddy</strong>, does all the above: rest, proper posture and keeps you from waking up every time your neck tilts the wrong way. </p>

<p><strong>Shape and design: Travel Buddy </strong>We first got the idea after we tried on a friend's medical cervical collar. While medical cervical collar's primary function it is to treat neck pain, and neck pain being one of the  most prominent and costly health problems in the United States we realized an immediate need for its usage and purpose. Around 50-70% of United States citizens will experience neck pain at least once in their lives. </p>

<p><strong>KEY COMPONENTS: </strong><br/><strong>Balance: </strong>We realized that keeping a balanced neck while resting may help with neck and shoulder pain after hours of travel. </p>
<p><strong>Comfort: </strong>the extra cushion as well as the wrap around the entire neck will increase the level of comfort enabling your body and mind to secure a superior rest. </p>

<p><strong>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Travel Buddy</strong> is wrapped round the neck for supporting the head during long-haul traveling. Most of the neck cushion (U-shaped) can only support the neck on its back. But Travel Buddy will provide an all-round support. Therefore the user will feel refreshed even after a nap during long journey.</p>
<p><strong>The high quality foam molds to the natural curves of your body to provide truly custom comfort</strong>. Travel Buddy will help relieve the stress on your neck and shoulders from sitting for extended periods while traveling. It is perfect for the plane, train, bus, car, or even for watching TV at home!</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to Travel Buddy

 
We are a Swedish-American based company that its primary focus is to develop a product that ensures travelers of all kinds to rest while on long-haul trips away from home.               
                         Our products were designed in California, Made in Sweden                                       

            
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT:
Our initial designs and developments for Travel Buddy started around a year ago, after many years of travel time nothing was comfortable and convenient for traveling. The donut shape travel pillow its designed to rest your neck side ways, but not to ensure proper posture while resting your neck. Our Travel Buddy, does all the above: rest, proper posture and keeps you from waking up every time your neck tilts the wrong way. 
                         
                        A standard travel pillow




Shape and design: Travel Buddy We first got the idea after we tried on a friend's medical cervical collar. While medical cervical collar's primary function it is to treat neck pain, and neck pain being one of the  most prominent and costly health problems in the United States we realized an immediate need for its usage and purpose. Around 50-70% of United States citizens will experience neck pain at least once in their lives. 

 
KEY COMPONENTS: Balance: We realized that keeping a balanced neck while resting may help with neck and shoulder pain after hours of travel. 
Comfort: the extra cushion as well as the wrap around the entire neck will increase the level of comfort enabling your body and mind to secure a superior rest. 
Quality:  The high quality foam molds to the natural curves of your neck to provide truly custom comfort.

                                                                   

        


 
SAMPLE VIDEO OF USAGE: 


Travel buddy is designed & shaped for traveling, inspired by medical cervical collar


PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:
Travel Buddy is wrapped round the neck for supporting the head during long-haul traveling. Most of the neck cushion (U-shaped) can only support the neck on its back. But Travel Buddy will provide an all-round support. Therefore the user will feel refreshed even after a nap during long journey.
The high quality foam molds to the natural curves of your body to provide truly custom comfort. Travel Buddy will help relieve the stress on your neck and shoulders from sitting for extended periods while traveling. It is perfect for the plane, train, bus, car, or even for watching TV at home!

PICK YOUR FAVORITE COLOR GREY or PURPLE



Travel Buddy has a side pocket for you to keep your credit cards or your phone safe.

Hoodie Travel Buddy, Incognito Edition 

PRODUCT EDITIONS: You will have access to a plain Travel Buddy or the Incognito Edition which it includes a hoodie.

<p>Texto en español debajo! :) (turn on the subtitles on the video)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Warmifonias is a project involving five women: Sofy, Guaytamba, Gene, Dani and Paty (joined the project after the video recording). We all share the same dream: to travel by bicycle!</p>
<p>Sofy, 32 years old, is a city planner and works in education. She has been teaching other women how to ride the bicycle in the city for six years.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485735332/kkqxzrziwqzvxkacyy1r.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Guaytamba (actually her name is Sofi as well), 28 years old,  an architect who also loves to illustrate.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485735080/xijauwiucccwvonftmf4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Gene, 35 years old, has worked with women in holistic reproductive health since 2006</p>

<p>Dani, 26 years old, designs urban cycling apparel and loves to take pictures.</p>

<p>Paty, 25 years old, is a geographer and loves teaching - learning processes.</p>
<p>Each of us dreamt of travelling by bike, and we met each other step by step in different situations.</p>
<p>Dani and Sofy met Guaytamba through a polish cyclo tourist that was staying at her home. From the very beginning they decided to do this trip and project together. Later on, Gene joined the project without doubting it a second. Finally, Paty knew about the project and decided to join us as well.</p>
<p>This is how we ended being 5 women turning this project into a reality!</p>

Sharing this experiences is the key to making new transformations!<br/>We share our content at <a href=""http://www.warmifonias.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Warmifonias Blog,</a><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/warmifonias"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Warmifonias Facebook </a>and other transmedia channels.</li>
<li>Your support in this project helps demystifying how women travel and live in South America. Also it helps promote cycling as a way of transportation.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What we need and what our sponsors will get in return?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We will need enough food and water (because this will be using our feet for transportation), having safe equipment and insurance. We plan on the 7 month trip to need aprox. $18,000 USD. Fortunately, we've saved for basic expenses already, but we still need your help to cover other expenses!</li>
<li>The money will be used mainly for buying food from local producers in each rural community we visit. </li>
<li>After the trip, we will publish a digital book about our findings and we will do a photo exhibition of the story and illustrations of these inspiring women around South America.</li>
</ul>
<p> If we achieve our goal, 90% of the fundings will go to support the trip and 10% toward the digital release of research results.</p>
<ul><li>If you support us, we want to reward you with special gifts : customized pictures, original illustrations, exclusive content of our trip, your name in our final digital and physical publications.</li></ul>
<p>If we don't achieve our goal of $18,000, all collected funds will go towards  the trip’s basic expenses.</p>
<h3><strong>The impact </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Through us, the women we will be visiting will find a new channel to make their voices heard. Meanwhile, our visit and the final publication, are important ways to recognize  the value of what these women are doing for their communities.</li>
<li>In the other hand we want to share this network with you and many other people around the world, in that way, we can help many little ideas grow with inspiration and thank of this knowledge exchange!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Record of Success</strong></h3>
<p>Three of us are part of a volunteering woman-based group called ""Carishina en Bici"" since 2010. This group is based in Quito, Ecuador. We had planned street races, workshops and the amazing urban bicycle school called ""God Mother in bike"" that helps women of all ages to start riding bikes in the city. The impact with our action has created over 600 new women riders.</p>
<p><a href=""http://carishinaenbici.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://carishinaenbici.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>Gene has created a project that helps hundred of women a year called ""Lunas"" (translates to moons in English), a project promoting the use of ecological sanitary towels.  </p>

<h3>
<strong>Risks and challenges</strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> </span>
</h3>
<p>We are knowledgable and aware of the risks that are included with travel. We will be traveling with no support car behing us, we will carry our tents, stoves and gear all by ourselves. There is limited education and respect for the cyclists in South America. Our biggest concern is that many people in South America see us as a very vulnerable just for the fact of being women. Finally, physic,health risks and bad climate are other risky factors we can't ignore, but will do our best to mitigate.</p>
<p>One of the principal focuses we have learned over the years with cycling is <strong>persistence</strong>. We believe that is one of our main strengths and we are also capable to see all the risks as challenges to overcome during this trip. We will overcome!</p>
<p>Our largest strength is to be multi-disciplinary. Together we cover knowledgement on many areas: bike mechanic, healthy nutrition, alternative therapies, comunication and social media skills, bilingual language. Our diverse backgrounds play well together in forming a unified team.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have planned our route day by day, that way we can communicate our followers where we are and when we are going.</li>
<li>We have researched and purchased our equipment with professional advice. </li>
<li>We have talked and travel with a lot of cycle tourists whom have completed similar routes. </li>
<li>We will travel with an international insurance.</li>
<li>We are part of an international cyclist community network (<a href=""https://www.warmshowers.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">warmshowers.org</a>) that is a free worldwide hospitality exchange for touring cyclists. That way we will be covered in many cities we will visit.</li>
<li>We have already interviewed two women in our home city of Quito. Our project is already underway! </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Other ways you can help us:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign! We want as many people as possible to be aware of this project.  </li>
<li>If you know projects in South America that involve badass women, send them to us. We would love to visit!</li>
<li>If you have friends living somewhere in our rute, please help us contacting them! So we can find good places to sleep or stay. :)</li>
</ul>
<p>____________</p>
<p>Warmifonias somos cinco amigas: Sofy, Guaytamba, Gene, Dani y Paty , quien se unió al proyecto después de la grabación del video. Todas con un mismo sueño, viajar en bicicleta!</p>
<p>Sofy, 32 años, es urbanista y trabaja en educación. Lleva 6 años enseñando a otras mujeres a pedalear en la ciudad.</p>
<p>Guaytamba, 28 años, (que en realidad se llama Sofi también) es arquitecta y le gusta ilustrar.</p>
<p>Gene, 35 años, trabaja con mujeres en salud reproductiva holistica hace 10 años.</p>
<p>Dani, 26 años, diseña productos de ciclismo urbano y le apasiona la fotografía.</p>
<p>Paty, 25 años, es geógrafa y le apasiona la enseñanza-aprendizaje.</p>
<p>Todas teníamos el sueño de viajar en bici dándonos vuelta en la cabeza, pero nos fuimos encontrando de a poco.</p>
<p>Primero Dany y Sofy conocieron a la Guaytamba gracias a un cicloviajero que ella hospedó en su casa. Luego Gene nos encontró en una feria y no lo dudó ni un segundo. Y finalmente Paty, se enteró del viaje y decidió subirse también.</p>
<p>Así, terminamos siendo 5 mujeres, consolidando un proyecto y haciéndolo realidad.</p>

</div><div> <h3>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</h3> <ul>
<li>Necesitamos suficiente comida y agua ( ya que serán nuestra gasolina durante el viaje) tambien es importante adquirir equipo de alta calidad y liviano por lo que aproximadamente nuestro presupuesto para 7  meses es de $18000.

<h3><strong>Historial de éxito</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Tres de nosotras hemos colaborado voluntariamente desde el 2010 en un colectivo de ciclistas mujeres de Quito, Ecuador, ""Carishina en Bici"". Hemos organizado carreras, talleres y la escuela de bici urbana ""Hadas Madrinas en Bici"", que han impactado a alrededor de 600 mujeres con resultados muy gratificantes.</p>

<p>Gene ha compartido con miles de mujeres temas de menstruación consciente a través de ""Lunas Ecológicas"", ahora lleva a cabo procesos de danzas de paz y círculos de mujeres.</p>

</div><div> <h3>Riesgos y desafíos</h3> <p> Somos conscientes que este viaje implica ciertos riesgos. Viajamos sin carro de abasto, con carpas, cocineta y cargando nuestro propio equipaje.  El respeto al ciclista en Sudamérica es escaso.  Puede ser que a la mitad del viaje no tengamos recursos económicos o nos roben. Además, muchas personas consideran que somos vulnerables por ser mujeres.  Finalmente, hay riesgos físicos como enfermedades, accidentes e inclemencias del clima.</p>
<ul>
<li>Una de las enseñanzas más importantes de la bici es la persistencia. Creemos que esa es una de nuestras mayores fortalezas y vemos a los riesgos como parte de los retos del viaje.</li>
<li>Al tratarse de un equipo multidisciplinario conocemos sobre mecánica de bicis, salud alimenticia, terapias alternativas, conocimiento de manejo de redes sociales y comunicación, idioma bilingue, que harán que podamos complementarnos en nuestras necesidades del día a día.</li>
<li>De todos modos, hemos planificado la ruta  día por día, para que los seguidores de nuestro proyecto sepan donde estamos.</li>

***
Warmifonias is a project involving five women: Sofy, Guaytamba, Gene, Dani and Paty (joined the project after the video recording). We all share the same dream: to travel by bicycle!
Sofy, 32 years old, is a city planner and works in education. She has been teaching other women how to ride the bicycle in the city for six years.

Guaytamba (actually her name is Sofi as well), 28 years old,  an architect who also loves to illustrate.

Gene, 35 years old, has worked with women in holistic reproductive health since 2006

Dani, 26 years old, designs urban cycling apparel and loves to take pictures.

Paty, 25 years old, is a geographer and loves teaching - learning processes.
Each of us dreamt of travelling by bike, and we met each other step by step in different situations.
Dani and Sofy met Guaytamba through a polish cyclo tourist that was staying at her home. From the very beginning they decided to do this trip and project together. Later on, Gene joined the project without doubting it a second. Finally, Paty knew about the project and decided to join us as well.
This is how we ended being 5 women turning this project into a reality!

As a sponsor, how are you helping to change the world?​

There are projects that are already changing our world. Your donations will make it possible to share these stories with you and many other people. Sharing this experiences is the key to making new transformations!We share our content at Warmifonias Blog, Warmifonias Facebook and other transmedia channels.
Your support in this project helps demystifying how women travel and live in South America. Also it helps promote cycling as a way of transportation.

What we need and what our sponsors will get in return?

We will need enough food and water (because this will be using our feet for transportation), having safe equipment and insurance. We plan on the 7 month trip to need aprox. $18,000 USD. Fortunately, we've saved for basic expenses already, but we still need your help to cover other expenses!
The money will be used mainly for buying food from local producers in each rural community we visit. 
After the trip, we will publish a digital book about our findings and we will do a photo exhibition of the story and illustrations of these inspiring women around South America.

 If we achieve our goal, 90% of the fundings will go to support the trip and 10% toward the digital release of research results.
If you support us, we want to reward you with special gifts : customized pictures, original illustrations, exclusive content of our trip, your name in our final digital and physical publications.
If we don't achieve our goal of $18,000, all collected funds will go towards  the trip’s basic expenses.
The impact 

Through us, the women we will be visiting will find a new channel to make their voices heard. Meanwhile, our visit and the final publication, are important ways to recognize  the value of what these women are doing for their communities.
In the other hand we want to share this network with you and many other people around the world, in that way, we can help many little ideas grow with inspiration and thank of this knowledge exchange!

 
Record of Success
Three of us are part of a volunteering woman-based group called ""Carishina en Bici"" since 2010. This group is based in Quito, Ecuador. We had planned street races, workshops and the amazing urban bicycle school called ""God Mother in bike"" that helps women of all ages to start riding bikes in the city. The impact with our action has created over 600 new women riders.

Gene has created a project that helps hundred of women a year called ""Lunas"" (translates to moons in English), a project promoting the use of ecological sanitary towels.

Risks and challenges 

We are knowledgable and aware of the risks that are included with travel. We will be traveling with no support car behing us, we will carry our tents, stoves and gear all by ourselves. There is limited education and respect for the cyclists in South America. Our biggest concern is that many people in South America see us as a very vulnerable just for the fact of being women. Finally, physic,health risks and bad climate are other risky factors we can't ignore, but will do our best to mitigate.
One of the principal focuses we have learned over the years with cycling is persistence. We believe that is one of our main strengths and we are also capable to see all the risks as challenges to overcome during this trip. We will overcome!
Our largest strength is to be multi-disciplinary. Together we cover knowledgement on many areas: bike mechanic, healthy nutrition, alternative therapies, comunication and social media skills, bilingual language. Our diverse backgrounds play well together in forming a unified team.

We have planned our route day by day, that way we can communicate our followers where we are and when we are going.
We have researched and purchased our equipment with professional advice. 
We have talked and travel with a lot of cycle tourists whom have completed similar routes. 
We will travel with an international insurance.
We are part of an international cyclist community network (warmshowers.org) that is a free worldwide hospitality exchange for touring cyclists. That way we will be covered in many cities we will visit.
We have already interviewed two women in our home city of Quito. Our project is already underway! 

Other ways you can help us:

Share this campaign! We want as many people as possible to be aware of this project.  
If you know projects in South America that involve badass women, send them to us. We would love to visit!
If you have friends living somewhere in our rute, please help us contacting them! So we can find good places to sleep or stay. :)

Warmifonias somos cinco amigas: Sofy, Guaytamba, Gene, Dani y Paty , quien se unió al proyecto después de la grabación del video. Todas con un mismo sueño, viajar en bicicleta!
Sofy, 32 años, es urbanista y trabaja en educación. Lleva 6 años enseñando a otras mujeres a pedalear en la ciudad.
Guaytamba, 28 años, (que en realidad se llama Sofi también) es arquitecta y le gusta ilustrar.
Gene, 35 años, trabaja con mujeres en salud reproductiva holistica hace 10 años.
Dani, 26 años, diseña productos de ciclismo urbano y le apasiona la fotografía.
Paty, 25 años, es geógrafa y le apasiona la enseñanza-aprendizaje.
Todas teníamos el sueño de viajar en bici dándonos vuelta en la cabeza, pero nos fuimos encontrando de a poco.
Primero Dany y Sofy conocieron a la Guaytamba gracias a un cicloviajero que ella hospedó en su casa. Luego Gene nos encontró en una feria y no lo dudó ni un segundo. Y finalmente Paty, se enteró del viaje y decidió subirse también.
Así, terminamos siendo 5 mujeres, consolidando un proyecto y haciéndolo realidad.

Con tu ayuda, ¿cómo ayudas a cambiar el mundo?​

Hay proyectos que están cambiando el mundo. Tu contribución hace posible que la historia de esos proyectos pueda llegar a ti y a muchas otras personas.  Su difusión es clave para generar nuevas transformaciones.Compartimos el contenido generado en Blog Warmifonias, Facebook Warmifonias y otros canales de transmedia.
Tu ayuda aporta a romper paradigmas en Sudamérica respecto a cómo viajamos las mujeres y el uso de la bici como medio de transporte.

 
 
 Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes 
Necesitamos suficiente comida y agua ( ya que serán nuestra gasolina durante el viaje) tambien es importante adquirir equipo de alta calidad y liviano por lo que aproximadamente nuestro presupuesto para 7  meses es de $18000. Afortunadamente hemos ahorrado y recaudado algunos fondos para ello, pero todavía necesitamos de tu ayuda!
El dinero recaudado se utilizará principalmente para comprar comida a productores locales de cada ciudad y pueblo que visitemos.
Luego de nuestro viaje publicaremos digitalmente un libro con todos los hallazgos e historias del viaje, también organizaremos una exposición con vídeos, ilustraciones, fotografías y escritos sobre estas inspiradoras mujeres sudamericanas a nuestro regreso a Ecuador. 

Si alcanzamos nuestra meta en esta campaña, el 90% de los fondos se destinarán para costear el viaje y el 10% restante irá para la publicación digital final.

Queremos recompensar a nuestros colaboradores! Con contenido especial y exclusivo : fotos personalizadas, videos especiales, ilustraciones, con la publicacion digital final.
Si no conseguimos recaudar el 100% del monto en esta campaña, los fondos iran para cubrir gastos del viaje para completarlo.

  El impacto 
Por una parte, las mujeres que vamos a visitar, a través de nosotras tienen un medio para hacer escuchar su voz. Al mismo tiempo, nuestra visita y la publicación son un reconocimiento de lo valioso que es su proyecto en sus comunidades.  
Por otro lado, queremos que esta red que llegará a ti y a varias personas alrededor del mundo, pueda generar un intercambio de saberes para enriquecer tus proyectos y potenciar los que tienes en mente.


 
Historial de éxito
 
Tres de nosotras hemos colaborado voluntariamente desde el 2010 en un colectivo de ciclistas mujeres de Quito, Ecuador, ""Carishina en Bici"". Hemos organizado carreras, talleres y la escuela de bici urbana ""Hadas Madrinas en Bici"", que han impactado a alrededor de 600 mujeres con resultados muy gratificantes.
http://carishinaenbici.blogspot.com/

Gene ha compartido con miles de mujeres temas de menstruación consciente a través de ""Lunas Ecológicas"", ahora lleva a cabo procesos de danzas de paz y círculos de mujeres.
http://lunasecologicas.org/ 
 Riesgos y desafíos  Somos conscientes que este viaje implica ciertos riesgos. Viajamos sin carro de abasto, con carpas, cocineta y cargando nuestro propio equipaje.  El respeto al ciclista en Sudamérica es escaso.  Puede ser que a la mitad del viaje no tengamos recursos económicos o nos roben. Además, muchas personas consideran que somos vulnerables por ser mujeres.  Finalmente, hay riesgos físicos como enfermedades, accidentes e inclemencias del clima.

Una de las enseñanzas más importantes de la bici es la persistencia. Creemos que esa es una de nuestras mayores fortalezas y vemos a los riesgos como parte de los retos del viaje.
Al tratarse de un equipo multidisciplinario conocemos sobre mecánica de bicis, salud alimenticia, terapias alternativas, conocimiento de manejo de redes sociales y comunicación, idioma bilingue, que harán que podamos complementarnos en nuestras necesidades del día a día.
De todos modos, hemos planificado la ruta  día por día, para que los seguidores de nuestro proyecto sepan donde estamos.
Hemos adquirido nuestro equipo con asesoramiento profesional.Nos hemos asesorado con muchos ciclo viajeros para evitar riesgos innecesarios.Contaremos con un seguro de salud internacional.
Formamos parte de una red internacional de ciclistas (warmshowers.org) que colaboran solidariamente con hospedaje y asesoramiento en varias ciudades que visitaremos.
Hoy por hoy, dentro de nuestra ciudad, ya estamos entrevistando a mujeres y compartiendo sus historias, el proyecto está en marcha.

The camp accommodates researchers, volunteers, student groups and expeditions in rustic comfort, with minimal impact to the surrounding forest ecosystem. ARCAmazon works with partner Amazon Centers throughout the Amazon rainforest.<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/amazonacademy?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=547944752019850"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">‪#‎AmazonAcademy‬</a><br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/conservetheamazon?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=547944752019850"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">‪#‎ConserveTheAmazon‬</a><br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/amazoncenter?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=547944752019850"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">‪#‎AmazonCenter‬</a></p><p>ARCAmazon is currently working to protect an important area within Madre de Dios called Las Piedras. Las Piedras is the longest tributary in the Madre de Dios Region and forms part of the Amazon-Andes Biodiversity Hotspot and an important area for its beautiful landscapes, rich fauna and flora, and fascinating native communities.</p><p>When our research teams began studying the Las Piedras River watershed they were blown away at the diversity and abundance of wildlife. Las Piedras is home to a number of remarkable communities, some indigenous to the region, some remote and unconnected with the outside world and others formed with the sole purpose of extracting the forest’s resources. The team was concerned to learn that this pristine area is under increasing pressure from the extraction of timber and the rapid conversion of forest into agriculture and pasture land. More so, that there is little to no private or government environmental policy enforcement in the area. For this reason, ARCAmazon has decided to pioneer a large conservation effort to begin dealing with the issues currently threatening Las Piedras.</p><p>The Fauna</p><p>While the area remains largely unstudied, we have already seen an extraordinarily large complement of wildlife species. The small area we have studied in the lower Las Piedras is home to over 40 medium to large-bodied mammals including cats: Jaguar, Ocelot, Margay, Puma and Jaguarundi; over 10 monkey species include Black spider monkey, Black-headed night monkey, Red howler monkey, Gray’s bald faced saki, and Saddle-backed tamarin; as well as many other enigmatic mammals such as the Short-eared dog, Giant armadillo, Giant anteater, Grison and Brazilian tapir. There is also an exciting assortment of over 500 bird species in the area, including some of the rarer species such as Psittacidae (Parrots), Cracidae (Guans), Harpia harpija (Harpy Eagle), Morphus guianensis (Crested Eagle), Conioptilon mcilhennyi (Black-faced Cotinga), Cnipodectes superrufus (Rufous Twistwing), Notharchus ordii (Brown-banded Puffbird), Conopias trivirgatus (Three-striped Flycatcher) and Sclerurus rufigularis (Short-billed Leaftosser)</p><p>The People</p><p>The headwaters of the Las Piedras begin in the Alto Purus National Park, home to groups of native indigenous tribes that live in voluntary isolation from the outside world. Our duty is to ensure we remain well away from these people for their safety, and ours, which is why we only work in the lower reaches of the Las Piedras River–days away from these important tribal lands. In the lower reaches of the Las Piedras River there are a number of interesting riverside communities that welcome visitors and the idea of responsible tourism. The communities of Lucerna and Palma Real form a river port and one of the oldest communities. They established during the time of the Rubber Barons.</p><p>There is a road between the community and the Interoceanic Highway which is beneficial to the Brazil nut harvesters who depend on good transport to maneuver their produce. The communities dedicate their lives to agriculture (corn, ginger, cacao, fruit), Brazil nut harvesting and timber. Further up river one finds the remote communities of Puerto Nuevo and Monte Salvado. Puerto Nuevo is an incredibly remote community, at two days upriver from Lucerna. This remoteness has advantages and disadvantages. While the community can lead a relatively undisturbed lifestyle and enjoy fluency in their native tongue (Yine) they are still at risk from disease, malnutrition, lack of access to health services and the odd surprise visit from the uncontacted tribes. Monte Salvado is the most remote settlement on the Las Piedras River and they are decedents of the Yine People. As implied by the name it is also the site of a North American Christian mission devoted to converting the uncontacted tribes to God. The strategy of the mission was to leave the tribes gifts of machetes and bananas. Not surprisingly, these days the community tends to be threatened by the uncontacted people at least once a year while the tribesmen gesture for more machetes and bananas.</p><p>The Challenge</p><p>Unfortunately, threats from the lower Las Piedras area are spreading upriver at a concerning rate and endangering the future of these unique people and wildlife. Between 2002 and 2004 the Peruvian government granted more than 7.5 million hectares of forest in concessions to logging companies. The middle and lower Las Piedras were primarily divided into Brazil Nut Concessions and Timber Concessions. Despite this attempt to zone the use of the forest, over-harvesting of timber continues to grow due to the high market price of species such as Mahogany, Cedar, and Iron Wood, and a total lack of government presence and law enforcement.</p><p>Recent loopholes in the law and generally low income from Brazil Nut harvesting has meant that thousands of Brazil Nut Concessions (hundreds of thousands of hectares) are now legally being logged, and hunted as a consequence, in the lower and mid Las Piedras. The areas surrounding Las Piedras are increasingly under threat from encroaching road networks and conversion of forests to agriculture. While it is technically illegal to convert forest in a concession many local people believe they will have a good chance of obtaining land ownership if they race to convert it to agriculture. As a result, the area cleared in the lower Las Piedras is growing at an alarming rate, with frontier extraction communities such as Lucerna continually felling and burning the land around them to make way for unsustainable agriculture. It is vital to work with these communities to find ways to increase the productivity of their forests and community lands, and so reduce their rate of forest conversion. There is currently little presence of private or government conservation-focused action in the region. ARCAmazon is one of the pioneers in this area and we are joining forces with other small initiatives to create a bigger impact.</p>Europe Trip<p></p><p>As a Lyft and Uber driver I hear from my riders ways to get the most out of my trip.  I will be working on farms and ranches, volunteering as tour guides and at hostels, and doing odd jobs to stretch my $800/mth budget as I work my way through every European Country and Looking at Africa and India and Asia as  well learning about various cultures, trying new challenges to sustainable living, and learning from various photographers. </p><p>I am looking at hoping to get a job with National Geographic or another company from my diverse portfolio when trip is said and done.</p></div>","https://instagram.com/ladykatphoenixhttps://flickr.com/hausphoenixrisingI was invited out to film and photograph the Amazon in Peru with the Conservation team Wild Forests and Fauna and ARCAmazon.

ARCAmazon works with partner Amazon Centers throughout the Amazon rainforest.‪#‎AmazonAcademy‬‪#‎ConserveTheAmazon‬‪#‎AmazonCenter‬ARCAmazon is currently working to protect an important area within Madre de Dios called Las Piedras. Las Piedras is the longest tributary in the Madre de Dios Region and forms part of the Amazon-Andes Biodiversity Hotspot and an important area for its beautiful landscapes, rich fauna and flora, and fascinating native communities.When our research teams began studying the Las Piedras River watershed they were blown away at the diversity and abundance of wildlife. Las Piedras is home to a number of remarkable communities, some indigenous to the region, some remote and unconnected with the outside world and others formed with the sole purpose of extracting the forest’s resources. The team was concerned to learn that this pristine area is under increasing pressure from the extraction of timber and the rapid conversion of forest into agriculture and pasture land. More so, that there is little to no private or government environmental policy enforcement in the area. For this reason, ARCAmazon has decided to pioneer a large conservation effort to begin dealing with the issues currently threatening Las Piedras.The FaunaWhile the area remains largely unstudied, we have already seen an extraordinarily large complement of wildlife species. The small area we have studied in the lower Las Piedras is home to over 40 medium to large-bodied mammals including cats: Jaguar, Ocelot, Margay, Puma and Jaguarundi; over 10 monkey species include Black spider monkey, Black-headed night monkey, Red howler monkey, Gray’s bald faced saki, and Saddle-backed tamarin; as well as many other enigmatic mammals such as the Short-eared dog, Giant armadillo, Giant anteater, Grison and Brazilian tapir. There is also an exciting assortment of over 500 bird species in the area, including some of the rarer species such as Psittacidae (Parrots), Cracidae (Guans), Harpia harpija (Harpy Eagle), Morphus guianensis (Crested Eagle), Conioptilon mcilhennyi (Black-faced Cotinga), Cnipodectes superrufus (Rufous Twistwing), Notharchus ordii (Brown-banded Puffbird), Conopias trivirgatus (Three-striped Flycatcher) and Sclerurus rufigularis (Short-billed Leaftosser)The PeopleThe headwaters of the Las Piedras begin in the Alto Purus National Park, home to groups of native indigenous tribes that live in voluntary isolation from the outside world. Our duty is to ensure we remain well away from these people for their safety, and ours, which is why we only work in the lower reaches of the Las Piedras River–days away from these important tribal lands. In the lower reaches of the Las Piedras River there are a number of interesting riverside communities that welcome visitors and the idea of responsible tourism. The communities of Lucerna and Palma Real form a river port and one of the oldest communities. They established during the time of the Rubber Barons.There is a road between the community and the Interoceanic Highway which is beneficial to the Brazil nut harvesters who depend on good transport to maneuver their produce. The communities dedicate their lives to agriculture (corn, ginger, cacao, fruit), Brazil nut harvesting and timber. Further up river one finds the remote communities of Puerto Nuevo and Monte Salvado. Puerto Nuevo is an incredibly remote community, at two days upriver from Lucerna. This remoteness has advantages and disadvantages. While the community can lead a relatively undisturbed lifestyle and enjoy fluency in their native tongue (Yine) they are still at risk from disease, malnutrition, lack of access to health services and the odd surprise visit from the uncontacted tribes. Monte Salvado is the most remote settlement on the Las Piedras River and they are decedents of the Yine People. As implied by the name it is also the site of a North American Christian mission devoted to converting the uncontacted tribes to God. The strategy of the mission was to leave the tribes gifts of machetes and bananas. Not surprisingly, these days the community tends to be threatened by the uncontacted people at least once a year while the tribesmen gesture for more machetes and bananas.The ChallengeUnfortunately, threats from the lower Las Piedras area are spreading upriver at a concerning rate and endangering the future of these unique people and wildlife. Between 2002 and 2004 the Peruvian government granted more than 7.5 million hectares of forest in concessions to logging companies. The middle and lower Las Piedras were primarily divided into Brazil Nut Concessions and Timber Concessions. Despite this attempt to zone the use of the forest, over-harvesting of timber continues to grow due to the high market price of species such as Mahogany, Cedar, and Iron Wood, and a total lack of government presence and law enforcement.Recent loopholes in the law and generally low income from Brazil Nut harvesting has meant that thousands of Brazil Nut Concessions (hundreds of thousands of hectares) are now legally being logged, and hunted as a consequence, in the lower and mid Las Piedras. The areas surrounding Las Piedras are increasingly under threat from encroaching road networks and conversion of forests to agriculture. While it is technically illegal to convert forest in a concession many local people believe they will have a good chance of obtaining land ownership if they race to convert it to agriculture. As a result, the area cleared in the lower Las Piedras is growing at an alarming rate, with frontier extraction communities such as Lucerna continually felling and burning the land around them to make way for unsustainable agriculture. It is vital to work with these communities to find ways to increase the productivity of their forests and community lands, and so reduce their rate of forest conversion. There is currently little presence of private or government conservation-focused action in the region. ARCAmazon is one of the pioneers in this area and we are joining forces with other small initiatives to create a bigger impact.Europe TripAs a Lyft and Uber driver I hear from my riders ways to get the most out of my trip.  I will be working on farms and ranches, volunteering as tour guides and at hostels, and doing odd jobs to stretch my $800/mth budget as I work my way through every European Country and Looking at Africa and India and Asia as  well learning about various cultures, trying new challenges to sustainable living, and learning from various photographers. I am looking at hoping to get a job with National Geographic or another company from my diverse portfolio when trip is said and done.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We have a small restaurant called Neenach Cafe near where the internationally famous Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) crosses Highway 138 at mile 518 in the desolate but picturesque West Antelope Valley in California.  In less than two years we have accumulated over 115 Google reviews (unsolicited) with an average rating of 4.5 stars. Google ""Neenach Cafe and Market"" (link here) to see them for yourself. We also have 29 Yelp reviews, also with an average rating of 4.5 stars (link here).  Much of that love came from PCT hikers, but we are only one lonely outpost along the 2665 mile (4290 km) long PCT.We would like to improve on that. What if we could serve hikers the kind of food they love (our food) all along the trail?  We could - with a food truck.  Nature imposes a strict timetable on PCT thru-hikers.  Approximately 6000 ambitious thru-hikers from around the world must depart from the Mexican Border mid Spring and hike at least fifteen miles per day to arrive at the Canadian Border by October 1st in order to avoid snow, raging torrents, and freezing temperatures as much as possible.This is the equivalent of climbing and descending Mount Everest nineteen times, or once every nine days.  Besides thru-hikers, it is estimated about a million people use the PCT each year for shorter adventures.  Our plan is to park our food truck at strategic locations along the PCT (road crossings, campgrounds, trailheads) and serve our popular cooking to hikers as they pass by according to their schedule.  After the main group of hikers have passed we'll move our food truck north to meet the bubble of hikers again.  We anticipate two to three weeks at each location, and we expect hikers will encounter us eight to twelve times during the course of their thru-hike.Hikers constantly communicate with each other via social media about trail conditions, equipment recommendations, and great places to eat (like ours), so our online presence among our aficionados is more like word-of-mouth than advertising.  Of course we will alert hikers on social media where they can find our food truck along the way.  They already eagerly anticipate feasting at the Neenach Cafe and they’re certain to enjoy our food truck even more.  And what’s not to love about finding a food truck in the middle of the wilderness, especially when you’re really hungry!  Best of all, for hikers it weighs nothing and takes up no space. We're World Famous! Feel the Love!Awesome people that really care about their customers and it shows in all their efforts. Great food. Good prices. Nice place with interesting insights to local history. - G.R.The food was extraordinary and the service superior.  I would recommend that when in the area stop in. - L.F.GR8 PLACE 2B, FRIENDLY STAFF AND VERY CLEAN WITH GR8 FOOD, I'LL B BAC.

<p> </p>
<p><u>OUR STORY... OUR JOURNEY</u></p>
<p>Hi! My name is Jericha Jordan and along with my husband Zac, we created RIGWA LIFE.  We live in Charleston, SC with our 4 amazing kids, living a fun, but super active lifestyle.  Whether it’s soccer practice, gymnastics, beach days, or a get-together with friends, we are often on-the-go!  When we’re not running all over town, we’re relaxing at home usually making home-cooked meals as a family. Whether we’re on-the-go or relaxing around the house, we’re always looking to enjoy fresh food... yet I’m ALWAYS searching for the perfect container to keep our FOOD FRESH!  A container to serve fruit at breakfast, but then store in the fridge for soccer practice later.  Or something to keep snacks fresh and cold at the beach... and durable enough for the kids to throw in their backpack.  Or maybe even something stylish enough to take to a party with friends and have our food fresh when we arrive!  I shuffle through plastic, glass, and metal containers - but never find one bowl that will do it all!  <strong>UNTIL NOW... </strong></p>
<p>It was on a random night making dinner at home when the RIGWA Bowl 1.5 was born.  It was taco night and I kept running back and forth to heat up the queso.  Frustrated, I looked at Zac and asked, “why haven’t we seen a vacuum insulated bowl - for food?”.   It was this question that sparked so many thoughts around all the uses we would have for a bowl like this.  Something versatile, functional, durable... and yes - still beautiful!  Ultimately, we couldn’t find anything out there... definitely nothing versatile enough for our family and active lifestyle!  So... <strong>We decided to GO FOR IT!!!</strong>  Take some risk... Create a product... <strong>and</strong> <strong>start our company, RIGWA LIFE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>We started this journey over two years ago</strong>, when we created our first concept drawings at home.  It was soon after those drawings that we became obsessed with creating a <i><strong>world class product that would forever change the way we view &amp; use a “bowl”!</strong></i>  We obsessed over every detail - whether it was the angles of the bowl, the materials used, or the lid design, every single element has been examined, tested, and redesigned to insure our customer’s satisfaction! </p>
<p>It is with incredible excitement, that we’re ready to launch the RIGWA Bowl 1.5 - YOUR MOST VERSATILE BOWL!  The container that will TRANSFORM FRESH FOOD ON-THE-GO!</p>
<p><u>PRODUCT</u></p>
<p><strong>**<i>THE</i> BOWL**</strong></p>
<p>We set out to create a bowl that would not only keep up with our active lifestyle, but enhance it.  The bowl itself holds <u><strong>1.5</strong></u> QTs (hence the name) and is high quality &amp; durable 18/8 food-grade stainless steel.  It is vacuum insulated, which allows you to <strong>keep food hot or cold for HOURS</strong>.  *<i><u>Up to</u> 4</i> hours hot &amp; <u><i>up to</i></u> 12 hours cold*.  The double walls prevent transfer of temperature... so fill it with HOT ramen or COLD ice cream and hold the bowl worry-free... and SWEAT-FREE!  The bowl offers a beautiful silhouette and has no visible weld seams or screw threads.  You won’t even see any visible logos (just a subtle one on the bottom).  Additionally, we designed the bowl itself with thoughtful angles and details.  We spent countless hours looking at the size of the bowl to increase versatility - large enough to share with others, while the perfect size for your own salad, soup, or açaí bowl.  This bowl is as stylish &amp; versatile as it is durable... and ready to take on ANY OCCASION.</p>
<p>*In a recent comparison test, the RIGWA Bowl (without lid) held ice for 13 hours before melting!!!  This was <strong>4-8 hours longer</strong> than the competitors in plastic, glass, and other metal bowls.  </p>
<p><i><strong>**THE GAME-CHANGER**</strong></i></p>
<p>Our LID is the main reason this product has taken two years from concept to launch, however it’s also the <u><i><strong>game-changer</strong></i></u><i><strong> </strong></i>for what will be your most versatile bowl.  The lid is BPA-free and insulated with a dynamic, yet simple design that increases the functionality, durability, and versatility of the bowl.  When you close the lid, you’ll hear the internal air release through the pressure cap, giving you the confidence your lid is secure and air-tight.  Once you close the pressure cap, you simply cannot remove the lid - well, most of us can’t... :).  When you’re ready to eat (or share), release the pressure cap and use the SIMPLE two-finger opening system to remove your lid with ease.  This dynamic feature (secure lock, yet easy to open) was not easily accomplished, but the code has been cracked!  Air-tight &amp; secure closure, yet easy to remove with 2-fingers... SIMPLE INNOVATION!</p>
<p>Together, the sleek and durable bowl meets an innovative and stylish lid to create YOUR MOST VERSATILE BOWL, ready for any adventure!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">OLD MAN’S: MORE THAN JUST ANOTHER SURF REPORT</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Old Man’s app was created for people who love and respect demanding outdoor marine sports. Using this app keeps the marine buoy guessing down and the marine sport activity up!</h3>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Built This Marine Forecasting App?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I wanted a <strong>forecasting app</strong> that had everything, Swell size, Wind, Tide, Everything in one sweet user friendly area - to quickly look and go to do my sports.</p></li>
<li><p> I wanted a design that was <strong>easy to read</strong> and felt like it was made for me and my active life.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted a forecast that fit my style, with <strong>unique functions and reliability</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p> I needed a forecasting app <strong>made for my life</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Now that it’s finally here, this is <strong>one app you or I will ever need</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY INDIEGOGO?</h3>
<p>PRE-ORDERS. The main purpose of this campaign is for promotional and pre-order activities. We are offering the project backers a unique opportunity to get our marine forecasting app at an incredibly attractive price <strong>‘FREE! for LIFE”</strong> (including all future updates) immediately during and at the end of the product campaign, before the app is put up for subscription. All pre-orders will also get a lifetime of new features and functions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Building a Better Forecasting App</h3>
<p>Together with my partner Boris, we developed a predictive algorithm (smart computer program) we call <strong>TWIGGE</strong>, or the “The Weather Information Global Gathering Environment.” This intelligent computer program forecasts and predicts surf at your local break.

<h3>Our Design and Feedback</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>In designing</strong> the Old Man’s Marine app, we considered the full range of feedback from marine app users requirements: what needed to be accessed quickly, what needed to be simply and accurately reviewed, and what needed to be quickly summarized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We attempted to strike</strong> a balance between the model of the phone size and operating system as well as the actual information on the smallest screen size without making information too difficult to see.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We used focus groups</strong> for their feedback. Most users needed certain requirements and services so we built that into our apps environment. We wanted to capture the needs of most user’s therefore helping them to engage more within the app.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We're thrilled with the result</strong>; Old Man’s app provided users a fast and accurate way to look up of marine forecasting information on our smallest supported iPhone, the apple iPhone 5. And an accurate friendly mobile screen, free from ads, encouraging forecast engagement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Just like wetsuit pioneer Jack O’Neill</strong>, Old Man’s app founders William P. Messier &amp; Boris Gundertlach wanted to create something that would allow people to do their water sports more wisely and focused on technology for inspiration. We wanted to push the limits of forecasting marine sports resulting in finding better days to Surf, SUP, Waveski and Foil because that is our ultimate love!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Old Man’s app was created</strong> for people who love and respect demanding outdoor marine sports. Using the app gets them to their location sooner, 7-day forecast and 7-day summary lets them plan out their week more efficiently, and TWIGGE, our expert algorithm allows them to do this with accurate information.</p></li>

<h3>More About Us</h3>
<p>I'm William P. Messier, the <strong>co-founder of Old Man’s</strong>.</p>
<p>For as long as I can remember I've had <strong>a taste for marine adventure</strong> and big challenges. I worked in the computer industry most of my life when programming was done on on computer punch cards and computers filled up rooms in order to operate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Surfing the early years,<strong> I developed a passion for forecasting</strong> marine sports and the only way to get a good forecast was to call life guards, read the newspaper, listen to the radio or step on the sand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>My dream</strong> was to create a mobile device that will help you understand marine weather and see forecasting trends 7 days out with just a motion of your hand. The technology was not available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>As the technology improved</strong> to what I felt was needed to initiate user defined designs, I vowed to finally pursue my dream and began working on the marine forecasting app of all apps.</p></li>
<li>My recent LinkedIn profile is available here ( check out some of the marine sport videos): </li>

<h3>Why You Can Trust We’ll Deliver Updates Regularly:</h3>
<p>All supporters, we are going to provide you this <strong>app for life!</strong>, which include future functions and features</p>
<p>We're going to <strong>keep on delivering</strong> you a better marine app. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, look at <strong>my passion</strong> for developing this marine forecasting app</p></li>
<li><p>The design of <strong>Old Man’s speaks to me</strong>, which means, I understand what users need and take my obligation to backers seriously.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, with a fully functional working app, and <strong>hundreds of happy backers</strong>, you can trust we are committed to delivering new versions and features as designed. Only better!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>This isn't a prototype</strong>. This is a fully functional working version! We will actually produce better future versions</p></li>
<li>
<strong>We have requests</strong> from existing users and will act on them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are <strong>a small company</strong> so it is easy to make decisions and turn our technology on a dime to change and move in that direction and to put that change into the next new version</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This insures the <strong>latest technology</strong> is infused into our marine app. </p></li>
<li><p>We take <strong>pride in personal service</strong> - it does not happen very often when users request help, but it is important for us to respond within an hour. We even provide a phone number. Who does that?</p></li>

<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>They are always there</strong>... but since we have a fully working functional program this risk is reduced. And no one within a crowdfunding campaign has ever said ""these risks could end us!"" Sorry, we are positive. We don't think the project is going to fail, for the reasons we outline below. But, there are a few important things you should know:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Life Happens</strong> - Life gets in the way and could slow down programming. As of today, we haven't detected it yet. We have made unbelievable strides overcoming huge obstacles with design and technology. We have a fully loaded functional working app with an unbelievable user interface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology Issues</strong> - We are always looking to incorporate the latest technology into mobile devices. Can the new devices handle this new technology? One thing we understand, innovation never stops and adapting newer technology to existing mobile devices is a matter of working out the kinks on our end.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Getting Your Phone Model To Work</strong> - This is a risk. We design everything according to Apples’s recommendations. An iOS developer generally needs to have their apps work with the most recent models of iPhones. Developers need to support the most recent and last major release of iOS. The rule of thumb is that phones have a three-year life. With that in mind, “Old Man’s” will support IOS devices as low as iPhone 5.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Updating The App</strong> - To get the latest update with the latest cool features make sure your iPhone model is set to automatically updated by default. The iPhone 5 and above will allow you to do this in your settings. We are producing updates regularly with super cool features and function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You Don't Like the App</strong> - There isn't a lot we can do about this one. But really, the app is awesome. We don’t know anyone who hasn’t loved it yet!</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Those are the risks</strong> as we see them.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Old Man’s app was created for people who love and respect demanding outdoor marine sports. Using this app keeps the marine buoy guessing down and the marine sport activity up!
 

Why We Built This Marine Forecasting App?

I wanted a forecasting app that had everything, Swell size, Wind, Tide, Everything in one sweet user friendly area - to quickly look and go to do my sports.
 I wanted a design that was easy to read and felt like it was made for me and my active life.
I wanted a forecast that fit my style, with unique functions and reliability.
 I needed a forecasting app made for my life.
Now that it’s finally here, this is one app you or I will ever need

 
WHY INDIEGOGO?
PRE-ORDERS. The main purpose of this campaign is for promotional and pre-order activities. We are offering the project backers a unique opportunity to get our marine forecasting app at an incredibly attractive price ‘FREE! for LIFE” (including all future updates) immediately during and at the end of the product campaign, before the app is put up for subscription. All pre-orders will also get a lifetime of new features and functions.
 
Building a Better Forecasting App
Together with my partner Boris, we developed a predictive algorithm (smart computer program) we call TWIGGE, or the “The Weather Information Global Gathering Environment.” This intelligent computer program forecasts and predicts surf at your local break. TWIGGE is very accurate, forecasting swells thousands of miles away then predicting those same swells at the local surf spot.

Boris and I spent months just designing and working on the user interface or how the screen works with the user. We researched our customers - found out what they liked and designed our surf forecasting app around that focus.
We have Exceptional Current Resources - we use over 7 global weather data resources and work personally with them to suggest what we need, and they in turn research their data driven computer models to improve spatial resolution (or precision of a measurement on the current weather model or weather map) for us.

Our Innovation Never Stops - We are in contact with “Big Wave Riders” who are testing our long range models helping us improve our developed forecasts. 

 

Our Funding Needs and What You Will Receive
Your contributions will go towards funding the marketing of our fully functional app called the ""Old Man’s Surf Report"" (Old Man’s) for IOS mobile devices.

The Old Man IOS app is already fully functional including several features and functionalities like favorite marine breaks and secret spots.
We are asking for $6,500. With your help we will use the money to alert people who are unhappy with the existing big swell forecasting companies, and that they have a better choice.
Our funding goal of $6,500 is our budget to accomplish the marketing of our app, targeting surfer oriented print and social media products.
The Android version, we would love to include as our stretch-goals, with extra funding, development for the Android mobile operating system will be accomplished.
Old Man’s unique intelligent programming is focused on how the swell breaks at the local level, it’s bathymetry (or measurement of the depth of the water), how the tide, swell height, swell period, wind, and the local coastline locations affect your local break. 
For the past few months the Old Man’s app was tested by hundreds of people. It has received rave reviews by testimonies and all 5 star reviews from the Apple Store

July 2019: officially released app on the Apple Store for world wide prototype feedback - We received personal positive feedback and Great! 5 star reviews.
August 2019: Continued working on interface features and polishing from world wide focus groups feedback
September 2019: Full working app - testing, quality control and refined from focus groups feedback. We received rave reviews
September 2019 - 2020: Adding new features and functions and refinement from user feedback
January 2020: We launch our Indiegoggo campaign
February 2020: We develop a complete working Apple watch version
April 2020: We will develop a complete working version for the Android mobile operating system and Metic System on the Android.

Why Crowdfunding  on INDIEGOGO?

PRE-ORDERS. The main purpose of this campaign is for promotional and pre-order activities. We are offering the project backers a unique opportunity to get our marine forecasting app at an incredibly attractive price ‘FREE! for LIFE” immediately during and at the end of the product campaign, before the app is put up for subscription. All pre-orders will also get a lifetime of new features and functions.
OUR GOALS - Your contributions will go towards funding the marketing of our existing fully functional app called the Old Man’s Surf Report (Old Man’s) for IOS mobile devices. 
With your help we will use the money to alert people who are unhappy with the existing big marine forecasting companies, and that they have a better choice
Our funding goal of $6,500 is our budget to accomplish the marketing of our app, targeting marine oriented print and social media products. 

GETTING THE WORD OUT. Indiegogo is a great way of facing and supporting our patrons.

Old Man’s have surveyed hundreds of user groups to find out what they liked within a working marine forecasting app.
Then we designed it around that focus - creating the highest performing product we can, but we can always improve.
We need more feedback from marine forecasters from all over the world to help us improve and make the greatest marine forecasting app in the world.
And you can help us accomplish this either by becoming a backer or giving feedback on our Instagram Page:

Why You Can Trust We’ll Deliver Updates Regularly:
All supporters, we are going to provide you this app for life!, which include future functions and features
We're going to keep on delivering you a better marine app. Here's why:

First, look at my passion for developing this marine forecasting app
The design of Old Man’s speaks to me, which means, I understand what users need and take my obligation to backers seriously.
Second, with a fully functional working app, and hundreds of happy backers, you can trust we are committed to delivering new versions and features as designed. Only better!
This isn't a prototype. This is a fully functional working version! We will actually produce better future versions

We have requests from existing users and will act on them.

We are a small company so it is easy to make decisions and turn our technology on a dime to change and move in that direction and to put that change into the next new version

This insures the latest technology is infused into our marine app. 
We take pride in personal service - it does not happen very often when users request help, but it is important for us to respond within an hour. We even provide a phone number. Who does that?

We have user defined designs by surfers for surfers. We researched our users, find out what they liked and designed a marine forecasting app around that focus and continue to do so

When you back us, you can trust this project will come to life. Don't hesitate to send us a message if you have any questions or concerns.
All we need is your support...
 
The Tech Guy Interviews Old Man's

 
Risks & Challenges
They are always there... but since we have a fully working functional program this risk is reduced. And no one within a crowdfunding campaign has ever said ""these risks could end us!"" Sorry, we are positive. We don't think the project is going to fail, for the reasons we outline below. But, there are a few important things you should know:

Life Happens - Life gets in the way and could slow down programming. As of today, we haven't detected it yet. We have made unbelievable strides overcoming huge obstacles with design and technology. We have a fully loaded functional working app with an unbelievable user interface.
Technology Issues - We are always looking to incorporate the latest technology into mobile devices. Can the new devices handle this new technology? One thing we understand, innovation never stops and adapting newer technology to existing mobile devices is a matter of working out the kinks on our end.
Getting Your Phone Model To Work - This is a risk. We design everything according to Apples’s recommendations. An iOS developer generally needs to have their apps work with the most recent models of iPhones. Developers need to support the most recent and last major release of iOS. The rule of thumb is that phones have a three-year life. With that in mind, “Old Man’s” will support IOS devices as low as iPhone 5.
Updating The App - To get the latest update with the latest cool features make sure your iPhone model is set to automatically updated by default. The iPhone 5 and above will allow you to do this in your settings. We are producing updates regularly with super cool features and function.
You Don't Like the App - There isn't a lot we can do about this one. But really, the app is awesome. We don’t know anyone who hasn’t loved it yet!

Those are the risks as we see them.
 

Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>Taskin Xpress: Say Goodbye to The Ordinary </h3>
<p>Here's a little backstory on this new product: When our Taskin Kruze toiletry bag campaign became an instant success, we started receiving requests for a smaller, more compact companion to this breakthrough bag. One with many of the same things everybody loves about Kruze—but suited for shorter trips and carry-on only travels.</p>
<p>So, by popular demand, we're amped to introduce the Taskin Xpress.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528157038/q6ntev9yadmoehko0tzg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Just look at the stand-out features you get with Taskin Xpress:</p>
<p>As with all our other products, our primary focus is always to bring you outstanding and innovative travel gear. The same is true for Xpress, which comes complete with:</p>
<p><strong>Kruze-style Suctioning</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2114/9475/files/Kruze_SuctionCups.gif?13476527715718702615"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Four powerful suction cups allow you to attach Xpress to any smooth surface—the bathroom mirror, the tile next to the shower, you name it. Now, everything you need is always within easy reach. And once you see how hanging your bag away from the counter helps keep your stuff stay clean and dry? Let's just say you won't be the first Taskin backer to fight back tears of joy.</p>
<p>With four 3 cms sized suction cups the Xpress will stay up for weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Detachable, TSA-Friendly Toiletry Pouch</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2114/9475/files/TASPouch.gif?1997226615817263141"" src=""""/></p>

<p>An easily detachable, TSA-compliant waterproof pouch can be affixed to Xpress—even with the zipper up—for fast, convenient security screening. Everybody else's toiletry bags have some explaining to do.</p>
<p><strong>High-Density Packing</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2114/9475/files/StopMotionV264.gif?1997226615817263141"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In-spite of its compact size, the Xpress can fit far more than you would expect. The multiple pockets also allows you to better organize your stuff and easily access them when needed. Usability has never been so useful.</p>
<p><strong>Expandable Construction for 30% More Space</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528160311/vhykjd2worqfirhevbti.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>High-quality construction means you can expand the inside volume up to 30%. Which means you can pack more when you need to—and save space when you don't. Plus, the elasticity of our premium materials keeps all your toiletries in place. And hallelujah for that.</p>
<p><strong>Metallic Inner Lining</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528155428/fwmzio32dtbiu6dmirtf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Xpress comes lined with an advanced, polyester coating with a layer of aluminum to improve visibility and to help keep the inside dry and microbe-free. Plus it just looks cool.</p>
<p><strong>Tough, Waterproof Materials</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528155491/lrasucd5jpjui56hhnq0.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The exterior is premium, waterproof tarpaulin. The inside mesh is PVC. And the inner lining is metalized polyester. Which means Xpress is highly water- and mess-resistant. And you can really use that. Just saying.</p>
<p><strong>The Perfect Gift</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528171929/adhndv9tgnfdvhbgpgna.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>EU friendly shipping</h3>
<p>Rewards for our EU backers will ship from UK and we will take care of VAT and customs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While we expect this campaign to run like clockwork, there are always a few risks involved, such as the possibility that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We run into production issues—like NASA buying up the global supply of metalized polyester</li>
<li>Customs holds our shipments for a few weeks until we get a chance to pay the ransom</li>
<li>Our kids make a giant squishy-ball with all our shipping labels (looking at you, Alex)</li>
</ul>
<p>We've done our best to mitigate these risks by working with a high-end manufacturer that produces gear for major brands. We're using well-established shipping companies that know the ins-and-outs of customs. And yes, we're hiding all the shipping labels from Alex.</p>
<p>If challenges do occur, rest assured we'll do our utmost to minimize any delays and to ship your toiletry bag by the estimated time—or you get your money back.</p>
<p>Hey, we didn't call it Xpress for nothing.</p>

And once you see how hanging your bag away from the counter helps keep your stuff stay clean and dry? Let's just say you won't be the first Taskin backer to fight back tears of joy.
With four 3 cms sized suction cups the Xpress will stay up for weeks.
Detachable, TSA-Friendly Toiletry Pouch


An easily detachable, TSA-compliant waterproof pouch can be affixed to Xpress—even with the zipper up—for fast, convenient security screening. Everybody else's toiletry bags have some explaining to do.
High-Density Packing

In-spite of its compact size, the Xpress can fit far more than you would expect. The multiple pockets also allows you to better organize your stuff and easily access them when needed. Usability has never been so useful.
Expandable Construction for 30% More Space

High-quality construction means you can expand the inside volume up to 30%. Which means you can pack more when you need to—and save space when you don't. Plus, the elasticity of our premium materials keeps all your toiletries in place. And hallelujah for that.
Metallic Inner Lining

Xpress comes lined with an advanced, polyester coating with a layer of aluminum to improve visibility and to help keep the inside dry and microbe-free. Plus it just looks cool.
Tough, Waterproof Materials

The exterior is premium, waterproof tarpaulin. The inside mesh is PVC. And the inner lining is metalized polyester. Which means Xpress is highly water- and mess-resistant. And you can really use that. Just saying.
The Perfect Gift

Xpress come beautifully packaged and would be the perfect gift for the traveler in your life.

Rewards

Guaranteed on time shipping
We guarantee your Taskin Xpress will ship from our factory on or before the estimated date—or you can get a full refund. The estimated date provided is the date we ship from the factory, the date you receive your reward will vary depending on your shipping country.
EU friendly shipping
Rewards for our EU backers will ship from UK and we will take care of VAT and customs.

Risks & Challenges
While we expect this campaign to run like clockwork, there are always a few risks involved, such as the possibility that:

We run into production issues—like NASA buying up the global supply of metalized polyester
Customs holds our shipments for a few weeks until we get a chance to pay the ransom
Our kids make a giant squishy-ball with all our shipping labels (looking at you, Alex)

We've done our best to mitigate these risks by working with a high-end manufacturer that produces gear for major brands. We're using well-established shipping companies that know the ins-and-outs of customs. And yes, we're hiding all the shipping labels from Alex.
If challenges do occur, rest assured we'll do our utmost to minimize any delays and to ship your toiletry bag by the estimated time—or you get your money back.
Hey, we didn't call it Xpress for nothing.",16.0,1,"11 Campaigns

<h3>Why are we Building a new Gymnasium in Zimbabwe and Why you should be a part of It </h3>
<p></p>
<p>I have seen the affect gymnastics has had on the young
individuals of Zimbabwe and how it has enabled them to change the direction of
their lives no matter what back ground they are coming from or what is going on
in our country at that time. Over the years I have been on a journey with many
of the youths of Harare and it is incredible to be able to witness and support
a young boy or girl rise from one of Harare’s many high density housing areas,
and defy all the odds stacked against them. For them to then go on to become
both a national champion and a nationals icon of hope and strength as they
represent their nation.</p>
<p>This is why we are building a new centre, to be able to keep
training these gymnasts and nurturing their dreams of success and greatness.</p>

<br/><p>Through gymnastics we have seen children turn around their lives at school, teenagers stay off the streets and go onto college and university and individuals go on to be the bread winners of their families.</p>
<p>So we are more then just asking you to be part of building a building, we are offering you the unique opportunity to be part of these young individuals growth and reform, to be part of keeping the sport of gymnastics alive in Zimbabwe AND to have your name forever embossed on the building for all future generations of gymnasts to see as they arrive and leave the gymnasium each day.</p>

Like many, they decided to stay and help where they could. During the weeks that followed, they found themselves delivering aid to those that had received nothing. Despite assisting numerous families in the days and weeks following the disaster, they had a desire to create something longer lasting; a project that would continue to raise funds for those in need.'Nepal 425' is their project...'Nepal 425' is a project started by 4 people; but has quickly become a project created by hundreds. Help us make this a project created by thousands.
          By Supporting this campaign 'Nepal 425' becomes YOUR project...
Since May 2015 we have collated nearly 700 images from professional and amateur photographers of all nationalities. The best of these images will become the Nepal 425 Photo Book. It will create a work of cultural and topical relevance that will be showcased worldwide through the book and associated exhibitions. 
All proceeds from the book will go to help projects in Nepal through our local partner charity VolNepal.



""VolNepal is currently focusing on rebuilding schools which have been affected by the earthquake. As our mission is to build sustainable communities, we believe that targeting schools of earthquake affected areas is a step towards that goal. We believe it is very important for children to remain active and their minds to be constantly engaged. Thus, we are targeting schools in order to provide children the opportunity to rebuild, mingle with and learn from their peers and teachers, and above all, put the trauma of the earthquake behind and move forward in their lives.""



Our Funding Goals:
We have started from small beginnings; but our ambitions are mountainous, and for good reason. We have been shown the true generosity of the people of Nepal; now its time for us to give back. 
Our primary goal is to print and sell 1,000 copies of the Nepal 425 photo book with all profits going to VolNepal. With further funding we will be able to print more books and in turn raise more money for VolNepal. 
We would love the opportunity not only to display these wonderful images as part of a book, but also to hold exhibitions around the world. These exhibitions would help to showcase the images in the book and further raise awareness and fundraising for Nepal. Additional contributions would allow us to cover the costs of holding exhitbitions About the Nepal 425 photo book:While there was massive loss of life and much devastation; Nepal 425 will show more than this. It will show the resilience and strength of the Nepali people, for which they are so well know. It will show the aid and relief the country has received and the people standing up and rebuilding their homes and their country together. 

Nepal remains one of the world's most beautiful countries, the quake hasn't changed that. Nepal 425 will help to encourage visitors back again. Tourism will provide much needed investment to help the country get back onto their feet.

Our central location will enable us to help commuters, downtown residents and those riding the nearby bike trails. We'll provide the community with information on cycling awareness and year round cycling sustainment and activities.</span><br/>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">       I think bikes are the ultimate form of transportation. I love working on bikes, there's always something new to learn or problem solve. I have collected an assortment of experience over the past decade and a half; working in shops, fixing friend's bikes, and friends of friend's bikes. I've been an avid bike commuter for nearly 20 years, and I have over 15 years experience as a courier. I've negotiated traffic and fixed flats in hailstorms, and I've spent many hours on the trails. Now it's time for the next bike chapter in my life, owning my own bike shop.</span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">       The location of the shop is 124 E. Long Street, once home to B1 Bicycles. They closed their doors in October of 2015 after 8 years of operation. Losing the convenience of it's central location and proximity to nearby trails, it was a great loss to many Columbus cyclists and commuters. Opening a shop in that location is an opportunity  to continue to provide a service to the community, and create a inclusive environment for all cyclists.</span>

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">       Reaching a $10, 000 goal will allow us to purchase shop tools, basic inventory and necessary fixtures, and a POS system. Roughly 1/3 of the funds will be used for an initial batch of tools, the pinnacle of our trade. $2000 will be used to stock the shelves the basics like helmets, tubes, tires, lights, and fenders. Let's not forget repair shop necessities like cables, housing, grease, screws, spacers, bearings, industry level repair manuals, and so forth. We plan to have a core of used bikes on the floor tuned up in-house, and $1500 will go toward purchasing up to 30 bikes of all varieties. The remaining funds will be used to purchase a POS system and shop fixtures.</span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">       Our Perks are services and discounts that range from $5 to $1000. Services such as tube/tire installation and tune ups are offered. Upper level perks offer store credit with bonus savings. Swag! We are going to print up stickers, fliers, and T-shirts to help spread the word about the shop. </span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span></div><div><br/></div><div>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">       $10, 000 is only 25% of the average startup funds needed to start a small business, and will get us past the initial hump. Using an accumulated sense of efficiency and frugality, I will keep purchases basic and necessary, the flair will be in the excitement in seeing more bikes on the road! </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> Even if you d</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">on't have biking needs you can still help out.

Our central location will enable us to help commuters, downtown residents and those riding the nearby bike trails. We'll provide the community with information on cycling awareness and year round cycling sustainment and activities.

Bike Passion
       I think bikes are the ultimate form of transportation. I love working on bikes, there's always something new to learn or problem solve. I have collected an assortment of experience over the past decade and a half; working in shops, fixing friend's bikes, and friends of friend's bikes. I've been an avid bike commuter for nearly 20 years, and I have over 15 years experience as a courier. I've negotiated traffic and fixed flats in hailstorms, and I've spent many hours on the trails. Now it's time for the next bike chapter in my life, owning my own bike shop.

       The location of the shop is 124 E. Long Street, once home to B1 Bicycles. They closed their doors in October of 2015 after 8 years of operation. Losing the convenience of it's central location and proximity to nearby trails, it was a great loss to many Columbus cyclists and commuters. Opening a shop in that location is an opportunity  to continue to provide a service to the community, and create a inclusive environment for all cyclists.

Funding Breakdown


       Reaching a $10, 000 goal will allow us to purchase shop tools, basic inventory and necessary fixtures, and a POS system. Roughly 1/3 of the funds will be used for an initial batch of tools, the pinnacle of our trade. $2000 will be used to stock the shelves the basics like helmets, tubes, tires, lights, and fenders. Let's not forget repair shop necessities like cables, housing, grease, screws, spacers, bearings, industry level repair manuals, and so forth. We plan to have a core of used bikes on the floor tuned up in-house, and $1500 will go toward purchasing up to 30 bikes of all varieties. The remaining funds will be used to purchase a POS system and shop fixtures.
       Our Perks are services and discounts that range from $5 to $1000. Services such as tube/tire installation and tune ups are offered. Upper level perks offer store credit with bonus savings. Swag! We are going to print up stickers, fliers, and T-shirts to help spread the word about the shop.  
Risks, Challenges, And Other Ways You Can Help
   
       $10, 000 is only 25% of the average startup funds needed to start a small business, and will get us past the initial hump. Using an accumulated sense of efficiency and frugality, I will keep purchases basic and necessary, the flair will be in the excitement in seeing more bikes on the road!  Even if you don't have biking needs you can still help out. Perks can be transferred to friends and relatives, or given as a gift. Or simply help get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word just in time for the season!

<h2>New Development: Gibbon is excited to announce faster turnaround times for backers!</h2>
<p>Worried that you won't get your carrier in time for your Summer family getaway? We've got you covered! Our initial production schedule put us at a September 2016 delivery.

All the carriers we tried were bulky, difficult to use, or they made us too physically hot and sweaty.  We decided to dedicate all of our time and energy to developing the ultimate next-generation child carrier. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We wanted the smallest, most lightweight and easy to use carrier to <b>solve this problem once and for all.</b></span></p><p></p>
<h2>Materials, features &amp; use</h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Gibbon Carrier is the first high-quality, ultra-smart, and ultra-light compact carrier built for children 2-5 years old that’s quick to deploy, comfortable, and easy to use. With a Gibbon Carrier, you can venture off the beaten path and enjoy long hikes and picnics in hard-to-reach places without the burden.</span></p>
<h4>Compact and easy to deploy </h4>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Gibbon Child Carrier easily and carefully folds up into a small drawstring bag with a carabiner that can be then be clipped onto your belt loop or put into your day bag.

When stressful situations arise, the last thing you want to be burdened with the task of deploying a carrier. We wanted to make the Gibbon Carrier as easy to use and intuitive as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Once a child steps into the carrier, he or she can then be carried piggy-back style while all the while keeping the parent’s hands free for other tasks, such as shopping for groceries, ordering lunch at a cafe, or handling luggage. When you're all done, you simply just fold it back up into itself and clip it onto your belt loop or toss it into your day bag.</span></p>

<h2>Our Journey</h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">When my wife and I had our son, Magnus, we wanted do all of the things we love to do, but we wanted him to be able to enjoy them, too.

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">By time he was about two years old, he was starting to get bigger and heavier which made traveling with him more difficult. We were carrying him a lot, which was uncomfortable and tiring for everyone. We tried to solve it by purchasing several different makes and models of strollers and child carriers, but we quickly noticed that a lot of the solutions out there weren’t working for us and were cutting into the time we were supposed to be enjoying together.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Strollers, car seats and bulky backpacks can be difficult to travel with and take up a lot of space in vehicles, overhead compartments and in crowded trains, trams and buses.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">In some instances, just having a stroller can have a negative impact on your travel plans. One time when boarding a plane to Paris, we were asked to pay an additional $5 just to check our stroller. Running through the airport with our infant son asleep in a stroller in addition to our check baggage was already taking it’s toll, and suddenly we were hit with this extra inconvenience.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">On the ground in Paris, the stroller struggle continued. Many of the streets are cobblestone and are difficult to navigate with a stroller. On several occasions, our son nearly fell out from all the vibration.

She had taken our son along with her but he had become exhausted and inconsolable. She was so tired of having carried him around that she was almost in tears as she spoke to me. They had boarded the train a while ago and she decided to ride it around for nearly an hour to let him sleep and so that she didn’t have to carry him.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We were getting fed up.

</div></div>","New Development: Gibbon is excited to announce faster turnaround times for backers!
Worried that you won't get your carrier in time for your Summer family getaway? We've got you covered! Our initial production schedule put us at a September 2016 delivery. However, we're listening when you say you don't want to wait until this fall. We've been exploring some advanced production techniques, such as digitized patterns, that will enable us to deliver our carriers to backers by July 2016!

Hi, I’m Christian Brodin, Founder of the Gibbon Child Carriers! After two years of working our butts off, we’ve harnessed the best of technology and design to provide an amazing solution to problems that parents experience getting their kids from points A to B.
Without further adieu, we present the fruits of our labor and invite you to join us on our journey to make the Gibbon Child Carrier the ultimate carrier for parents on the move with small children!



As parents, we want to share all of our adventures with our children. However, moving around with them can be a challenge as they get older and heavier. When they become tired or hungry, a family outing can fall apart quickly.
Little voices saying ""Mom, Dad, I'm tired! Can you carry me?"" can be a certain death rattle for a pleasant family outing. Not to mention, juggling shopping bags, car seats, suitcases and backpacks can be incredibly tiring and add stress to even the most simple family adventures.

We’re excited to tell you that being out with your children doesn’t have to be a burden! Whether it’s a daily train commute, picking them up from preschool, a trip to the museum or exploring of the streets of Paris, the Gibbon Carrier is the solution that parents traveling with young children have been asking for! 

This campaign is very important to us because only a couple of years ago while traveling with our son and trying other carriers, we saw a need for innovation. All the carriers we tried were bulky, difficult to use, or they made us too physically hot and sweaty.  We decided to dedicate all of our time and energy to developing the ultimate next-generation child carrier. 
We wanted the smallest, most lightweight and easy to use carrier to solve this problem once and for all.
Materials, features & use
The Gibbon Carrier is the first high-quality, ultra-smart, and ultra-light compact carrier built for children 2-5 years old that’s quick to deploy, comfortable, and easy to use. With a Gibbon Carrier, you can venture off the beaten path and enjoy long hikes and picnics in hard-to-reach places without the burden.
Compact and easy to deploy 
The Gibbon Child Carrier easily and carefully folds up into a small drawstring bag with a carabiner that can be then be clipped onto your belt loop or put into your day bag. When you need it, you simply unfold it and it’s ready to use!



As a parent, your mind is constantly occupied making sure your child is cared for and safe. When stressful situations arise, the last thing you want to be burdened with the task of deploying a carrier. We wanted to make the Gibbon Carrier as easy to use and intuitive as possible.
Once a child steps into the carrier, he or she can then be carried piggy-back style while all the while keeping the parent’s hands free for other tasks, such as shopping for groceries, ordering lunch at a cafe, or handling luggage. When you're all done, you simply just fold it back up into itself and clip it onto your belt loop or toss it into your day bag.




Build Quality


We wanted to make a carrier that was smooth and well designed but also sturdy. Quality is extremely important to us, and we value products that are not only pleasing to use, but also last for a life time!

Inspired by popular adventure gear from quality brands such as Patagonia and Arcteryx, we work with materials that are not only tough but also come in colors and patterns that are appealing to both children and adults. All our carriers are made by hand in the US. Every seam and stitch is made with quality and strength in mind. Because of our extreme attention to detail, the carrier is built to last so you can use it for years to come as your child grows.


Designed in Oslo Norway and hand-assembled in Portland, Oregon, it has been tested with parents and children across the globe. 


Reviews & field research

We asked parents to try out our carrier to see what they thought. The parents who participated were both men and women between 25-40 years old and ranging in height and weight from small 5'4"" and 115lbs to 5'8"" and  180lbs.
All children tested were between the ages of 3 and 5 and weighed around 37lbs. Here's  a sampling of the reactions we heard!
Portability





""I liked how small it was. Very easy to carry around and can easily stick in my purse.""

Size, comfort and design

""I was surprised how well my child's weight was distributed on my back ... I've used all sorts of baby/child carriers and they seem to hurt my back and shoulders quickly.""
Use
""I could see the Gibbon Carrier being great in a lot of situations, especially for early toddlers.""
""I would bring it if I know we'll need to be out during nap time.""
""Definitely excited that this will be on the market for parents!""

We also got some amazing feedback and ideas on how to further our designs for additional comfort, design and ease of use. With contributions from this campaign, we can really get to work and use the information we gathered to perfect the design very quickly and effectively. Here's the breakdown.






We’ve turned to IndieGoGo to open our idea to an awesome community of other savvy parents from across the globe. We want to learn from you, and with your support, we can make a truly revolutionary child carrier that can improve the lives of parents everywhere.
The Gibbon Child Carrier is almost ready for mass production, but only your help will get us there! We have expertise in developing new products and ideas, and we have partnered with experienced manufacturers and designers to make them a reality. All together, we can make this happen!
All contributions from this campaign will be spent on product development, testing, certification, production and marketing, and building a full line of products. Our aim is to sell the Gibbon Child Carrier all over the world. By ensuring we meet the strictest guidelines for quality and safety, we have an opportunity to do this.
Throughout the campaign, we’ll be pushing for some stretch goals.




When you back this campaign, you’re helping build a foundation on which we can build a company that can do more to benefit the world. The Gibbon Child Carrier is only the beginning. Now that we have the expertise, the access to top-notch materials and construction methods, we can begin to explore other industries that can benefit from the technology. When you fund us, you're not just making life easier for parents. You're part of an impact that will be felt in other markets.


You can also support us by helping us spread the work on Facebook and Twitter. Please make good use of the social sharing buttons on this campaign. We’ll love you for it!

April: Complete testing and international quality control certifications, including certification to sell to children.
May/June: Pilot production, quality assurance and product validation.
July: Begin order fulfillment!


When we first began designing the carrier, we realized that it was quickly starting to resemble a gibbon monkey, swinging through the trees. It is also a reference to how gibbons carry their young. They are in a perpetual embrace. 

This is also telling of our long term mission, which is to bring families closer together by allowing them to focus on all of life's precious moments and less on the woes of child mobility.

<h4>Broadcast personal messages to earthlings</h4>
<p>Some perks include a text and audio message to all earthlings, which will be broadcast during rover operation.

<h4>Give many people physical access to the robot</h4>
<p>You can make an application for a landing area as a single person, but what about inviting some people to assist you in making the landing area more exciting? Through an infrared interface, the rover can interact with objects close to it. You will get instructions in how to connect the rover to your network infrastructure and how to establish communication between remote modules. Prepare your area several days before the rover goes live. In this period you can teach many people how the robot works or simply give them a hand on the tiny explorer.<br/></p>
<h4>After your mission is before the next mission - get connected.</h4>
<p>The world tour will be a relay race. The group that sent the robot to you will get an extra hour (or two) of operation in your target area prior to the public. Establish a communication with the group of scientists that handed the robot to you and use this time to introduce your special area to all citizens of this planet and tell something about you and your team.<br/>After your mission is over, you will be the ones that drive the rover for the first time in the next target area and so assist in introducing this location to the world. What about adding a special gift from your project as rover payload for the next group of scientists?<br/></p>
<h4>Telepresence</h4>
<p>These days, news are spread quicker than ever in history, nonetheless you rarely get information at first hand. As a rover operator you can decide, where the camera points to. You get remote access to a piece of this planet that would otherwise be out of range. <b>I am curious how this will change the way we see foreign countries!<br/></b></p>

<h4>It's all about ""Physical Computing""...</h4>
<p>As soon as people get excited about technology, the next step is to turn
 them into makers, creating own projects. That's why this is an open 
source project, handing all schematics and software to the community.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463984585/indiegogo_electronics_c50xxl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Deutsche Version</p>The robot computes with a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino Uno. An essential part of this project is to teach how to switch motors and LEDs, how to control servos or how to read sensor data using General Purpose Input Output pins (GPIOs).<br/><h4>...and ""big data""</h4>
<p>The sensor data of the rover will be transmitted to your browser and it will be recorded on a special project page for later examination. With this world tour I'd like to demonstrate, how to process large amounts of sensor data and how to display results using web technologies.<br/></p>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>The tour is planned to last for one earth year. An average time of 14 days will be needed to send the robot to it's next destination and to prepare that landing area, thus <b>the number of missions is around 26</b>. There will be a voting about candidates for landing areas if more applications are submitted. Since all continents should be visited by the robot, not only the number of votes counts.<br/><b>The start of the tour is scheduled for September 2016.</b></p>
<h2>What the money is needed for</h2>
<ul>
<li>Even if no rocket is needed to send the robot around planet earth, parcel services aren't for free (or does your shipping company want to participate?).<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>An Internet server running Perl scripts and forwarding video streams is needed to transmit data from the rover to your browser (another company out there, ready to help me?).</li></ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul><li>Creating the robot shown in the video was a relative cheap task, but it has some drawbacks, thus more expensive components are needed to create a robust vehicle.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Sensors and more cameras have to be added to make the exploration of this planet more exciting.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Solar cells with a better efficiency would be nice.</li></ul>
<ul><li>At least two robots have to be built to have a spare vehicle in case the original explorer fails completely. With the second rover in hand it will become more easy to fix hard- or software errors at it's distant counterpart. .<br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Many hours of coding will pass by to redesign the user interface, to establish some kind of chat software and to implement new features and sensors.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Education, thus documentation is an essential part of this project and also eats a lot of time, but students and makers need schematics as well as open sourced software to improve this project or to start a new one.</li></ul>
<ul><li>As you might have noticed, I am no native English speaking person. Spending some money for a professional translator might help to improve the grammar of the documentation concerning the world tour (or is there another company that would like to get involved?).<br/>
</li></ul>
<h2>What happens if the campaign doesn't reach the goal?</h2>
<p>Well, this project isn't just a campaign, it's my passion! If I fail to raise enough money to create a new robot and send it around the world, I will continue to invite the world to my home as I am doing for more than 4 year now. At least R5, the nameless prototype shown in the video will continue living in my garden or will be sent to several destination areas in Germany and you will have free access to this and all of my other robots. Each Euro will help to improve my <a href=""http://www.homofaciens.de/robospatium_en_navion.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RoboSpatium</a> that is already inspiring people all over the world. Be sure, your donation won't be a waste of money!<br/>Furthermore: A failure of this campaign doesn't mean I will give up my dream of exploring a planet with an open access roving vehicle...<br/></p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.homofaciens.de/robospatium_en_navion.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I am running remote controlled robots</a> for more than 4 years, thus the base technology exists and I have lots of experience in running it. Even with no enhancement to the existing technologies, the mission will be exciting - won't it? With this campaign I will add several features to a new robot and to the software used to control the vehicle. New hard- and software features usually means creating new bugs, which might delay the mission but not stop it.<br/>Running out of time isn't a problem - the tour can last for more than
 one earth year, but running out of money (e.g. too many broken rovers) might end the trip before all 
target areas can be visited.<br/>If you are still in doubt whether the world tour will start or not, <b>feel free to ask your questions</b>.<br/></p>

<p>Einige Angebote auf dieser Seite umfassen Text- und Audionachrichten an alle Erdlinge, die während der Missionen verbreitet werden. <a href=""http://www.homofaciens.de/robospatium-wall-of-fame-02_ge_navion.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Auf der Ehrentafel der Projektseite</a> findet ihr die Anleitung wie das vonstatten geht. <b>Beachtet die Regeln zum Inhalt.</b><br/></p>
<h4>Gewährt möglichst vielen Menschen Zugang zu dem Roboter</h4>
<p>Auch Einzelpersonen können eine Bewerbung um einen Landeplatz abgeben, aber wie wäre es damit, ein paar Menschen aus deinem Umfeld in die Mission einzubinden, um das Landegebiet auszustatten oder die Mission vorzubereiten? Mit Hilfe von Infrarot-Modulen kann der Rover mit Objekten im Zielgebiet interagieren. Instruktionen zu diesen Modulen und wie der Rover ans Internet anzubinden ist, werde ich zur Verfügung stellen und bei Problemen jederzeit helfen. Präpariert das Zielgebiet einige Tage vor Missionsbeginn. In diesem Zeitraum könnt ihr vielen Menschen aus eurer Umgebung den Roboter vorstellen.<br/></p>
<h4>Nach der Mission ist vor der nächsten Mission<br/>
</h4>
<p>Die Welttournee ist als Staffellauf ausgelegt. Die Gruppe, welche den Roboter zu euch gesendet hat, erhält eine extra Stunde (oder zwei), in denen diese den Roboter exklusiv steuert. Tretet in Verbindung mit euren Vorgängern und nutzt die Zeit, um euer Team und euer Missionsgebiet der Weltöffentlichkeit vorzustellen.<br/>Nach Ablauf eurer Mission seit ihr diejenigen, welche das nächste Zielgebiet als erste Forscher erkunden. Wie wär's mit einem kleinen Geschenk für eure Nachfolger als Nutzlast?<br/></p>
<h4>Telepräsenz</h4>
<p>Heutzutage verbreiten sich Neuigkeiten schneller als je zuvor in der Menschheitsgeschichte, dennoch erhält man Berichte selten aus erster Hand. Als Roverfahrer könnt ihr entscheiden, wohin die Kamera zeigt und wohin gefahren werden soll. Ihr erhaltet Zugang zu einem entfernt liegenden Teil des Planeten, der ansonsten außer Reichweite wäre. <b>Ich bin neugierig, in welcher Form das die Sichtweise auf fremde Länder ändert!<br/></b></p>

</div></div>","Explore a Planet The goal of this campaign is to create a planetary exploration vehicle and to send it around planet earth by a relay tour crossing preferably all continents and as many countries as possible.
Get involved
Leave comments on the project page with your ideas regarding the hardware design or special features of the rover, the paintwork or give the vehicle a name.



Get in touch
This rover gives all people a hand on technology. You can control the robot easily by using a web browser. Try the robots in my RoboSpatium to see how it works.
Rent this robot
Just driving my robots isn't enough? There is something exciting you'd like to show all earthlings? Become part of the world tour and provide a landing area for this rover. Use this robot to introduce your country or the project(s) you are working on! The rover is for indoor and outdoor terrain, thus your target area can be a stone pit, your garden, a museum, a gallery or exhibition room, your school or university or...Sending the rover to your landing area will be free of charge and of course there is no rental rate to pay. A gift (e.g. Raspberry Pi or Arduino) will be sent to all landing areas, saying thank you for your participation.Get the word out and share this campaign with your friends, teachers or your boss or whoever might be interested in providing a mission target for the rover's world tour. Don't forget about the Indiegogo share tools, Facebook Twitter, Google+ and so on.



Broadcast personal messages to earthlings
Some perks include a text and audio message to all earthlings, which will be broadcast during rover operation. See how it works and note the rules for creating your personal message  on the supporter wall of the project page.
Give many people physical access to the robot
You can make an application for a landing area as a single person, but what about inviting some people to assist you in making the landing area more exciting? Through an infrared interface, the rover can interact with objects close to it. You will get instructions in how to connect the rover to your network infrastructure and how to establish communication between remote modules. Prepare your area several days before the rover goes live. In this period you can teach many people how the robot works or simply give them a hand on the tiny explorer.
After your mission is before the next mission - get connected.
The world tour will be a relay race. The group that sent the robot to you will get an extra hour (or two) of operation in your target area prior to the public. Establish a communication with the group of scientists that handed the robot to you and use this time to introduce your special area to all citizens of this planet and tell something about you and your team.After your mission is over, you will be the ones that drive the rover for the first time in the next target area and so assist in introducing this location to the world. What about adding a special gift from your project as rover payload for the next group of scientists?
Telepresence
These days, news are spread quicker than ever in history, nonetheless you rarely get information at first hand. As a rover operator you can decide, where the camera points to. You get remote access to a piece of this planet that would otherwise be out of range. I am curious how this will change the way we see foreign countries!

It's all about ""Physical Computing""...
As soon as people get excited about technology, the next step is to turn
 them into makers, creating own projects. That's why this is an open 
source project, handing all schematics and software to the community.
Deutsche VersionThe robot computes with a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino Uno. An essential part of this project is to teach how to switch motors and LEDs, how to control servos or how to read sensor data using General Purpose Input Output pins (GPIOs)....and ""big data""
The sensor data of the rover will be transmitted to your browser and it will be recorded on a special project page for later examination. With this world tour I'd like to demonstrate, how to process large amounts of sensor data and how to display results using web technologies.
Schedule
The tour is planned to last for one earth year. An average time of 14 days will be needed to send the robot to it's next destination and to prepare that landing area, thus the number of missions is around 26. There will be a voting about candidates for landing areas if more applications are submitted. Since all continents should be visited by the robot, not only the number of votes counts.The start of the tour is scheduled for September 2016.
What the money is needed for

Even if no rocket is needed to send the robot around planet earth, parcel services aren't for free (or does your shipping company want to participate?).


An Internet server running Perl scripts and forwarding video streams is needed to transmit data from the rover to your browser (another company out there, ready to help me?).


Creating the robot shown in the video was a relative cheap task, but it has some drawbacks, thus more expensive components are needed to create a robust vehicle.
Sensors and more cameras have to be added to make the exploration of this planet more exciting.
Solar cells with a better efficiency would be nice.
At least two robots have to be built to have a spare vehicle in case the original explorer fails completely. With the second rover in hand it will become more easy to fix hard- or software errors at it's distant counterpart. .

Many hours of coding will pass by to redesign the user interface, to establish some kind of chat software and to implement new features and sensors.
Education, thus documentation is an essential part of this project and also eats a lot of time, but students and makers need schematics as well as open sourced software to improve this project or to start a new one.
As you might have noticed, I am no native English speaking person. Spending some money for a professional translator might help to improve the grammar of the documentation concerning the world tour (or is there another company that would like to get involved?).

What happens if the campaign doesn't reach the goal?
Well, this project isn't just a campaign, it's my passion! If I fail to raise enough money to create a new robot and send it around the world, I will continue to invite the world to my home as I am doing for more than 4 year now. At least R5, the nameless prototype shown in the video will continue living in my garden or will be sent to several destination areas in Germany and you will have free access to this and all of my other robots. Each Euro will help to improve my RoboSpatium that is already inspiring people all over the world. Be sure, your donation won't be a waste of money!Furthermore: A failure of this campaign doesn't mean I will give up my dream of exploring a planet with an open access roving vehicle...
Risks & Challenges
I am running remote controlled robots for more than 4 years, thus the base technology exists and I have lots of experience in running it. Even with no enhancement to the existing technologies, the mission will be exciting - won't it? With this campaign I will add several features to a new robot and to the software used to control the vehicle. New hard- and software features usually means creating new bugs, which might delay the mission but not stop it.Running out of time isn't a problem - the tour can last for more than
 one earth year, but running out of money (e.g. too many broken rovers) might end the trip before all 
target areas can be visited.If you are still in doubt whether the world tour will start or not, feel free to ask your questions.

http://www.solarflask.com
A Portable Solar Renewable Hot Water System For Your Camping Adventure Allows You to Boil Water Using only The Suns Energy !


I have close to 13 years in machine tooling,35 Years in construction.I have almost always had a project going of some sort always building something interesting and am now able build even more complex ideas into reality using Fusion 360 software .I know where and how to find manufactures and how to get things built .I have had in the past a import export license so am familiar with the process  of acquiring needed parts and pieces from overseas.  
I have built at least 50 websites and have built a site for solar flask that will better explain what and how solar Flask will work and it's overall flexibility.

Please visit my site for more info on product .
http://www.solarflask.com
It's main use is for boiling water using integrated Fresnel lenses  in cylinder walls to super heat flask contents - not just limited to water but also to make stews , soups any recipe you wish to cook up   .The Solar Flask is a multi-use product that has many interchangeable parts .The upper cap can be changed out for a solar powered night light so that main cylinder can be changed into a lamp for night use.The cap can also hold a candelabra to hang hotdogs to solar cook them and also be used as Shish Ka Bob. There will also be a stainless steel cage to hold vegetables for cooking  .
 
This product will grow as more and more new parts are added .

I will be adding a auxiliary top cap with solar panel and led lighting so that at night the flask can be used for camp lighting while not being used to heat water .
Status ++ = completed !
--------------------------------------
A secondary main cylinder that can be screwed on to main cylinder for additional heating area and a taller stainless steel flask to go along with it for additional volume .
--------------------------------------
I will also be adding a stainless steel cage / Candelabra style  to hold vegetables for cooking .
---------------------------------------
A stainless steel cage /Candelabra style to hold lots of  hot dogs and also to be used as Shish Ka Bob.
Status ++ = completed !
-----------------------------------------
A stainless steel hook rack  to hold several golf ball sized or larger stainless steel balls that can be super heated to be then dropped into your coffee or tea  or dropped into a bowl of soup , 
-------------------------------------------
Longer set of legs to elevate solar flask higher into suns rays .
------------------------------------------
A secondary lower base with manual spring power ( Called Main Spring ) to rotate flask to keep it evenly heating .
------------------------------------------
A cylinder shaped solar panel that will fit inside main cylinder to harvest solar energy=
Status ++ = Changed to exterior - separate mirrored refractive lens
========================
My projects as close to complete now as far as conceptual design goes and I now need to actually begin build out and I need your help

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Jordan and I am the creator and lead developer of Jaunt. Jaunt is a social travel app that allows you to plot your adventures around the globe and share them with the people around you. Upload images along the way to inspire others and make your mates jealous!</p>
<p>So we welcome you to join us on our jaunt from idea to travelling the world with our app!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488216913/qttoojambn4g3wplqm5h.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The History Behind The App</h2>
<p>Are you fed up of hearing sob stories about why people need your money to fund their product or service? Yes? So are we! Which is exactly why we won't bore you with one!</p>
<p>The concept for Jaunt was born back in May 2016 when my three best friends and I went on an epic 6500 mile road trip across America. For the previous two years I was stuck in a dead end IT Manager position in a local company with little to no job satisfaction, never mind the will to live.</p>
<p>All the plans had been finalised for the trip to America and it was time for me to ask for three weeks off work for this potentially once in a lifetime trip. I went in to see the boss man and asked him for the time off. This wasn’t the first time that I had asked for holidays before so I thought nothing of it.</p>
<p>To my amazement his reaction was like nothing else I had ever seen before. It was as if I had just told him that I was planning to murder his family!</p>
<p>Long story short, my resignation was on his desk by the end of the day!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489488727/csoneulg0yeoy6l1hcpe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>There was no chance I was missing this trip!</strong></p>
<p>With the America trip booked, very little money saved and no job to come home to apart from some web design work to finish off I was feeling pretty nervous. But for the first time in the last 2 years I was actually very happy with my life!</p>
<p>On the morning of the trip we finally left Dublin and flew to Pittsburgh via Boston. This is when I found out that my connecting flight in Boston was different from the others, leaving me stranded for 2 hours. Whilst I was left in the airport by myself I began flicking through Facebook saw that some of my mates were having the time of their lives out in India trying to find their inner self or some garbage like that!</p>
<p>This got me thinking, I wanted to be that guy posting those photos that made you want to tell your boss to stick their job so you could go travelling. Then I started looking for an app that would allow me to upload photos on a map that would plot our epic journey. After a search online the only people that seemed to have something close was Apple and to be honest it just didn’t have the functionality I would have wanted.</p>
<p>And in that instant Jaunt was born. Jaunt is a social travel app that will allow you to plot your adventures around the globe and share them with the people around you. Upload images along the way to inspire others and make your mates jealous! With the search functionality you will also be able to use Jaunt to plan your next trip using the in app planning tool.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Plans</h2>
<p>Right, down to the business side of things. I know what I have to say may sound incredibly boring but apparently this stuff is important. The Jaunt team have all sat down and set out some targets for where we want to be by the end of the year.</p>
<p>I just want to make it clear that these dates are only a guideline and most of the future deadlines depend on the success of this crowdfunding campaign. Below is an infograph that shows our journey into the unknown. We have also included a few past dates to show what has been happening behind the scenes for almost a year now.</p>

<p>As you can see from the timeline above we are looking to have the app through most of the development and testing phases by the end of the year. As mentioned before this all depends on getting the funding we need to work on the app full time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>March 2017</h3>
<p>March is going to be both exciting and scary for us as we are planning to start funding through grants and also our IndieGoGo campaign.</p>
<p>Before starting the app development process we had no idea how much we would actually need to build the app never mind sustain the amount of users we are expecting each month. We are currently looking at an estimated monthly running cost of around £1200 before we even take into consideration the cost of paying our team - who are currently working for free!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>June 2017</h3>
<p>By June 2017 we would like to be at the stage where we are able to offer the app to close friends, select travel enthusiasts and also our generous crowdfunding backers on Android! This early version of the app will allow you to plot a map on your travels, upload images and search for your maps your friends have created.</p>
<p>At this stage the app will have basic functionality while we work out the bugs that will inevitably occur. During this time we will hold a server crash party where we will stress test the servers in the hope that we push them to the limit! For all involved there will be a reward if we can crash them! So sign up to our newsletter to keep up to date!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>December 2017</h3>
<p>Our December goal is to start our public beta programme that will allow invited users to download the app and start plotting their Jaunts. By this stage we are hoping that most of the apps’ functionality will be finished, but don’t think this is the end; we have plenty more in store for the future of Jaunt!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>With your help, the £10,000 will help us set up our own private servers and enable us to work full time on the app. With us working on the app full time we hope to hit our public beta release date by the end of December 2017. At the minute the team are working for free, putting in every minute of their spare time into making the app a reality. We need funding to allow us to work consistently and to fuel our caffeine filled coding sessions!</p>
<p>Currently we do not have a stable working version of the app, meaning we can't offer it for download, but we are working on getting a sustainable version out as quickly as we can! When the campaign has ended we will ship out all our merchandise that you have selected through the perks. For everyone that backs our app you will also get a ""Friend of Jaunt"" badge beside your name that all future members will be able to see! All perks will gain you access to the Beta version of our app with some of the perks offering exclusive access to our Alpha release! You will be amongst the first to ever use the Jaunt app!</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>If we are able to hit our target of £10,000  we reckon it will take at least one year until the full release of the app. Helping us reach this milestone will not only mean a lot to us, but also ensure that you get the highest quality social travel app EVER, sooner! Currently the app is only being working on for release on the Google Play Store but your funding will also speed up the development and release on the App store.</p>
<p>The app will not only let you track and record your once in a lifetime journey, it will also allow you to plan it in advance with the handy planning tool that shows you similar Jaunts. These Jaunts will include blog posts, images and notes to help you decide where to visit while you are travelling.</p>
<p>If we are able to surpass the £10,000 target we are planning to add in extra features to the app sooner than expected as we will have the resources in place. These features could include integration with Airbnb, suggesting cheap places to stay while you're travelling along your Jaunt!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>With any project there are risks and challenges we will need to overcome with the app. These include bugs in the code, missed deadlines and server crashes.</p>
<p>All the mentioned risks and challenges above can and will be overcome with your help from being part of the exclusive Alpha and Beta programmes outlined in the perks. But don't let this put you off as we will do absolutely everything within our control to keep our app bug and crash free while hitting the deadlines we have put in place!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Unless you are a ""Genius Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist"" or a top class computer programmer at Google the only other way you can help us apart from funding the app is to share us on your social media pages.</p>
<p>Essentially the more people that share and like the project, the more funding we get, and the sooner we are going to be able to finish the app release it for everyone to use!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>I would just like to take this chance to thank you wonderful people around me for helping so much to get Jaunt to where it is right now:</p>

</div></div>","About Us
Hi, I'm Jordan and I am the creator and lead developer of Jaunt. Jaunt is a social travel app that allows you to plot your adventures around the globe and share them with the people around you. Upload images along the way to inspire others and make your mates jealous!
So we welcome you to join us on our jaunt from idea to travelling the world with our app!

 
The History Behind The App
Are you fed up of hearing sob stories about why people need your money to fund their product or service? Yes? So are we! Which is exactly why we won't bore you with one!
The concept for Jaunt was born back in May 2016 when my three best friends and I went on an epic 6500 mile road trip across America. For the previous two years I was stuck in a dead end IT Manager position in a local company with little to no job satisfaction, never mind the will to live.
All the plans had been finalised for the trip to America and it was time for me to ask for three weeks off work for this potentially once in a lifetime trip. I went in to see the boss man and asked him for the time off. This wasn’t the first time that I had asked for holidays before so I thought nothing of it.
To my amazement his reaction was like nothing else I had ever seen before. It was as if I had just told him that I was planning to murder his family!
Long story short, my resignation was on his desk by the end of the day!

There was no chance I was missing this trip!
With the America trip booked, very little money saved and no job to come home to apart from some web design work to finish off I was feeling pretty nervous. But for the first time in the last 2 years I was actually very happy with my life!
On the morning of the trip we finally left Dublin and flew to Pittsburgh via Boston. This is when I found out that my connecting flight in Boston was different from the others, leaving me stranded for 2 hours. Whilst I was left in the airport by myself I began flicking through Facebook saw that some of my mates were having the time of their lives out in India trying to find their inner self or some garbage like that!
This got me thinking, I wanted to be that guy posting those photos that made you want to tell your boss to stick their job so you could go travelling. Then I started looking for an app that would allow me to upload photos on a map that would plot our epic journey. After a search online the only people that seemed to have something close was Apple and to be honest it just didn’t have the functionality I would have wanted.
And in that instant Jaunt was born. Jaunt is a social travel app that will allow you to plot your adventures around the globe and share them with the people around you. Upload images along the way to inspire others and make your mates jealous! With the search functionality you will also be able to use Jaunt to plan your next trip using the in app planning tool.
 
Our Plans
Right, down to the business side of things. I know what I have to say may sound incredibly boring but apparently this stuff is important. The Jaunt team have all sat down and set out some targets for where we want to be by the end of the year.
I just want to make it clear that these dates are only a guideline and most of the future deadlines depend on the success of this crowdfunding campaign. Below is an infograph that shows our journey into the unknown. We have also included a few past dates to show what has been happening behind the scenes for almost a year now.

As you can see from the timeline above we are looking to have the app through most of the development and testing phases by the end of the year. As mentioned before this all depends on getting the funding we need to work on the app full time.

<h2><strong>Fire in the Hole Stoves</strong></h2>
<p>Fire in the Hole Stoves are the most rugged, dependable outdoor cooking solution available.</p>
<p>Dissatisfied with flimsy, cheaply made alternatives, I set out a few years ago to create a rocket stove that would enable me to reliably generate intense, sustained heat while cooking over wood.</p>
<p>After years of experimentation, I perfected a design that allows me to enjoy two of my greatest passions: Being outdoors and cooking great food. I'm confident that you will love our stoves and that they will bring you years of enjoyment.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508765516/dpbyplhmcojwz6be7fxe.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Quality to Last a Lifetime</h2>
<p>Many companies value quantity over quality. They produce high-volume, poorly-made products overseas—products that wear out quickly and break with the slightest rough treatment. Profit is the bottom line, not excellence.</p>
<p><strong>At Fire in the Hole Stoves, we are committed to quality, and all of our stoves are designed to last a lifetime</strong>. Our stoves are made of heavy, high-gauge steel and are nearly indestructible (they're even bulletproof up to .223, we checked!). Whether you're cooking out off-grid or in your back yard, these stoves will provide you with decades of intensive use. <strong>These stoves are proudly designed and manufactured in Oklahoma, USA and come with a lifetime warranty.</strong></p>

<h2>Unique Design </h2>
<p>After years of experimentation, I perfected a stove design that offers an excellent cooking experience. It's heavy duty but portable, and efficient but much higher capacity than any other rocket stove available. <strong>You won't find another rocket stove quite like it.</strong></p>
<p>The angled chamber provides optimum airflow and auto feeds the fuel, while the built-in cleaning tool makes maintaining a blaze and emptying ashes easy. The large cooking surface allows you to use a variety of skillets, dutch ovens, and griddles based on your cooking needs. The carry handle makes  transportation simple and convenient. </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Cook Delicious Food Anywhere</h2>
<p>Our stoves are rugged enough to keep you cooking during a natural disaster or an economic collapse (keeping our fingers crossed that doesn't happen!). They're portable enough to use as a camp stove in the middle of nowhere. And yes, they're also perfect for cooking on your back patio with friends on a summer evening. </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Simple and Efficient</h2>
<p>Fire in the Hole Stoves are perfect for the experienced cook or the complete beginner. They're even easy enough for kids to use (<i><strong>with parental oversight, of course</strong></i>). If you can collect a few pieces of wood and light a match, you can use a Fire in the Hole stove.</p>

Most of the available tools have been designed to do a very limited number of functions well and are often compromised due to size (too small and thin) and over complexity.After many conversations with my fellow DIYers, adventures, the days by boat , jams of replicas in paintball and softair, I learned I was not alone, we were all looking for not just a multi-tool, but a survival machine, that could solve the problems at that time and in that situation! It was then I set out to design a multi-tool with high functionality and a wide versatility of features housed in an compact architecture. Thank you for your support !The AXEM4.0 was designed with the desire to create an object that is both beautiful and functional.Machined from a solid steel block, with satin finish, for the pleasure of having an object in your hands, a consistent object of the right size.Because we draw with the heart!The AXEM4.0 was developed using an iterative design process globally practiced in industrial and product design.  Designs were first sketched and then built in with advanced 3D software to create prototypes for 3D printing.  Prototypes were 3D printed in plastic, then measured, tested, and refined until every detail performed its job perfectly.ONE product, so many functions: The AXEM4.0 is not a simple multitool, but a survival machine that everyone should own.This survivor pocket tool is an essential product that neatly and discreetly fits in your wallet, pocket, backpack, glove compartment, or purse. It's an axe, saw, wrench, spear head, bottle opener, cutter, and  other many functions. You'll be amazed that such a small product can do so much.The top side has a razor-edge blade that can be utilized as a knife to cut things like rope, kindling, meat.

</p><p></p><p></p><h1>About This Project</h1><p>Have you ever wished there was a product that could monitor, issue alerts, and track your vehicle, bike or child or any other moving asset,  but ONLY when they move out of range or are in your absence? We do as well!  And that's exactly why we are developing the MDP Device and Apps. But we need your support to complete its development so that we can offer the product to the general public. Please continue reading...</p><p>Imagine the peace of mind you will have if, for example, you are  visiting Disney Land with your children and one of them wanders off.  Instead of panicking, you will be able to track them and locate them immediately. Our tracking device is designed to monitor your 2 to 10-year-old child, typically the age group  that does not have a smart phone. <br/></p><p></p><p>MDP is the first versatile tracking product that even protects user's privacy. It consists of:</p><ul>
<li>The MDP Device - Battery Powered Hardware</li>
<li>The MDP App - for iOS and Android Phones</li>
<li>The MDP Server - the Backend Server</li>
</ul><p>The MDP Device and App communicate with each other via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When the MDP Device and a phone (on which the MDP App runs) are within range (15 meters) of each other, the MDP App tracks the asset and MDP Device goes into idle mode. In order to protect  user's privacy, all tracking data remains locally on the phone and is not transmitted to any Backend Serve . However, when the phone is out of range and yet the object that is carrying the MDP Device is moving, the MDP Device turns on its built-in GNSS (GPS) receiver and Cellular Modem, tracks the asset and immediately notifies the user on his/her phone via remote push notification.</p><p>The MDP App allows the user to easily change the type of the asset that is being tracked from the default Vehicle/Motorbike to Person (Child/Elderly) or Bicycle, as shown in the App screenshots below. Users may also adjust the radius of the geo-fencing circle for receiving alerts when the Person exits it.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432055438/cr5ms8uk2memkxj0dlt4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432055482/pr9fc3vqwhbeychmg91t.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                        <br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430517284/sxzddujjvytxkchnmbur.png"" src="""" style=""width: 205.268px; height: 363px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1386222/files/20150415131229-IMG_1471.PNG?1429128749"" src="""" style=""width: 203.382px; height: 360px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1386223/files/20150415131250-IMG_1472.PNG?1429128770"" src="""" style=""width: 202.684px; height: 360px;""/></p><p><b>How about our bikes?</b> We park them outside a coffee shop and by the time we return, they're gone!</p><p>That's too bad, but no worries ! If your bike is equipped with the MDP device (placed under the seat), you would immediately receive an alert on your phone and could track it on map, no matter how far it moves away. The range is unlimited, because the MDP Device comes with built-in GNSS (GPS) and Cellular modem and will find the location of the bike with an accuracy level of meters, anywhere in the world.</p><p><b>Car getting too hot?</b> MDP Device is equipped with temperature sensor and ambient sound detector. If interior temperature of the car gets too hot and it hears noise from inside (pet, child, etc.), MDP App immediately delivers warning (via remote push notification) on user's phone, if he/she is not in close proximity of the car.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432130361/gak9kzrrnr4whsldxhd7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432130391/hh09wfnsgwm82y203e0u.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>How about locating our Quadcopters or Drones?</b><br/><br/>Drones - strictly speaking, ‘multicopters’ - are ubiquitous now.

Wouldn't it be nice if we had a product that automatically record our trips and could show where and how long ago the vehicle was parked. Additionally, if someone is foolish enough to attempt to steal it, you will receive alert immediately on your phone and be able to track it on a map. This feature will help you as well as law enforcement get your vehicle back to you in record time - and mete out justice!<br/>
</p><p>It doesn't matter if you are a professional runner or a casual walker like me, the  MDP App allows you to manually record your walking, running, biking, or driving trips. It shows the route on a map and updates the  distance and duration of the trip in real-time in both US (foot, mile) and Metric (meter, kilometer) units. The Trips History page of the MDP App lists up to <b>20 previous trips, </b>as shown in screenshots below. The user has the option to delete those they do not wish to keep. The App will automatically overwrite the earliest entry.<br/>

There are some cellular based tracking devices in the market that claim to be able to determine the location within 100 meters accuracy level, but don't believe it! To prove it for yourself, use an Android phone and run a Network Location App, like <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dten.tracker&amp;hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Network Location Tracker</a>,  to find out how poor the accuracy is, even when there are several cellular towers around the phone. Actual accuracy of these systems is from several hundred meters to a few kilometers. They determine a device's location by scanning nearby GSM cellular towers. The Location of cellular towers are mostly known (check <a href=""http://opencellid.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Opencellid</a> for example) and distance to each tower can be roughly estimated from  the strength of the received cellular signal. To achieve even a 500 meter accuracy, a strong signal from three or more GSM cellular towers needs to be received. This is not possible in many regions. Out of the biggest US carriers, only AT&amp;T and T-Mobile run on GSM networks, while Verizon and Sprint use CDMA technology. So, the three cellular towers mentioned above can only be from AT&amp;T or T-Mobile.<br/><p>                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432146260/tlcjcdbk3pttojofzaai.png"" src="""" style=""width: 457.91px; height: 397px;""/></p>

You can disable the Automatic recording on the Setting page of the App if you don't want your trips recorded. <br/><br/><b>16) How is my privacy protected? </b><br/>Neither the MDP App nor the MDP Device sends any location data to the backend server; the location data are all stored locally on the phone or in the device. Only when the  phone and the MDP Device are out of range and the object carrying the MDP Device is moving, does the MDP Device send the position data to the MDP Server, so that it may notify the user about the event. <br/><br/><b>17) Can I delete one of my previous trips on the App? </b><br/>Absolutely, Trips History page of the App shows information of the previous 20 trips. Any of these trips can be easily deleted by swiping to the left on the table's row for that trip. <br/><br/>
</p></div>","About This ProjectHave you ever wished there was a product that could monitor, issue alerts, and track your vehicle, bike or child or any other moving asset,  but ONLY when they move out of range or are in your absence? We do as well!  And that's exactly why we are developing the MDP Device and Apps. But we need your support to complete its development so that we can offer the product to the general public. Please continue reading...Imagine the peace of mind you will have if, for example, you are  visiting Disney Land with your children and one of them wanders off.  Instead of panicking, you will be able to track them and locate them immediately. Our tracking device is designed to monitor your 2 to 10-year-old child, typically the age group  that does not have a smart phone. MDP is the first versatile tracking product that even protects user's privacy. It consists of:
The MDP Device - Battery Powered Hardware
The MDP App - for iOS and Android Phones
The MDP Server - the Backend Server
The MDP Device and App communicate with each other via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When the MDP Device and a phone (on which the MDP App runs) are within range (15 meters) of each other, the MDP App tracks the asset and MDP Device goes into idle mode. In order to protect  user's privacy, all tracking data remains locally on the phone and is not transmitted to any Backend Serve . However, when the phone is out of range and yet the object that is carrying the MDP Device is moving, the MDP Device turns on its built-in GNSS (GPS) receiver and Cellular Modem, tracks the asset and immediately notifies the user on his/her phone via remote push notification.The MDP App allows the user to easily change the type of the asset that is being tracked from the default Vehicle/Motorbike to Person (Child/Elderly) or Bicycle, as shown in the App screenshots below. Users may also adjust the radius of the geo-fencing circle for receiving alerts when the Person exits it.                            How about our bikes? We park them outside a coffee shop and by the time we return, they're gone!That's too bad, but no worries ! If your bike is equipped with the MDP device (placed under the seat), you would immediately receive an alert on your phone and could track it on map, no matter how far it moves away. The range is unlimited, because the MDP Device comes with built-in GNSS (GPS) and Cellular modem and will find the location of the bike with an accuracy level of meters, anywhere in the world.Car getting too hot? MDP Device is equipped with temperature sensor and ambient sound detector. If interior temperature of the car gets too hot and it hears noise from inside (pet, child, etc.), MDP App immediately delivers warning (via remote push notification) on user's phone, if he/she is not in close proximity of the car.How about locating our Quadcopters or Drones?Drones - strictly speaking, ‘multicopters’ - are ubiquitous now. We see them in the news, behind the camera filming aerial footage, and more frequently in parks. There is something thrilling about zooming through the air, controlling the futuristic device from your mobile phone. If you are one of these guys, then I bet you would also love MDP. You can place (or attach) an MDP Device inside your drone to track it in real-time on your phone and obviously locate it with meters level accuracy, if you ever lose it.Can the MDP Device track driving trips?The simple answer is: Yes. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a product that automatically record our trips and could show where and how long ago the vehicle was parked. Additionally, if someone is foolish enough to attempt to steal it, you will receive alert immediately on your phone and be able to track it on a map. This feature will help you as well as law enforcement get your vehicle back to you in record time - and mete out justice!
It doesn't matter if you are a professional runner or a casual walker like me, the  MDP App allows you to manually record your walking, running, biking, or driving trips. It shows the route on a map and updates the  distance and duration of the trip in real-time in both US (foot, mile) and Metric (meter, kilometer) units. The Trips History page of the MDP App lists up to 20 previous trips, as shown in screenshots below. The user has the option to delete those they do not wish to keep. The App will automatically overwrite the earliest entry.
    Size of MDPThe MDP Device comes in two models for this campaign:
MDP Device 1
MDP Device 1s

As shown in the image below, the ""MDP Device 1"" is slightly bigger than a credit card, but fairly thin at  10 mm (about the thickness of iPhone 4S). ""MDP Device 1s"" is smaller than a credit card, but a little thicker at 15 mm. The MDP Device 1s easily fits under a bike's saddle (seat).MDP Device Colors

3) Do you provide the SIM card? Yes, The MDP Device is shipped with a factory-installed SIM card. You DON'T need to buy your own SIM card and pay for the service. 
4) How long does the battery last on one charge? We are using a 1500 mAh rechargeable Lithium battery in MDP Device. Depending on the usage, the battery may last between 1 to +6 months. The later is when MDP is used mostly to monitor a vehicle (car, motor-bike, bike, etc.) with occasional (couple of times, each 2-3 hours, per month) use for monitoring a person (child, elderly, etc.). The former is when MDP is used 6-8 hours every day for monitoring a person.
MDP Device is most of the time in idle mode (only accelerometer and/or Bluetooth Low Energy being active), only when asset (car, child, bike, etc.) moves out of range, it starts tracking the object. Other times, MDP App is aware of the situation. 
5) Is MDP iOS App compatible with my iPhone? iPhone 4s and newer are compatible with the MDP App. 6) Is MDP iOS App available for download now? If so, how can I access it? Yes, we have published our iOS Apps on TestFlight site of iTunes. Please email us at info@mydrivingpal.com, if you would like to test it. We need the email address for adding you to the list of the external testers on TestFlight. You will receive an email from iTunes  that contains a link to download our iOS App. 7) Is MDP Android App compatible with my Android phone? The majority of new Android phones support Bluetooth Low Energy. To check if your Android phone supports it, please check this website. 8) Is MDP Android App available for download now? If so, how can I access it? No, the Android version is in development right now. Please email us at info@mydrivingpal.com,
 if you would like us to notify you as soon as it becomes available. We are planning to release it by July 15th of 2015. 9) How can I recharge the battery inside my MDP Device? The MDP Device is rechargeable via mini USB cable (similar to Android phones). 10) Is MDP device water resistant? MDP Device 1 is water resistant enough to resist rain and ambient moisture. MDP Device 1s is waterproof.11) Does MDP Device have cellular modem, GPS or Bluetooth inside? Yes, it has built-in GSM cellular modem, assisted GNSS (GPS) receiver, and Bluetooth Low Energy (also known as BTLE, BLE, or Bluetooth 4.0). 12) Is it possible to turn the device off? Yes, you  simply press the power button on the side of the device to turn it off. 13) How can I change type of the asset (object) that MDP monitors? On the MDP App, press the drop-down menu button in the upper right corner of the screen, then tap on Settings. Now you can switch the type of  asset from Vehicle/Motorcycle to Person (Child/Elderly) or Bicycle. Please note that at the time of this change, the device needs to be in range and connected with the phone via BLE. 14) How can I manually force MDP Device to do Bluetooth advertising? You can turn the Device off and then back on to force Bluetooth Advertising for minimum of 60 seconds. 15) Does the MDP App automatically record my driving trips? Yes, by default when the MDP Device is placed inside a car or motorbike, in combination with the MDP App, they automatically record the trips. You can disable the Automatic recording on the Setting page of the App if you don't want your trips recorded. 16) How is my privacy protected? Neither the MDP App nor the MDP Device sends any location data to the backend server; the location data are all stored locally on the phone or in the device. Only when the  phone and the MDP Device are out of range and the object carrying the MDP Device is moving, does the MDP Device send the position data to the MDP Server, so that it may notify the user about the event. 17) Can I delete one of my previous trips on the App? Absolutely, Trips History page of the App shows information of the previous 20 trips. Any of these trips can be easily deleted by swiping to the left on the table's row for that trip.",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Last year we introduced BULLET: World's Smallest LED Flashlight. We are back again, now with an even more minimal design, inspired by the iconic 40 S&amp;W round. </p>
<p>Introducing BULLET 02: <b><i>World's Smallest LED Flashlight, Even Smaller.</i></b></p>

<p>We wanted to create something better and solve all the issues that the first Bullet faced. So we went back to the drawing board and started a complete redesign. </p>

<p>We believe that your everyday carry essentials are a reflection of you and your lifestyle. BULLET 02 not only is functional, beautiful and minimal, but its new design makes it the <i><b>best, most resistant everyday carry tiny LED flashlight available.</b></i></p>

<p>Rain, sleet, hail, snow, heat and most importantly of all, water. Meaning BULLET 02 can be submerged underwater for a total of 5 minutes without any water breaching it's seals. It will illuminate in any weather and in any situation, helping you solve any problem.</p>

<p>Our first design wasn't enough. We came up with an even smaller design, added a spring lock mechanism to increase pressure inside of the casing. We also added a longer stem with fine threading to avoid BULLET 02 from unlatching. We combined that with premium aircraft grade aluminum alloy for a refined finish. </p>

</div></div>","Last year we introduced BULLET: World's Smallest LED Flashlight. We are back again, now with an even more minimal design, inspired by the iconic 40 S&W round. 
Introducing BULLET 02: World's Smallest LED Flashlight, Even Smaller.

 

We wanted to create something better and solve all the issues that the first Bullet faced. So we went back to the drawing board and started a complete redesign. 

The uber minimal design makes it even smaller than it's counterpart. BULLET 02 can be attached to virtually anything. Your gym bag, your jacket, your keys. Suitable for any indoor or outdoor situation.

 

 
We believe that your everyday carry essentials are a reflection of you and your lifestyle. BULLET 02 not only is functional, beautiful and minimal, but its new design makes it the best, most resistant everyday carry tiny LED flashlight available.

BULLET 02 will feature a quick 180 degree rotation that is spring locked for secure on/off operation. The Bullet 02 will not unlatch even under the most vigorous conditions. 

 

Pushing the boundaries was our goal- How can we make BULLET better? Waterproof. More minimal. More secure. Smaller. Brighter. And most important of all, indestructible.
Available in Matte Gunmetal
 
Matte Black and Matte Brass
 

 

 

We designed Bullet 02 with resistance in mind. We wanted to create a flashlight so durable, it will last in any condition and under any circumstances. We even ran over it with an SUV.

 

Designed with aerospace-grade aluminum and a sleek anodized treatment, BULLET 02 is built for any situation possible. 

Rain, sleet, hail, snow, heat and most importantly of all, water. Meaning BULLET 02 can be submerged underwater for a total of 5 minutes without any water breaching it's seals. It will illuminate in any weather and in any situation, helping you solve any problem.

Our first design wasn't enough. We came up with an even smaller design, added a spring lock mechanism to increase pressure inside of the casing. We also added a longer stem with fine threading to avoid BULLET 02 from unlatching. We combined that with premium aircraft grade aluminum alloy for a refined finish. 

Measuring in at an incredible 10mm x 26mm and weighing only 5 grams, BULLET 02 is the perfect sized flashlight for modern day wear. Powered by three LR41 Button Cell batteries to produce 20 lumens of light, keep it with you at all times, anywhere you go. 

What makes us different? We eliminate the bulk, weight, and hassle from traditional everyday carry flashlights, creating a seamless experience for you every single day.
Our competition isn't too competitive now, is it?
 

 
One of the main features we wanted to redesign was our previous ""Twist Operation"". We have improved this by creating a new mechanism altogether.

In addition, adding a gold plated spring inside for optimal conductivity and pressure, for keeping Bullet 02 snug and sturdy at all times.
We wanted to keep the minimal design without unnecessary buttons to keep it slick. With the new spring lock operation, it won't ever open unintentionally.

<h3>
<strong>The Story of Rwanda Enduro</strong> </h3>
<p>Hi there! My name is Moses King, I lived in Rwanda for 15 years, and my last year there I started a mountain bike race. This race is a 3 day race where riders ride the hills of Rwanda. I raced my first mountain bike race at age 12 with the Africa Rising Cycling Center. I was excited to compete in another race, but no one organized another one. So, I decided to do it myself. The process was long and much harder than I thought to balance school and organize a bike race for the first time. I managed to make it happen in May 2019, and I have been planning to make the Rwanda Enduro an annual event. For the event March 12-14, 2021, I look forward to a successful event. (Take a listen to <a href=""https://player.fm/series/mtb-tribe-your-trail-m...%C2%A0or"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://player.fm/series/mtb-tribe-your-trail-m...</a> look at rwandaenduro.com). This race is important to me because I would like to see mountain biking thrive in Rwanda and keep creating new opportunities for people in the communities we work with to improve their trails while putting on show. Helping me will;</p>
<p>-Enable me to hire more local people to come out and work on their own footpaths in the hills,</p>
<p>-Bring people to see the beauty of Rwanda</p>
<p>-Make it enjoyable for every rider that comes to ride the land of a thousand hills.</p>
<h3><strong>What we need &amp; What you get </strong></h3>
<p>For this campaign and my dreams of making Rwanda Enduro successful and impactful for a second edition, I aim to raise 10,00 dollars. Your generous funding will go towards the start up cost of the event which includes travel to Rwanda, mean of transportation, lodging, food, marketing, and trail building which is done by local Rwandans (alongside trail experts that have volunteered to help from South Africa and Canada). </p>
<h3><strong>Our perks to supporters:</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p> You will get some Rwanda Enduro swag (t shirts, hats, stickers, etc.) and have a trail named after you or an organization you'd like to promote. If I don't reach the campaign goal the funds will still forsure go towards trails maintenance, and my trip to Rwanda to make this race happen.  </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>This project is an impact not only to the mountain biking community, but to Rwanda and East Africa. I am working on getting Rwanda Enduro listed as a qualifier for the Enduro World Series (EWS). This will bring more people who love nature and the outdoors to mountain bike in Rwanda, and will of course make Rwandans lives' who work with us much better with the employment I will be continuing to provide. </p>
<p>The last Rwanda Enduro race brought 15 racers from 12 different nationalities and created a new trails network in Rwanda. With your help we will be bring many smiles to the kids who will love the excitement, to the adults who will finally find work, and to the community of mountain bikers. Since I Rwanda Enduro established others have tried to re make the event. New mountain bike events have risen around Rwanda. I am happy this was a direct impact from Rwanda Enduro.  </p>
<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>While I was working on the race for 2019 and 2020, I faced financial obstacles, unexpected delays in paper work, and not having enough helpers. Of course with Covid 19 in 2020 I had to cancel the event. I am ensuring that I will do everything within my control that this will not be the same for 2021. I would like you all the donors to know what their money does and the risks involved. With the experience I have had the past two years, I am now more prepared to go back and have a smooth set up for 2021 and the years to follow. I have reached out to many other organizers for any advice or tips to make this event happen as evenly possible. I am committed and have the support structure ready to face them!</p>

Comments? Check the FAQ page or ask us: sales@andeanblue.comShipping November 2020 Andean Accents merge culture and modern life. Our daypack allows you to make a bold statement and adventure simultaneously. Unique accents - Unique memories.A place for everythingOn top of being functional, beautifully bold and unique, the rich colors of the Andean textiles make it easier to spot you if you get lost in the forest or the snow. Other features include:- An internal pocket for your hydration system (water bladder) with a hole for the hose.- A front pocket for your keys, wallet, etc.- A whistle on the buckle of the chest, - A low front pocket for easy access to snacks, power bars, etc.- A stash pocket on each side. These pockets fit most water bottles.- Compression straps to make sure the weight is balanced.- An external frame that keeps the backpack off your back, allowing it to breathe and placing the weight on your shoulders and waist.- The frame is removable!- Small pockets on each side of the waist strap. - A hidden lower pocket with a rain cover! The backpack is water resistant but we want to make sure your belongings stay dry.The prototypeThis 20L backpack is very sturdy and can be used in a variety of situations. You can use it for day hikes (It has a pocket for your hydration system), when traveling or even just day-to-day. And it is not only of great quality, it is enhanced with Andean textiles, which are colorful, bold, and resilient — representative of the Andean culture.The backpack that we are featuring is the original prototype. The final product will have our logo and will look more like this:With three options for the accents: Trendy without tryingMade for the outdoorsy, the explorers, the trailblazers. Made for you. Because you are so used to have other people follow in your footsteps... It's personalGrowing up in Peru, I have always found Andean culture fascinating: Adapting and surviving in the midst of challenges. These expressions appeared everywhere in small accessories, textiles, jacket patches or completely unique products like the intricate design on chocolate bar packaging - descriptively Andean and handmade.We want to bring this rich Andean life, culture and history to the forefront of hiking and outdoor activities with our textile accents. Andean BlueOne of the questions we are asked often is about our logo. In the Andean cosmovision, the universe is mostly divided in three realms (named in Quechua here, for simplicity): The Hananpacha or sky/heaven, represented by the Kuntur (condor), the Kaypacha or earth/ground, represented by the Atuq (fox) and the Hurinpacha or underground, represented by the Amaru or machukuay (serpent). Since we consider ourselves explorers of the outdoors, we felt identified with the wandering Atuq (fox).The style of our logo was inspired by the iconography of different Andean cultures.  The campaignWe are preselling our first batch of 500 backpacks as a way to launch Andean Blue. The backpacks are not only very high quality and practical, but they stand out (in a great way). You’ll always know which backpack is yours and, since you can’t buy them anywhere else, people will always be asking you “Where did you get that backpack? It’s so unique”. Ready to try one out? Buy one now and support us. Through these backpacks, we’re helping keep Andean culture alive in a unique and accessible way. Whether you’re an avid hiker or a newbie, or just want something more stylish, our backpacks are for you. Interested but not your thing?You can always help us by sharing this campaign and telling your friends, coworkers and random strangers about us!Looking for more information? Check the project FAQ",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Gnarlcraft- </h3>
<p>My name is Jacob Stiller and my Company is Gnarlcraft Board Co.  We are a small company that is under a year out.  We build beautiful pieces of art that also preserve a form and function. Our boards are built from locally sourced materials that are in majority upcycled.  Our focus is to influence the local community to have passion for outdoor board sports and to build a stronger connection with the outdoors. We want to grow and help others grow while perpetuating passion for doing the things we love.  Our campaign is to raise money to help our company grow so we can get snowboards and longboards from our local community into more individuals hands! We want everyone to have a beautiful piece of art that they can use when going out and adventuring. We are hoping to raise enough money to get a pneumatic press in order to speed up our building process being all of our boards are hand built. This also will increase the quality of your boards and allow us to grow in skill with the building process.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to raise $4000 in order to invest into a pneumatic press for our company. This money will directly impact our local community in a couple of ways. This will allow us to continue producing boards of the highest quality but also will be able to do it in a more timely fashion. That being said, we can produce more boards and with the overstock we can then start to donate longboards and snowboards to local community member to build the sport. We want to build our community by giving back.  Our end goal is to spread the love by driving passion and getting everyone excited about what they are passionate about.</li>
<li>If we raise our entire goal we will be hosting a few events and will be giving away prizes at the events that will range from goggles, hats and sherpa hoodies to a custom snowboard. If we raise more than our goal we will be starting a shop space/learning space where we will be hosting classes on how to build your own board!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>• Our local snow and skate community has been shrinking over the years. With the influence of a local company we hope to build this community back up and build the passion of creating beautiful things with our hands.  Board building is a long lost art that can be every rider knowledge.  These sports are fun sports that everyone can do and can connect individuals with the nature that surrounds them!</p>

We are on a mission to pick only ONE hostel per city and cover the whole WORLD. Why only one hostel? It's pretty simple, because it's THE best. The only thing you need it's your PATCH and a great mindset that you are going to have a GREAT and AWESOME trip.

<p>CityScout enables you connect with locals based on things you are looking to do, and do it with them. No one wants to see the same old tourist traps.

<p>Would you rather work in a humid office mid-July? Spend your day seeking unavailable spots on a Mediterranean beach? Or look for the remaining unpaved roads within the Stan region, driving an old crappy car, and for a good cause? Well, as far as we re concerned, we went with option 3 and decided to embark on this insane/crazy/scary, however you want to call it, adventure. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1416879/files/20150426151053-ulan_ude.png?1430086253"" src="""" style=""width: 571.44px; height: 189px;""/></p>

<p><b>We</b> will be driving from Prague all the way to Ulan Ude, Siberia, crossing the borders of most Stan countries, Iran, Mongolia and Russia while teasing both Afghanistan's and Syria's borders. That implies crossing deserts, mountain chains, passing by historical soviet sites, temples and markets recalling the greatness of the silk road. But we do not want to keep that for ourselves.</p>
<p><b>You</b> too will be able to follow and share those moments with us thanks to our onboard cameras, blogs and many other surprises.. This will hopefully help us justify the irrationality of our adventure if we can't put it up into words right now. And its quite simple: Hoping to make our life more entertaining and make the world a better place! But before we elaborate on that here is a short description of our team:</p>
<h3> The Team</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 guys </li>
<li>From Switzerland although living between London and Montreal</li>
<li>Trying to stay in touch and organise that rally through short Skypes that get us even more confused</li>
<li>However, most importantly, we're just a bunch of passionated yet maybe temerarious travellers willing to reach new horizons by using our past experiences to help us overcome our undeniable lack of technical capabilities to handle cars.</li>

<div>!!THANK YOU!!</div>
</div></div>","Mongol what?


Would you rather work in a humid office mid-July? Spend your day seeking unavailable spots on a Mediterranean beach? Or look for the remaining unpaved roads within the Stan region, driving an old crappy car, and for a good cause? Well, as far as we re concerned, we went with option 3 and decided to embark on this insane/crazy/scary, however you want to call it, adventure. 




We will be driving from Prague all the way to Ulan Ude, Siberia, crossing the borders of most Stan countries, Iran, Mongolia and Russia while teasing both Afghanistan's and Syria's borders. That implies crossing deserts, mountain chains, passing by historical soviet sites, temples and markets recalling the greatness of the silk road. But we do not want to keep that for ourselves.
You too will be able to follow and share those moments with us thanks to our onboard cameras, blogs and many other surprises.. This will hopefully help us justify the irrationality of our adventure if we can't put it up into words right now. And its quite simple: Hoping to make our life more entertaining and make the world a better place! But before we elaborate on that here is a short description of our team:
 The Team

4 guys 
From Switzerland although living between London and Montreal
Trying to stay in touch and organise that rally through short Skypes that get us even more confused
However, most importantly, we're just a bunch of passionated yet maybe temerarious travellers willing to reach new horizons by using our past experiences to help us overcome our undeniable lack of technical capabilities to handle cars.





Lucas                          Mana                        Elliott                             Vlad
 Lucas : 
+ Our men meant to entertain us during those long and difficult hours jammed in the traffic of Tehran.           
- Will however force us to drive extra hours as we do NOT trust him behind a car wheel.                                                                                              


Mana: 
+ His communication skills will probably help us save a lot of money on bribing           
- Will worsen our already though nights of sleep due to his pathological snoring                                                                                                                                        


Elliott:

 - Will probably break everything we will ask him to hold

- Will probably let us die starving if we do not keep our food storage's location secret


We need you to have a greater impact

 As we said earlier, we want to help the world and will achieve doing so under two different ways: Fund a reforestation program in the Amazon with a NGO, named CoolEarth, likewise seeking to reinsert displaced tribes and develop local economies.
Additionally, we will help financially a Geneva-based NGO, LetItBeat, which aims to provide training to foreign doctors to undertake heart operations for children that fled unstable areas within the Middle-Eastern region.
Considering the situation in Nepal, we have decided to donate one third of raised funds to P.I.E.C.E.S.P.I.E.C.E.S is an entirely student run organisation of the University of St Gallen working in the field of education in less privileged areas of this world. They have projects in Asia and South and Central America in partnership with public schools and send their highly qualified volunteer teams to teach there for a longer period of time twice a year. 





         

                   
                      



15'000 USD is our goal

By helping us to raise such an exceptional amount of money, you would help us reinforce local communities in South America as well as provide unique medical cares to kids living in ongoing tougher living conditions.  If you want further details on how we will/can help them, go on their websites.

<h3>Changing Scuba for the better</h3>
<p>Scuba diving is fascinating yet an extreme sport. You are drawn into a rich and beautiful experience in another world but there are many risks and hazards lurking. Situations can get out of hand very quickly and divers can get trapped, getting injured and sometimes ending up in a fatality.</p>
<p>Diveline will create an underwater wireless (using sound) network where divers can send messages to each other and the surface. Diveline will have a navigation function where you can locate (distance and direction) your separated dive buddy, the boat or a lost diver. The distance for both communication (field tested) and navigation is 2km. Find your way and stay connected with Diveline.</p>

</h3>
<h3>Why are we crowd funding?</h3>
<p>The main reason for this campaign is to raise sufficient funds to complete the prototype within four months, ready for testing by scuba divers. The second important reason is to get the community involved with the development of this product. As this is a personal device the community is an important contributor to the final form of the product. We want to put a product into the hands of Scuba divers that they helped shape and create from an early stage of the development.</p>
<h3>How will we utilize the funds</h3>
<p>We will use the funds to finish the prototype. Currently we have completed approximately 80% of the prototype. We are at the stage of integrating and testing all the parts that make up the system. This includes firmware, hardware as well as completing the injection molds for pressure casing.</p>
<p>The other areas that we will apply the funds are setting up a customer support team, packaging, marketing material, type approval certification.</p>
<h3>Our challenges</h3>
<p>While we are confident that the core technology will work we have still got a lot of testing and validation to carry out with real divers. The next biggest challenge is setting up marketing and support networks globally.</p>
<h3>Make diving safer</h3>
<p>Diveline can revolutionize scuba diving. Divers can connect with each other and find each other quickly and reliably. Everyday there are reports of diver fatalities and injuries. Many go unreported. Help us bring this product to market that will change a human endeavor for the better. Your contribution is important and valuable.</p>
<p>Even if you cannot support us monetarily please spread the word about Diveline using the share tools on Indiegogo and also your social media. Every small action you make now counts towards returning a future diver home safely!</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>

<li>NavComAdopter: This is the personal unit. This unit will have the display and buttons. You need one for yourself and one for your buddy or boat for a basic set up. You can send messages between yourself and the buddy or other diver/boat. You can find your lost buddy or navigate back to the boat using the NavCom personal unit.</li>
<li>BeaconAdopter: This is the beacon unit that you can use to mark an object, location or boat. The beacon unit does not have a display and will have a fixed network address. The Navcom or the DiveLineBase can locate and navigate to the beacon unit.</li>

The smart device will run an app to send messages to divers as well as track them. On the Base unit Multiple divers can be tracked. The Base unit will show messages and you can find an individual diver or a Beacon.

The perks we offer in this round of funding are very special and will not be offered again. As an early adopter you get to trial the DiveLine NavCom first and provide helpful feedback. This feedback will be used to shape the final product. You will be making a valuable contribution. For this we offer a hefty 45% discount on RRP and an offer to replace the beta units with the final production units free of charge. You only have to pay for courier/postage costs. To show our appreciations even further for getting on board with us on this exciting journey we are offering a lifetime 20% off on any DiveLine products in the future (with a limit of 10 units per single customer per year for this discount). We will keep your name and address details on record.",9.0,1,"1 Campaign
