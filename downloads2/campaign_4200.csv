<br/><h3>Long Story</h3> <p>My name is Isabella Cruz-Chong. I am an interdisciplinary artist and designer raised in Tijuana, Mexico and based in Brooklyn, NY. I am currently an MFA candidate in the Design and Technology program at Parsons School of Design. <br/><br/>My thesis project, <i><a href=""https://lineofbreath.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Line of Breath</a>,</i> is a sound installation on the Tijuana/San Diego political fence in an attempt to manifest a liminal state and give life to this often neglected in-between. The sound recordings of my breath are physically attached to the metal fence, transforming the fence into one speaker. The installation took place on April 8th and 9th in Tijuana, Mexico. </p>
<p>This past month, the project was selected to be exhibited in June at a great gallery in Brooklyn, NY where the exhibition's theme will be the 2016 US Elections. I am excited that the Tijuana border fence can be shown in this context given its importance to both countries and their communities.  <br/></p>
<p>The project will be exhibited with an 8ft x 8ft free-standing fence made of corrugated metal sheets with puck transducers and custom speakers. This sound installation will also be accompanied by video documentation of the work process and the installation in Tijuana.</p>
<p>The help that I'm asking for will go toward the construction and installation of the fence to ensure it properly represents the Tijuana/San Diego border fence and its effects. <br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> <br/></span></p>

<h3><br/></h3> <p>Spoken Perceptions is an interactive poetry showcase that features five of Savannah's most talented spoken word artists. On May 20th and 21st 8pm at Non-Fiction Gallery, these poets words will be projected onto screens in the gallery space in real time. Motion media designers have created unique animations that spawn with every word spoken. The following is an example of those animations created by one of our designers, Amy Wallace.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F147745228&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F147745228&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F556432808_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>Finally, the audience will be able to interact with those words using  Microsoft Kinect technology. Thus the art of the performer becomes the art of the audience.<br/></p>
<p><i>Where do the poems end up after audience interaction? This is where...</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460423333/Screenshot_112_t5xvx8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Spoken Perceptions is also the M.A. Arts Administration Final Project for its Creative Director and Project Manager, Camille Jenkins. Camille first imagined this interactive performing arts experience in August of 2015. Since then she has worked every day on this project, collaborating with over 20 artists, designers, and poets on her journey to turn this dream into a reality.</p>
<p>However, Spoken Perceptions was created not just for Camille, but for the entire Savannah community and beyond. This project has given a chance for those multitude of designers, artists, and poets to shine. This project strives to create a thought provoking, deeply personal, and yet universal event that asks all of us to contemplate the real impact of the words we say. </p>
<p>In a world where rhetoric flies off the tongue without a care and people sometimes speak before they think (ourselves included), Spoken Perceptions celebrates the belief that words have power and that they truly can take on a life of their own. Thus why not honor and explore that transformative power? Perhaps this exploration will lead to our own personal evolution.</p>

</div></div>","What is Spoken Perceptions?

 Spoken Perceptions is an interactive poetry showcase that features five of Savannah's most talented spoken word artists. On May 20th and 21st 8pm at Non-Fiction Gallery, these poets words will be projected onto screens in the gallery space in real time. Motion media designers have created unique animations that spawn with every word spoken. The following is an example of those animations created by one of our designers, Amy Wallace.

Finally, the audience will be able to interact with those words using  Microsoft Kinect technology. Thus the art of the performer becomes the art of the audience.
Where do the poems end up after audience interaction? This is where...



Spoken Perceptions is also the M.A. Arts Administration Final Project for its Creative Director and Project Manager, Camille Jenkins. Camille first imagined this interactive performing arts experience in August of 2015. Since then she has worked every day on this project, collaborating with over 20 artists, designers, and poets on her journey to turn this dream into a reality.
However, Spoken Perceptions was created not just for Camille, but for the entire Savannah community and beyond. This project has given a chance for those multitude of designers, artists, and poets to shine. This project strives to create a thought provoking, deeply personal, and yet universal event that asks all of us to contemplate the real impact of the words we say. 
In a world where rhetoric flies off the tongue without a care and people sometimes speak before they think (ourselves included), Spoken Perceptions celebrates the belief that words have power and that they truly can take on a life of their own. Thus why not honor and explore that transformative power? Perhaps this exploration will lead to our own personal evolution.

“Words mean more than what is set down on paper. It
takes the human voice to infuse them with shades of deeper meaning.” 
― Maya Angelou, I
Know Why the Caged Bird Sings
“I know nothing in the world that has as much power as
a word. Sometimes I write one, and I look at it, until it begins to shine.” 
― Emily Dickinson   Your Support Turns Dreams into Reality

Spoken Perceptions needs $1,855 to cover all of the expenses mandatory in order to put on an event of this magnitude for our community. Main expenses include:

For those wanting to go deeper into the concept of Spoken Perceptions, I welcome you to read the official show statement:
Beyond definitions, beyond even the words themselves,

</div></div>","THEATER  :  A French American project in DANCE THEATER and video based on Sarah Kane's 4.48 Psychosis .Throughout my career, I have been very blessed to work with directors and choreographers such as Georges Lavaudant, Raimund Hoghe, Yves Beaunesne , Anatoli Vassiliev , Jean- Marie Patte, Frederic Fisbach , Helene Vincent , Christophe Perton , Robert Moses Kin , Benoit Jacquot , Frederic Berthes , Moise Toure ...   Those creations  allowed me  also to travel to multiple places around the world such as India, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, USA (San Francisco, Boston, New York, Los Angeles...I also directed Othello by Shakespeare , Three sisters by Tchekov , The lover by Marguerite Duras , Phedre in India by Jean Christophe Bailly .



Being  granted the ""Villa Medicis"" allowed me to focus more on dance . I created a  dance theatre piece : “Life or
Theater” after Charlotte Salomon ’s paintings. (performed at ODC Theater in San Francisco
and at MAHJ in Paris ). 4:48 is in direct continuation with ""Life or Theatre"". This time I am focusing on how the body is able to translate, through dance and words, the trouble of the mind.
En parralèle à une carrière de comédienne avec des metteurs
en scène tels que Georges Lavaudant, Raimund
Hogue, Yves Beaunesne, Anatoli Vassiliev, Jean Marie Patte,
Frederic Fischbach, Helène Vincent, Christophe Perton,
Benoît Jacquot, Federic Berthes, Moïse Touré... mon
exploration de la danse s’est poursuivie avec Peter Goss,
Mary Carbonara, Wayne Mc Greggor, Alonzo King. Celle-ci m’a
encouragée à rechercher la sensation de liberté et d’émotion
brute qui s’exprime dans le language du corps. J’ai aussi mis en scène “les trois soeurs” de Tchekov,
“L’Amant” de Marguerite Duras, Phèdre en Inde” de Jean
Christophe Bailly, Par mon travail j'ai pu voyager de part le
monde, en Inde, France, Espagne, Italie, Allemagne, USA.



EN 2014 j'ai reçu  la Villa Medicis   hors les murs et me suis installée à San Francisco pour developper un spectacle en danse theâtre d'après l'oeuvre de Charlotte Salomon ""Life or Theatre"", joué à ODC Theatre, San Francisco et présenté au MAJH, Paris.  ""Black and white 448 psychosis"" est le second volet de 'Life or Theater ' , Ce projet mêle  le mouvement , le texte et la video . 

www.astridbas.com 










 What arouses my creativity is to mix dance and theatre in the
same pieces. In parallel to this, mixing in plastic arts,
paint, sound and video projection has enabled me to fully
satisfy my need to express emotion. Sarah
Kane's writing in ""Psychosis 4.48"" allows movement and open
interpretation to body language.

















« Psychosis 4.48 » est le second volet de mon travail basé
sur «Life or Theatre ». Cette fois je me concentre sur la
manière dont le corps humain peut traduire les troubles de la
pensée à travers la danse et les mots.
Ma créativité nait dans le lien de la danse et des mots. Y
mêler les arts plastiques, la peinture, le son et la projection
video me permet de pleinement satisfaire l’expression de mon
émotion. L’écriture même de « 448 Black and white psychosis""  permet
le mouvement et l’interprétation du corps. 







Freedom and feminine figures are two focuses that entice my creative flow. Women who want
to rebel  and speak against violence and captivity is an act  that inspired me into this creation . 














In 1999 the author committed suicide. She wanted to speak about the world around her . She was quite
young, the same age as Charlotte Salomon who spoke
through her paintings. I am creating a sense of confinement but the piece is about memory and hope.







On November 4th we showed 30mn of the piece at Gibney Art center in NY. Your help will allow us to  finish the piece and open a window on the fragility of the human being . And I hope light in the darkness . Why I named it  
""Black and white psychosis"" .

<p><b>Reclaim Your City.<i> </i></b>Der Ausverkauf der Innenstädte, die Verdrängung von Sub- und Kiezkultur und damit verbunden ein Grundgefühl des Verlusts sind ein weltweites Phänomen. Das Bild vieler Großstädte ist heute geprägt von seelenloser Architektur, Konformität  und steigenden Mieten<i>. Vanishing Berlin</i> dokumentiert Orte, an die wir uns mit Wehmut erinnern werden, obwohl wir nicht einmal ahnten, dass wir sie jemals vermissen würden. Das Buch markiert für mich den Ausgangspunkt für die weitere Auseinandersetzung mit den aktuellen Entwicklungen des städtischen Raums.</p>

<p><b>Nichts Hält Ewig.</b> Viele der Fotos vermitteln den Eindruck, als seien sie bereits vor Jahrzehnten aufgenommen worden. Tatsächlich sind alle Bilder im Zeitraum zwischen 2009 und 2016 entstanden. Mein Interesse gilt dem zeitgenössischen Blick. Nicht die Abbildung der Vergangenheit steht im Fokus, sondern der Prozess der Veränderung. Dem Betrachter stellt sich bei jedem Bild die Frage: Gibt es dieses Motiv noch oder ist es schon verschwunden? </p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>„Das Neue an den Fotos ist, dass die Bilder durchreisen, „in transition“ sind. Als wäre die Stadt eine Karte, die man einmal liest und dann wegwirft, weil man sie ohnehin nicht vergisst, ob man will oder nicht. Obwohl Vanishing Berlin aus Bruchstücken untergegangener Zeiten besteht, die uns zuzwinkern, die scherzen und grummeln, als wäre es das erste Mal, entsteht ein Bild von einer Stadt, die sich selbst aufgebraucht hat (...).

<span style=""font-style: italic;background-color: initial;""><i><b>Schöneberger Serengeti </b></i></span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Die Nachmittage verbrachte ich oft mit Erkundungstouren auf meinem Bonanza-Fahrrad. Das Einzugsgebiet reichte vom Winterfeldtplatz, von den Straßenkämpfen damals oft in Rauch und Tränengas gehüllt, über den Christiane F. Babystrich in der Einemstraße bis zum Freigelände am Lützowplatz. Vom Hotel Berlin bis zur Kreuzung Tiergartenstraße erstreckte sich eine riesige Brache, bewachsen mit hohem Gestrüpp, übersäht mit Glasscherben und benutzten Kondomen. Inmitten dieser urbanen Steppe, von der aus man einen schönen Blick auf die Skyline der West-City hatte, stand nur ein einziges Haus, die Taverne. Eine große, karge Baracke, in der zwielichtige Pils-Trinker in Fransenlederjacken Westernabende oder Skatturniere abhielten. Auf dieser Brache wurde mit dem „Frühlingsfest“ alljährlich die Berliner Rummelsaison eröffnet. Jahrzehnte später markieren postmoderne Botschaftsgebäude und die CDU-Parteizentrale hier das Gelände.</i>

<p><b>Point and shoot. </b><i>Vanishing Berlin</i> provides a very personal perspective on the city in which I was born and raised. Being a passionate flâneur and observer, I have been photographing transient landmarks all over Berlin for many years, focusing mainly on wastelands, storefronts and brick walls. These places characterise Berlin, but equally they are vanishing at an unprecedented pace. </p>
<p>Thanks to the kind support of +220 backers, I was able to publish a first edition of<i> Vanishing Berlin</i>, an extraordinary, professionally-designed photo book (release date : End of September 2016). Meanwhile there is a second edition available (ISBN: 978-3000560408) I want to continue and enlarge the Vanishing Berlin project in the near future. For that I appreciate any further support.<br/><br/>The easiest way to order a copy of the book or Vansihing Berlin Art is to use this Indemand website on Indiegogo.

<p><b>Nothing lasts forever.</b> Many of the photos look as if they were taken decades ago. In fact, all the images were captured between 2009 and 2016. I am interested in the contemporary; it is not the depiction of the past that I wish focus on, but the process of change. For the viewers each picture should raise the question: Does this place still exist or has it already vanished?</p>
<blockquote>
<i>“What is new about the photos is that these images are passing through, they are “in transition”, as if the city is a map to be studied and tossed aside, because we know we will never forget it anyway – whether we want to or not. Though Vanishing Berlin is made of fragments of a dying past that flirt, joke or mumble to us, as if engaging with us for the first time, the picture that arises is one of a city that has been consumed by itself (…). At times yet another Berlin comes into view, images that conjure up memories of a kind of demi-monde, a desolate landscape in which anyone could end up at any time (…)” </i>From the afterword to <i>Vanishing Berlin </i>by Friedhelm Böpple.</blockquote>

<b>Reclaim your memory</b>. The photos are accompanied by anecdotes from my early childhood and youth as well as by brief notes on the current state of the city, creating a montage of images and words. <i>Vanishing Berlin</i> invites the readers to journey into their own past.<blockquote>
<b>The Serengeti of Schöneberg</b>.  I often spent the afternoon exploring the neighbourhoods on my High Riser. My cruising radius stretched from Winterfeldtplatz, which at the time was often engulfed in smoke and tear gas from street fights, to Christiane F’s teenage streetwalker patch in Einemstraße, to the open area at Lützowplatz. An enormous wasteland, covered with high scrub, pieces of broken glass and used condoms, which stretched from the Hotel Berlin to the junction with Tiergartenstraße. Amidst this urban scrubland, which overlooked the skyline of the city’s west, there was only one single building. The Tavern was a big, bleak barrack in which dodgy beer drinkers in fringed leather jackets came together for Country &amp; Western evenings and skat tournaments. In July of every year this wasteland hosted the Spring Festival, kicking off the annual Berlin funfair season. Decades later, postmodern embassy buildings and the headquarters of the German conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) mark the landscape.</blockquote>

Seit jeher ein passionierter Flaneur und Beobachter, dokumentiere ich seit vielen Jahren flüchtige Sehenswürdigkeiten, quer durch alle Bezirke. Vor allem Brachen, Ladenfronten und Brandmauern. Orte, die Berlin charakterisieren und die gleichzeitig in rasantem Tempo aus dem Stadtbild verschwinden. Dank des Vertrauens von +220 Unterstützern konnte ich ein außergewöhnliches, professionell gestaltetes Fotobuch produzieren. Erscheinungstermin der Erstauflage Ende September 2016, inzwischen ist eine zweite Auflage des Titels erhältlich (ISBN: 978-3000560408). Ich möchte das Vanishing Berlin Projekt auch in Zukunft fortführen und weiterentwickeln und freue mich weiterhin über jede Unterstützung.Die schnellste und unkomplizierteste Möglichkeit Vanishing Berlin Art zu bestellen, ist diese ""In demand"" Kampagne bei Indiegogo - einfach entsprechenden ""Perk"" auswählen. Ihr könnt mir aber gerne auch eine e-mail schicken (alexsteffen@berlin.de) und Eure Bestellung per Banküberweisung bezahlen. Das Buch gibt es inzwischen auch bei Amazon. Für diejenigen, die das Buch erst sehen wollen, gibt es eine Liste mit Buchhandlungen und Concept-Stores meines Vertrauens.

Reclaim Your City. Der Ausverkauf der Innenstädte, die Verdrängung von Sub- und Kiezkultur und damit verbunden ein Grundgefühl des Verlusts sind ein weltweites Phänomen. Das Bild vieler Großstädte ist heute geprägt von seelenloser Architektur, Konformität  und steigenden Mieten. Vanishing Berlin dokumentiert Orte, an die wir uns mit Wehmut erinnern werden, obwohl wir nicht einmal ahnten, dass wir sie jemals vermissen würden. Das Buch markiert für mich den Ausgangspunkt für die weitere Auseinandersetzung mit den aktuellen Entwicklungen des städtischen Raums.

Nichts Hält Ewig. Viele der Fotos vermitteln den Eindruck, als seien sie bereits vor Jahrzehnten aufgenommen worden. Tatsächlich sind alle Bilder im Zeitraum zwischen 2009 und 2016 entstanden. Mein Interesse gilt dem zeitgenössischen Blick. Nicht die Abbildung der Vergangenheit steht im Fokus, sondern der Prozess der Veränderung. Dem Betrachter stellt sich bei jedem Bild die Frage: Gibt es dieses Motiv noch oder ist es schon verschwunden? 

„Das Neue an den Fotos ist, dass die Bilder durchreisen, „in transition“ sind. Als wäre die Stadt eine Karte, die man einmal liest und dann wegwirft, weil man sie ohnehin nicht vergisst, ob man will oder nicht. Obwohl Vanishing Berlin aus Bruchstücken untergegangener Zeiten besteht, die uns zuzwinkern, die scherzen und grummeln, als wäre es das erste Mal, entsteht ein Bild von einer Stadt, die sich selbst aufgebraucht hat (...). Manchmal wird auch ein anderes Berlin sichtbar, rufen die Bilder eine Erinnerung an eine Art Halbwelt wach, eine verwüstete Landschaft, in der jeder jederzeit landen könnte. (...)"" Friedhelm Böpple im Nachwort zu Vanishing Berlin

Die Fotos im Buch sind mit anekdotischen Erinnerungen aus meiner Kindheit und Jugend sowie kurzen Notizen zum Zustand der Stadt montiert. Vanishing Berlin lädt den Leser damit auf eine Reise in die eigene Vergangenheit ein.

Schöneberger Serengeti Die Nachmittage verbrachte ich oft mit Erkundungstouren auf meinem Bonanza-Fahrrad. Das Einzugsgebiet reichte vom Winterfeldtplatz, von den Straßenkämpfen damals oft in Rauch und Tränengas gehüllt, über den Christiane F. Babystrich in der Einemstraße bis zum Freigelände am Lützowplatz. Vom Hotel Berlin bis zur Kreuzung Tiergartenstraße erstreckte sich eine riesige Brache, bewachsen mit hohem Gestrüpp, übersäht mit Glasscherben und benutzten Kondomen. Inmitten dieser urbanen Steppe, von der aus man einen schönen Blick auf die Skyline der West-City hatte, stand nur ein einziges Haus, die Taverne. Eine große, karge Baracke, in der zwielichtige Pils-Trinker in Fransenlederjacken Westernabende oder Skatturniere abhielten. Auf dieser Brache wurde mit dem „Frühlingsfest“ alljährlich die Berliner Rummelsaison eröffnet. Jahrzehnte später markieren postmoderne Botschaftsgebäude und die CDU-Parteizentrale hier das Gelände.

Nothing is true, everything is permitted. Warum das Ganze und warum jetzt? Nach jahrelanger intensiver Beschäftigung mit dem Projekt war es mir wichtig, mit dem Vanishing Berlin jetzt an die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen – bevor die totale Besetzung mit Gegenwart die Motive in Geschichte verwandelt. Hier eine Auswahl von Links zur Berichterstattung über das Vanishing Berlin Projekt:

English Version 

 
Point and shoot. Vanishing Berlin provides a very personal perspective on the city in which I was born and raised. Being a passionate flâneur and observer, I have been photographing transient landmarks all over Berlin for many years, focusing mainly on wastelands, storefronts and brick walls. These places characterise Berlin, but equally they are vanishing at an unprecedented pace. 
Thanks to the kind support of +220 backers, I was able to publish a first edition of Vanishing Berlin, an extraordinary, professionally-designed photo book (release date : End of September 2016). Meanwhile there is a second edition available (ISBN: 978-3000560408) I want to continue and enlarge the Vanishing Berlin project in the near future. For that I appreciate any further support.The easiest way to order a copy of the book or Vansihing Berlin Art is to use this Indemand website on Indiegogo. Simply choose your favourite ""Perk"" and pay via creditcard or Paypal. If you like you can order also via e-mail (alexsteffen@berlin.de) and use banktranfer. You can also order the book via Amazon. For those of you who want to touch and feel the book first,  here is a list of bookstores and shops of my choice. If you want to distribute the book, just let me know. For resellers I am happy to offer commercial conditions.
 
Linoleum Pannier. Kreuzberg, 2016
Reclaim your city. City centres being sold out, underground scenes and neighbourhood identities being displaced, the associated underlying feelings of loss; all these are worldwide phenomena. Today the faces of many cities are characterised by soulless architecture, conformity and surging rents. Vanishing Berlin captures the places that we will remember wistfully, though we did not think we would ever miss them.
 
Rütli-Brache. Neukölln, 2015
Nothing lasts forever. Many of the photos look as if they were taken decades ago. In fact, all the images were captured between 2009 and 2016. I am interested in the contemporary; it is not the depiction of the past that I wish focus on, but the process of change. For the viewers each picture should raise the question: Does this place still exist or has it already vanished?

“What is new about the photos is that these images are passing through, they are “in transition”, as if the city is a map to be studied and tossed aside, because we know we will never forget it anyway – whether we want to or not. Though Vanishing Berlin is made of fragments of a dying past that flirt, joke or mumble to us, as if engaging with us for the first time, the picture that arises is one of a city that has been consumed by itself (…). At times yet another Berlin comes into view, images that conjure up memories of a kind of demi-monde, a desolate landscape in which anyone could end up at any time (…)” From the afterword to Vanishing Berlin by Friedhelm Böpple.
 
Yorckbrücken. Kreuzberg, 2014
Reclaim your memory. The photos are accompanied by anecdotes from my early childhood and youth as well as by brief notes on the current state of the city, creating a montage of images and words. Vanishing Berlin invites the readers to journey into their own past.
The Serengeti of Schöneberg.  I often spent the afternoon exploring the neighbourhoods on my High Riser. My cruising radius stretched from Winterfeldtplatz, which at the time was often engulfed in smoke and tear gas from street fights, to Christiane F’s teenage streetwalker patch in Einemstraße, to the open area at Lützowplatz. An enormous wasteland, covered with high scrub, pieces of broken glass and used condoms, which stretched from the Hotel Berlin to the junction with Tiergartenstraße. Amidst this urban scrubland, which overlooked the skyline of the city’s west, there was only one single building. The Tavern was a big, bleak barrack in which dodgy beer drinkers in fringed leather jackets came together for Country & Western evenings and skat tournaments. In July of every year this wasteland hosted the Spring Festival, kicking off the annual Berlin funfair season. Decades later, postmodern embassy buildings and the headquarters of the German conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) mark the landscape.
 
Sexothek Kino. Neukölln, 2014
Nothing is true; everything is permitted. What is the point anyway and why now? After years of intensive engagement with this project it is time to take Vanishing Berlin into the public eye – before these spaces become totally occupied by the present and are turned into history. 
The book is not an isolated project. Further exhibitions and editions, as well as both text- and video-based works are already in the pipeline. Creating a dialogue and exchanging ideas with like-minded artists, photographers, and authors will continue to be an important part of my work, and I have already taken the first steps to ensure this project is brought to the international stage.
Who is the target group of Vanishing Berlin? The book is for all Berlin lovers. For natives, newcomers and tourists. For booklovers, for photography and art freaks. For historians, melancholics and urban developers. For beatniks, hipsters and flâneurs. For victims and perpetrators of gentrification. In Berlin and elsewhere.
Why should I support Vanishing Berlin? Out of a love for Berlin and its inhabitants. Out of a passion for authentic and unconventional photography. Out of a desire to sense the vestiges of history. And last but not least for the extraordinary perks. 
Where does your money go? Your money will be used exclusively for furher Vanishing Berlin projects.

Since its beginning as a powerful voice of the Egyptian revolution,
graffiti and street art have mainly appeared
on city walls. “New Walls” is a public arts project in which
Egyptian artists will meet international muralists to paint the homes
of the village of Tunis in Al Fayoum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Egyptian
street artists are now faced with politically polarized streets, and
our project offers them an alternative canvas to explore.  It's
chance to re-energize and refresh the street art scene in Egypt and
to explore street art themes beyond the political.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446303192/hi3n9xrhdmbh3fg6vvxe.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
</p><p>
The
""New Walls"" project in the village of Tunis - famous for
its pottery, natural sights, and beautiful houses - is an experiment
to transform an Egyptian village into an open-air street art museum.
It is the perfect place for such a project as it is home to many
artists and a vibrant community of craftsmen and women.</p>
<p>
In
the period of
22-28 November 2015 (one week before the annual Tunis pottery
festival), we will realize our project. The participating
artists
will have the chance to visit the village, discover its walls, and
make connections with the locals.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446303248/ixan6sginyfkxmrk8g1c.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446509029/uny5ecoegth4qqgjitmw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Egypt</b></p><p>- <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ammar.bakr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ammar Abo Bakr</a>             - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ArtsTrip"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Art Trip</a>                                    - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/beautyqueenofazarita"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aya Tarek</a></p><p>- <a href=""https://www.behance.net/Ennajjar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Israa El-Naggar</a>                - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mhmdelmoshir"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">El Moshir </a>                                 - <a href=""http://themozza.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">El Mozza</a></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">- </span><a href=""http://elteneen.github.io/web/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">El Teneen  </a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">                         - </span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.527142384042640.1073741834.517783631645182&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Maghraffiti + Emmy</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">             - </span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/kta2eb.monalisa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Mona Lisa Brigades</a></p><p>- <a href=""http://egynemo.blogspot.com.eg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nemo</a>                                  - <a href=""https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/el-zeft"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zeft</a></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Spain</b>                                     - <a href=""http://gonzaloborondo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gonzalo Borondo  </a>                 - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BTOY-131023090241290/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BTOY</a></p><p><b>Tunis/France                  </b>- <a href=""http://sunra.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sunra</a>                                         - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/elseed.art"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">El Seed</a> (unconfirmed) </p><p><b>Lebanon  </b>                             - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ali.rafei"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ali Rafei </a></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446303215/grzhcqm8q1ms4mbnxun5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The idea is to exchange knowledge with other artists from Egypt and in the regional street art scene.

</div></div>","Since its beginning as a powerful voice of the Egyptian revolution,
graffiti and street art have mainly appeared
on city walls. “New Walls” is a public arts project in which
Egyptian artists will meet international muralists to paint the homes
of the village of Tunis in Al Fayoum.


Egyptian
street artists are now faced with politically polarized streets, and
our project offers them an alternative canvas to explore.  It's
chance to re-energize and refresh the street art scene in Egypt and
to explore street art themes beyond the political.

The
""New Walls"" project in the village of Tunis - famous for
its pottery, natural sights, and beautiful houses - is an experiment
to transform an Egyptian village into an open-air street art museum.
It is the perfect place for such a project as it is home to many
artists and a vibrant community of craftsmen and women.

In
the period of
22-28 November 2015 (one week before the annual Tunis pottery
festival), we will realize our project. The participating
artists
will have the chance to visit the village, discover its walls, and
make connections with the locals.Egypt- Ammar Abo Bakr             - Art Trip                                    - Aya Tarek- Israa El-Naggar                - El Moshir                                  - El Mozza- El Teneen                           - Maghraffiti + Emmy             - Mona Lisa Brigades- Nemo                                  - ZeftSpain                                     - Gonzalo Borondo                   - BTOYTunis/France                  - Sunra                                         - El Seed (unconfirmed) Lebanon                               - Ali Rafei The idea is to exchange knowledge with other artists from Egypt and in the regional street art scene. The meeting of the group of artists will help them explore and share concepts, techniques, and applications.Since many Egyptian street artists have been away from the streets for sometime now, this is also a clear invitation for them to come together in a new setting and face new open walls.New Walls is a pilot project so documentation of the process and the outcome is very important to us. We will constantly post updates throughout social media, and we will film the process of transforming Tunis wall by wall. This material will help anyone who plans to put together a similar project in the future to learn from what worked for us and to avoid our mistakes.

<p>Launched: September 7, 2020</p>
<p>Black women and women of color, rarely get the support they need in the start-up world to thrive. Especially in light of the turbulent social climate that exists today, we need to highlight underrepresented voices more than ever.</p>
<p>NAL Media is an online networking platform for underrepresented artists to connect and gain access to mentorship.

<p><strong>THE ARTIST</strong></p>
<p>Nicki is an artist living in Columbus, Ohio, where she tells the stories of place and transformation through  sculpture, installation, and performance.  She loves that her art is not only for herself, but it is also influenced and connected to the community where she lives and works. Although currently entrenched in Ohio, she has exhibited her artwork across the US and has been featured in many online and physical publications. She recently won a spot to exhibit artwork in the Springfield Museum of Art in Springfield, Ohio. She needs your help creating <i>Packed</i>; her newest large scale installation, which will debut at the Museum on October 5th, 2019. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562297015/hq5tff3trttymy7hh2hx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p><i>Packed</i> is crafted from 150 laser cut cardboard homes which directly reference a real-world pocket of a neighborhood very close to where she lives, just outside Columbus, Ohio. The individual cardboard homes, each roughly measuring 12 inches x 12 inches, will be piled on top of each other within the Museum to create an expansive landscape of  tumbled architecture. Most of the homes will remain unadorned and dark inside, contrasting with a select few that will have lighting installed within. Those sparsely spaced homes will be perched throughout the mountainous piles, guiding viewers through the installation like small, hopeful beacons leading the way. Conveying the duality of this curious, beautiful, engineered neighborhood. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562296926/mnyjdcqmvomcqpcklqrs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>Nicki is an artist invested in creating artwork with her own two hands, but in order to produce this project in the time allotted, she decided that laser cutting her cardboard would be most efficient. Turns out, laser cutting is EXPENSIVE.  But, determined to bring her project to life, and not finding any reasonable alternatives, she took a risk, sourced a great local laser cutter and pulled out her Discover card.  Everything is cut, and assembly has already begun, but her Discover bill is stressing her out. Please consider helping Nicki pay off her laser cutting charge, and support her in creating this piece dedicated to the homes we choose to live in, the spaces we occupy, and lives we lead within them. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>DOLLARS AND CENTS</strong><strong>TS</strong></p>
<p>$1200 is all Nicki needs to pay off her laser cutting charge. She is a working artist with a full-time job, but this project is definitely out of budget. Her already stressed finances cannot bear the burden of this debt for long.  By contributing to her campaign, you are allowing her the time and energy to focus on completing her project for the Museum, rather than spending her efforts picking up extra shifts to pay it off. </p>
<p>Every little bit helps! Even if Nicki doesn't raise all $1200, every penny raised will go towards her laser cutting bill regardless. And hey, everything is already laser cut, so there's no chance that the project will fail should it not reach it's goal!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE</strong></p>
<p>Even if you are unable to support her with a financial contribution, please share Nicki's artwork and campaign with your friends and family. Every action you take helps spread the word about her project and grows her audience so she can continue to make art for herself and for the community.  And she can't wait to see you at the Springfield Museum on October 5th for the opening!!</p>

<p>Hello beautiful people,</p>
<br/><p>My name is Yeva Deli. I am an actress and a singer, originally from a beautiful country called Lithuania, but currently based in the UK. I started singing when my mom brought me to a singing lesson at the age of 6 - since that day music leads me in life. </p>
<p><br/>In 2014, I graduated from the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre gaining a BA degree in acting on screen. This gave me knowledge and experience of how to work in front of a camera.<br/><br/>In 2018, I released my first original song called Raabta and made a music video in Iceland to fulfil the song with a beautiful, cinematic story.<br/><br/>Raabta song was played on BBC Wiltshire, Lithuanian National Television and it also won the best music video award at the  Music Festival in Spain. I couldn’t describe how much all of this means to me, as this song was my first! Once again huge thanks to everyone who helped me to realise this!<br/><br/>Today we have a new project with a social theme - “UNDER THE SURFACE”, which will involve an EP that I'm recording together with the founders of a Lithuanian recording studio “Rhyme to Rise” - Nerijaus Ramanauskas (NRJuice) ir Ričardas Mikalauskas (Richard Mika) and a set of music videos for the songs on the EP. The songs on this EP will be centered around different forms of violence and long lasting emotions and psychological states that it can cause. During the writing process, we were thinking of how we could start a discussion and dive deeper into those emotions. Why do we feel them, how do they affect us and are they in our power to control?  Who’s fault is it when a person can’t handle it anymore and becomes cruel to himself or others? These situations can be very complicated.. We decided to create 4 music videos analyzing these moments. Together with a talented director Lakkys Kac, one of the greatest lithuanian actresses Monika Vaičiulyte and a magnificent make up artist Elena Permogorskaya we will create a visual journey with metamorphism and symbolism, inviting everyone to see those situations from a different angle.<br/><br/>UNDER THE SURFACE - will start a discussion about these emotions and conditions that we often hide under a mask and will bring them into the light.<br/><br/>We need support to rent technical equipment and for marketing to allow us to reach a bigger audience in Lithuania and abroad.

<h3>Hi.  I'm Matt.</h3>
<p>I'm a physicist, an artist, an engineer, a father, and a Burner.</p>
<p>Three years ago, at Burning Man, I stopped and asked myself: if I wanted to create art without boundaries, without regard for practicality, or possibility, or cost, what would I create?  Torch Song was the outcome of that process.</p>
<p>Giant flaming electronic metal art is difficult, and ambitious, and absurd.  And it is our monument to the absurd world we have all been thrust into.  We have made so much progress over the last three years.  We've built a prototype, assembled a team, and started production.  And we need your help to take it across the finish line.  <strong>And if you're interested in getting involved in the project, head down to the Come Help Us section below to find out how. </strong></p>
<h3>Absurd Times and Dangerous Art</h3>
<p>We recognize that the world has gotten a lot scarier for a lot of people since we embarked on this project.  And, while we like our art dangerous, we don't like our world that way.  So, <strong>we will be donating 10% of the net proceeds from our fundraiser to the ACLU</strong>, to help keep the world a safe place for expressing dangerous ideas.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>Shit's expensive, man.  I've invested thousands of dollars into Torch Song already, and every penny was worth it.  And in addition to the raw materials like metal, electronics, and propane, we'll need to transport it and power it as well.</p>
<p><strong>But, more than your money, much much more, we need your support.  </strong>And your friends' support, and your friends' friends' support.  Because we want to make art for our community, and our world.  And we want you to be able to say that you helped out.</p>
<h3>Some of the Perks</h3>
<p><b>Stickers!  </b>Who doesn't love stickers?</p>

</div></div>","Hi.  I'm Matt.
I'm a physicist, an artist, an engineer, a father, and a Burner.
Three years ago, at Burning Man, I stopped and asked myself: if I wanted to create art without boundaries, without regard for practicality, or possibility, or cost, what would I create?  Torch Song was the outcome of that process.
Giant flaming electronic metal art is difficult, and ambitious, and absurd.  And it is our monument to the absurd world we have all been thrust into.  We have made so much progress over the last three years.  We've built a prototype, assembled a team, and started production.  And we need your help to take it across the finish line.  And if you're interested in getting involved in the project, head down to the Come Help Us section below to find out how. 
Absurd Times and Dangerous Art
We recognize that the world has gotten a lot scarier for a lot of people since we embarked on this project.  And, while we like our art dangerous, we don't like our world that way.  So, we will be donating 10% of the net proceeds from our fundraiser to the ACLU, to help keep the world a safe place for expressing dangerous ideas.

Why We Need Your Help
Shit's expensive, man.  I've invested thousands of dollars into Torch Song already, and every penny was worth it.  And in addition to the raw materials like metal, electronics, and propane, we'll need to transport it and power it as well.
But, more than your money, much much more, we need your support.  And your friends' support, and your friends' friends' support.  Because we want to make art for our community, and our world.  And we want you to be able to say that you helped out.
Some of the Perks
Stickers!  Who doesn't love stickers?

Hoodies!

And, our custom designed pendant!
 Our Progress
Torch Song started out in my basement, building prototype after prototype after prototype, trying to get the exact effect I wanted.  And, some of those prototypes did not work out well.

But after a lot of sweat and a few singed eyebrows, we got to where we are today.  Each Torch Song unit uses high-torque planetary gear motors to drive a flame head shuttle along a set of rails:

The flames are powered by propane, and ignition comes from silicon-nitride hot surface ignitors



 

So far, we've built nine frames (the skeleton of each unit), and three of them almost completely ready.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>OH, hey there.  My dad, 21st century luddite and isolationist, has asked me to help him have an artshow that will do justice to the culmination of his life's work.  His work is incredible, detailed, palpable.  I would like him to have the recognition he deserves.  As a full-time teacher and grad student I don't have a lot of time to arrange a lot of little shows (that tend to take large commissions), so my goal is to raise money to have his artwork professionally and uniformly matted and framed, in preparation for a gallery show next Spring at the [ac2] space.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project is immensely important to both him and me.  My father has never had a show, not only because navigating the logistics of it is overwhelming for him, but also because he has never really wanted to let go of the work.  As fellow artists know, letting go of a work is the perhaps the most difficult, yet also the most imperative part of the artistic process.  Letting go is possibly the whole point of making art.  Yet all these many years he has clung to his paintings, drawings and collages, agonizing over details and never seeing them as complete.  From my perspective, art seemed more a source of pain and frustration than an outlet or a cathartic release.  And it is only now that my father feels he is ready to show himself--through his art--to the world, despite whatever imperfection or inconsistency may remain.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've looked into several galleries in Albuquerque and Santa Fe.  A majority of them don't accept work from unknown artists.  Those that do are often very small spaces that offer little exposure and take a significant commission on work sold.  As this is my father's life's work and his first show, I'm not willing to give away at least half of it just for the space.  Months and, in some cases, years have been poured into a two-dimensional representation.  Should someone wish to purchase a piece I feel it is only fair that my father recieve all of the profit.  </p>
<p>I have found a large space downtown that does not take a commission, but does require a $200 deposit and asks that the pieces be professionally framed and matted.  Funds will go to securing a space and having his art matted and framed.  Additional funds will go to publicity.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The magnitude of this project is limitless, it extends from the inward depths of a father and a daughter, to radiate out and into the depths of other human beings in the world.  It means the fulfillment of connection, the conclusion of an interpretation that, up to this point, remained visible and audible to only one man.  </p>
<p>As we are starting from nothing, every little bit is appreciated. ... to reflect an inner form of perception in motion, a representation of--as I see it--cognition before differentiation common to all beings in the world.  </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br/><br/>Political cartoons are more popular than ever. Cartoons are quick, bite-sized pieces of visual commentary that work great in print and on the Web. Cartoons spread across social networks like Facebook and Twitter like wildfire, look great on tablets and on smart phones, and can easily reach millions of readers in the click of a few buttons.  Editorial cartoons are part of state-mandated testing in 8th and 11th grade, and a part of the weekly homework for millions of students in America.<br/><br/>Editorial cartoonists are still widely syndicated in newspapers across the country and have a huge audience, but national syndication pays only a small fraction of what cartoonists made from traditional newspaper staff jobs, and as newspapers decline, cartoonist jobs have been cut, making editorial cartoonists an endangered species. The rate of editorial cartoonists leaving the profession has accelerated in recent years and months.<br/><br/>An important and popular part of the public debate is in danger of being lost. Today there are less than 70 editorial cartoonists in America who have staff jobs; a few years ago there were twice that number.  Cartoonists have been losing their jobs in tandem with newsroom journalists, but since there were fewer cartoonists to start with, the diminished numbers threaten the viability of our art form and it's role in the public debate.<br/><br/>You can help stop the decline of our profession, by saving one important voice at an important time.  You can keep Bill Day working, and we'll make sure his work continues to be a part of the public debate, seen by millions or readers.<br/> <br/><strong>Goals</strong><br/><br/>Our goal is to raise $35,000, to be paid as a ""salary"" to Bill to draw at least four editorial cartoons a week, every week, for an entire year. Bill's cartoons cover national issues, everything from the Presidential election to Wall Street, the dysfunctional Congress and our corrupt political system. We'll produce two eBook collections of his cartoons - ""2012: A Year in Cartoons"" and ""2013: A Year in Cartoons"" that will chronicle the events of the year through the spectrum of Bill's sharp wit and pen tips.<br/><br/>And if we're able to raise more; $70,000 or $100,000, we will keep Bill working at the important job of drawing political cartoons for the next 2-3 years.  All donated funds will be kept in a segregated fund for Bill's salary; CagleCartoons.com will not share in any of it; all of the funds, after Indiegogo's share and expenses, will go to Bill, in exchange for his commitment to continue his great work, and to provide the donors with great premiums, including Bill's original artwork.<br/><br/>Our unique American art form needs you.  Bill needs you.  Please, save our profession, save Bill and keep an important, progressive voice in the public debate by donating to keep Bill drawing for the next year and beyond.<br/><br/><em>For press inquiries, or to interview Bill Day, call (805) 969-2829 or email cari@cagle.com.</em></p>

We met as she was starting a new life after a divorce that forced her to walk away from all she had and start anew. Within our first year together, we did some traveling and she talked to me about her desire to teach felting in areas that had a long tradition of access to natural fibers (Wools, silk etc.) but had underdeveloped economies and industry. These artistic skills coupled with teaching some business skills, would enable local people to develop viable products that reflected their local traditions and cultures and have a demand on a world market.</p><p>Nuno-felting (sometimes called wet felting) is actually an ancient technique of binding together natural fibers using water and pressure. It can be used to make shelters, clothing, and wonderful artwork.

We met as she was starting a new life after a divorce that forced her to walk away from all she had and start anew. Within our first year together, we did some traveling and she talked to me about her desire to teach felting in areas that had a long tradition of access to natural fibers (Wools, silk etc.) but had underdeveloped economies and industry. These artistic skills coupled with teaching some business skills, would enable local people to develop viable products that reflected their local traditions and cultures and have a demand on a world market.Nuno-felting (sometimes called wet felting) is actually an ancient technique of binding together natural fibers using water and pressure. It can be used to make shelters, clothing, and wonderful artwork. It has great versatility and potential in helping people create functional products as well as unique and desirable products for resale.In March of 2012 Jennifer was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer and has been undergoing treatment.

I started working in clay 7 years ago, not realizing the role it would play in my life. It's a unique way that I communicate and process what's going on in my head. However, since finishing school and moving to LA, I haven't had access to a studio. I work for a small non-profit called Povertees, which is an organization that helps homeless people escape the cycle of poverty in downtown LA. It's been a huge change from my life in San Francisco, but I love what I do and the community I get to be a part of through it. However, it doesn't quite pay the bills, so I want to try my hand at selling my art. My goal for this campaign is to raise $1,600, which will kick start my way back into sculpting. The barriers I'm facing are (1) that I can't afford a studio membership, and (2) that I can't physically get to the studio because I don't have a car and the closest studio is in neighboring city Eagle Rock. So my solution is to convert my unused laundry room into a small studio space, and to get a firing membership at the studio, which is cheaper and allows me to use their kilns a couple times a month. The $1,600 will cover the cost of materials and membership for 4 months, along with the funds to create a studio in my laundry room. With this initial investment, I believe I will be able to launch myself into a freelance art career.

an artist living
in Brooklyn.
 I
graduated
in
2013 from SUNY Purchase School of Art
and
Design.
My entire life I've known
I
was meant to be an artist. My first interest
was
in graphic novels, and through
the years that interest
has sharpened to
include graphic
novels  illustrated
with fine linoleum
cut prints.  My
first
lino
cut book was about the environmental
impacts
of hydrofracking;  my
second
featured
 two stories about  travelers
and their experiences. 
This
second book was called “Cities of the Interior” and  was picked up by the  Booklyn
Artist  Collective soon
after
it was completed.<br/>Since
 “Cities
of the Interior” I've
 decided to
create
 another linoleum cut book, in a
limited edition
of twenty
hand-printed, hand-bound, numbered copies,
16 pages, pamphlet stitched.  It
will be called “Couchsurfing Tuscana” and will tell the story of an surreal hiking experience I had while backpacking summer 2013.<br/>I
crunched the numbers and determined that I
could achieve that goal on a tight budget of
 $600.00.  This
would cover the ink, special papers for the pages and covers, and the
linoleum blocks themselves.<br/>
I was
left feeling pretty worried.
I don't have anything close to that
kind of money.  I
moved to Brooklyn in October and have been living hand to mouth the whole time, working
miscellaneous jobs as I find them and taking an
occasional
freelance illustration commission.
 I’m
glad for the work but it doesn’t leave me the money to actually
create new art for my own projects.<br/>That’s
why I’m on indiegogo.com asking for your help in making my next

an artist living
in Brooklyn.
 I
graduated
in
2013 from SUNY Purchase School of Art
and
Design.
My entire life I've known
I
was meant to be an artist. My first interest
was
in graphic novels, and through
the years that interest
has sharpened to
include graphic
novels  illustrated
with fine linoleum
cut prints.  My
first
lino
cut book was about the environmental
impacts
of hydrofracking;  my
second
featured
 two stories about  travelers
and their experiences. 
This
second book was called “Cities of the Interior” and  was picked up by the  Booklyn
Artist  Collective soon
after
it was completed.Since
 “Cities
of the Interior” I've
 decided to
create
 another linoleum cut book, in a
limited edition
of twenty
hand-printed, hand-bound, numbered copies,
16 pages, pamphlet stitched.  It
will be called “Couchsurfing Tuscana” and will tell the story of an surreal hiking experience I had while backpacking summer 2013.I
crunched the numbers and determined that I
could achieve that goal on a tight budget of
 $600.00.  This
would cover the ink, special papers for the pages and covers, and the
linoleum blocks themselves.
I was
left feeling pretty worried.
I don't have anything close to that
kind of money.  I
moved to Brooklyn in October and have been living hand to mouth the whole time, working
miscellaneous jobs as I find them and taking an
occasional
freelance illustration commission.
 I’m
glad for the work but it doesn’t leave me the money to actually
create new art for my own projects.That’s
why I’m on indiegogo.com asking for your help in making my next
project a reality.  Thanks for looking at my campaign, and thanks for
considering a contribution.  No contribution too small – or too

<h4>About 2nd Floor Rear 2015</h4>
<ul> <li>
<p>This
year we want to bring you art,
performances, gatherings, happenings, installations, and events that warm you,
that draw you in, that make you want to stay.  We want you to experience
the intimate, the meditative. We want you all to feel present and connected
even in your winter fugue states. We want a safe place for audience and artist
to be vulnerable and wildish. We want things to resonate--to find you again
days later while you're waiting in line at the Walgreens checkout counter. The
premise of this year's festival is ultimately more of a feeling than an idea. It's
Chicagoans’ annual substitution of “stay warm” for “see you later”. It’s also
the hypnotic quiet at winter’s core that makes the season’s deep melancholy
savorable. <a href=""http://2ndfloorrear.org/2nd-floor-rear-2015/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read more about the concept driving this year's festival here.</a></p>

The Fallbacks
We believe that creative labor is valuable labor, and should be paid labor. While nobody’s going to get rich off this, offering our contract staff small stipends is, for us, a matter of integrity. The less money we have, the fewer people we can hire. If we don't reach our goal, we'll have to significantly reduce the number of proposals we can accept and make do with fewer documentarians. 

The Festival

Did we mention that your contributions help keep the festival free? For the fourth year in a row, there are no tickets to buy, no cover charge, and we want to keep it that way.

   Impact
Why do we do this?

Chicago has a robust, little-known history of showing art in “apartment galleries” and small, seemingly random venues. We started 2nd Floor because we wanted there to be a designated moment to highlight these spaces and practices. Other people sign up year after year because they believe in the festival. For creative folks, it's an incentive to make work, try new things, and experience culture, free from institutional strictures and commercial mandates. 

Who is festival for?
 It’s for you. It’s for us. It’s for all the creative folks in Chicago who want to make good work, who want to experiment, who want to share their practice with new audiences.
It's for our fellow hardcore Chicagoans who need a good reason to leave the house and offset the wintertime cabin fever.


It’s for capital-U ""Us""--producers of art and culture who dare to make something happen far from cultural epicenters like NY and LA. It’s for people who are interested in the kinds of creative activity that happens outside of the spotlight; when people make work to please themselves, their friends, their colleagues, and each other, and not their managers, gallerists, or the market. It’s for people who believe in art worlds, not “the art world”; who believe that creativity and culture are just too real and wild and sneaky to be beholden to any one, narrowly-defined location, conception of what art is, or socioeconomic structure.
 
   Risks & Challenges So, what could go wrong?


Scenario A--We don't get enough money to cover the
costs mentioned above.

Scenario B--Stuff happens: inclement weather, programmatic changes, participants or locations fall through, the apocalypse picks that weekend to wreak havoc on earth...

How would we address said things going wrong?




Scenario A--We tighten our belts and make do with
less. This will likely mean reducing the number of events in order to minimize
staff. Between our summer fundraiser with Threewalls and application fees, we
will have almost enough to cover 1st priority expenses, but it'll be tight. AND
we'll have nothing to spend on the events themselves, which will be tough on
the artists and organizations producing events, and way less fun for the
audience. 




Scenario B--We'll handle it. We'll make adjustments
as needed. This is 2nd Floor Rear's fourth year running, and we've got this.
Money is biggest obstacle.

<p>We are a pair of cousins from Bogotá, Colombia. Zas is
a graffiti artist and graphic designer. Laura is an academic researcher with an
editorial background. We both love books and we sure love to make them. We
share a common interest for graffiti and street art, and we realized that there
are a lot of graffiti painted in the streets of most cities around the world,
but there are few books about why graffiti artists are doing what they do. We
know that there is a lot of repression and that graffiti is considered
a crime in almost every city. Nevertheless, graffiti is everywhere. </p>
<p>We decided to make a book about artists' motivation to
make graffiti. We found a common feeling generated by a discontent with
the city environment and its everyday life policies that calls to creative
action, and we decided to call that feeling <b>'romantic'</b>. Our
book is a bilingual (Spanish and English) compilation of texts, fragments,
songs, essays and drawings on diverse subjects that express this
common feeling from the point of view of graffiti artists. Our compilation
does not include photographs of graffiti, for that we hope you go out to the
streets to see graffiti for yourself.</p>

We decided to make a book about artists' motivation to

The Passion for Freedom Festival – www.passionforfreedom.co.uk – celebrates and encourages freedom of speech and artistic expression at the time when different voices undermine value of one secular law for all citizens in a democratic society. 
The Festival is evolving from an art competition which previous edition took place in November 2010 and has drawn over 400 viewers to UNIT24 Gallery in London Southbank by Tate Modern. The exhibition has presented works by award winning international artists: Anna Sundt, Svitlana Grebenyuk, Roberta Coni and Maja Wolna. The visitors were moved by the Cannes nominated ‘Little Bride’ documentary by Leszek Dobrucki. The event has drawn attention of numerous international groups which promote freedom of speech and secular law. There have been numerous articles and interviews that followed the successful exhibition.
At 2011 Festival we are presenting works selected from an Open Call to international art community and works and publications selected for its significance in protecting the freedom and democracy in our society.
 
The Impact
Civitas estimates that there are at least 85 Sharia courts in Britain that implement and enforce the Sharia law, mainly covering issues such as divorce. Considering the severe disadvantage women are in the first place, (and the many that are unaware of their rights under British law) that proceedings are not recorded and that there is no legal accountability, it’s clear that activism and action is needed. Fuelled by this need for action and legal equality, the artwork for the Passion for Freedom Festival aims to promote awareness about importance of secular law in a democratic society. It strives to give artists the voice to express views on topics that some find to difficult to discuss. Be it out of political correctness or fear of repression.
 
‘I really loved the phrase of exhibition’s curator: “There are regimes that are afraid of art, but artists are not afraid of regimes’...that’s the way I want to use my art.’ Roberta Coni, one of the PfF winners, 2010
 
‘Meaningful art. I have found it here at the festival. A high quality event!’ Leszek Dobrucki, ‘Little Bride’ director
‘The show is amazing. I am impressed with the artists’ maturity and approach to the subject matter. I wasn’t aware of Sharia courts in Britain until now. It is really disturbing.’ John student at St. Martin's College of Art, London
What We Need & What You Get
The non-profit festival is run by a very small group of passionate people committed to protecting our freedom and equality in modern, democratic society. They spend their own money and time to make it happen. Although we are supported by One Law for All organization and few generous private donors we are striving to develop the Festival and deliver the message to the wider international community. 
If everyone who ever came to the Passion for Freedom have given $15 we’d reach this modest goal.

<div>I've always wanted to illustrate a children's book...He always wanted to become a published children's book author.  Little Myrtle is a dream come true for both of us.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We love Myrtle! She is love and she's full of the beauty of life!  And, to our team, she's like family.  The book was certainly a family effort.  Paul Trefz is the author of the children's poem which I interpreted into collage based on the drawings of Paul's young daughter.  The children featured in the song are our children and god children.  Over the past year, we have worked on the illustrations, design and layout of the book. </div>
<h2><strong>An amazingly positive response from the public!</strong></h2>
<div>We had a short run of the book printed this Spring and quickly sold them all!  In the process, we were able to get the feedback of more than 500 individuals in Philadelphia...And they loved Myrtle as much as we do!  We found that the book made people smile and even chuckle out loud; children were anxious to get their hands on it. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Adults wanted to talk about the moral of the story or they were inspired to tell us about their own dreams of creating  a children's book.  Most surprising was that people we met while vending were so grateful for our presence. We realized that beyond creating literature we were creating public spaces for sharing stories around the value of dreams, family and self determination.  Myrtle had become a public performance!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We collected signatures from people who read or bought the book.  We wondered: how could we make Little Myrtle More than a local phenomenon?  And just how many signatures could we collect in six months?  A million? That's a stretch...but it's fun to dream big isn't it? That's what the Myrtle's Millions tour is about.</div>
<h2><strong>Please support our book project!</strong></h2>
<div>Your contributions will get us started in really distributing the book to the public.  We will be able to pay for a larger printing of at least 2,000 books (but of course we'll print as many as you order!). Contributions will also pay for promotional materials and transportation.  We will be able to travel with our family to create spaces where children and children's literature are loved. <br/><p>By contributing to our campaign you get to become a part of Myrtle's story and a part our family's experiment in social entrepreneurship.  <span id=""taw"" style=""margin-right: 0;""></span></p>

<h2>Other Ways You Can Help:</h2>
<p>Even if you don't have children in your immediate family, books are a great gift for young friends, cousins, neices, nephews, grandchildren or other loved ones.  Children's books are great gifts for teachers, child care providers, therapists, and others who work with children.  And you know what? Some adults just love children's books.  We do! </p>
<p>Not everyone can afford to contribute financially...We'd still love you to be a part of the campaign! </p>
<p>Please help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign using the Indiegogo share tools!  If you know someone who love books, children and art, please let them know what we're doing.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> There aren't many challenges when it comes to printing. I'm very familiar with the process and I can assure you that I know what is needed to make it go smoothly. Granted, there is still room for error so I will keep everyone abreast of that if it happens!</p>
<p>As for the content, the art is all done. (Which is the easiest part for me!) I just need to lay the book itself out, which isn't difficult for me either, but will take a couple of weeks to do; which I plan to do during the campaign's run, so the book will be ready to go off to the printer by the end of it. </p>
<p>I will also have a third party company fulfill, process, and ship the book to you. This takes the slack off my back as I have a lot on my plate already to focus on.</p>

I will also have copies available at NYCC in October this year, so if you're going, I suggest just grabbing one from me there! There will not be a ton of re-printings. This means probably one or two very small re-printings for future sales, not ""always available forever"".








Risks & Challenges  There aren't many challenges when it comes to printing. I'm very familiar with the process and I can assure you that I know what is needed to make it go smoothly. Granted, there is still room for error so I will keep everyone abreast of that if it happens!
As for the content, the art is all done. (Which is the easiest part for me!) I just need to lay the book itself out, which isn't difficult for me either, but will take a couple of weeks to do; which I plan to do during the campaign's run, so the book will be ready to go off to the printer by the end of it. 
I will also have a third party company fulfill, process, and ship the book to you. This takes the slack off my back as I have a lot on my plate already to focus on.



If You Can't Help~
Please share this around! I will extremely appreciate it if you shared this on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and anywhere else to get the word out! You can use the handy tools right here on Indiegogo to help do that. 


That's about it! Thanks so much for reading, considering, and helping out! It's truly appreciated and I will continue to put my best foot (or drawing hand… well, my only drawing hand) out there!Layout Previews",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is deemed necessary, as it's contributing to provide more justice for people who have no voice; More just world means more peace, more prosperity for others. It is not fair that sort of people are born with all opportunities, while others grow to be less privileged, ignorant and with less opportunities. We want to contribute to a peaceful world, may be we will not be able to serve all the world but this is the portion that we can contribute with.</p>
<p>successful stories:</p>
<p><u><i><strong>Diana SUCCESS STORY </strong></i></u></p>
<p>Her petite steps started at the moment she joined Y4Y program; “I felt that this is the place where I belong to, the place where I can exploit my potentials, I was happy. I used to wait day by day to go to the training.” This is how Diana described her feelings towards drama and theatre which she knew about through the program of Y4Y.  As she was one among the outstanding graduates she was followed up with, by the theatre, and she had the chance to participate in drama workshops, and several productions with YT. In 2013 Diana surpassed the first societal boundaries when she played the main role of a play which its core theme –sexual harassment- is considered to be a taboo in Hebron. Her passion towards theatre and drama was stronger than any obstacle that might hinder her ambition.  In 2015 Diana was chosen to be the protagonist of YT grand production “Handala”. The decision of choosing Diana for this role was challenging for both YT and Diana herself. And  this is due to the high artistic quality of this work. However, challenge was accepted. Sweat and long hours of working were spent to create the character “Fatima” –the protagonist of the play “Handala”-</p>

It's about science. It's a place to sit and think. It's a place to talk and dance. It's a gateway and a beacon to Black Rock Observatory.

<p><i>Golden Record? What’s that? </i></p>
<p>The real Voyager Golden Record was launched in 1977 and is now out in space somewhere far beyond Pluto. Interstellar Emissary looks exactly like the Golden Record, except ours is way bigger, is made of lucite, and it glows with a rainbow of LED lights! </p>

<p>Our Interstellar Emissary will include the same sounds as the original Golden Record. Yes, you'll be able to hear the very same sounds that aliens will hear! </p>

<p>We're taking Interstellar Emissary to Burning Man 2015 where it will be a beacon in deep playa.  As you approach the Interstellar Emissary, sensors will cause the lights to glow more brightly.

Interstellar Emissary is an
homage to the Golden Record on the Voyager Spacecraft. And the Desert Wizards
of Mars are bringing it to Burning Man in 2015.

Interstellar Emissary is about space. It's about science. It's a place to sit and think. It's a place to talk and dance. It's a gateway and a beacon to Black Rock Observatory. It honors and celebrates the magnificent work that created the Golden Record.
Golden Record? What’s that? 
The real Voyager Golden Record was launched in 1977 and is now out in space somewhere far beyond Pluto. Interstellar Emissary looks exactly like the Golden Record, except ours is way bigger, is made of lucite, and it glows with a rainbow of LED lights! 

The Golden Record is a phonograph record (ask your parents) containing sounds and images of Earth, and NASA/JPL launched it into space in hopes that intelligent
extraterrestrial life, or possibly future humans, would find it and be able to learn about life on Earth. 
Our Interstellar Emissary will include the same sounds as the original Golden Record. Yes, you'll be able to hear the very same sounds that aliens will hear! 

We're taking Interstellar Emissary to Burning Man 2015 where it will be a beacon in deep playa.  As you approach the Interstellar Emissary, sensors will cause the lights to glow more brightly. Continued motion will cause the colors to change -- you will be actively participating in the creation of the experience. 
We've built a prototype:



And we've begun testing:
We even took it out for Yuri's night where a certain someone tried to strike up a conversation:
Now we need your help getting the project completed and ready for Burning Man.*** Donations are TAX DEDUCTIBLE. ***Interstellar Emissary is a project of the Desert Wizards of Mars -- the very same crew who built Black Rock Observatory and the Mars Rover Art Car.  So you know this will be epic. 


Technical details:
Interstellar Emissary will feature a 6' diameter lucite disc replicating the symbols on the Golden Record. Programmed LED lighting will make this an interactive art piece. The sounds of Earth will greet you as you approach the piece.
We'll have a 16' x 16' raised stage where you can interact with the piece and with other people, creating an adaptive lighting and sound experience.
Although it's a completely separate project, the Interstellar Emissary will act as a beacon to help you find your way to Black Rock Observatory, our sister project, using lasers to guide you across deep playa. And like all projects of the Desert Wizards of Mars, this will be an educational piece. Our goal has always been to create art that gets people excited about science.
Design concepts:

Our designs for the structure that supports the Emissary include a stage (yay dancing!) and shade structures (yay for daytime sun relief!). 

As you approach, you'll reach a swirling vortex of steps leading you to the stage where you can dance beneath the glow of the Interstellar Emissary.

These designs have been formulated so the structure can be scaled to your level
 of support. It will be tweaked to be in keeping with the vision shown in the 
video above as our funding levels increase.  
DISCLAIMER:This is an art project that is 100% citizen funded and 
there is no official relationship with Caltech, JPL or NASA. Any 
employees of the above organizations participating on the project do so 
as private citizens of the arts and do so on their own non-work time.


   What We Need & What You Get 
We need funding to get this amazing piece of art built and transported out to Black Rock City and we'd love to have your help!
Funding Goal = $ 14,850.00
This will help us pay for a huge amount of awesome: 
Laser cut disc, lighting, hardware, sensors, sound controls and speakers, a stage and seating, transportation, and power.
Stretch Goal = $ 23,930.00
If
 we surpass our Funding Goal, our Stretch Goal can help us make this 
even more amazing! We'll add a superstructure and more lighting. And 
some trusses, rigging, and wings!
We have some fantastic perks for our supporters! 

OMG you can have a disc of your own! Various sizes! Check our perks list and be ready to pick your jaw up off the floor.
Tee shirts! Stickers! Patches! Sew your patches on your tee shirts! 
Perks will ship in October 2015!
Did we mention your donation is tax deductible? It is!

<p>Après une première performance en 2015 avec «Brume- De la Légende au Mythe» (voir vidéo ci-dessus) qui regroupait 9 robes issues de travaux personnels réalisés par Clara Maeda
lors de ces 5 dernières années, «Back to Pagan» se compose de robes entièrement
réalisées autour d’un même thème, s’inspirant aussi bien des mythologies pré-chré-
tiennes, que de mouvements artistiques tels le préraphaélisme,
l’impressionisme ou l’Art nouveau.<br/>
Malgré tout, dans une démarche toujours proche de celle du costume, chaque robe

<p>Alexandra Banti est une photographe Française, attirée tout d’abord par le dessin et le métier d’illustratrice, elle découvrit la photographie durant son BTS de communication visuelle. Elle entreprit alors d’exercer sa passion en parallèle de ses études, apprenant au fil des shootings et des rencontres enrichissantes. Elle met en scène, crée des tenues et des coiffes mais aussi maquille et coiffe ses modèles la plupart du temps. </p>
<p>Elle s’intéresse donc aussi beaucoup à l’histoire du costume et de la mode (de la renaissance aux années 70), aux mœurs et coutumes d’autres époques et à la place de la femme dans la société. En effet, on remarque aisément que cette dernière tient une place très importante dans son travail. Tantôt femme fatale, tantôt éthérée, elle séduit ou émeu, mais toujours dans un soucis d’élégance et de beauté. Son but n’est pas de placer la femme en objet de désir, mais plus de jouer sur le côté « mystique » qu’elle peut avoir.</p>
<p>Alexandra fait partie intégrante du projet depuis le début, apportant son soutien et surtout de magnifiques images autour de ces performances.</p>

Après une première performance en 2015 avec «Brume- De la Légende au Mythe» (voir vidéo ci-dessus) qui regroupait 9 robes issues de travaux personnels réalisés par Clara Maeda
lors de ces 5 dernières années, «Back to Pagan» se compose de robes entièrement
réalisées autour d’un même thème, s’inspirant aussi bien des mythologies pré-chré-
tiennes, que de mouvements artistiques tels le préraphaélisme,
l’impressionisme ou l’Art nouveau.
Malgré tout, dans une démarche toujours proche de celle du costume, chaque robe
a sa propre identité, son propre symbolisme, sa propre histoire à raconter. 







«Back to Pagan» est un retour aux sources, aux relations intrinsèques de l’homme
avec la nature et sa spiritualité profonde.


Au commencement, il y avait la lumière, 
lueur de clair de lune entre les branches entremêlées du Grand Arbre.
Naissance teintée de pourpre, fluide filin de vie. 
Beauté éphémère d’un pétale aux joues rosées, 
relent de charogne drapée de sensualité,
la fragilité impalpable de l’être qui fut et qui devint. 
Car à l’aube du crépuscule, vie et mort entrelacent leurs mains.
Au couché du Levant, d’un cœur endormi s’envole l’âme papillonnant.










Plus qu’un simple défilé, «Back to Pagan» se veut proche du
spectacle vivant, à l’attention du grand public et non d’une
simple audiance de professionnels de la mode.

Chaque modèle incarne son personnage et la symbolique autour de chaque robe, dans des mouvements parfois proche de
la danse, ou encore d’un jeu d’acteur.

10 robes défilent au son de la musique live sur une dizaine
de minutes, comme une histoire mystérieuse contée aux spectateurs, une parenthèse hors du temps qui espère provoquer
chez chacun et chacune des émotions pleines de douceurs et
de poésie, tout comme des sentiments forts et fulgurants. 













Pourquoi ce financement participatif?
Depuis 1 an et demi Clara Maeda travaille sans relâche pour vous présenter des créations uniques, mises en scène grâce au travail bénévole de toute une équipe : modèles, coiffeuse, maquilleuse, photographe, musiciens.
19 robes au total, entre les créations de ""Brume"" présentées en 2015 et maintenant celles de ""Back to Pagan"", toutes inédites et non destinées à la vente. Tout ceci représente des mois et des mois de travail, des centaines et centaines d'euros de tissus.
Au delà des créations en elles-même, organiser des défilés représente de grosses dépenses. Si pour la deuxième année consécutive, l'évènement Magic de Monaco fait confiance à Clara Maeda en tant qu'invitée, emmener toute une équipe sur place demande un gros budget. 
De plus, cette année, le nouveau défilé ""Back to Pagan"" sera présenté à Paris le 1er mars prochain, et l'évènement est entièrement auto-organisé.
Vous l'aurez compris, nous aider à financer ce projet, c'est couvrir au moins une petite partie des dépenses matérielles ou logistiques déjà engendrées (location de salle, achat de fonds photos, matériel de mise en scène, tissus, frais de transport etc…), et nous permettre peut-être, si le palier minimum de 500€ est dépassé d'envisager de nouvelles créations, de nouvelles performances. Bref, de nous aider à faire perdurer notre passion au service du Beau et de l'Art.



Quelques mots sur les acteurs du projet


Suivant les pas de ses arrière-grands-parents, tailleurs et couturières de profession, Clara Maeda est une créatrice normande expatriée au Japon, un pays qu’elle a réussi à apprivoiser à travers sa belle-famille nippone et son immersion dans l’apprentissage du «wasai», l’art de la confection du kimono.

Forte de ces métissages culturels, de son savoir faire et son amour du détail, Clara Maeda navigue sur les traces du japonisme entre Europe et Asie, histoire et modernité, aime brouiller les lignes, dépasser les frontières.
Elle réalise depuis son atelier de Nara des créations sur-mesure et originales pour un public très varié : robes de mariées, costumes, corsets féminins et masculins, mode alternative et prêt à porter d’inspiration historique.
Entre lolitas historiques et paganisme cosmopolite, elle a su créer une mode unique, puisant son inspiration aussi bien dans l’imaginaire des hommes que dans leur Histoire. Des kilomètres de tissu qui font le trait d’union entre les époques et les cultures, entre le conte et le réel, entre la France et le Japon. 



Encore une fois, ces créations autour du vêtement seront appuyées par la musique live de Yuichiro, qui viendra cette fois-ci en solo accompagner la performance avec une musique originale.Guitariste et compositeur japonais, Yuichiro Maeda a été élevé dans une famille à la fois respectueuse des traditions ancestrales et très ouverte sur le monde, deux notions qui marqueront sa vie personnelle et professionnelle.

the Vermont Studio Center in Johnson, VT, USA for September - October 2016, and need
your assistance in getting there. As a “Thank You,"" original

About My Work


 The search for something new; unique forms and
compositions, in our everyday landscapes are some of the items that I am
constantly searching for as the major elements to my work, and as a Midwestern
painter, New England will add some freshness to new pieces while using Johnson, VT and it’s surrounding communities and environments as subject matter. One of the
most important contributors to the work, are the archaic utility poles
& wires that are intertwined into the landscapes, both urban and

""connectors"" of community's relationships, their news, and information --- even today in a
technologically modern world that is rapidly going wireless, and some would
argue that the technology has aided in society’s literal disconnect from each other. I would like to utilize the same concept yet in a different locale for some of the work that'll be produced while attending this residency.


During this
experience, and as an addition to other work that will be made for the duration of the program, I will be documenting the trip by car and plane through paintings and drawings. With this project I'll be challenging myself to make at least piece of artwork a day
for the duration of the residency. The mediums will range from gouache, watercolor, ink and oil. When all of the work has been produced during the month long residency, I will then find a venue to display the produced work. 
On average, the majority of my

polished yet with the one painting a day exercise that I’ll be adhering to, the

If you’re able to help achieve this
goal, not only will it be greatly appreciated but you’ll also be rewarded
with some original artwork. I look forward to sharing my work and progress with you.

<p>Juan Luis Guerra &amp; Caetano Veloso, gracias por darnos vida! I join artist Alejandro Ghersi (Arca) as I remember emails in which we discussed identities and black canvases. And also join Rita Indiana's immediate response at a Harvard university interview, when saying she would fight for her queer family in front of her ""latin"" family on any given day.</p>
<p>I missed Club Fonograma so much.</p>
<p>Is it crazy that I think of myself as an artist, and not a journalist? ""I wish I could paint our love"" just like Miguel. I'm not that gifted, but one day I hope to make movies like those shot on the evening empire: when the worst of all loose ourselves at night, on a ballad of vampires, night crawlers, druggies, and Bob Dylan reflecting on existence.</p>
<p>How do I come to my dad (a 1st grade dropout who learned how to read and write in both English and Spanish in his late 40's so that my twin brother and I could become citizens of this country) and explain to him that there's a whole other world beyond Chalino Sánchez and Los Hermanos Almada. Are we in front of another allegory of the cave, or is this another case of Christianity vs Jackie Chan in the new spider web? When all my friends around me are stuck on the Coen brothers, I'm already surveying the Dardenne brothers for true transgression and growth.</p>
<p>Am I also the son of David Lynch, Carlos Reygadas, Apitchatpong Weerasethakul, Michael Haneke and Gus Van Sant? Godard? Dumont? T. Dreyer? Through the years, I keep re-visiting my favorite film of all time... Memorias del Subdesarrollo, what would I do without you. Thank you Kiarostami for acknowledging art dealers and the battle of replicas vs wearing your references well in Copie Conforme. And thank you Claire Danes for that ending in Beau Travail -makes me want to dance.</p>
<p>Let's not victimize ourselves. That has caused too many wars and creates vicious cycles of unfortunate leaders in both pop culture and politics. Here I'm asking for advice, and for your help. Sometimes I wear that badge from Tony Gallardo's ""Líder Juvenil"" (que sabes de mi vida, que mueves grandes masas), with a big smile on my face. Who do I talk to about rhetoric, hedonism, zeitgeist, and a new ideal/renaissance man? James Franco?</p>
<p>Juan Luis Guerra. God. Papi. No' ta llevando el diablo!</p>
<p>Everyday I sing along Guille Milkyway about love and becoming the new Yma Sumac, take advice on finances and patents from Doble Pletina, croon about the eloquence of alternative/parallel times (quantum physics) with Coiffeur, and make the relentless case that we are all the children of god through that masterpiece of a song by Dios-que himself: ""me mantengo frágil, feliz, manchado de sangre, cura vaginal, hombre vivo soy - soy hombre vivo!""</p>
<p>Not to brag, but I've also had a bromance with Ezra (yes, the vampire), and we've been singing about our sophomore year with reggaeton and that inevitable moment where our ancestral lineages will intersect yet again.... ""it's a line that's always running, I can feel it coming."" Let's keep the sexual exploration within ""Cousins."" Don't make me turn around to Babylon, Israelites and the motherland with ""Ya Hey"" this early in the career.</p>
<p>It's hard to keep it going without a salary. Hey fellow hipster, if you know what a true hipster is (a music geek), can tell the difference between trends and revivalists... you, like us, are part of the true Rebeldes (yes, that album by Alex Anwandter). If you're still stuck on the loop of who did it first? Rebelde Way or Rebelde Güey. Then you ought to reflect on your scholarship and pedigree. Go back to ""Daughters,"" ""back when Kanye was sweet and innocent, and John had no filters."" -- @dbchic, redditt.</p>
<p>I was around when P4K named ""BOB"" by Outkast as their number one song of the decade, but I much preferred Stylus' choice of ""Ignition"" (Remix) by R. Kelly as the track that merited the -song of the aughts- crown. Pitchfork has never reviewed our diva, Javiera Mena (they barely met Carla Morrison). But Stylus validated Club Fonograma's choice of ""Al Siguiente Nivel"" on their very own list. And that choice felt effortless and clean of the politics of diversity, integration, or assimilation.</p>
<p>So who do you go to when you need funding for your art and your craft? 15 years blogging now and I'm still feeling like this: taking two steps back, every time. Consulting you, my friends and sources. Hoping that you won't charge for your knowledge. Any other enfant-terribles out there? (I feel completely unapologetic about adding myself to the list). How did you do it? Why are there no sponsorships or grants for those new visceral, sharp, critical ""pens"" out there. No beers or sneakers have ever wanted to sponsor our pages despite dozens of meetings. ""Too risky,"" they say. I'm quite optimistic though! The stuff that's coming.... as Matilda Manzana sighs in ""Ciencias Natuales,"" ""sensacional.. lo que vendra... no te imaginas!""</p>
<p>So, my Club Fonograma, Cahiers du Cinema, Slant Magazine &amp; P4k kids.... time to evoke Luis Buñuel and Tomás Gutiérrez Alea. Too many times I've scratched my head and gasped, if Don Luis Buñuel only knew what came of his muse. Silvia Pinal, you have no idea how much damage you've done to us with your molding of La Guadalupana. That tear-jerking, overprotective, and suffered mother keeps aborting the authentic, visceral arts, to instead, subscribe to the norm of Televisa, Univision, and now, Pantaleon Films. Where is the progress of that last supper-turned orgy as a form of almost-absolute artistic freedom (Viridiana) And what about the final dance? La carne radioactiva (Simón del Desierto). You know, the kind of bravura that's so often tailored to a communist or fascist agenda. Sometimes, raw creations result in bloodsheds (Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom), and sometimes it competes for the Golden Palm.</p>
<p>""Cuba libre e independiente.... quien iba sospechar todo esto, sin el aguila imperial... ¿Y la paloma que iba mandar Picasso?""</p>
<p>Why is it that most Academy-award winning films equate to child pornography in my scope? Yeah... I'm one of those extremists, but one that keeps integrity at every margin. Let's celebrate Year-End lists and not the Latin Grannys. Let's take those movies to Critic's Week and, unless you're inviting Cronenberg &amp; Lynch for the ride, skip Hollywood altogether. Let's put those are you a Mexican or a Mexican't? clichéd, lazy-ass jokes to rest and make the Mexi-Cannes circuit real. Above all, let's put politics aside and look beyond our borders and margins of fear. Take a chance and put deadpan comedy and hubris on every conversation.But, for what it's worth, yes Louis CK, you are more Mexican than George Lopez will ever be.</p>
<p>Time to take on the advice of our friend, the great but never stranged Rafa Saavedra (you paved the way, and your work and passion!! lives with us). Time for ""Otros Mundos, Otras Estrellas.""

<p><strong>Espace habité / inhabited space</strong> <i>Nouvelles perspectives du bijou contemporain au Québec </i>réunit treize jeunes créatrices qui actuellement se démarquent par leur intention artistique. Depuis quelques années, le bijou québécois s’est fait remarquer dans le cadre d’événements internationaux. Cette exposition présentée à l’Institut national des métiers d’art à Paris du 27 septembre au 15 décembre 2017 souligne ce nouvel enthousiasme. Initié par Stéphane Blackburn et Noel Guyomarc’h, ce projet permet de faire découvrir en dehors de nos frontières l’impulsion créatrice de ces artistes qui composent une nouvelle génération au Québec. Les commissaires remercient l’association <i>d’Un bijou à l’autre</i> qui réédite la manifestation internationale qu’est devenue <strong>Parcours bijoux 2017</strong>. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Espace habité / Inhabited Space </strong>brings together thirteen young Quebec jewellers whose artistic and creative approaches are remarkable. Canadian jewellery, for several years now, has been standing out in national and overbroad recognized events and manifestations. Initiated and curated by Stephane Blackburn and Noel Guyomarc’h, this exhibition aims at promoting that enthusiasm by highlighting the creative impulse of a new generation of talents and offering them a broader visibility. It will be presented from September 27 to December 15 at the Institut national des métiers d’art de Paris during Parcours Bijoux 2017 event.</p>
<p>Pour mettre de l’avant cette édition parisienne, nous désirons amasser 5000$ qui servira en autres à créer un carton d’invitation, des affiches ainsi qu’un catalogue d’exposition. Ces outils promotionnels sont indispensables à la mise en valeur des oeuvres de nos créatrices. Notre objectif est de valoriser leurs qualités artistiques et d’aider la diffusion de leur oeuvres sur la scène internationale. Votre soutien serait grandement apprécié. Nous vous invitons à suivre nos actualités sur notre page facebook: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Espace-habit%C3%A9-Inhabited-space-456287724756226/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/Espace-habité-Inhabit...</a></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>To promote</strong> this exhibition in Paris, we would like to collect $5000 to produce invitation cards, flyers and a catalogue of the exhibition. These promotional tools are essential to value the artistic quality of the work by our artists. Your help is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Ce titre Espace habité / inhabited space fait référence à la provenance géographique et à l’expression culturelle commune des artistes sélectionnées, chacune cependant avec son espace créatif distinct.  Le langage plastique des œuvres démontre la richesse et la diversité issues d’une région perçue parfois éloignée et habituellement illustrée d’images fantasmées d’espaces infinis et sauvages. Les intentions artistiques référent avant tout au regard que chacune pose sur son entourage, sur des préoccupations environnementales, sociales parfois politiques, personnelles, bref des thématiques universelles. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Espace habité / Inhabited Space</strong> refers both to their geographical origin and to their share of a common practice, but also to how each of them have invested a very personal and distinctive creative space.  The diversity of their plastic language sheds light on the richness of a region often perceived as remote and fantasized as wild and distant lands. As to their artistic intent, it refers to how they perceive the world and relate to environmental, social, political or personal issues.</p>
<p>Mais avec ironie ou humour, et un goût prononcé pour la couleur, de nombreuses œuvres partagent un élan de vitalité audacieux dans un contexte souvent austère et dramatique du bijou de création. Les bijoux animés de Magali Thibault Gobeil reflètent une personnalité flamboyante et gourmande, les créations d’Aurélie Guillaume racontent des histoires ludiques avec des personnages étranges et caricaturés haut en couleur. Plein d’humour et d’ironie,  les bijoux figuratifs ou narratifs de Silvie Altschuler sont construits de matériaux contraires tant dans leur consistance que dans leur valeur inhérente. Marie-Maude Brunet, utilisant des moules acquis d’autres joailliers a commencé une série ou la tête de mort, symbole de puissance, de culte et de mysticisme, est associée à des fleurs, symbole de vie. Le paradoxe se retrouve également chez d’autres artistes.  Juxtaposant bois flotté et plastique transformé, les broches d’Anne-Marie Rébillard évoquent ses préoccupations écologiques en associant les rejets naturels et humains.  De son côté, bien qu’utilisant des couleurs vives pour ses bijoux en porcelaine, Catherine Granche transcrit la transformation naturelle des aliments abandonnés sur nos comptoirs, comme des artefacts du quotidien. Marie-Ève G. Castonguay, Émilie Trudel et Gabrielle Desmarais, par des esthétiques, des compositions et des attitudes différentes proposent des visions de l’espace, de l’environnement, de la nature. Emilie Dell’Aniello évoque les tangibles interprétations du  contenant, une forme modelée en bronze recouverte de peinture acrylique, l’élément central de sa collection.

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>With irony and humour</strong>, and a pronounced taste for colour, most of the exhibited pieces share a welcome and daring impulse for life in the often stern and dramatic context of creative jewellery. The animated creations of Magali Thibault Gobeil reflect her exuberant and lively personality. Aurelie Guillaume’s enamel pieces tell stories of caricatured and colourful characters born from her fertile and vivid imagination. Full of humour and irony, Silvie Altschuler’s figurative or narrative pieces are made with opposed materials in terms of both worth and consistency. Marie-Maude Brunet, for her part, has been using moulds acquired from other jewellers. She undertook a series in which the skull, a symbol of power, religion and mysticism, is associated with flowers, a symbol of life. Paradoxes of that kind can be found in other works. Using driftwood and synthetic plastic in her brooches, Anne-Marie Rébillard illustrates environmental concerns by associating natural and human waste. Catherine Granche’s porcelain jewels, despite their bright colours, are meant to be images of how food leftovers transform, as artefact of daily life. Marie-Eve G. Castonguay, Emilie Trudel and Gabrielle Desmarais, through different aesthetics, compositions and attitudes, offer new perspectives on space, environment and nature. In Emilie Dell’Aniello’s work, a bronze-made shape, covered with acrylic paint, stands as the central element of her collection to evoke different tangible interpretations of the content. Meanwhile, Katia Martel’s materials, nylon stockings, embroideries and laces, question our intimate relationship with jewellery and Catherine Sheedy, through a metaphorical rewriting of Icarus’ story, explores the idea that we may gain access to our dreams. Anne-Sophie Vallée questions movements and jewellery's interaction with the body through meticulously designed and articulated pieces.</p>

</div></div>","Espace habité / inhabited space Nouvelles perspectives du bijou contemporain au Québec réunit treize jeunes créatrices qui actuellement se démarquent par leur intention artistique. Depuis quelques années, le bijou québécois s’est fait remarquer dans le cadre d’événements internationaux. Cette exposition présentée à l’Institut national des métiers d’art à Paris du 27 septembre au 15 décembre 2017 souligne ce nouvel enthousiasme. Initié par Stéphane Blackburn et Noel Guyomarc’h, ce projet permet de faire découvrir en dehors de nos frontières l’impulsion créatrice de ces artistes qui composent une nouvelle génération au Québec. Les commissaires remercient l’association d’Un bijou à l’autre qui réédite la manifestation internationale qu’est devenue Parcours bijoux 2017. 
Espace habité / Inhabited Space brings together thirteen young Quebec jewellers whose artistic and creative approaches are remarkable. Canadian jewellery, for several years now, has been standing out in national and overbroad recognized events and manifestations. Initiated and curated by Stephane Blackburn and Noel Guyomarc’h, this exhibition aims at promoting that enthusiasm by highlighting the creative impulse of a new generation of talents and offering them a broader visibility. It will be presented from September 27 to December 15 at the Institut national des métiers d’art de Paris during Parcours Bijoux 2017 event.
Pour mettre de l’avant cette édition parisienne, nous désirons amasser 5000$ qui servira en autres à créer un carton d’invitation, des affiches ainsi qu’un catalogue d’exposition. Ces outils promotionnels sont indispensables à la mise en valeur des oeuvres de nos créatrices. Notre objectif est de valoriser leurs qualités artistiques et d’aider la diffusion de leur oeuvres sur la scène internationale. Votre soutien serait grandement apprécié. Nous vous invitons à suivre nos actualités sur notre page facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Espace-habité-Inhabit...
To promote this exhibition in Paris, we would like to collect $5000 to produce invitation cards, flyers and a catalogue of the exhibition. These promotional tools are essential to value the artistic quality of the work by our artists. Your help is much appreciated.
Ce titre Espace habité / inhabited space fait référence à la provenance géographique et à l’expression culturelle commune des artistes sélectionnées, chacune cependant avec son espace créatif distinct.  Le langage plastique des œuvres démontre la richesse et la diversité issues d’une région perçue parfois éloignée et habituellement illustrée d’images fantasmées d’espaces infinis et sauvages. Les intentions artistiques référent avant tout au regard que chacune pose sur son entourage, sur des préoccupations environnementales, sociales parfois politiques, personnelles, bref des thématiques universelles. 
Espace habité / Inhabited Space refers both to their geographical origin and to their share of a common practice, but also to how each of them have invested a very personal and distinctive creative space.  The diversity of their plastic language sheds light on the richness of a region often perceived as remote and fantasized as wild and distant lands. As to their artistic intent, it refers to how they perceive the world and relate to environmental, social, political or personal issues.
Mais avec ironie ou humour, et un goût prononcé pour la couleur, de nombreuses œuvres partagent un élan de vitalité audacieux dans un contexte souvent austère et dramatique du bijou de création. Les bijoux animés de Magali Thibault Gobeil reflètent une personnalité flamboyante et gourmande, les créations d’Aurélie Guillaume racontent des histoires ludiques avec des personnages étranges et caricaturés haut en couleur. Plein d’humour et d’ironie,  les bijoux figuratifs ou narratifs de Silvie Altschuler sont construits de matériaux contraires tant dans leur consistance que dans leur valeur inhérente. Marie-Maude Brunet, utilisant des moules acquis d’autres joailliers a commencé une série ou la tête de mort, symbole de puissance, de culte et de mysticisme, est associée à des fleurs, symbole de vie. Le paradoxe se retrouve également chez d’autres artistes.  Juxtaposant bois flotté et plastique transformé, les broches d’Anne-Marie Rébillard évoquent ses préoccupations écologiques en associant les rejets naturels et humains.  De son côté, bien qu’utilisant des couleurs vives pour ses bijoux en porcelaine, Catherine Granche transcrit la transformation naturelle des aliments abandonnés sur nos comptoirs, comme des artefacts du quotidien. Marie-Ève G. Castonguay, Émilie Trudel et Gabrielle Desmarais, par des esthétiques, des compositions et des attitudes différentes proposent des visions de l’espace, de l’environnement, de la nature. Emilie Dell’Aniello évoque les tangibles interprétations du  contenant, une forme modelée en bronze recouverte de peinture acrylique, l’élément central de sa collection. Katia Martel, par ses des matières, bas nylon, dentelles, broderies, invite à un questionnement sur notre rapport à l’intime par le bijou. Catherine Sheedy explore dans ce groupe d’œuvres l’idée d’accéder à nos rêves par une proposition métaphorique des rêves d’Icare. Et dans un tout autre ordre d’approche, Anne-Sophie Vallée  questionne les mouvements et l’interaction avec le corps par des bijoux méticuleusement conçus et articulés.

They have galleries all over the world and are one of the best I’ve worked with in the 30+ years of my artistic career.</p><p>On Saturday June 17<sup>th</sup>, come rain or shine, my palette knife and I will be at the Carré d'Artistes gallery in the Tlaquepaque Arts &amp; Crafts Village. We'll be painting our hearts out.</p><p>In the next 8 weeks I have to finish 80 Arizona landscapes. Follow my <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/angiebrooksby/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">instagram feed</a> to see my progress. And please share.</p><p><strong>Finally I can tell you why going to Sedona is personally very important.</strong></p><p>Last summer when Carré d’artistes offered me a place in their gallery in Sedona I hesitated. I wasn’t sure I wanted to paint landscapes again. After 20+ years of painting Tuscany and then moving to Paris I’d developed a new series of urban paintings — cityscapes of contemporary NYC and Paris.</p><p>One day in my atelier, while I mulled over the idea of painting Arizona landscapes I began pulling books off my shelves. Can you imagine my surprise when a 1970’s copy of the magazine <i>Family Health</i> fell to the plank floor? I picked it up and saw that the mailing label was addressed to my great-grandmother. My great-grandmother lived close to  Sedona. </p><p>I have no idea how the magazine came to be on the shelf among all my journals and sketchbooks. Talk about a sign from the divine!</p><p>Without hesitation I dialed Carré d’artistes main office. Signs of Arizona have popped up everywhere since then. My mother-in-law talked to me about a writer from Arizona and while walking through Luxembourg gardens I literally tripped into a sign about the Grand Canyon.</p><p>It occurred to me later that my father was born 20 miles away, in Flagstaff, and I’ll have the chance to visit my roots, in a way… He died when I was 13 and I’ve never seen his grave. Now I can. So, <u>my personal mission</u> in going to Sedona is to visit, my grandmother’s and my father’s grave.</p><p>Several people offered to write testimonials for me.</p><p>More than anyone I want to thank to Catherine Baker Stetson <a href=""http://www.stetsonlaw.com/CatherineBakerStetson.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stetsonlaw.com</a> . She is not only an amazing person, but an art connoisseur who has supported many artists. She kindly took her precious time to write an endorsement. I am grateful for the trust she has shown me and for all the paintings she’s purchased to add to her vast collection.</p><p style=""margin-left:18.0pt;""><i>While many can paint beautiful Tuscan landscapes and the distinctive beauty and colors of the American Southwest, few of those can also capture evocative Parisian street scenes, and fewer still meet the challenge of finding and translating the beauty of old industrial Hudson River Valle towns such as Cold Spring Harbor, NY. Angie Brooksby’s ability to understand these different beauties is breath-taking to me. I cannot imagine Hudson River painters understanding the palette of Sedona, or the typical Italian landscape painter with the ability to adapt to the shapes and colors of a big city, yet Angie has a way not only of seeing the beauty in profoundly different places and faces but of communicating the various beauties delightfully and effortlessly.</i></p><p> </p><h2><strong>My goal...</strong></h2><h3><strong>To raise 750$ for my flights. </strong></h3><p>It would put me on cloud nine.</p><p> </p><p><u>My <strong>basic costs</strong> will be over <strong>2000$ for the four day trip</strong></u></p><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" height=""257"" width=""615""><tbody>

We are on our way!A big thank you to all my wonderful friends and fam who have contributed. My pallette knife and I are over joyed and deeply grateful for your help to make this dream come true. In Sedona my mission is to paint at the gallery on June 17th. I have a personal mission but I’ll tell you about that in a bit. This exhibition in Sedona, Arizona is my 4th with Carré d’artistes. If you've never heard of them, let’s just say I love working with them. They have galleries all over the world and are one of the best I’ve worked with in the 30+ years of my artistic career.On Saturday June 17th, come rain or shine, my palette knife and I will be at the Carré d'Artistes gallery in the Tlaquepaque Arts & Crafts Village. We'll be painting our hearts out.In the next 8 weeks I have to finish 80 Arizona landscapes. Follow my instagram feed to see my progress. And please share.Finally I can tell you why going to Sedona is personally very important.Last summer when Carré d’artistes offered me a place in their gallery in Sedona I hesitated. I wasn’t sure I wanted to paint landscapes again. After 20+ years of painting Tuscany and then moving to Paris I’d developed a new series of urban paintings — cityscapes of contemporary NYC and Paris.One day in my atelier, while I mulled over the idea of painting Arizona landscapes I began pulling books off my shelves. Can you imagine my surprise when a 1970’s copy of the magazine Family Health fell to the plank floor? I picked it up and saw that the mailing label was addressed to my great-grandmother. My great-grandmother lived close to  Sedona. I have no idea how the magazine came to be on the shelf among all my journals and sketchbooks. Talk about a sign from the divine!Without hesitation I dialed Carré d’artistes main office. Signs of Arizona have popped up everywhere since then. My mother-in-law talked to me about a writer from Arizona and while walking through Luxembourg gardens I literally tripped into a sign about the Grand Canyon.It occurred to me later that my father was born 20 miles away, in Flagstaff, and I’ll have the chance to visit my roots, in a way… He died when I was 13 and I’ve never seen his grave. Now I can. So, my personal mission in going to Sedona is to visit, my grandmother’s and my father’s grave.Several people offered to write testimonials for me.More than anyone I want to thank to Catherine Baker Stetson Stetsonlaw.com . She is not only an amazing person, but an art connoisseur who has supported many artists. She kindly took her precious time to write an endorsement. I am grateful for the trust she has shown me and for all the paintings she’s purchased to add to her vast collection.While many can paint beautiful Tuscan landscapes and the distinctive beauty and colors of the American Southwest, few of those can also capture evocative Parisian street scenes, and fewer still meet the challenge of finding and translating the beauty of old industrial Hudson River Valle towns such as Cold Spring Harbor, NY. Angie Brooksby’s ability to understand these different beauties is breath-taking to me. I cannot imagine Hudson River painters understanding the palette of Sedona, or the typical Italian landscape painter with the ability to adapt to the shapes and colors of a big city, yet Angie has a way not only of seeing the beauty in profoundly different places and faces but of communicating the various beauties delightfully and effortlessly. My goal...To raise 750$ for my flights. It would put me on cloud nine. My basic costs will be over 2000$ for the four day trip

That's where they have the Festival de Cinema Americain. Robert Redford has been there but I never saw him. My toes are in the freezing Atlantic as I look West. I swear I saw a flying Vespa. Here is what you can do and what you get.   Buy Me a Taco Lunch25$  Postcard sized Watercolor of a Sedona's magical Bell Rock—15 x 10cm  These postcards are drawn and painted by me on archival paper.   I’ll postmark them from Sedona, sent in an envelope, and I'll send them anywhere in the world with the words you choose in any language as long as you give me the words. Why not surprise a friend?  Delivery in June.Here is an example. All are individually drawn so there will be small differences.

 
18 Years ago Tony bought one of my watercolors when I worked at Piazzale Michelangelo as a street vendor in Florence, Italy. Two months ago he sent me this email so I asked him if I could quote him:Angie, I met you in Florence years ago. I was a teenager touring with a band ... anyway, I bought one of your paintings on the street for 15,000 lira because I loved it, and you were so beautiful. I look at it often to remember that time and place and you. Today, I don't know why, I thought I would go find you and tell you, after all these years. – tony- Website: http://thingsandflesh.com     (opens in new window)Each time I gaze at the tiny painting I have from you it makes me feel so free, just the way I felt wandering around Italy in 1992. Half the time I was lost :-) but all the time I felt I was discovering something, it was the thing I most desired, which was to be a songwriter.To be telling you how much it meant to me and still does, after so many years ...

Angie was thoroughly prepared, an excellent teacher, and extremely encouraging. Although none of us were experienced painters, and had never painted en plein air, Angie gave us structure to start painting, support and tips when we got stuck, and just the right amount of design and color theory. It was a joy to spend that afternoon with Angie, and I’ve followed her career ever since. That afternoon inspired me to continue painting. I hope to be able to paint with Angie again.

Delivery in July....A special thank you to Mario Cappelletti of La Bottega in Castellina in Chianti, Italy for the kind words he offered when I asked him to write something for my campaign.  As a Tuscan art gallery that represents and exports the work of several local artists, we can only speak well of Angie Brooksby. We have collaborated with her for more than 10 years. Her paintings speak freshly of the warm light in which we live. Indeed looking at Angie’s paintings we have the impression of seeing light. We have followed her very personal evolution as a painter. We have seen her jump from the countryside to the city of light… all this whiles smoothly building our professional and human relationship.Where to follow me:My websiteinstagramFacebookCarre d'artistesHere I am in my atelier in Paris with some of the larger paintings that will be for sale at the gallery.___________________________________________Today is May 4th.

<p>I’ve been accepted as one of the Artists-in-Residence at the Vermont Studio
Center during their February 2016 session. I will be there for four weeks,
living, making art, and meeting fellow artists in Johnson, Vermont (while
trying to stay warm!). </p>
<p>Some of you might not
know what it means to be an “artist-in-residence” and how beneficial it is throughout
an artist’s career. All residencies offer something a little different but essentially
they give artists (and other creative types) time and space for reflection,
research, and to make work that they wouldn’t normally try in their usual
environment. It is an opportunity to explore and experiment with your practice
while meeting new people (internationally and from around the country) and
trying new materials, all while engaging in meaningful cultural exchange and
critical thinking. At the Vermont Studio Center, I will be given a place to
live, a studio to use whenever I want, and be fed daily (yay!). </p>
<p>As you can imagine for
an opportunity this wonderful, it doesn’t come free. I did receive an artist
grant and work exchange to help compensate for the tuition, however, I will
need to come up with the remainder of the tuition, the flight and materials
cost, plus rent for my apartment in San Francisco that I am unable to
sublet.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Instead of asking for
donations, I have set up a fundraiser for people to purchase different art
pieces, artist books, small paintings, and a postal notebook that will be sent
from Vermont. All of the proceeds will go <i>directly</i>
to helping me fund my residency! </p>

unique, one-of-a-kind drawing sketchbooks that are handmade by a local artist,

<h1><b>We're C.U.T.E!</b></h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p>C.U.T.E. is a collaborative that draws on our mutual background in sculpture and social anxiety. Our work situates itself in the intersection of Social Practice, interactive art, and Relational Aesthetics, and counters art that we perceive as inaccessible. Our work assumes that people are fearful, because we are.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>We assume that people want intimacy, and are lacking it.<br/>
</li>
<li>We assume that people don't know how to approach each other, but want to.<br/>
</li>
<li>We assume that, given the permission and proper framework, people will be eager to know each other.<br/>
</li>
<li>We assume that something good comes from the practice of becoming intimate with people.<br/>
</li>
<li>We assume that intimacy is something to be sought after.<br/>
</li>
<li>We assume that if a person isn't seeking intimacy, it is because they already have ""enough"".<br/>
</li>
<li>We assume that the only reason people wouldn't seek intimacy is fear.<br/>
</li>
<li>We assume that there are environments, processes, and objects that we can create to quiet, distract from, and fool fear.<br/>
</li>
<li>We assume that we are providing a needed service.<br/>

<h4>       C.U.T.E.</h4>
<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></div>","We're C.U.T.E!

C.U.T.E. is a collaborative that draws on our mutual background in sculpture and social anxiety. Our work situates itself in the intersection of Social Practice, interactive art, and Relational Aesthetics, and counters art that we perceive as inaccessible. Our work assumes that people are fearful, because we are.



We assume that people want intimacy, and are lacking it.

We assume that people don't know how to approach each other, but want to.

We assume that, given the permission and proper framework, people will be eager to know each other.

We assume that something good comes from the practice of becoming intimate with people.

We assume that intimacy is something to be sought after.

We assume that if a person isn't seeking intimacy, it is because they already have ""enough"".

We assume that the only reason people wouldn't seek intimacy is fear.

We assume that there are environments, processes, and objects that we can create to quiet, distract from, and fool fear.

We assume that we are providing a needed service.

teacher.</p>
<p>In
the 1980s I brought the Butoh-dance to Europe. 
</p>
<p>I've
created more than fifty solo and company pieces and also worked with
many companies as a guest choreographer. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">My
pieces are being shown all over the world: in Europe, in South &amp; North
America, in Arab Countries and in Japan.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>During
the last twenty years I've developed <span style=""font-size: 20px;"">the Seki Method</span>
– a dance training and a self-care method. 
</p>
<p><span>The
Seki Method</span> is based on principles of physics and biology, and their
transformation into the dancing body. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Perception
and imagination are likewise important aspects of this work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The
Seki Method is both rooted in Japanese tradition I grew up with, and
verified by the recent somatic and neuroscientific research.</p><p>Together with my <span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Power Team</span> we are pursuing the dream to give the Seki Method a home, to cultivate it, to develop it and to pass it on.</p><p></p>

</p><p>Minako's inspiration is a daily routine of Zen-Monks. She and her students has experienced the
deep impact the morning ritual – getting up early, keeping silence,
cleaning the space, meditation and Qigong – has on our lives and
our creative process. </p><p>Our awareness and our connectedness are
expanding. The art we are creating, is gaining depth and beauty as
well as profound social and political dimension.</p><p><br/></p>

</p><p>Everyone
interested in combing art and a holistic way of life shall find a

with your help we've raised $ 5822! Thank you very much for your contributions and your constant support during the campaign! 
We will use the money and the rich treasure of experience we've collected during the last 3 month to kick start our project. We will keep you updated about every progress and we hope to welcome you soon as guests and co-operators of the Seki Method Center!
Thank you!!! ありがとう！



Who are we?Minako Seki:I am a Berlin-based, Japan-born dancer, choreographer and
teacher.
In
the 1980s I brought the Butoh-dance to Europe. 

I've
created more than fifty solo and company pieces and also worked with
many companies as a guest choreographer. My
pieces are being shown all over the world: in Europe, in South & North
America, in Arab Countries and in Japan.

During
the last twenty years I've developed the Seki Method
– a dance training and a self-care method. 

The
Seki Method is based on principles of physics and biology, and their
transformation into the dancing body. Perception
and imagination are likewise important aspects of this work.

The
Seki Method is both rooted in Japanese tradition I grew up with, and
verified by the recent somatic and neuroscientific research.Together with my Power Team we are pursuing the dream to give the Seki Method a home, to cultivate it, to develop it and to pass it on.

Our Vision, our MissionOur goal is to create an open and dynamic performing arts center aspiring
towards a new balance between
Art,
Science, Philosophy, Healing, Nutrition and
Spirituality.

It
will gather under one roof:
Dance,
Performance, Qigong, Meditation, traditional
Japanese
Treatments and
healthy
Cooking.The Seki Method Center is dedicated to performing arts in holistic vision. At the same time it is sharing tools for life.

Minako's inspiration is a daily routine of Zen-Monks. She and her students has experienced the
deep impact the morning ritual – getting up early, keeping silence,
cleaning the space, meditation and Qigong – has on our lives and
our creative process. Our awareness and our connectedness are
expanding. The art we are creating, is gaining depth and beauty as
well as profound social and political dimension.
Who can benefit from the Seki Method Center?
Everyone
interested in combing art and a holistic way of life shall find a
space for creation, research and retreat in natural environment close
to Berlin. 
The Seki Method is beneficial for youngsters and seniors,for dancers, performers, artists, musicians,for health practitioners, therapists, nutrition experts,for teachers and social workers,for scientists and academicians …Everybody regardless of age, state of health and movement experience is able to get from the very first encounter with the Seki Method a unique gift:a lasting, solid foundation and some simple tools to continue the work on one own and to go further the path of self-care, self-healing, mindfulness, personal growth and creativity.

In
order to fulfill its mission,the Seki Method Center will



Host
	dance, movement and voice workshops, lectures and conferences for
	dialogue between art and science, performances, cooking classes,
	ceremonies and meditation retreats.


Provide
	space and other resources for art and science residencies to develop
	and stage new works while living and co-creating the special,
	respectful atmosphere of the Seki Method Center.


Provide
	space for meditation, self-care and self-healing and invite visitors
	to participate in the Seki Method as well as the daily routines of
	the Center.

As
a visitor of the Seki Method Center you will be able to experience:


Dance		to
find natural and physical principles in your body, to
reconnect and trust your instincts and to
unfold imagination and creativity

Meditation	for
learning to be in the Here and Now and becoming aware of your
			patterns


Healing		to
give time and tools to support your self-healing and
					detoxification

Macrobiotic Food		because
how you cook & eat influences the way you feel

</div></div>","Hi everyone! I’m Deborah Monaghan an artist/designer currently in Montana via Massachusetts and California. My need for funding is two fold. At the end of June, The Danforth Gallery in Livingston, Montana will be including my wallpaper and textiles in their show titled, Implement (where household objects and art collide). Alongside this, I will be launching a small business so I can continue to produce these pieces, sell them to the general public - and my hope is, make more! I have so many ideas for designs and the commercial viability is endless - I just need a leg up - or two.
For about the last decade I have been immersed in all things design, branding, marketing, project management and business operations. From art school to running a design/technology studio my experience has primed me for this venture. The ThinkBody website can be found at www.thinkbody.co  and here is my linkedin profile if you would like to learn more: www.linkedin.com/in/deborahmonaghan/  
 
 
 

 
 
ThinkBody is a response to the increasing cerebral world we live in as we spend more of our lives engaged within the virtual world of our screens. The patterns are based on and/or inspired by anatomy and systems of the body. Imagine having wallpaper or pillows in our homes or offices inspired by the way blood moves through our heart, or the visual design of our nervous system. Might these objects prompt us to leave the world of the screen and return not only to our physical body and senses, but also to the physical environment in which we find ourselves. This project has been a labor of love for over a year and a half now, and I am so excited to finally see these designs move from zany idea to objects of art people can use and enjoy in their homes.  
 

 
What We Need & What You Get
I am asking for funding of $4500.00 and here is a bit about how the designs get produced and where the money will go. 


ThinkBody is a collaborative effort that involves an extremely talented bunch of people found in the States (me), France (Imelda Picherit, colorist), and Ireland (Orlagh O’Brien, graphic designer). My forte is not working in the computer, so I take my sketches and ideas to my collaborators and together we turn them into computer generated designs ready for wallpaper and textiles. This process allows me to focus on what I am best at, dreaming up new patterns and concepts for new patterns, and tending to the production and business matters at hand. 
 
 

 
 
 
From there we move into the printing production which involves ordering test runs of both wallpaper and textiles, tweaking the scale of the patterns and the color as we go. And then we are off! and it’s time to print rolls of wallpaper and make pillows or towels (and whatever else I can dream up), or print fabric for upholstery. 
 
At this point, there is much infrastructure that I am working on that supports not only the gallery show, but the launch of ThinkBody as a small business. This includes postcard design and printing, copyrighting the patterns, getting a website together, packaging, production how-to’s moving forward, and pr and some computer equipment. For the June Danforth show I am producing pillows and two or three rolls of wallpaper - and maybe, just maybe, upholstering a chair. I am currently investigating working with local Montanan screen printers to produce wallpaper as well as seamstresses and leather workers to produce the pillows. I will be posting pictures of the samples as they come in along with other updates on the update portion of the campaign, so please be sure to check back regularly on my progress. 
 
 

 
 
After the campaign is successfully funded, all contributors will be listed on the ThinkBody website once it has launched and you will forever have my gratitude. Other perks include limited edition prints, pillows that are made by seamstresses in Montana and custom design work. Whether in print or textile form, these patterns are functional art pieces that encourage a reconnection to the body and the spaces we inhabit; though the world of the screen can be vast, deep and engaging, let’s not forget our senses, the tactile, and the charms of the human environment that surround us. 
 

 Lastly, dollars aren't the only way to contribute - spreading the word is just as valuable. Please share the campaign and help get the word out!

<h2><strong>A Fantastic Community Bike Mural!</strong></h2>
<p>This summer, help me (Danielle Fodor) paint a monument to cycling in the heart of downtown Davis, at the corner of 3rd and F Street. This will be the inaugural mural for my new public art project -- Paint Bike Fun, which involves children and communities in making great public art about cycling.</p>
<p><strong>This Bike Fun mural</strong> will be the first community-designed and painted mural in downtown Davis in over 10 years, and <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">the first and only mural about cycling in Davis</span></em><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">!</span></em></p>
<h3><strong>Location, Location: </strong></h3>
<p>The intersection of 3<sup>rd</sup> and F street is the heart of downtown Davis, known as the ""Bicycle Capital of America"". 3<sup>rd</sup> street is the main bicycle corridor that connects UC Davis campus with the city’s restaurants, cafes, and Davis Farmer’s Market. The wall, on the SW corner, is perfect, with architectural framing to make two wheel-shaped panels.</p>
<h3><strong>Why me? Why this project?</strong></h3>
<p>This project was born when my young son refused, for several months, to ride in his bike trailer. While in the car, he would talk about all the other ""race cars"" on the road, and begged us for ""Cars"" brand sunglasses and backpack. It made me think about all the powerful, fun images that children see about cars and trucks -- movies, books, clothing, TV shows, and more.  I wanted biking to be that FUN.  And I wanted to use the tools I knew -- working with kids and communities to paint great public art.</p>
<p>I have been painting community murals in Davis for about 8 years. I love to work with people to create vibrant images that showcase our values and collective imagination. Some of my murals can be seen in the UC Davis Arboretum and the Davis Art Center.</p>
<h3><strong>A Community-Driven Project: </strong></h3>
<p>This mural has included community input from the first moments. Davis children, youth, and grown-ups created nearly 200 art pieces about Bike Fun, in response to a public ""Call for Ideas"" and a free, public design workshop.  I did the final studio work, putting everything together and coloring it in.</p>
<p>Painting is also a community endeavor.  I have been painting for 5 weeks (July &amp; August) and invitde the community to continue participating by joining me on a paint days, 5 days a week. Our painters are a wide variety of people -- children, adults, teens, professionals, retirees, students, unemployed folks.  The wall is a place for people to meet and work together as equals.   Get project updates at: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/paintbikefun"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/paintbikefun.</a> Email me for volunteer info: <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">paintbikefun@gmail.com</a></p>
<h3>Send some money! Get cool stuff!</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>This mural is happening!</strong> This mural has received amazing support from grants, the City of Davis, and local organizations that has paid for the original materials, printing, and the bulk of our costs. But we need a little more...</p>
<p><strong>My fundraising goal is $2500.</strong>  This money will fill a gap to pay for the mural's equipment(signage, safety cones), materials (extra paintbrushes &amp; palettes), and a small portion of my labor (4 months of participatory design, teaching painting, training volunteers, and doing community outreach), as well as for permits for the street party that we will hold on August 17th, to celebrate the mural's completion.</p>
<p><strong>I will give you awesome stuff for your donation!</strong><strong> </strong>Beautiful, high quality art greeting cards, a stylish bike coloring book, and/or a high-quality print of the mural.  If you give a lot of money, you could get your name on the mural plaque, or pick a piece of art from my studio!</p>
<h3><strong>Tell your friends!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Share this project with your friends to help us reach our goal. It's exciting!<strong> <br/></strong>

<h3> </h3></div>","Davis has a lot of murals.  Davis has a lot of bikes.  But Davis is missing one thing....
A Fantastic Community Bike Mural!
This summer, help me (Danielle Fodor) paint a monument to cycling in the heart of downtown Davis, at the corner of 3rd and F Street. This will be the inaugural mural for my new public art project -- Paint Bike Fun, which involves children and communities in making great public art about cycling.
This Bike Fun mural will be the first community-designed and painted mural in downtown Davis in over 10 years, and the first and only mural about cycling in Davis!
Location, Location: 
The intersection of 3rd and F street is the heart of downtown Davis, known as the ""Bicycle Capital of America"". 3rd street is the main bicycle corridor that connects UC Davis campus with the city’s restaurants, cafes, and Davis Farmer’s Market. The wall, on the SW corner, is perfect, with architectural framing to make two wheel-shaped panels.
Why me? Why this project?
This project was born when my young son refused, for several months, to ride in his bike trailer. While in the car, he would talk about all the other ""race cars"" on the road, and begged us for ""Cars"" brand sunglasses and backpack. It made me think about all the powerful, fun images that children see about cars and trucks -- movies, books, clothing, TV shows, and more.  I wanted biking to be that FUN.  And I wanted to use the tools I knew -- working with kids and communities to paint great public art.
I have been painting community murals in Davis for about 8 years. I love to work with people to create vibrant images that showcase our values and collective imagination. Some of my murals can be seen in the UC Davis Arboretum and the Davis Art Center.
A Community-Driven Project: 
This mural has included community input from the first moments. Davis children, youth, and grown-ups created nearly 200 art pieces about Bike Fun, in response to a public ""Call for Ideas"" and a free, public design workshop.  I did the final studio work, putting everything together and coloring it in.
Painting is also a community endeavor.  I have been painting for 5 weeks (July & August) and invitde the community to continue participating by joining me on a paint days, 5 days a week. Our painters are a wide variety of people -- children, adults, teens, professionals, retirees, students, unemployed folks.  The wall is a place for people to meet and work together as equals.   Get project updates at: www.facebook.com/paintbikefun. Email me for volunteer info: paintbikefun@gmail.com
Send some money! Get cool stuff!

This mural is happening! This mural has received amazing support from grants, the City of Davis, and local organizations that has paid for the original materials, printing, and the bulk of our costs. But we need a little more...
My fundraising goal is $2500.  This money will fill a gap to pay for the mural's equipment(signage, safety cones), materials (extra paintbrushes & palettes), and a small portion of my labor (4 months of participatory design, teaching painting, training volunteers, and doing community outreach), as well as for permits for the street party that we will hold on August 17th, to celebrate the mural's completion.
I will give you awesome stuff for your donation! Beautiful, high quality art greeting cards, a stylish bike coloring book, and/or a high-quality print of the mural.  If you give a lot of money, you could get your name on the mural plaque, or pick a piece of art from my studio!
Tell your friends!

Share this project with your friends to help us reach our goal. It's exciting! 



If you give me more money, I'll paint more Bike Murals!
The Davis Bike Fun mural is the first in a series of mural installations that I am planning for cities throughout California, called Paint Bike Fun. Paint Bike Fun is a multi-city public art initiative that promotes cycling by creating large-scale public art that brands cycling as magical, joyful, and fun, especially for children and youth who are the transportation decision makers of tomorrow.

<h3>The Short of It</h3>
<p>We are a handful of Austin-based illustrators looking to put together a coloring book for children. Rather than illustrate the same tired old characters, monsters, and myths, we've decided to flex our imaginations and create some new ones. Our goals can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>We want to inspire kids to create. We grew up drawing Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolf Man, and we firmly believe that there’s a special magic when a child discovers a new monster. This coloring book harkens back to the days when we first started drawing - when we scribbled just to explore the furthest reaches of our creativity. We’d like to help ignite that spirit of discovery in the next generation of kids.</span></li>
<li><span>We want to make something beautiful. It isn’t easy for young illustrators to find a platform for their work, and we want to start sharing our skills with the world. Whether you’re going to color in the book or not, we want you to be able to enjoy just flipping through the pages.</span></li>
<li><span>We want to test the waters of self-publishing content for children. If we find success, this coloring book will only be the beginning of a whole new storybook world full of adventure and discovery. A broader children’s magazine is already in the works... but we have to make this coloring book a big hit first!</span></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Getting this project off the ground requires us to get that first batch of coloring books mailed in from the printer. We can’t wait to open the box full of fresh, shiny coloring books, and every contribution from people like you gets us a little bit closer to that moment!</p>
<p>The actual hard item you’re funding is an 8,5” x 5.5”, 24-page coloring book, packed full with the imaginative work of great young artists. Every bit of funding will shorten the length between that imaginative work and the finished product. If our campaign reaches the full goal of $500, we’ll be able to print enough copies to start shipping out in full force! But even if we don’t quite make it all the way to our goal, every contribution - no matter how small - will help make this dream a reality even sooner.</p>
<p>What do you get out of it? Well, look to the right for a list of all the great rewards you can receive for your donation. But even beyond the prizes...</p>
<ul>
<li>You will help to create something that is certifiably awesome, something that inspires kids to create and start building out-of-the-box creative thinking skills.</li>
<li>You will give a group of recently-graduated illustrators a chance to share their work.</li>

<h3>Our Story<br/>
</h3>
<p>We are excited that Lauren will graduate from college on May 8, 2011. She has worked hard in pursuing her studies in art and art therapy, and her family celebrates her achievement. As she has moved through her college experience, it has been fun to watch her discover her abilities. Lauren is a bright young adult with a promising future. We support her love of art and want to help her continue to grow in her artistic skills.<br/></p>
<p>Recently her mom Jamie and step-dad Bill visited New England. Passing through the quaint town of Grafton, Vermont, they stopped by a working blacksmith shop. Adam Howard is a master blacksmith who teaches people how to do his historical art. He provides week-long residencies for artists and craftsmen to show them how to work the forge and anvil. To learn more about his work, <a href=""http://www.windham-foundation.org/programs/blacksmith.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""click here"">click here.</a><br/></p>
<p>Lauren was excited to hear about this learning opportunity, but her face fell when she heard the price. She is a college senior, after all, looking at loan repayments and the start-up costs of getting out on her own. Bill and Jamie would love to send her to Grafton Forge, but with two other kids in college, this seems like an ""extra"" expense that they simply can't meet in its entirety.</p>
<p>But what if we were able to ask you to help out? Have you ever wanted to encourage a young adult to reach for her dreams? That's what we hope to do: to send Lauren to Blacksmith Camp on May 21-27, 2011.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every gift and donation will be helpful. These are tight times for many families, and young adults are feeling the financial pinch more than many. This is especially true for young artists, who learn quickly that other people do not immediately value their work. </p>
<p>Therefore the greatest impact of this campaign is <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">encouragement</span>. Through your gifts, you are able to assist a young artist in developing her skills. <br/></p>
<p>Sure, we can encourage her with words. But if we send her to this camp, we can make our encouragement into a tangible experience that will shape her life for many years to come.</p>
<p>Plus - and this needs to be said - she will learn how to make really cool iron sculptures that could end up on your front lawn . . . or in a famous museum!<br/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The total cost for the one-week residency at Grafton will be about 
$1000. This covers tuition (500), room and board (400), and gas money 
(100). Her immediate family will make an initial gift, and we are inviting friends and other members of the family to pitch in as they are able. <br/></p>
<p>As you might know, it can difficult to pick out a gift for Lauren. She lives modestly and never wants to put people out. Jamie and Bill want to lead the effort to do something special for this extraordinary young woman. We think this is a fresh and fun idea with lots of practical benefits for Lauren.<br/></p>
<p>While every gift is important, we want to provide special premiums for those who can help us out. Please be sure to note the perks provided by Lauren's family. Everyone in the household will be helping out in some way. The family is offering special perks for special donations. Can you help support this dream?</p>
<p>We invite you to make an online gift through this IndieGoGo site. If you wish to contribute by cash or check, you can send the contribution to her at her home address.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread the word about this cool idea. There are tools on this site to share the campaign with others.  You can send a special e-mail, post a click-to picture, or post this on your Facebook page. Thanks for telling others about this opportunity. Together we can send Lauren to Blacksmith Camp.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Catch the Bus is the dream of two artists to create a Mobile, Sustainable way of existing and bringing Art to the world.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Our plan is to obtain a  school bus to renovate into a mobile live-in studio. We believe that art and ideas should be shared.  The digital realm provides a platform on which to share and communicate which is unprecedented, but is a supplement not a replacement for human contact.  In search of this human contact, we embrace a nomadic life of constantly sharing and being shared with.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In this age, we are all aware that some resources are finite, while others are constantly renewable.

At the same time, we respect that the power for that technology needs to come from sustainable sources; we plan to power everything from the lightbulbs to the tablets with solar and wind energy.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid--d2575b1-1784-1168-2bb0-90d5eb3881a4""><span>As we travel throughout the country, everyone who gets to Catch the Bus will get to share in the process of artistic creation and observe a fully-functioning example of a modern, sustainable existence that they may take away ideas of what is within reach. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $12,000 to get and renovate the bus.  That may seem like a lot, but if only 120 people give $100, we will have met our goal!  Literally every dollar counts.  </p>
<p>The money will be used for:</p>
<p>A SCHOOL BUS - $3,500 </p>
<p>POWER - $3000 - Solar panels, Wind generator, Deep cycle batteries, Inverter, Controller</p>
<p>WATER - $1,500 - Rain collector, Filtration, Piping, Grey water collector</p>
<p>SPACE - $2,000 -  Renovation, Smart-system, Compost toilet</p>
<p>MOVEMENT - $1,000 - Biodiesel mixing station, Vespa</p>
<p>FACADE - $1,000 - Exterior Paint, Interior Details, Cockpit</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Catch the Bus will be a mobile showcase of a sustainable existence.  Obviously, not everyone wants to live in a bus, but the ideas and solutions that we use, find, and develop will be transferable to every day living in a technlogical age.  The Bus will be a touring showcase of those ideas and solutions.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the things I have enjoyed on my travels is meeting those people who have never traveled more than 50 miles from where they were born.  Their unique view on life and space is always an inspiration.  Catch the Bus will bring art, our art and the art of others across the country, to those people in a way they might never see otherwise. </p>

<p><strong>Who is Michael Lafrance Lynch? I am an artist who believes that art represents</strong></p>
<p><strong>spiritalism that reaches the core of human beings.... also I feel that art is ess</strong><strong>ential to people's lives. Recently I was selected in The Bombay Sapphire / Russell Simmons' Artisan Series Competition Search aimed at discovering The</strong><strong>Next Big Name in visual arts! Out of 4,500 submits, I was selected one of the </strong><strong>twelve nation's most imaginative artist in Miami's famed Art Basel, which is the largest art exhibition in America!</strong></p>
<p><strong>In pursuing my philanthropic goals my company LAFRANCE (The Visual) ARTS </strong><strong>main agenda is to help the homeless, each piece of artwork that is purchased, 40% of the  sell of this artwork is donated to a selected homeless shelter ( Joy</strong><strong>Junction) and food bank (Road Runner Food Bank). I was homeless for two </strong><strong>years , and have a deep passion for anyone in this situation. With your con</strong><strong>tribution... you DO 'uplift' the gifts... the creativity of artist (his work) and the </strong><strong>gift of giving and helping people who are less fortunate. I need $3,500.00, 1/2 </strong><strong>will go to the artist supplies to create artwork, the other half will be available </strong><strong>funds to give to foodbank and homeless shelter as pre-pledges and set up the </strong><strong>funding between my company and these entities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The perks from your contribution would be a great  gift !!! For $25.00 a </strong><strong>(12x18 print )/$50.00-$100.00 ( 20x30 print) of selected artworks will be sent to you for your thoughtful gift of giving!!! If my goals are'nt met ..

When you help people to </strong><strong>become self sustaining, their lives may start as blank canvas, but with our help we can create a masterpiece</strong><strong> for all the world to see.

This FEB. 26, 2013 .. I made a donation of  2 works of my art.. to THE ROAD RUNNER FOOD BANK.

<h1>Help us Share Our Story</h1>
<p>We believe that artists have a skill. We also believe that making a living as an artist is hard--especially in the beginning. We feel that the economics of artwork, as they are currently setup (galleries, etc.), do not encourage and support artists of all types. If we can meet our goal, we want to foster and allow artists to make a living using their skill through completing our website--while still leaving the creativity in their hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Finishing The Website</h1>
<p>If we reach our goal, we will finish and launch the site. The idea for the website is simple:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Select Your Artist </strong>- You can choose your artist by browsing their examples. Filter the artists based on a particular style or feel.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Upload Your Photo</strong> - Upload a picture of yourself, your friend, a family member, or even your fish! You can upload a picture from your computer, from a web link, and from your and your friend's Google+ and Facebook albums.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Socialize and Enjoy</strong> - After checkout, your artist begins drawing your picture in their unique style. Once drawn, the artist is paid for their time and talent and your drawing is available to download or placed right back into a Facebook album.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>The Pledges</h1>
<p><strong>After contributing, we will contact you via email to get your photo and artist choice.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>1 to 6 Faces</strong> - Pledges are straight forward: how many faces do you want drawn? Then you get to decide how and who draws those faces by selecting one or more of our artists.</p>
<p>If you pledge 4 faces, you can have a picture of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yourself drawn by 4 artists (1x4)</li>
<li>You and your best friend drawn by 2 artists (2x2)</li>
<li>You in one photo and three of your friends in another by 1 artist (4x1)</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul><p>You choose the combination!</p>
<p><strong>Be the Model</strong> - <a href=""http://player.vimeo.com/video/61375730"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Watch our video</a> about the website. As artists join the site, they will draw from our sample photos (like the one you already see). Artists will draw the samples in order from left to right (important to know).</p>
<p>In the last month, we have had our sample photo drawn by about a dozen artists. The prospect of having dozens, maybe even a hundred artists drawing our photo is an exciting idea as art fans--which is why we put in this pledge. You could be drawn by the next Picasso!<br/> </p>

canvases....solved that problem as well with the drawstring and lock closure at 
the back...one size of my portfolio bags, fit a few different sizes of canvases. 
Load from the back.. Now it had to be cost effective, affordable... they are..as 
each one can hold 1-3 canvases, gallery or exhibition size because of the two 
inside lightly padded areas. Now, they had to be fast, and easy to use, well 
they are that too, because you can load and protect 1-3 canvases, even the 
largest sizes, in less than 3 minutes. That is huge ! I remember the last show I 
did, I loaded up 8 large 36"" x 48"" x 1.5"" canvases in just 3 of my Masterpiece To Go Art Portfolios,  and was driving

sack the size of a ladies handbag.</p>
<p>*ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY....stop throwing away shrink wrap, bubble wrap and plastic bags, 
washing sheets. </p>
<p>*************</p><p>TESTIMONIALS YOU ASK ?  </p><p></p><p>Here 
are a few that will be on the sides of the store 
floor displays.</p>
<p><br/><u>~Denise 
Williams:</u></p>
<p>“Any artist who has ever packed, transported or stored art 
knows the risks involved. I could go on for pages talking about all the things 
that have happened over the years, the endless hours ...of touch-ups resulting from needless accidents, but If 
you’re looking at this, you know.<br/>When I first saw the Grab &amp; Go Bags, I 
was astounded by the elegant design and ease of use. Now we all know an artist 
never packs art unless they have to, but I was so excited by these bags, that 
not only did I pack the right size canvases for the bag in a matter of minutes, 
from start to finish, but I was literally compelled to repack smaller works 
multiple times simply to see how well it worked. All so simple. As the 
experience was so delightful, I became over zealous and literally slide the bag 
all over the floor to see what would happen. The works stayed in place.<br/>I 
became more excited and actually put them in the back of my car for a test 
drive. For the first time in my life while transporting art I did not have to 
drive like I had loose eggs in the car praying I would not have to brake fast. I 
found myself driving normally and then decided to take some dirt roads. Next 
thing, I was driving as though I was in a hurry over the rough dirt roads in 
Santa Fe, New Mexico.<br/>When I got home, I went one step further and tossed the 
bag down in the snow. I admit, I did that. Can you imagine that? When I got 
inside and opened the bag, all pieces were safe and securely in place!<br/>The 
following ritual of gratitude to artist Debra Blade for inventing these bags you 
will have to experience yourself. I cannot say enough about them. I cannot 
imagine the art world without the Masterpiece To Go canvas portfolio cases, aka 
Grab &amp; Go bags. I believe all the great masters are tipping their hats to

<p>“I find this 
canvas protector a lightweight, durable, quick and convenient way to transport 
artwork. It not only looks clean and professional when delivering art to a 
customer, it is easy to wrap and unwrap. No more taping up the paper wrapping or 
cloth around the work and dealing with the mess or disposal of the packing 
afterwards. It’s a green way to go and it’s great that one cover will work for 
up to 3 paintings! “<br/><a href=""http://www.jeanettejarville.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.jeanettejarville.com/</a></p><p>**********************</p>

masterpiece,..time to prepare it for transport to your art show, to be scanned, 
or delivering it to your client. You have a choice of bubble wrap, shrink wrap, 
bed sheets, foam sheets, blankets, cardboard and plastic bags..or any 
combination of these. All of these are clumsy, wasteful, time consuming, 
costly, dangerous to your valued originals,  and unprofessional. One question, 
Are you tired of looking and feeling unprofessional with this method ? I was. I 
checked everywhere for a solution, I asked many seasoned artists..there simply 
wasn't anything out there. So I decided to change that.My name is Debra Blades, I am a Fine Art, Gold, Silver and  Copper leaf Abstract artist from BC. Using hand made papers from around the world as well as acrylic, these metals, of gold silver or copper has a very subtle effect that is burnished with the paint, and is very reflective, especially when the lights hit them, causing them to 'glow' from within. I usually work on medium to larger  canvases. This one is ""HEY JUDE"" my signature piece..most of my work is named after The Beatles songs..as it is their music that has most inspired me..don't worry, there is no copyright on song titles.My problem of transporting my original  canvas pieces was a nightmare to me, I knew other artists were having the same problem, that after trying endlessly to find  something and couldn't, I came up with a design that solves this need. 'MASTERPIECE TO GO' adjustable, professional Art 
Portfolios was born ! ""Grab and Go' came about because most artists would tell 
me.. “I am a grab and go kinda of person”..so the handles were never made as 
part of each bag, but as an OPTION, an adjustable, detachable handle, sold 
separately.'Grab and Go' came about because most artists would tell me.. “I am a grab and 
go kinda of person”..so the handles were never made as part of each bag, but as 
an OPTION, an adjustable, detachable handle, sold separately.First it had to have to ability to hold the 
various shapes of canvases, SQUARE, RECTANGLE, and OBLONG..okay..fixed that..as 
I have these three shapes...then also the different sizes...well because there 
are so many sizes..I knew it had to be adjustable, to fit an assortment of 
canvases....solved that problem as well with the drawstring and lock closure at 
the back...one size of my portfolio bags, fit a few different sizes of canvases. 
Load from the back.. Now it had to be cost effective, affordable... they are..as 
each one can hold 1-3 canvases, gallery or exhibition size because of the two 
inside lightly padded areas. Now, they had to be fast, and easy to use, well 
they are that too, because you can load and protect 1-3 canvases, even the 
largest sizes, in less than 3 minutes. That is huge ! I remember the last show I 
did, I loaded up 8 large 36"" x 48"" x 1.5"" canvases in just 3 of my Masterpiece To Go Art Portfolios,  and was driving 
away in my van with them within 15 MINUTES. They were stacked easily, without 
fear of scratching or damaging my valued originals.  Remember, when you handle your artwork with care, people will believe it has 
value.****************************
As artists, we have portfolios for our 
proofs or our prints, all of which can be replaced if damage 
occurs, but what if one of our originals gets a scratch or a scuff..how much 
time and effort is needed to repair this..it is enough to make you physically 
sick when you damage an original.. Another thing I like to consider is, as music 
is art, imagine a violinist arriving at the concert with her instrument wrapped 
in bubble wrap and a plastic bag. It's not ever likely to ever 
happen.Masterpiece To Go Portfolios was 
recently used in the 2013 Calgary Floods  http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/news/calgary-flooding/  to transport a lot of very valuable art, for collectors and galleries, 
as one of the testimonials below describes.**********Masterpiece To Go Art 
Portfolios, is PATENT PENDING, and is available in SQUARE, RECTANGLE, AND 
OBLONG, and each shape is in S-M, M-L, AND L-XL.
My purpose for this 
campaign is to:*Replenish my stock,*Add a couple new sizes,  *Add new 
designs I have in the making.*Advertising and Trade show Fees.
*Administration fees.* Rental of a storage unit.
*Extra staff.*The floor display stands, (that will be  professionally wrapped with all the information, instructions, and testimonials  for a dramatic statement in the stores.)
************MASTERPIECE TO GO 
PORTFOLIOS is a product that has all these features:
*LIGHTWEIGHT..made 
of Rainfly fabric, the lightest, and strongest fabric used by the most 
experienced of back packers.
*DURABLE...will 
withstand years of normal use.
*QUICK AND 
EASY....you can load and protect 1-3 canvases in less than 3 
minutes.
*PULL AND LOCK 
CLOSURE...adjusts to allow your originals to be safe and secure for transport or 
storage.
*2 LIGHTWEIGHT 
INSIDE PADDED AREAS...to protect from rubs or scratches.
*WATER RESISTANT 
FABRIC....same as backpackers require.
*EACH WILL HOLD 1-3 
CANVASES....very cost effective, and time saving.
*ADJUSTABLE TO 3 
SIZES....each can gather down to a smaller size.
*SEPARATE STUFF 
SACK...when not in use each portfolio will fit nicely away in it’s own stuff 
sack the size of a ladies handbag.
*ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY....stop throwing away shrink wrap, bubble wrap and plastic bags, 
washing sheets. 
*************TESTIMONIALS YOU ASK ?  Here 
are a few that will be on the sides of the store 
floor displays.
~Denise 
Williams:
“Any artist who has ever packed, transported or stored art 
knows the risks involved. I could go on for pages talking about all the things 
that have happened over the years, the endless hours ...of touch-ups resulting from needless accidents, but If 
you’re looking at this, you know.When I first saw the Grab & Go Bags, I 
was astounded by the elegant design and ease of use. Now we all know an artist 
never packs art unless they have to, but I was so excited by these bags, that 
not only did I pack the right size canvases for the bag in a matter of minutes, 
from start to finish, but I was literally compelled to repack smaller works 
multiple times simply to see how well it worked. All so simple. As the 
experience was so delightful, I became over zealous and literally slide the bag 
all over the floor to see what would happen. The works stayed in place.I 
became more excited and actually put them in the back of my car for a test 
drive. For the first time in my life while transporting art I did not have to 
drive like I had loose eggs in the car praying I would not have to brake fast. I 
found myself driving normally and then decided to take some dirt roads. Next 
thing, I was driving as though I was in a hurry over the rough dirt roads in 
Santa Fe, New Mexico.When I got home, I went one step further and tossed the 
bag down in the snow. I admit, I did that. Can you imagine that? When I got 
inside and opened the bag, all pieces were safe and securely in place!The 
following ritual of gratitude to artist Debra Blade for inventing these bags you 
will have to experience yourself. I cannot say enough about them. I cannot 
imagine the art world without the Masterpiece To Go canvas portfolio cases, aka 
Grab & Go bags. I believe all the great masters are tipping their hats to 
Debra Blades for honouring the art world in such a way. Find out yourself.~

film. La version finale du film a ensuite été reconstruite en connexion 
avec un de ces morceaux. La relation musique/image est poussée au-delà du
 travail de composition de musique originale pour un film et au-delà du 
clip accompagnant un morceau. Les deux parties établissent un jeu de correspondances, plutôt qu'elles ne s'accompagnent.Pendant six heures le vendredi  18 juillet, des artistes exploreront en direct la relation entre musique et image animée.Nous voulons poursuivre
 cette expérimentation en présentant le travail d'autres jeunes artistes ayant 
un même commun intérêt pour la musique et l'image animée, puis en 
ouvrant cette exploration à l'expérience du direct avec des dessins et des montages vidéos
réalisés pendant des performances musicales. Nous invitons  des 
réalisateurs à diffuser leurs court-métrages choisis pour leur force 
visuelle évocatrice et nous offrirons au spectateur une expérience en 
direct des rencontres hasardeuses entre musique et filmsDe par sa nature événementielle, ce projet propose de 
donner accès à des objets filmiques hors de l'immersion passive de la 
salle obscure mais également d'inscrire la pratique plastique dans le 
temps et le direct. De nombreuses oeuvres présentées seront fixées, la plupart subiront une 
transformation en direct, seront interprétées en direct ou seront 
simplement créées en direct.Teaser de l'album The Lady with the monkey video par Guillaume Aventurin
LE 18 JUILLET DE 17h à 23h, AUX FRIGOS, PARIS
13eProduite par l'association NEMNI, notre exposition prend de l'ampleur et nous
avons besoin de votre aide pour achever sa création.
En trois semaines seulement, nous avons rallié
plus de vingt jeunes artistes plastiques, cinéastes et musiciens. Ainsi que :* 100m2 d’espace d’exposition* 3 heures de vidéos et de
films* 2 heures de musique live
* 2 heures de performances visuelles 
* 6 heures d'installations électro-acoustiquesEt
puisque nous aimons les risques et les innovations, ‘Variations’ inaugurera le ‘piano vidéaste’. Travaillant autour du 
logiciel  MAX, cette installation ‘vidéo-acoustique' donne au public un accès ludique 
à la création artistique…Tout ce qui nous manque maintenant, c’est une
aide financière. La date du 18 juillet approche et c’est vers vous que nous
nous tournons ! Il nous faut 1500€ au minimum pour que le projet voie le jour. Bien sûr, afin qu'il se fasse dans les meilleures conditions, artistiques, techniques et de confort pour les artistes, plus serait le bienvenu :-) !Les fonds serviront  :
* A la location du matériel audiovisuel, la fabrication et l'installation des oeuvres
(vidéo-projecteur, écrans, installations techniques, matériel informatique, matériel électro-acoustique,
éclairage et sonorisation)
* Au défraiement total et au confort des artistes et des techniciens
qui travaillent sur le projet 
En plus de son aspect créatif, Variations soutient la jeune création :
Offrir une plate-forme pour exposer des projets expérimentaux qui ne sont pas toujours
représentés dans les circuits traditionnels est une priorité pour notre
association d’artistes NEMNI !
L'exposition permettra de présenter les travaux de jeunes artistes talentueux, en phase de reconnaissance.MERCI A TOUS pour votre aide.
Collaborez et faites
circuler!!!!
Mais le plus
important : VENEZ voir le travail des artistes ce 18 juillet aux FRIGOS à PARIS
entre 17h00 et 23h00!Artistes participants : Shola Amoo, Guillaume Aventurin, Nadège Billery, Julien Blanchard, Manuel Bolanos, Sonia Bricout, Lena Brisson, Emilie Essel,  Xavier Gélard, Ola Jankowska, Morgan Lowenstein, Jenny Lu, Jonathan Martin, Camille Petit, Alice Petit, Ariel Pintor, David Rousselet, Hong Jimmy Seng, Vladilen Vierny, Antoine Villedieu, Joe Watson, Patrick ZorodduNEMNI

<h3>Detailed Description</h3>
<p><span><span class=""fsl"">Once inside the grounds of the Castle of Mischief, you might notice a strange 8' square box. Perhaps it is some kind of abandoned cargo? as you approach, you notice a small door, which you duck through. <br/> Once you enter ""Tripping Through the Looking Glass"", you dive inside an op-art painting surrounded by bright colors and interlocking geometric patterns. The ceiling has shapes cut out to let the glimmering silver reflections from the Castle and sunlight pour in. The silver shimmer will be incorporated into the walls of the structure giving it a sense of movement as your eyes traverse the shifting patterns inside and flowing into the surrounding area; a fully immersive experience. <br/> At night, the brightly-colored, interior lights will illuminate the space and the light will pour out of the top of the structure. This glow will paint the castle walls and floating dust around the work drawing participants to step inside.<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class=""fsl""><br/>The photographs that you can see are examples of what will cover the entirety of the interior of the room.  The panels from which the room will be constructed have already been made.  Each panel is 4' by 8' and all of them will be stored and transported flat and then assembled on-site. <br/></span></span></p>
<h3>About the Artist</h3>
<p>This is my first large-scale art project, but I have been very active in the DC/Baltimore burner community for about a year and a half.  I run a Baltimore specific-burner list, organize a monthly baltimore burner happy hour and a monthly dinner which rotates througout the DC/Baltimore/northern Virginia area.  I am also involved with Mischief DC, specifically assisting with budgeting and logistics for some of the regional burns we have attended and running a craft table. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Project Budget</h3>
<ul>
<li>actual cost: $154.33 at home depot for the structure itself, including wood, screws, nails, and plastic sheeing.</li>
<li>about $111 so far at Michaels for cardstock paper, spray adhesive, and clear varnish</li>
<li>estimated transport costs:
<ul>
<li>$746 to transport from DC to Burning Man (based on $7 per square foot cost on DC container)</li>
<li>$518 to rent a truck to go from Baltimore, MD to Asheville NC for Transformus (based on 10' truck from Budget, returning in Asheville)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>As you can see, transportation is the most expensive part of this endeavor.  I will continue to research transportation options. At the final burn of the season, the wood will be removed and burned, and the plastic sheets can hopefully be transported home relatively easily. </p>
<h3>Why I Need Funding</h3>
I have been dreaming about making this project a reality for some time.   But, because I'm also taking a sabbatical from work this year, I need some financial help to make this dream a reality!</div>
<div>
<h3>Want to Be More Involved?</h3>
I am also applying for art grants at some of our regional burn events to try and cover transport costs so that the piece can be seen in multiple places. I will need a team of people who can help transport and set up the piece.  Let me know if you are interested in getting more involved!</div></div>","Please check the Gallery for more pictures!  I will also be posting updates of my progress and as a way to thank everyone who is helping out with labor/in-kind contributions.

Temple University's Invisible Children chapter is excited to bring attention to our cause by hosting an exhibition showcasing the art of students that share our values of humanitarianism, activism and a passionate dedication to correcting social injustice in any way, shape or form. 
Arts Meets Activism will take place  October 5-13th at The Arts Garage in Philadelphia.
Our 9-day exhibition will not only include art work, but also live performances and themed events hosted by various organizations who believe in community involvement as a means of correcting social injustice. This event will be a revolutionary mix of people from across our diverse city, who have their own interpretation of what it means to be an activist. It will serve as an art gallery and place for live entertainment, as well as a place for the exchange of ideas and the beginning of ground-breaking collaboration.
Invisible Children's goal is to maintain their character as motivated misfits and masses redefining what it means to be an activist. For more information on the national organization please visit: www.invisiblechildren.com



The Impact:
Let's face it - fundraising and nonprofit work can seem very sanctimonious to some. But we are a small group of students who believe that direct community collaboration can make a HUGE impact on our lives and our world. 

We know this event will open new doors for everyone involved. Whether it be a priceless professional contact made or that perfect piece of artwork added to your almost-complete collection, no one will walk away from this event unchanged. There are so many elements to this event that we cannot possibly explore them all here in mere words. It is something you need to experience first-hand and we are providing you that rare opportunity. 



What We Need & What You Get:
Putting together an art gallery is a lot of work and costs a lot of money. What we are asking from you is to contribute to our operating budget. We need to pay for the 9-day gallery space--that is our biggest expense. But beyond that we need money for all of the other exciting things that will be going on during our exhibition. Trust us, this is going to be the most interactive art exhibition you have ever been to! We will need money for the supplies that goes into mounting and displaying art work as well as for any materials we will need for the different activities happening each night. 

We will be doing as much fundraising as possible in a bunch of different ways, but for those of you who don't know who we are, who are not living in Philadelphia or even in this country, this is how you get to know about us. Every dollar helps! 

We are a completely student-run organization. That means each member of our small but incredibly dedicated team is working their butts off in the classroom, at part time jobs and internships all while devoting amazing amounts of precious free time to this cause that we wholeheartedly believe in. 

Every person who makes a contribution will get a personal thank-you and invitation to collaborate with us on this event. 



Other Ways You Can Help
There are two incredibly helpful things you can do for us: 

1. TELL PEOPLE ABOUT IT! We need artists to submit their artwork and we need people to come look at it! We are working on creative ways to get all different kinds of people out to look at what we've put together, but there is always a group that gets left out. With your help, that won't happen - so please spread the word however you can! Tell your mom, your dad, your dog, your teacher, your barista, your hairdresser, your accountant, your plumber, your personal shopper, your personal shopper's mother-in-law, EVERYONE YOU KNOW. We honestly believe all people will benefit from the message we are trying to spread and we know the more people that know about it, the better. 

2. WORK WITH US! We are looking for anyone with any kind of message that revolves around social responsibility, activism, community involvement and development to come and share what they are doing! We want to have as many people involved as possible and it doesn't matter how - if you have an idea, tell us about it! Contact: TUICart@gmail.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>First off, thank you for even making it to this page and showing support for my journey with dance and the world! I truly believe that dance has allowed me the power to travel through this world to learn and mold what I think myself and all environments can become. So I need your help! Because what I have here is the opportunity to attend the final six-day audition process at the P.A.R.T.S. (Performing Arts Research and Training Studios) Training Program in Brussels, Belgium, which only happens every three years for dancers under the age of 23. By helping me make it to this, you will place my entire self in an environment I have been dreaming about for a very long time. A place where anything is possible for my art, and the art I make with others.</p>
<h3>WHAT I NEED FROM YOU!</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise around $1200-$1300 for travel arrangements and food! I need any support I can get in making my way to Brussels next month. The flights are nearly $800-$900 and then I will need money for food to be able to keep my body at its best capabilities for this audition. Anything helps, from a nickel to ten dollars, I appreciate everything and anything! You can see on the side what you can receive from me as a massive thank you!</p>
<h3>What this means for both of us</h3>
<p>By you helping me achieve my goal, you will be supporting someone who really believes in the honesty of dance and what it can do for the world at large. I have been working incredibly hard these past couple of years to find ways of truth through dance and composition and I think I need more time developing that in a saturated yet varied environment such as P.A.R.T.S.</p>
<p>I auditioned at the pre-selection in New York City and was one of four Americans selected to advance to the final selection. P.A.R.T.S, under the direction of Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker, is a superior school for contemporary dance, designed to train both dancers and choreographers, while also focusing on other performing arts and theoretical training. It is a three year program that trains everyday from Monday to Friday with a vast amount of teachers and choreographers from all over the world.</p>
<p>There will be 190 final applicants out of nearly 1,600 initial applicants at this final selection and 50 will be chosen, all coming from different parts of the world, from Latvia to Spain. To be among those 190 dancers will not only be incredibly humbling but also a true blessing. Attending the audition itself will be a huge success on its own, and the possibility of making it even further would extend my artistry and career in ways that you or I cannot imagine. The talent that comes out of this school is empowering to just hear. Choreographers and dancers that I truly look up to and admire have gone through this program, teach there, and work with the school as guests. To be part of a world that I have only heard about and can actually physicalize would benefit my entire process as a dancer.</p>
<h3>Other ways you can help besides the dinero!</h3>
<p>I understand that we are all facing hard times and some people can't donate, BUT if you know anyone that can, please share this with them! And also to familiarize people with my work send them to <a href=""http://www.marccrousillat.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.marccrousillat.com</a>. I really do think I have something to offer to this world through dance as my medium and attending this audition and possibly being part of the program will prove to be an incredible amount of experience for me to hone and expand my artistic capabilities.<br/><br/>All my best, <br/>Marc Crousillat</p></div>","Hello everyone!

secondly to support the costs of the display of the prints during the show and
after. I currently work 2 jobs with school full time so this campaign would
help ease the stress of making all my ends meet for school while letting me

13 Artspace, the Houston artist-run nonprofit, needs your help.  We have been a premier stop for artists
and art lovers for over five years. 
We love our building on Houston’s East Side, which hosts up to twenty
artists and show-cases dozens of alternative art shows every year, but it needs
a lot of love!  Can you help us
renovate the Box to make it a better place to work and show contemporary art?
What is Box 13?
BOX13 is an artist run
nonprofit innovative environment for the creation and advancement of
experimental contemporary art in Houston. BOX 13 resident artists create this
environment by offering affordable workspaces for emerging and established
artists, while dedicating substantial gallery space in our building for the
exhibition of artistic explorations by other artists throughout the year.
 
What do we want?  
We need to make Box 13 a more
functional and flexible space to create art and to enjoy and contemplate
art.  Our building is a former
sewing machine factory repurposed into studio and exhibit space.  We need $25,000 to improve the space.
Most walls in the building are masonry which makes installation very difficult
and we would love to have sheetrock instead.  Our AC can’t stand up to Houston weather and our windows are
not insulated so our temperature AND our energy bills are both high.  Our mop sink is permanently clogged
with plaster from an exhibition cleanup gone awry.  We’d also like to get a neon sign up help increase our
visibility from the street.  We
have virtually no signage, which makes it very hard for guests to find us when
we are showing amazing work from some of the best artists in Houston and
throughout the United States.  We’d
like to tackle these and other critical renovations to make Box 13 look and
feel better for our artists and our guests.  
·     
Sheetrock the walls
·     
Install track lighting
·     
AC and heating maintence and repairs
·     
Insulating our windows
·     
Fix the mop sink
·     
Neon sign to increase visability
For
this, we need money and that’s where you come in!
Box 13 wants your help!
Each
of the projects we want to undertake to fix the Box takes more money than we
have.  We have obtained reasonable
estimates for repairs and improvements for each project, but we can’t do it
alone.  Box 13 is a registered
nonprofit corporation and has no permanent staff.  We rely on resident artists to do everything from curating
art, making art, installing art, cleaning toilets, sweeping the galleries,
maintaining the website, raising funds and taking out the trash.   In order to keep our membership
fees reasonable for artists, we have made due, but the Box is overdue for a
make-over.  
How you can help?
The
building improvements are expensive but a donation in any amount will
help.  100% of money raised through
this campaign will be dedicated to increasing the functionality of Box 13’s
home and enhancing the gallery and studio experience for artists and patrons
alike.
What's in it for you?
Knowing that you are
contributing to Houston’s dynamic art scene may be enough for you.  Others may appreciate the awesome Box 13 Artspace swag, like stickers or
shirts.  Some of you pay prefer
owning art made by some of Houston’s most creative artists.  Pick your contribution level, and we
will make sure you know we appreciate you!

<h3>There's got to be a better way! </h3>
<p>That's what I thought when I was scrapbooking and stamping text with 26 individual stamps laying all over the table.  I decided to design and develop a new gadget that connects all the rubber stamps together on a belt, so they're always organized.  It's been a long journey of ups and downs over the last 5 years, but I'm finally ready to make my first production run.  I've got the molds built in China, and the factory is ready to roll just as soon as I get the funds raised.  I went to China last month to visit the factory and make sure we're all geared up to go.  So exciting!  It's almost like watching a child being born. Actually, watching a child being born is way more cool, but you get the idea.  This project has been incubating for a long time and it's ready to make it's presence known to the world.                                       Is that a newborn cry I hear?</p>
<h3>A little bit about me.</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm a mom of 8 (eight) kids and love every minute of my job as a homemaker.  Well, almost every minute :)  My kids range in age from 1-16 about every two years.  They have been involved in this invention process for the last 5 years, and have been my biggest supporters.  They're planning a trip to Disneyland someday when the project brings money in, instead of taking money out.  You know kids, they get their hopes up about things that are important to them, but my dreams are a little different.  When I was 13 I went to Haiti with my Grandfather and worked in a childrens hospital in Port-au-Prince.  I decided I would be a nurse and spend my life there.  I did become a nurse, but after getting married, my husband decided he didn't want to spend his life overseas, so I'm here in the USA, wishing I could help my friends in Haiti someway.  This project is a direct result of my brainstorming ways to create an income so I can impact the Haitian community where my Grandpa's mission is located, even though I can't be there in person.  Later next month, my husband and I are taking our 6 oldest children to Haiti so they can see what I've been working for all these years.  My first invention was the Craft-n-Doodle.  It's a more complicated set of tools and has taken even longer to develop.  My journey actually started 9 years ago.  You can read my story and see that project at <a href=""http://www.craft-n-doodle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.craft-n-doodle.com</a>   If I can get the money raised to make the first production run of Alphabuddys, I'll be able to generate enough from the sale of those units to run the next batch. Then we'll be up and running!  I've got alot of other inventions in the works, and I hope that the little bit I can do, will make a big difference in the lives of the people in Haiti.  I have learned so much from them about the value of relationships over material posessions. </li>
<li>Your contribution to this project will not only help to get this handy gadget in the hands of people who enjoy crafting, but you'll be making a much bigger impact in the lives of many people in Haiti.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Because I'm making the Alphabuddy in China, and it's a custom tool that they have to set up just for me, they require a minimum order of 10,000 units.  I also have to pay for freight to get them shipped here, so that all adds up to a grand total of $39,000.00.  I'm on my knees praying for a miracle that we can get this all raised in only 45 days.</li>
<li>The cool thing is that you can be the first in the world to ever own one of these handy gadgets.  If that doesn't give you bragging rights, I don't know what will. </li>
<li>I'm also including some rewards that involve our trip to Haiti.  I'm a professional photographer, so I'll be doing some journalistic photography while I'm in Haiti and designing a collection to send to supporters.  If you're interested in seing the faces of those lives that will be changed by your contribution, that reward is for you.</li>
<li>If I don't reach my entire goal, I'll have to go to a local investor and give away part of my company.  I hope I don't have to do that, but I'll do what it takes to keep this moving forward.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact YOU will make;</h3>
<p>This is a chance for you to get involved in something much bigger than just a handy stamping tool.  My Grandfather's mission, ""Water For Life"" (<a href=""http://www.wflhaiti.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wflhaiti.com</a>) has been drilling water wells in Haiti for over 25 years.  This year they are moving to a new community that is incredibly poverty stricken.  They walk miles to get water, and the health of the people there is adversely affected because the water they drink is from a river where animals bathe and women do laundry.  I want to help supply this community with clean water that can come from the water wells that the crew will dig as soon as the funds are available.  Tears come to my eyes just thinking about the look on those people's face when they see clean water pouring out of the pipe for the first time after a new well is drilled.  I've been there, I've seen it.  It's amazing.  (Talk about a celebration!) It's something I want to be a part of again, and again.  Providing one water well impacts a whole community for many, many years.</p>
<p>If you can't help with the project, or simple don't want a stamper that can make really cool letters and doodles, could you please tell someone else you know who might want one?  I'm going to be in Haiti for 10 days of this campaign, so I need all the help I can get to pass the word along when I'm out of the range of technology.  No facebook in the boonies unfortunately. </p>
<p>Thanks so much for considering this project and reading this far. I appreciate any help I can get.  From the bottom of my heart-I thank you.</p>
<p>Blessings to you and yours.</p>

<span>Hello, my name is Lamar Sharpe. I'm a spoken word artist/slam poet located in the Greensboro, NC area, and currently a member of the Piedmont Slam Poetry Slam Team based in Winston-Salem, NC and the captain for North Carolina A&amp;T's CUPSI collegiate poetry slam team. I am currently raising funds to attend the National Poetry Slam 2013, which is hosted by Poetry Slam, Inc. Throughout the year, I've been practicing and training to better myself not only as a poet, but as a writer in general. Through this, it has also allowed me to grow as a person, and as my poetry grows, I grow. My experience last year at the National Poetry Slam 2012 located in Charlotte, NC allowed me to take a new step as a writer. It opened avenues never seen, and has advanced my career as a poet to an all new high. Since then, I've had opportunities to perform in Greensboro, Durham, Raleigh, Charlotte, Salisbury, and Chapel Hill in various open mics, poetry slams, and several features within the city. This year's competition is located in Boston, MA, and I will be volunteering at the event. This will allow me to take a step further in not only poetry, but also opening networking opportunities for the CUPSI team at A&amp;T. I'm hoping to continue learning from poets nationwide about the creative art of performance poetry, competitive poetry, and the written art as a whole. I'm working hard to reach my goal through working, but I will need a little support. My goal is to reach between $600-$1000 by Sunday, August 11, 2013 to help with travel, lodging, dining, and transportation. All funds donated will immediately head to one of these four spots.

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>Greetings! Recently I moved to Los Angels and I have been exploring the art scene here. I have been painting and drawing ever since I held a pencil at the age of 5 and continued sporadically until I grew into adulthood. When I was 16, I obtained 1st class distinction in the state level board examination for art.</p>
<p>Over the years, I discovered my own uniqueness, style and approach, and worked on my refinement in that.</p>
<p>I draw inspiration not just from the visual reality around, but also the recollections of different experiences, travels, stories I heard, people, books those I read, movies I had watched. Different subjects inspire me and so are different media. I had worked on pencil, charcoal, oil pastels, soft and hard pastels, gauche and watercolors apart from my love for acrylics.</p>
<p><img alt=""My paintings at Los Angeles downtown independent theater"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i39.tinypic.com/2qk5xrc.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""My paintings at Los Angeles downtown independent theater""/></p>
<h3>This campaign</h3>
<p>I am looking for a solo-show in Los Angeles, and I am talking to different galleries and the amount of space they can give me. I need to go with a bear minimum of 10 paintings of size 24""x48"". And 10 more smaller ones to come up with different configurations with the layout available in gallery.<br/><br/>The entire affair may cost me more than I imagined. I want to mitigate the expenses with the funds I raise here.</p>
</div>
<div>Your contributions really help me to work quickly towards my works, finish more in number and submit to a gallery.</div>

Greetings! Recently I moved to Los Angels and I have been exploring the art scene here. I have been painting and drawing ever since I held a pencil at the age of 5 and continued sporadically until I grew into adulthood. When I was 16, I obtained 1st class distinction in the state level board examination for art.
Over the years, I discovered my own uniqueness, style and approach, and worked on my refinement in that.
I draw inspiration not just from the visual reality around, but also the recollections of different experiences, travels, stories I heard, people, books those I read, movies I had watched. Different subjects inspire me and so are different media. I had worked on pencil, charcoal, oil pastels, soft and hard pastels, gauche and watercolors apart from my love for acrylics.

This campaign
I am looking for a solo-show in Los Angeles, and I am talking to different galleries and the amount of space they can give me. I need to go with a bear minimum of 10 paintings of size 24""x48"". And 10 more smaller ones to come up with different configurations with the layout available in gallery.The entire affair may cost me more than I imagined. I want to mitigate the expenses with the funds I raise here.

Your contributions really help me to work quickly towards my works, finish more in number and submit to a gallery.

Wir haben den gescheiterten Einwanderern die Würde zurückgegeben, die unsere Abschottungspolitik ihnen raubte.

<h3><b>Der Marsch der Entschlossenen</b></h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Am Sonntag wollte ein Marsch der Entschlossenen weitere Tote zum Kanzleramt bringen, um sie direkt vor den politischen Entscheidungsträgern zu beerdigen. Auf dem Vorplatz des Kanzleramtes soll eine Gedenkstätte der besonderen Art entstehen: ein Friedhof für die „unbekannten Einwanderer“. Da die Europäische Union viel mehr Friedhöfe für ihre tödliche Politik benötigt, müssen auch in Deutschland neue Felder entstehen. Der Bagger, der vor Ort friedlich die Grundsteine für einen Gedenkfriedhof legen sollte, wurde vom Kanzleramt untersagt. Stattdessen hoben die Entschlossenen nach unserer Veranstaltung spontan hunderte Gräber auf der Wiese des Bundestages aus. Seither entstehen in <a href=""http://unknownrefugees.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ganz Europa neue Gräber</a>.</p>

<p>Keiner soll die Toten sehen: im August 2010 entdecken deutsche Aktivisten ein Massengrab in Sidiro, Griechenland mit über 200 Leichen. Frauen, Kinder und Männer, die beim Übertritt der (damals von deutschen Polizisten) schwer bewachten türkisch-griechischen Grenze ertrunken sind. Obwohl der Auftrag der Bezirksregierung eine Waschung und Beerdigung der Verstorbenen nach muslimischen Gebräuchen vorsah, verscharrt der Beerdigungsunternehmer die Leichname entlang eines schwer zugänglichen Sandweges im Hinterland – wo sie bis heute liegen. Der Wegesrand wird später von den Behörden kurzerhand zum Friedhofsfeld umdeklariert.</p>

</div></div>","Die Toten kommenEuropas Grenzen sind militärisch abgeriegelt. Sie sind jetzt die tödlichsten Grenzen der Welt. Jahr für Jahr sterben Tausende Menschen beim Versuch, sie zu überwinden. Europa hat den Einwanderern den Krieg erklärt – ein Krieg, dem ausschließlich Zivilisten zum Opfer fallen: am Evros, auf dem Mittelmeer und sogar in Nordafrika. Die Opfer dieses Krieges werden massenhaft im Hinterland südeuropäischer Staaten verscharrt. Sie tragen keine Namen. Ihre Angehörigen werden nicht ermittelt. Niemand schenkt ihnen Blumen.Gegen alle Regeln der Wahrscheinlichkeit haben wir eine Mutter, die bei ihrer Einwanderung nach Europa durch unser aller Untätigkeit ertrunken ist und von den Behörden als „unbekannt“ auf Sizilien verscharrt wurde, zu ihren Angehörigen nach Deutschland überführt. Ebenso haben wir einen sechzigjährigen Einwanderer, der auf der Höllentortur des Mittelmeers kollabiert ist – und dessen toter Körper von den Behörden zehn Wochen beschlagnahmt wurde, um von seinen Angehörigen ein Geständnis gegen den Fluchthelfer wegen „Schlepperei“ zu erpressen – aus den Fängen der Bürokratie herausgelöst. Wir haben den gescheiterten Einwanderern die Würde zurückgegeben, die unsere Abschottungspolitik ihnen raubte. Aber es geht nicht nur um die Rettung der Würde von Flüchtlingen.

„Gemeinsam mit den Angehörigen haben wir menschenunwürdige Grabstätten geöffnet und die Toten exhumiert. Sie sind jetzt
auf dem Weg nach Deutschland!“Philipp Ruch, Chefunterhändler
 

„Nach dem Willen des deutschen Innenministers sollten die
Toten unsichtbar bleiben. Wir bringen sie ins Zentrum der
Macht, dorthin, wo die Schießbefehle für den Europäischen Todesstreifen herkommen: in das Berliner Regierungsviertel.“
Stefan Pelzer, Eskalationsbeauftragter

""Das Recht der Angehörigen auf Totenfürsorge besitzt in Deutschland Verfassungsrang. Angehörige nicht zu ermitteln und ihnen damit die Möglichkeit zu nehmen, bei der Bestattung ihrer Liebsten anwesend zu sein, ist ein Verbrechen an der Menschheit.""
Cesy Leonard, Chefin des Planungsstabs



Der Marsch der Entschlossenen

Am Sonntag wollte ein Marsch der Entschlossenen weitere Tote zum Kanzleramt bringen, um sie direkt vor den politischen Entscheidungsträgern zu beerdigen. Auf dem Vorplatz des Kanzleramtes soll eine Gedenkstätte der besonderen Art entstehen: ein Friedhof für die „unbekannten Einwanderer“. Da die Europäische Union viel mehr Friedhöfe für ihre tödliche Politik benötigt, müssen auch in Deutschland neue Felder entstehen. Der Bagger, der vor Ort friedlich die Grundsteine für einen Gedenkfriedhof legen sollte, wurde vom Kanzleramt untersagt. Stattdessen hoben die Entschlossenen nach unserer Veranstaltung spontan hunderte Gräber auf der Wiese des Bundestages aus. Seither entstehen in ganz Europa neue Gräber.







Der neugestaltete Vorhof am Kanzleramt: das Friedhofsfeld Den unbekannten Einwanderern für die Opfer der militärischen Abriegelung Europas.

So geht Europa mit seinen Toten um!



Keiner soll die Toten sehen: im August 2010 entdecken deutsche Aktivisten ein Massengrab in Sidiro, Griechenland mit über 200 Leichen. Frauen, Kinder und Männer, die beim Übertritt der (damals von deutschen Polizisten) schwer bewachten türkisch-griechischen Grenze ertrunken sind. Obwohl der Auftrag der Bezirksregierung eine Waschung und Beerdigung der Verstorbenen nach muslimischen Gebräuchen vorsah, verscharrt der Beerdigungsunternehmer die Leichname entlang eines schwer zugänglichen Sandweges im Hinterland – wo sie bis heute liegen. Der Wegesrand wird später von den Behörden kurzerhand zum Friedhofsfeld umdeklariert.


Am 22. Januar 2015 werden in Catania auf Sizilien 13 Leichen von Flüchtlingen in einer Lagerhalle entdeckt, darunter zwei Kinder. Die Toten lagen dort aufgrund von „bürokratischen Hürden“ einfach 8 Monate rum. Man hatte sie einfach vergessen.

Am 30. Mai 2015 verkünden die Medien die Bergung von 17 Toten (z.B. hier, hier und hier). Was sie nicht ahnen: dieses Mal haben wir alles vorbereitet, um für die europäische Öffentlichkeit zu verfolgen, was mit diesen Toten geschieht. Die Leichnamen werden in Müllsäcke verpackt und in eine Kühlkammer im Krankenhaus von Augusta übereinander geworfen – gegen jede Form des Anstands. Es sind Bilder, die wir nie sehen sollten. Wer es wirklich sehen und die Hintergründe erfahren will, klickt bitte hier.
Bitte lesen Sie auch unsere allgemeinen FAQs zum Thema!




„Der Aktion gingen die intensivsten Recherchen seit Bestehen
des Zentrums für Politische Schönheit voraus. In den vergangenen Monaten haben wir
fünf EU-Außengrenzen besucht, die Angehörigen von Flüchtlingen ermittelt, die Massengräber besichtigt und Kühlhäuser inspiziert. Die Zustände vor Ort sind
eine Schande für Europa. Die Toten werden weggeworfen wie Müll. Und das in unser aller Namen.“
Paul Stauffenberg, Leiter der Außeneinsätze auf Sizilien

director.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I moved to NYC in
2010 to work for New York City Opera on their directing staff. Their
dissolution last fall raised questions for me about opera production and
audience in NYC, and I am making work to address these questions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I have been
programmed by Whitebox Art Center on the LES Manhattan September 6 – 21 to
premiere a work in their upper gallery. For two weeks I am installing the
rehearsal and performance of an operatic score, open to the public daily except Thursdays, culminating in
two fully produced performances, in Italian, with live orchestra and projected English titles. I have chosen one of my
favorite operas, Handel’s <i>Alcina</i>, as the source
material, and assembled a team of opera professionals I admire to join in uniquely providing access to our process.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I am grateful that
Whitebox is championing this premiere as part of their fall program
WhiteboxLab: SoundLounge, a platform for artists working in temporal mediums
like sound and performance art.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is important to
me that this installation be free and open to the public to provide maximum
accessibility to the material and the performers, which is why we are launching
this campaign. The music director, Geoffrey McDonald, and I are responsible
for the following budget:</p>
<p>$8,000  Orchestra
costs</p>
<p>$3,000  Orchestra
rentals</p>
<p>$15,000 Singer costs</p>
<p>$12,000 Designer costs</p>
<p>$4,000  Installation
costs</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The majority of
the budget goes toward the fees of the accomplished artists we are honored to be working with. We appeal to crowd sourcing to give this project social heft and reach
our funding goal. This independently produced project can only succeed through
the efforts of the audience - to attend, to donate, and to promote on social
media. We humbly ask that you advocate for this installation by sharing it with
your social network of friends, by email, by Twitter, by Facebook, and by word
of mouth.  Indigogo asks to remind
you to use their share tools!</p>

by George Frideric Handel, with libretto by Riccardo Broschi, based on Ludovico
Ariosto’s famous best-seller <i>Orlando Furioso</i>. It is a story of
love and illusion that premiered during Handel’s remarkable hit London season
in 1735, and is regarded as among his most inventive and melodic musical
scores.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The sorceress
Alcina lives on an island in the ocean, and enchants the knights that arrive on
her shores. When tired of her lovers she transforms them into rocks, trees and
wild beasts.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The heroic knight
Ruggiero has fallen under her spell, and forgotten his fiancée, Bradamante.
Bradamante, in male disguise as “Ricciardo,” has set out with her guardian,
Melisso, to recover Ruggiero, and the two are shipwrecked on Alcina’s island by
fate. There they encounter Alcina’s flighty sorceress sister, Morgana, who
instantly falls in love with “Ricciardo.” They discover Ruggiero in Alcina’s
embrace, with no memory of his betrothal. He angrily rebukes “Ricciardo” as
competing for Alcina’s affections. 
Alcina’s general, Oronte, in love with Morgana and stung by her sudden
infatuation with “Ricciardo”, arrives to challenge “him” to a duel. This
dramatic scenario of identities and transformations plays out until the source
of Alcina’s magic power is broken, and all, including Alcina’s transfigured
lovers, are returned to human shape and sanity.</p>

Portrait by Matthu Placek.</div>","I am an opera
director.
I moved to NYC in
2010 to work for New York City Opera on their directing staff. Their
dissolution last fall raised questions for me about opera production and
audience in NYC, and I am making work to address these questions.
I have been
programmed by Whitebox Art Center on the LES Manhattan September 6 – 21 to
premiere a work in their upper gallery. For two weeks I am installing the
rehearsal and performance of an operatic score, open to the public daily except Thursdays, culminating in
two fully produced performances, in Italian, with live orchestra and projected English titles. I have chosen one of my
favorite operas, Handel’s Alcina, as the source
material, and assembled a team of opera professionals I admire to join in uniquely providing access to our process.
I am grateful that
Whitebox is championing this premiere as part of their fall program
WhiteboxLab: SoundLounge, a platform for artists working in temporal mediums
like sound and performance art.
It is important to
me that this installation be free and open to the public to provide maximum
accessibility to the material and the performers, which is why we are launching
this campaign. The music director, Geoffrey McDonald, and I are responsible
for the following budget:
$8,000  Orchestra
costs
$3,000  Orchestra
rentals
$15,000 Singer costs
$12,000 Designer costs
$4,000  Installation
costs
The majority of
the budget goes toward the fees of the accomplished artists we are honored to be working with. We appeal to crowd sourcing to give this project social heft and reach
our funding goal. This independently produced project can only succeed through
the efforts of the audience - to attend, to donate, and to promote on social
media. We humbly ask that you advocate for this installation by sharing it with
your social network of friends, by email, by Twitter, by Facebook, and by word
of mouth.  Indigogo asks to remind
you to use their share tools!
I hope you will
consider sponsoring us, as we greatly need the help.

by George Frideric Handel, with libretto by Riccardo Broschi, based on Ludovico
Ariosto’s famous best-seller Orlando Furioso. It is a story of
love and illusion that premiered during Handel’s remarkable hit London season
in 1735, and is regarded as among his most inventive and melodic musical
scores.
The sorceress
Alcina lives on an island in the ocean, and enchants the knights that arrive on
her shores. When tired of her lovers she transforms them into rocks, trees and
wild beasts.
The heroic knight
Ruggiero has fallen under her spell, and forgotten his fiancée, Bradamante.
Bradamante, in male disguise as “Ricciardo,” has set out with her guardian,
Melisso, to recover Ruggiero, and the two are shipwrecked on Alcina’s island by
fate. There they encounter Alcina’s flighty sorceress sister, Morgana, who
instantly falls in love with “Ricciardo.” They discover Ruggiero in Alcina’s
embrace, with no memory of his betrothal. He angrily rebukes “Ricciardo” as
competing for Alcina’s affections. 
Alcina’s general, Oronte, in love with Morgana and stung by her sudden
infatuation with “Ricciardo”, arrives to challenge “him” to a duel. This
dramatic scenario of identities and transformations plays out until the source
of Alcina’s magic power is broken, and all, including Alcina’s transfigured
lovers, are returned to human shape and sanity.
Reservations for
admission to the General rehearsal on September 19 and Performances September 20 – 21 will be available through the Whitebox Art Center event page in early

<h3>Downward Spiral</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Francesco Bracci and I'm a visual artist and an architect from Costa Rica.  For the past 11 years I've been developing art projects on public spaces and this has become my passion. I really enjoy connecting people through art. You can see more of my work at: <a href=""http://www.fbracci.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fbracci.com</a></p>
<p>One of my main interests is the use of the material. I realized that eventually is not necessary to use virgin materials if we have so many elements out there that already fulfill its useful life and  that can be used again and again, with a different function. The good thing is that we have them all around us, you just have to dig into it.</p>
<p>Here are some samples of my previous works:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492692214/kgn6pzlj1zufsq6vsloo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Doing art on public spaces is usually a complex mission, because there are many costs and logistics involved. That's why all my work have been basically done here in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>This year I received an invitation to participate in Open Art ( <a href=""http://openart.se/2017/en/start-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://openart.se/2017/en/start-2/</a> ) wich is held in Orebrö Sweden. This is a great opportunity because the main focus of this Biennial is the Public Space, which is my main field of interest.</p>
<h2><strong>THE PROJECT:</strong></h2>
<p>The place where I'm going to develop my work, is the iconic and beautiful Orebrö Castle, which is surrounded by water and sidewalks .</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492699224/haljqdr9hdn2501u34wl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>My project consist in building a prototype composed of 3000  beer crates </strong>that emerges from the water as an element that connects visually and functionally different levels and perspectives. So you can be walking on the sidewalk and immediately be transport into the water. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>I choose to work with plastic crates, because it's a material you can find almost in every place. They have a great structural qualities and they work as a big Lego on a public space.The final colors will be red and blue, which are the original colors of the crates we're going to use.The dimensions of the project are the following: 24 mts long x 4 mts height x 4mts width.</p>
<h2><strong>THE COSTS:</strong></h2>
<p>The plan is to travel from Costa Rica to Sweden at the end of may, because the inauguration of the Biennial is on june 18th, 2017. I need approx. 3 weeks to assemble the entire structure.</p>
<p>The construction can be summarize in the following items:</p>
<p>1) Building team: I need to put together a team of 8 people during 2 weeks to connect all 3000 crates together: $4000</p>
<p>2) Metal structure: To make this element stable ( that needs to resist people walking inside), I need to build a metal structure that comes from the water to the upper level. So in this case, I need to buy the materials and hire a metal building company to do it, : $6000</p>
<p>3) Logistics, Transportation, Crane: $3000</p>
<p>4) Campaign Fee's (IndieGoGo + Paypal and credit card fees): $1500</p>
<p>Open Art is helping me with airplane tickets, logistics on site, engineers to calculate the metal structure, general contacts and accommodation.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned, I'm a senior photography major and book arts concentrator at MICA finishing up my senior photography thesis. I have been making handmade books for the entirety of my time in college and it's a process I've fallen in love with. It feels like a dream to have complete creative freedom over my own photobook, <i>Eventually I Will Learn to Stop Saying Sorry</i>, as part of my thesis. This is the largest scale project I have ever undertaken and it has been met with wonderful reception from my peers and professors. I have worked countless hours towards the completion of this book already and have taken a great deal of valuable critique and feedback into account. I have exhibited my books in several MICA galleries as well as Davis Orton Gallery and the Griffin Museum of Photography, to name a few.

<p><strong>What I Need</strong></p>
<p>Because this is the capstone project for my Bachelor's degree, I have chosen the highest quality materials to construct my book. My primary costs are paper, ink, and cover materials. The book will be printed on Hahnemuhle paper on the high-quality Epson printers I am fortunate enough to have access to through school. It will be finished with a velvet cover and letterpressed spine. The edition size is 15 copies; however, if I exceed my goal, I would like to expand that to 20 copies.</p>
<p>I am expecting to spend the majority of my funding (around $450) on the paper. I have used Hahnemuhle paper almost exclusively since winning their Student Photo Card Contest in 2015 and the quality is second to none. Paper choice is essential for a good photobook, and I believe I have chosen the best.</p>
<p>The rest of my funding will go towards the cost of ink and cover materials. I have chosen to make a relatively small book (4.5""x6.5"") to mimic a diary and am not anticipating high ink costs. In order to construct the book's hard cover, I will need several yards of red velvet bookcloth as well as high-quality bookboard.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will not only help me complete this book, but will also help me get my story out there. One of the main goals of my artistic practice is to create an open dialogue about abuse and trauma and how it affects survivors. I am very transparent in my practice and hope I can inspire others to tell their stories as well.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The primary challenge with creating an edition of fifteen artist books is consistency. I have budgeted for several ""mess-up"" copies of the book because I strive to make each book as perfect as humanly possible.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
As mentioned, I'm a senior photography major and book arts concentrator at MICA finishing up my senior photography thesis. I have been making handmade books for the entirety of my time in college and it's a process I've fallen in love with. It feels like a dream to have complete creative freedom over my own photobook, Eventually I Will Learn to Stop Saying Sorry, as part of my thesis. This is the largest scale project I have ever undertaken and it has been met with wonderful reception from my peers and professors. I have worked countless hours towards the completion of this book already and have taken a great deal of valuable critique and feedback into account. I have exhibited my books in several MICA galleries as well as Davis Orton Gallery and the Griffin Museum of Photography, to name a few. My first self-published book, What Are You Looking At?, was accepted into Davis Orton's 8th Annual Self-Published Photobook show this past winter.

<p>The historic mill is home to countless artisans, photographers, eateries, etc. This particular building is the perfect venue for a collaborative studio, boasting expansive resources for Artists right on site.

We will be able to offer space to fit within any budget; from $100 per month for a table and shelf space, up to $200 per month for dedicated space. Both include amenities such as WiFi, a kitchen, and even bathrooms with showers. There will also be a shared desktop Mac as well as a printer for artists to use and extremely low cost screen printing services just down the hall.</p>
<p>This concept is a fairly straight forward business model. Overhead expenses are kept at a minimum, allowing the space to flourish, affording local artists beautiful, low cost workspace, in an fresh, hip environment, offering all of the comforts anyone would need.</p>
<p><b>How We Will Utilize Funds...</b></p><p>Funding will go toward outfitting the space to accommodate new Artists and to cover the lease and utilities of the space during the transition into a shared work space.

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>I am full-swing into preparing for this weekend's markets!  Will do the best I can with what I have - though things are really really tight so if you're able to contribute that would be a great big help!  I still have staffing, framing, printing and display items to pay for...</b></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>Please also check the UPDATES page - for an update with info about Perks as well as some other neat stuff happening.  Thanks to all who have contributed and shared the campaign so far, and those who have really kicked into gear promoting my campaign in its final hours.  Much gratitude and love to you all! </b></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>**********</b></div>
<p>That's me - Tracy Jager aka livingferal.  I'm an artist in
Vancouver, Canada, <b>and I make
quirky, poetic and surreal collages.</b>  That's one of them, 'think big,'
from my 'aspire' series.  I sell them and other things like printed
scarves, pillows and phone cases through my <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/livingferal"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/livingferal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Etsy shop</a>.  I'm currently making the
transition to full-time artist.</p>
<p><b>I've been accepted into two big art markets</b> - <a href=""http://ecuaa.ca/whats-on/art-market-2014/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://ecuaa.ca/whats-on/art-market-2014/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Alumni Art Market @ Emily Carr</a>, and <a href=""http://etsyvancouver.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://etsyvancouver.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">EtsyMade in Canada market</a> - at the end of September.  That's
basically three and a half days of markets!  These are going to be
high-profile events in locations with lots of traffic, and they're a great
opportunity.  <b>I’ve also been contacted by a retail boutique that wants to carry my
art</b> – and I have plans to be in touch with others.  <b>The
challenge is that I sell my work online and make it on-demand so I don't have a
big inventory</b>.  </p>
<p>For several years after graduating from art
school I was quite ill, and so was unable to take the usual routes
artists might take to establish their careers - I couldn't do large projects
or pursue exhibition opportunities.  So I made small pieces like my
collages, which I listed on Etsy. I’ve now regained my health, and for the past several months have been
working hard to catch up<b>,</b> producing lots of new work and
expanding my product range.  However, because I was sick for so long I
don't have other forms of credit available to me.  <b>I'm asking for your
help so I can produce inventory, and in return I'm offering lots of awesome
perks</b> - including prints and other things I'll be creating
specifically for this campaign!  </p>

an art book fair this fall I hope to take part in.</p>
<p><b>This is all part of a larger plan</b>.  Doing these markets, generating further
exposure to my art, and getting it into retail shops will help me generate income...these
are stepping stones, and will give me room to seek illustration contracts and
commissions.  <b>A steadier stream of

important to me that my art have meaning – not always overt or in-your-face,
but often multi-layered, sensed as being there under the surface.  </p>
<p>I call my collages 'dreamscapes' because many touch on the idea of
dreams - those you might have when sleeping, and those when you're awake.
 <b>It is one of my goals to create a sense of wonder and inspire others with
the images I create. </b></p>
<p>I paid my way through art school as a freelance writer and
communications consultant, but my
dream has long been to become a full-time working artist.  When I
received my BFA in Visual Art in 2005 from the Emily Carr University of Art
&amp; Design I had big plans.</p><b>
</b><p>These were put on hold a few months after I graduated when fire
destroyed my home, including my office and studio.  A few months after
that I started to become ill, which progressed to the point I was pretty much
disabled, unable to do simple tasks like walk my dog, do the dishes, or cook a
meal, let alone work or make art.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In 2008 I rallied enough to begin making art again - though because
I was still very sick, sometimes down for weeks or months at a
time, I was unable to do large projects or pursue exhibition opportunities.
 So I made small pieces and put them on Etsy.  <b>I've been blessed
to connect and share my art with people around the world, and have received
many kind messages from people about how my art has touched them.</b></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In 2012, thanks to the wonders of the internet, I was able to learn more
about my health conditions and what I might be able to do, and began the path
to healing.  It's been a long journey, but finally, since early 2014, I am
well enough that I can be productive every day.  <b>And for the last nine
months I've been working hard </b>to create many new collages and expand
my products to include pillows, silk scarves, phone cases and more, so people
can choose different ways to include my art in their lives.  Because I was
ill for such a long time I don't have other types of loans or credit available
to me, but <b>I have a plan and I need some help right now to keep things moving.</b></span></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>As a friend of mine recently said so beautifully, “Art is a
treasure and artists are treasure guides.” 
I like to believe that my art is both a treasure and a guide, to me and
to others...it has certainly helped me navigate through difficult
circumstances.  To continue making art
even in the face of ongoing adversity requires a special love of creating, and
a trust that others will also find the art meaningful. <b>I have held onto
the faith about my art and belief that I can see my plan through, and I'm
asking for you to take that leap with me.</b></p>
<p>With the markets and this campaign, I'll be taking every opportunity I
can to get word out about my art in the next month and beyond.  I'll be
sharing regular updates of newly created pieces and products...I'll be making
some new scarf designs, stickers, a little book, and more.  And if you
follow my campaign I will also amuse you with occasional pics of me (and maybe
even a video!...we'll see).</p>
<p>If my work speaks to you, and you aren't able to contribute financially,
you can still <b>help by following what I'm doing, sharing the campaign and
getting the word out about my art! </b></p>

<h3>A couple of notes</h3>
<p>- I've chosen a flexible funding campaign because I have limited
time to raise funds, since the markets take place the last weekend of
September, and I'm committed to doing them no matter what.</p>
<p>If I pass the target - well that means I've
had tons of supporters and I get to create more fabulous things to send out! I'll use any extra money to pursue other opportunities

<p>- My campaign is set to receive funds via PayPal.</p>
<p>- In case you're not aware, you can use PayPal to securely use your
credit card, even if you don't have a PayPal account.</p>
<p>- If you make a contribution, you'll notice that the email is in my
name, but the name on PayPal is someone else - that's Mike, who I live with.
 It's the main account I've used for years and it is 'verified,' as it
needs to be for an Indiegogo campaign. So no worries, I have access to the
account and the funds! I could have another PayPal account verified but that
can take a bit of time, so going with this one now...</p>

</div></div>","FRIDAY SEPT 26 - LAST DAY OF CAMPAIGN!
I am full-swing into preparing for this weekend's markets!  Will do the best I can with what I have - though things are really really tight so if you're able to contribute that would be a great big help!  I still have staffing, framing, printing and display items to pay for...
Please also check the UPDATES page - for an update with info about Perks as well as some other neat stuff happening.  Thanks to all who have contributed and shared the campaign so far, and those who have really kicked into gear promoting my campaign in its final hours.  Much gratitude and love to you all! 
**********
That's me - Tracy Jager aka livingferal.  I'm an artist in
Vancouver, Canada, and I make
quirky, poetic and surreal collages.  That's one of them, 'think big,'
from my 'aspire' series.  I sell them and other things like printed
scarves, pillows and phone cases through my Etsy shop.  I'm currently making the
transition to full-time artist.
I've been accepted into two big art markets - The Alumni Art Market @ Emily Carr, and EtsyMade in Canada market - at the end of September.  That's
basically three and a half days of markets!  These are going to be
high-profile events in locations with lots of traffic, and they're a great
opportunity.  I’ve also been contacted by a retail boutique that wants to carry my
art – and I have plans to be in touch with others.  The
challenge is that I sell my work online and make it on-demand so I don't have a
big inventory.  
For several years after graduating from art
school I was quite ill, and so was unable to take the usual routes
artists might take to establish their careers - I couldn't do large projects
or pursue exhibition opportunities.  So I made small pieces like my
collages, which I listed on Etsy. I’ve now regained my health, and for the past several months have been
working hard to catch up, producing lots of new work and
expanding my product range.  However, because I was sick for so long I
don't have other forms of credit available to me.  I'm asking for your
help so I can produce inventory, and in return I'm offering lots of awesome
perks - including prints and other things I'll be creating
specifically for this campaign!  


 


'a new perspective (on the world)' - digitally printed silk scarf
The plan (what I need, what you get & the bigger picture)It's simple, really:  you make a contribution = you get some art!Now, the details.  My campaign goal is $4500.  The art market organizers expect
thousands of people to come to the events, and I want to have lots of items
available to wow them with! 
The money raised will be used to:

buy fine art papers and archival inks for my giclee prints, and frames
for original collages
hire a local printer to make copies of my first limited edition artist's
book, plus at least one other book I'll make this month - plus notecards,
postcards, stickers and business cards.  
order digitally-printed silk scarves, velveteen pillow covers and
pencil cases, made by a Montreal-based manufacturer I'm working with; they have
Canada's only large-scale digital printer of natural fabrics
pay two to three people to help me staff my tables, since there is
overlap between the market days
As a market vendor, I have to give small items to the first 100 visitors, so I will use some of the things I
produce for those.  
I'll also use the pieces to get my work into retail stores. And there's
an art book fair this fall I hope to take part in.
This is all part of a larger plan.  Doing these markets, generating further
exposure to my art, and getting it into retail shops will help me generate income...these
are stepping stones, and will give me room to seek illustration contracts and
commissions.  A steadier stream of
income will allow me to pursue two very exciting projects that are currently
sitting in wait:

a collaborative project with the working title
‘the projection room.’ My collaboration partner is a gifted seer and intuitive,
and items created will include tools that will allow the user to reflect on
their own stories and tap into their subconscious. 
a larger project (which I currently envision a
book, but could be more) with the working title ‘limbo’; using image and text, it will explore the
concept of liminality (the in-between space) and ways to navigate through change
and transition.
By supporting me in getting my art to market right now, you’ll be helping
to lay the foundation for something bigger and giving me the space needed to do
these projects.  
Of course, some of the funding will create the awesome perks I'm
offering in exchange for your help! I'll be making a
special edition print specifically for the campaign.  Other perks
include stickers, cards, pillows, scarves, t-shirts, and books.
 There are also options for a custom-made collage.  See the Updates and Gallery section for photos - I'll be posting through the campaign!


 
About me (past, present, future)






''somewhere along the way she found herself' - digitally printed velveteen pillow
I’m a dreamer and storyteller.  It’s
important to me that my art have meaning – not always overt or in-your-face,
but often multi-layered, sensed as being there under the surface.  
I call my collages 'dreamscapes' because many touch on the idea of
dreams - those you might have when sleeping, and those when you're awake.
 It is one of my goals to create a sense of wonder and inspire others with
the images I create. 
I paid my way through art school as a freelance writer and
communications consultant, but my
dream has long been to become a full-time working artist.  When I
received my BFA in Visual Art in 2005 from the Emily Carr University of Art
& Design I had big plans.
These were put on hold a few months after I graduated when fire
destroyed my home, including my office and studio.  A few months after
that I started to become ill, which progressed to the point I was pretty much
disabled, unable to do simple tasks like walk my dog, do the dishes, or cook a
meal, let alone work or make art.

In 2008 I rallied enough to begin making art again - though because
I was still very sick, sometimes down for weeks or months at a
time, I was unable to do large projects or pursue exhibition opportunities.
 So I made small pieces and put them on Etsy.  I've been blessed
to connect and share my art with people around the world, and have received
many kind messages from people about how my art has touched them.

In 2012, thanks to the wonders of the internet, I was able to learn more
about my health conditions and what I might be able to do, and began the path
to healing.  It's been a long journey, but finally, since early 2014, I am
well enough that I can be productive every day.  And for the last nine
months I've been working hard to create many new collages and expand
my products to include pillows, silk scarves, phone cases and more, so people
can choose different ways to include my art in their lives.  Because I was
ill for such a long time I don't have other types of loans or credit available
to me, but I have a plan and I need some help right now to keep things moving.



Make a leap of faith - support the dream!

</h3> <p>My name is Tracey and I make polymer clay art.  I've been working with polymer clay since a beginning drawing teacher in art school suggested that all the students pick up a mode of creativity apart from drawing, (like knitting or needlepoint) so we didn't get burnt out drawing hundreds of facial features and spheres.  I was a very obedient student so I bought a few packages of polymer clay and I really got into it.  I really love the things I can do with this material.  A big image can be reduced to the size of just a few millimeters without losing any of the details or clarity and I can make a design repeat over and over to make beautiful patterns and I can also sculpt with it so I can make three-dimensional pieces that I cover with slices of polymer clay murrine canes.  Here's a video I made a few years ago of one of my favorite canes. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALNRD1eyY8s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALNRD1eyY8s</a><br/><br/>I make boxes, bowls, clock faces, refrigerator magnets, key chains, as well as wearable pieces like rings, brooches, earrings, bracelets, pendants, buttons, barrettes, hairpins, chokers, and cufflinks.  <br/>My facebook page is here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Polyflavour"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/Polyflavour</a> <br/>It's the best place to see most of my work

<h3><span>I'm San Francisco artist, <a href=""http://www.lauralineback.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Laura Lineback</a>, and I have been given the opportunity to make an iconic piece of San Francisco art - but I need your help in funding it to fruition!</span></h3>This campaign goes beyond a cool art idea, as it touches me personally. My father, and best friend, passed away, before my very eyes, from a heart attack on December 31st, 2012, at the young age of 60. Losing the most important person in my life has heightened my awareness to preventable heart disease and the wide-reaching demographic that it affects every day. <span style="""">One in three deaths from cardiovascular disease is preventable and more than half of preventable heart disease and stroke deaths happen to people under the age of 65. <br/><br/></span>
</div><div><span style="""">I believe this Heart is an opportunity to bring awareness to preventative heart disease, giving both the affected, and their loved ones, an opportunity to overcome the disease and live long, fulfilling lives.

<h3><span>More about #heartsinsf:</span></h3>Whether a resident of the Bay Area or a tourist fond of the City By The Bay, you've probably heard of or seen the giant heart sculptures located throughout the city. They are literal landmarks that people from all over the world come to visit!

<p><span>These sculptures are <a href=""http://sfghf.org/events/hearts-in-sf/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hearts in San Francisco</a>, an annual public art installation, started in 2004 by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_General_Hospital"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">San Francisco General Hospital Foundation</a> for the purpose of fundraising. Every year the hearts are painted by local artists and auctioned off, with the proceeds going to the foundation to provide research, education, patient services, facilities, and equipment purchases.</span></p>
<br/>I am one of NINE (yup, only NINE!!) San Francisco artists awarded the chance to make my design a reality, I just need the funding to continue!<p></p>

<h3><span><br/></span></h3>
<h3><span>The Idea:</span></h3>
<p>My proposal that was approved is to turn the Heart into a giant, reflective, chrome mirror. The hearts are already popular attractions in SF, with many taking their photos in front of them. Why not take your photo IN one of them? #letmetakeaselfie</p>Today people are constantly taking pictures on their phones and posting said pics to Instagram and Facebook. I think SFGH's Hearts in San Francisco has a wonderful opportunity to participate in this online discussion. Naming the heart with a hashtag would bring more internet activity surrounding the hearts, which would hopefully raise more money and awareness. The title? ""#heartsinsf""<p><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b></b></h3>
<h3><span>This has never been done before!!</span></h3>So far, all of the Hearts in San Francisco have been beautifully painted or sculptured by talented artists, but NONE have been so reflective that you could actually take your picture in it.<p></p>
<p></p>

My father, and best friend, passed away, before my very eyes, from a heart attack on December 31st, 2012, at the young age of 60. Losing the most important person in my life has heightened my awareness to preventable heart disease and the wide-reaching demographic that it affects every day. One in three deaths from cardiovascular disease is preventable and more than half of preventable heart disease and stroke deaths happen to people under the age of 65. 
I believe this Heart is an opportunity to bring awareness to preventative heart disease, giving both the affected, and their loved ones, an opportunity to overcome the disease and live long, fulfilling lives. Raising the funds to make this happen would mean more than the world to me.





More about #heartsinsf:Whether a resident of the Bay Area or a tourist fond of the City By The Bay, you've probably heard of or seen the giant heart sculptures located throughout the city. They are literal landmarks that people from all over the world come to visit!


These sculptures are Hearts in San Francisco, an annual public art installation, started in 2004 by the San Francisco General Hospital Foundation for the purpose of fundraising. Every year the hearts are painted by local artists and auctioned off, with the proceeds going to the foundation to provide research, education, patient services, facilities, and equipment purchases.
I am one of NINE (yup, only NINE!!) San Francisco artists awarded the chance to make my design a reality, I just need the funding to continue!





The Idea:
My proposal that was approved is to turn the Heart into a giant, reflective, chrome mirror. The hearts are already popular attractions in SF, with many taking their photos in front of them. Why not take your photo IN one of them? #letmetakeaselfieToday people are constantly taking pictures on their phones and posting said pics to Instagram and Facebook. I think SFGH's Hearts in San Francisco has a wonderful opportunity to participate in this online discussion. Naming the heart with a hashtag would bring more internet activity surrounding the hearts, which would hopefully raise more money and awareness. The title? ""#heartsinsf""


This has never been done before!!So far, all of the Hearts in San Francisco have been beautifully painted or sculptured by talented artists, but NONE have been so reflective that you could actually take your picture in it.


Once made, this piece will be a way for people to interact with the hearts like never before. This mirrored heart is a reflective microcosm of the individual and the city, the symbiotic relationship between the two; the pain, the growth, the triumphs.

<h3>
<br/>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Five ambitious and artistic people are going on a journey this summer to experience incredible things in life while producing aritistic forms in each city we stop. Travelling almost 10,000 Km (Seattle-Los Angeles-Las Vegas-Texas-Georgia-New York), we will be on the road for two weeks, collaboratively exchanging creative ideas.</p>
<p>Each members will produce different types of art that they specialize; creating music, videoes, and photos that represent the specific space and atmosphere of the city we're in. 15 days on the road means 15 different places that we'll be visiting! Each video and music will be posted on our website at the end of this year.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are Amanda Thomas, Jordy Pastor, and Ari Rose: three hardworking young people on different paths in life, united on this project by our love of creation, interactivity, and the culture of Burning Man.  We are dedicated to using repurposed materials in the construction of this piece whenever possible.   In this age of commodification, consumption and disposability, turning discarded materials into art is a constructive rebellion against consumerism and its wastefulness.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Amanda is a young mother of one, and primarily a visual artist whose work has recently begun expanding to include larger scale sculptures and installations.  Her work is usually very intimate, and she believes the best way to express the universal is through the personal.  AudioOracle is her latest brainchild.</p>
<p>Jordy fell in love with art at an early age when he began experimenting in three-dimensional forms. After working with several different mediums, the attraction to clean lines lead him to pursue carpentry and welding where his attention to detail and constructive knowledge has greatly expanded.  He hopes his work will continue to evolve as he works with new mediums and new people.</p>
<p>Ari has a history of doing way too many things at once, such as visual 
2D/3D art, music of various styles and instruments and philosophical and
 scientific pursuits in the hopes that she can somehow advance the human
 species and its understanding of the Universe. Controversially, she is 
an artist/scientist of few words, yet still a master of the run-on 
sentence.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We want to bring our wonderful piece to Burning Man (and many other places) so everyone can interact with it!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>AudioOracle is a pyramid-shaped structure with two levels.  It is solar powered and constructed from mostly repurposed, salvaged, and recycled materials.  <br/></p>
<p>When participants enter the first level, they will see a post with a microphone, a button, and directions.  At the press of the button, anything the participant wishes to say will be recorded.  After they go up the ladder to the second level, they will see a seated, shrouded figure.  This is the Oracle.  There is another button in front of the Oracle (and some very simple directions).  When the participant presses the button, a recording is randomly selected from all of the recordings other participants have made, and played for the current participant.  This means that voice matters in the world, and that every participant's voice matters, 
regardless of age, gender, race, class, or any  other of those 
irrelevancies that divide us in our day to day lives.  The element of randomness should provide for much synchronicity and delight, as well as many surprises!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we cannot get funding for this campaign, we most likely will not be able to complete construction, and we will not be able to bring our piece to Burning Man.  $1000 will cover all of our costs, down to transport to and from the event (though not transport to other places we are hoping to set it up).<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Materials list and estimated cost (where applicable):</p>
<p>Used laptop: gifted!<br/></p>
<p>Plexiglass/plastic sheets: salvaged</p>
<p>Screws: $5</p>
<p>Wiring caps: $8<br/></p>
<p>Staples: $10<br/></p>

<p>Cords for electronics: gifted!</p>
<p>LEDs: salvaged</p>
<p>Wood: salvaged, possible purchase of 2x4s<br/></p>
<p>Flour: $15</p>
<p>Newspaper: salvaged<br/></p>

<p>Solar setup (including panels, inverter, battery bank): $600</p>
<p>USB buttons: $20</p>
<p>Solar lights: $30<br/></p>
<p>Gas (to Burning Man, estimated): $125</p>
<p>Trailer rental: $30</p>
<p>Possible extra speaker, and possibly 2 extra USB buttons<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With projects like this, I have found there are always unforeseen costs.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Promote us!  We need the word out about our project.  Use the link above to ""like"" us on Facebook, and share this page.<br/></p>
<p>Also, if you live in the Santa Cruz or Mt. Shasta area and have materials to donate, we are looking for 2x4's, plexiglass and/or plastic sheeting, screws, and old extension cords.</p>
<p>Cheap deep cycle batteries and broken solar panels/solar cells.<br/></p>
<p>Also, since we are planning on bringing AudioOracle to Burning Man, we are always looking for lovely participants to help us set up and tear down at the event!  We appreciate any leads on tickets to the event; so far, only one team member has obtained one.<br/></p>
