<p>Malnutrition.  Depravation.  Penury. Illness.  Hunger. Disease.</p>
<p>Our group of Hispanic Healthcare and Culture students at Indiana
University Kokomo is undertaking a service-learning trip to assist an ongoing
humanitarian project in El Progreso, Guatemala. Sister Edna has dedicated her life to helping
the children of Guatemala by building and running a convalescence home
dedicated to fighting malnutrition and promoting recuperation and growth.</p>
<p>The children in this region of Guatemala are in desperate need of specialty
care. According to UNICEF, 50% of Guatemalan children under the age of 5 are
chronically malnourished, which potentially leads to stunted growth, lower IQ,
and possibly death. Malnutrition is the largest contributor to infant mortality
globally as well as in Sister Edna’s Guatemala.</p>
<p>Sister Edna has dedicated her life to helping children recover from
malnutrition.  Her recently constructed recuperation
and treatment center in eastern Guatemala is a nourishment and recovery center
for children up to ten years of age; it is an in-patient center that provides
treatment, medical care, and nutrition counseling free of charge for families
in rural communities who might not otherwise have access to care for their
children. Currently the facility can care for and house 12 children, but Sister
Edna hopes to build temporary housing for parental visitation while their
children are being treated.  The more
families and children she can help the better.</p>
<p>Last year our previous cohort raised enough money to purchase ten cribs
and a washing machine for the new center. 
This year we would like to do more, we hope to purchase kitchen
appliances to help feed the children such as a new refrigerator, stove, freezer,
or other needed appliances.  Sister Edna
hopes to help more than just the 12 children she can currently accommodate and
needs essential staples to provide care for the community. </p>
<p>We estimate the cost of the appliances at $1,500 US.  Purchased locally in Guatemala these
appliances will be delivered to the center to help Sister Edna in her mission. The
remaining $1,000 US will go towards the group’s travel expenses – anything
above and beyond our goal will go that much further to helping the hungry
children in Guatemala. Our professor has already pledged the first $250 – that
leaves $2,250! Hopefully we will surpass our goal of $2,500 US, so that we can
fill the fridge with food, purchase diapers and bottles for the young children,
and help supply the other needed staples for the center.</p>
<p>With your help and assistance we can help feed the hungry, heal the
sick, and provide solace to the suffering. 
Please help us assist Sister Edna in her very important work, support
our service-learning project in Guatemala!</p>

<p>Students and Faculty
at Big Sky High School in Missoula, MT are embarking on a cross-cultural
journey of healing, and have partnered with a filmmaker to tell the stories of
victims and survivors of condoned gun violence.<span> 
They are seeking $2000 to fund travel visas for two Mexican nationals; airfare
for these two Mexicans and their accompanying translator; airline travel of one
teacher and a high school senior to Nogales, MX; lodging; food; and a small
honorarium of $200 for our Mexican guests for speaking at the University of
Montana and Big Sky High School for the 2015 Diversity Week.</span></p>
<p>Back Story:<span>  Just past midnight on October 10, 2012, a
beloved 16-year-old Mexican boy had just met his brother after work, as he had
so many times, to walk home.  Minutes
later, Jose Antonio Rodriguez would be gunned down by US Border Patrol while
walking within Mexico. Two years later near midnight of April 26, 2014, a
popular 17-year-old foreign exchange student from Germany, Diren Dede, was shot
and killed from point blank range by shotgun in the garage of a neighbor in
quiet residential area in Missoula, Montana. 
This proposed project will tell these two parallel stories of teenage
boys gunned down with a disproportionate use of force.  <b>The
story is told by two teenage boys left behind with the trauma of these tragic
killings</b>.  Diren’s friend Chance Maes
and Jose’s brother Diego Rodriguez visit and interview each other, chronicling
the events of these tragedies, and revealing their candid and moving

<h3>School Counselor Hoping to Improve Other Educators Technology Expertise</h3>
<p>My name is Jeff and I have a passion for teaching educators how to better use technology in their schools and programs. Technology is the tools of today and the future, but our schools are under water with their budgets and do not allow training in proper use and even basics of some of the most common place 21st Century Skills.</p>
<p>I write a <a href=""http://thecounselinggeek.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">counseling and educator technology focused blog</a> to help other educators learn more about how to use these powerful tools and hopefully be able to pass that knowledge on to our students. I am looking for two things with this campaign:<strong> 1</strong> - Funds ($2500) to go towards a scholarship to bring one school a day-long Professional Development workshop focused on either <a href=""http://www.schoolcounselor.org/content.asp?contentid=302"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Data Gathering Boot-Camp</a> -OR- a <a href=""http://www.schoolcounselor.org/content.asp?contentid=386"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cyber-bullying/Internet Safety workshop</a>. Both programs are excellent opportunities to be taught by leaders in the field offered by the <a href=""http://www.schoolcounselor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">American School Counselor Association (ASCA)</a>, which most educators will not get on their own and<strong> 2</strong> - Funding to help me get my own domain for my blog (~$10-$20) and some funds to promote the blog to increase exposure (~$100-200).</p>
<p>Any funds above the $2900 (or if we do not reach $2900 - the entire amount raised) will be put towards<strong> funding scholarships for counselors to attend the 2013 ASCA National Conference</strong>.</p>
<p>I plan on hosting a scholarship technology contest in which counselors will apply for the funds by learning about and utilize technology to talk about why they would like this professional development opportunity and how it can effect their programs, schools, and students.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>When I was a kid, my dad made me an elaborate bank system using nothing but plastic boxes and a label maker. In my ""savings"" box, he assigned a percentage I would gain each month in interest and showed me how to ""deposit"" and ""withdraw"" when I wanted to. It may seem like a small lesson, but I learned so much about money, banks and life in general with such a simple tool.  Not too long ago my father passed away very suddenly, and on that day, I lost not only a father but a best friend. So as a tribute to him, I'm creating an online version of that bank for parents to help teach their kids about money and show them what this looks like in the real world.</p>
<p>If you help by contributing to this project and sharing Mint Junior with everyone you know, it will allow us to help educate children all over the world on the basics of managing money. It's such an invaluable tool to have and if the next generation gets it, there will less US debt and a richer, happier economy for generations to come!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising $2,000</p>
<ul>
<li>$700 for the advanced developtment that I don't have the skills to do and</li>
<li>The rest will be used for advertising and marketing Mint Junior.  </li>
</ul>
<p>So far we have a few options and perks for contributing, including a free lifetime membership to Mint Junior for you or a friend, recognition on Mint Junior's ""Funders Page,"" and Mint Junior Tees! </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal of $2,000 we will use everything - whatever we get - to develop the site.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Knowing how to manage money is such an important part of life, but so few children learn about money in a healthy way. Shoot - how many adults do you know who know how to manage their money properly? Parents are so stressed and overworked today, it's tough to figure out ways of teaching kids about one of life's most essential aspects... that's where Mint Junior comes in, but only with your help!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help!</h3>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
When I was a kid, my dad made me an elaborate bank system using nothing but plastic boxes and a label maker. In my ""savings"" box, he assigned a percentage I would gain each month in interest and showed me how to ""deposit"" and ""withdraw"" when I wanted to. It may seem like a small lesson, but I learned so much about money, banks and life in general with such a simple tool.  Not too long ago my father passed away very suddenly, and on that day, I lost not only a father but a best friend. So as a tribute to him, I'm creating an online version of that bank for parents to help teach their kids about money and show them what this looks like in the real world.
If you help by contributing to this project and sharing Mint Junior with everyone you know, it will allow us to help educate children all over the world on the basics of managing money. It's such an invaluable tool to have and if the next generation gets it, there will less US debt and a richer, happier economy for generations to come!


What We Need & What You Get
We are raising $2,000

$700 for the advanced developtment that I don't have the skills to do and
The rest will be used for advertising and marketing Mint Junior.  

So far we have a few options and perks for contributing, including a free lifetime membership to Mint Junior for you or a friend, recognition on Mint Junior's ""Funders Page,"" and Mint Junior Tees! 
If we do not reach our goal of $2,000 we will use everything - whatever we get - to develop the site.


The Impact
Knowing how to manage money is such an important part of life, but so few children learn about money in a healthy way. Shoot - how many adults do you know who know how to manage their money properly? Parents are so stressed and overworked today, it's tough to figure out ways of teaching kids about one of life's most essential aspects... that's where Mint Junior comes in, but only with your help!


Other Ways You Can Help!
Some people just can’t contribute, and hey - that's cool! But, that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

<p>No need to panic, we're not sending kids to the Moon. First, it is way too expensive to raise that kind of cash. Second, we probably couldn't get parents to sign the waivers and permission slips. No, we're talking about students coming up with creative ideas for payloads based on robotic rover missions intended to roam on the surface of the Moon! Unlike sending humans into space, it is easier (but not easy) for private companies and universities to design, build, and launch robots to land on the Moon and do great innovative things. We're working with one of those companies, Astrobotic Technology, which has plans to send a robotic rover to the lunar surface to explore lunar lava tubes late in 2015. Penn State's Lunar Lions and Team JURBAN Google Lunar X Prize teams have also agreed to participate with their missions. Student teams work with us and Astrobotic/Penn State/JURBAN to come up with creative ideas for payloads designed for their Moon spacecraft. Of course, that takes support (yes, funds) to accomplish so we're here to ask for your help to take our pilot program and make it into a fun, easily accessible project (called the Moon Mission Challenge) in which any middle or high school team can participate. Our goal is to make this available to any team, regardless of location or socioeconomic situation.</p>
<p>First, let's give you a guided tour of MMC. </p>
<h3>What is the Moon Mission Challenge (MMC)?</h3>
<p>We want to inspire students to reach for the stars in whatever they do in life.  Innovate Our World created a STEAM (STEM &amp; Arts) challenge that would inspire kids to think innovatively and show them that they can do great things working together as a team.  The MMC does just that - it gives middle/high school students an opportunity to come up with an innovative payload idea for planned lunar robotic landers, one of which is planned for flight to the Moon in late 2015. </p>
<p>Before kids can design something for the Moon, they need to know all about the Moon. Our learning partner Immersive-3D has developed a cool Cyber STEM Academy where students can learn what it's like to live and operate on the Moon at their own pace in a game-like environment. Hey, teachers like this too because they don't have to deliver the basics; they can focus on project and team activities, like coming up with some brilliant ideas for a lunar payload.</p>
<p>Working with the engineers at Astrobotic Technology and advisers at Penn State, student teams will design a payload to fit onto one of our partner's Google Lunar X Prize lunar robotic rovers and ""sell"" their concept to a team of NASA, industry, and academic experts at our Challenge event in April 2014, which will be held with the USA Science and Engineering Festival at the Washington, DC Convention Center.  The benefits to the students are wide, ranging from building skills they can use in college and career to exposure to college, industry, and government representatives that can help them down the road.</p>
<p>But first, we need your help doing this.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get this ready for prime time for January 2014, much work needs to be done moving existing content over to the cyberacademy, developing new content, and helping out schools financially, especially those that qualify for the final capstone event. Schools pay nothing; it all comes from donations.We're looking for a minimum of a dozen teams but the more money we raise, the more teams we can financially support and the more cool stuff we can add to the interactive learning environment.  We are working to include as many socioeconomically disadvantaged teams as possible so your contributions will go to fund those teams first.</p>
<p>Check out our perks!  We think the eBooks are great because you can see the product of your contribution.  Tours are even better as you can see robots in action! Of course, you can be a star to the kids by sponsoring a school or becoming a Challenge judge.  We see all contributors as stars and each of you is very much appreciated.</p>
<h3>Become a Superstar of Referral! Get Invited to a Cool Party (Really)!</h3>
<p>We're looking for those superstars of donations, you know, those who can shame, I mean get their friends, families, and colleagues to help out. You know who you are, the person who raises beaucoup bucks for causes. We want you to apply your awesome talents to this worthy cause as well. We make it easy to refer other donors, plus we have extra rewards based on the number of donors you refer<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. Just refer them to our crowdfunding campaign and have them complete the referral form on our site at <a href=""http://www.innovateourworld.org/supporters."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.innovateourworld.org/supporters.</a> When they make their Indiegogo contribution, we will link their donation to your referral and you'll receive the following:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>• Extra donor gift with your existing reward<br/>• Additional entries into a weekly prize drawing (one entry per referral). Weekly prizes include autographed space books, videos, and more!</p>For those who go beyond the call, we have special rewards for you! To honor the original American space program, we have three referral levels.<p></p>
<p>Mercury Crew - Become a member of the Crew with just 3 referrals. As you may know, the Mercury capsule carried one astronaut aloft in orbit. Well, squeeze tight because you and 3 (or more) of your friends are now taking this ride together - and we really appreciate it. As a Crew member, you'll get a space-related pack worth at least $50.</p>
<p>Gemini Boosters - with at least 6 referrals, you become one of our awesome boosters. You bring the power to get the MMC released from the bonds of Earth's gravity (or something like that). You are outspoken, passionate, and energetic - just what we need to raise money for students. For this level, you'll get a space-related pack worth at least $75.</p>
<p>Apollo Aces - WOW, you're the cat's meow! You've gotten 10 or more people to contribute and we're very grateful. For your extraordinary effort, you'll get a space-related pack worth at least $100!</p>
<p>It just gets better! The top three referrers (by amount donated) will receive a special reward to be announced during the campaign. Oh, and one more perk.<br/></p>
<p>All Crew, Boosters, and Aces referrers be invited to our Donor Dinner next year at the Engineer's Club in Baltimore, MD. If you can't make it, designate someone to attend for you. You'll receive special recognition plus some neat swag. Plus the Engineer's Club is a fantastic historic venue with old world charm. We're looking forward to meeting you!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Why This is Important</h3>
<p>Students need inspiration to do great things.  They also need to see the practical skills required for the workplace.  MMC is the only middle/high school challenge connecting kids to industry experts and an actual mission to the Moon!  Moon Mission Challenge winners will receive prize money they can use for their education plus an opportunity to enter the Conrad Foundation Spirit of Innovation (SoI) Awards challenge.  SoI gives student winners funds for taking their great idea to further heights. </p>
<p>MMC is a great extracurricular for students to put on their college resumes so they can get into the college that's right for them and get that great start.</p>
<p>Here's a recommendation from Kaan Balimtas, who was a member of one of our pilot program schools in 2011:</p>
<p>""Joining the mission was one of the most useful experiences I had during high school because it enabled me to gain hands-on experience with large scale projects. The same communication and analytical skill-set is vital whether it is planning the design and feasibility of a payload or finding the right investor and financing deal that fits a company's growth plan. This type of immersion tremendously helps with career-readiness and, I found, can be applied to a wide range of careers including science, engineering, consulting, and investment banking.""</p>

<h3>The Journey to Convention 2013</h3>
<p>Our chapter has always been a small chapter and every year we have looked forward to sending our members to the National Convention, which helps expose us to awesome opportunities that you would have to be there in order to experience them!</p>
<p>The National Convention holds such promise and excitement for high school and collegiate students as well as current professionals of this organization. Every year we gather in one place at the same time for the same purpose that will unite us, fuel our passions and move us forward.</p>
<p>NSBE is an organization whose mission is brought to life through our membership. The convention enables us to network with membership at all levels. It gives us opportunities to obtain scholarships, be recognized for our excellence in academics, leadership, community impact and professionalism. </p>
<p>At our stage in life where can we go that will allow us to meet CEOs, Presidents and Vice Presidents of Fortune 500 companies? Where can we go that will allow us to network in a room of over 150 employers with the possibility of obtaining internships and full time positions? Where can we go and be surrounded by equally passionate and driven individuals hungry for success? Well here's the answer - the NSBE Annual Convention 2013 in Indianapolis, Indiana.</p>
<p>We are the Virginia Commonwealth University Chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers.  We are focused on helping to enhance the lives of our membership through professional and academic excellence. Help us become the future engineers and scientists that we've always dreamed of becoming! Help us get to Convention 2013!</p>

<h3>About 721K Cares</h3>
<p>721K Cares is an initiative to bring relief to our students and staff directly victimized by the devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy. Our school is located approximately one mile away from the Coney Island boardwalk, and many of our students and coworkers have lost their homes and possessions. Our school community will be brainstorming relief items that people need, buying the proper materials and supplies for care packages, assembling the care packages, and finally, delivering care packages to those who urgently need relief in our school community, including students and staff directly affected by Hurricane Sandy.</p>
<p>We are a special education high school in South Brooklyn, New York. We service students with intellectual disabilities, such as Down's Syndrome, Autism, Cerebral Palsy, and other developmental disabilities. Our focus is to impart functional and vocational skills through hands-on activities that prepare them for life after high school, while allowing them to explore their unique interests and talents. </p>
<p>By supporting this initiative, you are supporting not only direct relief efforts, but also the overarching goal of providing students with hands-on, real life volunteer experience. Our students are highly capable, but are often not given the chances they deserve in terms of vocational opportunities. When you donate to 721K Cares, you are making a direct impact on Sandy victims and our students. Your help in meeting this dual goal is much appreciated on so many levels!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>721K Cares: The Impact</h3>
<p>721K Cares needs at least $10,000 to buy the necessary essentials to help our affected students and staff get back on their feet. Your donations will directly fund purchases toward clothing (socks, shoes, underwear, shirts, pants, outerwear), food, blankets, and other essential items needed at this time. So many in our school community lost everything, and need the every day items that we tend to take for granted. Your donations allow for teachers, staff, and students to start to rebuild their lives. Even if we don't reach our entire goal, every little bit counts and will go toward direct relief efforts!</p>
<p>When you donate, you will receive a handwritten thank you card from one of our students. Our entire school community is appreciative of your help, and we thank you for your support during this difficult time.</p>

<p>Two years ago, our study abroad program at the University of Georgia set out on an experience of a lifetime to South Africa.  From studying at Stellenbosch University to seeing the sights of Table Mountain, it was a remarkable experience.  The most impactful and enriching part of our adventure, however, was working in the township of Kayamandi, which the name in the Xhosa language means ""sweet home"".  A remnant of South Africa's apartheid past, Kayamani is a town of incredible people who work together as a community to make their lives better.  Volunteering alongside teachers in the crèches (daycares) as well as instructors in the town library really built a lasting bond between our group and the residents of Kayamandi.</p>
<p><span>Upon returning home, we founded the organization ""Ubuntu at UGA"".  Ubuntu, which is defined by the Bantu phrase ""I am because you are"", explains the connection between us and Kayamandi. Being part of a global community implores you to help others in times of difficulty.  That is why we have decided to launch this campaign in light of recent events.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Fire and What We Can Do</h3>
<p>On March 15th, 2013 in the early morning, a fire broke out in Kayamandi, sweeping through the densely-packed township. When the fire was extinguished, two people had died, more than 1,300 shacks were destroyed, and close to 4,000 people were displaced.  The rapid spread and high intensity of the fire left residents without any time to save belongings. In a small community like this, a house could also be a small business, further adding to the impact. As people who have been to and worked in Kayamandi, we feel compelled to act.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Money raised by this campaign will go to organizations on the ground to deliver food and clothing as well as to support temporary and permanent housing efforts.  Ubuntu at UGA has a relationship with Prochorus Community Development, an organization based in Kayamandi and who we have worked with during our time in South Africa.  The people at Prochorus are dedicated and passionate about improving the lives of those living in Kayamandi.  To learn more about Prochorus, please visit <a href=""http://www.prochorus.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.prochorus.org</a></p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I mean who wouldn't right?  It's California. and she's worked with such companies as <span>Lucas Film, NBC, ABC, Tri-Star, Morgan Creek and Aaron Spelling Productions, has a background in acquistions, development, and independent distribution and has worked as producer, director, writer, editor and assistant director on shorts, commercials and features.   It's a chance of a lifetime.  </span></p>
<p>As a Veteran I am able to use the great educational program called the Post 911 GI Bill, which pays for any class where your attending college, however it is not without flaws.  They do not cover internships out of the home state where your school is located.</p>
<p>Because of that I am unable to attend this learning experience, which hinders my career aspirations.   Only with your help, would I be able to learn from the best in the location where dreams come true.</p>
<p>The Amount of money raised will go towards transportation to and from (gas), a location to live for the nearly 2 months for two, Food, and paying California utilities, (such as Parking and Elecdtric, if needed) </p>

<p>We are two talented young entrepreneurs from <a href=""http://www.stjohns.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">St. John's University</a> trying to build <a href=""http://www.kampusconnections.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KampusConnections</a>; an innovative networking website that allows college students to buy, sell and trade in order to minimize the cost of books and other expenses.</p>
<h1>The millions missing out</h1>
<p>Through repeated failures in the educational system and the skyrocketing cost of college, promising students are forced to either not attend or drop out of college at a very alarming rate of 44%. Students have lost faith in the possibilities that a quality education could help aid in the process of successfully putting their lives together. Their lack of faith stems from financial troubles.  In order to defeat this lack of faith, students must be given a sustainable way to alleviate the added stress caused by financial troubles.     </p>
<h1>What is the project about?</h1>
<p>As students at St. John's University, we found it extremely difficult to provide essential materials to others that were in need of them; especially when it came to books.  Everyone flocked to the university bookstore and paid outrageous prices for a book that was only going to be useful for about 3 months. Because university bookstores monopolize the market, when students try to re-sale their books they receive only a fraction of the value paid for the book, typically 25% or less of the purchase prices.  The bookstores then re-sell the books back to other students, receiving over 175% profit.  The current situation creates a lose-lose situation for students and a win-win situation for bookstores.  Students are looking for convenient, money saving ways to purchase textbooks and to receive more value when re-selling textbooks at the end of each semester.</p>
<p>But why was this so? Why didn't students take the initiative to find students to sell their goods to? Seems like common sense right? Right!  We later found however, that many students did try to sell their books, but had little to no success doing so. Between mid-terms, finals and other deadlines impeded on students by their professors, there was no time to mount a full search and find students in need of similar materials. As chronic thinkers and college students ourselves, we noticed this need and created a platform to connect those who weren’t connected.</p>

<p><strong>Share knowledge with others who need it, while putting money in your wallet!</strong> KampusConnections is the first and only site that bridges the gap between getting an education and funding one at the same time. When you connect with your campus, KampusConnections will enable students to buy, sell, and trade used textbooks directly to other students, by-passing the university bookstores.  By selling textbooks to other students, the seller can receive more money than the bookstore will pay and the buyer can pay less than the bookstore charges. We plan to make KampusConnections a nationwide sharing platform for college students to buy, sell, or trade with students at any campus in the nation. </p>
<p> KampusConnections will establish itself as the leading online student-to-student marketplace by combining extensive market-specific expertise with internet technologies to generate revenue while creating a win-win solution for students. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>KampusConnections will setup three distinct connection features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Have &amp; Have not’s</strong>: The Have and Have not’s is the central program of KampusConnections. Students who have books or other items they want to sell can post to students who find themselves in need of these items.</li>
<li>
<strong>Free Trade</strong>: Free Trade focuses on students who may have valuable items and accept offers for other items instead of money.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Community Connection</strong>: Community Connection engages the local vendors with the university in the area.  This enables students to know the day to day deals and specials offered by each vendor.    </li>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Kristen Pym I am a Grade 11 student in Alberta, Canada.  I have been introduced to the amazing group called Free The Children this year and want to pursue one of their volunteer trips to Kenya.  I am interested in this trip to challenge myself to grow and understand global issues better as well as to create change for the people of the Maasai Mara region of Africa.  Through fundraising and reaching my goal of 6000.00 I will be able to go on a volunteer trip with the Free The Children society to help build a school, work on a clean water project, help create sustainable income opportunities and work on a healthcare project.  The knowledge I will bring back to Canada from this trip will help me understand poverty related issues that occur in Africa but also in our own country.  I am hoping to go on my trip the summer of 2012 so I need to fundraise quickly. You can visit <a href=""http://www.metowe.com/trips/youth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.metowe.com/trips/youth</a> to view the Kenya trip experience.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This trip will impact my life immensely and will benefit not only the people of Kenya but help me to be a better  advocate in Canada for people who are facing local poverty issues.  I am hoping to learn many skills that will help me develop as a leader within my community and country.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Our Story
My name is Kristen Pym I am a Grade 11 student in Alberta, Canada.  I have been introduced to the amazing group called Free The Children this year and want to pursue one of their volunteer trips to Kenya.  I am interested in this trip to challenge myself to grow and understand global issues better as well as to create change for the people of the Maasai Mara region of Africa.  Through fundraising and reaching my goal of 6000.00 I will be able to go on a volunteer trip with the Free The Children society to help build a school, work on a clean water project, help create sustainable income opportunities and work on a healthcare project.  The knowledge I will bring back to Canada from this trip will help me understand poverty related issues that occur in Africa but also in our own country.  I am hoping to go on my trip the summer of 2012 so I need to fundraise quickly. You can visit www.metowe.com/trips/youth to view the Kenya trip experience.


The Impact
This trip will impact my life immensely and will benefit not only the people of Kenya but help me to be a better  advocate in Canada for people who are facing local poverty issues.  I am hoping to learn many skills that will help me develop as a leader within my community and country.


What We Need & What You Get

<div>For the past two years, a national literacy initiative entitled ""Si, yo puedo!"" (Yes, I can) has taught over 100,000 adults how to read for free through 15,000 volunteer-led literacy circles. About 23,000 Salvadoran high school and college students as well as community members. have volunteered their free time for this concerted effort against illiteracy. However, resources continue to be a major limitation for the program, and the Ministry of Education has issued a call to the international community to mobilize teams of volunteers to support the program.<br/><br/>When I went to El Salvador in 2009 as an elections observer, I was struck by how many adults needed to validate their vote with a fingerprint rather than a signature because they could not even sign their own name. As a teacher of many immigrant students, I witness almost daily how many parents lack the literacy skills to be active participants in their child's education.  <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I need to Raise</h3>
</div>
<div>The total cost of my plane travel, food, and housing expenses while in El Salvador will be between $1700 and $2100. My goal is to raise at least $1,000 to help cover the expense of plane travel, food, and housing. Please help me reach my goal with a contribution of $200, $100, $50, $25 or whatever you can contribute!</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I know that being part of the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador's (CISPES) first-ever Literacy Brigade will be an incredibly meaningful experience. We will meet and accompany the literacy teachers and students working hard to make both personal and national change. We will do neighborhood outreach to promote participation in the literacy program and assist the literacy volunteers. We will also meet with FMLN leaders and social movement organizations – students, teachers, farmers – to help us understand where the literacy program fits into the larger context of issues facing the country, as well as the solutions in progress.</p>

<p>My name is Megan Stinson. I am a student at Western Oregon University, majoring in Anthropology with a minor in Forensic Anthropology. I am newly married (December of 2010), and living with my husband and a roommate. If I can get this study abroad program to work, I will be graduating in June 2013 with my Bachelor's of Science. This is a REQUIREMENT for my major program. This is incredibly important to me for a number of reasons:<br/>1) It is required<br/>2) I would like to work in South America, so Spanish is essential to my future career goals<br/>3) If I can get this done, I can graduate and walk with my Mom next year<br/><br/>The program is an 8 week intensive Spanish language program, and I will recieve almost 2 years worth of Spanish credit when I return. It also will give me credit for Anthropology classes at Western, furthering my major requirements.Without these funds, I would have to clean out my savings to be able to go, which would leave my husband with not a lot to fall back on. I am having to put my job on hold, so that part of our income is already gone. I don't want to leave him in a bad situation.</p>
<p>If I can reach my goal, I would be able to afford the trip, ticket, and school fees (with the small amount of financial aid I am recieving), and have a little bit left to leave with my household to make the summer a little bit easier.</p>
<p>I am going to be sending anyone who donates at least $10 a postcard from Costa Rica (perhaps with a picture or something in it if there is a nice printer there), and for people who donate over $25, I will be looking into a nice present from Costa Rica (necklaces, shot glasses, etc.). As this is a school trip, I will not have a lot of money to spend on extravagant perks, so these are all I can offer.</p>
<p>Thank you for all of your help. I am really looking forward to this experience and every little bit helps!! Even if you aren't able to donate, I would greatly appreciate if people could help me get the word out and help me connect with people.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>What Exactly Is Going On?</h3>
<p>Think back to your days as a kid, and your favorite record (or CD, or even cassette tape!). Did you ever think to yourself, ""It would be so cool to be able to record something like this!""? Or remember that first band you and your friends started, playing Motley Crue and Meatloaf covers out in your garage. You must have wanted just to get some time in the recording studio, to be able to make an album that you could give out to your friends. Well, with your help, these thoughts could become a reality for students at the Academy at Charlemont, a small high school in Charlemont, MA. I'm Eamon Wick, a senior at Charlemont, and as a senior project, I am working to transform a small, barely used piano practice room into a high-quality, acoustically sound recording studio for student use.</p>
<h3>Who Will It Help? Is It Just For People Who Are Good At Music?</h3>
<p>The studio would in no way be only for students with a previous musical background. in fact, one of the main goals for this project is to provide a space for <strong><em>anybody</em></strong> to come in and do something musical. One day, it could be a student band that wants to record a couple of songs for a demo, and the next day it could be somebody with no musical background at all, fooling around with writing songs on a MIDI keyboard. Or, it could be a budding guitarist-songwriter who wants to lay down a perfect riff for their new song. Along with these open uses, there will also be a host of classes based on learning about the studio equipment and different recording techniques. I hope that the studio will be able to not only enhance the creative abilities of current musicians, but also help spark the interest of non-musicians to try something new.</p>
<h3>How Will This Happen?</h3>
<p>The studio will be completed in two stages</p>
<p><strong><em>Stage 1: Frequency Testing and Acoustic Treatment</em><br/></strong></p>
<div>This is the current step that we (my advisor, Dave Chalfant, and I) are working on. The purpose of this is to see how different frequencies act and reverberate throughout the room. Using software called Room EQ Wizard, we will identify the problem areas. From there, we will build acoustic panels to make the room sound as good as possible, which is necessary for accurate mixes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<em><strong>Stage 2: Setting up the</strong></em><strong> Studio</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The second stage is essentially acquiring the equipment and setting it up so it becomes a working studio. Unfortunately, some of this equipment is not terribly cheap. This is where we need your help. Your donations would go towards the purchase of this gear.</div>
<div>
<h3>What Exactly Do We Need?</h3>
<p>If needed, I can pick up a small part of the budget, but as a 17-year-old high school student, it will indeed be a small part. I have also been trying to get discounts or donations from companies, but that will in no way support the full budget.  Here is the complete, detailed budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer (preferably a used or refurbished iMac or Macbook, with Intel Processor): $500-700</li>
<li>Software (I have two choices for software, Pro Tools or Logic)
<ul>
<li>Pro Tools 9: $295</li>
<li>Logic Express: $195</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sennheiser HD203 Headphones (2 Pairs): $100</li>
<li>20-Foot XLR Cables (10): $49</li>
<li>1/4-inch Instrument Cables (8): $80</li>
<li>Components to build Studio Desk: $80</li>
<li>Mineral Wool for Bass Traps (12 Pieces): $72</li>
<li>Acoustic Foam (for 8 panels): $200</li>
<li>Hosa Little Bro 50 ft. Stage Box (for inter-room drum recording):$100</li>
<li>Lava Lamp (Necessary for every recording studio): $10</li>
<li>M-Audio 49-key MIDI Keyboard: $150</li>
</ul>
Grand total: $1,599-$1,799 (minus the Lava Lamp)</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Way You Can Help</h3>
<p>Regardless or whether you donate or not, it would be an amazing help if you could send this link to somebody else, or maybe even multiple people. If you could think of just 5 people who would be interested in this, or to whom this is relevant, and send it to them, you would be doing the students of the Academy at Charlemont a huge favor. Feel free to email me at any time wth questions, comments or anything of that nature, at ewick@charlemont.org. Thank you!</p>

The project is called ""Enlighten the future"" and aimed to help the unprivileged children believe in themselves and to show them the world of opportunities that education can open to them! </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>We care about such social issues and in order to make it more visible and significant we are going to create <b>a <a href=""http://gamechangingindonesia.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://gamechangingindonesia.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> of our travelling and volunteering</b> in Indonesia.</p>
<p>All volunteers of the project are from different countries and together we will deliver classes to children and also we will introduce our cultures in order to show the diversity of the world. </p>
<p>But the point is that good textbooks are rare in the institutions where the unprivileged children live. <b>That's why we created this campaign: we want to buy textbooks and classic literature and bring them to these institutions.</b></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
 Hello everyone! 
My name is Marina. I am from Siberian city Omsk. Me and my boyfriend Roman are going to travel 31 000 km to participate in community development project in Indonesia. The project is called ""Enlighten the future"" and aimed to help the unprivileged children believe in themselves and to show them the world of opportunities that education can open to them! 
We care about such social issues and in order to make it more visible and significant we are going to create a blog of our travelling and volunteering in Indonesia.
All volunteers of the project are from different countries and together we will deliver classes to children and also we will introduce our cultures in order to show the diversity of the world. 
But the point is that good textbooks are rare in the institutions where the unprivileged children live. That's why we created this campaign: we want to buy textbooks and classic literature and bring them to these institutions.


What We Need & What You Get
 

Where the money will go: 
During the project we will work with 10 institutions for unprivileged children. That's why we need as least:

10 sets of teaching materials (teacher books and textbooks) for classes that we will deliver to kids - at least 462 $
10 sets of classic liteterature books for children to create the interest in reading and increase educability - at least 94 $
Souvenirs that represent our culture and history to increase the tolerancy of children and show the world's diversity - at least 80 $ 

And if we add the indiegogo fees it will be 687 $ in total.
All travel expenses we cover by ourselves. We need only to collect money for children! If we don't reach the goal, our first priority will be to buy the teaching materials.

And for your contribution you will get a lot of different unique perks: 


Gratitude in our blog: we will say thank you to you in our blog about this project

Signed photos of children: we will take a picture with children and send you by email with the words of gratitude

Signed postcards from Indonesia: we will send you a postcard from Indonesia with handwritten sign

Gifts and souvenirs from Indonesia: we will send a souvenir from Indonesia; it can be a magnet, purse/wallet, trinket or something else (we'll see what could be the coolest gift from Indonesia when we are there :)

Personalized video with the words of gratitude from the project team: we will record a personalized Thank-you Video 

Video with the words of gratitude from the children: we will ask children to say what they feel about the project and your contribution to making it happen

Personalized video of the project: we will make a unique version of the final video about the project

The Impact



I have been
working in NGO for 3,5 years and social issues were always important to me. I
truly know how much such projects matter for those kids.
Enlighten the Future is a project which aims to prove that the education is the fundamental thing in building a better future of unprivileged children. All activities of this project focus on education, training, and motivation in order to create impact that will last even after the project finished.

We just want those kids to be happy! 

  Risks & Challenges 
Of course, the
language might be the problem because we don't speak Bahasa Indonesia and
children speak very poor English. Nevertheless, the hosting organization will
help us to find the way to communicate in the most effective way. 
Me and my friend
both have experience in teaching children English and we will create the
special program of education with games. Moreover, the new bright textbooks
with illustrations will help us in this process :)


  Other Ways You Can Help 
Except for
helping us to buy books for unprivileged children you can help us to create the
educational and entertainment program. 
If you know games that
children like to play (something either energetic or educational) or tasks that
help to learn English or you have delivered English lessons and want to share
you materials,we will appreciate it very much!

am reaching out to you for a donation towards the purpose of starting a mobile library for <b>youth</b> currently and formerly incarcerated in Cape Town prisons, such as Pollsmoor, Brandvlei, and Drakenstein Prisons. The idea for

</b></p>
<p><b>Current access </b>to literature in most Cape Town prisons is inconsistent and dependent on staff willingness to provide the service. Also, libraries are stocked haphazardly, resulting in a lack of interest in them and even discouragement from reading. I, supported by research on the topic, believe that access to literature is fundamental in the transformation of lives, both by improving academic levels and by providing a creative and therapeutic outlet. This project directly fosters social and cultural <b>growth</b> amongst some of South Africa’s most disadvantaged young individuals. Moreover, being enabled ""to take part in cultural activities and education aimed at the full development of the human personality” is a recommended <b>right</b> of prisoners, as put forth by the UN in their resolution ""Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners"" (UNGA resolution 45/111).</p>
<p><b>YiPSA</b>
is an international non-profit organization that seeks to prepare youth in
conflict with law in making the transition from incarceration back into
society, by using a unique methodology of teaching life skills using creative
and performing arts, sports and literacy. YiPSA looks at <b>rehabilitation</b>
<b>holistically</b> from the perspective of the individual, community and

<h2><strong>What are we doing?</strong></h2>
<p>We are helping social organizations amplify their positive impact in the communities they serve. We are empowering social entrepreneurs in Africa and South Africa. We are helping young business leaders become better ones. We are promoting responsible leadership. We are improving the lives of thousands of people. <a href=""http://www.csrwire.com/blog/posts/647-the-ripple-effect-can-students-drive-long-lasting-positive-change"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">This is The Ripple Effect.</a></p>
<h2><strong>What are we going to do with $50,000?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Increase our partnerships in developing communities and help them solve poverty-related issues. This means more organizations we can help, thus helping more and in a better way the groups they serve.</li>
<li>Take more Emzingo fellows where they’re needed and promote responsible leadership. The more fellows we place, the more people we can reach and help.</li>
<li>And continue to empower and promote socially responsible entrepreneurship around the globe. Social entrepreneurs can improve the life of a community; they generate economic growth and can alleviate poverty.</li>
</ul><h2><strong>Why this campaign?</strong></h2>
<p>We are convinced the Emzingo model is something that should go beyond the people who are directly involved and we know it can be attractive to an open, international community of young, active individuals who believe in making the world a better place by working together and conquering their dreams.</p>
<p>This is why, we’ve decided to use Indiegogo, a popular, open, international, modern and democratic platform to help us raise awareness and reach our fundraising goal. By doing so, we can allow others within our Emzingo community be a direct part of our growth and join our movement, but also spread the word to others who don’t know about the work we do. We know it’s not easy, but we also know together, we can make it happen.</p>
<p>We are so convinced of the importance of the Emzingo program, that we launched an “all or nothing” campaign. <strong>What this means is that, if we do not reach our goal by the end of the campaign, all contributions will be automatically returned to all of the funders. The support and opportunity to directly benefit the communities in which we serve will be lost.</strong></p>
<h2>If I fund your project what do I get?</h2>
<p>Besides the satisfaction of knowing that you are actually directly improving the lives of people around the world, depending on your contribution you'll receive a perk. For example:</p>

<h2><strong>BE A CHANGE-MAKER</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>EMZINGO: THE BEGINING OF THE DREAM</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Madrid, Spain. 2008.</strong></p>
<p>Emzingo started, as most life-changing projects do, at a meeting among friends… While completing their MBA program in Madrid, three IE Business School students, Ramon, Amani and Drew, realized they shared a stubborn commitment towards changing the <em>status quo</em> in ways that would promote long-term social development.</p>
<p>Determined to turn their dreams into reality, they put themselves to work and after only a few months, the first Emzingo program was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. Emzingo was ready to make real, long-lasting change and hasn’t stopped since, bringing on-board Daniel, Pablo, and Chris to continue its mission.</p>

<h3><strong>EMZINGO: A MAGIC CIRCLE</strong></h3>
<p>The word Emzingo comes from the Swahili word ""M’zingo"" which means ""Circumference/Circle"" and is used to describe ""Community"".</p>
<p>We chose this name because we believe in building a world where business leaders and organizations are committed to integrating social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and financial success; an “M’zingo” world where we learn from one another and work together towards a more prosperous, empowered, and inclusive society.</p>

<li>We address some of the most challenging issues including but not limited to poverty eradication, HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, social enterprises development, environmental preservation, and the promotion of gender equality;</li>

What are we doing?
We are helping social organizations amplify their positive impact in the communities they serve. We are empowering social entrepreneurs in Africa and South Africa. We are helping young business leaders become better ones. We are promoting responsible leadership. We are improving the lives of thousands of people. This is The Ripple Effect.
What are we going to do with $50,000?

Increase our partnerships in developing communities and help them solve poverty-related issues. This means more organizations we can help, thus helping more and in a better way the groups they serve.
Take more Emzingo fellows where they’re needed and promote responsible leadership. The more fellows we place, the more people we can reach and help.
And continue to empower and promote socially responsible entrepreneurship around the globe. Social entrepreneurs can improve the life of a community; they generate economic growth and can alleviate poverty.
Why this campaign?
We are convinced the Emzingo model is something that should go beyond the people who are directly involved and we know it can be attractive to an open, international community of young, active individuals who believe in making the world a better place by working together and conquering their dreams.
This is why, we’ve decided to use Indiegogo, a popular, open, international, modern and democratic platform to help us raise awareness and reach our fundraising goal. By doing so, we can allow others within our Emzingo community be a direct part of our growth and join our movement, but also spread the word to others who don’t know about the work we do. We know it’s not easy, but we also know together, we can make it happen.
We are so convinced of the importance of the Emzingo program, that we launched an “all or nothing” campaign. What this means is that, if we do not reach our goal by the end of the campaign, all contributions will be automatically returned to all of the funders. The support and opportunity to directly benefit the communities in which we serve will be lost.
If I fund your project what do I get?
Besides the satisfaction of knowing that you are actually directly improving the lives of people around the world, depending on your contribution you'll receive a perk. For example:
 A Shwe Shwe Doll from South Africa.
 A peruvian handy-craft from a field partner.
Or even visit one of our programs in South Africa or Peru in 2013! How amazing would that be?!?
BE A CHANGE-MAKER
EMZINGO: THE BEGINING OF THE DREAM
Madrid, Spain. 2008.
Emzingo started, as most life-changing projects do, at a meeting among friends… While completing their MBA program in Madrid, three IE Business School students, Ramon, Amani and Drew, realized they shared a stubborn commitment towards changing the status quo in ways that would promote long-term social development.
Determined to turn their dreams into reality, they put themselves to work and after only a few months, the first Emzingo program was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. Emzingo was ready to make real, long-lasting change and hasn’t stopped since, bringing on-board Daniel, Pablo, and Chris to continue its mission.
         
EMZINGO: A MAGIC CIRCLE
The word Emzingo comes from the Swahili word ""M’zingo"" which means ""Circumference/Circle"" and is used to describe ""Community"".
We chose this name because we believe in building a world where business leaders and organizations are committed to integrating social responsibility, environmental sustainability, and financial success; an “M’zingo” world where we learn from one another and work together towards a more prosperous, empowered, and inclusive society.
      
HOW WE MAKE REAL, LASTING CHANGE

We look for amazing non-profits and social enterprises from around the world and work with them to amplify their impact in their communities;
We bring together some of the world’s most promising leaders from the business, academic, and social sectors to work together on socially and environmentally responsible projects;
We address some of the most challenging issues including but not limited to poverty eradication, HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, social enterprises development, environmental preservation, and the promotion of gender equality;
We’ve already worked hand-in-hand with nearly 30 local field partners in South Africa and Peru to help tackle some of the fundamental challenges these communities face, but we’re not done!
WE WON’T SETTLE
We’ve come a long way, but we know this is only the beginning of long-term social impact.
We are now committed to raising over one million dollars within the next three years to further expand our programs, reaching even more developing communities around the world, but only you can help make that happen!
CONTRIBUTE. SPREAD THE WORD.  BE A CHANGE-MAKER.
To kick-start this exciting journey, we’re launching an inspiring crowd funding campaign aiming to raise awareness and the first $50,000. Become part of the Emzingo community and together we can take a step towards changing the lives of millions of people… Together we can make it happen!

We have found that most of the force is felt on the head. That led us to design the G6… to give you an immersive feel of the virtual vehicle.

<span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6em;"">
This is because the weight of the head makes the neck muscles work harder, and this is also felt by the inner ear which is the main “sensor” of balance and movement of the human body.

Almost all race car drivers did not like racing games because they did not provide enough realism as compared to their real race cars.

Since most people are not race car drivers or gaming enthusiasts we needed the opinion of everyday drivers. We wanted to know if the interface helped them in any way, did they find it useful, stressful, was it an add-on or just an unwanted feature of the game. The opinions were pretty unanimous and again:

During testing we wanted to see if an everyday driver would notice that the force from the interface was suddenly gone. So for each of them, we secretly disconnected the power to the interface. All noticed that something just disappeared from the game; they lost the feel for speed and they started to crash … the interface was something that helped them in the game.

Before, when my mom saw my dad playing racing game she said: “I will not get in a car again with you :)” every time he crashed the car. After, they both had a try with the G6 prototype their driving trust issues improved.

The simulator interface (G6) creates a feel of movement by providing the forces which are calculated from the game physics. This deepens the feeling of reality of the simulation as the forces are experienced on the head similar to those felt in a real race car.

<br/><p>
<span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6em;"">
The interface is attached to the driver seat base and is connected to the helmet. The interface exerts forces that are aimed to be equal to the forces of a race car (lower force settings for novice are recommended). It is the only simulator where you will be able to feel the full acceleration of a F1 car which can produce up to 6 G of lateral force.

<span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6em;"">
The interface works as a force feedback device. It does not make the head move to a certain position but exerts force on the head no matter in what position the head is.

</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6em;"">
In the past few years we have built several gaming stations aimed at increasing the level of reality the driver/gamer experiences. We found that we still could not feel the forces of the car, and therefore we started to develop our own force feedback interface.

Full body simulators.
</span>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6em;"">
We wanted to delve into full body movement simulators but found these to be overly expensive and slow in response to the point that they made the driver motion sick. Motion sickness occurs when there is a time delay between what is seen and what is felt. With full body simulators something in the game happens (is seen) before the simulator can move to the proper position.

During our research we also discovered that most of the force when driving a race car is felt on the head since this is not fixed in the car (this is also the main reason F1 pilots train their neck muscles to sustain the cornering, accelerating and braking forces on their bodies). When we understood this we built a simulator that exerts forces on the head of the person in the simulator and has the lowest possible time delay of response.

</p></div>","“I like fast cars, I like the power they produce, the feeling of acceleration… It gets the adrenalin running through my veins…” 

Aleš Zajc, G6 designer and founder of Gravitom.



If you like fast cars or enjoy racing games you came to the right place…




“Project Cars – sim racing game”





At Gravitom we developed an interface that will make you feel the same kind of excitement that you would get driving a real race car. 




You will feel the force of a race car!




With our force feedback interface not only will you improve your gaming skills, you will also explore your potential and find your edge when driving outside of the game. We are making it real with the Gravitom G6.




The


 G6 is the world’s first simulator which lets you experience the forces of a F1 car.






WHAT


IS THE G6?




The G6 is a head mounted force feedback interface. Simply put… it is a driving simulator which lets you feel the forces of the car.




WHY


ON YOUR HEAD?




Let us do a test. Shake your arm, leg and your head. Where did you feel most of the force?




We have found that most of the force is felt on the head. That led us to design the G6… to give you an immersive feel of the virtual vehicle.




This is because the weight of the head makes the neck muscles work harder, and this is also felt by the inner ear which is the main “sensor” of balance and movement of the human body.




WHY


NOT ON THE WHOLE BODY?
 




The Facts…






Most of the force is felt on the head, not on the body





Price - Smaller construction and smaller motors reduce the price





Larger forces (up to 6 g) can be simulated with a head force feedback interface but not with a full body interface





Forces can be simulated more accurately – fast response, no delay! (read more below)





The 6G can be integrated in any racing cockpit





“Source: High Acceleration and the Human Body, Martin Voshell, November 28, 2004”




IS


THIS THE NEXT STEP?


YES!




For racing games and simulators a major step was taken when the first racing steering wheels became available, this occurred again with the appearance of the steering wheels with force feedback. 




The next step is here, the G6. 




AFFORDABLE 

PRICE

SIMPLE

TO USE

PLUG

AND PLAY


WORKING

ON 8 GAMES




Our device creates the sensation and feeling of movement. With the G6 you will feel the car, you will feel the track, the grass, the bumps on the road …




It may just be a game,


but it will make you sweat.
 



""Photo: Driver sweats after 15 min using our interface.""





The feeling is indescribable. You drive the car, you see the road, hear the engine, feel the steering… and you feel the excitement and adrenalin… the force.





Feel the excitement 





Feel the adrenalin





Find your potential 





Get the best from your game





User


experience / Results




We tested the G6 prototype with as different types as we could to get the feedback we needed to give you the best experience possible. We did not want only gamers testing the interface since all of them said it was “cool”, “awesome” “I want one”, etc. 




More important than just trying the interface ourselves and other game enthusiasts, we wanted to get feedback from all types of drivers from professional race car drivers to the everyday driver. Here is what we got …






Race car drivers say…







Almost all race car drivers did not like racing games because they did not provide enough realism as compared to their real race cars. Again … they said that something was missing … For the game / simulation to have a meaning to them it had to have more feel. When using the G6 prototype most of them found that:





They now felt the force of the car.





It gave them a better feel and control over the car in the game.





They learned to handle the car faster (better learning curve).





They crashed less.





… most of all … They enjoyed it and wanted another try.






Race car drivers gave us great feedback on how to set up the G6, they will be back testing it with us, to get it as real as possible.






Moms and dads say…







Since most people are not race car drivers or gaming enthusiasts we needed the opinion of everyday drivers. We wanted to know if the interface helped them in any way, did they find it useful, stressful, was it an add-on or just an unwanted feature of the game. The opinions were pretty unanimous and again:





our interface made the game feel more real





their game driving (and real driving) improved





race times fell even with novice gamers





… they would use the interface






Quote (by friend): “Turn it back on, it’s just a game without it…”





During testing we wanted to see if an everyday driver would notice that the force from the interface was suddenly gone. So for each of them, we secretly disconnected the power to the interface. All noticed that something just disappeared from the game; they lost the feel for speed and they started to crash … the interface was something that helped them in the game.




“RaceRoom Racing Experience – sim racing game”






Before, when my mom saw my dad playing racing game she said: “I will not get in a car again with you :)” every time he crashed the car. After, they both had a try with the G6 prototype their driving trust issues improved.





How


it actually works…





The simulator interface (G6) creates a feel of movement by providing the forces which are calculated from the game physics. This deepens the feeling of reality of the simulation as the forces are experienced on the head similar to those felt in a real race car. 






The interface is attached to the driver seat base and is connected to the helmet. The interface exerts forces that are aimed to be equal to the forces of a race car (lower force settings for novice are recommended). It is the only simulator where you will be able to feel the full acceleration of a F1 car which can produce up to 6 G of lateral force.






The interface works as a force feedback device. It does not make the head move to a certain position but exerts force on the head no matter in what position the head is. 




Comparison Table





The G6 interface is built using custom designed high torque and high speed actuators which make it possible for the force to be without delay 


(no more motion sickness)


and the force generated is true scale.





Research


 … before the G6.
 



In the past few years we have built several gaming stations aimed at increasing the level of reality the driver/gamer experiences. We found that we still could not feel the forces of the car, and therefore we started to develop our own force feedback interface.





Full body simulators.





We wanted to delve into full body movement simulators but found these to be overly expensive and slow in response to the point that they made the driver motion sick. Motion sickness occurs when there is a time delay between what is seen and what is felt. With full body simulators something in the game happens (is seen) before the simulator can move to the proper position.





Source link: The Telegraph written by Tom Cary




During our research we also discovered that most of the force when driving a race car is felt on the head since this is not fixed in the car (this is also the main reason F1 pilots train their neck muscles to sustain the cornering, accelerating and braking forces on their bodies). When we understood this we built a simulator that exerts forces on the head of the person in the simulator and has the lowest possible time delay of response.

What type of input will I use to connect the G6 to my computer?





G6 uses standard USB port.





Will G6 offer a warranty or support?





We guarantee that you will receive a working G6 simulator that will support the 8 already listed games.





What are the minimum system requirements for the G6?





There are no minimum specifications, though the more powerful the computer, the better the experience will be. Any standard computer should be sufficient, as long as the game you wish to use the G6 with works.





Can I wear glasses while using the G6?





So far people who tried the G6 and had glasses on did not feel any discomfort or had other difficulties.





Will my favorite game work with the G6?





So far we have 8 titles supported, but our goal is to make every racing game work with the G6.





Will the G6 work with my Xbox 360/Xbox one, PS3/PS4, Wii, or next gen console?





Not yet. We are aiming to deliver the experience to all platforms. So far the Indiegogo campaign is for PC – Windows only.





What will the Developer SDK include?





You will get fully functional code and well documented examples. You will be able to easily implement these into any software that you so desire.





Could you provide a picture of the Indiegogo prototype G6?





Not yet, we are still finalizing the hardware design and outer style of the G6.

<p>bookBgone is a socially responsible, environmentally proactive, book-loving, for-profit business founded by long-time friends Lois Cantwell and Andrea Hirschfeld.  </p>
<p>When bookBgone enters its third year of existence, in June 2013, we will have redistributed almost 200 tons of books and media – we figure that to be in the neighborhood of 400,000 books. That’s a LOT OF BOOKS! </p>
<p>We have picked up hundreds of boxes of books from local-area front doors and driveways and sent along thousands of books to food banks, community centers, and literacy programs, to troops and veterans, to prisoners, schools and day care centers, half-way houses, houses of worship, teen moms, hospitals and home visit programs, and arts programs. We send to groups and individuals and to local thrift shops. And we do this all at our own expense -- at no cost to participants on either end.</p>
<p>bookBgone has been featured in various magazines, newspapers and online for its environmental and literacy initiatives and has been recognized by the State of New Jersey and Millburn Township for community service.</p>
<h2><strong>How can we do this?</strong></h2>
<p>While bookBgone is able to place about 85% of the books that we pick up and recycle the very small percentage of books that are too wet, damaged or moldy to pass along -- approximately 12% of the books and/or media are sold. Those proceeds fund our programs.</p>
<p>While we concentrate our book giving on tri-state area organizations (where we can drive and drop the boxes) we also send books across the country to Oregon, Wisconsin, Missouri, Michigan, Texas, Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina and Maine to name a few locations, as well as to APO addresses. So far we have relied on a little help from our friends to offset the cost of packing and shipping.</p>
<p>Each box of books we send goes via media mail and costs between $10 and $15 to ship, each pick up and drop off has associated costs of gas, materials and wear and tear to our vehicles and ourselves.</p>
<h2><strong>How much does this cost?</strong></h2>

<p> </p></div>","What is bookBgone?
bookBgone is a socially responsible, environmentally proactive, book-loving, for-profit business founded by long-time friends Lois Cantwell and Andrea Hirschfeld.  
When bookBgone enters its third year of existence, in June 2013, we will have redistributed almost 200 tons of books and media – we figure that to be in the neighborhood of 400,000 books. That’s a LOT OF BOOKS! 
We have picked up hundreds of boxes of books from local-area front doors and driveways and sent along thousands of books to food banks, community centers, and literacy programs, to troops and veterans, to prisoners, schools and day care centers, half-way houses, houses of worship, teen moms, hospitals and home visit programs, and arts programs. We send to groups and individuals and to local thrift shops. And we do this all at our own expense -- at no cost to participants on either end.
bookBgone has been featured in various magazines, newspapers and online for its environmental and literacy initiatives and has been recognized by the State of New Jersey and Millburn Township for community service.
How can we do this?
While bookBgone is able to place about 85% of the books that we pick up and recycle the very small percentage of books that are too wet, damaged or moldy to pass along -- approximately 12% of the books and/or media are sold. Those proceeds fund our programs.
While we concentrate our book giving on tri-state area organizations (where we can drive and drop the boxes) we also send books across the country to Oregon, Wisconsin, Missouri, Michigan, Texas, Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina and Maine to name a few locations, as well as to APO addresses. So far we have relied on a little help from our friends to offset the cost of packing and shipping.
Each box of books we send goes via media mail and costs between $10 and $15 to ship, each pick up and drop off has associated costs of gas, materials and wear and tear to our vehicles and ourselves.
How much does this cost?
We have spent approximately $5000 on shipping (alone) last year and are projecting $7500 next year. If every person we've picked up from pledged $10, we'd be able to even expand our efforts.
How can you help?
Any amount you can send, no matter how small or large, will further our efforts. $10 will send a box of books to troops stationed overseas or to a senior citizen center in Kentucky.  $30 sponsors a day of local pick ups.  $50 pays for a book drop off at Bed-Stuy Fights Against Hunger food pantry in Brooklyn, NY.  $100 will help defray the cost of a truck rental to pick up and then deliver large quantities of books to disaster areas, such as tornado-ravaged Joplin, MO or to libraries and schools damaged by Superstorm Sandy.
If you are unable to make a financial contribution, we would still appreciate your support in getting the word out about bookBgone.  Tell your friends, family and neighbors.  Contact us for a pickup. Give us a tip about your favorite organization that could use books.  Let us know if you'd like to hold a book drive and we'll come and pick up the books and give them a second life.

<h3>What Got This Project Started...</h3>
<p>In 2009, I moved to London to study for a Masters degree in Children's Literature. During that programme I became very inspired by the picture books I found with same-sex parents, relationships and transgender children. These books are so important to the children and families whose lives are reflected on these pages and, thankfully, the number of books being published is <i>slowly</i> growing to include even more inclusive literature for children. </p>
<p>Already knowing that I wanted to pursue a PhD programme in order to teach at the university level, I turned my research to young adult novels to see what was on offer there for teenagers (and adults!). What I found was gorgeous: stories with strong LGBT characters in engaging and beautifully written novels. What struck me most about the novels was that, in contrast to the first novels in the '70s and '80s, these characters were three-dimensional, hopeful, and often fell in love in their stories. I was hooked and knew that writing and researching this field of LGBT YA could make a big difference--not just in academia, but in libraries, schools and publishing. Thus, in tandem with my research, I have worked with publishers, consultants, librarians and authors to make this literature more accessible to readers through workshops, lectures and blog posts.</p>
<p><i>Being passionate about a subject area in the humanities, however, does not often come with funding.</i> The only option for funding my post-graduate studies has been to take out student loans. As I have watched my student debt grow, I have become dismayed with my options--until I remembered the other skills that I have. Over the years, I have kept poetry and crafts as hobbies, exploring and refining my skills in my spare time. Now, I want to use those skills to fund my primary goal: to obtain my PhD and, hopefully, become a lecturer at a university. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3>
<p><i>What I need is simple</i>: my tuition fees. The cost for my second year tuition fees is £3,900. I am asking for £4,000 so that I can cover the majority of Indiegogo's fees if I reach my goal. Even if I don't reach my full goal, all the proceeds will still go to my tuition--any little bit helps!</p>
<p><i>What I am really excited about is what you get</i>: Each perk has been designed or envisioned to somehow encompass the intersections of love, literature, and crafts. </p>
<p><i>The Perks</i>:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>£5 ($8*) - a thank you on <a href=""www.ericagillingham.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my website</a> with some hand selected love poetry</li>
<li>£15 ($24) - pin badge ""Love is Love"" - wear your love with pride! By <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/people/buttonempire"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ButtonEmpire</a>.</li>
<li>£35 ($56) - A4 poster with Peter Pan - who doesn't remember the moment when Wendy and Peter switch thimbles for kisses? Designed by <a href=""http://kalemonster.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KaleMonster</a>.</li>
<li>£50 ($79) - a rose cross stitch, created and framed by me!</li>
<li>£100 ($159) - a special reprinting of my 2007 poetry thesis, <i>In the Telling of Love Story</i>, another project close to my heart about love where you wouldn't expect it</li>
<li>£250 ($397) - modern art quilt to have in your home, made with love by me</li>
<li>£500 ($794) - modern lap quilt to snuggle up with your favourite book! Made in my home for yours.</li>
<li>£1,000 ($1,588) - a professionally bound copy of my PhD thesis, <i>Love and Romance in Young Adult Literature</i> with a personal acknowledgement, and any or all of the perks from £5-£100.</li>
</ul>
<div>*Dollar amounts given in US Dollars. Conversion rate as of 13/9/13, rounded to the nearest dollar.</div>
<p>More information, <a href=""http://www.ericagillingham.com/made-with-love-campaign/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">photos of the perks</a> and <a href=""http://www.ericagillingham.com/craft/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">examples of my work</a> can be found on my website. But first, a few teasers of the perks:</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I truly believe in community support and using the skills you have to make a difference. I am fortunate to be at a place in my research where I can already give back to those communities directly related to my research: <a href=""http://www.ericagillingham.com/academic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">organising conferences, speaking at the London Book Fair</a>, <a href=""http://www.ericagillingham.com/writer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writing blog posts and reviews</a> so that more and more individuals gain access to these books.</p>
<p>I also believe that there are more creative options to 'problems' than the obvious avenues. I could try to sell my needle work, for example, through shops or online but this campaign gives me the opportunity to do that in one intensive period without detrimentally affecting my studies. I am really excited about the perks that I have put together for you -- I hope you are, too!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not in a position to contribute financially, I still need your help getting the word out! If your energised about what I'm doing or the perks I'm offering tell your friends, your family, your colleagues. Blow up social media sites with the love on offer: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr. Work it. (And don't be shy in using the share tools on this page, too.)</p>
<p>You can find me online on <a href=""https://twitter.com/ericagillingham"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> @ericagillingham and Instagram @ericacornbread.</p>
<p>I'll see you out there--and hope to be sending you something by snail mail very soon!</p>

In 2009, I moved to London to study for a Masters degree in Children's Literature. During that programme I became very inspired by the picture books I found with same-sex parents, relationships and transgender children. These books are so important to the children and families whose lives are reflected on these pages and, thankfully, the number of books being published is slowly growing to include even more inclusive literature for children. 
Already knowing that I wanted to pursue a PhD programme in order to teach at the university level, I turned my research to young adult novels to see what was on offer there for teenagers (and adults!). What I found was gorgeous: stories with strong LGBT characters in engaging and beautifully written novels. What struck me most about the novels was that, in contrast to the first novels in the '70s and '80s, these characters were three-dimensional, hopeful, and often fell in love in their stories. I was hooked and knew that writing and researching this field of LGBT YA could make a big difference--not just in academia, but in libraries, schools and publishing. Thus, in tandem with my research, I have worked with publishers, consultants, librarians and authors to make this literature more accessible to readers through workshops, lectures and blog posts.
Being passionate about a subject area in the humanities, however, does not often come with funding. The only option for funding my post-graduate studies has been to take out student loans. As I have watched my student debt grow, I have become dismayed with my options--until I remembered the other skills that I have. Over the years, I have kept poetry and crafts as hobbies, exploring and refining my skills in my spare time. Now, I want to use those skills to fund my primary goal: to obtain my PhD and, hopefully, become a lecturer at a university. 


What I Need & What You Get

What I need is simple: my tuition fees. The cost for my second year tuition fees is £3,900. I am asking for £4,000 so that I can cover the majority of Indiegogo's fees if I reach my goal. Even if I don't reach my full goal, all the proceeds will still go to my tuition--any little bit helps!
What I am really excited about is what you get: Each perk has been designed or envisioned to somehow encompass the intersections of love, literature, and crafts. 
The Perks:


£5 ($8*) - a thank you on my website with some hand selected love poetry
£15 ($24) - pin badge ""Love is Love"" - wear your love with pride! By ButtonEmpire.
£35 ($56) - A4 poster with Peter Pan - who doesn't remember the moment when Wendy and Peter switch thimbles for kisses? Designed by KaleMonster.
£50 ($79) - a rose cross stitch, created and framed by me!
£100 ($159) - a special reprinting of my 2007 poetry thesis, In the Telling of Love Story, another project close to my heart about love where you wouldn't expect it
£250 ($397) - modern art quilt to have in your home, made with love by me
£500 ($794) - modern lap quilt to snuggle up with your favourite book! Made in my home for yours.
£1,000 ($1,588) - a professionally bound copy of my PhD thesis, Love and Romance in Young Adult Literature with a personal acknowledgement, and any or all of the perks from £5-£100.

*Dollar amounts given in US Dollars. Conversion rate as of 13/9/13, rounded to the nearest dollar.
More information, photos of the perks and examples of my work can be found on my website. But first, a few teasers of the perks:









The Impact
I truly believe in community support and using the skills you have to make a difference. I am fortunate to be at a place in my research where I can already give back to those communities directly related to my research: organising conferences, speaking at the London Book Fair, writing blog posts and reviews so that more and more individuals gain access to these books.
I also believe that there are more creative options to 'problems' than the obvious avenues. I could try to sell my needle work, for example, through shops or online but this campaign gives me the opportunity to do that in one intensive period without detrimentally affecting my studies. I am really excited about the perks that I have put together for you -- I hope you are, too!


Other Ways You Can Help
If you are not in a position to contribute financially, I still need your help getting the word out! If your energised about what I'm doing or the perks I'm offering tell your friends, your family, your colleagues. Blow up social media sites with the love on offer: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr. Work it. (And don't be shy in using the share tools on this page, too.)
You can find me online on Twitter @ericagillingham and Instagram @ericacornbread.
I'll see you out there--and hope to be sending you something by snail mail very soon!

<h3>BRIEF DESCRIPTION!</h3>
<p>My name is Lexie and this January 2014 I will be traveling to Niger and Burkina Faso, Africa with my church,for roughly two weeks. </p>
<p>This will be my first ever trip out of the country and I am so beyond excited to have the opportunity to be going to these two amazing countries. This particular trip is one i have been wanting to attend for a very long time, and my time has finally come! We will be doing all sorts of things while we are on this trip:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Spiritual Renewal Conference for Missionaries, Doctors, and translators who live in Niger all year long</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Visiting Orphanages</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Building relationship with people in the villages and towns</span></li>
<li>Helping the Compassion International Sponsorship Projects in Burkina Faso</li>
<li>Visiting hospitals with girls who are victims of child marriages</li>
<li>Spreading the love that Jesus has for all of His children</li>
</ul>
<h3>WHAT I NEED!</h3>
<p>This entire trip is going to cost me a little over $2,500. HOWEVER, i have been working incredibly hard to earn this money and manage my money so that all my funds go towards this trip, so therefore all i am asking is for help with a little less then half of it. I need to raise about $800 more then what I already have raised. All of this money would go strait towards my airfare, food, lodging and transportation within the countries once we arrive. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My church has been investing in these different communities in both Niger and Burkina Faso for many years. We have built relationships and trust with the people that we go and serve. By providing extra helping hands and the love of Christ, miraculous things happen. The reason this trip is going to impact you is the mere fact that our team is going to go across seas to not only love on the people but to educate, empower and encourage the children, elders, and locals and westerners. You would be helping me be able to build my own relationships with these amazing people and helping my educational experience grow. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul><li>Prayer is always so appreciated and vital to traveling and going to make ""disciples of the nations"". Your prayers both before the trip, during the trip and after would be the most powerful way you could help me. I need your prayers to keep our team safe, strong and bold in our faith and our love. Pray for us to radically love others. </li></ul></span></span></span></span></span></div>","BRIEF DESCRIPTION!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Four years ago my friend found out that her (then) husband had a gambling problem. When she realized that her husband had not only used all their savings and income, but also created a fearsome debt, and that her husband could not quit gambling, she decided that she would leave him. <br/> However, just before the official divorce was filed the guy committed suicide, leaving my friend behind with this debt. <br/> Because of the fact that my friend had no money to even start paying off this debt she had to agree on taking a loan with a bank. <br/> Ever since she has been forced to pay off an amount of 50,000 yen (approximately 500 US Dollars) per month.</p>
<p>She is not very well educated and because of physical conditions she cannot do work that is too heavy. Because of the fact that her day time job hardly brings in enough money to live from she cannot set aside any money to pay off the debt/loan. As a result she had no choice but to sell herself for money.<br/> Although prostitution brings in just enough money to pay for her bills, food and to pay the necessary 50,000 yen per month, it goes without saying that this situation is everything but ideal.<br/> Of course she is really ashamed of herself, she doesn’t want to be a prostitute, it compromises her health, it puts an enormous amount of stress on her current relationship and she basically has nothing to live for anymore.</p>
<p>I am afraid that, if this situation does not change, she will end up making the same decision her husband made: suicide.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that I don’t want to lose my friend and that I want to give my friend her life back without prostitution. But at the same time I have no idea how to help her. <br/> She does not want to tell anyone about her double life, because she is too ashamed of herself. That is the reason why she had not even told me, her closest friend, until recently, when my friend's boyfriend asked me for help because he was suspecting her cheating on him (while she was out with a customer).<br/><br/>Unfortunately I do not have enough financial aids to just give her the money. Lending her the money won’t help her either as her normal day time job does not provide enough slack to pay me (or anyone else for that matter) back.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The remaining debt is an amount of approximately 1,000,000 yen (about 10,000 US Dollars).<br/> I would like to help her raise this money as soon as possible, because every month that she is not capable of paying off this amount means that she has to work another month as a prostitute.    </p>
<p>With your help we can hopefully restore her dignity, her health, her relation and her life. THANK YOU SO MUCH IN ADVANCE!!!!</p>
<p>Any money raised over 1,000,000 yen will be used to create a fund for people who are going through similar problems. And in case we won't reach the goal it goes without saying that every bit of money will help my friend get out of prostitution earlier and will be used directly to pay off my friend's loan. </p>
<p><br/>Although I wish that my friend is the only person in the world having to go through an experience like this, I am afraid that there are more people in similar situations. So, in case we would raise any money in addition to the money needed in order to pay off my friend's loan, I would like to create a fund for helping people get out of harsh situations like this. That fund would then be used to help other people in similar situations to get out of prostitution and get their life back.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Tyler Alterman // Think Tank Creator</span></h3>
<p>As a child born into a bloodline of New York detectives, Tyler aspired to continue the family tradition, but as a different type of investigator: less Bogart than Boyle—a scientific detective. Though this passion became fairly doused by the ""fact-memorizing"" of high school science, he rediscovered his love once he began actually <em>doing</em> science as a student of CUNY's Macaulay Honors College. One of his hopes for The Think Tank will be to show kids and adults the type of science that isn't about memorizing lists of facts, but about the process of answering questions in fun, creative, and thoughtful ways.<br/><br/>A <a href=""http://macaulay.cuny.edu/current-students/goldsmith-scholars.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Goldsmith Scholar</a>, <a href=""http://www.jkwatson.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">JK Watson Fellow</a>, and <a href=""http://www.cafebustelo.com/es/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Café Bustello</a> imbiber, Tyler has combined his cognitive science and communications background to help raise $300K creating campaigns with <a href=""www.donorschoose.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DonorsChoose.org</a>, write a book on environmental psychology with Columbia's <a href=""http://eices.columbia.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Earth Institute for Environmental Sustainability</a>, and design public health communications <a href=""http://heblab.research.yale.edu/heblab-yale/myweb.php?hls=10061"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">under the president of Yale</a>.

Right now, there is a movement happening. It is based on the realization that the behavioral and brain sciences stand to improve lives.


As of this year, the Obama administration is considering a multi-billion dollar investment in building a map of the brain.


Cass Sunstein, co-author of Nudge (a famous book on the science of behavior-change) was given a top position at the White House.


There are a growing number of people like Dr. Pooja Agarwal, a public servant dedicated to improving classrooms and policy through cognitive science.


The Think Tank (TTT), as a lab-on-wheels and education station, will bring this movement to the public. 


The plan.
TTT will be an art+science team-up between artists and scientists from Tyler Alterman's lab. Together we will transform a recycled box truck into a fully functioning lab with a glowing pink brain on top. The result: a literal and metaphorical vehicle for empowering the public with cognitive science.
Upon hitting the streets, TTT will:


Drive to elementary and high schools where mobile researchers will teach students about the science of the mind.

Invite citizens aboard to participate in studies and teach them how cognitive science can improve their lives.

Collaborate with world-renowned psychologists and neuroscientists to deliver sidewalk talks, taking the public on their explorations into human thought and behavior.
Where will your money go? All $10,900 will go straight into buying the box truck and outfitting it.
Want more info? Check out Tyler's PDF proposal (slightly out-of date).
How will it look? Kind of like this, but bigger:

The team.

Tyler Alterman // Think Tank Creator
As a child born into a bloodline of New York detectives, Tyler aspired to continue the family tradition, but as a different type of investigator: less Bogart than Boyle—a scientific detective. Though this passion became fairly doused by the ""fact-memorizing"" of high school science, he rediscovered his love once he began actually doing science as a student of CUNY's Macaulay Honors College. One of his hopes for The Think Tank will be to show kids and adults the type of science that isn't about memorizing lists of facts, but about the process of answering questions in fun, creative, and thoughtful ways.A Goldsmith Scholar, JK Watson Fellow, and Café Bustello imbiber, Tyler has combined his cognitive science and communications background to help raise $300K creating campaigns with DonorsChoose.org, write a book on environmental psychology with Columbia's Earth Institute for Environmental Sustainability, and design public health communications under the president of Yale. Having worked in five cog sci labs, he plans to pursue his Ph.D. after a gap year spent making The Think Tank a success.
 


Dr. Daniel Casasanto // Scientist Advisor
Using methods from neuroscience, psycholinguistics, and cognitive psychology, Daniel investigates how different cultures, languages, and bodies enable cognitive diversity. He received his Ph.D. from MIT, did his post-doctoral training at Stanford, and spent three years on the Senior Scientific Staff at the Max Planck Institute in Nijmegen, NL. He is currently a professor of psychology at the New School for Social Research. Tyler works in his Experience and Cognition Lab!
 


Christine Alaimo // Art Director
In addition to her roles as a cognitive neuroscience researcher, Christine is owner of Confectionary Therapy, a cake-making business run in support of Autisim Spectrum Disorders. Having just gotten her M.A. in Special Education, Christine hopes to continue her studies in a doctorate program. She currently researches how autism influences the brain’s functional connectivity. Both Christine and Tyler are alumni of the incredible Walkabout program.

<p>As part of my senior year program I have been given the opportunity to travel to India. There were several different programs to choose from, but the one that stuck out to me the most was the hospice and palliative care program. This program will take place in Trivandrum and is aimed at exploring the development and delivery of hospice and palliative care in India, which has experienced a massive development in hospice and palliative care. I will be learning about the principles and practices and understand the needs of the dying. We will also be learning about communication skills, expand our awareness of alternative approaches to the medical model and spirituality. This program will be an immersion experience and will be very intense; we will be having 8 hr lecture days and a minimum of 8 hr home visits &amp; hospital visits during our 3 week stay in India. Based on my own personal experiences with hospice care, I see just how crucial hospice care is for the person dying and for their family. Death can be looked at so negatively and it’s a very unfamiliar topic, so it’s important for the people in hospice care to be trained to deal with the families and their unique situations. I think that by going to India, I can gain knowledge and bring back their approaches and ideas of hospice and palliative care. It is very much a growing field that we still need to develop and perfect here in the United States, and the first steps we can take are by learning from a country that does have that knowledge and experience. If we can move forward in this area, we can make the dying process a peaceful one that won’t involve so much fear and allow families to say goodbye to their loved ones in a positive way, and feel at peace with their passing.</p></span></div>","***IMPORTANT NOTE*******IMPORTANT NOTE*******IMPORTANT NOTE****

When the Chinese government closed the border to Tibet in the 1960s, the Nepali salt traders were forced to relocate their families, and the villages along the trade route met with economic hardship.

<p>Students
of the Leadership class at Palmer Junior Middle School (PJMS) are
visiting Washington, D.C., Gettysburg, and New York,  through the
Close Up program, between April 25 and May 3, 2014. No formalgroup
fundraising will be taking place for the trip, each student is
responsible for raising approximately $2,900, the price of the trip,
on their own. Close Up offers inspiring, challenging, and fun
programs for middle school students and teachers. Palmer Junior
Middle School was the first middle school in the Mat-Su Valley to
attend the Close Up program. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
qualified students from this class and organization are currently
involved in charitable, non-profit activities that benefit the school
and community. Among the many community service activities in which
they have been involved or are scheduled to be involved include
Halloween Hollow, Canned Food Drive (PJMS raised over 5,000 cans),
Special Santa, Relay for Life, Hygiene Drive, and Red Ribbon Week (an
anti-drug program within the schools). Besides these busy schedules,
many students still find time to participate in sports and  maintain
a 3.5 grade point average.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In
Washington, D.C., Close Up teachers will lead students in workshops
on civil engagement, government, tools of foreign policy, and a
global simulation. They will visit such locations as Capitol Hill,
National Archives (to see the founding documents), war memorials and
national monuments, Library of Congress and Supreme Court, visit
embassy row and, in particular, the Russian Embassy. In our extended
trip to New York, students will have the opportunity to visit such
locations as the Statue of Liberty, Times Square, and Ellis Island.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In
support of this exciting program, checks should be made payable to
Close Up. Close Up is a 501(c) nonprofit. Close Up's tax ID # is

Friends of The White City(FOTWC) is a 501(c)(3) not for profit corporation
that was founded in February of 2014. FOTWC purpose is to educate the public

Chicago and raise public awareness of the importance of preserving the
sites and artifacts related to the Exposition.</div><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">

History of The White City</h3><div style=""text-align: center;"">
The 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois was a turning point in the history of Chicago and the World.  </div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1017427/files/20141115101404-columbianlogo.jpg?1416075244"" src="""" style=""""/>
</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

“The White City” as it became known due to the choice of the white
paint used to cover many of the “Great Buildings” of the Fair, put the city of
Chicago on the main stage of the World from May 1 to October 30<sup>th</sup>
in 1893. </div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
Over 27.5 million paid admissions were counted at the end of the fair. The most conservative estimate of the number of visitors was roughly 1/3 of
the entire population of the United States at the time.  </div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
Over 200 buildings stretching across 600 acres of Jackson Park and the
Midway Plaisance housed exhibits from all across the globe. Jackson Park is located across from Lake Michigan and runs along Lake Shore Drive.</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
The fair was a starting and turning point for so many aspects of
our local, national and international histories including those of the arts,
sciences, religions, race relations, women’s rights, politics, manufacturing and
the list goes on and on.  For example:  AC and DC currents, the Ferris wheel, Cream of Wheat, Aunt Jemima syrup, and Pabst Beer.</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
All of this was happening on the south side of Chicago, Illinois and
yet many people, including Chicagoans, have never heard of the Exposition or know the lessons we can learn
from this national event.</div><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>
What We Provide</h2><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p> </p>
<h4>Educational Programming </h4>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Friends of the White City provides education by hosting lectures and tours for
schools, libraries, parks, historical societies and other public venues. In addition, FOTWC utilizes social media channels and our website to provide
educational materials that can be downloaded.  Friends of the White City is also beginning
to acquire books, souvenirs, and other artifacts to display at our lectures to
give children and adults hands-on access to the history of the fair.</p>
<h4>Free Tours</h4>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Friends of the White City developed and conducted, in cooperation with the
Jackson Park Advisory Council, free historic walking tours of “The White City”
in Jackson Park.  The tours are two
hours long and are offered every Saturday at 11:00 a.m. from May through the end of
October. The tours were successful in bringing hundreds of visitors to Jackson Park.  <br/></p>

<h4>Volunteer
Coordination

</h4>
<p>Friends of the White City  coordinates volunteers to assist other non-profit organizations who
provide educational and/or preservation services related to the sites,
artifacts, or history of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition.</p>

<h4> </h4>
<h4>Research
Assistance</h4>
<p>Many individuals and businesses can trace their own histories to the
1893 Columbian Exposition. FOTWC has received many requests from people to
assist them with discovering their own links to the Columbian Exposition.  Recently, FOTWC was mentioned by the Chicago
Genealogical Society as a way for their members to “Give Back” by providing
research assistance requests that we receive. 
</p>
<h4>Events</h4>
<p>Friends of the White City is planning educational and fundraising events
including a  “Run Like the Devil through The White City” race by the Fall of 2015</p>

</div><br/></div>","Who We Are



Friends of The White City(FOTWC) is a 501(c)(3) not for profit corporation
that was founded in February of 2014. FOTWC purpose is to educate the public
about the historic significance of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in
Chicago and raise public awareness of the importance of preserving the
sites and artifacts related to the Exposition. 

History of The White City
The 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois was a turning point in the history of Chicago and the World.  



“The White City” as it became known due to the choice of the white
paint used to cover many of the “Great Buildings” of the Fair, put the city of
Chicago on the main stage of the World from May 1 to October 30th
in 1893. 
Over 27.5 million paid admissions were counted at the end of the fair. The most conservative estimate of the number of visitors was roughly 1/3 of
the entire population of the United States at the time.  
Over 200 buildings stretching across 600 acres of Jackson Park and the
Midway Plaisance housed exhibits from all across the globe. Jackson Park is located across from Lake Michigan and runs along Lake Shore Drive.
The fair was a starting and turning point for so many aspects of
our local, national and international histories including those of the arts,
sciences, religions, race relations, women’s rights, politics, manufacturing and
the list goes on and on.  For example:  AC and DC currents, the Ferris wheel, Cream of Wheat, Aunt Jemima syrup, and Pabst Beer.
All of this was happening on the south side of Chicago, Illinois and
yet many people, including Chicagoans, have never heard of the Exposition or know the lessons we can learn
from this national event.

What We Provide
 
Educational Programming 
Friends of the White City provides education by hosting lectures and tours for
schools, libraries, parks, historical societies and other public venues. In addition, FOTWC utilizes social media channels and our website to provide
educational materials that can be downloaded.  Friends of the White City is also beginning
to acquire books, souvenirs, and other artifacts to display at our lectures to
give children and adults hands-on access to the history of the fair.
Free Tours
Friends of the White City developed and conducted, in cooperation with the
Jackson Park Advisory Council, free historic walking tours of “The White City”
in Jackson Park.  The tours are two
hours long and are offered every Saturday at 11:00 a.m. from May through the end of
October. The tours were successful in bringing hundreds of visitors to Jackson Park.  

Volunteer
Coordination


Friends of the White City  coordinates volunteers to assist other non-profit organizations who
provide educational and/or preservation services related to the sites,
artifacts, or history of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition.


 
Research
Assistance
Many individuals and businesses can trace their own histories to the
1893 Columbian Exposition. FOTWC has received many requests from people to
assist them with discovering their own links to the Columbian Exposition.  Recently, FOTWC was mentioned by the Chicago
Genealogical Society as a way for their members to “Give Back” by providing
research assistance requests that we receive.

Friends of the White City is planning educational and fundraising events
including a  “Run Like the Devil through The White City” race by the Fall of 2015

<p></p>
<p>Help Daria
into a full lotus!</p>
<p>My name is
Daria and I want to follow a Yoga teacher training. Yoga is my passion and I
have been practising it for 10 years now. And all this time Yoga has been a
very valuable addition to my life. In the past, due to the stressful nature of
my work, I had a burn out. Yoga was of great help in that
situation. It helped me learn to deal with stress, anxiety and panic attacks. </p>
<p>I want to
become a yoga teacher and share this knowledge with others. Share the way Yoga
teaches you to relax your body and mind. And the best thing is, over time you
will be able to bring this relaxation out of the practice room and into your
daily life. </p>
<p>So let me
show you how to use Yoga to achieve this. My goal is to pass on the knowledge
of Yoga and with it methods for stress relief and the prevention of stress. Stress
relief and stress prevention are the two things I want to specialise in. </p>
<p>The last
few months I was already teaching a few friends on regular basis. It was them
who came up with the idea to follow a teacher training and I must admit, I
liked it.</p>
<p>I will
start a Pre Yoga Teacher Training (January and February 2015), which I paid for
myself.</p>
<p>You can help me to fulfill this dream and contribute
to your own development as well as to the personal development of others. </p>
<p><b>Goal: 3000 Euros</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>3000 Euros
would provide me with access to a Yoga Teacher Training given by one of the
leading Yoga schools in the Netherlands and an internationally acknowledged
diploma.</p>
<p>The Yoga
teacher training will take place form March till November of 2015.</p>
<p>Your
funding is an investment, because I am offering you great benefits and hands-on
perks so you can profit directly from your funds. I am putting the Yoga teacher
training into practice and offering you everything from yoga and meditation
lessons up to customized stress relief advice. Please have a look at the list
with perks here on the right for a detailed overview.</p>
<p>In case I don't reach the full 3000 Euros, I will try
to find another Yoga teacher training, either here in the Netherlands or abroad
to make this happen with the amount funded.</p>
<p><b>With your
help</b></p>
<p>Nowadays
almost everybody is struggling with stress symptoms and anxiety. It is vital
for people to actively learn how to deal with these feelings. I am somebody who
likes to help and to share. The Yoga teacher training will coach me in
physicality, psychology, nutrition and meditation. This will give me the tools
to design a custom-made yoga program for everybody who needs it.</p>
<p>With your
funding you are investing in yourself and contributing to a more relaxed way of
life for you and others. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A Yoga
teacher training is challenging, mentally and physically. </p>
<p>I have

<p>Homelessness, poverty, hunger: All problems that could be solved easily within 10-15 years here in the U.S., and maybe another 20 for the rest of the world--though I would like to think quicker. I sincerely believe if the 'church', that is, man's representation of the body of Christ, has failed. Please understand, I'm not mad at the church, but I am mad for the church. She believe's she's doing a good job, because let's face it--if we have the power to put a man on the moon, why don't we have the power to feed the people in our own backyards? The church has become complacent, and the worst part of it all is that when any ""die hard Christian"" reads this, they get mad at me. </p>
<h3>What you are feeling is righteous anger, but not with me</h3>
<p>I think you just became aware to this as well. If we really were making an impact, there would be more ""for profit"" businesses looking out for their neighborhoods, and with your help, I'd like to become one. I came up with an idea for a card scanner and indexer for trading card games. There's hundreds, and hundreds of thousands of cards (or nearly) in each game. There's currently a need for an indexing machine. </p>
<h3>We have the technology, we can build it: together, and a dollar at a time.</h3>
<p>And as I explain below, I will use to reinvest into the neighborhoods around the card shops that lease the machines. I would also like to use some of this $10,000 towards refining an app for #Hashtaghelp. Have small ads on the screen, so that through the usage of--whether it be reading, adding, or fulfilling a need, you're generating fractions of a cent of income for the neighborhood you're part of.</p>
<h3>Just through the usage of the #HashtagHelp project</h3>
<p>That is, reporting needs of one's neighborhood, seeing if there's needs that they themselves can fulfill and/or watching the need list and being the #NeighborhoodNeed first responder--seeking out and trying to fulfill needs of the oldest requests first. (I describe that below)</p>
<p>Now, if everyone used this and their main goal was to fulfill the needs of others? Could we agree this might make a dent in Poverty?</p>
<h3>744 people. That's all I need for one #Hostchurch.</h3>
<p>A #Hostchurch consists of 744 people, each individually watching the #needlist once an hour, once a month (744 hours in a 28 day period) to watch for their neighborhood's cry for help, and being able to impact the neighborhood around them <i>instead of</i> complaining about the state of the neighborhood.</p>
<h3>Because, let's be honest, it's easier to complain than to actually do.</h3>
<p>Anyone who dismisses this idea right off the bat is a fanboy/girl for Christ.  Demons believed in Jesus too, didn't make them any more Christian than anyone else. I'm offering a possible, <strong>#needfocused</strong> solution to poverty. If you don't understand something, ask. Don't just dismiss the idea. I promise, I may have an answer to your question (I haven't been ""stumped"" yet)</p>
<h3>(I digress)</h3>
<h2>Regardless if you're a #TCGplayer,</h2>
<p>and you're just someone passing by (Christian or otherwise) you need to understand why I want to build this machine. Imagine a billion dollar market, who's sole product had no automatic way of being sorted--UPS sorts their packages (their products) and look how many they move on a daily basis. </p>
<h3>Instead, realize that it takes 30-45 seconds (dependant on internet speeds) to look up one card but people own THOUSANDS.</h3>
<p>Do you see the problem this machine fills?</p>
<h3>Ask yourself, ""what would 80% of the profits of a brand-new machine look like if reinvested in the neighborhoods around the shops that lease these machines?""</h3>
<p>That's my ultimate goal.</p>
<p>But I'm only one guy.</p>
<h3>And I need your help.</h3>
<p>I work part time for a company, 15 hours a week (if that) and have the time to work on this project. I will be the voice, connecting churches across the U.S. using #Hashtaghelp, and in those very same neighborhoods, leasing these machines to #cardshops in the area to reinvest the profits of a game people are spending money on <i>already.</i> I'm just eliminating overhead. Less overhead, more profit to spend on hiring more people, increasing more jobs, increasing the economy locally... do you see why this is a great idea?</p>
<h2>#Tcgplayer, pay attention:</h2>
<p>You know the impact on the gaming community if a machine were to be introduced to the community that worked like Redbox--networked like Redbox--where you can see the cards the stores in your area have in stock, and either reserve (and buy) them online, and pick them up in store. Let's partner up now, not later.</p>
<p>I believe the initial cost to refine this machine to be somewhere in the ballpark of $5-7,000 dollars. The other $3,000 will be invested in building an app for #Hashtaghelp (which is currently text message based, with HUGE lagtime (5-10 minutes per response). I believe I can do this better through an app for all major cell phone platforms.</p>
<p>I'd like to get paid to work for this full time--since I've already been doing it for the last 2 months for free. (60+ hours a week for the last two months. <i>Don't believe me? I'll send you notes, screenshots, etc.</i>)</p>
<h3>This is where everyone, regardless of your political, religious, or social-economic background, needs to step up and agree that homelessness is a problem.</h3>
<p>I'm proposing a solution to that, and I need your dollar to do it. Don't think it's a good idea?</p>
<p>Pray about it. It's between you and your God. And please, if your first #kneejerk reaction is no, that's because this is brand new. It hasn't existed before--what if Edison was raising money for research <i>into </i>electricity. Would you have donated to his idea?</p>
<p>Could you #SpendADollarOnHope?</p>
<h2>What do you get out of the deal?</h2>
</div><div>
<p>For everyone person that donates to this step of the project, I'm offering you .0001% of profits for 5 years per $1 you donate; and with the need that this machine fills, it will be EASILY a 100 million dollar company after everything is said and done. (If I'm renting the machine for $1,000 per location, with a goal of 1,000 locations, that's $1,000,000 a month (Worst case scenario, 50% overhead)</p>
<ul>
<li>0.0001% of $500,000 is $50 bucks a month. You get $50 a month for 5 years for giving me a dollar now.</li>
<li><i>Why should there be a second reason?</i></li>
<li>Stop reading and go give a buck</li>
<li>You're still reading,<ul><li>You're not just helping anyone, you're helping everyone, even yourself in the long run. ($1 = $50 a month/5 years, later.)</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>With all great ideas, come a few risks. (So far, a dozen people haven't found one)</h3>
<p>I've explained this plan to the most finite detail to at least a dozen people, just to make sure I wasn't insane, and even my mother agreed with it. <i>She doesn't agree with anything I do. </i>Her catch phrase? ""Does it look like I care?"" -- I had her full attention when I explained this to her.</p>
<p>(Take that for what it's worth)</p>
<p>The beginning of #Hashtaghelp relies strictly on volunteer work; if no one helps, this doesn't work. I'd like to think that there's at least 744 people who are willing to step up and listen to the needs of their nation for 1 hour a month. (I'd like to get 1,000 #DigitalChurches --groups of 744 people). As needs come in, people see it, and attempt to fill it.</p>
<h3>Someone says #Foodstuffs,</h3>
<p>we find them a food pantry.</p>
<h3>Someone says #Clothing,</h3>
<p>we find members of our individual church bodies or organizations and ask if anyone has any extra clothing we're not wearing--chances you, the person reading this has clothes they don't wear...</p>
<h3>Someone says #Shelter,</h3>
<p>we find them a shelter for the night. We find out what's wrong and we attempt to get another human being out of homelessness and into a home, with a job. </p>
<h3>Someone might need a #job</h3>
<p>this has two options: #Jobseekers and #Businesses - with #Jobseekers, people can find jobs posted (again, for free people) in their zipcode, and contact the business from there. #Businesses can post jobs in their zipcode and help the neighborhood around them. <i>We all know someone who needs a job, but we don't all know someone hiring.</i></p>
<h3>Most importantly, #safety.</h3>
<p>I believe there needs to be a system out there that someone could text #Hashtaghelp a random, but weekly rotating ""safeword"", and their address and have #911 be dispatched to that household immediately. I don't know if this <i>could</i> be a thing.</p>
<p>My mother was a survivor of domestic abuse. She couldn't ""tell"" someone she needed help, but if the technology existed then, she could have borrowed anyone's phone. You can tell anyone, anything, as long as it's over text. It puts distance between you and the situation, and the person you're talking to. It makes it not real.</p>
<p>I know, that's why I want to give those who have been or are currently being silenced by domestic abuse a voice and another way out.</p>

<p>Currently there's a need in the #TCG or #TradingCardGame Players can have upwards of 10,000 cards (I've own at least 30K+ cards). Up to this point, there’s been no way to sort these thousands of cards. Cards like, #Magic #Yugioh, #Pokemon or #WorldOfWarcraft. There's been no way to automatically sort them. I've built the Rube-Goldberg   solution, and now I'm at a point where  I need money to fund the machine. The connection to #Hashtaghelp comes from innate desire to help those around me--through this need being met in the #TCG market, comes a bunch of profit which I believe should be reinvested in the neighborhoods around those stores</p>

Year after year during the summer solstice the number of people living in the village doubled, as 600 international artists and enthusiasts set in to celebrate '<i>three days of utopia'</i>.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the Avantgarde stumbled in 2014 - the festival could not sustain itself financially again and the loss was simply too high to carry on.</p><p><br/><strong>But the spirit remained!</strong><br/><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jmccpfau/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jeanne-Marie Varain</a>, who grew up with the <i>Avantgarde Festival</i> and curated its program in 2014, and <a href=""http://logotorium.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ines and Julia</a> (MuD, Logotorium, Krarque Jamarić ) who scouted several <a href=""http://agf-spirit.com/AVANTGARDE-IS-HAPPENING/CALL-FOR-SCOUTSACTION/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Actions</a><i> </i>at the Festival in 2013 and 2014 decided to team up as <i>AGF spirit</i> and figured out a new format that supports collaboration and at the same time is able to sustain itself.<br/><br/>Instead of simply spiking prices <i>AGF spirit </i>chose a rather radical way.<br/>The collective spent 2 years ripping the festival apart in its components, developing artistic modules for smaller events (e.g. sleep – in – performance, dinner actions, punk) and experimenting with how to get things done without following old-school organisational styles (e.g. hierarchy).<br/><br/>As the gathering is being missed it's time to put all of that to the test.<br/><strong>23. - 25. June 2017 mark the date - AVANTGARDE IS HAPPENING-</strong><br/><br/>During the Happening in 2017 we will have:<br/>18 stage slots on 4 stages to be filled with inspiring music and art<br/>6 crazy Actions taking place off, behind and around the stages<br/>4 Pop-Up Actions to surprise you<br/>Live Radio Broadcasts<br/>Durational Artspaces<br/><br/>Plus, we will open up to the local community: in the past years lots of friendly souls opened their houses to host artists and guests to have a warm and cozy bed. Now we will try to connect the Happening even more than just being a weird visitor! During the weekend of the Happening the <i>Schiphorster Festtage </i>will also take place! That means an outdoor Sculpture Triennale, Football, Chess and Boules tournaments and a picnic on Sunday where both communities (of the village and the Avantgarde) can meet and throw a glance at each other.<br/><br/>As the festival takes place in a traditional farmers village in the north of Germany we feel the importance of bringing some 'strangeness and trouble' into people's lives. Chaos is beautiful!<br/>All generations from here and around the world will definitely learn from each other and open up their horizons. </p><p><br/><strong>How we deal with money:</strong><br/>We are no fans of money and understand it only as a resource and not as something that gives value to an individual. This crowdfunding will give us all the chance to share the weight of this priceless creation. After 20 years of hard work we feel the need to give you an overview of what an event like this really costs:<br/><br/>We were playing with numbers the last two years trying to find the dark hole where the money seemed to disappear because we can't do the festival again if we can't fix the hole!<br/>We calculated and calculated again, we thought of cancelling travel expenses for the artists, no food for the helping hands making food and drinks more expensive, less stages, less acts, but ... there seems to be this number which we simply can't change:<br/><strong>35.000€</strong><br/>This is what the Happening like you know it or may have heard of, the '<i>three days of utopia' </i>need to happen!<br/>Nearly 35% goes into<i> Basic Needs</i> (e.g. sound system, electricity, rents, security, telephone bills, promotion and construction material), 27% is meant to support <i><a href=""http://agf-spirit.com/A-C-T-I-O-N/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Actions</a> </i>(Music, Art, Workshops, Surprises), 8% is to host the <i><a href=""http://agf-spirit.com/S-C-O-U-T-S/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Scouts</a></i> during setup, happening and teardown, 8% is calculated for the <i>Headquarters</i> (organisation, basic maintainance) and 21% for <i>Food and Drinks</i>.<br/><br/>Maybe you feel it already...<br/>Maybe you feel that if you buy a ticket here on crowdfunding and support us to reach the amount we need ... YES! The festival will be like heaven on earth! Food and Drinks will be super-cheap and some for free, the Actions will be colourful and joyful, the magic will be in the air for three full days and most likely in your sweet memories and dreams for ever!<br/><br/>We are doing the fund-raiser with an open funding system, so if we don't reach the full amount there will be still an Action but it will have to change its form according to the amount we get to work with.<br/>For example: if we raise around 20% less than the calculated amount, prices for food and drinks will have to go up. And if we reach just 30% of 35.000 we will be able to finance the <i>Basic Needs</i>, but everything else will have to be improvised and we will have to watch together how the cookie crumbles!<br/>If we reach a lot more than expected we can give it all away for free and invite more people.<br/><br/>Our gifts to you are to become part of the <i>Avantgarde is Happening </i>in many different ways :<br/>You can buy a ticket, come and enjoy yourself and we will enjoy your company<br/>or<br/>You buy a ticket, come AND on your way home you will have a sweet memory materialized in a painting, sculpture or plant to always have something to be remembered of the great days.<br/>or<br/>You simply want to become a supporter but won't be able to join us for the Festival:<br/>we will ship little art pieces around the globe AND we have a live radio stream of the magic jam stage called <i>Annex</i> (where many great bands already found each other), so you can just go online and enjoy taking part from wherever you are!<br/><br/><br/><strong>This is an experiment.</strong><br/>The thing to count on most is <i>AGF spirit's </i>stubbornness.<br/><br/>Like in any creative process the result differs from the vision it started with. We will make collaborations happen. We will work with what we have, because we are a bunch of idealists that believe in art and world peace.

Year after year during the summer solstice the number of people living in the village doubled, as 600 international artists and enthusiasts set in to celebrate 'three days of utopia'.Unfortunately the Avantgarde stumbled in 2014 - the festival could not sustain itself financially again and the loss was simply too high to carry on.But the spirit remained!Jeanne-Marie Varain, who grew up with the Avantgarde Festival and curated its program in 2014, and Ines and Julia (MuD, Logotorium, Krarque Jamarić ) who scouted several Actions at the Festival in 2013 and 2014 decided to team up as AGF spirit and figured out a new format that supports collaboration and at the same time is able to sustain itself.Instead of simply spiking prices AGF spirit chose a rather radical way.The collective spent 2 years ripping the festival apart in its components, developing artistic modules for smaller events (e.g. sleep – in – performance, dinner actions, punk) and experimenting with how to get things done without following old-school organisational styles (e.g. hierarchy).As the gathering is being missed it's time to put all of that to the test.23. - 25. June 2017 mark the date - AVANTGARDE IS HAPPENING-During the Happening in 2017 we will have:18 stage slots on 4 stages to be filled with inspiring music and art6 crazy Actions taking place off, behind and around the stages4 Pop-Up Actions to surprise youLive Radio BroadcastsDurational ArtspacesPlus, we will open up to the local community: in the past years lots of friendly souls opened their houses to host artists and guests to have a warm and cozy bed. Now we will try to connect the Happening even more than just being a weird visitor! During the weekend of the Happening the Schiphorster Festtage will also take place! That means an outdoor Sculpture Triennale, Football, Chess and Boules tournaments and a picnic on Sunday where both communities (of the village and the Avantgarde) can meet and throw a glance at each other.As the festival takes place in a traditional farmers village in the north of Germany we feel the importance of bringing some 'strangeness and trouble' into people's lives. Chaos is beautiful!All generations from here and around the world will definitely learn from each other and open up their horizons. How we deal with money:We are no fans of money and understand it only as a resource and not as something that gives value to an individual. This crowdfunding will give us all the chance to share the weight of this priceless creation. After 20 years of hard work we feel the need to give you an overview of what an event like this really costs:We were playing with numbers the last two years trying to find the dark hole where the money seemed to disappear because we can't do the festival again if we can't fix the hole!We calculated and calculated again, we thought of cancelling travel expenses for the artists, no food for the helping hands making food and drinks more expensive, less stages, less acts, but ... there seems to be this number which we simply can't change:35.000€This is what the Happening like you know it or may have heard of, the 'three days of utopia' need to happen!Nearly 35% goes into Basic Needs (e.g. sound system, electricity, rents, security, telephone bills, promotion and construction material), 27% is meant to support Actions (Music, Art, Workshops, Surprises), 8% is to host the Scouts during setup, happening and teardown, 8% is calculated for the Headquarters (organisation, basic maintainance) and 21% for Food and Drinks.Maybe you feel it already...Maybe you feel that if you buy a ticket here on crowdfunding and support us to reach the amount we need ... YES! The festival will be like heaven on earth! Food and Drinks will be super-cheap and some for free, the Actions will be colourful and joyful, the magic will be in the air for three full days and most likely in your sweet memories and dreams for ever!We are doing the fund-raiser with an open funding system, so if we don't reach the full amount there will be still an Action but it will have to change its form according to the amount we get to work with.For example: if we raise around 20% less than the calculated amount, prices for food and drinks will have to go up. And if we reach just 30% of 35.000 we will be able to finance the Basic Needs, but everything else will have to be improvised and we will have to watch together how the cookie crumbles!If we reach a lot more than expected we can give it all away for free and invite more people.Our gifts to you are to become part of the Avantgarde is Happening in many different ways :You can buy a ticket, come and enjoy yourself and we will enjoy your companyorYou buy a ticket, come AND on your way home you will have a sweet memory materialized in a painting, sculpture or plant to always have something to be remembered of the great days.orYou simply want to become a supporter but won't be able to join us for the Festival:we will ship little art pieces around the globe AND we have a live radio stream of the magic jam stage called Annex (where many great bands already found each other), so you can just go online and enjoy taking part from wherever you are!This is an experiment.The thing to count on most is AGF spirit's stubbornness.Like in any creative process the result differs from the vision it started with. We will make collaborations happen. We will work with what we have, because we are a bunch of idealists that believe in art and world peace. We are always all in and we will find a way to include you all and every situation there is.There are many risks and challenges on our way but in our group we have the experience of decades and hearts as big as the universe! With the support of the region, the village and especially of our neighbours we feel that the closest community is already on board.So the worst thing that can happen is: us sitting at the campfire for three days straight, with our guitars and a pot of hot soup! We lived through all possible situations already and we managed them all and in the end we could always laugh about it!There will be a weekly update about the state of the Happening.Please note that we are aware of 'anything can happen' and we will just be flexible as flying rubber - flubber to come up with a solution.Other ways how you can help us:We do not only need money transfers and we are sure that there are many who would love to be part of it or supporter but can't share cash – don't worry there are million ways to help!You could share the link – everyone should do that!Spread the word – especially to your rich friends!Learn the amazing song Geld überweisen auf mein Konto by Ernsthafte Angelegenheiten and make it a viral movement!Write about us in papers, blogs and zines – Talk about us on your radio show or web stream or phone!We are sure you have many great ideas how you can get active!Thank you very much!'We will find a way to include you all' AGF spirit, collage 2016 Still not knowing what we are doing?Check out our Youtube channel where you will find all kinds of videos that will show you what the Avantgarde is Happening is about - bands that have played here that might be able to play here again if we get the moneyOr check our websites :www.agf-spirit.comwww.avantgardefestival.dehttps://www.instagram.com/agf.spirit/http://avantgardefestival.tumblr.com/  AVANTGARDE IS HAPPENING Wir sind AGF spiritAGF Spirit steht für Avantgarde Festival: das legendäre, weltweit anerkannte Zusammentreffen von experimenteller Musik und Performance, ActionArt und anderen Künsten – gegründet 1996 von Jean-Hervé Peron (faUSt), Carina Varain und Freund*innen.Jahr für Jahr feierten Menschen aus aller Welt in einem kleinen Dorf in Norddeutschland ""three days of utopia"".

Our roll induction system (RIS) consists of a pair of ailerons that will produce the roll similar to how an airplane maneuvers.The Secondary Experiment: Fragile material Protection. The team has designed a pill like structure to protect any unknown material from breaking.DATE of Competition: April 5 – 9, 2017 @ Huntsville, AlabamaThe TeamThe NSL team are 15 members in total, all aerospace engineers, and combination of seniors, juniors, and sophomores.

What We Need We would greatly appreciate any support we can get from our friends and family and community to continue on with this project. We had a successful sub-scale launch (1/2 scale), but we still need to build the full-scale rocket, payload systems and attend the competition!
Recovery system materials (parachutes, shock cords, etc.)
Recovery avionics (altimeters, GPS, etc.)
Rocket Hardware (body tubes, 3D printer filament)
Data Control System (IMUs, XBees, etc.)
Payload Systems (Servos, cabling, etc.)
Motors and Motor casing
3D printer and lab fees
Plane Tickets to Huntsville, Alabama
Hotel Costs at Huntsville, Alabama
And much more! Our total estimated expenses are about $14,000, so any help, even a few thousand will go a long way!

<h3>NOMAD</h3>
<p>NOMAD was co-founded by <a href=""http://www.sf-nomad.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Christie Seyfert and Taylor Cuffaro</a>, two people who have never been very good at the status quo. They both have dedicated their careers to changing systems to enact positive change for vulnerable communities. Christie has been a radical bad ass teacher for nearly 10 years. Her mission for herself and her students is to reach understanding through exploration, creation, excursion and play. Taylor is so sure students (and people) are happiest when they're pursuing their passions, they're willing to do all the icky administrative work to allow kids to roam the cities in which they live to discover what they love. </p>
<p>To be perfectly frank, the education system is broken. The 30:1 student teacher ratio with kids sitting at desks crammed into a single room while a teacher stands over them lecturing was created to accommodate the needs of the industrial revolution. This structure hasn't met the needs of our society in decades.</p>
<p><strong>NOMAD believes the best structure to meet the needs of our society today is project-driven education in real-world settings with real-world experts.</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>
<i>Mobility</i><strong><i> is key.</i></strong>
</h3>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>WE NEED A BUS!</h3>
<p>We need $25k to buy an old used school bus and all the furnishings to make it an awesome mobile learning center. Here's what your money gets us:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bus (duh) - $19k</li>
<li>Mobile hotspot (+ 1 year service) for ultimate connectivity - $1.5k</li>
<li>Daylight short throw projector - $1k</li>
<li>Projection screen - $200</li>
<li>Sound system - $400 </li>
<li>A saw - $250</li>
<li>4 drills - $320</li>
<li>Hardware (screws, nails, hinges and such) - $300</li>
<li>Wood for building murphy desks, cabinitry, panelling, etc - $500</li>
<li>8 chromebooks - $1,500</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The perks!</strong></p>
<p>Your funding is a donation toward innovation in education more than anything, but we do have a few fun perks for your contribution!! </p>
<p>Most of the perks get you some awesome NOMAD swag so you can sticker, patch and keep warm while showing off your support for re-imagining education. Other perks get you on our bus so you can have some fun after we've tricked it out!  You can see detailed explanations about our perks on the side bar where the perks are listed next to the donation price. </p>
<p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Over and under funding </strong></p>
<p>We're not sure how big or how little this thing may be, so we've planned for both.</p>
<p>We've signed up for flex funding to allow us to keep our funds even if we don't make our goal. If this is the case, 9% of our funds will go to Indiegogo, and an additional 5% will go toward the third party processing company. After that 14%, we'll see how much we have!</p>
<p><strong>If we make over 19k, we'll buy the bus!</strong> and just boot-strap it from there, slowly refurbishing it as we can.</p>
<p>If we make under 19k, we'll outfit our Mission Workshop (our small workshop space in the Mission District of San Francisco) with a full workshop and maker lab. Any amount of funding will allow us to begin purchasing tools, building supplies, 3D printers, laser cutters, computers etc. </p>
<p><strong>We always encourage our students to dream really big, so we've done the same. </strong></p>
<p>It's true: starting a school is crazy expensive. We've been bootstrapping and getting by as we slowly build to our full-time, multi-classroom vision. This long-term vision includes a 3-6 cohort school house with a bus(es) for each subject, 1-2 busses for humanities, 1-2 buses for STEM and 1-2 buses for arts and making. Students will start their days in 'The Depot,' a fully outfitted workshop and maker lab from which the buses depart for their school days. Students will spend one day a week in The Depot, building, making and creating. On the other days, they will be out in the city using its resources, meeting with experts and engaging with the community through experiential learning opportunities only full mobility can provide. Check out our stretch goals below to see how we'll spend any extra funds</p>
<p><b>Stretch goals</b></p>
<p><strong>$35,000</strong> This stretch goal gets us the bus and allows us to offer 3 full scholarships for the spring.</p>
<p><strong>$50,000</strong> This stretch goal gets us the bus, 3 full scholarships for the spring as well as the following to fully outfit our maker lab. Here's what we hope to buy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laser cutter - $4k</li>
<li>2x 3D printers - $5k</li>
<li>Computer lab (with Sketchup Pro, Adobe Creative Cloud, etc) - $6k</li>
</ul>
<p><b>$100,000 </b>This crazy stretch goal allow us to skip the boot-strapping and get straight to the full-time dream. Reaching or nearing $100,000 would allow us to secure a lease on a large warehouse space, outfit the space as a maker lab, and buy and outfit the bus. We are truly dreaming big on this one, but hopefully it shows you where we're going!</p>
<p>Eventually, we hope to see students out in their cities all across the country. To reach this long-term goal, we plan to provide professional development for teachers and administrators, curriculum, and support in starting Depots and NOMAD busses anywhere! But first, <strong>we need your help to prove our concept and hit the road. </strong>​</p>

<h3>Innovative education is SO important!!</h3>
<p>Our world and the way we interact with it is evolving rapidly - education should be evolving just as quickly. There are tons of amazing and innovative ideas happening in education, but most of it happens within the four walls of a classroom or school space. The innovation we see happening is long overdue in areas like Education Technology, curriculum, STEM instruction (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math), making and the arts. But very few educators are finding ways to get kids outside the classroom in engaging and authentic ways. We believe that students should learn in and from the communities they come from, with an eye toward how to impact those communities.</p>
<p><strong>How NOMAD is innovating - what we do</strong></p>
<p>NOMAD is a mobile project-based middle school. This means that we spend  no more than one day per week in our own building - which serves as our workshop and community/meeting space. <strong>Our bus is literally our classroom</strong>, which we will redesign into a high-tech space containing all the tools we need to learn and work. Our curriculum is structured around the cross-curricular exploration of a few key topics per year. On our bus we can engage in mini-lessons, discussions, research, and reflection; however, the bulk of our learning will happen once we depart the bus when we are working closely with members of our communities on issues specific to our neighborhoods and cities. In this way, students will learn how to become responsible, civically engaged, critical thinkers.  In a time when we are seeing the ""disruption"" of everything, we need our kids to be flexible problem-seekers.</p>
<p>Fundamental to our vision is a diverse student body with variation in age and ability. We know diversity of thought and experience creates the richest foundation for curiosity and exploration. Understanding the perspectives of everyone - in our classes and in the world - is our greatest tool to build empathy and problem-solve for a better tomorrow, and we have to be out in the world to make that happen.</p>
<p><strong>We truly believe we can change the way kids experience education and engage in their communities - this bus will make all the difference. Thank you for contributing!!</strong></p>

<h3>Ebola Has Disrupted the Lives of Sierra Leoneans</h3>
<p>The Ebola outbreak has unleashed an unimaginable health crisis in Sierra Leone. Not only is it turning the lives of its victims upside down, but it is  also <b>disrupting the lives of nearly 6 million Sierra Leoneans who DON’T have the disease</b>.  To prevent the spread of Ebola:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Schools and universities have all been suspended indefinitely</li>
<li>There is a ban on all public social gatherings- no cinemas, concerts, sports events, etc.</li>
<li>Banks and restaurants have shortened business hours</li>
<li>Farmers were so scared of the disease they stopped farming</li>
</ul>
<h3>Schools are Closed. Children's Education is on Hold </h3>
<ul>
<li>Thousands of children's futures are on hold</li>
<li>Children as young as 6 - who should be in school - are roaming the streets trying to scrape together a living</li>
<li>There has been <b>no school since July 2014</b>
</li>
<li>Teachers and their families have lost their salaries. Ebola has  devastated their livelihoods</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Story and Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mereweather Preparatory School was founded in 1967 with a vision that a

<h4>Education in Sierra Leone</h4>
<p>Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries in the world. Even before this crisis, the education system was under stress and was still slowly recovering from years of civil-war. <br/>A United Nation Development Program report estimated that the <b>average </b>Sierra Leonean <b>has roughly 3 years</b> of formal education.

<br/><p>Hi folks!</p>
<p>As some of
you know, this summer (August-october) I will go to south africa to undertake a
fellowship program on a consulting group called <b>Impact Amplifier. </b>This group is focused on
fostering high impact social projects in Africa in order to overcome the African inequality and poverty. (More info:
<a href=""http://www.impactamplifier.co.za)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.impactamplifier.co.za)</a></p>
<p>I have always been very interested on <b>social projects and social entrepreneurship </b>and for that reason this enterprise represents a<b> unique opportunity for me</b> both in personal and professional terms. I hope help them on the project proposed (in this exist just a draft of it so it is not public yet) supporting activities as market researching, business analysis and product development; all of this focused on the social impact that it could have. </p>

Hi folks!
As some of
you know, this summer (August-october) I will go to south africa to undertake a
fellowship program on a consulting group called Impact Amplifier. This group is focused on
fostering high impact social projects in Africa in order to overcome the African inequality and poverty. (More info:
http://www.impactamplifier.co.za)
I have always been very interested on social projects and social entrepreneurship and for that reason this enterprise represents a unique opportunity for me both in personal and professional terms. I hope help them on the project proposed (in this exist just a draft of it so it is not public yet) supporting activities as market researching, business analysis and product development; all of this focused on the social impact that it could have. 
On the other hand, despite of the big differences, I am sure that the chance of working in a country characterized by high development rates and a deep inequality as also happens in Latin America, will enable me to have a better comprehension of many social problems that affect us, and especially in Chile. Widely talking, I hope this experience enables me to acquire new insights and ideas already applied in Africa for bringing them to our context and obviously vice versa.
Lastly, but not less important, I have always been an mad traveler so this opportunity means a great chance for combining all that I love; travel, help and learn; in an amazing environment as AFRICA is. That makes this fellowship program a completely unique experience.
These are
the reasons that lead me to ask for your help my friends! Through this
campaign I hope to raise the money required to buy my flight tickets until Cape
Town, South Africa. For you are just 8€, 15€ or 25€ but for me is the opportunity of having
one of the best experiences of my life! (if you are willing to support with

For that
reason contribute and share this video!!

<p>Education has been identified to be the most important factor in
breaking the poverty cycle. However, around the world more than a 100 million
children in urban slums do not have access to early childhood education to
prepare them for school. Research has shown that these kids start school with a
significant disadvantage as they lack basic important skills, which leads to a
high dropout rate and other negative consequences. Children who receives
quality early childhood education, however, has shown to have a significant
higher completion rate in school, more inclined to stay out of crime and
substance abuse.</p>
<p>My TreeHouse provides quality early childhood education to those who
needs it most. Our school is located in the Augustino slum in Lima, Peru. My
TreeHouse is a social enterprise that conducts business that empowers and

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Your contribution makes a huge difference in this campaign. Consider the
following,</p>
<ul>
<li>In
     Lima, Peru, there is 10% of population comprising of children from 0-5
     years old - about 900,000 children. The current enrollment in early
     childhood education represents only 20% of the total enrollment in the
     education system. </li>
<li>We
     have a international management team with diverse professional backgrounds
     as well as local team with significant experience in social work and
     education</li>
<li>Our
     business works as a cooperative helping to increase the disposable income
     for the families while subsidizing the tuition for the school</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Why are we Unique</b></p>
<p>We are building a sustainable model for providing quality early
childhood education to the children who needs it the most. Our management team
has a solid diverse educational and professional background combined with a
very strong local team implementing the model.</p>
<p>Further, there are many NGOs providing education in slums but none of
these NGOs create a sustainable ecosystem for the slum communities to empower
themselves and by themselves continue providing education to their children.
Our model is built around sustainability and quality and has experienced
continuous improvement through the many presentation for academic, investor and
educational experts. We enable the slums communities to provide sustainable
quality education to their children.</p>

     have a international management team with diverse professional backgrounds
     as well as local team with significant experience in social work and
     education
Our
     business works as a cooperative helping to increase the disposable income
     for the families while subsidizing the tuition for the school

Why are we Unique
We are building a sustainable model for providing quality early
childhood education to the children who needs it the most. Our management team
has a solid diverse educational and professional background combined with a
very strong local team implementing the model.
Further, there are many NGOs providing education in slums but none of
these NGOs create a sustainable ecosystem for the slum communities to empower
themselves and by themselves continue providing education to their children.
Our model is built around sustainability and quality and has experienced
continuous improvement through the many presentation for academic, investor and
educational experts. We enable the slums communities to provide sustainable
quality education to their children.
You can read more about us and our model on www.mytreehouse.org or

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>Schools in our country are facing serious problems: Covid-19, Mental Health, Bullying, Classroom Disruptions, School Shootings. Students, parents, teachers, and school officials desperately need resources to proactively combat these ongoing issues. They must be easy to use and effective.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Children’s Hospital Declares a ‘State of Emergency’ for Youth Mental Health</strong></h3>
<p>""Right now, Colorado’s children uniquely need our help,"" Jena Hausmann, CEO Children's Hospital Colorado said. ""It has been devastating to see suicide become the leading cause of death for Colorado’s children.""  </p>
<p>Consider this: Every 7 MINUTES a child is bullied.  Adult intervention – 4%. Peer intervention – 11%. No intervention – 85%. Students who experience bullying or cyberbullying are nearly <strong>2 times</strong> more likely to attempt suicide (Hinduja &amp; Patchin, 2018) Victims - and their parents - all too often feel helpless.</p>
<div>Classroom disruption is a growing epidemic. It happens in every level, from pre-K to 12<sup>th</sup> grade. These disruptions leave each teacher vulnerable, in danger and often helpless. </div>
<div> </div>
<p>We need to protect our teachers and students from more immediate threats, including gun violence. The U.S. has had 1,316 <a href=""https://www.thetrace.org/2019/08/children-teens-gun-deaths-data/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">school shootings since 1970</a> and these numbers <strong>are increasing</strong>. 18% of school shootings have taken place since the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012.</p>
<p>Active threats include emotional outbreaks, bullying, classroom disruption, fighting, and gun violence.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Stages of an Active Threat</strong></h3>
<p>Stages of an active threat:<strong> BEFORE – DURING – AFTER, </strong>or preventative, active, analytical.  The active threat is “active” and “during” the incident. Most systems focus on the before/preventative with technology doing the heavy lifting. YOU Get it First's primary focus is during/active with the focus on simple to use technology and human interaction.</p>
<p>Current systems try to achieve an acceptable level of protection for our students, faculty, and staff.  There is a belief it can be achieved with technology.  While technology is a key part of the solution, the human factor has been ignored and forgotten. COVID has burned out our teachers with new technology including virtual learning tools and new reporting processes.  They seek a simple to use “ready” toolkit, that works.</p>
<p>The simple genius of ""see something say something"", is seeing a resurgence in the United States and this approach is being used extensively again.</p>

<p>This slogan is brilliant in its simplicity: it is direct, user-friendly, and very difficult to overthink, and produces the kind of situational awareness we need to combat the incidence of acts of violence and even bullying.  According to the Homeland Security website, the  See Something Say Something campaign “was originally implemented by the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority and is licensed to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as a nationwide campaign.”</p>

I am moving to San Marcos Texas, hopefully with a moving truck to continue my education and to surround myself with a better environment to continue my Graduate Studies at Texas State University. My soon to be wife will be attending Texas State as well to pursue her Bachelor's Degree. I am asking for a simple donation to go towards moving expenses, either for the move itself and any extra to help with rent. Total move costs are at 2000, I am asking for another 1000 to get my future wife a simple wedding band. My personal funds are running low from the costs of the wedding and Im depending on the help of you, family and friends to jump start both a career and education. </p>

With these donations, and support from Roosevelt University, we have been able to hold singer networking events, masterclasses, workshops, and special programs specifically requested by the singing community. <br/><br/>In the last two years, we have grown from an idea into a well-oiled machine, holding planning meetings twice each month. We are on track to run over 50 events in 2017, with topics ranging from audition prep, to Czech diction, to tax preparation for artists. We send out an email newsletter with audition notices for 30-70 local performing opportunities every two weeks, and are developing a public Vocal Arts Database where singers will be able to find information about every organization in the city of Chicago producing performances of opera, art song, or choral music. <br/><br/>This summer, we have taken on the monumental task of producing a workshop performance of the full opera “Little Women” by Mark Adamo.

With these donations, and support from Roosevelt University, we have been able to hold singer networking events, masterclasses, workshops, and special programs specifically requested by the singing community. In the last two years, we have grown from an idea into a well-oiled machine, holding planning meetings twice each month. We are on track to run over 50 events in 2017, with topics ranging from audition prep, to Czech diction, to tax preparation for artists. We send out an email newsletter with audition notices for 30-70 local performing opportunities every two weeks, and are developing a public Vocal Arts Database where singers will be able to find information about every organization in the city of Chicago producing performances of opera, art song, or choral music. This summer, we have taken on the monumental task of producing a workshop performance of the full opera “Little Women” by Mark Adamo. We have an incredible artistic team working with our fabulous singers to make this the best possible experience for everyone involved, as well as a great performance. The size of this project, however, demands more space than our current location can accommodate, and stretches the limits of our volunteer administrative team. Therefore, we want your support to raise $2,500 by June 16 to:1.

<p>                Since the devastating Bastrop Complex Fire, the community of Bastrop County has grown into a tight knitted family, and without our supportive community we wouldn’t have been able to make it to the Dallas Regional FIRST competition. From running concession stands during a local county rodeo to holding a booth in downtown Bastrop for local Christmas fair, we found a way to inform our community in our efforts to make Bastrop’s very first FIRST robotics team.  Attempting to not only reach the competition, but to also spread continuity throughout the Bastrop community, we held a workshop educating Bastrop Middle School students on the principles of robotics and mechanics. Also, we were able to create a budget and engineering classes for next year’s aspiring robotics students, so that our 2012-2013 robotics members can leave behind a legacy of technological advancement.</p>
<p>                Though we went in to the competition hoping to win the Rookie All-Star Award and advancing to World Championship in St. Louis, no one, not even us students in robotics, expected us to win the Dallas Regional Competition.

In our wildest dreams we never imagined that winning the competition was even an option, but it was not an option; it was our reality.  Not only were we able to take home the Regional Championship title and trophy, we also brought home the Rookie Inspirational Award, an award which celebrates outstanding success in advancing an appreciation for engineering both within their school and in their community.</p>
<p>                In less than two days after returning from Dallas Regional competition we had to come up with $5,000 solely for registration for the St. Louis World Championship, and though our school provided us with the funds for registration after that they’ve basically told us that we’d have to come up with the money for food, transportation, and living expenses by ourselves. Bastrop High School is not like the other financially advantaged schools we have been competing against. Over 70 percent of Bastrop High School’s students are on the free or reduce lunches, which is just a small reflection on how financially challenged our school is. After Dallas competition the Bastrop FRC team of 4610 literally had $800 in our bank account to provide transportation, food, and housing for 14 students and 5 mentors for a six day trip to St. Louis. Due to the expensive cost of transportation, food, and housing and the lack financial support the FRC team of 4610, homed to Bastrop, Texas, we’re graciously asking for donations, big or small, to contribute to not only our competition, but to our dream. </p></div>","In a rural town such as Bastrop, Texas robotics was an unheard of idea; an activity for technologically booming towns and technical schools.

<p><span>I was born in Germany to a German mother and a persian father. We moved to the states 22 years ago and a few years ago I landed in the tech space and joined the Founder Institute, a global accelerator program with operations in over 30 cities. I have been involved with the launch of over 300 startups and have seen how hard it is to pull it off, even in the epicenter of technology, Silicon Valley. </span></p>
<p><span>During my first trip to the Middle East eight months ago, I came to realize that there are many talented entrepreneurs in the region with great...no amazing ideas and products. </span></p>
<p><span>But there seems to be a lack of a healthy eco-system that helps support these entrepreneurs reach their full potential. There is plenty of money and yet we don't ever really hear about a company from Jordan, Lebanon or Egypt. </span></p>
<p><span>In April 2012, on my 35th birthday I decided that I was going to dedicate my life to support these entrepreneurs and the region by building a bridge between the Middle East and Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p><span>My goal is to build a bridge between the two regions.</span></p>
<p><span>Being an entrepreneur is hard anywhere, but it is even harder if you are based in the Middle East. There is a real disconnect between the community there and the rest of the world due to cultural, ethnic, political and logistical hurdles.</span></p>
<p><span><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Why we need your support?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In a region with lots of money, we are trying to prove that money does not build community... our goal is to be the spark that gets people into gear and we want to do this with the support of our community.  We are going to crowd fund this! For every $10,000 we raise we can bring 1 entrepreneur here to Silicon Valley</span></p>
<p><span>Help spread the word that we want to create a grass root effort to make this happen.</span></p>
<p><span>With your support we will be able to get these companies in front of their audience!</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If you cannot make a contribution that is alright too....instead show your support and get the word out!</span></p>

But there seems to be a lack of a healthy eco-system that helps support these entrepreneurs reach their full potential. There is plenty of money and yet we don't ever really hear about a company from Jordan, Lebanon or Egypt. 
In April 2012, on my 35th birthday I decided that I was going to dedicate my life to support these entrepreneurs and the region by building a bridge between the Middle East and Silicon Valley.
My goal is to build a bridge between the two regions.
Being an entrepreneur is hard anywhere, but it is even harder if you are based in the Middle East. There is a real disconnect between the community there and the rest of the world due to cultural, ethnic, political and logistical hurdles.
 
Why we need your support?
In a region with lots of money, we are trying to prove that money does not build community... our goal is to be the spark that gets people into gear and we want to do this with the support of our community.  We are going to crowd fund this! For every $10,000 we raise we can bring 1 entrepreneur here to Silicon Valley
Help spread the word that we want to create a grass root effort to make this happen.
With your support we will be able to get these companies in front of their audience!

We have been building a great movement.  
HipHopforChange is a unique organization that merges passions for great music and social justice.  Our grassroots outreach department provides education for the people with whom they speak surrounding issues that have been pushed to the margins.


Through these interactions, we allow the community to make donations that fund live music and art events and shape a socially conscious local hip hop scene in the Bay Area. In this way, we harness the energy of active communities to demand music that informs and uplifts. Our goal is to push back against the money that is put into the most negative music by allowing people to access local artists with powerful messages at great venues.

Background

When I visited Ghana earlier this year, I was shocked by the circumstances the poorest children have to deal with. In Agbobloshie, an area full of electronic waste imported from industrialized countries, children (some as young as 10 years old) try to make money by burning e-waste, and collecting the remaining metals of value (e.g. copper) in order to sell them to middlemen.
Here is where I met Wolfgang, a Ghanaian who is leading the Help the African Child (HAC) Foundation to improve the childrens' situation through various education programs. His work aims at developing a strong, confident youth that is characterized by active community engagement and commitment to achieve both collective and personal aspirations.

--> Your contribution will help me stay 100% motivated throughout the entire marathon - and will help Wolfgang in his efforts to support the children through education, so that they can make better informed decisions, and eventually help their own families to live a better life.

   What they get for what you are giving
Below are some example items they can afford with different levels of donation.The final choice of items will be made by HAC Foundation according to the most urgent needs at the end of this fundraising project.The allocation and usage of funds will be made public, and posted here as well as on HAC's facebook site (videos & photos).
 
10 EUR (=13 USD): 5kg of white rice (for lunch at school) 25 EUR (=33 USD): 10 soccer balls (for fun activities at school)
50 EUR (=66 USD): 1 barrell of liquid soap (hygiene is key)
100 EUR (=132 USD): food for an entire class of school children for 3-4 weeks
200 EUR (=264 USD): a teacher's salary for 1 month


The total building cost of a new school project (land, construction, first set of equipment) will be 3600 EUR (=4600 USD).  

  Challenges One of the major challenges in charitable giving is to ensure that donations really arrive where they should arrive. Having directly worked together with Wolfgang and HAC Foundation for a month, I could observe their work, and can confirm that this is a 100% trustworthy organization which is fully dedicated to the goals mentioned above. 
I also saw that Wolfgang is a trustworthy individual, perfectly suited for leading these efforts. Being born, raised, and educated in Ghana, he knows the children's problems  inside-out, and dedicates his life to help children in need.
Yet, one should be aware of the fact that HAC is a relatively small organization. While this ensures that their efforts are locally targeted, it also means that the impact is limited to this particular area, and does not cover the entire ""problem chain"" of electronic waste. However, you can be sure that you will have a direct impact on the future of these children - helping them to live a life on better education.

Other ways to help
 
Inform yourself about the problems behind electronic waste, and talk about it with friends to make them aware of the problem Make better-educated decisions with respect to utilization of electronics, old and new alike
Influence politicians to make this topic a more prominent one on the global agenda

with a Southeast Asian indigenous people known as the Bajau. The Bajau were

many are settling into villages built on stilts and stacked up coral - just
like the image seen above. Many Bajau live almost their entire life without
setting foot on dry land. I want to provide Bajau locals, of all ages, with
cameras. This will allow these people to take pictures of their daily lives, in

like the image seen above. Many Bajau live almost their entire life without
setting foot on dry land. I want to provide Bajau locals, of all ages, with
cameras. This will allow these people to take pictures of their daily lives, in
order to share their own experiences and the issues that affect them.

To work with these people once again, I will be traveling to southeastern Sulawesi, Indonesia with a conservation aimed research program called Operation Wallacea. This program will provide me with the tools and resources I need to conduct my research, but first I must pay the program's tuition and my flights.  
With your contribution you will not only help provide a voice to the beautiful Bajau People, but you will also assist me in achieving my Master's Degree.
Terima Kasih (Thank you)
P.S. All of the pictures seen on this campaign I took on my first trip to Indonesia. These are all Bajau People.


What I Need 
 


Operation Wallacea Tuition for 6 weeks: $4,950

Approximate cost of a round-trip flight from Seattle to Jakarta, Indonesia, between June and August: $1,500.
$100 to buy as many disposable cameras as I can (the disposable cameras will mostly be for the children. I have 3 small digital cameras that I can provide to adults)

I greatly appreciate your willingness to help and any amount given will be put to good use.


Money Isn't Everything
 If I do not reach my goal then your donation will go towards funding my thesis research and I will send you the perk you chose but of photos that I have taken. 

I understand that not everyone can contribute but this does not mean that you cannot help.  Please spread the word about my project through any appropriate means, including the Indiegogo share tools and social media platforms. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>AND OUR REFUGEE CAMPS CIRCUS TEAM!</h3>
Sirkhane also started classes in refugee camps, for youngsters of 
Irak and Syria. We trained 35 youngsters in stilts and other circus 
arts. Everything started in the camps, but soon enough we could invite 
them to Mardin and Sirkhane, outside the refugee camps, to learn more, 
perform around and even start earning money from their art! We taught 
them how to teach and they started animated classes for other kids 
inside the camps! By now, at least 1000 children and youngsters in 3

WHO ARE WE? SIRKHANE SOCIAL CIRCUS SCHOOL!
Sirkhane Social Circus School was born one and half year ago in Mardin, Turkey, near the syrian border. We offer circus workshops to children and youth all over the region, in schools, refugee camps and anywhere we can! We dedicate our work to bring circus to Syrian and Iraqi youth as well as Turkish local children, to teach them a joyful tool for a better future!http://artanywhere.weebly.com/



CIRCUS HEROES NUMBERS ARE GROWING!

In the past year, more 
than 150 kids benefited from our classes in Sirkhane, and more than 1000 youngsters took part in workshops all over Mardin region!Over 10.000 children watch the circus performances during Circus Festival. We animated free 
circus classes 5 days a week all year long, plus some intense
summer and winter workshops, helping many new young circus artists to 
grow!





 




MEET EYAD, AHMET, KHALID & HALE!
Hale, Khalid, Eyad & Ahmet, 4 teenagers from Syria, were displaced from their home land 2  years ago, and have attended almost every circus class in Sirkhane! They learnt stilts, juggling, hip-hop, 
acrobatics, monocycle & hula hoop. Now they started teaching other refugee
 kids and local youth of Mardin. With your help, they will continue improving their skills  and become professional circus trainers!








AND OUR REFUGEE CAMPS CIRCUS TEAM!
Sirkhane also started classes in refugee camps, for youngsters of 
Irak and Syria. We trained 35 youngsters in stilts and other circus 
arts. Everything started in the camps, but soon enough we could invite 
them to Mardin and Sirkhane, outside the refugee camps, to learn more, 
perform around and even start earning money from their art! We taught 
them how to teach and they started animated classes for other kids 
inside the camps! By now, at least 1000 children and youngsters in 3 
refugee camps have learned juggling, hula-hoop & stilts thanks to 
them! With your help, they will keep progressing  and become 
professional circus trainers and artists!


SO... WHAT DO WE NEED NOW?


Please help us to offer more circus classes to refugee kids and
future trainers! 
All our activities are free, since they are for kids and youngsters who can't afford to pay for them! That's why we need you to help us cover the circus training costs of our kids and help them grow into professional circus artists and trainers! Our training programme will improve the skills of our students and empower them to teach other kids in and around Turkey! Their professionalization will empower them to earn a living out of circus and improve the quality of their life inside and outside the refugee camps.

not free like most developed countries.  The

from malaria and Irean from what was believed to be tuberculosis.  Today the school is run by Cliff’s Nephew

evolved from three mud huts to six classrooms, a kitchen and a toilet. </p>

“Education is the only key to
meaningful freedom.  As such we need to
look at ways we can help those who cannot manage, by creating the most
affordable environment for all.  We can
only do this [education] successfully through selfless giving, dedication and

We would
like to thank all of you who took part in last year’s textbook drive as a total of 392 books were bought for the Local Cowboy Village Pre-School.  A special thank you to our previous major sponsors:
                     The Printer Doctor:            For
the new Multi-function Canon Printer                     Keynetz:                            For the refurbished Gateway laptop
computer                     Swift Delivery Systems:    For providing air freight at wholesale
cost!
With your help,  the school gained 15 textbooks in five main subjects ( mathematics, science, social studies and 
English and Zambian language), plus teacher's guides in five subjects  for
 all four grades.  Thank you all for your generous donations and you can find out who else helped out on our new Design Experts website.

L’iniziativa ha come primo scopo quello di aumentare la conoscenza sul territorio del comune di Prato degli strumenti digitali e favorire quindi l’alfabetizzazione dei cittadini.
Si punta ad arrivare ai mesi della primavera 2015 (Marzo-Aprile) ed avere almeno 3 punti in 3 zone diverse di Prato che possano fungere da “stanzoni pilota” che possano fare da mezzo per continuare a diffondere l’iniziativa.
L’iniziativa vuole essere un modo per creare partecipazione civica attorno ad un tema, l’idea di partecipare per costruire un progetto e di ritrovarsi per strade per discussione consente di unire le persone e chiedere un contributo per una causa nobile come quella della crescita della cultura digitale del nostro territorio.
L’iniziativa vuole essere anche un modo per dare valore a spazi e luoghi ad oggi non utilizzati.
ProgettoIl progetto è patrocinato da Comune di Prato, non è di proprietà di qualcuno, ma cerca la collaborazione di tutti i cittadini del comune per crescere, organizzarsi e strutturarsi. Si possono registrare dati se si possiede un luogo da mettere a disposizione nella propria strada oppure se si ritiene di poter parlare di un argomento in tema di digitale. Sono accetti tutti i luoghi dove ci si possa riunire con il vicinato per discutere a patto che siano nel comune di Prato.La community è presente anche su Facebook per discussioni aperte e per l’organizzazione in questo gruppo. Su Twitter si può seguire il progetto e citarlo con #stanzonidigitali. Questo il video di presentazione.Si cerca tramite i dati registrati di mettere in relazione “la domanda e l’offerta” e di organizzare almeno un evento nella strada per un’ora di condivisione su un tema. Il progetto è rilasciato con licenza open ""CC BY"" in modo che sia riusabile in altri comuni che vogliano replicare l'esperimento.Registrare un luogoE’ possibile registrare un luogo tramite il modulo della pagina web del progetto stesso.E’ possibile registrare: una sala, una casa una fabbrica una stanza un garage un circolo una parrocchia un qualunque altro luogo (pubblico o privato) che possa raccogliere persone per un’ora.Chi registra il luogo potrà esprimere una preferenza su un argomento di discussione che vorrebbe venisse trattato nello “stanzone”.E’ chi registra il luogo che dovrà preoccuparsi di invitare i partecipanti all’incontro di discussione.L’appuntamento nel luogo verrà definito sulla base della disponibilità del luogo stesso e dei parlatori. Il luogo verrà impiegato per un’ora (tendenzialmente dopo cena) ma potrà essere re-impiegato se gli abitanti della strada vorranno approfondire per ulteriori sessioni. Saranno gli abitanti stessi a definire assieme ai parlatori quanto ancora e come re-impiegare il luogo.Il vicinato della strada dello stanzone sarà invitato dal proprietario per un’ora nello stanzone nella data dell’evento fissato. Se invitati, potranno partecipare le persone anche del circondario, del quartiere o della zona .Registrarsi come parlatoreIl parlatore è la figura che anima e modera il dibattito nello stanzone digitale. Non è necessaria una qualifica particolare se non che il parlatore dovrà poter creare un dibattito su un argomento di natura digitale e dare indicazioni ai partecipanti su come poter imparare di più sullo strumento.Il parlatore non è un docente e non dovrà tenere un corso. L’incontro dovrà essere impostato in modo informale come una semplice discussione.

Despite the rain, the festival was a huge success bringing together the community to celebrate what we love about Petworth. The second annual Celebrate Petworth is planned for Saturday, June 6, 2015 11:00 AM-5:00 PM on the 800 block of Upshur Street NW. </p><p>The Celebrate Petworth festival celebrates creativity, diversity, culture, people, and quality of life: the core components of what make Petworth a vibrant and wonderful place to live. The festival brings residents of Petworth together, not just for the day of the event, but through the creation of new opportunities for collaboration, partnership and engagement amongst residents, businesses, and non-profit organizations. </p><p>Celebrate Petworth will be anchored around 4 main themes: Art, Music, Food and Healthy Living, and Kids/Family. This will be achieved through a design and aesthetic featuring gathering areas and interactive demonstrations and performance spaces within each theme. The areas will be designed to bring people together and engage, rather than as spectators and shoppers.</p><ul>
<li><p>The Music Zone anchoring one end of Upshur Street will serve as the main performance stage for local bands and musicians.</p></li>
<li><p>The Food and Healthy Living Zone will showcase farmer’s market produce, urban garden groups, plants for sale, gardening supplies, chef demos, wellness groups, fitness activities, and other organizations dedicated to healthy living.</p></li>
<li><p>The Arts Zone will feature local arts vendors, clothing boutiques, live muralists, performance artists, and other creative organizations displaying their products or services.</p></li>
<li><p>The Kids Zone will be a highlight to include crafts, a puppet theater, a large wall for a kids mural, and a story time area for engaging programming throughout the day.</p></li>
<li><p>A Petworth History Tent will feature storytelling by local residents highlighting experiences, landmarks, and changes throughout the decades in Petworth. </p></li>
<li><p>There will be an area for local businesses and non-profit organizations to have a presence via display of marketing materials as well as a representative to answer questions or engage the attendees.</p></li>
</ul><p><b>What We Need From You &amp; What You Will Get</b></p><p>To pull off an event like this, it costs approximately $20,000 to cover DCRA and DDOT permitting fees, required security and insurance, staging and equipment, and to support the musicians and performers. We are asking the community to help us raise $2,500, while we attempt to secure the majority through corporate sponsorships.

<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/203/334/9769fa2721cdc35d05b6063cf7309c6f_large.png?1349987963"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  <em><strong>What if _______ ?</strong></em><br/><strong>A:</strong>   That's the big question isn't it?  With high unemployment, economic fears, and concerns about natural disasters, people are searching for solutions to help them feel more safe and secure. That's not always easy in today's world, though. Many are scared and just do not know where to turn. That's why we are pushing to get the message out about being prepared for whatever comes your way.</p>
<p><strong>Q:  So what is all this talk about Preparedness?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong>  People are concerned about the status of the world and many are actually anticipating very difficult times ahead. Many people have become relentless in their search for resources and training that will help them prepare their families ready for potential difficulties – and perhaps disasters. Even with Government agencies it is commonly being referred to as ""Preparedness"" - and some in the movement call themselves, ""Preppers"".</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/203/473/3c32e019e7ac52e15892a6ce6cdee2d2_large.png?1349991244"" src="""" style=""margin: 4px; float: left;""/></div>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  <em><strong>Why is Preparedness so important?</strong></em><br/><strong>A:</strong>  No one expects to drive down the highway for the strict purpose of getting into a wreck, but we have seat belts and car insurance for the POTENTIAL that things outside of our control might just go wrong. In fact, everyone should wear a seatbelt for safety reasons – likewise, it is important that everyone prepare for other potential risks and difficulties.</p>
<p>Many people are already struggling through very difficult times. Things are tough, and people are weary.  With all the negative news, some people are extremely frightened and confused and do not know where to turn. One of the first steps in preparedness is to evaluate your situation and ask yourself simple questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you afford paying your bills or even providing for your family if you lost your job and income?</li>
<li>What if a drought or natural calamity impacted the food supply?</li>
<li>How would you survive if there was a disruption in your water source?</li>
</ul><p>Fear can be emotionally exhausting if you do not feel confident with your answers to these and other survival questions. But <strong>there is</strong> is an encouraging message out there. <strong><em>There is a way to be ready</em></strong>.</p>
<p>That’s what PREPARE Magazine equips you with: the tools, skills, and encouragement to thrive – even if things become difficult.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/203/345/048ae04cf8ccdf604340cb72b001c38a_large.png?1349988365"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><em><strong>Q:  How does PREPARE Magazine help?</strong></em><br/><strong>A:</strong>  PREPARE Magazine helps by providing advice, resources, connections, skills, and encouragement that is relevant to anyone and everyone. It doesn’t matter if you’re a college student or someone who wants to live off-grid. PREPARE Magazine shares information that is vital to your success in your preparations and readiness.<br/><br/>Another reason PREPARE Magazine is helpful is in how we present the message of Preparedness. It offers an encouraging tone with a positive, hopeful outlook on a future that is uncertain and difficult. Many people are losing hope and PREPARE Magazine is here to inject hope back in.</p>
<p>What we've become aware of is people want and need to connect with a community with resources to help in their preparation journey. They need specific resources and connections that will provide fresh ideas, skills, training, and positive encouragement to keep them on track, and not plunge them into fear. That's why we are launching this bi-monthly publication specifically for those who sense the need to prepare and want current up-to-date information.</p>
<p><strong>Q:  <em>What kind of information is in PREPARE Magazine, can you give some specifics?</em></strong><br/><strong>A:</strong>  PREPARE Magazine has covered such topics as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What to do in case of an evacuation.</li>
<li>How to survive without a grocery store.</li>
<li>Herbal remedies and alternative medical care.</li>
<li>How to build a home-made cooking stove.</li>
<li>Sanitation in “grid-down” situations.</li>
<li>And more…</li>
</ul><p>In the upcoming issues, we will expand our messages and training on more great subjects. Here are just a few of the topics that we intend to cover.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to deal with social as well as economic upheaval.</li>
<li>Guides and training on how to generate alternative energy for yourself.</li>
<li>“How to’s” on finding food, water, and shelter in catastrophic situations.</li>
<li>Living Off-grid in emergency situations.</li>
<li>Bartering, and thriving during financial difficulties.</li>
</ul><p>And much more…</p>

<p><strong>Q:  <em>So, why a print version of PREPARE Magazine?</em></strong><br/><strong>A:</strong>  First, we want to respond to the need and requests that we have received.  The actual physical magazine can be shared, highlighted, and distributed in public waiting areas and stores. The information that we share is crucial and valuable, and we want the best resource to be given its best delivery method.</p>
<p>The digital version is extremely important, and does support the global community with its almost unlimited availability; having a physical presence on a shelf or coffee table gives PREPARE Magazine an added boost of credibility that will ensure the message is taken seriously by an even wider audience.</p>
<p>Because there are costs associated with delivering a superior print version of this publication, we are asking for your support.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/204/644/c20f50f4efac158054d06ba56591e9b9_large.png?1350049563"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 4px;""/></div>
<p><strong>Q:  <em>What do I do now?</em><br/>A:</strong>  Consider a pledge to join us on something that is bold and meaningful, and become a pioneer in sharing a hopeful and encouraging message for our future. Your backing will help shape a community of people who are working together; it also propels PREPARE Magazine forward to share the message of readiness to an uncertain world.</p>
<p>We need funding for production and distribution to launch our print version, as well as funding for editors and top-notch graphic artists to make PREPARE a first-rate magazine publication. </p>
<p>Your support ensures that we get this important message released into the marketplace.</p>
<p> </p>

Q:  What if _______ ?A:   That's the big question isn't it?  With high unemployment, economic fears, and concerns about natural disasters, people are searching for solutions to help them feel more safe and secure. That's not always easy in today's world, though. Many are scared and just do not know where to turn. That's why we are pushing to get the message out about being prepared for whatever comes your way.
Q:  So what is all this talk about Preparedness?A:  People are concerned about the status of the world and many are actually anticipating very difficult times ahead. Many people have become relentless in their search for resources and training that will help them prepare their families ready for potential difficulties – and perhaps disasters. Even with Government agencies it is commonly being referred to as ""Preparedness"" - and some in the movement call themselves, ""Preppers"".

Q:  Why is Preparedness so important?A:  No one expects to drive down the highway for the strict purpose of getting into a wreck, but we have seat belts and car insurance for the POTENTIAL that things outside of our control might just go wrong. In fact, everyone should wear a seatbelt for safety reasons – likewise, it is important that everyone prepare for other potential risks and difficulties.
Many people are already struggling through very difficult times. Things are tough, and people are weary.  With all the negative news, some people are extremely frightened and confused and do not know where to turn. One of the first steps in preparedness is to evaluate your situation and ask yourself simple questions like:

How would you afford paying your bills or even providing for your family if you lost your job and income?
What if a drought or natural calamity impacted the food supply?
How would you survive if there was a disruption in your water source?
Fear can be emotionally exhausting if you do not feel confident with your answers to these and other survival questions. But there is is an encouraging message out there. There is a way to be ready.
That’s what PREPARE Magazine equips you with: the tools, skills, and encouragement to thrive – even if things become difficult.

Q:  How does PREPARE Magazine help?A:  PREPARE Magazine helps by providing advice, resources, connections, skills, and encouragement that is relevant to anyone and everyone. It doesn’t matter if you’re a college student or someone who wants to live off-grid. PREPARE Magazine shares information that is vital to your success in your preparations and readiness.Another reason PREPARE Magazine is helpful is in how we present the message of Preparedness. It offers an encouraging tone with a positive, hopeful outlook on a future that is uncertain and difficult. Many people are losing hope and PREPARE Magazine is here to inject hope back in.
What we've become aware of is people want and need to connect with a community with resources to help in their preparation journey. They need specific resources and connections that will provide fresh ideas, skills, training, and positive encouragement to keep them on track, and not plunge them into fear. That's why we are launching this bi-monthly publication specifically for those who sense the need to prepare and want current up-to-date information.
Q:  What kind of information is in PREPARE Magazine, can you give some specifics?A:  PREPARE Magazine has covered such topics as:

What to do in case of an evacuation.
How to survive without a grocery store.
Herbal remedies and alternative medical care.
How to build a home-made cooking stove.
Sanitation in “grid-down” situations.
And more…
In the upcoming issues, we will expand our messages and training on more great subjects. Here are just a few of the topics that we intend to cover.

How to deal with social as well as economic upheaval.
Guides and training on how to generate alternative energy for yourself.
“How to’s” on finding food, water, and shelter in catastrophic situations.
Living Off-grid in emergency situations.
Bartering, and thriving during financial difficulties.
And much more…

Q:  So, why a print version of PREPARE Magazine?A:  First, we want to respond to the need and requests that we have received.  The actual physical magazine can be shared, highlighted, and distributed in public waiting areas and stores. The information that we share is crucial and valuable, and we want the best resource to be given its best delivery method.
The digital version is extremely important, and does support the global community with its almost unlimited availability; having a physical presence on a shelf or coffee table gives PREPARE Magazine an added boost of credibility that will ensure the message is taken seriously by an even wider audience.
Because there are costs associated with delivering a superior print version of this publication, we are asking for your support.

Q:  What do I do now?A:  Consider a pledge to join us on something that is bold and meaningful, and become a pioneer in sharing a hopeful and encouraging message for our future. Your backing will help shape a community of people who are working together; it also propels PREPARE Magazine forward to share the message of readiness to an uncertain world.
We need funding for production and distribution to launch our print version, as well as funding for editors and top-notch graphic artists to make PREPARE a first-rate magazine publication. 
Your support ensures that we get this important message released into the marketplace.
 
 
We want to recognize and reward your participation. The following rewards are offered to make sure that your pledges are met with a heart-felt “Thank You”. Please look over them when considering your pledge:",46.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><em><strong>It only takes one candle to illuminate a nation. One idea to give us flight. One kind gesture to change a life. The good you do for me today will be the good I do for many tomorrow and just as with life, all things come full circle. -B.J.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>The Short Story:</strong></p>
<p>   What you are about to read is a small excerpt of my life. I plan to write the complete story later if I live to see it. Names have been omitted to protect identities. I'm not sure how each individual will feel after reading this but I give it to you in raw truth and sincerity.</p>
<p>                I've never really been one to ask for help because there was never anyone there to help growing up. My beginning years weren't that bad growing up in Germany from infancy until the age of ten or eleven when my parents moved my family to America. However, with that move my world changed along with my life. I remember realizing for the first time we were poor. I remember seeing a crackhead for the first time at my bus stop for school. I remember the bullet holes in the apartment sign and Rae-Rae, the first woman I've ever met under 120 lbs with eight kids under the age of nine. I remember the roach motel where my brothers and I would stand up and shake our blankets out before wrapping them around ourselves to get the roaches out and keep them out while we slept. I remember waking up and going to school, walking past the police officer in the hallway and sitting in my seat when the cute girl in front of me decided to take an interest in me. She turned in her seat, smiled, and said ""Hey"" and just as I was about to respond I remember the look that came over her face as a roach crawled out of my pocket and made its merry way down my pants leg. Needless to say, that flirtation ended as fast as it began. <br/>                 As I grew older not much changed. Things got worse and I learned to survive in my environment. By the time I was thirteen I had already been to Juvie, the highlight of year fourteen was my mother attempting to strangle me and then putting me out. I slept in ditches, the woods, and finally a condemned apartment building that had been set on fire. I would take the empty boxes from the Texaco and make a bed out of them to sleep in. I would walk into gas stations and steal Little Debbie cakes and sunflower seeds to eat during the day and at night I would go through the dumpsters at mechanic shops to find sparks plugs. I'd break them into little pieces and go around busting car windows with them looking for change or money in the cars. Eventually, after a series of events and apparent luck for a kid surviving on the street, I finally was able to buy a gun and my way out of that condemned building. By the time I was fifteen I had been in multiple shoot outs, attempts on my life, robberies, drugs (pounds not blunts), guns-a-plenty, and almost anything else you can think of that comes with that life. I had been on the run for about six months at the time and had developed a pretty serious reputation by then. At fifteen it all came to an end starting with a shoot out between some guys who I wouldn't say were friends but more like associates. They tried to double cross me and what I assumed at that time was kill me as well because they drew their weapons first, so in my mind...let's shoot it out.</p>
<p>                These events finally got the police a little closer to catching up to me and eventually they finally did and I was arrested and taken in. I was charged as an adult in one county and as a juvenile in the others. I was fifteen years old. I was placed in juvenile for about three or four days and then sent to an adult jail. For the next two years I was back and forth from one court to another for one charge or another. Most got dropped due to lack of evidence or just completely false charges and others got dropped because the juvenile courts recognized that my adult charges were going to get me more time than  they would imagine imposing. My adult charges started out with an offer of life plus twenty years.  Then down to twenty or twenty five years and finally on the day of the trial I took a plea for ten years. I spent the next six years of my life in the five worst prisons in Georgia. Six years of level five maximum security prisons and two years of medium security before I was released. Six years of watching people get raped, stabbed, hit with locks, suicide attempts, and pure insanity and two years of thinking these guys would never make it. I never thought I would actually make it. But I did. I was taught by convicts. Those who had been around and survived the Wayne Gardner terror. Those who showed me it's not about being tough. It's about respect. About being a man and standing up for yourself and your actions. How to do time like a vet. Fast forward through the years and the many experiences and teachers I had along the way and these guys played a part in helping me become who I am today. They along with the environment, helped me to look within and discover myself. To recreate myself. To strengthen myself. To survive a prison system that is solely built to kill and destroy. For a good eight years my environment was so violent and chaotic I did my time as if I had a life sentence. I put the thought of ever being free out of my mind right along with hope. I just did time. No one can save you. You have to save yourself. I told myself this is home now and comforted myself with the thought that if it ever gets to be too much I can always try to escape again or kill myself. I guess it was my way of saying if push comes to shove I'll decide when this sentence is over. Until then I would ride until the wheels fell off. But, like Inception, I planted a seed in the back of my mind as a way to save myself in a way I guess. That seed was a reminder that all my problems are temporary. Some may last longer than others, but still temporary. As I grew older I started doing something just for self-improvement. It started around the time I was nineteen or twenty. Each year on my birthday I would take one thing about myself and change it. Just whatever I felt at the time was a negative trait or weakness that needed to be corrected or strengthened. With each change I noticed a difference and others noticed it as well, so I continued doing it just because but little did I know I was beginning the journey to my higher self.</p>
<p>                By this time in my bid, about six or seven years in, I really didn't worry about much at a new camp because everywhere I went someone knew me. As I said earlier, there were only five close security camps so all of us just rotated from one close security to the next. Sure enough I got to the dorm and it's a lot of guys I've done time with at different camps so they are giving me the rundown of this camp. About two or three days in I still hadn't got my eyeglasses back, and in prison it's kind of helpful to be able to see what the hell is going on around you, so I was trying to find someone I could talk to for some help with the issue when a Sgt. walked into the dorm to inspect the showers. They were pretty rundown and I overheard him discussing with another inmate who owned a tile business before murdering someone (in self-defense as he would say a million times) that the warden wanted to install new tile in all of the showers in the prison. So I stood closer and listened because for some reason I was intrigued about learning to lay tile. I was never given an opportunity in all the other prisons to learn a trade or skill so when I heard the Sgt. say he would need a crew I volunteered on the spot. I told him exactly what I just stated above. ""I've been locked up since I was fifteen years old and I've never been given a chance to learn any trade or skill and this sounds interesting."" Luckily he knew nothing about my record at the time so he judged me based on my presentation and what his gut told him. This had to be what I think was the big turning point for me and a huge leap in my growth and development. The reason my file was so bad and why I stayed in so much trouble was because I was sent to all these crazy camps and would get targeted by the cert team and c.o.'s the moment I got somewhere. I was never given a chance to be good and I'm not the turn the other cheek kind of guy. But this guy, the Sgt., was just cool. He gave me a chance. Even after he viewed my file and all the red flags and security comments and stuff, he still gave me a chance and was just like, ""he'll be my responsibility if he messes up"". He saw something more in me and gave me the opportunity to see it as well.</p>
<p>                My work ethic and behavior was gaining me favor on both sides and the Sgt. had taken a liking to me and was putting in good words on my behalf to the warden as well as other higher ups which was helping change the image of that file. I was there for about a year I guess. The detail was over but the privileges still remained and that help along with a lady who started a program for guys like myself who had been locked up since the ages of fourteen and fifteen in adult jails and prisons, eventually got my security dropped and for the first time in in all my years I was sent to what was kind of like a work camp/transitional center. I wouldn't be able to go outside the gates but it still was a chance to get out of the close/maximum security Ferris wheel I had been on for so long. A better shot at actually making it out. I would love to say it was the best thing ever but it wasn't. The guys at this place had no respect. They had really short sentences and didn't really care about anything. Acted way harder than they actually were and I think that really bothered me. It was like, ""why is everyone trying to act so tough and hard and none of you have any time. None of you know what it's like to be in the craziness I just came from."" And this went extra for some of the guards there. I met some really cool guys there though. Got to hear about how the world was out there. I actually got to see cars driving down the road outside of the fence. And not patrol/perimeter cars but actual free people cars. That was amazing. I was blown away. To see like regular trees change colors with the season. To watch a DVD. To see a salt and pepper shaker. Just mind boggling. I couldn't get over the cars though. Every rec call I would just go stand by the gate and wait for a car to drive by. There were a couple of houses down the street I could see and I would just stare at them and the cars going by. Man that had to be one of the best feelings in the world. I just saw a car. Awesome.</p>
<p>     I ended up at my last and final camp. Medium security. About a year and a half left on my sentence. A vet to this chain gang shit. No worries. I know prison. It's all I've known so it was easy to slide right back into doing time. I was more calm at this point. I could see some daylight now. Thoughts of getting out were more frequent. Thinking about what I'm going to do when I get out. This place had classes you could join and more of an environment where you could sit down at a table and read a book without worrying about somebody dropping a buffer off the top rail onto your head. There were fights here and there but nobody was trying to really kill or mess someone up here. These guys weren't thinking about what you do with baby oil and magic shave. Nowhere near that level. So that's what I would do. I would go to these classes. I would go to the library and read old school books that had been donated. My eldest brother had been trying to encourage me for years to do these things. To focus on education and change but my environment was too real for it at the time. I needed to focus more on surviving and doing time then. But he would still send me books. Send me pictures of his travels. Show me a brighter side and another way of life. I guess I was at a point where I could listen to him then. So I started asking for math books and he would send them to me. I would check out the GED book from the library and every morning I would sit down at a table and just do math problems. My reading skills were always excellent. Science, social studies, writing, no problem. But math, that was an issue. So I would do problems. I would use the books my brother sent me and do problems from them as well. I started really focusing on my education and my brother supported me tremendously in that direction. We would talk and I would share ideas and he would make corrections or additions. It started to get to a point where my mind was so much into the free world that prison became the background. I would look around me and think to myself I have twenty four hours a day to just study with no distractions and that's what I'm going to do. The regular prison stuff would go on but it was so beneath me and easy to me now that it didn't get in the way. I would just think to myself, ""I've been as far down this path as you can go. I've seen it all and done it all. And by different standards I've excelled everywhere I went on this path. I'm going to do the same thing just in the opposite direction now."" My thoughts became bigger. My goals and dreams became bigger. And any negative feedback or opposition just made them stronger and larger. When someone would say it isn't as easy as I think, in my mind, I would be like, ""YES!!!!, with all the people saying this, it just means less competition for me. Doing this time was fucking hard. Doing what you don't have the balls to do is going to be easy."" I was in my own world. I was building my future in my mind and making preparations for it and I was damn serious about it.</p>
<p>                I started telling myself slowly but surely I'm going to begin taking this chain-gang 'armor' off and donning free world 'clothes'. I started to recreate myself. I would think of how a normal person acts, walks, speaks, etc... and began emulating that. I remember my brother and I talking once and he asked if I would like to have a party or something when I get out or if I just wanted to hit the ground running like I always said and I told him I want my feet like the Flintstones. Running before they even touch the ground. As I was getting closer to getting out I kept waiting to see if I would feel that fear of getting out. Personally I think that it is way overrated. I didn't feel it anyway. Normally they lock you down a day before you are to be released for safety but if your release date is on a Monday you get locked down that Friday, which was the case with me. It sucked but I was like fuck it. So they put me in the hole and because prisons are so crowded now, the hole was now a two man room. Just a few months before my release the regular population dorms were turned into three-man rooms. Just my luck they put me in a cell with a guy who was an ex-marine instructor who, in front of a crowd, snapped a guys neck outside of a restaurant in self-defense because the guy tried to rob him. He was arrested of course and during his hearing was found not guilty on account of witnesses who saw the deceased pull the gun. The deceased’s family member, brother or cousin or something, stands up and is ranting about payback. After the hearing the ex-marine instructor goes home and weld's two clips together and goes to the deceased families house and kills everyone inside. Once in prison he kills or almost kills two other guys as well and beat some c.o.'s along the way. They got him back pretty good though. Had to have reconstructive surgery on the roof of his mouth. But this is my cellmate for the next three days. A lunatic who can actually walk the walk. Fortunately we had crossed paths before in the SMU unit at the beginning of my bid. He was a pretty cool guy. We laughed and talked about old times and crazy stuff. Girls he was talking to at the time.  How to reset your diaphragm if someone hits you in the stomach so you can recover and prepare for attack. You know, just the normal things. The three days went by as normal except they wouldn't let me shower. Monday rolled around and I was released. Oct. 28th, 2009. I didn't cry. I didn't feel some overwhelming sense of joy. Hell I felt more emotion seeing those cars than I did being released. I guess I just felt like,  well it's about time. My mom, dad, and eldest brother were there waiting on me. We hugged and I guess they were looking at me kind of strange. Not sure of what they were thinking but we drove off to a gas station to get some gas. I bought my first pack of sunflower seeds (bar-b-q) in years and some juice and we headed to Denny's or Ihop for breakfast. If anything I didn't really feel anything. Still kind of bland. I was smiling and happy to be out but it wasn't like the stories you hear of people getting out and kissing the ground. We finished breakfast and because they came in separate cars, I said bye to my father and that I would see him later and I hopped in the car with my brother and we headed straight for the community college near where I would be living so I could get enrolled for the spring semester.</p>
<p>    We pulled up, spoke with a counselor to explain the situation, and just like planned within three and half to five hours of being released from ten years in prison, I was enrolled and officially a college student majoring in Industrial and Systems Engineering. I was sentenced under the first offenders act so as we left the campus we began to discuss how to get my record sealed, I needed i.d. and a drivers license, some clothes, a book bag, laptop, and a job. My brother provided the book bag, clothes, support in getting my record officially sealed and laptop. Within two weeks I had acquired everything else. For the plans I had created for my future inside, I hadn't even started warming up yet. I finished my first semester with a 3.5 gpa. In those months I was homeless, sick, working two jobs, sleeping out of my car and any place my brother could get me (he lived out of state but came down for my release). I was hurting pretty bad. I got on food stamps, went to recruiters for the Army, Navy, and Marines and was turned down at each. Finally after things got so bad that I ended up in the emergency room from an infection from the shack I was living in my brother pulled through and saved me again. After the semester was over, he got some of his friends to take me in until he could come down and get me. I sold my car on craigslist the day before he came down and the next day I was in a new state with yet again a new beginning. I enrolled in college here, got a full-time good job, rented a townhouse with two roommates and have been sticking to the script. Now everything I've been working hard for and the momentum I've built could come to a real slow pace, almost to a halt. After working for two years, I made the decision to resign from my job to go to school full-time to finish up my degree. The engineering classes require too much time to work a full-time job and excel in my academics as well as deal with the mental struggle I deal with daily from my past and all I've been through. My end goal is to write a book about my life and ultimately my success despite it all. What I've written thus far is a very condensed excerpt to lend insight into the depth I'm climbing from and I feel I haven't achieved a point where I can give a happy ending to my story. If I were to die today I think a happy ending this would not make but to have a Masters Degree and then Ph.D. and to be able to inspire and help others coming out to reach for something nobler and to possibly prevent some kid from going in. That sounds better but still is only a beginning. <br/>                 What I'm asking for is support to make that happy ending come true for the story that is my life. I need and want to be able to focus solely on school and Engineering. I need a foundation that will allow me to not have to worry about how am I going to pay my rent, car note, insurance, tuition, books, food, gas, etc. as well as understand differential equations and linear algebra when the last grade I completed was the eighth. I understand that sometimes a person needs to struggle a bit to build character but I don't think there is a word for what I've been through already. I just want the opportunity that the Sgt. gave me in Telfair. This time I'm asking, not taking. I'm smart enough to realize I've done almost all I can do on my own. Now I need some help to make it the rest of the way.</p>

It only takes one candle to illuminate a nation. One idea to give us flight. One kind gesture to change a life. The good you do for me today will be the good I do for many tomorrow and just as with life, all things come full circle. -B.J.
The Short Story:
   What you are about to read is a small excerpt of my life. I plan to write the complete story later if I live to see it. Names have been omitted to protect identities. I'm not sure how each individual will feel after reading this but I give it to you in raw truth and sincerity.
                I've never really been one to ask for help because there was never anyone there to help growing up. My beginning years weren't that bad growing up in Germany from infancy until the age of ten or eleven when my parents moved my family to America. However, with that move my world changed along with my life. I remember realizing for the first time we were poor. I remember seeing a crackhead for the first time at my bus stop for school. I remember the bullet holes in the apartment sign and Rae-Rae, the first woman I've ever met under 120 lbs with eight kids under the age of nine. I remember the roach motel where my brothers and I would stand up and shake our blankets out before wrapping them around ourselves to get the roaches out and keep them out while we slept. I remember waking up and going to school, walking past the police officer in the hallway and sitting in my seat when the cute girl in front of me decided to take an interest in me. She turned in her seat, smiled, and said ""Hey"" and just as I was about to respond I remember the look that came over her face as a roach crawled out of my pocket and made its merry way down my pants leg. Needless to say, that flirtation ended as fast as it began.                  As I grew older not much changed. Things got worse and I learned to survive in my environment. By the time I was thirteen I had already been to Juvie, the highlight of year fourteen was my mother attempting to strangle me and then putting me out. I slept in ditches, the woods, and finally a condemned apartment building that had been set on fire. I would take the empty boxes from the Texaco and make a bed out of them to sleep in. I would walk into gas stations and steal Little Debbie cakes and sunflower seeds to eat during the day and at night I would go through the dumpsters at mechanic shops to find sparks plugs. I'd break them into little pieces and go around busting car windows with them looking for change or money in the cars. Eventually, after a series of events and apparent luck for a kid surviving on the street, I finally was able to buy a gun and my way out of that condemned building. By the time I was fifteen I had been in multiple shoot outs, attempts on my life, robberies, drugs (pounds not blunts), guns-a-plenty, and almost anything else you can think of that comes with that life. I had been on the run for about six months at the time and had developed a pretty serious reputation by then. At fifteen it all came to an end starting with a shoot out between some guys who I wouldn't say were friends but more like associates. They tried to double cross me and what I assumed at that time was kill me as well because they drew their weapons first, so in my mind...let's shoot it out.
                These events finally got the police a little closer to catching up to me and eventually they finally did and I was arrested and taken in. I was charged as an adult in one county and as a juvenile in the others. I was fifteen years old. I was placed in juvenile for about three or four days and then sent to an adult jail. For the next two years I was back and forth from one court to another for one charge or another. Most got dropped due to lack of evidence or just completely false charges and others got dropped because the juvenile courts recognized that my adult charges were going to get me more time than  they would imagine imposing. My adult charges started out with an offer of life plus twenty years.  Then down to twenty or twenty five years and finally on the day of the trial I took a plea for ten years. I spent the next six years of my life in the five worst prisons in Georgia. Six years of level five maximum security prisons and two years of medium security before I was released. Six years of watching people get raped, stabbed, hit with locks, suicide attempts, and pure insanity and two years of thinking these guys would never make it. I never thought I would actually make it. But I did. I was taught by convicts. Those who had been around and survived the Wayne Gardner terror. Those who showed me it's not about being tough. It's about respect. About being a man and standing up for yourself and your actions. How to do time like a vet. Fast forward through the years and the many experiences and teachers I had along the way and these guys played a part in helping me become who I am today. They along with the environment, helped me to look within and discover myself. To recreate myself. To strengthen myself. To survive a prison system that is solely built to kill and destroy. For a good eight years my environment was so violent and chaotic I did my time as if I had a life sentence. I put the thought of ever being free out of my mind right along with hope. I just did time. No one can save you. You have to save yourself. I told myself this is home now and comforted myself with the thought that if it ever gets to be too much I can always try to escape again or kill myself. I guess it was my way of saying if push comes to shove I'll decide when this sentence is over. Until then I would ride until the wheels fell off. But, like Inception, I planted a seed in the back of my mind as a way to save myself in a way I guess. That seed was a reminder that all my problems are temporary. Some may last longer than others, but still temporary. As I grew older I started doing something just for self-improvement. It started around the time I was nineteen or twenty. Each year on my birthday I would take one thing about myself and change it. Just whatever I felt at the time was a negative trait or weakness that needed to be corrected or strengthened. With each change I noticed a difference and others noticed it as well, so I continued doing it just because but little did I know I was beginning the journey to my higher self.
                By this time in my bid, about six or seven years in, I really didn't worry about much at a new camp because everywhere I went someone knew me. As I said earlier, there were only five close security camps so all of us just rotated from one close security to the next. Sure enough I got to the dorm and it's a lot of guys I've done time with at different camps so they are giving me the rundown of this camp. About two or three days in I still hadn't got my eyeglasses back, and in prison it's kind of helpful to be able to see what the hell is going on around you, so I was trying to find someone I could talk to for some help with the issue when a Sgt. walked into the dorm to inspect the showers. They were pretty rundown and I overheard him discussing with another inmate who owned a tile business before murdering someone (in self-defense as he would say a million times) that the warden wanted to install new tile in all of the showers in the prison. So I stood closer and listened because for some reason I was intrigued about learning to lay tile. I was never given an opportunity in all the other prisons to learn a trade or skill so when I heard the Sgt. say he would need a crew I volunteered on the spot. I told him exactly what I just stated above. ""I've been locked up since I was fifteen years old and I've never been given a chance to learn any trade or skill and this sounds interesting."" Luckily he knew nothing about my record at the time so he judged me based on my presentation and what his gut told him. This had to be what I think was the big turning point for me and a huge leap in my growth and development. The reason my file was so bad and why I stayed in so much trouble was because I was sent to all these crazy camps and would get targeted by the cert team and c.o.'s the moment I got somewhere. I was never given a chance to be good and I'm not the turn the other cheek kind of guy. But this guy, the Sgt., was just cool. He gave me a chance. Even after he viewed my file and all the red flags and security comments and stuff, he still gave me a chance and was just like, ""he'll be my responsibility if he messes up"". He saw something more in me and gave me the opportunity to see it as well.
                My work ethic and behavior was gaining me favor on both sides and the Sgt. had taken a liking to me and was putting in good words on my behalf to the warden as well as other higher ups which was helping change the image of that file. I was there for about a year I guess. The detail was over but the privileges still remained and that help along with a lady who started a program for guys like myself who had been locked up since the ages of fourteen and fifteen in adult jails and prisons, eventually got my security dropped and for the first time in in all my years I was sent to what was kind of like a work camp/transitional center. I wouldn't be able to go outside the gates but it still was a chance to get out of the close/maximum security Ferris wheel I had been on for so long. A better shot at actually making it out. I would love to say it was the best thing ever but it wasn't. The guys at this place had no respect. They had really short sentences and didn't really care about anything. Acted way harder than they actually were and I think that really bothered me. It was like, ""why is everyone trying to act so tough and hard and none of you have any time. None of you know what it's like to be in the craziness I just came from."" And this went extra for some of the guards there. I met some really cool guys there though. Got to hear about how the world was out there. I actually got to see cars driving down the road outside of the fence. And not patrol/perimeter cars but actual free people cars. That was amazing. I was blown away. To see like regular trees change colors with the season. To watch a DVD. To see a salt and pepper shaker. Just mind boggling. I couldn't get over the cars though. Every rec call I would just go stand by the gate and wait for a car to drive by. There were a couple of houses down the street I could see and I would just stare at them and the cars going by. Man that had to be one of the best feelings in the world. I just saw a car. Awesome.
     I ended up at my last and final camp. Medium security. About a year and a half left on my sentence. A vet to this chain gang shit. No worries. I know prison. It's all I've known so it was easy to slide right back into doing time. I was more calm at this point. I could see some daylight now. Thoughts of getting out were more frequent. Thinking about what I'm going to do when I get out. This place had classes you could join and more of an environment where you could sit down at a table and read a book without worrying about somebody dropping a buffer off the top rail onto your head. There were fights here and there but nobody was trying to really kill or mess someone up here. These guys weren't thinking about what you do with baby oil and magic shave. Nowhere near that level. So that's what I would do. I would go to these classes. I would go to the library and read old school books that had been donated. My eldest brother had been trying to encourage me for years to do these things. To focus on education and change but my environment was too real for it at the time. I needed to focus more on surviving and doing time then. But he would still send me books. Send me pictures of his travels. Show me a brighter side and another way of life. I guess I was at a point where I could listen to him then. So I started asking for math books and he would send them to me. I would check out the GED book from the library and every morning I would sit down at a table and just do math problems. My reading skills were always excellent. Science, social studies, writing, no problem. But math, that was an issue. So I would do problems. I would use the books my brother sent me and do problems from them as well. I started really focusing on my education and my brother supported me tremendously in that direction. We would talk and I would share ideas and he would make corrections or additions. It started to get to a point where my mind was so much into the free world that prison became the background. I would look around me and think to myself I have twenty four hours a day to just study with no distractions and that's what I'm going to do. The regular prison stuff would go on but it was so beneath me and easy to me now that it didn't get in the way. I would just think to myself, ""I've been as far down this path as you can go. I've seen it all and done it all. And by different standards I've excelled everywhere I went on this path. I'm going to do the same thing just in the opposite direction now."" My thoughts became bigger. My goals and dreams became bigger. And any negative feedback or opposition just made them stronger and larger. When someone would say it isn't as easy as I think, in my mind, I would be like, ""YES!!!!, with all the people saying this, it just means less competition for me. Doing this time was fucking hard. Doing what you don't have the balls to do is going to be easy."" I was in my own world. I was building my future in my mind and making preparations for it and I was damn serious about it.
                I started telling myself slowly but surely I'm going to begin taking this chain-gang 'armor' off and donning free world 'clothes'. I started to recreate myself. I would think of how a normal person acts, walks, speaks, etc... and began emulating that. I remember my brother and I talking once and he asked if I would like to have a party or something when I get out or if I just wanted to hit the ground running like I always said and I told him I want my feet like the Flintstones.

Below is exactly what the funds will be spent on. Anything extra will be put towards gettting therapy and funding the rest of my degree as what is presented thus far only covers up to one year. I will also be applying for any grants and scholarships as I go and if need be, all the loans I can get. I feel my education will be worth the debt.

I grew up in a small town where the K-8 schoolhouse not only taught us the 3 R's but also stressed the importance of compassion, the strength of community and most importantly how learning can be fun. </p><p>I learned Spanish because, quite frankly, I fell in love. My boyfriend had recently moved to the United States and knew little English. I was so often frustrated with not being able to communicate complex thoughts that I took it upon myself to learn Spanish as he learned English. I had been taught as a child to be motivated by the challenge to learn a new skill set and this was just my next big obstacle to conquer. As out relationship grew, so did my love for the Spanish language and the cultures of people across the globe who communicate in Spanish. Speaking Spanish has enriched my life in ways I never thought possible. I married the man I learned a new language for and we continue to grow and learn together in a magnificent combination of our two cultures and our two languages. It is my desire to transfer my love of learning onto the next generation of brilliant minds, no matter what language they might speak at first. </p><p>When I was first interested in becoming a teacher I took and Intro to Teaching class at Cabrillo College. I was excited to be placed in a class room of migrant students so I could use my Spanish skills. As I started my journey to become a teacher I was shocked to find out that these 6th-8th grade students seemed to have no knowledge that school could be fun and rewarding. The students in this classroom were English Language Learners and I quickly realized that for the growing number of students who are trying to learn not only the required course materials, but a new language and a new culture, while at the same time trying to figure out who they are, being in a classroom setting is very rarely fun. It is usually a constant reminder of being different and especially in a middle school setting, different is not always a good thing. In my experience, these students felt marginalized by their English only speaking peers for many reasons, one of these being that the equity of their learning experience was drastically lacking the tools needed to support them.This was not the downfall of the teacher of the class, because she was amazing at using the materials she was given to make the most out of every situation. These students are just as capable to learn as anyone else, but face more challenges than their English only speaking peers in the form of cultural and linguistic isolation that can prohibit the growth of self confidence and an awareness of their ability to learn. These students will soon be the people looking for entry level jobs in a variety of different employment sectors and if they do not reach their fullest potential in the classroom they will be the greatest wasted resource of the nation.</p><p> My goal in becoming a bilingual teacher is to try and bring some of the fun back into learning for these students. I want to help them bridge the gap between cultures and to help them appreciate their situations as blossoming young people in this society that is becoming more and more multilingual and multicultural. I want to help them build confidence in themselves as they come to understand that it is better to know two languages than just one and that knowing either language does not limit their ability to expand their minds and become a highly intelligent and productive member of society. The language that a child speaks should not limit their access to a decent education. The more languages in which a student can fully comprehend material, the more complete their knowledge on a subject will be and the better equipped they are to share that knowledge with others. I know that I have the patience, compassion and skill set to make this happen. At the end of my first year as a student teacher I realized I had broken though to students who at the beginning of the year were quiet and shy. I saw the beautiful transformation in these students as they gained confidence and with that confidence gained the motivation to succeed. I was privileged to sit with the teachers at the 8th grade graduation ceremony. There was one student in particular who I was especially proud to watch walk across the stage that day. He was one of the most brilliant people in the class, he just didn't care and even worse, thought it was cool that he didn't care. I worked all that out of him though, and over time he realized it was actually less effort for him to just do the work than to sit and argue with me about not doing the work. After the graduation his mother came up to me and thanked me. We hugged and fought back tears as she explained to me that with his 8th grade diploma, he was now the highest educated person in his family. At that moment I knew in my heart that all the battles and all the struggles had been worth it. I also knew that this is what I wanted to do with my life, I wanted to make students care about them selves and their futures. </p><p>I applied at the University of Santa Cruz for their Masters in Education program. It is a super intensive 5 quarter program and at the end I will not only have my Masters Degree, but also a teacher credential with a Spanish language authorization. I just found out last week that I was accepted! Wooooo Whooooooo! That was the easy part! The hard part, paying for the $25,000 tuition along with all my regular bills for the next year and a half!! I am asking you all to help me get going with this so I can concentrate on my studies and not my job. I currently work full time as a restaurant manager and while I love my job, I feel strongly that I can contribute more to the greater good of society by becoming a teacher. I am pretty much uprooting the life I have come to love on the chance of making it better, not just for me, but for the hundreds, maybe even thousands of students I hope to teach. I made the opportunity happen, so now I am putting it all on the line to take the chance and see if I can make the money to make my dreams happen! I love watching the magic of people learning new skills, and now that I am committed to making it happen in a classroom instead of the kitchen, I have to give up the regular pay check for the time being. I will still have to work in some regard to make ends meet, but it will be a lot easier to keep calm and focused on becoming the best teacher I can be if I know I have the monetary aspect of life situated in a manageable fashion. This money will allow me to stress about theories, projects and tests instead of paying the water bill, worrying where my next meal is coming from and how I am going to afford books! </p><p>The impact this will have on my life and the lives of all my future students is immense. As my dream of becoming a bilingual educator in this modern world comes true, I am full of gratitude for all those who have encouraged and supported me up until this point. I am excited to make this dream a reality and am inviting you to graciously become yet another person to whom I owe my gratitude by helping me with a donation. Help me make my dream come true and there will be a direct correlation to the positive improvement of future generations. I am committed not only to the education of future generations but to also facilitate their self confidence by enabling them to express their questions, thoughts and dreams in both Spanish and English. </p><p> Les pido que porfavor me auyden realizer este sueño de ser meastra blilingue para que yo pueda enseñar a las próximas generaciones que sus sueños tambíen se puedan hacer realidad.</p><p>Gracias por su tiempo y consideración </p><p>Thank you for your time and consideration</p><p> </p></div>","Hello, My name is Georgia Tyrrell and I want to be a bilingual English/Spanish teacher.

Alliances compete by trying to score as many balls in goals as possible during 2½-minute match.  Additional points are earned by robots working together to score goals, and by throwing and catching balls over a truss suspended just over 5 feet above the floor as they move the ball down the field.  Our team has received a Kit of Parts made up of motors, batteries, a control system, a PC, and a mix of automation components – and only limited instructions. Students work with mentors and have six weeks to design, build, program, and test their robots to meet the season’s engineering challenge, which we do after school, working late nights and weekends.  Once the young inventors build a robot, our teams will participate in Regional and District competitions that measure the effectiveness of each robot, the power of collaboration, and the determination of students.</span></b></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-66bed27f-36a0-2bf3-5896-d9fb5cc66d3b"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;""><br/></span></b></p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-66bed27f-36a0-2bf3-5896-d9fb5cc66d3b"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;"">“This is more than a game.

Design and build state of the art robot playing team sports game
Work alongside professional engineers and mentors
Learn to use sophisticated software and hardware
Complete and cooperate in alliances and tournaments
Earn a place in the World Championship
Qualify for college scholarships
What We NeedThe team must raise $6,400 during these next eight weeks to send its 20 members to these two competitions. This amount will cover everyone’s meals ($1,500 per competition) and hotel stay for four nights ($3,400 for our away regional).We hope you will be able to make a donation to help our team travel to these Championships.   For your information the CCHS FIRST Robotics Team 702 is a tax-deductible endeavor through Culver City High School. Tax ID#: 95 600 0973. The ImpactFIRST Team 702 has been part of the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) non-profit organization for the past 13 years, taking on the six week challenge to build a functioning robot for the competition task FIRST assigns in the beginning of January. The varsity Sport for the MindTM, FIRST Robotics Competition combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Under strict rules, limited resources, and time limits, teams of 10 students or more are challenged to raise funds, design a team ""brand,"" hone teamwork skills, and build and program robots to perform prescribed tasks against a field of competitors.  It’s as close to ""real-world engineering"" as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team.The competition this year is Aerial Assist. Alliances compete by trying to score as many balls in goals as possible during 2½-minute match.  Additional points are earned by robots working together to score goals, and by throwing and catching balls over a truss suspended just over 5 feet above the floor as they move the ball down the field.  Our team has received a Kit of Parts made up of motors, batteries, a control system, a PC, and a mix of automation components – and only limited instructions. Students work with mentors and have six weeks to design, build, program, and test their robots to meet the season’s engineering challenge, which we do after school, working late nights and weekends.  Once the young inventors build a robot, our teams will participate in Regional and District competitions that measure the effectiveness of each robot, the power of collaboration, and the determination of students.“This is more than a game. This experience highlights what you will do in your careers,” said John M. Grunsfeld, Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters. “Experience in this competition is similar in many ways to how we design, build, and test NASA robots.”  “The students who participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition are not only building robots; they are building character, self-respect, and relationships with their peers,” said Dean Kamen, president of DEKA Research & Development and FIRST Founder, adding, “Winning the game is fun, but the importance of FIRST is that you’ll get much more out of it than you put in, and it’s going to change the rest of your life.”More You Can Do
