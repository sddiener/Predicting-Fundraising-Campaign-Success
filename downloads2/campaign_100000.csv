<div> </div>
<div>As many of you know when I was down on my luck, back when I was a younger man, and needed a job, Joe of Smokeless Joe's gave me a job with no experience as a server.  He helped me with a job and was extremely kind to me, even when I smashed 10+ cases of beer in the beer fridge one night.  Trained me to be a great server and made sure I had all the best shifts.  I even coached his oldest son to play net in hockey.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Joe had some terrible luck lately.  He has recently had to deal with some severe health issues, has lost quite a bit of weight, he is dealing with the finacial burden of being sick, especially since he moved his bar and the renos went 3 times over what he thought they would be.  He has to sleep on a futon in the basement of his restaurant to be close to the hospital, away from his family that lives in Thornhill.  His sons have to stay with their uncle many nights of the week, and Joe's wife has started working in the kitchen to be close to Joe and monitor him.  Joe needs a break!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are going to give him that break, even if it is for just one day!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On April 12th we are going to love bomb his bar Smokeless Joes which is at 488 College St.  We are all going to arrive at his bar around 7:00 and be ready to drink copious amount of beer, and have an amazing night.  Frig if you want to eat lots of food, well that would be great too.  If you owe me a favour, well I am cashing it in and you will come by and have a great night.  This is a night for all of us to get together, have a laugh and raise a glass.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is a celebration of friendship and how awesome Joe is.  He is not looking for pity, he does not want people to know he is sick... this is about support.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please! pass this along to friends and ask them to join you and why they should help.  This is important, this is bigger than all of us!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What do you need to do next?  You need to book the night off, and tell me that YOU ARE IN!  This night is a UWO reunion, a Pikes reunion, a work reunion, an ulti kick off. a hockey party, you name it...</div>

<h3><img alt=""Goatse Mail"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.goatse.cx/IndieTop.gif"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: top;""/></h3>
<h3>What is Goatse Mail?</h3>
<p>Goatse Mail will offer email addresses on the internet's most awesome domain: Goatse.cx. Users will be able to have their very own @goatse.cx email address using their existing Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail or Outlook.com account.</p>
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>Goatse Mail takes advantage of the relatively little known 'send as' functionality offered by the major webmail providers, including <a href=""http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=22370"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gmail</a>, <a href=""http://help.yahoo.com/tutorials/mmail/mmail/mm_accessother1.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yahoo Mail</a>, <a href=""http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows/outlook/other-email-accounts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hotmail </a>and <a href=""http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows/outlook/other-email-accounts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Outlook.com</a>. 'Send As' allows users to use their existing webmail account (eg. example@gmail.com) to send messages with another email address listed as the sender (eg. example@goatse.cx).</p>
<p><em><strong>Essentially, you will be able to send, receive and store your @goatse.cx email using your existing Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail or Outlook.com account.</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you have been allocated your @goatse.cx email account, setting up 'send as' in Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail or Outlook.com takes minutes. Sending email via your integrated email account is as easy as changing the email address in the pull down menu.</p>
<p>In this video I setup the @goatse.cx account in gmail.com and send email in 56 seconds while playing the piano: <a href=""http://youtu.be/CFY9YsTnMlc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/CFY9YsTnMlc</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How Much is Goatse Mail?</h3>
<p>Each account costs $50 for 10+ years.</p>
<h3>What Does '10+ Years' Mean?</h3>
<p>I wanted to offer accounts ""$50 For Life"" but for legal reasons I am unable to offer services ""For Life"". Instead, it is $50 with a 10 year service and I will then attempt to keep the service going without further charges. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Moore's Law"">Moore's Law</a> will have hopefully reduced the running costs significantly by 2023, and the email forwarding will likely be cheap enough for me to keep the service running in perpetuity. In summary - I have every intention of maintaining this indefinitely but for legal reasons I can only commit to 10 years.</p>
<p>The money pledged will be used to fund the maintenance of the email forwarding service and hopefully pay off the cost of purchasing the domain.</p>
<h3>Can I have my picture on Goatse.cx?</h3>
<p>Yes you can by choosing the 'Goatse Hall of Fame' Perk. Each picture must be of the dimensions 125X125 pixels. Pictures may be linked to the site of your choice. Pictures will remain on Goatse.cx for at least 10 years. All pictures and links must comply with the .cx (Christmas Island) registry <a href=""http://www.nic.cx/documents/CX/CX-AUP-NOV-2011.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Terms and Conditions</a>.

<h3>Why has this taken so long?</h3>
<p>Sorry it took a while to get this launched - I wanted to do this properly and provide a service that is comparable to the market leaders - Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail etc. The obvious option was to use Google Apps to offer Gmail on the domain, but this would have been too expensive ($50 per year per user).

I moved to Colorado three years ago from Kansas City,MO. I am passionate about storytelling,traveling, and people. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last summer I purchased a 1982 Volkswagen Westfalia Camper bus for 500$. I lived in the bus all summer and gained a huge appreciation for ""car camping"". In December 2012, I was on my way back from visiting family in Kansas City. I decided to take highway 36 through western Kansas. With a maximum speed limit of 55 mph, I felt a huge connection to the landscape and people I met along the way.

Last summer I purchased a 1982 Volkswagen Westfalia Camper bus for 500$. I lived in the bus all summer and gained a huge appreciation for ""car camping"". In December 2012, I was on my way back from visiting family in Kansas City. I decided to take highway 36 through western Kansas. With a maximum speed limit of 55 mph, I felt a huge connection to the landscape and people I met along the way. Traveling at a slower pace allowed me to observe more than I would have been able to on a normal interstate route.

<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">THE STORY</span></strong></h2>
<p>Tucked away in an oft forgotten corner of the world, Taitung is a rural city off the east coast of Taiwan with an area just under the size of Rhode Island. While Taitung boasts 10% of the country’s total area, it only accounts for only 1% of its population. Plagued by decades of brain drain and urban flight, Taitung has a population skewed towards the young and the elderly. While the rest of Taiwan has modernized and prospered, Taitung continues to struggle economically.</p>
<p>However, due to this isolation, Taitung has escaped the urbanization in most parts of the country and remains a pristine green idyllic haven that is a reminder of the island’s pre-industrial days. As part of an effort to revitalize the region’s economy, the government has rolled out initiatives in eco-tourism and valued-added agriculture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/PyAFzvD.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have identified a crop that offers a glimpse of hope for the region—Taiwan’s version of Kopi Luwak Coffee. Taitung is located on what the coffee world refers to as the “bean belt”, between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, where all the world’s finest beans are grown. Combine that with its natural isolation, moist climate and large mountainous regions (high altitude makes good beans), Taitung presents itself as the perfect location for growing coffee beans.</p>
<p>We met Mr. Ruan in a chanced meeting summer 2012. Mr. Ruan is a Taitung farmer who originally bred Formosan masked civets, the cats that produce the Kopi Luwak taste in coffee. He, along with his cohorts of 11 other famers, were selected by the government to see if they could reinvigorate the coffee industry in Taitung and Taiwan at large.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/HXQkw9Y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After three years’ into the government experiment, Mr. Ruan’s coffee has won accolades from the local press and anyone who has had the good fortune to sip his blend, but of the 1,000 acres of coffee plantation in Taitung County, 80% remain fallow.</p>
<p>As connoisseurs of Mr. Ruan’s coffee, we saw an opportunity to help Mr. Ruan and the people of Taitung better market their products globally and set out on a mission to put their coffee on the map.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">THE COFFEE</span></strong></h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/05VZVVC.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kopi luwak coffee originated from the colonial Dutch Indonesia when farmers discovered that certain species of civets would consume coffee beans and leave them undigested through their systems. Due to the civets selection process (they only eat the best), and the active enzymes in their digestion system react with the beans creating a uniquely original flavor. The most common assessment with our Formosan palm civet Kopi luwak coffee is that it is rich with a chocolate aftertaste and much less bitter than the average coffee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/Ci8DuhT.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The coffee beans in Ruan’s farm are only harvested three months a year, during the months of September, October and November, meaning the civets are only consuming coffee beans during those times of the year.. Averaging 3 to 4 kg of beans per year per civet, Ruan’s farm with 200 civets produces only about 600kg of coffee beans per year.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">GOAL</span></strong></h2>
<p>Farmers in Taitung have been growing coffee beans since 1912, but like Ruan, though they have perfected their techniques in producing coffee beans worthy of competing with the world’s best, they lack the business skills, means and knowledge to successfully market and distribute their coffee. Breeding and sustaining the civets alone cost up to 24,000 USD a year. My goal is to help Ruan market his coffee by, establishing an online retailing presence where consumers can buy the coffee directly from the Ruans, in short from farm to cup. By allowing farmers and consumers to connect online and bypass the middlemen, we allow consumers to purchase premium coffee more affordably and also allow the farmers to retain a greater share of the revenue.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/OiNXptM.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Your perks will directly help Ruan and farmers like him with the necessities to do what they do best (make awesome coffee) and to promote, package, market, and sell their coffee. Our initial approach is two pronged. Since the farm is very remote—45 minutes by car from Taitung city, we would like to first establish a retail location in downtown Taitung so that visitors can taste Ruan’s coffee and learn about Ruan’s story. At the same time, we would like to expand overseas via the internet, creating greater demand for our products.</p>
<p>In the long term, we hope to empower the area and its local population with the tools for self-sustainability. One of our visions is to transform the farm into an experitential eco-friendly plantation, where visitors can learn about the farming of coffee beans and see the wild civets in their natural habitat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/UqlkUeK.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, our goal is to stimulate the local economy through entrepreneurship. We hope that through our example, we can encourage more entrepreneurs and investors to invest in the region in a socially responsible way. Where possible, we are committed to hiring locally from the 200,000+ community in Taitung and training them with the skills necessary to build a small, yet global business. By hiring local staff and basing the company in Taitung, we want to keep as much of the salary and earnings earned through this venture recycled and reinvested into the community.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">RISK AND CHALLENGES</span></strong></h2>
<p>The greatest risk lies in the fact that coffee bean production is still a nascent industry in Taiwan and the accompanying ecosystem, e.g. logistics, experienced marketers, growers, etc. remain underdeveloped or few. As a result, initially the unit cost per pound of coffee may not be competitive in price to what consumers globally find acceptable. In addition, consumers unfamiliar with Taiwan may not be ready to associate premium coffee with Taiwan and be reluctant to purchase.</p>
<p>So, it might be a while till you see our coffee in Whole Foods or your local cafe, but we are prepared to win over one consumer at a time because to us, this is not just another cup of joe, but a social responsibility.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">OUR PERKS</span></strong></h2>
<p>Apart from our Kopi Luwak Coffee, Ruan has spent years developing a “simulated” blend, where he has attempted to enzymatically duplicate the taste of Kopi Luwak. Unlike Kopi Luwak, where the coffee beans are consumed by the civets, the simulated Kopi Luwak treats the coffee beans enzymatically to replicate the Kopi Luwak taste. We have coined the blend, Ecolique (or eco-friendly) beans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/iaxZKG7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","The World Cup The International Quidditch Association's World Cup is the world's premier quidditch event, where teams from the IQA's member nations compete for the title of World Champion. 
This campaign is part of the World Cup Expansion Fund, an initiative designed to increased participation from emerging areas on the international stage. What does that mean? 


All the funds raised in this campaign (up to €1500) will be matched by the IQA, effectively doubling the amount raised!
The team will struggle to attend the event without the support of this campaign. 
The international scope of the tournament will be vastly improved by the attendance of the team.

</h3><p>The good folks at <a href=""warmnsafe.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Warm and Safe, Inc</a> make heated suits for insane motorcycle tourists - the kind that choose to ""tour"" Canada and Russia in the off season.  Warm and Safe invented the first heated motorcycle suits many years ago.  They had been thinking about making a 24-volt system for wheelchairs but just never got around to it.  In 2011 I started bugging them about it so much that they decided it would take less time to develop a new product than put up with the constant nagging.   After a couple years of testing and patent bureaucracy it is finally ready.  Nick is set to be the very first owner in history of a 24-volt manufactured heated suit.  <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/191238/files/20131111190400-Warm___Safe_Heated_Gear__LLC_-_Shopping_Cart.pdf?1384225440"" src="""" style=""""/>Here's the cost breakdown:</p><p></p><ol>

The good folks at Warm and Safe, Inc make heated suits for insane motorcycle tourists - the kind that choose to ""tour"" Canada and Russia in the off season.  Warm and Safe invented the first heated motorcycle suits many years ago.  They had been thinking about making a 24-volt system for wheelchairs but just never got around to it.  In 2011 I started bugging them about it so much that they decided it would take less time to develop a new product than put up with the constant nagging.   After a couple years of testing and patent bureaucracy it is finally ready.  Nick is set to be the very first owner in history of a 24-volt manufactured heated suit.  Here's the cost breakdown:
$199.95 Jacket Liner
$185.95 Pants Liner
$79.95 Glove Liners
$69.95 Socks
$99.95 Dual Adjustable Controller (custom temperature controls for pants/socks and jacket/gloves)

That  comes to a total of $635.75.  These are the same prices as the regular 12-volt motorcycle versions.Here's a PDF version of the order.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

I took Marine Technician courses at CFCC which included boat handling and water rescue,among other things. I'm an avid bodyboarder, teach surfing along with weather,wave knowledge,and what lives in the ocean. I've ridden waves as large as 20 feet or so by paddling across a sharky inlet and then close to a mile out to sea. I competed in many bodyboarding contests, and worked as an Emergency Medical Technician at most of those contests. Red Bull held a contest called Project Swell which I entered and came in 4th overall and 2cd in the southern division. The ultimate goal of the contest was to decide when the wave size was right to run the Red Bull Icebreak surf contest. We had to turn in two forecasts per week by 7pm. My job was  forecasting for New York. We had to include wave size, a write up, our sources,and more. If they weren't on time, they didn't count. The top ten of us received a surf practicum from Surfline surf Forecasters. We got much more than that which I won't go into. I'll just put it this way, it was epic! As a bonus, I was the only person who wasn't in a weather program at a university. Weather has always been in my blood,thanks to my dad being a forecaster. He was thrilled about me being a winner and he's really excited about me doing this race.</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">At this point in my life, I'm seeking bigger goals and challenges. I've gotten to know Shawn Alladio of K38 Water Rescue and she is going to train me for this race and supply all the gear I need, including a new Kawasaki Ultra jet ski. My goal is to complete the race, make some good contacts, and work toward getting water safety and rescue more prevalent on the east coast, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152742737445414&amp;set=a.139094795413.231400.801905413&amp;type=3&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent-b-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-ash2%2Ft1.0-9%2F558500_10152742737445414_391124735_n.jpg&amp;size=950%2C633"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">and maybe even get into this.</a> The race is also a huge undertaking for me. I was sick for a couple of years and during that time I didn't get to surf or really LIVE. I was alive, just not really present. I also had left shoulder surgery during that time. I've been back in the water for about 2 years now and I'm right back to making big drops, doing airs, and getting barreled. Totally stoked to bodyboard again!  Acupuncture gave me life back. I'm still <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">not 100%, yet I have the drive to push on and believe that I can do anything! This is an amazing opportunity for me that I can't pass up and it would be an honor if you would help me complete this mission. </span></span></p><p>At this juncture, I need $800 to help fund the trip which includes the $250 entry fee, and pay a couple of bills before I go. I'm staying with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154120594130414&amp;set=pb.801905413.-2207520000.1402079740.&amp;type=3&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent-a-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-xfp1%2Ft1.0-9%2F1619235_10154120594130414_5688454335606749278_n.jpg&amp;size=870%2C580"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shawn Alladio</a> and going out a few days early so she can train me. We are going to go out to Catalina so I can get familiar with the waters and the ski. <br/></p><p>The LBCATRace is on July 20th and I'm flying out on July 16th for my training. The race won't be easy and I've been working out like a fiend to get stronger and will continue to do so until I leave. I want this so bad that I can taste it. I love to learn new things and take on challenges. They motivate me to do more and I've always liked helping people so water rescue is right up my alley. This may lead to that or more racing or both. It will lead to something bigger and better for me. If I don't reach my entire goal, I will still manage to make the trip. For those of you know me well; I will continue to help animals like always. Nothing will get in the way of that. Again, this is an opportunity that I must not let get away from me. I feel confident even knowing there could be rough seas and I haven't spent any time in CA. There is a sense of peace though that feels good. Visualizing is helping me focus on the goal and big life changes.</p><p>If you can't or don't want to help, it's all good.

I'm an avid bodyboarder, teach surfing along with weather,wave knowledge,and what lives in the ocean. I've ridden waves as large as 20 feet or so by paddling across a sharky inlet and then close to a mile out to sea. I competed in many bodyboarding contests, and worked as an Emergency Medical Technician at most of those contests. Red Bull held a contest called Project Swell which I entered and came in 4th overall and 2cd in the southern division. The ultimate goal of the contest was to decide when the wave size was right to run the Red Bull Icebreak surf contest. We had to turn in two forecasts per week by 7pm. My job was  forecasting for New York. We had to include wave size, a write up, our sources,and more. If they weren't on time, they didn't count. The top ten of us received a surf practicum from Surfline surf Forecasters. We got much more than that which I won't go into. I'll just put it this way, it was epic! As a bonus, I was the only person who wasn't in a weather program at a university. Weather has always been in my blood,thanks to my dad being a forecaster. He was thrilled about me being a winner and he's really excited about me doing this race.At this point in my life, I'm seeking bigger goals and challenges. I've gotten to know Shawn Alladio of K38 Water Rescue and she is going to train me for this race and supply all the gear I need, including a new Kawasaki Ultra jet ski. My goal is to complete the race, make some good contacts, and work toward getting water safety and rescue more prevalent on the east coast, and maybe even get into this. The race is also a huge undertaking for me. I was sick for a couple of years and during that time I didn't get to surf or really LIVE. I was alive, just not really present. I also had left shoulder surgery during that time. I've been back in the water for about 2 years now and I'm right back to making big drops, doing airs, and getting barreled. Totally stoked to bodyboard again!  Acupuncture gave me life back. I'm still not 100%, yet I have the drive to push on and believe that I can do anything! This is an amazing opportunity for me that I can't pass up and it would be an honor if you would help me complete this mission. At this juncture, I need $800 to help fund the trip which includes the $250 entry fee, and pay a couple of bills before I go. I'm staying with Shawn Alladio and going out a few days early so she can train me. We are going to go out to Catalina so I can get familiar with the waters and the ski. The LBCATRace is on July 20th and I'm flying out on July 16th for my training. The race won't be easy and I've been working out like a fiend to get stronger and will continue to do so until I leave. I want this so bad that I can taste it. I love to learn new things and take on challenges. They motivate me to do more and I've always liked helping people so water rescue is right up my alley. This may lead to that or more racing or both. It will lead to something bigger and better for me. If I don't reach my entire goal, I will still manage to make the trip. For those of you know me well; I will continue to help animals like always. Nothing will get in the way of that. Again, this is an opportunity that I must not let get away from me. I feel confident even knowing there could be rough seas and I haven't spent any time in CA. There is a sense of peace though that feels good. Visualizing is helping me focus on the goal and big life changes.If you can't or don't want to help, it's all good. You can always back me in spirt!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>I'm writing a book and YOU can be part of it!</h3>
<p>Hey there, thanks for visiting! My name is Hook...I am a musician, writer, adventurer, amateur photographer/videographer, nature-lover, and vegan. I am writing a book and YOU can be a part of it!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Incorporating my love of nature, writing, photography, and this wondrous and gorgeous country, I am embarking on a cross-country camping trek which I will document in my <strong>fabulous vegan-on-a-budget</strong> <strong>travel guide</strong>. With limited budget and resources, I will discover and recommend the best, most efficient, vegan, and earth-friendly ways to travel inexpensively (and stay healthy and safe) across the country.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Food choices for vegans are quite often not choices at all, and one must be prepared and aware, especially on the road. This book will not only offer convenient tips and tricks for vegans, it will be a hands-on guide for anyone wanting to travel or visit state and national parks, landmarks, and cities throughout the U.S. It will include safety and time-saving tips, while focusing on our need to treasure the amazing natural beauty in our own back yards, and the importance of respecting the planet and all its splendor. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will be leaving my home in Orlando, FL late-May, and camping my way clockwise around the country, returning mid-July. Conservation and preserving nature are very important to me, and I assure you I will make every effort to minimize my environmental impact along the way, as well as do <strong>Two Hands Projects</strong> wherever and whenever possible. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Al's Army/Navy Store</strong> has generously provided me with some very cool safety/survival items including a compact/lightweight all-weather blanket, a Columbia SPF 30 hiking shirt, a Guru multi-purpose tool, a lockable gun case, pepper spray, an extensive first-aid kit, a head lamp, insect repellent, and much more. Al's Army rocks! My waterproof Timberland hiking boots have been provided by <strong>Rack Room Shoes</strong>, and my backpack, bed roll, rain poncho, and sleeping bag were donated by <strong>Fox Hole Army/Navy Store</strong>. Emergen-C has kindly given me plenty of packets of <strong>Emergen-C BLUE</strong> to help me sustain good health and energy, and <strong>The Center for Biological Diversity</strong> has provided me with condoms to pass out along the way to help bring awareness about the many ecological problems caused by human overpopulation.</p>

<h3>From Sweden to Mongolia, the tale of 6 men, growing up.</h3>
<p>July 14th 2013, we set out on a journey of a life time, driving two piece of shit cars (<span>engine capacity of max 1.2</span>) from Sweden via <span>Czech Rep. </span>to Mongolia. We're doing this for charity, and with the hopes that it will give us some hair on our chests ... at last.</p>
<p>We're 6 friends who are standing with one leg in the I-still-think-I'm-a-teenager world, and the other in the adult world. We've all realised that it's time to take that big step into adulthood, but before we do, we want to go out with a bang. A huge fscking bang (Yes, File System Check Bang, what did you think we meant?), and document all the crazy insane shit we will do since this is indeed, our last journey as non adults.</p>
<p>During the trip, we will document everything, in pictures, videos, comic drawings and texts, which will all be shared with the world in order to help make it a little less big, a little less scary and a whole lot more fun.</p>
<p>We're cartoonists, writers, photographers and coders, so the things we'll make for the audience to enjoy during the trip will be endless, priceless and most probably funny as hell :)</p>

<p></p> <p>Clever Caps are bottle caps which are ready to be upcycled as building blocks instead of going to the trash bin.

Clever Caps project was born at the Brazilian company Clever Pack (<a href=""http://www.cleverpack.com.br/2011/en/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.cleverpack.com.br/2011/en/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cleverpack.com.br</a>). This crowdfunding campaign was set by the inventors Henry Suzuki (<a href=""https://br.linkedin.com/pub/henry-suzuki/0/36a/32b"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://br.linkedin.com/pub/henry-suzuki/0/36a/32b"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">innovation consultant</a>) and Claudio Patrick Vollers (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/claudio-patrick-vollers/66/13a/467"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/claudio-patrick-vollers/66/13a/467"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">plastic specialist</a>).</div><div><br/></div><div>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Where?</span><br/>
</div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The first product closed with a Clever Cap to reach the shelves will be a local Brazilian mineral water brand. We hope the impact of the first launch will increase awareness and about Clever Caps platform, and companies all over the world will want to addopt them in replacement of standard caps. Regarding to Clever Caps donations, we started by institutions nearby Sao Paulo city (Brazil) for we were able to deliver the caps without incurring in additional expenses for shipping. Contributors in other cities/countries can indicate institutions they want to donate Clever Caps. In that case, please use ""get Clever Caps"" perk option,</span><div><br/></div><h3>When?</h3><div>We were to make the first launch in April 2015, but we had problems with our low capacity molds. So launch was postponed. Expected launch date is now July 2015. For donations, we are still delivering remaining caps we had alread produced. Full delivery of all donations will be performed by october 2015 when we expect to have started production with bigger molds.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">How?</span><br/>
</h3>
There are many ways you can contribute with this campaign. For example:
</div><div><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Making a financial contribution (each dollar counts).</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Sharing this campaing with your friends.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Indicating to us charity institutions you would like to donate Clever Caps</span><br/>
</li>
</ul></div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>How Much?</h3>
The financial goal for our previous campaign was set as $ 100,000. That was the ammount we predicted for investment in higher production capacity molds for 3 Clever Caps models (round, square and rectangular), plus one additional round with incorporated safety seal. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We did not reach our goal, and noticed we should start smaller, and then increase production on an organic rate (more sales, more demand, bigger molds). </span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Now we set this campaign to $ 500 dollars, which is the minimum value allowed by Indiegogo. The idea is to make it very clear thar each dollar will make a difference for us and for the ones who will get Clever Caps donations. Each dollar will be converted into 10 caps for charity institutions. 10 caps are enough to build a flower. 20 caps are enough to build a small airplane. 1 cap will make most building block brands collections grow.</span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>By contributing with this campaign you will help not only Clever Caps project, but many charity institutions which will receive caps now as donations. In the longer term, we expect many more Clever Caps will reach people who most need them, but then for free, for the caps will be in the broad market replacing standar caps which now are thrown in the trash bin. Contributing with our campaign is a way to tell consumer products companies that you support ideas like the Clever Caps.</p>

If you don't have or don't like building blocks you can give your  Clever Caps to those who would like to play or build objects with them.

To learn more about Clever Caps, you can visit our previous campaing page right here at Indiegogo: www.indiegogo.com/projects/bottle-caps-which-can-be-reused-as-building-blocks.  Unfortunately, although we have gotten contributions from 142 friends, we had only few contributions outside our closest network, and did not reach our financial goal there. But we also had good news. And that is why we decided to launch this new campaign: As a fruit of our previous campaing, we started donating Clever Caps to charity institutions: Each dollar we got under ""donate Clever Caps"" was converted into 10 Clever Caps for donation.
The picture below shows  the first 9 Clever Caps donations. 


The institutions included daycare and recreation centers, public schools, orphanages, and a shelter for children/adults with severe cerebral palsy. The complete list of institutions we have donated Clever Caps so far (many more are to come) is available at this link. 
The success was so big that we decided to launch this new campaign and keep it running under ""InDemand"" so that more people will be able to be part of the history for both Clever Caps and many charity institutions. We will be happy to learn about other institutions not only in Brazil but all over the world. So, if you have indications, please let us know.
Below we have additional information about Clever Caps and our crowdfunding campaign in form of the traditional questions: What, Who, Where, When, Why, How, How Much.

What?
What are Clever Caps? In addition to the summary above, information about Clever Caps is available at the video below and also at our previous campaign page at: www.indiegogo.com/projects/bottle-caps-which-can-be-reused-as-building-blocks.  


What our campaign contributors will get? In addition to know they are helping Clever Caps project, our contributors will have 2 options for perks: 


Donate Clever Caps: each $ 1 will be converted into 10 Clever Caps to be donated to charity institutions.

Get/Send Clever Caps (set of 1,000 caps): $ 100 for 1,000 Clever Caps (pick up to 4 colors at your choice, in sets of 250 multiples). Shipping costs included (worldwide).



Clever Caps 4 x 250 = 1,000 Kit







Note: We decided to set the size of the Get/Send to 1,000 caps due to the high shipping costs. If you want to suggest other perks (e.g. lower number of caps, prebuilt objects, etc.), please let us know. 

What can I build with Clever Caps? Like any building block, there are many things you can build with Clever Caps. Just for example, here are some things which can be built with as few as 10 Clever Caps:

Flower (10 Clever Caps)





Airplane (20 Clever Caps)





Pencil Cup (60 Clever Caps)





Desk Organizer (156 Clever Caps, for lateral wall)




Box (1240 Clever Caps, for lateral wall. Approximate size: 37 cm x 37 cm x 30 cm*)

* As reference: a 9,5 cm x 9,5cm ""wall"" takes 30 Clever Caps

Letter ""B"" (240 Clever Caps, Approximate size: 32 cm x 37 cm**)

** You can ""draw"" or ""write"" with Clever Caps as if they were 31.8 mm x 9.6 mm pixels.

Car Body (4 Clever Caps)



Bottle Opener (1 Clever Cap)
For those with difficulties to open bottles, a single Clever Cap can be connected to a bottle closed with a second Clever Cap, and work as a lever. Then, opening will be much easier.
Building Block (1 Clever Cap)

As simple as that: Each Clever Cap is a building block. Under Clever Caps concept, what used to be trash will now be ready to be upcycled.

Who?


Clever Caps project was born at the Brazilian company Clever Pack (www.cleverpack.com.br). This crowdfunding campaign was set by the inventors Henry Suzuki (innovation consultant) and Claudio Patrick Vollers (plastic specialist).
Where?
The first product closed with a Clever Cap to reach the shelves will be a local Brazilian mineral water brand. We hope the impact of the first launch will increase awareness and about Clever Caps platform, and companies all over the world will want to addopt them in replacement of standard caps. Regarding to Clever Caps donations, we started by institutions nearby Sao Paulo city (Brazil) for we were able to deliver the caps without incurring in additional expenses for shipping. Contributors in other cities/countries can indicate institutions they want to donate Clever Caps. In that case, please use ""get Clever Caps"" perk option,When?We were to make the first launch in April 2015, but we had problems with our low capacity molds. So launch was postponed. Expected launch date is now July 2015. For donations, we are still delivering remaining caps we had alread produced. Full delivery of all donations will be performed by october 2015 when we expect to have started production with bigger molds.

How?

There are many ways you can contribute with this campaign. For example:


Making a financial contribution (each dollar counts).


Sharing this campaing with your friends.


Indicating to us charity institutions you would like to donate Clever Caps


How Much?
The financial goal for our previous campaign was set as $ 100,000. That was the ammount we predicted for investment in higher production capacity molds for 3 Clever Caps models (round, square and rectangular), plus one additional round with incorporated safety seal. We did not reach our goal, and noticed we should start smaller, and then increase production on an organic rate (more sales, more demand, bigger molds). 
Now we set this campaign to $ 500 dollars, which is the minimum value allowed by Indiegogo. The idea is to make it very clear thar each dollar will make a difference for us and for the ones who will get Clever Caps donations. Each dollar will be converted into 10 caps for charity institutions. 10 caps are enough to build a flower. 20 caps are enough to build a small airplane. 1 cap will make most building block brands collections grow.
Why?
By contributing with this campaign you will help not only Clever Caps project, but many charity institutions which will receive caps now as donations. In the longer term, we expect many more Clever Caps will reach people who most need them, but then for free, for the caps will be in the broad market replacing standar caps which now are thrown in the trash bin. Contributing with our campaign is a way to tell consumer products companies that you support ideas like the Clever Caps.",13.0,1,"2 Campaigns

In fact when you start looking at which backpacks most people use and how long takedown bows actually are, you realize that the Ranger is a truly unique bow specifically designed to fit INSIDE a backpack, requires no tools to setup or maintain, accepts sights and quivers and stores takedown arrows inside the riser. Now that's quite something in the bow world.</p><p> </p><h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3><p>With the huge popularity of our current folding bows and numerous requests to design another bow that can accept sites and other accessories, we decided to design a new backpackable takedown bow that not only fulfilled this need, but came in at a more affordable price point to make a compact takedown backpackable bow accessible to the majority of people.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586488726/oigyecrefdcbu7zolynk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Survival Archery Systems was established in 2014 and currently manufacturers all its bows in Lexington, Kentucky, USA</i></p><p> </p><p>The challenge was to develop a bow that could pack down into a small 22"" backpack, yet was long enough that it did not stack. Stacking is a phenomenon whereby a bow's draw force curve is smooth in the beginning of the draw and then suddenly shoots up at the end, making it almost impossible to draw it back further. This typically happens when a bow is too short for the archer or when the limb to riser ratio is incorrect.</p><p>For a bow to not stack for taller archers, it needs to be about 60"" in length or longer. And to get a 60"" takedown bow into a 22"" backpack is where the big design challenge comes in. That was a job for our lead engineer. </p><p><strong>Why is 22"" such an important dimension for ""backpack-ability""? </strong></p><p>Well, most outdoorsmen prefer to carry 1-day or 3-day packs into the field. These packs are about 22-23"" in length and are easier to move around with especially when on the hunt.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586488816/su6oekuch4xppd7gyjwo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>A standard sized one-day backpack used by many hunters.</i></p><p> </p><p>Our research showed that there are currently no 60""+ bows on the market that can fit into this length of backpack other than those already offered by our company, Survival Archery Systems, which was founded back in 2014 and continues to produce bows in Kentucky, USA even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some other bows come close, but the limbs are around 24-26"" in length when taken down and just don't fit. Bows with 22"" limbs are typically shorter than 56"" total bow length and therefore stack fairly quickly when used by taller archers.</p><p>Another important thing to consider is that most recurve limbs are not very compact nor robust when thrown around in a pack. As you will see later, we overcame the need for using a recurve style limb to reduce stacking by using a straight deep flex composite fiber limb that allows for a smooth draw and an efficient stroke and is super strong to boot. Deep flex is something traditional materials are just not as good at.</p><p>And don't worry about arrows being too long to pack either, as we have a solution for that too with our awesome takedown arrows we have been selling since 2014. These actually fit inside the riser of the Ranger Takedown Survival Bow and can be purchased separately.</p><div><div><div>

</div></div></div><h3>THE DESIGN CRITERIA AND RANGER TAKEDOWN SURVIVAL BOW DEVELOPMENT</h3><p>So our lead engineer got to work designing a new bow. Coming from 15 years in an automotive design and development environment he tackled this engineering project with the same skillset and advanced software used in that industry. Here are the design criteria he set.</p><p><u><strong>Design Criteria</strong></u></p><ul>
<li>Be made in the USA</li>
<li>31” Maximum draw</li>
<li>Be ambidextrous</li>
<li>Must not stack</li>
<li>Fit into a standard 22"" (559mm) backpack</li>
<li>Weigh between 2.4 and 2.8lbs (1,09 and 1.27kg)</li>
<li>Be durable</li>
<li>Be corrosion resistant and weather proof</li>
<li>Accept sites, quiver and arrows rests</li>
<li>Be shot with fingers or a release</li>
<li>Be shot off the shelf or off an arrow rest</li>
<li>Shoot quietly</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>THE SPECIFICATIONS</h3><p>After all was said and done and the first prototypes came off the production line we ended up with a bow that met all our design criteria and we were happy with every aspect of it. It had surpassed our expectations.</p><p>The final design is a riser and limb set that both measure 22"" and fit into most standard day-packs. Our bows will be manufactured at our factory in Kentucky, USA and will use corrosion resistant components throughout.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586489562/baiioylbi5tcw9eh3joa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The Ranger Takedown Survival Bow - Aerospace grade aluminum riser, hi-tech composite limbs, carbon end plates and 316 stainless steel screws.</i></p><p> </p><p>The riser is made from an aerospace grade T6 aluminum and can be shot both left and right handed simply by swapping the limbs around prior to stringing.

See further info under ""AVAILABLE POUNDAGE OPTIONS"" below on how this works.</p><p><strong>STEP 2.</strong> Add extra accessories to your order by choosing the perks just before checking out. The accessories page also scrolls to the right for more options.</p><p><u><strong>AVAILABLE POUNDAGE OPTIONS</strong></u></p><p>We have 2 initial poundage options available: 50# and 55# all measured at 28"" draw. Every person is different and the poundage you choose will depend on a number of factors including your height, strength, level of fitness, years of archery experience, etc. Depending on how much we raise we also have stretch goals for 45# and 40# as detailed below.</p><p>Here are some <u><strong>general guidelines</strong></u> to help you choose your poundage if you are totally new to archery.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Accuracy is the goal:</strong> This may sound silly, but what we mean by this is that everything you do in archery must allow you to shoot accurately. So when choosing a bow the first thing to consider is which bow poundage will allow you to shoot the most accurately. The answer to that is somewhat simple, but also somewhat complicated.</li>
<li>
<strong>Don't try be a hero (even though you may already be one):</strong> Archery is more about consistency than brute force. A heavier poundage bow does not always mean a better more accurate bow. The most accurate poundage is the poundage you can comfortably hold at full draw without straining and shaking. The less you strain and shake the easier it is to hold your shot on target and the more consistent you will be.</li>
<li>
<strong>A lower poundage allows for better form:</strong> The lower the poundage the easier it is for you to develop correct form and technique. And the better your form and technique the more accurate you will be. If your poundage is too heavy then you may develop poor form from using incorrect muscle groups to draw your bow and that will affect accuracy too.</li>
<li>
<strong>Draw length:</strong> Lastly, bows are rated at 28"" of draw. That means that a 50# bow will have a force of 50# on your finger when you draw the bow to 28"" measured from 2"" in front of the throat of the grip (more or less the front of the riser). A good approximation for draw length can be found by measuring the distance in inches from fingertip to fingertip with your arms stretched out either side of you and then dividing that measurement by 2.5. If you are above 28"" you have a longer than average draw and below you have a shorter than average draw.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>If you have a longer than average draw you will pull the bow back further than a shorter draw archer. A longer draw archer will therefore experience more force than a shorter archer with the same poundage bow. It is for this reason that we suggest that longer draw archers new to the sport err on the side of caution and choose a lower poundage than suggested for a medium draw archer.</p><p>On the same note a shorter draw archer will draw the bow less and therefore experience less force than a medium draw archer. So, he may be able to go a little up on the poundage.</p><p>At the end of the day it is important for you to choose a poundage that works for you and for the activities you choose to enjoy with your bow. If you are able to get to an archery store and try out a recurve or longbow to help you decide then that would be ideal. Don't get your poundage for a compound bow, as a compound bow is totally different because it has ""let-off"" at full draw, which means a compound bow of a similar rating is much easier to hold at full draw than a longbow or recurve bow. If you can't get to a store, then here is our very broad guideline to help you choose. This is for archers of a medium height corresponding to the weights given here. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586490131/zlmmhagdxxgyrszblrp2.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Ranger Ballpark Poundage Suggestions</i></p><p> </p><h3>STRETCH GOAL #1 - 45# BOWS AT $50,000</h3><p>Should we reach a campaign goal of $50,000 we will add Stretch Goal #1 to the project to help bring the 45# bow option to life.

As you can see, we have been working for quite some time on this and are pretty much done.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586496054/qlr2ofznpcbjegm4650r.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Current Project Timeline</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>NOTE: Depending on the number of backers please note that bows will start to be fulfilled in July, but some of the later orders may only go out at a later date as manufacturing capability allows.</strong></p><h3> </h3><h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h3><p>In all honesty I have decided to pull the launch of this bow forward by about 3 months due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past 2 months we have been full steam ahead producing our current line of bows as there are a lot of customers who are concerned that food security may become an issue as the pandemic progresses over the months ahead. Whilst I am not a fan of spreading fear I do understand that this may be of concern going forward. This is the reason for releasing the bow now as it is a cheaper option as compared to our current bows and therefore allows more people to access a compact bow option and because it allows for sites, it affords many the option of being less skilled with a bow than if no sites could be fitted. I have spoken to all my manufacturers and the current situation as at launch is that all of them will remain open for the foreseeable future. There is however a risk that this may change, although I am unable to quantify the probability of the risk. I think we all understand why. My aim is to start manufacturing as soon as I hit the $10,000 goal which will hopefully be in the early part of the campaign, so if all my suppliers remain open we should be able to fulfill orders according to the July timing. Also, because we have already made the major investments into the main production tooling and have production level risers and limbs already approved for production, it is only the small parts such as the logo plates as well as some refinement with our decorators that we need to iron out. These are the easy parts to produce and thus there is virtually no risk from a design and manufacturability point of view. We already have all our suppliers waiting for the go-ahead to put the parts into production for us. All we need is your help in backing this project to get the final small-part tooling made. With over 19 years as a design engineer and project manager I have no doubt in the suppliers I have chosen and their ability to deliver to the quality I expect from my automotive production background. These are longstanding suppliers I have used for years. I personally guarantee you that if we get the funding we will deliver a quality product to you.

In fact when you start looking at which backpacks most people use and how long takedown bows actually are, you realize that the Ranger is a truly unique bow specifically designed to fit INSIDE a backpack, requires no tools to setup or maintain, accepts sights and quivers and stores takedown arrows inside the riser. Now that's quite something in the bow world. THE CHALLENGEWith the huge popularity of our current folding bows and numerous requests to design another bow that can accept sites and other accessories, we decided to design a new backpackable takedown bow that not only fulfilled this need, but came in at a more affordable price point to make a compact takedown backpackable bow accessible to the majority of people.Survival Archery Systems was established in 2014 and currently manufacturers all its bows in Lexington, Kentucky, USA The challenge was to develop a bow that could pack down into a small 22"" backpack, yet was long enough that it did not stack. Stacking is a phenomenon whereby a bow's draw force curve is smooth in the beginning of the draw and then suddenly shoots up at the end, making it almost impossible to draw it back further. This typically happens when a bow is too short for the archer or when the limb to riser ratio is incorrect.For a bow to not stack for taller archers, it needs to be about 60"" in length or longer. And to get a 60"" takedown bow into a 22"" backpack is where the big design challenge comes in. That was a job for our lead engineer. Why is 22"" such an important dimension for ""backpack-ability""? Well, most outdoorsmen prefer to carry 1-day or 3-day packs into the field. These packs are about 22-23"" in length and are easier to move around with especially when on the hunt.A standard sized one-day backpack used by many hunters. Our research showed that there are currently no 60""+ bows on the market that can fit into this length of backpack other than those already offered by our company, Survival Archery Systems, which was founded back in 2014 and continues to produce bows in Kentucky, USA even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some other bows come close, but the limbs are around 24-26"" in length when taken down and just don't fit. Bows with 22"" limbs are typically shorter than 56"" total bow length and therefore stack fairly quickly when used by taller archers.Another important thing to consider is that most recurve limbs are not very compact nor robust when thrown around in a pack. As you will see later, we overcame the need for using a recurve style limb to reduce stacking by using a straight deep flex composite fiber limb that allows for a smooth draw and an efficient stroke and is super strong to boot. Deep flex is something traditional materials are just not as good at.And don't worry about arrows being too long to pack either, as we have a solution for that too with our awesome takedown arrows we have been selling since 2014. These actually fit inside the riser of the Ranger Takedown Survival Bow and can be purchased separately.

 
 
THE DESIGN CRITERIA AND RANGER TAKEDOWN SURVIVAL BOW DEVELOPMENTSo our lead engineer got to work designing a new bow. Coming from 15 years in an automotive design and development environment he tackled this engineering project with the same skillset and advanced software used in that industry. Here are the design criteria he set.Design Criteria
Be made in the USA
31” Maximum draw
Be ambidextrous
Must not stack
Fit into a standard 22"" (559mm) backpack
Weigh between 2.4 and 2.8lbs (1,09 and 1.27kg)
Be durable
Be corrosion resistant and weather proof
Accept sites, quiver and arrows rests
Be shot with fingers or a release
Be shot off the shelf or off an arrow rest
Shoot quietly
 THE SPECIFICATIONSAfter all was said and done and the first prototypes came off the production line we ended up with a bow that met all our design criteria and we were happy with every aspect of it. It had surpassed our expectations.The final design is a riser and limb set that both measure 22"" and fit into most standard day-packs. Our bows will be manufactured at our factory in Kentucky, USA and will use corrosion resistant components throughout.The Ranger Takedown Survival Bow - Aerospace grade aluminum riser, hi-tech composite limbs, carbon end plates and 316 stainless steel screws. The riser is made from an aerospace grade T6 aluminum and can be shot both left and right handed simply by swapping the limbs around prior to stringing. Our structural simulation software, Creo, has shown that the riser is theoretically capable of ""lasting a lifetime"" unless you are capable of shooting many millions of shots in your time. The below image shows one of our structural computer simulations of a bow at 31"" draw and over 70# of draw force. The colors indicate that this bow sees low stresses when compared to the strength of material chosen for the final production.Finite Element Analysis run using our advanced structural software showing low stresses under extreme draw force. The limbs are made from the same high-tech composite material that we have been using since 2014 and that are also used on most US made compound bows in the market. To date we have (touch wood) not heard of any of our limbs failing in the field. Note: These special limbs must be used together with an endless loop B-50 Dacron string so as to fit correctly into the string groove on the rear of the riser. Our limbs are not compatible with flemish twist or other larger diameter strings.The Ranger's Limbs are manufacture using a US made hi-tech composite material we have used since 2014 and which can be found on many of the US made compound bows on the market today. The total package weighs in at around 2.6lbs (draw weight dependent) and is able to accept sites, quivers and arrow rests using the ATA standard for mounting and threads.Ranger Specifications THE OPPORTUNITY - ""WITH YOUR HELP WE CAN DO IT!""In order to prove the concept we had to make the initial investment into the riser and limb production tooling, which was the major expense of this project. Now that we are happy with the bows performance and durability, we need your help to complete all the other parts that will refine and round the bow off.Your pledge will go directly into the manufacture of the molds and tooling required to produce these parts on a volume scale, as well as invest in the minimum order quantities for limbs. We have most of it covered, but need that last little bit of help from our backers.If things go really well and we far exceed our campaign goals then we plan on adding some extras poundages for 40# and 45# limbs ($15,000 investment per poundage). These we will add as per the stretch goals below so you pledge now may help us achieve those goals. As you can see, MADE IN THE USA is not cheap!!!Help us to get this project over its last hurdle and bring this awesome bow to life so we can help adventurers around the world spend more time in those hard to get to places few have ever been. THE REWARDSAvailable rewards - See poundage availability as well as Stretch Goals and how they work below if you require a 40# or 45#. Choosing a reward is pretty straight forward and involves 2 STEPS:STEP 1. Start by choosing your desired package from the list of rewards. 50# and 55# bows are initial available options, but if we reach the stretch goals below, the 45# and then the 40# bows will become available. See further info under ""AVAILABLE POUNDAGE OPTIONS"" below on how this works.STEP 2. Add extra accessories to your order by choosing the perks just before checking out. The accessories page also scrolls to the right for more options.AVAILABLE POUNDAGE OPTIONSWe have 2 initial poundage options available: 50# and 55# all measured at 28"" draw. Every person is different and the poundage you choose will depend on a number of factors including your height, strength, level of fitness, years of archery experience, etc. Depending on how much we raise we also have stretch goals for 45# and 40# as detailed below.Here are some general guidelines to help you choose your poundage if you are totally new to archery.

Accuracy is the goal: This may sound silly, but what we mean by this is that everything you do in archery must allow you to shoot accurately. So when choosing a bow the first thing to consider is which bow poundage will allow you to shoot the most accurately. The answer to that is somewhat simple, but also somewhat complicated.

Don't try be a hero (even though you may already be one): Archery is more about consistency than brute force. A heavier poundage bow does not always mean a better more accurate bow. The most accurate poundage is the poundage you can comfortably hold at full draw without straining and shaking. The less you strain and shake the easier it is to hold your shot on target and the more consistent you will be.

A lower poundage allows for better form: The lower the poundage the easier it is for you to develop correct form and technique. And the better your form and technique the more accurate you will be. If your poundage is too heavy then you may develop poor form from using incorrect muscle groups to draw your bow and that will affect accuracy too.

Draw length: Lastly, bows are rated at 28"" of draw. That means that a 50# bow will have a force of 50# on your finger when you draw the bow to 28"" measured from 2"" in front of the throat of the grip (more or less the front of the riser). A good approximation for draw length can be found by measuring the distance in inches from fingertip to fingertip with your arms stretched out either side of you and then dividing that measurement by 2.5. If you are above 28"" you have a longer than average draw and below you have a shorter than average draw.
 If you have a longer than average draw you will pull the bow back further than a shorter draw archer. A longer draw archer will therefore experience more force than a shorter archer with the same poundage bow. It is for this reason that we suggest that longer draw archers new to the sport err on the side of caution and choose a lower poundage than suggested for a medium draw archer.On the same note a shorter draw archer will draw the bow less and therefore experience less force than a medium draw archer. So, he may be able to go a little up on the poundage.At the end of the day it is important for you to choose a poundage that works for you and for the activities you choose to enjoy with your bow. If you are able to get to an archery store and try out a recurve or longbow to help you decide then that would be ideal. Don't get your poundage for a compound bow, as a compound bow is totally different because it has ""let-off"" at full draw, which means a compound bow of a similar rating is much easier to hold at full draw than a longbow or recurve bow. If you can't get to a store, then here is our very broad guideline to help you choose. This is for archers of a medium height corresponding to the weights given here. Ranger Ballpark Poundage Suggestions STRETCH GOAL #1 - 45# BOWS AT $50,000Should we reach a campaign goal of $50,000 we will add Stretch Goal #1 to the project to help bring the 45# bow option to life.

One option would be to use a velcro backing and your arrow rest of choice. Spare 60"" B-50 Dacron String - ADD $15OMP 60"" B-50 Dacron String - ADD $15 Neet Vented Armguard (Black) - ADD $15Neet Vented Armguard Black - ADD $15

 THE TIMELINEThe good news is that in order to develop our prototypes we had to invest in the tooling required for the riser and limb manufacturing up front. So the bulk of the project is already paid for AND the long lead-time items are already complete as you can see from our video showing the prototype parts which are off tool.The rest of the small parts and processes are easy parts of the project and production will start once we reach our funding goal and will follow the timing below. As you can see, we have been working for quite some time on this and are pretty much done.Current Project Timeline NOTE: Depending on the number of backers please note that bows will start to be fulfilled in July, but some of the later orders may only go out at a later date as manufacturing capability allows. RISKS AND CHALLENGESIn all honesty I have decided to pull the launch of this bow forward by about 3 months due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past 2 months we have been full steam ahead producing our current line of bows as there are a lot of customers who are concerned that food security may become an issue as the pandemic progresses over the months ahead. Whilst I am not a fan of spreading fear I do understand that this may be of concern going forward. This is the reason for releasing the bow now as it is a cheaper option as compared to our current bows and therefore allows more people to access a compact bow option and because it allows for sites, it affords many the option of being less skilled with a bow than if no sites could be fitted. I have spoken to all my manufacturers and the current situation as at launch is that all of them will remain open for the foreseeable future. There is however a risk that this may change, although I am unable to quantify the probability of the risk. I think we all understand why. My aim is to start manufacturing as soon as I hit the $10,000 goal which will hopefully be in the early part of the campaign, so if all my suppliers remain open we should be able to fulfill orders according to the July timing. Also, because we have already made the major investments into the main production tooling and have production level risers and limbs already approved for production, it is only the small parts such as the logo plates as well as some refinement with our decorators that we need to iron out. These are the easy parts to produce and thus there is virtually no risk from a design and manufacturability point of view. We already have all our suppliers waiting for the go-ahead to put the parts into production for us. All we need is your help in backing this project to get the final small-part tooling made. With over 19 years as a design engineer and project manager I have no doubt in the suppliers I have chosen and their ability to deliver to the quality I expect from my automotive production background. These are longstanding suppliers I have used for years. I personally guarantee you that if we get the funding we will deliver a quality product to you. Back our project and help us to bring this project to completion. To do so simply choose one of our rewards above and let us do the rest. Thank you for taking the time to view our project! Our team has worked hard so we hope you enjoyed it! To back our project choose one of the rewards of your choice. LONG LASTING DESIGNWe have designed the product using advanced structural software to ensure the product only experiences stresses below its material fatigue limit and thus it is deemed designed for what engineers call ""infinite life"". Using the same design principles and trusted software I used during my career as an automotive design engineer I have created a product that is both safe and durable. To date, we have not received any warranty returns from our current archery products since our company launch in 2014 and trust this product will show the same success. A NOTE FROM OUR DIRECTORMy name is Doug Shadwell and I am the founder and director of Survival Archery Systems which is situated in the heart of the Bluegrass in Lexington, Kentucky, USA.Survival Archery Systems - Established 2014 and situated in Lexington, Kentucky, USA. After a 14 year career as an automotive design engineer and project manager and having worked all over the world, I decided to pursue my own business in product development. I launched my first product under Survival Archery Systems which has been in business since 2014 and our current products are considered by many as the premium brand in their niche of compact folding bows. We also introduced a compact takedown bow, the Atmos, which serves the goal of taking us more into the regular side of archery so that we can increase our market share with all the products we have planned for the future. Our products are proudly made in America by American hands who share our passion for archery. A simple Google search for Survival Archery Systems or SAS  Survival Bow will will give you a good idea of our existing range. You may also visit our website at www.survivalarcherysystems.com for more info and details on what we do. Doug Shadwell - Behind his design station where he enjoys things most. I would like to thank you up front for backing our project if you do and invite you to contact me anytime during this campaign should you have any questions. I will personally be answering your questions so look forward to hearing from you.Best regards,Doug Shadwell",20.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>Like many stories, this one started with a bottle of champagne--our first thought after coming across Veuve Clicquot’s beautiful tangerine cover was that we wished we had more reasons to walk around with a bottle of champagne in hand.  Our second thought was, why should champagne have all the fun?  We set out to create a similar jacket for a regular water bottle.  It soon became clear that the concept offered more than just creating a pretty bottle cover, instead we might just be able to create a new kind of water bottle.</p>

<h3>Designed to Go with You</h3>
<p> Bend Bottle's unique attributes make it particularly well suited for life-on-the-go.    Light and soft, you can grab it by the handle or finger loop.  Hands full?  No problem--one finger it and head out the door.  Drinking is extra easy with a flip spout that’s covered when not in use.  It fits most cup holders and the quick access spout means you can safely drink and drive.  Quiet and spill-resistant, it's at home in the office, classroom, or gym.  If you're on the move, loop, cradle, or clip it and carry your water in comfort.   Perfect for travel, it squashes flat for packing. Soft and quiet, there's no“clunk” and it won’t break or dent when dropped.  Work, play, or somewhere in between, Bend Bottle is the hydration solution for active lifestyles. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi my name is Angelica. I am 17 years old and I was born in Colombia. I currently live in Miami, fl and I attend Calvary Chapel Christian church. This mission trip is my first one ever so I am super excited. I will be going with 11 members of my youth gorup and church. This project is really important to me because I believe it's an experience that will help me grow spiritually because I will be stepping out of my comfort zone and I will be going to another country for a whole week, to serve others in need. I will really appreaciate any monetary donation, it will not only benefit me, but people in Costa Rica who are yet to hear the good news of Jesus Christ and also you will be blessed. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will neeed 1,000 dollars to go to this mission trip. This money will help me pay for<span> all meals, airlines fares, transportation and housing, airport exit tax. </span></p>
<p>As a group we will be staying in Heredia, Costa Rica at the house of Juan Carlos Sanchez, who is the leader of the missioanry ministry ""Cave of Adullam"". We will be doing all kinds of activities to serve the community! For example, bullding houses and churches, painting, doing any house job. In addition, we are preparing skits with christian messages for audiences of all ages especially children!! so that they can have a good time and remember the lesson. Also, we will be visiting the poor homes of many Costa Ricans and we will be sharing the word of God, and his LOVE!!!! </p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal I will donate this money to the Cave of Adullam missionary ministry in Costa Rica. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe this project is very valuable because we will not only help people building their homes, or giving them physical food, but also giving them spiritual food. We will be bringing them joy, love and hope. I know these people will be grateful when they find out that there is somebody that really cares for them. I only know that the Great Commision Jesus gave us in Mattew 28:19 is not an option, is a commandment and I have decided to obey Him. The main goal of this mission is to evangelize and show people that they are not alone but that they have an all powerful God who is able to make possible the impossible, and that He is<strong> SO</strong> for us because He loves us! During this mission trip we expect to see many <em>miracles </em>and <em>changed lives</em> by the power of the holy spirit and the love of God. We will be casting crowns for his kingdom!!</p>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Hi my name is Angelica. I am 17 years old and I was born in Colombia. I currently live in Miami, fl and I attend Calvary Chapel Christian church. This mission trip is my first one ever so I am super excited. I will be going with 11 members of my youth gorup and church. This project is really important to me because I believe it's an experience that will help me grow spiritually because I will be stepping out of my comfort zone and I will be going to another country for a whole week, to serve others in need. I will really appreaciate any monetary donation, it will not only benefit me, but people in Costa Rica who are yet to hear the good news of Jesus Christ and also you will be blessed. 


What We Need & What You Get
I will neeed 1,000 dollars to go to this mission trip. This money will help me pay for all meals, airlines fares, transportation and housing, airport exit tax. 
As a group we will be staying in Heredia, Costa Rica at the house of Juan Carlos Sanchez, who is the leader of the missioanry ministry ""Cave of Adullam"". We will be doing all kinds of activities to serve the community! For example, bullding houses and churches, painting, doing any house job. In addition, we are preparing skits with christian messages for audiences of all ages especially children!! so that they can have a good time and remember the lesson. Also, we will be visiting the poor homes of many Costa Ricans and we will be sharing the word of God, and his LOVE!!!! 
If I do not reach my goal I will donate this money to the Cave of Adullam missionary ministry in Costa Rica.

Example of every-day carry items.
 During our search for an organizer to carry our own EDC products, we've learned that there are a lot of great organizers out there. However, there were two problems we encountered:1) There wasn't an organizer small enough to carry a lighter load that also gave us the ability to expand to carry larger items when we needed to.2) We found that a lot of organizers featured similar, limited strap configurations on both sides of their inner compartments. We wanted more strap versatility.This is what led us to design our own.Whether you’re a daily commuter, emergency responder, avid traveler, or work-from-home EDC enthusiast staying organized is important to be truly prepared for anything; especially when it comes to keeping those small or large every day carry items close at hand.
Compression & Expansion Zipper EDC organizers come in various sizes and capacities but ours is one size with dual capacity. So what we did was we took the expansion zipper feature from our ZIP Travel Waist Pack project 3 years ago, and put it into the organizer... This extra zipper is designed solely for expanding or collapsing the overall depth of the bag to give you more or less space for storing items. This helps you add larger things such as bandages and medicine bottles, or to save space when you’re traveling or packing light.GRID-STYLE STRAPSElastic grid-style straps isn't new to the storage industry, however to the best of our knowledge, they have never been used inside of a zippered EDC organizer until now...Example of every-day carry items inside the organizer.Our multipurpose EDC organizer provides you with plenty of storage straps for storing and securing all the little things you’ll need to provide emergency repairs, keep your tech device cables organized, or simply be better prepared for any camping or survival activities.Rugged MaterialsWe know that you might use this all-purpose EDC carry bag for some pretty serious outdoor or emergency response needs which is why it has high tear and puncture resistance and designed with reinforced zippers and pulls. Multiple Carry OptionsWe’ve added a small handle at the top of the bag for some quick grab-and-go use as well as two long MOLLE compatible snaps that let you attach it to larger backpack or bag so you don’t misplace it or leave it behind. Morale PatchesOn the outside of our rugged EDC organizer pouch you’ll find a Velcro (hook & loop) patch area that will let you attach one of your favorite patches such as a country flag, military unit, military branch, red cross, or a patch from the best TV show ever!*Patch not included. You can find this patch and many others on eBay, Amazon, Google search, etc.Water-Resistant FabricMade with water-resistant 500D fabric to help keep your gear drier on the inside when you’re traveling, working outside, or stuck working in a bit of inclement weather like rain or snow.Please Note: The organizer is NOT waterproof and does not float on water.YKK Zippers and PullsEach EDC organizer features thick pulls attached to the zipper base with reinforced silicone wrapped around them for added strength and pull resilience.VERSATILITYOur organizer allows a wider range of emergency response or outdoor travel gear while also adding a sleek, trendy look that matches its toughness. Example of tools inside the organizer.
 Weight: 8 ouncesWe went through several different design options. Here are the most recent illustrations showing the first and second styles which ultimately led to the final design. 
*Please note that you are pledging on the EDC Organizer ONLY. Every-day carry items (e.g. Apple AirPods, pocket knives, flashlights, tools, velcro patches, etc.) that are shown in the photos, videos, and animations are for educational purposes only. After the campaign, all backers will provide shipping information and confirm pledge rewards through BackerKit, where we will offer the opportunity to purchase additional EDC Organizers, ZEROHOUR products, and other accessories (ADD-ONS) to ship together with your reward. Instructions will be provided at the end of the campaign in a backer update.First Aid Survival KitWe understand that putting together a First Aid Survival Kit by purchasing items one-by-one yourself can be tedious. So to make things easier, we've teamed up with a manufacturing partner and put together an awesome package for you. The First Aid Survival Kit ADD-ON will include the following items:25 products totaling 240 pieces will make setting up your organizer a breeze. Available as a BackerKit ADD-ON for just $25 more! International Backers:Please check with your country's knife import laws before purchasing the First Aid Survival Kit ADD-ON.

The patch by itself will also be available as an ADD-ON.

<p>How do you take a duffel bag that's already awesome … and make it even awesomer?</p>
<p>After the Taskin Kube became such a global sensation with backers and customers in more than 60 nations, we spent months reviewing every piece of feedback we received on how to make this amazing duffel even more so. We evaluated the feasibility of each and every suggested enhancement, and we've implemented dozens of the biggest, brightest ideas from our loyal backers. And now, we're incredibly proud to present to you: The All-New Taskin Kube 2.</p>
<p>At home in the office, the airport, the gym and even the boardroom, the Taskin Kube delivers cool, confident style and functionality that’ll have you turning heads everywhere you go. <strong>No duffel does it better.</strong></p>

Forget about lugging heavy and awkward cases, or putting your precious instrument at risk with soft bags. The Kapsule is a sleek, wearable, rollable, and tech-loaded ""all-in-one"" musician's luggage!Why did we design the Kapsule?

Soft gig bags, while comfortable, don’t offer enough protection to check in.

Hard cases are good for checking in, but they’re a pain to lug around, they’re heavy and definitely not designed to be worn comfortably, if at all.
Both typically have very limited storage, and you almost always have to bring a 2nd roller or duffle bag for your clothes and toiletries.
So we took the benefits of all these and fused them together into one amazing bag that not only holds your guitar and accessories, but also packs your clothes enough for a 2- to 3-day trip! 
// Protect Your Axe
Trust your instrument to be well-protected in the Kapsule's tough polycarbonate shell. A thick layer of lightweight expanded polystyrene made of 98% air has excellent shock absorbency and insulation to keep your guitar or bass safe. The front of the Kapsule has a massive storage area of any gig bag for your tour-essential gear.
// Consolidate Your Luggage
You may also use that space to pack your clothes and leave your roller luggage at home. With 17+ liters of cargo space, there's enough room for a 2- to 3-day trip. Add our compression packing cubes (stretch goal #2) and you can fit nearly double!
 
​// Save Your Back With Wheels
Our snap-on wheels will make longer walks a breeze, and attaches in seconds without any tools.
 ​// Prevent Headstock DamageThe Kapsule's unique Iso Chamber minimizes the risk of headstock damage by keeping it suspended and isolated.
// Practice Anywhere
Want the freedom to practice anywhere, anytime? Our optional PLAY package is powered by our micro headphone amp small enough to fit in your hand! Simply plug in your headphones and audio player to practice privately. Enjoy dynamic hi-fidelity sound from the nearly-weightless amp, designed by world-renowned audiophile engineer Phil Jones. A 10-foot instrument cable and a 3.5mm auxiliary cable are also included.
// Keep It Charged
Staying productive on the go is easier with your devices charged! Our POWER package features our Oktane wireless power bank (10,000mAh) and two Oktane charging cables (one 6-inch and one 4-foot) with your choice of Apple Lightning or Micro USB. 
// 1 Year Free Peace Of Mind
We’re introducing our industry-first Global Recovery Tag (powered by HomingPIN) for peace of mind while you travel, integrated in over 2800 airports. When a baggage handler finds your bag, they simply type in your unique tag number into their lost-and-found system and you’ll receive a text message and email. A fellow travel can also simply scan the QR code, enter the tag number, and you'll be notified immediately. Service is free for one year upon activation.Using the anonymous tag number instead of a traditional luggage tag will also help protect your identity while you travel. 
// Find Your Kapsule By Voice
As our first stretch goal we’re enabling our voice-controlled Bluetooth Tracker (via Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, or Apple's Siri) as an add-on option for your Kapsule, complete with an iOS or Android app (powered by Chipolo). The tracker will not only help you find your Kapsule, but also lets you see its last location if it's out of range.

Well, it really isn't so far-fetched, at least not any more.</h3><h3>We have patented the new concept for powered drive in three dimensions, utilizing the reaction forces generated by spinning gyroscopes (flywheels, if you will). We have recently succeeded in building a demonstration/test model that utilizes a single pair of gyro flywheels. The world has not seen anything like it before, outside of what is recorded in the Book of Ezekiel. In fact, we often refer to it as the Ezekiel Project.</h3><h3>This unit moves on a smooth surface, utilizing ¾ hp and ½ hp motors. It weighs approximately 230 pounds, and the main pair of drive gyros rotate between 1000 and 1500 RPM.</h3><h3>The first video we chose for illustration above is a level, forward run, recorded on June 18, 2013</h3><h3>The second video is a backup, recorded on July 12, 2013. The change in direction of the unit was achieved by simple rotation in the opposite direction from the first.</h3><h3>

</h3><h3>Yes, we noticed that the motion is very awkward, that it was limited by the length of the power cords, and the purpose at that point was not yet an attempt to fly or raise and hover. We have also seen some of the strange but similar experiments posted by others at sites, such as YouTube.  Don't worry about those, because we have the patent and we are the ones who have figured out a way to get nearly as much power out of the unit as we put in! </h3><h3>Our project now is to use what we learned, and with some help, design, build and test a new model that will move in all dimensions, hover, and stay under control while the gyros are powered. We propose to do this by changing the power to weight ratio, adding some reorientation and stabilizing measures, and power it primarily by means of a gas engine.</h3><h3><br/></h3><h3>

Well, it really isn't so far-fetched, at least not any more.We have patented the new concept for powered drive in three dimensions, utilizing the reaction forces generated by spinning gyroscopes (flywheels, if you will). We have recently succeeded in building a demonstration/test model that utilizes a single pair of gyro flywheels. The world has not seen anything like it before, outside of what is recorded in the Book of Ezekiel. In fact, we often refer to it as the Ezekiel Project.This unit moves on a smooth surface, utilizing ¾ hp and ½ hp motors. It weighs approximately 230 pounds, and the main pair of drive gyros rotate between 1000 and 1500 RPM.The first video we chose for illustration above is a level, forward run, recorded on June 18, 2013The second video is a backup, recorded on July 12, 2013. The change in direction of the unit was achieved by simple rotation in the opposite direction from the first.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqqeh0_vN5k
The third video is a ramp run, going forward and up at a very modest 0.8% grade. This was recorded on July 13, 2013.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6uR0MvoNxw
Yes, we noticed that the motion is very awkward, that it was limited by the length of the power cords, and the purpose at that point was not yet an attempt to fly or raise and hover. We have also seen some of the strange but similar experiments posted by others at sites, such as YouTube.  Don't worry about those, because we have the patent and we are the ones who have figured out a way to get nearly as much power out of the unit as we put in! Our project now is to use what we learned, and with some help, design, build and test a new model that will move in all dimensions, hover, and stay under control while the gyros are powered. We propose to do this by changing the power to weight ratio, adding some reorientation and stabilizing measures, and power it primarily by means of a gas engine.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As avid travel lovers, our lives revolve around all things travel. We have spent years searching high and low for exciting gear for our adventures, but to no avail. Over and over again we had to choose between travel gear that looked good OR was durable and functional. We aired our frustrations with friends and found they shared our want of better travel products.  We noticed most packs were made for the primary purpose of hiking, not travelling. The result was ugly, top-loading bags, with straps hanging off everywhere that were less than ideal for travelling. </span></p>
<h3>We thought “Surely travel products could be stylish, without compromising on functionality?... maybe we were going to have to be the ones to do it”</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Thus the idea for Elephant Stripes began to grow…Two years, a fair bit of travel, many crazy moments and late nights later, Elephant Stripes has arrived with the perfect travel packs for stylish globe-trotters!!</span></p>

<p>The Bag for Bag donations programme is one of our favourite initiatives at Elephant Stripes. For every Travel Pack bought during this Kickstarter campaign we will give a school bag to an Indonesian child in need. </p>
<p>We've partnered with The Bali Children's Project; a wonderful not-for profit charity registered in both the United States and Indonesia. The Bali Children's Project sponsors Indonesian children to continue education where they would not otherwise be able to for financial reasons. It is based on the idea that if children are empowered with education, they are more likely to live a fulfilled life. The families they sponsor barely have money for food, let alone school supplies. The donated school bags will be a huge help for the families and something to treasure for the children!</p>

We were both lucky enough to grow up in the beautiful North Island of New Zealand, but always had a curiosity to explore what lay beyond our small country on the edge of the world. After meeting on our first day of university when we found out we were roommates, we quickly bonded over a passion for travel. Since then we’ve travelled extensively both together and separately to over 20 countries.

The Rainforest and the Geometric Explorer have plain black liners to make them more attractive to both men and women. The only difference in the features between the two sizes of bags is that the 65L pack comes with a zip on daypack, and has a lightweight frame to give it some structure.

As avid travel lovers, our lives revolve around all things travel. We have spent years searching high and low for exciting gear for our adventures, but to no avail. Over and over again we had to choose between travel gear that looked good OR was durable and functional. We aired our frustrations with friends and found they shared our want of better travel products.  We noticed most packs were made for the primary purpose of hiking, not travelling. The result was ugly, top-loading bags, with straps hanging off everywhere that were less than ideal for travelling. 
We thought “Surely travel products could be stylish, without compromising on functionality?... maybe we were going to have to be the ones to do it”
Thus the idea for Elephant Stripes began to grow…Two years, a fair bit of travel, many crazy moments and late nights later, Elephant Stripes has arrived with the perfect travel packs for stylish globe-trotters!!


The Bag for Bag donations programme is one of our favourite initiatives at Elephant Stripes. For every Travel Pack bought during this Kickstarter campaign we will give a school bag to an Indonesian child in need. 
We've partnered with The Bali Children's Project; a wonderful not-for profit charity registered in both the United States and Indonesia. The Bali Children's Project sponsors Indonesian children to continue education where they would not otherwise be able to for financial reasons. It is based on the idea that if children are empowered with education, they are more likely to live a fulfilled life. The families they sponsor barely have money for food, let alone school supplies. The donated school bags will be a huge help for the families and something to treasure for the children!

At Elephant Stripes we believe in always doing the right thing. For us that means implementing better business practices where possible, and always striving to do better by people and planet. 



We custom design and print all our fabrics. Both sizes come in the following six designs:








The packs come in two sizes - the 45 Litre pack which is carry-on size for the majority of airlines and the 65 Litre pack which comes with a 15L zip-on daypack (80L total)

<p> </p></figure></div><p>Some might correctly point out that we had published a timeline like this for our last campaign and we were delayed by over 10 months in shipping out the rewards. We have come a long way since then. The company was a garage startup started by silicon valley software engineers with little experience in the complexities of manufacturing and shipping real world products.

The world's most sophisticated will soon be shipping!  Imagine a backpack that can wirelessly recharge its built-in battery pack when you're home and charges your gear when you're on the go, one that gently alerts you if you accidentally leave it open while walking around, locks all key zippers at the push of a single button, keeps your info secure with RFID-shielded pockets, even acts as your camera mount when you want to take a picture; and, looks sleek and beautiful in your choice of great colors and so many thoughtful features. Now stop imagining it — and help us bring Barracuda Konzu to market and be one of the first to get this state-of-the-art backpack an an unbelievable price.From the creators of the ground breaking Barracuda Carry-on that raised 1.7 million in Crowdfunding - Konzu: The World's Most Advanced Backpack.   These days, you’d expect any smart backpack to come with a built-in battery pack, and Barracuda Konzu is no exception. What’s revolutionary is that ours can be wirelessly charged. Simply place Konzu on its patent-pending wireless charging stand, and top up Konzu's 10,000 mAh battery pack — without meddling with messy wires. You can even leave your tablet or phone inside the bag plugged into Konzu's internal USB port to charge it along with the battery pack.   All three version of the charging station will charge Konzu's built-in 10,000 mAh battery fully in 8 - 10 hours. Leaving your tablet or phone plugged in inside Konzu could increase the time by 2 - 4 hours depending on the battery capacity of the device left inside. The Premium Wood-Dual Charging station will, in addition, be equipped with a transmitter on its left shelf that can charge a Qi compatible device (or one with a Qi compatible case) in 8 - 10 hours.One Standard Wireless Charging Station will ship with every Konzu. To upgrade that to a Premium Brushed Aluminum/Wood stand add $39/$49 to your contribution for each Konzu in your reward you wish to upgrade. If you need more than one charging station (home/office) add $19/$49/$59 to your contribution depending on the model as shown in the table above for each additional charging station.The battery pack is removable & interchangeable. It can be charged directly via USB like other battery packs. Carrying Konzu with its battery pack into an airplane would be no different from carrying an ordinary battery pack. * Patents Pending Barracuda Konzu’s revolutionary Push-2-Lock system is the ultimate solution to pickpockets. Without compromising on usability with awkward hidden zippers or having to individually lock each zipper — Konzu's 4 external zippers (2 main and 2 pockets) can be secured with the push of a single button on the strap. The lock can be engaged with zipper pullers in any position with no power source required. Pressing down/up the lock will instantly lock/unlock the zippers in any position. It only seems like magic.* Patents Pending Ever find you’ve been walking with an open bag, just ripe for pickpocketing? Barracuda Konzu takes smart to a whole new level with integrated sensors that detect and alert you if you walk off with your bag open. Along with our Push-2-Lock system, this provides two-factor protection when you’re on the move.   * Patents PendingNo more awkward selfies. No more odd-man-out group shots. No more needing to find a good Samaritan to take a picture of you and your special someone. With Konzu’s detachable camera mount add-on and accompanying Bluetooth camera clicker, taking a photo of yourself or your group couldn’t be easier. The camera mount monopod attaches securely to an adaptor affixed to the bottom of the backpack, making it very stable. In addition to taking a selfie or a group (a “groupie”?) you can attach a GoPro and capture all the action on a hike or bike ride with ease.  The camera mount includes: A telescoping adjustable stand, attachments for phone/camera (like GoPro), adaptor affixed to the backpack into which the stand docks and a bluetooth clicker that works with Android and iOS.To get this camera mount accessory add $29 to your pledge.* Patents Pending Open every door in style—without ever misplacing your keys again. A perfectly located key pocket and heavy-duty retractable cord. This will also work well with scan cards and key fobs to get in and out of secured doors.* Patents Pending
Pokémon Go draining your battery? Or need to make that important call and your mobile phone is almost dead? Fear not: Konzu’s external US port is all you need. It’s built-in, 10,000 mAh wirelessly charged battery pack will keep you on the move long after your mobile devices would otherwise konk out. Need a place to stash that windbreaker or bike helmet, and there’s no more room in the backpack? No worries. Our expandable strap system gives you the extra little bit of storage you need to get your go on, in style. That’s right. Hit the security line without having to dig out your laptop and throw it in a tray. Just unzip the TSA-approved laptop sleeve and your Konzu conquers the conveyor belt with everything intact and ready to zip up and go.This section has two pockets, on the left for the laptop and the right for a tablet. The laptop pocket can fit a laptop up 17"" in size.  Skimmers can scram. The Konzu’s RFID-shielded pockets keep your personal data safe and secure. No breach at the beach. No treachery on the morning train. Who says you have to sacrifice style for comfort? Not Konzu, which comes with padding that makes even the heaviest of backpack loads a breeze. Konzu's pads are also designed to maximize airflow to keep your back cool and comfortable. You’ll wish everything in life came with padding like this.  The backpack can easily be attached to the handle of a carry-on —especially if you have a Barracuda carry-on. ""Everything is designed. Few things are designed well. – Brian Reed.""      Advanced water resistant lightweight fabric and covered zippers keep the inside dry.We didn't just want to design another backpack or just throw in a battery pack and call it smart. We set out to design THE backpack, a backpack like no other and we think we have succeeded. Now help us get it to market and get yourself this most amazing backpack at an equally amazing price. 
 Get two of the most innovative travel gear products ever made in an even more incredible deal. The Barracuda Carry-on is smart collapsible carry-on that backers like you helped bring to market. The carry-on is packed with cutting edge features like a built-in laptop tray and ergonomic handle. Learn more at https://barracuda.co/. Travel in style like never before.   
 Some might correctly point out that we had published a timeline like this for our last campaign and we were delayed by over 10 months in shipping out the rewards. We have come a long way since then. The company was a garage startup started by silicon valley software engineers with little experience in the complexities of manufacturing and shipping real world products. But now having manufactured and shipped thousands of products across the world we are far more capable of staying on schedule. This is not to say that we might not run into technical difficulties developing this fairly complex and cutting edge product. We are confident in our abilities to deal with delays and minimize their impact.As you may notice, the current prototypes featured in this campaign are already of high quality developed in partnership with a top manufacturer, a far cry from the garage made prototype of our previous campaign. We are Barracuda.

<p><strong>iCurious Travel: A Cultural China Guide for the 21st Century Traveler. </strong></p>
<p>Can travel make the world a more peaceful and prosperous place? I believe it can.</p>
<p>It is my dream to prove that by connecting more people and sharing across cultures the result of this interaction can indeed save humanity. Pretty big dream right?</p>
<p>For the past two years I have worked in the tourism and hospitality industry as a translator and guide in a small rural village in Yunnan Province in Southwest China. During that time, I have developed three assumptions regarding international tourism and the construction of cultural bridges.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">1. There is an immense curiosity in the US and the West about traveling to China, however most people lack the linguistic and cultural fluency to get around while in China or even know where to start when planning a trip.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">2. The current form of mass tourism in China and around the world is unsustainable, but there are positive trends of more sophistication and DIY Travel. For example, new technology such as <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=25.715786,100.511169&amp;spn=1.380775,2.430725&amp;t=h&amp;z=9&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">interactive mapping</a>, <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">online language training</a>, and <a href=""http://www.ctrip.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">self booking</a> websites are making quality and independent international travel more accesible deflating these mutually held misconceptions..</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">3. Connecting people and places online and in person over universal values such as family, food, and fun are essential in creating a more peaceful and prosperous 21st century Earth.</p>
<p>The solution is to link these three trends together in a new type of travel that incorporates personal growth, <a href=""http://the99percent.com/articles/7161/Why-Entrepreneurial-Thinking-Is-For-Everyone-Now"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">social </a><span style=""color: #0000ee;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">entrepreneurship</span></span> and mobile technology. I will present this manifesto in a cultural travel guide on Southwest China to be released on iBook for iPads in the Spring of 2013.</p>
<p>This is iCurious Travel.</p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong></p>
<p>iCurious Travel will be a new type of China travel guide explaining and highlighting cultural and language information through podcasts, videos, photos, creative writing, and slideshow presentations. This iBook will be sold both online and through download on the ipad. The goal of this project is to create a prototype for the next generation of digital, cloud based, and crowd sourced travel guides that can be downloaded through the<a href=""http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/app-store.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> itunes app store</a>. </p>
<p>The inspiration for this project originated while learning how to weave bamboo baskets in myspare time with an elderly couple in a neighboring village. Through studying this craft I was able to connect on a personal level given the language barrier. The couple could only speak their native Bai language and a thick Yaccent offset of mandarin. Regardless, I was able to learn more than just how to cut thin strips of bamboo. More importantly I learned more about myself including patience, persistence, and courage. </p>
<p>Building off this momentum, I want to travel to more places in Southwest China and learn more culture, the people who practice them, as well as learn more about myself in the process. From my experience I can relay this information to other travelers who want to participate in their own adventure in more remote places in China. </p>

<p class=""p2"">Chinese language social media will be a key component in finding valuable people and resources in China to connect with.

• What We Need •
We are estimating to be on the road for a total of 20 days, commuting between cities, setting up the backdrop and most and foremost, photographing. Even if we'd be living off the minimum costs of around 50€ per person for stays and some food, that's an overall of nearly 3000€ just on these basic things, not counting petrol, tolls, or other production costs that are inherent.

* UPDATE 29/10/2014 *
Europe's Famous Hostels are sponsoring our stays, so we are now just fundraising for petrol, tolls, food and some inherent production costs (running websites, hosts fees, international communications, etc).
Our departure date is October 13th and we return to Lisbon on November 2nd. Our desired route is just over 5600 kms, and should roughly follow the route Lisbon - Bilbao - Paris - Bruges - Amsterdam - Grenoble - Marseille - Barcelona - Madrid - Lisbon, which will cost an estimate of 1400€ on tolls and petrol alone.

The water of a cenote provides vitamin and mineral rich algae that nourish the skin, while also providing adventure and fun for many water sports activities. Cenotes were considered sacred by the ancient Mayans and many still claim to be able to feel the energy or even interact with ""Aluxes"" and other magical creatures.

We will keep you updated on our journey, sign up for updates at Awakening.mx.We’ll keep you updated every step of the way. But for now, it’s time to CELEBRATE!________________________________________________________________WHY DOES AWAKENING EXIST?HOW HAS IT ALL STARTED For many years, Martin had the vision and dream of creating a hotel experience that combines action sports and adventure with personal development activities. This dream never materialized due to a lack of time, hotel experience, and a real local network - until he met Adriana, a full-blooded hotelier with 15 years of hotel experience in the Riviera Maya. She had even already created the Awakening brand and a travel concept that allows diving deeply into the mysteries of Mayan culture - a perfect match. So they joined forces, in business and in life, to turn their dream into reality and thus following down the path of their own AWAKENING.   AWAKENING AWARDS - SHORTLISTED TWICE... ...FOR BEST INTERNATIONAL HOTEL DESIGN AWARD  AWAKENING - IN THE NEWS... ...BECAUSE OF ITS ORIGINAL CONCEPT & DESIGN____________________________________________________INTRODUCING AWAKENINGCONCEPT & DESIGNTRAVEL TO AN INCREDIBLE DESTINATIONTravel to the latest destination in Riviera Maya on the border of an amazing biosphere reserve. Our fresh water lagoon will mesmerize you with the amazing colors of Caribbean water. Our jungle canopy will caress your inner sanctuary. The Mayan culture and spirit will open new perspectives and horizons. And your cocoon will spoil you with comfort, incredible views and extraordinary ""barefoot luxury"" while making you feel one with nature.CONNECT WITH NATURE, YOUR BELOVED ONES AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY,  WITH YOURSELFRe-connecting to this moment - this is what Awakening essentially is all about. Once you connect to nature, you connect to everything. Living this present moment with all of your attention will create a deeper connection with your loved ones, with new friends and especially with yourself. Awakening lives this reality, and we express it in the design of physical spaces, experiences, the service and the concept as a whole.    BE HAPPY BY BOOSTING YOUR PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING We create and spread happiness - for our guests, our employees, our surroundings and also for ourselves. So beyond a great time away from everyday life, we provide the opportunity to engage in Awakening experiences that promote physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. Our guests choose the level and depth of their experience,  which can reach from ""just a fun and relaxing vacation"" to personalized well-being programs, designed by our personal development and happiness coaches, so everybody can take a piece of sustained happiness back home. ____________________________________________________
OUR HOME – LAGUNA NOPALITOSQUINTANA ROO, TULUM, MEXICO                       Awakening is located on the shores of the Laguna Nopalitos on the Caribbean coast of Mexico, 19 km/12 miles south of Tulum, one of LATAM’s most popular and fastest growing tourist destinations. Laguna Nopalitos looks like a Caribbean beach but actually is a ""Cenote"" filled with crystal clear fresh water. Fed by one of the world's largest underground river systems, it is surrounded by extensive, uninhabited mangrove and jungle. While close enough to all the amazing tourist attractions the region has to offer, its position right on the border of Sian Ka’an, Mexico’s largest natural biosphere reserve and UNESCO World Heritage Site, protects it from any type of large scale development.What is a Cenote and what makes it special?A ""Cenote"" is a surface connection to subterranean water bodies. In the case of Laguna Nopalitos, an asteroid fractured the Earth’s surface and created this freshwater body that is connected to the sea via underground rivers. The Awakening Site occupies 230 meters of Laguna Nopalitos' shore and contains an additional seven smaller cenotes that we found in the jungle. The water of a cenote provides vitamin and mineral rich algae that nourish the skin, while also providing adventure and fun for many water sports activities. Cenotes were considered sacred by the ancient Mayans and many still claim to be able to feel the energy or even interact with ""Aluxes"" and other magical creatures. We have not met them yet, but Laguna Nopalitos certainly is a magical place. ​____________________________________________________OUR EXPERIENCE - TRAVEL TO GROWDESIGNED TO PROMOTE HAPPINESSWhich is our mission?Our mission is to offer our guests an extraordinary, potentially transformational TRAVEL experience that combines high-end comfort, profound relaxation, exhilarating adventure and tons of fun with the option to engage in personal development activities for our body, mind, and spirit. At Awakening our guests RECONNECT with nature, with others and ultimately with themselves as they take a step beyond just a vacation, taking home great memories, new perspectives and skills, and increased consciousness for an even HAPPIER, healthier and more abundant life.Creating well-being and happiness is our mission. So in addition to an unprecedented location, we offer our signature AWAKENING PROGRAMS, designed by our transformation experts for those seeking a more profound personal development experiences and connection with themselves. Individual guided tours and recreational activities for you to renew your creativity, initiative, sensuality, passion, romance, friendship, family… or whatever part of your life that you would like to ""awaken"".AWAKENING PROGRAM EXAMPLES____________________________________________________OUR ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN PHILOSOPHY  DESIGNED TO CONNECT AND EVOLVEInspired by our Awakening philosophy about happiness, personal growth, and connection, our architectural team came up with an extraordinary design concept.WE DESIGNED A COCOON (OR ""CAPULLO"") AND OTHER AMENITIES... Our understanding of a hotel room is a ""Cocoon"", designed to protect and help you evolve.  ... THAT MIMIC NATURE'S SHAPES AND FORMS...The organic lines are based on geometry found in the natural forms of nature. Not by replicating these forms, but by understanding and applying the rules governing them....AND USE ELEMENTS OF SACRED GEOMETRY""Sacred geometry"" has its roots in the study of nature. We use elements of sacred geometry to synchronize you inside the ""Cocoon"" with your surroundings and, ultimately, the Universe.____________________________________________________OUR ""CAPULLOS'"" INTERIOR ""BAREFOOT LUXURY"" - BEYOND A HOTEL ROOM...Awakening is made for travelers seeking extraordinary and exclusive experiences combined with what we call ""barefoot luxury"". To us, nature is the ultimate luxury so our version of luxury has nothing to do with marble floors and golden faucets, but revolves around providing a way to experience nature in the most fun and comfortable way possible. So you can smell the jungle, feel part of nature and listen to the orchestra of life while being embraced by comfort and intimacy.   HOTEL FACT SHEETA SMALL, BUT HIGH-END ECO-BOUTIQUE HOTEL WITH A MAXIMUM OF 40 ROOMS  ____________________________________________________SUSTAINABILITY HOW WE MANAGE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTMother Nature is the main protagonist in our experience so a design integrated with and adapted to nature is a key component of our concept. We are implementing high standards of sustainability in our architectural design, construction, and operation in order to minimize environmental impact. We are striving to be a leader in the area of sustainable hotel operation in the Riviera Maya. Use of clean energy, waste reduction strategies, and high-end water treatment will allow us to minimize environmental impact. Low impact building materials are just one element of our sustainability strategy:____________________________________________________SOCIAL IMPACT SPREADING HAPPINESS IS OUR CONTRIBUTION Awakening will generate impact by increasing happiness on three levels:   _________________________________________________________ AWAKENING FOUNDERSThe Driving Force Behind the ConceptAs a couple working together, we can further deepen our relationship based on respect, freedom, and individuality, facing the challenges that working together involve and thus strengthening our spiritual connection and profound love. ""Is it always easy to be a mother, father, lover, best friend and business partner at the same time – of course not.

<p>FLET tumbler an excellent designed tumbler to keep the freshness and original taste in all kind of cold beverages and we add the stick in the center of the cup where we called FLET stick.

<p>FLET tumbler is grab to go easily, we researched the average human hand size all over the world, the outer diameter size is very comfortable to use with one hand.</p>
<p>We use food grade Stainless Steel material with double wall vacuum design with FLET. It’s endurance and no swirling clang noise that occurs when you put ice in stainless steel tumbler.</p>
<p>FLET stick inspiration came from the woodwind musical instrument. You’ll reach a new experience of your drinks like a classical flute playing around you in every single sip.</p>

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve been working on FLET for over a year, from the beginning idea to our sketching paper to 3D prototype design.</p>
<p>We created the first revision prototype in our backyard and we tested our prototypes numerously, we gave them to sample users in different lifestyles and their feedback helped us develop FLET until it’s fit in your hand.</p>
<p>Many manufacturers were sorted out until we found the right one that understand our conceptual design of FLET.</p>
<p>After consulting them for six months, our good relationship with manufacturer lead to the confidence in minimizing the risk of production. We’ll make sure the confirm delivery date is the actual ‘confirm’ date.</p>
<p>We set up the conference call with our manufacturer weekly to track the process progression and control the product quality to reach our expectation. Since the prototypes testing process, we also delivered them to our friends by using our logistic agent to make sure there’ll be no unforeseen issues when FLET launch.</p>
<p>The last challenge is the global situation on Corona virus, we shall pass through this with our manufacturer eventually. We take full responsibility for our product, you’ll be the first one to know the updates from us. Every product we ship will be alcohol sanitizer sprayed. We're FLET Co. and we work as a team.</p>

The last challenge is the global situation on Corona virus, we shall pass through this with our manufacturer eventually. We take full responsibility for our product, you’ll be the first one to know the updates from us. Every product we ship will be alcohol sanitizer sprayed.

<h3>Why Presta?</h3>
<p>Presta allows you to rent expensive outdoor gear for low prices from people near you. Outdoor gear is very expensive to buy new (a 4-person tent is $200-$300!), and is often used only a few times a year. The average camper only goes on 1-2 camping trips per year. For many, the high price to get outdoors is a barrier to their participation. Even if you are willing to spend the money, you can either order online from sites like Backcountry, Sierra Trading Post, etc. and wait for days, OR travel to a brick-and-mortar outdoor gear retailer like REI or a local outdoors store (<u>if</u> you have one near you - many people don't). And, since making a purchase means you're stuck with the gear for life, you have to research what you buy. Putting this much time into getting outdoor gear exacerbates the largest barrier to outdoor participation - feeling too busy to get outdoors.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way!</p>
<p>What if you could 'try out' gear or hobbies to see if they're right for you? No pressure to get it perfect on the first try or be out hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>What if you could get all the gear for your next outdoor adventure in just 5 minutes? No travel required.</p>
<p>What if it was <u>actually</u> cheap? We're talking $10 compared to $200. </p>
<p>And what if you could do it all right from your phone?</p>
<p>Presta is cheap (and convenient!). With Presta, you can save money on your outdoor adventures, try out a new activity or a piece of equipment before you invest in it, or get outdoors even when you're traveling and don't have your gear with you. We connect you with people in your area who are renting out the gear you need. </p>

<h3><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3>
<p>Share the outdoors. Our goal is to make the outdoors cheap, convenient, and more accessible for <u>everyone</u>. We don't want people to think of outdoor recreation as an extreme adventure (although it can be if you want it to!) or something that doesn't fit into their price range and/or lifestyle. With so much gear accessible at your fingertips for extremely affordable prices, we hope to make a weekend bouldering trip as plausible as, say, a trip to the mall. </p>

<p>We've been saying 'we' a whole lot. Well, 'we' are Kevin Delgado and Pallavi Shankar, seniors at Duke University studying computer science, and high school sweethearts originally from Cocoa Beach, FL. We both enjoy climbing, hiking, camping, and are passionate about making outdoor recreation accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>Pallavi studies computer science and biology, and in the summer of 2016 she was a full-stack software engineering intern at Lob, a 25 person, Y-combinator graduate, API start-up that focuses on automating print mail. She honed her skills in web application development and RESTful APIs while developing a grasp of how a startup is run. She brings her technical skills and design expertise to develop the best product and user experience solutions.</p>

<h3>How Presta Started</h3>
<p>As college students, we're lucky to have an on-campus recreational facility that does cheap, convenient gear rentals. However, not everyone has this, as we learned the hard way last summer in San Francisco.</p>
<p>We wanted to go bouldering outdoors for the first time in Yosemite, but didn't own a crash pad. We had been climbing indoors frequently, but hadn't made the investment to purchase a crash pad. And, since we were only there for the summer, there was no way we could have brought one with us on the plane. No problem, right? San Francisco is the land of Uber, Getaround, Amazon Prime Now; it's all about getting what you need as fast as possible. It also has a thriving outdoors community and three indoor climbing gyms. Yet, none of these places rented out crash pads. Not even REI. At REI, the cashier apologetically told us that if she could, she would let us use hers - it just sat under her bed most of the time...</p>
<p>and the seeds for Presta were planted.</p>
<p>Over the course of the summer, we ran into a few other scenarios where Presta would have been useful. Before a camping trip, we went to REI to buy things we might need at the last minute. A friend wanted to go camping while traveling, but didn't have any gear with her, and renting/buying there was too expensive.</p>
<p>So, we decided to start building Presta, an app for peer-to-peer gear sharing.</p>

</div></div>","Why Presta?
Presta allows you to rent expensive outdoor gear for low prices from people near you. Outdoor gear is very expensive to buy new (a 4-person tent is $200-$300!), and is often used only a few times a year. The average camper only goes on 1-2 camping trips per year. For many, the high price to get outdoors is a barrier to their participation. Even if you are willing to spend the money, you can either order online from sites like Backcountry, Sierra Trading Post, etc. and wait for days, OR travel to a brick-and-mortar outdoor gear retailer like REI or a local outdoors store (if you have one near you - many people don't). And, since making a purchase means you're stuck with the gear for life, you have to research what you buy. Putting this much time into getting outdoor gear exacerbates the largest barrier to outdoor participation - feeling too busy to get outdoors.
It doesn't have to be this way!
What if you could 'try out' gear or hobbies to see if they're right for you? No pressure to get it perfect on the first try or be out hundreds of dollars.
What if you could get all the gear for your next outdoor adventure in just 5 minutes? No travel required.
What if it was actually cheap? We're talking $10 compared to $200. 
And what if you could do it all right from your phone?
Presta is cheap (and convenient!). With Presta, you can save money on your outdoor adventures, try out a new activity or a piece of equipment before you invest in it, or get outdoors even when you're traveling and don't have your gear with you. We connect you with people in your area who are renting out the gear you need. 
If you already own gear, Presta is a great way for you to earn money without moving a muscle. Say goodbye to buyer's remorse. Instead of letting your equipment sit around collecting dust, list it on Presta and help other people experience the outdoors.

Adventure Islands is Westport's Premier Adventure Company. We have two superb locations for our land and water activities. Our land base is located in the town center on 480 acres on the grounds of the famous Westport House Estate. Our exclusive private Island is the home of our water activities only a 10 minute drive from the town. </p>
<p> We offer 25 different adventure activities suitable from 6 years and up, we have something for everyone.</p>
<p>The following is just a taster of the array of activities we have; Archery, Combat Games, Sky Challenge - Climb, Zip &amp; Jump, Laser Clay Pigeon Shooting, Sea Kayaking, Dinghy Sailing, Snorkeling, Sea Trampoline and lots more.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We
     Need 20k to buy a number of extra elements for the Sea Water Park, we already have Ireland largest Water Trampolines. We want to include additional capacity with inflatable climbers, giant slides, Bouncers, Flippers, Ice Tower, Spinners along with
     wet-area chillers for chilling out and having the best fun ever! Check out our Trip Advisor page, The Adventure Islands to see what people say about our Water Trampolines we have already. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>WHAT YOU GET: (Vouchers can be used on any TAI Adventure Activity) <br/><br/><p>€100  receive vouchers worth €200 for any TAI activity within 2014 season</p>

Details of our testing is noted below and we will continue to add content throughout our campaign. We've also included links to folders with dozens more images per airline. 
Alaska: https://bit.ly/2JEAn2W 

American: https://bit.ly/2HIgjfq

Next, we classified the tray table types and will include instructions on the final packaging to make install a breeze! If you are familiar with an airline not included above and recognize their tray table type, please let us know :D Our team tested the Crossbar in dozens of vehicles too! The ONLY headrest's The Crossbar did not fit on, was when the headrest itself was not height adjustable. Additional photos can be found here: https://bit.ly/2I5fnoS. And last, lots of luggage! Additional photos can be found here: https://bit.ly/2jlfTBg.  On January 7th, 2016, I [Craig Rabin, Inventor of The Airhook] lost my mother after a 33 month battle with cancer. Unfortunately, everyone seems to have a family member, friend, or colleague that is affected by cancer.The good news, is that due to advances in technology, medicine, and detection methods, more people are fighting and beating cancer! The number of people living beyond a cancer diagnosis reached nearly 14.5 million in 2014 and is expected to rise to almost 19 million by 2024.

The Cyber Blade uses a purposefully designed modified tantō as its blade shape. This unique shape utilizes the reinforced tip (kissaki) to provide superior strength and durability for carving and piercing; the straight line at the front of the blade also allows you to do scraping related work; the second angular point (yokote) between the front and lower blade section let you cut through things such as cables and boxes with ease; combined with the flat blade line, the Cyber Blade is perfect both daily tasks such slicing and cutting foods as well as emergency situation such as cutting seatbelts.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong><span dir=""LTR"">The Handle</span></strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593775395/eetm5lpmxwtbhzm87i58.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><span dir=""LTR"">The Cyber Blade is specifically crafted to endure the harshest environment and most challenge mission, that’s why we use Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy as its handle material.

Both opening mechanisms is intuitive and easy to access. To create a strong and easy-to-use safe lock, the Cyber Blade utilizes the frame lock mechanism. On the Cyber Blade, a part of the Ti-6Al-4V titanium handle is machined to be the frame lock. The use of frame lock satisfies both aesthetics and safety. Because of the high mechanical strength and the intrinsic flexibility of the Ti-6Al-4V titanium, this lock is extremely strong and safe. In addition, the inner tip of the 3D pocket clip also functions as over-travel-stop for the frame lock to prevent metal fatigue. Furthermore, to prevent wear down on the titanium frame, we added a harden steel insert in the contact area between the frame and the blade.

Like most the world, we spend the majority of our days sitting. From work, to lunch, to our daily commute - we are constantly sitting. By the time we arrive home from work, we’re mentally and physically drained, our head aches, our back is killing us, and we are in no mood to visit the gym.All this sitting in our lives made us think. We started wondering if the
 claims were true…? How does sitting all day affect our health? Well, we
 did some research and what we discovered was quite shocking.We were immediately frightened. More so, we were ready to put a stop to our bad back, head stress, and just - being tired all the time. In response, we spent the next several months creating, what we believe - is the best and most affordable product on the market to cure sitting disease. We happily introduce the LIFT Pro and hope it will improve your posture, mind, productivity, and health as it has for the team members at iSkelter.Our GuaranteeBetween IndieGogo and Kickstarter, iSkelter has successfully funded 12 products totaling $435,019 and 4,644 backers. Most importantly, we hold a 92% on-time fulfillment grade and continue to keep a 5-star post project rating on Amazon.Why We Need Your Help It's time to make LIFT PRO a retail 
product for everyone to enjoy. With your help, we will be able to 
purchase the materials and implement a streamlined production method. 
The entire production process will be completed in the USA at the 
iSkelter factory in Phoenix, Arizona. Shipping and Delivery Time:

<p>What is a World Scout Jamboree?</p>
<p>The World Scout Jamboree is above all an educational event that brings together the world’s young people to promote peace and mutual understanding and to develop leadership and life skills.</p>
<p>The 24th World Scout Jamboree will feature the hallmarks of past world jamboree programs, such as the Global Development Village, the World Scout Centre, a special sustainability initiative, and the socialization elements that allow participants to make lifelong friends from around the world.</p>
<p>Unlike any other youth event, the World Scout Jamboree invites you to surround yourself in diverse global cultures by joining your new Scouting friends at a single destination for 12 unforgettable days. The jamboree experience extends beyond your home—and beyond the boundaries of our countries—to create a global adventure that will last a lifetime!</p>
<p>Who Should Attend</p>
<p>The 24th World Scout Jamboree is an official educational event of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. It is specifically designed for young people ages 14 to 17 years old from National Scout Organizations, which are members of WOSM.</p>
<p>To be eligible to be a youth participant at the 24th World Scout Jamboree, you must be born between 22 July 2001 and 21 July 2005. If you are older on the given date, you may be able to apply to become a member of the International Service Team or contingent team, or a unit leader. The exact age requirements have been approved by the World Scout Committee.</p>
<p>The Jamboree Hosts</p>
<p>This 24th World Scout Jamboree is unique because it is a team effort by Scouts Canada, Asociación de Scouts de México, and the Boy Scouts of America. Our three countries are getting ready to welcome our Scouting friends as family to “Unlock a New World.”</p>
<p>The Theme</p>
<p>Our theme, Unlock a New World, invites you to unlock new adventures, new cultures, and new friendships. The theme was originally designed by youth representatives from our three host countries, also known as the “Dream Team,” who were responsible for presenting the original bid for the 24th World Scout Jamboree. Because our jamboree is being hosted in North America, it will be defined by the cultures found in the “New World” countries of Mexico, Canada, and the USA. This jamboree will provide a different view on the Scouting movement. Holding fast to our traditions of conservation and outdoorsmanship, a jamboree in the New World is a jamboree that embraces the growing trend of leadership development and global citizenship that our movement has cultivated.</p>
<p>The Summit Bechtel Reserve</p>
<p>The Summit Bechtel Reserve is a world class and sustainable Jamboree site and will host the 24th World Scout Jamboree. The Summit Bechtel Reserve is located in West Virginia, USA, and is comprised of more than 14,000 acres (5,667 ha) of beautiful forested mountains adjacent to more than 70,000 acres (28,328 ha) of national park in the scenic New River Gorge area of West Virginia.</p>
<p>The Summit Bechtel Reserve is one of the most environmentally sustainable human habitats ever built for Scouts. The Sustainability Treehouse is a living education center for Scouts, not only providing information, but also immersing Scouts in the concept of sustainability. Between the local timber used to build the structure, the rainwater recovery system and the wind- and solar-generated energy, the Sustainability Treehouse is not just a museum. Standing 126 feet (38.4 m) tall and featuring 4,000 square feet (371.6 square meters) of interactive exhibits, the Treehouse, along with the McAllister Family Sustainability Challenge Trail and other exhibits, will serve as the centerpiece of Scouting’s commitment to leave the world a better place. Sustainable practices will be evident everywhere you look, as they are at the core of the Summit Bechtel Reserves infrastructure, and sustainability will be a core part of the 24th World Scout Jamboree program.</p>
<p>The Weather</p>
<p>The month of July is characterized by warm weather, with daily high temperatures around 79 degrees F/ 26.1 degrees C and daily low temperatures around 62 degrees F/16.6 degrees C, and moderate to high humidity. The site typically experiences partly cloudy conditions during the month with the possibility of thunderstorms and rain showers.</p>

<p>Hi Everyone!</p>
<p>This is Nidhi, Vineet, Darshan and the Guiddoo Team who are passionate about travel and have been part of the travel industry for a long time.</p>
<p>Lets start with a story:</p>
<p>I (Nidhi) always wanted to go to the Eiffel Tower with my someone special. After 12 years of flying and numerous trips to Paris finally got to go with my husband Vineet. A trip of a lifetime which I had looked forward to for years suddenly became a trip to forget. In Paris for just two days found out that the Eiffel was closed on Day 1 and on Day 2 had a huge queue, couldn't get a ticket to the summit (others had a direct ticket and didn't need to queue) and missed out seeing the First floor. In Short a trip to forget or ""The Lost Trip to Eiffel Tower"".</p>

<h3>Problems pointed out to us include:</h3>
<p>Problem1: Poor packaging</p>
<p>Solution: In our final product, the packaging will be improved and optimized, will have better foaming to hold Trident securely in place, and not only that, the final product will come with a lot of supporting accessories. </p>
<p>Problem2: Silicone Padding on Trident comes off easily</p>
<div>Solution: In the final product, we will adopt industrial strength glue which will make it very hard for the padding to come off</div>
<div> </div>
<p>Problem3: Battery time and cable</p>
<div>Solution: 45 minutes for continuous low speed and 25 mins for continuous fast speed. The battery cable will be made thinner so that it fits better hence making it easier to put and remove the battery cover </div>
<div> </div>
<p>Problem4: Delayed turnoff</p>
<div>Solution: The problem is due to the spring in the switch because of which the longer you press the button, the longer the spring takes to go back to its original position. In our new model, we will use an improved spring technology which will recoil as soon as the user lets go of the button making Trident halt immediately.</div>

<h1>It has been well-documented that much of the disease, malnutrition and famine in the third world is related to the lack of clean, potable water. </h1>
<p>Despite the efforts of multi-national NGOs and millions of dollars of relief money, this problem still exists. The challenges seem insurmountable. Wells with traditional hand pumps are only effective to a depth of 150 feet. On top of this, most of the hand pump work is performed by children whose limited strength cannot pump beyond 100 feet. </p>
<h1>What if there was a solution to all of these complex issues? </h1>
<p>What if there was a technology that would allow a child to pump to depths 2-10 times that of traditional methods? What if the pump was made of plastic, a material with no salvage value to a thief? Think of how a simple solution could provide easier access to clean water to more than a billion people.</p>
<h1>Hydro Hand Pumps has the technology. </h1>
<p>What we don't have is the $50,000 to build our prototypes and start getting these pumps in the hands of the hundreds of water charities that already exist. Our objective is to produce a hand pump capable of pumping to depths greater than 500 feet. This is a conservative figure, as we are in the process of proving achievable levels of 1,000 feet or more. </p>
<p>Lake Washington Institute of Technology in Kirkland, WA, is donating their time and expertise to complete the initial design of the plastic hand pump. They will be working with the engineers from Hydro Pacific Pumps to ensure that the design fits with the existing technology. After this basic design is completed, the molds can be built - where the molds get built will depend on whether we can build the molds using 3D printing or they need to be machined.  </p>
<p>“A hand pump that can pump water at a rate of 2-5 gpm at a depth of 500 feet would change the dynamics of water well drilling/pumping throughout Africa, and it would handle probably 75% of the well depths in Africa. 1,000 feet would handle basically 100% of the water wells in Africa.” – Ted Kuepper, REM, Executive Director of Global Water</p>

<font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">Hi, my name is Makena Morley and I am a junior at Bigfork High School in Montana. I absolutely love to run, distance running to be exact, it is the most amazing thing in the world, it makes you feel good and it is so fun! I am fundraising money to help pay for my airfare and my hotel expenses to allow me to compete at the New Balance Track and Field Outdoor Nationals, my dad will be coming with me because I am not the best traveler by myself, so I would definitely get lost without him!

<p>Hi, my names North Nickel, a senior in High School and a cofounder of Nomad Plug. I’m part of an active family of 4 who is constantly outdoors: hiking, rock-climbing or hanging by the pool. Like most families we are constantly updating Facebook, listening to music, taking pictures or finding directions via some electronic device. Being heavy power consumers we frequently run out of battery power. </p>
<p>Two years ago I started searching for a portable solar device that could give us our power fix and was amazed at how incompatible, expensive and unfashionable the portable retail space was. I teamed up with my father to build a device that would solve these problems and I’m trying to get “thenomad” to market. </p>
<p><b>Incompatibility</b>: Most computers produce 0.5 Amps and 2.5 Watts of constant power via their USB 2.0 port. If you have a power source that falls below that threshold the battery stops charging. Most portable solar panels are rated for 5 watts or less. If the sun is impeded by clouds the solar cell can easily dip below the requirements needed to charge. </p>
<p>Some electronics have a voltage sensor such as the iphone5 which shut down the power port if the volts fluctuate out of a designated range. Since power fluctuation is dependent on sun intensity these devices can become useless with small cloud movement. </p>
<p>With “theNomad” we utilized panels rated for 7 watts allowing the necessary wiggle room for less than perfect conditions. We are also introducing theNomad with a rechargeable lithium battery pack allowing theNomad to charge the battery, while simultaneously allowing the battery to provide consistent power to any USB device. </p>
<p><b>Price</b>: 7w portable solar panels with a battery pack are priced well over $120. We are planning on retailing our solar panel with a lithium battery pack for $85. For those only interested in the solar panel we will be retailing the device for $75.</p>
<p><b>Design</b>: I believe we’ve created the best looking design on the market. The solar cell is small, water resistant, with a pocket to hold a batter pack. Every other solar cell on the market is currently black or camouflage and the battery pack is usually a second thought to the overall design.</p>

<p><b>What are Watts? </b>The Watt is the basic unit of power. It is named after the eighteenth-century Scottish inventor James Watt. Power = Voltage x Current, so Watts = Volts x Amps.</p>
<p><b>What are Volts?</b> Volts is a unit of electromotive force, the volt measures how much “potential” there is in an electric circuit. The higher the voltage, the more electrical current will flow through the circuit.</p>
<p><b>What are Amps? </b>Amperes (or Amps), is the measure of electric current. One Amp is equal to a number of electrons passing a point in a circuit each second at a certain voltage.</p>
<p>It all started with 2 simple solar cells and a circuit board. My first prototype was 2 X 2.5 watt cells hooked together in series to create 5 watts. I choose this configuration as the most demanding USB devices charged with 5 volts and 1 amp.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This solar cell worked great for most devices but those demanding devices would only charge between 11:00 am and 4:00 pm on perfectly sunny days. In the morning or evening 4 watts of power was common which lowered the amp and volts below the desired threshold. Back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>I changed to a more powerful solar cell with 2 X 3.5 watts for a total of 7 watts. This worked perfect and is the same configuration I currently use. However, this change created a problem as more than 5 volts can damage some USB products.  I finally solved this problem by adding a voltage regulator. </p>
<p>A voltage regulator generates a fixed output voltage that remains constant regardless of changes to its input voltage or load conditions. Basically the regulator compares the output voltage with a precise reference 5 voltage and adjusts the BJT pass device to maintain that constant output voltage.</p>
<p>I've made around 30 Nomad prototypes and I’m impressed with their capabilities.During testing cell phones and MP3 players charged within 1-3 hours. Smart phone, GPS, USB camera and lithium battery packs charge between 2-4 hours.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>TheNomad has been made, tested, and outperforms most solar cells on the market. We have been creating solar cells for several years and they have been my companion on many an outdoor adventure. The $5,000 I’m trying to raise will allow me to utilize a manufacture taking the heavy lifting out of my hands.</p>
<p>The largest risk I see is manufacturing theNomad in volume and having them shipped by Christmas. I've tested out the manufacture and have received samples in less than a week. I also have a contract with them guaranteeing production of 500 units every 2 weeks. This hasn't been tested and is a potential risk depending on the quantity sold.</p>
<p>I’m a senior in high school; however, my dad is a co-owner of the company. My father is a PMP which is a fancy acronym for a certified project manager. He has managed large multimillion dollar projects and I’m learning a lot from his tenure.</p>
<p>I'm setting a very realistic goal of $5,000. Once I have the funds I'll be able to get the items manufactured and in my hands by the end of November. It will be tight but I’m shooting to get your rewards to you a few weeks before Christmas.</p>
<p>It breaks down like this: Nov 1 is when Indiegogo ends. Then 14 days for Indiegogo to release the money to nomad. Then 14 days to get the gear made and shipped to me. Then another 1 or 2  to get it packed and shipped to everyone who pledged.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Bobby Mardis and I have been a filmmaker for the past 30 years developing all areas of content from an independent perspective for film and television.  I have worked on commercials with Maya Angelou, directed music projects with over two hundred musicians from Herbie Hancock to Freddie Hubbart, and narrative projects with Emmy Award winning actors like Glynn Turman. My passion is shooting content and making it come alive on film, then delivery to a broadcast exhibition.</p>
<p>My campaign is geared <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">raise funding to pay for the balance of court costs</span> as I fight for the rights for all creative people who live in apartments, do business out of their apartment creating and developing intellectual properties from music, to scripts, to film, to books, and anything that is considered an intellectual property. I am also fighting for the people who run all kinds of businesses out of their apartments. And lastly, I am fighting for anyone who has signed a rental lease agreement excusing the management of any negligence the management does.  All the monies raised will go towards fighting the legal battle. </p>
<p>This project is important because in Los Angeles and most major metropolitan cities, there are individuals who stand the risk of having their valuables stolen and never replaced by the insurance companies, AND ALL BECAUSE OF FINE PRINT CLAUSE THAT THEY ARE HIDING IN THE AGREEMENT. It is happening to me and if they win, it will open the door for other people to be ripped off as well. We won at summary judgment, but the trial is another story and it takes financial resources to compete with the big boys. This is important to me and every artist, or person who creates from their apartment. Should your work be stolen due to negligence, no hidden verbiage should shield the responsibility from the Insurance Company and the Owners. It is simply white-collar crime if is goes unaddressed and without a fight.</p>
<p>Your contribution, how ever large or small that you might feel it might be, will help and resemble one brick solidifying a wall of supporters.  You can shield us from the corporate moneygrubbers that constantly take from the little guys to keep the one-percenters in business. Right is right and wrong is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The accumulative fund that we are raising is $8,000 and it will help pay for expert witnesses, jury fees, lawyer fees, evidence demonstrations, copying, messengers, court filings and all aspect of line items that deal with the legal portion of this case. In order to fight them, we have to do it in court under the eyes of the law so that the end result sets the mood for all cases like this hereafter. We need you to speak up and support financially.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our goal is to pay for the ending stretch of this three-year legal battle.  All money raised will not only pay for the next wave of bills, but it will pay for the loans that were acquired within the first set of bills. We have to keep our eyes on the prize, which is justice for all artists working out of their apartments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project is unique in that it represents literally millions of people who either live in apartments and run businesses, or create intellectual property that has a lifespan that extends way beyond the life of the creator.  Your donation will help to preserve this freedom. Even though I am the plaintiff in this case, I am defending the right to work in the space that I pay a monthly rental and cherish the though of working without the fear of losing my hard work at the drop of a dime. That is all in jeopardy with this case. Your efforts will work for the good of maintaining the art of creative expression in the comfort of your apartment.  </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who need a little more information on the case, which is being tried in the Superior Court in Santa Monica, you can go on-line and conduct your own personal review. (Case No. SC116029).  This is one way to really contribute to society, stand up for justice, and voice your opinion about the out-of-control powers of corporations. Just like voting, your financial voice will make a difference in this case. You will walk away feeling the pride of doing something good for all people and particularly, people who use their space, creativity and imagination to create “something from nothing.” There is value in what we do!</p>
<p>I have creating many successful projects as evidenced by going to <a href=""http://www.BobbyMardis.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.BobbyMardis.com</a> and viewing some of my completed productions and video overviews.  The three films that were stolen were going to be three monumental projects that were geared to inspired, and evoke pride into the community.

We'll be touring Argentina to help South American men's leagues complete their requirements to join the Men's Roller Derby Association [MRDA]. Each league needs to play a game against a current member before they can join the MRDA.</span><br/></p>
<p>In 2012, the Shock Exchange went to England to help the first two European men’s derby leagues accomplish their goal of joining. Because of NYSE's UK tour, 15% of the MRDA member leagues are now located in Europe.  Then, In 2015, the Shock Exchange went to Australia.  Two leagues, Sydney City SMASH and the Brisbane Scartel, are now part of MRDA and we expect more to join soon. Now it is time for South America!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454192894/rwdufzedmbihdnigtwup.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""font-style: italic;background-color: initial;"">Photo courtesy of Hispanic Attack</span></p>
<p>Founded in 2007, the New York Shock Exchange is one of the first modern men's roller derby leagues to be established and a founding member of the Men’s Roller Derby Association. Always at or near the top of the MRDA rankings, we have a lot to offer to newly established and expanding leagues: exposure, instruction, and competition. A positive, grassroots, skater-owned-and-operated sport; modern roller derby in the past decade has inspired the establishment of some 800 leagues in the United States and 1,500 leagues worldwide.  It is part of the New York Shock Exchange's mission to contribute to the growth of the sport and community of roller derby by whatever means possible.</p>
<p>The Shock Exchange will play in the H.A.R.D (Hombres Americanos Roller Derby) tournament and scrimmage Team Argentina as well as run bootcamps in Buenos Aires and Cordoba. Teams we will be playing include the Buenos Aires Conspiracy and the Thunderquads, both of Buenos Aires, Contragolpe of Mendoza, and Terror S-Quad of Santiago de Chile, and in the last stop of our tour, we will take on the best of Argentina by competing against Team Argentina.  More info about the trip, the boot camps, and live streaming of the bouts is available at our Facebook page (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/nyshockexchange"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/nyshockexchange</a>) and <a href=""http://www.nyshockexchange.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nyshockexchange.com</a>.</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3><p></p>
<p>This will be an incredible experience for everyone involved, but it doesn’t come cheap. To send a single skater to Argentina, it costs nearly $1,500, which covers airfare, food, lodging, and transportation.</p>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to gather enough money to send just one of our skaters to South America. We will be supplementing your generous contributions with sponsorship, fundraising, and most particularly with money from our own pockets.</p>

</div>","The New York Shock Exchange is sending a roller derby team to South America and we need your help! We'll be touring Argentina to help South American men's leagues complete their requirements to join the Men's Roller Derby Association [MRDA]. Each league needs to play a game against a current member before they can join the MRDA.
In 2012, the Shock Exchange went to England to help the first two European men’s derby leagues accomplish their goal of joining. Because of NYSE's UK tour, 15% of the MRDA member leagues are now located in Europe.  Then, In 2015, the Shock Exchange went to Australia.  Two leagues, Sydney City SMASH and the Brisbane Scartel, are now part of MRDA and we expect more to join soon. Now it is time for South America!Photo courtesy of Hispanic Attack
Founded in 2007, the New York Shock Exchange is one of the first modern men's roller derby leagues to be established and a founding member of the Men’s Roller Derby Association. Always at or near the top of the MRDA rankings, we have a lot to offer to newly established and expanding leagues: exposure, instruction, and competition. A positive, grassroots, skater-owned-and-operated sport; modern roller derby in the past decade has inspired the establishment of some 800 leagues in the United States and 1,500 leagues worldwide.  It is part of the New York Shock Exchange's mission to contribute to the growth of the sport and community of roller derby by whatever means possible.
The Shock Exchange will play in the H.A.R.D (Hombres Americanos Roller Derby) tournament and scrimmage Team Argentina as well as run bootcamps in Buenos Aires and Cordoba. Teams we will be playing include the Buenos Aires Conspiracy and the Thunderquads, both of Buenos Aires, Contragolpe of Mendoza, and Terror S-Quad of Santiago de Chile, and in the last stop of our tour, we will take on the best of Argentina by competing against Team Argentina.  More info about the trip, the boot camps, and live streaming of the bouts is available at our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/nyshockexchange) and www.nyshockexchange.com.
What We Need & What You Get
This will be an incredible experience for everyone involved, but it doesn’t come cheap. To send a single skater to Argentina, it costs nearly $1,500, which covers airfare, food, lodging, and transportation.
Our goal for this campaign is to gather enough money to send just one of our skaters to South America. We will be supplementing your generous contributions with sponsorship, fundraising, and most particularly with money from our own pockets.
To thank our backers for your generous contributions, we have some great rewards at many different levels.
Tour Details
We will compete in Torneo H.A.R.D. on February 7th and 8th, facing off against the Buenos Aires Conspiracy, the Thunderquads, Contragolpe, and the Terror S-Quad.  On February 9th, we will be holding a boot camp for all attendees of Torneo H.A.R.D. before hitting the streets of Buenos Aires to celebrate Carnaval!  After enjoying the celebrations of Argentina's capital city, we will travel to Córdoba to take in more historical sights.  There, we will also face off against Team Argentina before holding one final boot camp in the country.

<h3>Présentation</h3>
<p>Le sport a toujours fait partie de ma vie, dont le basketball qui a pris une grande place. J'y ai joué pendant de nombreuses année et j'ai performé au niveau collégial AAA. J'ai aussi fait du flagfootball et de l'athlétisme avant de découvrir l'ultimate. Je participe aux compétitions nationales depuis 2007. J'ai remporté les grands honneurs à une seule reprise, participé à 5 finales et remporté une médaille de bronze au niveau canadien. J'ai aussi participé à de nombreux tournois américains (Boston, Sarasota, Las Vegas, Ohio, Columbus, New York, Philadelphie). J'ai eu l'argent aux championnat du monde par club en 2010 à Prague avec une équipe du Québec (Onyx) et l'or avec l'équipe nationale mixte en 2012, au Japon. Étant une athlete d'ultimate depuis maintenant 10 ans, je m'implique aussi dans le développement de la relève, depuis 4 ans, en entraînant les équipes juniors du Québec.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> Les fonds seront utilisés pour :</h3>
<p>Pour pouvoir être une athlète internationale à l'ultimate, je dois financer personnellement chacune de mes saisons. Cette année, j'aurai deux camps d'entraînement (Vancouver et Montréal), un tournoi préparatoire à Seattle et les championnats du monde qui seront à Londres. Pour tous ces événements, je devrai couvrir les frais de transport (3 billets d'avions), les frais d'hébergement, ma nourriture, les frais d'inscriptions et les frais de membre. D'autres frais d'équipe s'ajoutent, comme salaire de l'entraîneur et mon uniforme.

<p>Cet été, j'irai à Londres représenter mon pays pour une deuxième fois et je tenterai donc d'obtenir ma deuxième médaille d'or. Ceci est mon objectif et l'accomplissement de tous mes efforts.

CSJ advocates work on the ground—at the police station, hospitals and courts—advising government authorities on the law, supporting clients and monitoring the progress of cases.  They work with trustworthy partners to ensure clients and their families receive the care and support they need to begin healing from the trauma they have suffered. </p><p>For a short video on CSJ, please check out the video in our Gallery tab.  Their website can be found at <a href=""http://www.csjindia.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.csjindia.org</a></p><p><b>The Facts and </b><b>Why you should help</b></p><p><b>The need for legal support to victims of child sexual abuse is huge</b></p><p>· <b>Child sexual abuse is a serious problem in India</b>.  53.2% of children had experienced sexual abuse; 20.9% of children had suffered severe forms of sexual abuse, including rape. These percentages are staggering when you consider India has 1.2 billion people.</p><p>· <b>More women and girls are coming forward to report sexual abuse in Delhi</b>.

Location: Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India (see our gallery tab on this page for a peek at the image)Ø At the $250 level, a 20 card pack from HarmonyWishes and two fine art prints “Faded Love: Man” and Faded Love: Woman”, 6” x 9” images on 8.5” x 11” archival paper.  Location: Dungapur, Rajasthan,India  (see our gallery tab on this page for a peek at the image)Ø At the $500 level, a 20 card pack from HarmonyWishes and his most popular image, “A View of the World”, 21” x 33” on 24” x 36” archival paper. Location: Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India  (see our gallery tab on this page for a peek at the image)Ø At the $1,000, THE WHOLE ENCHILADA!  HarmonyWishes 20 card pack, ALL prints from each donation level and a huge THANK YOU! All gifts are from the heart.  Namaste.Note: Donations above the $1,575 Phase Two goal will be given to CSJ to support their mission, so don't stop giving!!The ImpactAbout CSJ: CSJ is a young organization that provides survivors of sexual violence free legal and psychosocial support throughout criminal proceedings, from when they report the abuse to police till judgment.  CSJ’s current project focuses on survivors of child sexual abuse in Delhi. CSJ advocates work on the ground—at the police station, hospitals and courts—advising government authorities on the law, supporting clients and monitoring the progress of cases.  They work with trustworthy partners to ensure clients and their families receive the care and support they need to begin healing from the trauma they have suffered. For a short video on CSJ, please check out the video in our Gallery tab.  Their website can be found at www.csjindia.orgThe Facts and Why you should helpThe need for legal support to victims of child sexual abuse is huge· Child sexual abuse is a serious problem in India.  53.2% of children had experienced sexual abuse; 20.9% of children had suffered severe forms of sexual abuse, including rape. These percentages are staggering when you consider India has 1.2 billion people.· More women and girls are coming forward to report sexual abuse in Delhi. Likely because media attention has increased after the gang rape and murder of a 23-year old physiotherapy student in December 2012, there were 1,636 rape cases registered with police in 2013, an increase of 132% from 2012 when 706 rape cases were reported.· Low conviction rates and delayed justice. In 2013, only 27.1% of rape cases in India ended in conviction.  A 2012 CSJ internal study revealed a 20.5% conviction rate in Delhi and criminal proceedings took an average of 28.7 months to complete. Victims and their families need advocates to support and fight for them during criminal proceedings, so justice and healing are possible.You’ve read the statistics.  Now here is a snapshot of CSJ’s cases:Our clients’ average age is 10 ½ years old.

Installing the system requires no tools or permanent modifications to your vehicle. After selecting to place the box on the driver side or passenger side and lifting the box into your trunk you just need to open and loosen the ratchet straps, clip the front strap hooks to the cargo tie-down anchor, and ratchet them until they are snug.For the back straps, hook the straps into one or two of the rear tie-down anchors (number of tie-down anchors required depending on tie-down locations in your vehicle) and ratchet them until they are snug. After that, it’s as easy as unlocking the drawers and sliding them open. We can’t guarantee fit in every car, but in most cases, if your vehicle has three to four tie-down anchor points and a large enough cargo space the Nomad Kitchen will fit. We recommend measuring your trunk to ensure there is enough room using our dimensions: - 25.75 inches deep (including the red lock tabs)- 14.25 inches high (from the top of the trunk sill)- 22 inches wide (including the ratchets)Disclaimer: Please ensure your vehicle has enough cargo space and be sure to check the strength rating of your vehicle’s tie-down anchor points before ordering. Nomad Kitchens come with two ¾” leveling risers to help clear small recesses and level the kitchen when parked on uneven ground. However, some vehicles with recessed trunk floors may require an additional riser to allow clearance for the drawers to slide out. If you don't already own a stove or water tank and want to add on one of our options,  make sure you select these during checkout.“Quite literally, it has everything and the kitchen sink.” - MotorTrend        The Nomad Kitchen is designed and assembled in California, USAusing domestic materials when available.

However, you won’t need to worry about maintenance issue indeed as Yonos e-bike uses the high-quality BaFang motor which is very durable.</p>

<ul><li style=""text-align: left;""><h3>Higher Performance</h3></li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The application of power assistance direct to the crank and therefore can take better advantage of the bikes existing gear system. Those gears let mid-drive to work efficiently at different speeds.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Getting kids outside is good...</h3>
<p>The research is overwhelming. Outdoor programs improve overall health, reduce anxiety, raise test scores, transcend language barriers, and teach critical life skills. Outdoor skills are life skills – leadership, collaboration, resource management, and decision-making cultivated in the outdoors translate seamlessly to all aspects of life! It’s no wonder teachers, parents, youth leaders, and schools want these programs in their curriculum.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519281711/jircj0lxekg5mmbdvhzk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>...but getting kids outside is hard...</span></p>
<p>Ever planned a group camping trip? It's tough. Arranging transportation, collecting gear, obtaining permits, and calculating just the right amount of food – all before the trip even starts! It’s even harder for a school or a church or a youth organization - now you need insurance, liability waivers, evacuation plans, and a way to move a lot of young people around.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520820041/upc9onz40abgjp7t6fx7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">...and getting kids outside is expensive.</h3>
<p>Most outdoor programs run upwards of $250/per person/day. That's a lot for anyone, let alone a teacher looking to provide an experience for an entire class. <strong>We can cut that price in half. </strong></p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520821367/juuak0miajllumaz6blp.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">B.O.A.T.  makes getting outside easy.</h3>
<p>The Bus for Outdoor Access and Teaching is an outdoor program…on wheels. While your typical outdoor program runs trips out of a warehouse, garage, or facility, our entire operation – from business administration to trip transportation – runs out of a bus. This allows us to reach more people right where they live, while offering trips for a substantially lower cost than traditional outdoor programs.</p>
<p>This is an especially huge benefit to organizations - by working with us they get an outdoor program on site, resolving the complications of running a trip while outsourcing liability and risk to an experienced 3rd party.</p>

<p>With the BOAT, you get a smooth ride and an all-inclusive adventure. We even take care of the liability - it's like having your own outdoor program right where you work or live.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We know all about O.A.T. But we need a B(us). </h3>
<p>We’re seven current and former outdoor educators looking for a better way to connect American kids with the wilderness around them by addressing common hurdles in accessibility.</p>
<p>Three of us started an outdoor adventure company  (it's still running successfully). One of us has already converted and built vehicles. We have a Leave No Trace Master, a National Geographic naturalist, and one of us works for Google which is definitely cool. We even have a registered 501c(3) - so if you donate we can get you receipts for tax deductions by the end of the year. </p>

</div></div>","Getting kids outside is good...
The research is overwhelming. Outdoor programs improve overall health, reduce anxiety, raise test scores, transcend language barriers, and teach critical life skills. Outdoor skills are life skills – leadership, collaboration, resource management, and decision-making cultivated in the outdoors translate seamlessly to all aspects of life! It’s no wonder teachers, parents, youth leaders, and schools want these programs in their curriculum.

...but getting kids outside is hard...
Ever planned a group camping trip? It's tough. Arranging transportation, collecting gear, obtaining permits, and calculating just the right amount of food – all before the trip even starts! It’s even harder for a school or a church or a youth organization - now you need insurance, liability waivers, evacuation plans, and a way to move a lot of young people around.

...and getting kids outside is expensive.
Most outdoor programs run upwards of $250/per person/day. That's a lot for anyone, let alone a teacher looking to provide an experience for an entire class. We can cut that price in half. 

 
B.O.A.T.  makes getting outside easy.
The Bus for Outdoor Access and Teaching is an outdoor program…on wheels. While your typical outdoor program runs trips out of a warehouse, garage, or facility, our entire operation – from business administration to trip transportation – runs out of a bus. This allows us to reach more people right where they live, while offering trips for a substantially lower cost than traditional outdoor programs.
This is an especially huge benefit to organizations - by working with us they get an outdoor program on site, resolving the complications of running a trip while outsourcing liability and risk to an experienced 3rd party.

With the BOAT, you get a smooth ride and an all-inclusive adventure. We even take care of the liability - it's like having your own outdoor program right where you work or live.

We know all about O.A.T. But we need a B(us). 
We’re seven current and former outdoor educators looking for a better way to connect American kids with the wilderness around them by addressing common hurdles in accessibility.
Three of us started an outdoor adventure company  (it's still running successfully). One of us has already converted and built vehicles. We have a Leave No Trace Master, a National Geographic naturalist, and one of us works for Google which is definitely cool. We even have a registered 501c(3) - so if you donate we can get you receipts for tax deductions by the end of the year. 
What we don't have is the bus - and that's why we need you. 

 

At this stage of the journey...
...we have a non-profit. Our logistical, risk management, and emergency protocols are in place. We know how much food to buy for a trip, what kind of gear we need, and how to take care of it. Our experienced education team can turn wilderness areas into classrooms for pretty much anything - math, social justice, history. 
We even know what we want the bus to look like - we just don't have it. 
 
 
...help us get over the next peak!
We hope to raise $6,000 to serve as the down payment on a quality bus. Anything we raise beyond that will go towards our $66,345 budget, every detail of which you can see here. We haven't picked a bus out yet, but we know what we want in the most important member of our team. 

The campaign you are looking at right now is our chance to kick it off. Any and all seed funding helps - we can take out a loan for a bus and start reaching out to grants, donors, and others. The more we raise now, the better the start (and the quicker we get on the road!).

Cool beans. It happens - can we ask why not?
Will it work? A bus? Is that really big enough?
Definitely. We've already prototyped this model, running programs out of vehicles on multiple trips. The downside was that these vehicles were small - it wasn't comfortable, even if it brought real value to the organizations we partnered with. 
We also know the bus can work - we've seen similar buses in action, though none of them were used for programs available to the public. Ours will be.

At only 6kg Jumpack is designed to be carried like a backpack as you ride, skate or scoot from location to location.
A 'Transformer' style deployment action allows Jumpack to be set up in a matter of seconds without the requirement for assembly at location.
Patented Anti-Slide technology incorporates two custom dampening units to ensure the ramp holds its position during use.
 'Jumpack is the most technically advanced ramp system on earth and a 'must-have' product for all action sports enthusiasts'  Jumpack has Patent Granted in the US and Europe and has a multitude of ingenious design features that makes the product work so well.   The 'Game-Changing' potential that Jumpack brings has also caught the attention of major media organisations resulting in coverage across Print, Digital & Online! Jumpack featured in Red Bulletin Magazine  Our story so far has been quite amazing! In 2016 the Jumpack concept won Northern Ireland's largest and most prestigious innovation competition ‘Invent 2016’. Later that year Jumpack competed against over 400 companies to reach the final of Pitch @ Palace 6.0, a UK wide competition organised by the British Royal Family.We were even invited to meet Queen Elizabeth II and tell her a little about the Jumpack project.In 2019 Jumpack is announced 'Best Start-Up Company in Northern Ireland' by IntertradeIreland Seedcorn.  

Inventor Phil McIntosh provides an introduction to Jumpack

Action Sports celebrities put Jumpack to the Jump test

    'No Limits' is now a reality..    Outside of being one of the first people on earth to own a Jumpack, you will have helped to ‘breathe life’ into one of the most game-changing products to hit extreme sports since the GoPro camera. To accompany your portable kicker you will also receive a super-low buy price at 30% below RRP and a FREE GoPro attachment worth $12.99. Get an amazing product at a 'one-off' price.. How you can help usNow that we have perfected and tested Jumpack we want to make it available to everyone, not just the sports stars that have helped with our testing program.To do this we require your help. The development of Jumpack has been expensive, the manufacture of the required tooling was more expensive again. But now we’re ready.All we require is the funding to purchase the materials required to start immediate production of ramps. This will result in quick delivery times for our backers. You Don’t Ride or Skate?It’s cool if you don’t ride or skate, there are other ways you can help.Do you have a friend, son, daughter, brother, sister, niece, nephew, next-door neighbor who does? Tell them about us. We guarantee that when they see Jumpack, they’ll want one.Use the Indiegogo share tools to share quickly and easily. Over the past five years Jumpack has evolved from an idea, to a concept and finally to a perfected product.A lightweight ramp that can be transported in its own custom backpack and ‘unfolded’ transformer style into a kicker ramp without the requirement for assembly before use.  Phil McIntosh - Product DesignHey everyone, let me tell you a little about myself. I was born in 1970 so I'm a child of the Evel Knievel generation. As such, I had little choice but to ride and jump bikes from a very early age.In the 1980’s, I became a Northern Ireland BMX Champion, in the 90’s a multiple Downhill Mountain Bike Champion, and in the 2000’s I even became an All-Ireland Downhill Mountain Bike Champion.Jumping bikes is what I loved then, and what I still love now. Phil in 1982     Phil with Jumpack in 2018     Sheldon Jimenez - Manufacturing & Materials ExpertSheldon is a graduate of Manufacturing Engineering and Management and is currently a Senior Project Engineer at RP Group LimitedAs a Project Engineer, he is responsible for helping clients develop their products from prototype to mass production.

What hit me though, was that our 'common' experience was 30 years apart.It appeared that BMX riders today were facing the same problem that we’d faced almost three decades earlier. Surely there was a portable ramp option out there that riders and skaters could take with them everywhere they go?As it turned out, there wasn’t and as a qualified engineer, I decided that it was time for this to change.

beautiful city of Waterloo is world renowned for many things, from prestigious universities,
award winning think tanks, to a blossoming science and technology haven. We
know this city has so much to offer to people who live here and visitors
alike.
We've
noticed that such a tremendous city like this is missing what so many cities around
the world have, a

city.

bike stations in the city, as a contributor you will get some amazing perks,

of helping to build a something that improves our great city.

Our Team
Meet the people who, with your help, will make the dream happen.

Prasad Samarakoon, Executive Director - Hi everyone, I founded Grand River Public Bike Share in 2012 and serve as Executive Director. I have been living in the Waterloo Region and raising my family for the last 10 years. After initiating this project with four of my friends, GRPBS have grown into a dedicated group of volunteers. I am a licensed Professional Engineer in Ontario, and a graduate of the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka with degree in Bachelors of Science in Civil Engineering.

Chitral Angammana, Director of Technology and Operations - I'm Chitral and a founding member of GRPBS. I am responsible for leading the organization technology development strategy including web and application development. I'm a green energy enthusiast and have extensive experience 
in Energy, Environment, and Climate change research. I received my PhD from the University of Waterloo in Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializing in Nanotechnology.

Maurice Kumalo, Manager Fundraising and Marketing Campaigns - Traveling around  the world I have seen some places with fantastic infrastructure. I really enjoyed living and visiting in places were bicycles were part of city life, Copenhagen, Nice, and Nagoya come to mind. When I found out that Grand River Public Bike Share wanted to build a bike share in Waterloo I leaped at the chance to join. I have an MBA from EDHEC Business School and a B.A. (Honor's) from the University of Western Ontario.

Sean Boisse, Manager, Business Development and Finance - I'm a recent grad of the University of Waterloo and understand that the Mr. Noodles and beer diet is a budgetary constraint and not a matter of preference (except for maybe the beer). I've been working on designing a system that is affordable for everyone without compromising on outstanding service. I have held a number of financial positions in Toronto and now am a Risk Analyst at a local financial institution. As an avid biker I would
love to see more Waterluvians on two wheels.
Anthony Milito, Marketing Team Leader - I am a strong believer that amazing marketing starts with amazing products and that when the two come together they can make the world a better place. That’s why I joined the Grand River Public Bike Share Team. Since coming on board I have been focused on developing a marketing and sponsorship plan that is designed to promote and grow this sustainable, efficient, and green method of transportation for the region. I was born and raised in the region, and am a graduate of WLU and a Marketing Manager at a local tech giant.

Kara Sharp, Communications Analyst - I'm currently attending the University of Waterloo for Sports Business and am in charge of communications at GRPBS; meaning PR, external communications, maintaining our social media presence, including blog posts and our newsletter to our our supporters in the community. In the future I hope to see active transportation
all around Canada.

Sean McGrath, Transportation Planner - It's a real honour and a great opportunity to be involved with GRPBS, helping to provide and enhance active transportation in Waterloo Region. GRPBS is a innovative organization, promoting the Region's image, engaging local businesses and municipalities while providing a public good. I take pride in being associated with GRPBS and look forward to it's successful launch in the
coming months.

Rachel Tucker, Transportation Planner - I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2013 with an Environmental Studies, Honours Planning degree. I was drawn to the bike share project because
I think, it is extremely important to further develop multi-modal transportation within the Region of Waterloo to reduce automobile use. I am conducting a demographic study on the city of Waterloo and will
be assisting in creating a station study. I am also working with a team to determine bike station locations to create the strongest network possible. 


Sherry Xue Qin, Transportation Planner - I received my Masters degree in Geography from the University of Western Ontario. My three years' experience in GIS strengthened my skills in map design and digitization, geo-spatial data analysis, and spatial planning. I volunteer at Grand River Public Bike Share as a Transportation Planner, which gives me a great opportunity to integrate my expertise with my interests. I am responsible
for creating GIS maps to visualize the relation between the locations and
demography and analyzing potential locations of bike stations for GRPBS
program. Pavit Kaur, Business Analyst - I am passionate about the pro bono
movement leading to active and positive social change. Being part of this
industrious team, I am committed to streamlining processes for more efficient
implementation of the movement. I have Master’s in Management from
University of Waterloo and strongly believe Grand River Public Bike Share will
make the city of Waterloo a healthier, greener and connected place marking a
lasting step towards a sustainable growth.
Purvi Koradia, Web Developer - Hi, Purvi here, I have a Masters in
Computer Application from India and moved in Canada almost two years ago now. Currently,
I volunteer as Web Developer in GRPBS, developing, maintaining, and improving
our website and its functionality. I also studied courses in Advance Web
Development from Conestoga College and online iOS developer course from the
University of Waterloo.

Sawsan Mahmoud, Manager of Policy Development - I am a
University of Waterloo graduate with a Master's degree in Management Science
Engineering. I've worked in the management consultancy field for eight years with
experience in quality management, project management, leadership, and training.
I have strong belief that believing in an idea, always turns it into reality.
This is why I have joined Grand River Public Bike Share.  My research includes innovation management, local
community development; so I’m full of passion for community serving initiatives.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After an early spring 2016 cruise, it was discovered that the area above one of our propeller shaft struts is leaking. The only way to properly address this repair and verify that no other damage exists to the hull, propeller shaft or propeller is to haul the boat out of the water. A recent visual inspection by a hull cleaning service shows that the bottom is in need of repainting and the damage indicates the shaft and propeller are in need of servicing.</p>
<p>Our current funds will not cover the entire cost of these repairs. Local industry professionals have offered trained technical staff to oversee our repairs. The best offer we have received from a local shipyard is more than our finances will currently handle. This offer does not cover the cost of materials necessary to complete the repairs.</p>
<p>The Pacific Youth Boating Association, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and Sponsor of the Sea Scout Ship Conquest, is running this campaign, among others, to help raise funds to cover these costs. Please help us insure that the centerpiece of our program – the Conquest – remains safe and trouble-free for years to come.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our repairs, which will be funded through this campaign, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haul Out at a local shipyard.</li>
<li>Examination of the areas in need of repair.</li>
<li>Clean and paint the bottom.</li>
<li>Replace one thru-hull and install two new thru-hulls and valves.</li>
<li>Repair strut plate</li>
<li>Replace strut bearings.</li>
<li>True shaft.</li>
<li>Balance or replace propeller.</li>
<li>Replace shaft seal.</li>
<li>Strip, prep and paint hull and boot top.</li>
<li>Strip, prep and paint cabin, pilothouse and signal mast.</li>
<li>Replace name graphic</li>
<li>Replace sacrificial zincs.</li>
<li>Repair handrails.</li>
</ul>
<p>To complete this project we will need to make several purchases, including:</p>
<p>Haul-out services at a local yard. (We have located only a couple of local yards that will allow us to do our own work.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Bottom paint</li>
<li>Topside paint</li>

<h3>Conquest</h3>
<p>Conquest is a former U.S. Navy Utility Boat. Built by the Harbor Boatbuilding Company in Long Beach, CA in 1965, she served aboard the USS Samuel Gompers (AD-37) from 1967 until 1989. Transferred to the Sea Scouts in Stockton, CA , she was later acquired by the Pacific Youth Boating Association in 1995 and transported to Long Beach. Since then, the Sea Scouts, with help from industry professionals, have transformed the empty hull into a cruising boat that is one of the most active boats in the Long Beach Sea Scout Squadron. Since her launch in 2003, she has made many cruises to points like Catalina Island, San Diego and other Southern California ports. She has also carried her crew on annual summer long cruises to the Channel Islands and other, farther points. In 2012 and 2015 our summer cruise visited San Francisco and Sacramento, a cruise of 12 days and 957 miles.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>The Pacific Youth Boating Association supports Sea Scouting in Long Beach through its sponsorship of the Sea Scout Ship Conquest.  </p>
<p>Chartered since 1963, the Sea Scout Ship Conquest provides an exciting program of good citizenship, education, leadership, seamanship, cruising and adventure for young men and women age 14 – 21. This unique program prepares them to make good ethical and moral choices over their lifetime as they learn the values of the Sea Promise, Scout Oath and Scout Law</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>No matter if you are able to donate, or can't donate, please forward this campaign to everyone you know who supports Sea Scouting, or wants to ensure that our local youth continue to learn through boating. Thank You.</p>

<div>I've got no eloquent spiel OR fancy campaign for you kiddos.

I am an entrepreneur from Vancouver B.C. Canada. When i was growing up i was always coming up with crazy ideas. I would attach fishing line to hooks i mounted in random spots in my bedroom. The line would be attached to my bedroom light switch so i could read in my bed and then when i was finished my book, i would pull the line and shut the light off. Yes.....a lamp would have been easier, but not nearly as fun....and aren't new ideas all about fun?? My mom always said i was a crafty little businessman. When i was in the 7th grade, i would buy a 2 pack of jawbreaker candies from the corner store for 10 cents, take them out of the plastic package, put them in an old Ferrero Rochet chocolate box that i had peeled the labels off of, and organize them in fun color patterns. Then i'd take the box to school and sell them for 10cents a piece, doubling my money. I wasn't into lemonade stands:) </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/233254/files/20131130120920-images.jpeg?1385842160"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Now that i'm all grown up, my passion for new ideas hasn't subsided in the least. I'm always looking for something fun and new......and then came the Kombo Fishing Tool. I hated tackle boxes. They were full of stuff that poked me every time i'd reach inside. That was the 80's. Since then, hook boxes were invented and my fingers were thankful. But there was still a lot of clutter in my dads tackle box (i've never owned my own tackle box. My dads was a museum and i always fish with him...so why bother?) ""There had to be a multi tool for fishing"", i thought. But nothing existed that was very useful, in my mind anyways. And the Kombo Tool was born. It was the ultimate fishing tool. A fish 'bonker', or priest as is the common name for it, with a fillet knife hidden inside of it. And why not have a sharpener attached to it and a scoop spoon for the guts? Oh....and if it was the brightest green color and it floated, that would probably be a bonus as well. So we got to work. We had the tool designed in Vancouver and had a local injection mould company start stamping them out. We built a website, got featured on uncrate.com, were woo'd by the largest retailer in the world, sold out at fathers day and this was all within 3 months of our start date! Now, 6 months later, we have distributors in Scandanavia, Australia and Vancouver and are working on 2 distribution deals with the largest companies in North America. We are going on 'As Seen on T.V.' and were contacted by Groupon to do a national campaign. We are heading in the right direction and now we need YOU! We need to raise money to fund our next shipment and as most of you know, any growing startup needs capital. We have purchase orders coming in constantly and it is the large ones that we are here campaigning for.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/233248/files/20131130120609-As-seen-on-TV-store.png?1385841969"" src="""" style=""width: 369.7916666666667px; height: 355px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/233253/files/20131130120715-groupon.png?1385842035"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>As i mentioned above, we are doing some really cool marketing campaigns. Going on T.V. or Groupon will put us in front of millions of people in the largest consumer market in the world, and we expect the orders will be massive.

If we can get the $50,000 dollars we are trying to raise, this will allow us to order close to 4500 units to fulfill some of these orders. All of the money raised will go to purchasing inventory. We have our business set up and have used family money and our own investment to get to where we are today. As we grow, we will campaign to raise larger amounts of money to fulfill even larger orders. <p>If we don't reach our goal, the money will still go to inventory. Some may go to travel costs for trade shows and some to marketing. If you are not convinced that I am driven yet, let me keep going.....I met with Bass Pro in May at their head office in Springfield, MO after hounding them with emails and phone calls for a month. The merchandiser and I hit it off and they are letting us set up a display booth at the front of their new store in Niagra Falls next April. I thought, 'if that worked, lets try someone else'. I like to think i have almost convinced Cabela's to do the same. We have been back and forth and i'm waiting for an answer this week. But hey, if they say no....i'll just keep emailing them and calling them:) Eventually they will say yes just to get me off their back.

We have gone the route of investor but there are so many risks that go along with it. And honestly, its no fun. And for the most part, they want to see a return on their investment....and thats pretty much it. We are not all about a bottom line. I love the ocean. I will live and die by the ocean. (watch the documentary 'Sharkwater') We are committed to sustainable fishing and will do what we can to keep the oceans and rivers teeming with fish. We have contacted the David Suzuki Foundation in the hopes to work with them in the fight for sustainable fishing and to help save the planet in general. </p><p>And yes, our tool kills fish and I may sound hypocritical, but it kills them humanely and one at a time. And we eat the fish we catch because they are a gift from God and essential to the normal function of the human body (google DHA omega 3). We were also inspired by Tom's, the shoe company that gives a pair of shoes to someone that needs them for every pair purchased. We want to be involved in giving back in someway to organizations that work towards keeping the earth healthy and fishy:) So we will give a portion of every tool sold, down the road, to sustainable fishing organizations, and we would love you to join us. </p><p><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kombo-fishing-tool/x/5391652"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kombo-fishing...</a><br/></p></div>","Hello friends,My name is Ryan.

And when Bass Pro is a success, i'll send Cabela's the pictures and my sales figures. That should do it! Your contribution is so important to me and to this business. We have gone the route of investor but there are so many risks that go along with it. And honestly, its no fun. And for the most part, they want to see a return on their investment....and thats pretty much it. We are not all about a bottom line. I love the ocean. I will live and die by the ocean. (watch the documentary 'Sharkwater') We are committed to sustainable fishing and will do what we can to keep the oceans and rivers teeming with fish. We have contacted the David Suzuki Foundation in the hopes to work with them in the fight for sustainable fishing and to help save the planet in general. And yes, our tool kills fish and I may sound hypocritical, but it kills them humanely and one at a time. And we eat the fish we catch because they are a gift from God and essential to the normal function of the human body (google DHA omega 3). We were also inspired by Tom's, the shoe company that gives a pair of shoes to someone that needs them for every pair purchased. We want to be involved in giving back in someway to organizations that work towards keeping the earth healthy and fishy:) So we will give a portion of every tool sold, down the road, to sustainable fishing organizations, and we would love you to join us. http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kombo-fishing...",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><br/><br/><p></p></div>","Let's face it, Johnny's competition isn't up to much. Most coolers aren't exactly pretty to look at and can't manage much more than keeping a few drinks cool, if that. Johnny Cool is so much more.
Hot summer days and nights with friends just got cooler. From backyard to beach, lake to tailgate, camping to crazy festivals...Johnny brings the party anywhere. 
Your next hang-out is about to become an unforgettable summer moment. Chill out with friends on the beach, blending delicious cocktails or playing the freshest summer tunes. Johnny’s got it covered. He runs on renewable energy and can party as long as you.
Johnny keeps things chill while you enjoy the warm outdoors. He’s perfect on tranquil breaks, too. Johnny can follow you across any terrain and carry the load. All that’s left to do is hang out with the people you love and find that perfect spot to unwind. 
Fire up the grill while Johnny cracks open the beers. He’s got the picnic table and settings sorted, too. Johnny Cool has thought of everything and is sustainable and organic. While you’re getting the fun started, let him charge your camera for that first group shot to kick off the season. 
Say cheese! It’s so good to have everyone together again. This time Johnny’s along to make it even better. It’s going to be the best summer ever :)
You bring that special touch to any party. Favorite foods, the freshest cocktail ingredients, games to play on the beach and the ultimate summer track list. Johnny is your buddy and he’s taken care of everything else. 
“If only we’d remembered to bring…” There’s no more of that. Johnny’s thought of everything and it’s all in one place, neatly packed, lightweight and ready to go. There’s no hassle or endless to-do lists in planning a day out anymore.
Johnny’s been designed with love and it shows. He cares about you and the planet. He lasts a lifetime and is made from sustainable and organic material. 
Keep your buddy by your side so you can concentrate on the important things. Fun, friends, family and perfect days out in the sun.



Warm sand, cold beers, Bluetooth sound system and the most chilled beach parties :)

By the water, in the woods, Johnny Cool is all-terrain and perfect for relaxed times away.

Blender, ice, fresh fruit and a spontaneous cocktail hour on the roof, watching the sun set over the city ;)

From the fishing line to the ice box to the grill, Johnny Cool kept our campfire feast super fresh...and we didn't have to carry a thing. 

So relaxed...Johnny Cool's solar panel soaked up the sun with us. Let the summer playlist play on...

<p>We are a small team from UCSB who are dedicated to a project that we believe will create a safer community after the wake of recent, shooting spree tragedies. Alongside our condolences to the victims, we would like to put forth something that will give us all a greater chance to protect our friends, neighbors, and loved ones from potential threats. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The purpose of this application aims to inform communities of a volunteer network of community members and businesses who have volunteered shelter in the case of an emergency. In the case of a city-wide alert or amber alert, this voluntary system will reveal users who have volunteered a shelter closest to the current user’s location. </p>
<p>Our application serves three main purposes to promote a safer environment for communities and neighborhoods: </p>
<p>Allows users <b>to volunteer their house or place of shelter as a first line of defense</b> to repel against an active shooter, local disaster, etc. in the community.</p>
<p><b>Directs a user to the safest available shelter</b> in the case of an emergency</p>
<p>Allows users <b>to coordinate safety measures and update information</b> through RSS feed and Messenger available on the App.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The applications of community safety currently exist in the forms of state-wide amber alerts as well as local government blog-feeds. Despite efforts to increase community safety through applications such as nextdoor.com (which allows neighbors to communicate) there needs to be an interactive system that directly protects community members. </p>
<p>Since the majority of mobile users in California use apple products during everyday use, the ""Always Aware,"" application will be trial tested for iOS users. Depending on the results of the trial test among iPhone users, we will continue to develop the application and further implement it to Android and other mobile carriers.</p>
