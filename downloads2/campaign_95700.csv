Our project has officially moved from the mass production phase to shipment. We’ve started shipping from now ‘til we fulfill all backers’ orders. The first batch of the UGREEN X-Kit was shipped from Shenzhen on Saturday, December 20.

Please note, the first batch shipment is on a first-come-first-serve basis acquired from the order of the payment. 


It all started with our product designer when he began #WFH this year. Beyond the great opportunities, like many of us, he found challenges in building a healthy and productive workplace at home. Most modern laptops today aren't equipped with enough ports to support all the supplementary devices we need to replicate a comprehensive ""second office."" Fear of insufficient ports and an unhealthy work posture was his motivation for creating the perfect work-at-home essential. Several factors can affect your work productivity, such as improper posture, excessive movements, forces, pressure points, static loads, and much more.   With the UGREEN X-Kit, you can personalize your workspace and create an atmosphere tailored to your physical needs and increase productivity. Feature HighlightsThe UGREEN X-Kit integrates all the necessary ports for easier connections to all your devices for a high-performance workstation at home. Working from home is now more convenient than ever before.  The 5-in-1 USB-C hub functionality provides 2*USB-A 3.0 ports, 1* 4K 3D HDMI port, 1*SD and 1*TF card reader, and 1*USB-C data delivery to connect your laptop or tablet with the X-Kit.  You can quickly transfer files, photos, and videos from your phone, memory cards, and hard drives while connecting to external devices such as the keyboard, mouse, or graphic tablet simultaneously, without a mess. Sitting all day is harmful to your health, but we will always find a better solution when this has already covered most of the working time. Find your best ergonomic posture with 4 adjustable angles whether you want to read, type, take notes, draw, or use external keyboards with laptops and tablets. The X-Kit provides optimal comfort without the fatigue of your neck, arms, wrists, or eyes. Less Phubbing, More ComfortAny idea how long you spend sitting?An average person sits for about 10 hours a day.Occupy 60% of waking hours.30 years of a fleeting life. Enjoy a high-quality display with the X-Kit’s ultra-high-definition HDMI port with 3D support—no image tearing, stuttering, or jerkiness, as well as fine audio and display synchronization.  Work Pro, Play CoolPresent your proud project and presentations, or share your favorite movies in exceptional quality with low latency. Use it at home, at conferences, or even during outdoor activities 1.  Transferring a 1GB movie in 5 seconds? Copying images from a 32GB memory card in 5 minutes? With the high-speed transmission of up to 5Gbps from the two USB-A 3.0 ports and 104 MB/s from the SD/TF card slots, the X-Kit nailed it.Open and fold-up in a split second; you can set up your office space anytime, anywhere with the X-Kit.  It fits easily in your backpack, tote bag, or even a briefcase.  Empowered by optimal design and materials, no more worries about the overheating issue of your USB hub.   Superheat DissipationThe lab temperature rise test shows that after 2 hours of full-load working, the maximum product surface temperature is about 41.9℃ (107.42℉) and 10℃ (50℉) lower than the average hubs on the market 2 .  Multi-Safety Protection The built-in short-circuit and over-current protection keeps your devices safe. Durable Companion By going through thousands of plug tests for all ports, and temperature tests from cold to hot procedures, the X-Kit will be your ultra-reliable and durable companion in various environments.   Highlight DetailsThe X-Kit perfectly supports all your USB-C based devices, from the latest MacBook lineup and iPads to all the flagship Android and Windows-based tablets. For size compatibility, it fits all laptops from 11”-17” in size 3.  Driving productivity to the fullest, the X-Kit is far more than just your average laptop stand or a simple USB-C hub. It is a combination of work, health, and creativity in life.  With our minimalist X-shaped structure consisting of double triangles, your laptop can breathe freely while staying stable at work.  The skeleton made of premium aircraft-grade aluminum alloy is 65% lighter yet 25% harder than the average, lightweight, and stable. Less, but more.  The silky-touch sandblasting-oxidation processed surface, slip, and crush-proof silicone bands gently embrace the practical aesthetics that flows in our veins.   Redefine your space for an efficient and healthy working environment, whether it’s at home, at a cafe, or the outdoors, basically, anywhere you go. From the product materials to its packaging, the X-Kit is fully recyclable with RoHS compliance. Additionally, it saves energy by lowering power consumption than a 1W LED lamp with a working HDMI port (≈333mA).  Expect 11 hours of playtime on a MacBook with keyboard and mouse set connected; 17% longer than an average USB hub.Thanks to the smart combination of materials, the X-Kit applies leading aircraft-grade 6063 T5 aluminum alloy + PC/ABS materials.  Weighing only 0.62lb (9.98oz), the X-Kit comes 2 ounces lighter than a Starbucks tall, the smallest Starbucks coffee on the regular menu.Say goodbye to insufficient ports, office syndrome, unstable connections, messy home office set up...  And work different with the UGREEN X-Kit from now on!

Made of 34 individual components, most of which are CNC-machined to precision in 316L stainless steel and aircraft grade aluminium.
Four retracting legs operated by simply twisting the body of the pen – allowing for a soft landing on your desk.
A magnetic Crew Cabin Capsule slides off to reveal a Black Mother of Pearl end cap. Should you wish, this end cap can be engraved with your own Monogram for a small fee (refer to Personalisation section below).
A Schmidt P950M Medium Black pressurised refill was carefully selected for its very smooth ink flow and easy writing experience at any angle.

</div></div>","We believe that in a world filled with distractions, all of us find it increasingly difficult to focus on the things and the people that really matter. We miss out on the most critical tasks that lay the foundations of our future. We fail to stay in touch with family and friends, and we forget to allocate time to our life-long desires and passions.
Don’t let your pursuit of success come in the way of your happiness.
We built the Elevate Planner from the ground up to provide you with the tools employed by the most successful people. It will help you visualize and define your goals, enhance your productivity through effective organization, live a well-rounded and balanced life, improve your health, and develop deeper relationships.
 

UPDATE: Perforated Pages have been removed in the final production due to failure rate based on pre-shipment sample user feedback.


 



Writing helps you to better articulate your goals, and to build a sense of accountability towards yourself. Writing and journaling also help you cut through the clutter and give you clarity.
With the ubiquity of connected devices, the idea of journaling and taking notes by hand may feel slow and regressive. However, there are various studies that have proven the benefits of putting pen to paper.

<p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>What is a digital tale?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">Any kind of interactive digital experience that integrates videos, photos, images, sound and text and that includes animations and user interactions.</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>Why is talely different?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">Talely has 5 main components and is the only solution that truly enables the creation, publication, hosting, sharing and display of these digital tales without any technical skill from the user.  And not only that, we really think that we all can create an amazing tale repository where all the stories that are relevant in the world can be stored and shared, so we can ultimately build a knowledge hub. We want to democratize digital engagement! </div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>Do I need programming skills to create and publish tales using talely?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">Our goal is that anyone can create and communicate their ideas in the most engaging digital way.  At this moment, this would take a team of designers, developers and a technical infrastructure that cost a lot of money and takes a long time to achieve.  This is why we created our ecosystem that eliminates all these barriers.</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>Can I create and publish all the tales that I want?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">Yes, there will be no limits to the number of tales you can create with talely.</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>Can I use any browser to work on talely?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">Our tales can be seen in all HTML5 browsers and for creating your tales, since our editor uses the most advanced capabilities available, we highly recommend using the latest versions of Chrome or Firefox.</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>How long does it take to learn how to use the platform?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">If you have used presentation tools in the past, learning our platform will take no more than one hour.  We have seen cases where users are proficient almost immediately.  Once you know how to use it, you can fully exploit itâ€™s potential and become a talely master in a couple of days.</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>Can I say goodbye to Powerpoint, Keynotes or Prezi?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">Hey, we love and also use those tools! We think every tool is unique and depends on what are you using it for, so please don't erase them from your computer.  In the case of talely, we are not only specialized in presentations and we think you can make most of the things you do with these tools and much more with the benefits that tales are web-based and that they can be viewed immediately by almost any device without the need of downloading software.</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>Will you have premium accounts?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">Well, who doesn’t! Joking aside, we think that eventually we will have premium accounts that will be specifically for users or companies that will profit from the use of talely.  What we won’t do is “water down” the free version... you will always be able to create the best possible tales.  And also, if you get one of our perks, you will always be premium to us!</div>
<br/><h2 style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 1.5em; color: #6C737A; font-weight: 100; text-align: center;"">OUR COMPONENTS</h2>
<p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>What is a block?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">Blocks are the basic building elements of our tales and the user can place them in the tale’s page and can easily configure its functionality without any programming.  Some examples are: video, audio, text, images and iframes blocks, which by the way, we have already developed.</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>Will I be able to create new blocks and will you provide tools?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">Yes, because we know there are millions of incredible developers in the world and we want them to help us evolve the platform for the benefit of all our users.  We are finishing an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that, with a very simple interface, will greatly simplify the creation of new blocks and functionalities.</div>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">We will also publish our API, so that the integration with other systems and new technologies will be possible and seamless.</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>What is a template?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">A template is a wizard that helps users create new tales step by step and can be categorized into all kinds of themes (e.g., trips, hobbies, projects, social causes, resumes, etc.).  They contain the narrative, structure and art needed to help users create engaging tales.  Once we finish this development, anyone will be able to create new templates and offer them to the community.  Right now you can create a tale and duplicate it as many times you need so you can use it as a template.</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>What is an editor plugin?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">When we designed the editor, we knew it had to be easy to extend in functionality so we developed it to be completely modular.  For example, the alignment tools you use in our editor to align your blocks is a simple plugin.  The plugin documentation will be open so you can create your own and help evolve the platform and even connect it with any service you like (e.g., developers will be able to create a plugin that connects to their favorite image hosting service, expanding the functionalities of the current media manager).</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>Can I design something in another tool (let’s say Adobe Illustrator) and export it directly?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">Yes, you will eventually be able to paste the clipboard into our editor and right now we are working in the current technological limitations because it doesn't work all the time as expected.  Until we finish this process you need to export your images and import them to our tool from your file system or drag and drop them directly into the editor canvas.</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>Can I save a tale as pdf?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">Because our tool allows you to create animated and interactive tales, saving them as a PDF is probably not the best way to deliver them, so it hasn’t been a priority.  But hey, nothing is impossible, so if this is a MUST please let us know and we will see what we can do.</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>Can I have a branded company channel?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">This is definitely a feature in our roadmap, so YES, you will be able to have a branded channel.  Until now, we have not focused in developing this but if you want to change this status, there's the Game Changer perk that will enable us to finish it when we launch in February 2014!</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>You mention a “marketplace”, how is it going to work?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">In this marketplace, storytellers, creatives and developers will be able to sell their work (tales, templates and blocks) within our platform.  We have not yet defined in detail the economics of how this will work but it will be very similar to current 'app' stores.</div>
<br/><p style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;""><b>Can I work with others at the same time while creating a story?</b></p>
<div style=""background: #ffffff; padding: 10px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: #555555;"">Right now you can but it’s a bit tricky since you have to work in different pages.

Our hub, which we are creating as we write this, is being developed using tools like can.js, brunch, stylus and handlebars, having initially used steal and jquerymx for the editor and player.

We want our ecosystem to be self sustainable for our users, so we designed a marketplace where storytellers, developers and creatives will be able to present their  tales, functionality blocks and templates and decide if they want to charge for their creations or allow talers to use them for free.
This will also promote a continuous evolution of talely so that everyone is assured of the future of the platform.




FAQ Menu


THE BASICS
What is a digital tale?
Any kind of interactive digital experience that integrates videos, photos, images, sound and text and that includes animations and user interactions.
Why is talely different?
Talely has 5 main components and is the only solution that truly enables the creation, publication, hosting, sharing and display of these digital tales without any technical skill from the user.  And not only that, we really think that we all can create an amazing tale repository where all the stories that are relevant in the world can be stored and shared, so we can ultimately build a knowledge hub. We want to democratize digital engagement! 
Do I need programming skills to create and publish tales using talely?
Our goal is that anyone can create and communicate their ideas in the most engaging digital way.  At this moment, this would take a team of designers, developers and a technical infrastructure that cost a lot of money and takes a long time to achieve.  This is why we created our ecosystem that eliminates all these barriers.
Can I create and publish all the tales that I want?
Yes, there will be no limits to the number of tales you can create with talely.
Can I use any browser to work on talely?
Our tales can be seen in all HTML5 browsers and for creating your tales, since our editor uses the most advanced capabilities available, we highly recommend using the latest versions of Chrome or Firefox.
How long does it take to learn how to use the platform?
If you have used presentation tools in the past, learning our platform will take no more than one hour.  We have seen cases where users are proficient almost immediately.  Once you know how to use it, you can fully exploit itâ€™s potential and become a talely master in a couple of days.
Can I say goodbye to Powerpoint, Keynotes or Prezi?
Hey, we love and also use those tools! We think every tool is unique and depends on what are you using it for, so please don't erase them from your computer.  In the case of talely, we are not only specialized in presentations and we think you can make most of the things you do with these tools and much more with the benefits that tales are web-based and that they can be viewed immediately by almost any device without the need of downloading software.
Will you have premium accounts?
Well, who doesn’t! Joking aside, we think that eventually we will have premium accounts that will be specifically for users or companies that will profit from the use of talely.  What we won’t do is “water down” the free version... you will always be able to create the best possible tales.  And also, if you get one of our perks, you will always be premium to us!
OUR COMPONENTS
What is a block?
Blocks are the basic building elements of our tales and the user can place them in the tale’s page and can easily configure its functionality without any programming.  Some examples are: video, audio, text, images and iframes blocks, which by the way, we have already developed.
Will I be able to create new blocks and will you provide tools?
Yes, because we know there are millions of incredible developers in the world and we want them to help us evolve the platform for the benefit of all our users.  We are finishing an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that, with a very simple interface, will greatly simplify the creation of new blocks and functionalities.
We will also publish our API, so that the integration with other systems and new technologies will be possible and seamless.
What is a template?
A template is a wizard that helps users create new tales step by step and can be categorized into all kinds of themes (e.g., trips, hobbies, projects, social causes, resumes, etc.).  They contain the narrative, structure and art needed to help users create engaging tales.  Once we finish this development, anyone will be able to create new templates and offer them to the community.  Right now you can create a tale and duplicate it as many times you need so you can use it as a template.
What is an editor plugin?
When we designed the editor, we knew it had to be easy to extend in functionality so we developed it to be completely modular.  For example, the alignment tools you use in our editor to align your blocks is a simple plugin.  The plugin documentation will be open so you can create your own and help evolve the platform and even connect it with any service you like (e.g., developers will be able to create a plugin that connects to their favorite image hosting service, expanding the functionalities of the current media manager).
Can I design something in another tool (let’s say Adobe Illustrator) and export it directly?
Yes, you will eventually be able to paste the clipboard into our editor and right now we are working in the current technological limitations because it doesn't work all the time as expected.  Until we finish this process you need to export your images and import them to our tool from your file system or drag and drop them directly into the editor canvas.
Can I save a tale as pdf?
Because our tool allows you to create animated and interactive tales, saving them as a PDF is probably not the best way to deliver them, so it hasn’t been a priority.  But hey, nothing is impossible, so if this is a MUST please let us know and we will see what we can do.
Can I have a branded company channel?
This is definitely a feature in our roadmap, so YES, you will be able to have a branded channel.  Until now, we have not focused in developing this but if you want to change this status, there's the Game Changer perk that will enable us to finish it when we launch in February 2014!
You mention a “marketplace”, how is it going to work?
In this marketplace, storytellers, creatives and developers will be able to sell their work (tales, templates and blocks) within our platform.  We have not yet defined in detail the economics of how this will work but it will be very similar to current 'app' stores.
Can I work with others at the same time while creating a story?
Right now you can but it’s a bit tricky since you have to work in different pages.  We do have an alpha version of this feature and when it’s finished, you'll be able to fully collaborate LIVE and efficiently while creating a story.
OUR TECHNOLOGY
What technology is behind talely?
We love new technologies, so everything we do is based on the latest and most efficient stuff out there (of course using stable versions!). Our infrastructures is almost entirely designed and implemented over Amazon AWS except for some backup, development and deployment tools that we use inside our offices. Our backend mostly uses node.js, redis, mongodb and memcache and it is designed to be completely scalable.  As for the frontend, we heavily use coffescript almost in every bit of our product.  Our hub, which we are creating as we write this, is being developed using tools like can.js, brunch, stylus and handlebars, having initially used steal and jquerymx for the editor and player.  So, we are always choosing the most efficient technologies after a careful assessment and risk analysis. Even when we are already using something, it may be replaced by something better the next time we can!
Does the platform allow the editing of pictures and videos?
Our image block is connected to a great service called aviary (http://www.aviary.com) that allows the editing of pictures.  Our video block is not currently connected to any service of this kind so if you know a good one, please share it with us and we will integrate it with our platform.
How do I know that my stories will be always available?
We take very seriously the availability of the tales published in our platform and we have taken extreme measures to assure it.  Every tale you publish is literally an optimized copy of the original and it’s hosted in one of the most powerful and widely available Content Delivery Network, or CDN.  This CDN brings 2 great benefits:
			
It replicates the tale all over the world so that it will be available in a server near the user that wants to view it, eliminating the latency and assuring the fastest possible delivery speed.
It guarantees that your tale will be available no matter how much traffic it receives.


Could I develop a game with the developer tools in talely?
Yes, in fact, we planned our ecosystem to be able to grow into whatever you might think (well, not really everything... but it can certainly do a lot of things!).
ABOUT TALELY
After launching talely, how much will it cost to use it?
Nothing, that's why we need the funds so we can make talely available for free.  In the future we are planning on charging certain functionalities that will enable our users to make profit using the platform.  So, as long as you use talely for your tales and non-profit activities, we won't charge a dime!
How do I know the development status of talely?
Right now we have an alpha version of the tale editor and hub.  As soon as this campaign ends, we will publish a roadmap with the status of how the things you helped us to develop are going.  Also, if you contributed as an early bird taler, you will have early access to the editor and you will be a witness of the progress as you use the tool because we have a very active schedule for releasing new functionalities and bug fixes (usually a week or two).
How many people work in talely?
A team of 10 totally committed (and a bit crazy) talers, from all kind of different backgrounds: developers, designers, creatives, consultants and more...
How have you funded the development of talely?
We have funded the development until now from the profits of other projects and with the support and understanding of family and friends, investing everything we have into making talely a reality.
Can I go to your office and have a cup of coffee with all of you?
Sure, anytime!  But please bring a mug (we are short on those right now!).
Why are you asking for $50,000 dollars?
For two reasons, the first being that we still need to finish the platform and all 2013 we have focused exclusively in this development, declining any other projects that were not directly related to it.  On the other hand, one of the main threats to a startup such as ours is success, so if we do get a lot of users, we need funds to pay for servers, and they don't come cheap!

It lives on top of a 3D printer or CNC mill, and does not get in the way of using the tool normally -- you can switch from laser to printer mode and vice versa in less than two minutes with no tools.

is hosted with emphasis on privacy, security, access control, and encryption. Your data

                        media@thedatasafe.ch</a> (EN-FR)<br/></p><b>Why the need for an optimal secured storage service?

</b><p>“The need for THEDATASAFE.ch has been inspired by my clients
and the recent sensitive issues around data storage and sharing I saw emerging
with widely used cloud services.” Olivier Cochard, founder of THEDATASAFE.ch.</p>
<p>At THEDATASAFE.ch, we
are concerned about the privacy and safety of our clients’ data, generated by
their personal and professional life. Data is often essential to the running of
your activities and shall be treated as an extremely precious asset.  Currently, widely used cloud solutions such
as DropBoxTM , BoxTM or GoogleDriveTM, rely on US based servers with all the legal implications that
make the headlines. Those solutions induce uncontrolled access to data,
sometime resulting in unsolicited advertisement, and potentially invisible surveillance.
</p>
<p>The key dilemma for end-users is the following: “My
data shall belong to my person or my company, and therefore shall be completely
secured even when I share it. Between my holiday pictures, customers contact
details, or company’s contracts, those data must be only accessible to the sole
people I choose to share it with, and not within a system I have no control
over. On the technical aspect, I expect an easy and simple access to data at
anytime, from anywhere, and on any device.” </p>
<p>To answer this need, we
have designed state of the art services that provides ”drop box
like"""", end-to-end encryption, synchronization and sharing
capabilities without compromising the confidentiality and security of data. Our
goal is to offer an optimal data safe like a safe in a private bank! Data is encrypted physically on
the servers. Even administrators at THEDATASAFE.ch can’t access clients' data content. </p><b>FEATURES</b><br/>Swiss based<ul><li>Swiss data privacy protection.</li></ul>Zero access<ul><li>For you eyes only. </li></ul>Easy to use <ul><li>Sync and Share. </li></ul>Anywhere, anytime<ul><li>Your data whenever you want.</li></ul>Cross Platform<ul><li>With desktop and mobile apps.</li></ul>Manage your team <ul><li>Collaborate and share securely.</li></ul><b>Why do we need funding of USD 145’000?</b><br/>In order to bring this service to anyone seeking Internet
     privacy, we need to finance the first 18 months of our business plan for our Stage 2 infrastructure. More importantlsy, we are doing this campaign on Indiegogo in order to stay independent.<p>Those funds are split between:</p><p>- The one off investment costs for the Stage 2 servers and redundant storage, including their
setup;</p>
<p>- The hosting, the development, the manpower, and the marketing;
and</p><p></p><p>- The costs to build the prototype of THEDATASAFE.ch Appliance;
and</p>- The costs for the licenses of the different components of our solution<br/><b><b><br/>What do we offer contributors?</b><br/></b>
<p><span><span></span></span>Our Beta service is going very well and
has become the template for our Stage 2 environment. Your contribution will enable us to bring data privacy
to more people and companies more rapidly. 
<br/></p><p>As contributors, you have a chance to use our services now, in <b>Beta</b>, you will find perks that will give you access to the few slots
available including free migration to the new environment when it becomes
available. </p>
<p>Otherwise, if you can wait, you can
directly reserve your slot on the <b>Stage 2</b> environment and your contribution will help us reach that goal

secured even when I share it. Between my holiday pictures, customers contact
details, or company’s contracts, those data must be only accessible to the sole
people I choose to share it with, and not within a system I have no control
over. On the technical aspect, I expect an easy and simple access to data at
anytime, from anywhere, and on any device.” 
To answer this need, we
have designed state of the art services that provides ”drop box
like"""", end-to-end encryption, synchronization and sharing
capabilities without compromising the confidentiality and security of data. Our
goal is to offer an optimal data safe like a safe in a private bank! Data is encrypted physically on
the servers. Even administrators at THEDATASAFE.ch can’t access clients' data content. FEATURESSwiss basedSwiss data privacy protection.Zero accessFor you eyes only. Easy to use Sync and Share. Anywhere, anytimeYour data whenever you want.Cross PlatformWith desktop and mobile apps.Manage your team Collaborate and share securely.Why do we need funding of USD 145’000?In order to bring this service to anyone seeking Internet
     privacy, we need to finance the first 18 months of our business plan for our Stage 2 infrastructure. More importantlsy, we are doing this campaign on Indiegogo in order to stay independent.Those funds are split between:- The one off investment costs for the Stage 2 servers and redundant storage, including their
setup;
- The hosting, the development, the manpower, and the marketing;
and- The costs to build the prototype of THEDATASAFE.ch Appliance;
and- The costs for the licenses of the different components of our solutionWhat do we offer contributors?
Our Beta service is going very well and
has become the template for our Stage 2 environment. Your contribution will enable us to bring data privacy
to more people and companies more rapidly. 
As contributors, you have a chance to use our services now, in Beta, you will find perks that will give you access to the few slots
available including free migration to the new environment when it becomes
available. 
Otherwise, if you can wait, you can
directly reserve your slot on the Stage 2 environment and your contribution will help us reach that goal
sooner.

<p>After Hurricane María hit in 2017, my hometown of Puerto Rico was devastated. As you can imagine, humans were not the only ones that felt the wrath. Animal homelessness, an already huge problem, was exacerbated and magnified. Animal sanctuaries across the island lost their abilities to provide shelter and thousands were left on the street. I remember running errands one afternoon and having to swerve around three dead bodies thinking: ""someone has to DO something about this"", only to realize I was someone.</p>
<p>So in the middle of the night in complete darkness (Puerto Rico remained without power for more than a year), I lit a candle, whipped out a pen and a pad and started coming up with ideas on how to put an end to this epidemic. I landed on an app and called it Petmosphere. My main goal is and always will be to take these animals off the street and provide homes by educating the masses on how to properly care for these creatures; psychology is at the root of this problem not just here in my backyard but around the world.</p>
<p>I'd like to take this opportunity and let you know the idea that started it all. Let's say you're walking down the street and stumble across a cat or dog that seems friendly, doesn't have a collar and is in some sort of need. You whip out the app and snap a picture. Using the GPS on your phone, you'll upload him/her while describing them to the best of your abilities. Once you hit ""post"", that'll generate a notification to all the rescuers, volunteers, foster parents and shelters around an established perimeter so that they can take immediate action and assist in getting that animal out of harm's way.</p>
<p>Since then, my main focus has been to provide animal shelters with tools that they'll  need to operate more efficiently and effectively. We've added the Carousel, a matchmaking adoption platform that allows you to browse hundreds of potential pets looking for forever homes. We've eased the adoption process itself so that a right swipe will privately contact the shelter and initiate a possible interview and visit; sanctuaries will also be notified of all interest through an internal notification as well as be accompanied by an email.</p>
<p>Although doing away with animal homelessness will forever be the goal, we're now thinking bigger and aim to become your go-to app for everything pet related. We established a timeline on which to share your most creative pet pictures, the most popular of which gets rewarded at the end of every month for content creation purposes. In addition, we're constantly working behind the scenes to:</p>
<p>Make Petmosphere multilingual so that more and more people can use it worldwide.</p>
<p>Work alongside local authorities to report abuse and negligence on the spot.</p>
<p>Incorporate the ability to post videos for further engagement.</p>
<p>Establish a recurrent donation plan for shelters.</p>
<p>Help pet business owners operate conveniently through our app.</p>
<p>Set up an online store whose proceeds go to helping animal shelters thrive.</p>
<p>Our latest update includes some key features, an active website and the ability to download our app internationally. Check out our trailers &amp; download the app!  We have outlined more than 25 potential releases that will make the Petmosphere truly unique but we can't do it alone. We need your help to make that happen.</p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>We're aware we are up against major players in the industry and, although it may seem as though we're trying to reinvent the wheel in this market, we have a plan of action the likes of which nobody seems to be doing. It has been outlined and is detail oriented. Right now our main concern is the speed with which we bring Petmosphere to its maximum glory; manpower is required since we're currently two people working on the app.</p>

<h3>UnBias AI for Decision Makers</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""Quite frankly this is the best bit of communication in this area I have ever seen.<br/>It is the perfect complement to the UnBias Fairness Toolkit. Together they can be adopted by any organisation in business, charity, education, healthcare etc etc.<br/>Especially in the light of recent events I just wish that every member of the Government and the Civil Service had a set! <br/>I know how difficult it is to refine the language so that it really gets through. You have done a superb job.""</i></p>

<p>AI4DM is a suite of <strong>critical thinking</strong> tools enabling cross-organisational stakeholders to implement transdisciplinary ethical and governance assessments of planned or existing AI and automated decision-making systems.<br/>It naturally fosters <strong>participation</strong>, bringing people together to map AI systems, existing and proposed, against the organisation's own mission, vision, values and ethics.<br/>It uses a <strong>whole</strong> <strong>systems</strong> approach to analyse organisational structures and operations, illuminating to participants the breadth of issues beyond their individual responsibilities.</p>

<p>The tools are intuitive, practical and can be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>revealing where and how a system is either in <strong>alignment</strong>, and where it is (or could be) <i>misaligned</i> with the organisation's mission, vision, values and ethics;</li>
<li>enabling different stakeholders to appreciate where and how their <strong>obligations</strong> and <strong>responsibilities</strong> intersect with those of others. </li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><a href=""http://proboscis.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Proboscis</a> is fundraising to manufacture a print-run of at least 500 copies of the AI4DM Toolkit (card deck and handbook). This economy of scale will make the toolkit <strong>affordable</strong> for many (and much cheaper than ordering the deck only from our <a href=""https://www.makeplayingcards.com/sell/marketplace/unbias-ai-for-decision-makers.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">existing print-on-demand option</a>). Included in the perk will be professionally printed copies of the handbook.</p>
<p>We are also offering the original <strong>UnBias Fairness Toolkit</strong> as a perk, including professionally printed copies of both its own Handbook and the Facilitator Booklet. This toolkit is designed to build awareness in young people and other non-experts of what algorithmic bias is and how it may be affecting them and their communities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are offering a <strong>Facilitation Training Package </strong>of one-to-one online video training sessions with <a href=""https://gileslane.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Giles Lane</a>, the creator/designer of both the UnBias Fairness and the AI4DM Toolkits. Two sessions each to plan and evaluate using the AI4DM toolkit, as well as to advise on combining it with the Fairness toolkit. A personalised ""AI4DM Facilitator's Guide"" will <i>only</i> be available to backers of this perk.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598704366/idcacwglvool2qtjsbz7.png"" src=""""/><br/><a href=""https://bookleteer.com/book.html?id=3498#page/1/mode/2up"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read the AI4DM Handbook online</a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Test the Toolkit Now</h3>
<p>The AI4DM and UnBias Fairness toolkits are already available in <a href=""http://proboscis.org.uk/unbias"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">free DIY downloadable versions</a> for you to print at home using standard office stationery. </p>
<p>In 2018/19 over 650 manufactured sets of the Fairness toolkit were printed and distributed – these have been used extensively in education and community settings and widely praised.  By raising funds to manufacture a similar number of the AI4DM toolkit we hope to deliver a similar pragmatic and practical impact on the increasing use of AI and automated decision making systems – giving both public and private organisations an immediately useful framework.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The toolkits and additional materials (handbooks and facilitator's guides etc) are all production-ready: DIY print-at-home versions are <a href=""http://proboscis.org.uk/unbias"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">already available</a> for those who wish to try them out.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we will use the funds collected to print as many card sets as we can afford. The Handbooks will remain accessible as online and downloadable versions on <a href=""http://bookleteer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bookleteer.com</a> (Proboscis' unique self-publishing platform). Backers of the training perk will also receive their sessions.</p>
<p>Our key risk is not reaching our goal to achieve the economy of scale that a run of 500 will bring. Given the previous success of (and continuing demand for) the manufactured version of the UnBias Fairness Toolkit, we are confident that enough demand will emerge for the AI4DM toolkit.</p>
<p>Conversely, should the campaign be more successful than anticipated, we will face a challenge in delivering a larger number of perks within the timeframe (we are a very small team working from home), however we will endeavour to fulfil all perks as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p><a href=""http://proboscis.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Proboscis</a> is a non-profit, artist-led creative studio based in London, UK since 1994. We have created multiple pioneering and ground-breaking projects that fuse social and cultural issues with emerging and traditional technologies. Our collaborations with research partners span many universities in the UK and abroad, and we also work closely with grassroots communities, industry, civil society and public sector organisations.</p>
<p>In 2018 we launched the <a href=""http://proboscis.org.uk/5970/unbias-fairness-toolkit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UnBias Fairness Toolkit</a> to promote awareness of bias, trust and fairness in algorithmic and automated decision making systems.

""Quite frankly this is the best bit of communication in this area I have ever seen.It is the perfect complement to the UnBias Fairness Toolkit. Together they can be adopted by any organisation in business, charity, education, healthcare etc etc.Especially in the light of recent events I just wish that every member of the Government and the Civil Service had a set! I know how difficult it is to refine the language so that it really gets through. You have done a superb job.""
Lord Clement-Jones CBEChair of the House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (2017–2018)
AI4DM is a suite of critical thinking tools enabling cross-organisational stakeholders to implement transdisciplinary ethical and governance assessments of planned or existing AI and automated decision-making systems.It naturally fosters participation, bringing people together to map AI systems, existing and proposed, against the organisation's own mission, vision, values and ethics.It uses a whole systems approach to analyse organisational structures and operations, illuminating to participants the breadth of issues beyond their individual responsibilities.

The tools are intuitive, practical and can be used for:

revealing where and how a system is either in alignment, and where it is (or could be) misaligned with the organisation's mission, vision, values and ethics;
enabling different stakeholders to appreciate where and how their obligations and responsibilities intersect with those of others. 
emphasising the collective nature of lawful and ethical responsibilities across the whole organisation
providing a mechanism for a deep analysis of complex challenges.

Watch our Animations on using the toolkit
 

What We Need & What You Get
Proboscis is fundraising to manufacture a print-run of at least 500 copies of the AI4DM Toolkit (card deck and handbook). This economy of scale will make the toolkit affordable for many (and much cheaper than ordering the deck only from our existing print-on-demand option). Included in the perk will be professionally printed copies of the handbook.
We are also offering the original UnBias Fairness Toolkit as a perk, including professionally printed copies of both its own Handbook and the Facilitator Booklet. This toolkit is designed to build awareness in young people and other non-experts of what algorithmic bias is and how it may be affecting them and their communities.
Furthermore, we are offering a Facilitation Training Package of one-to-one online video training sessions with Giles Lane, the creator/designer of both the UnBias Fairness and the AI4DM Toolkits. Two sessions each to plan and evaluate using the AI4DM toolkit, as well as to advise on combining it with the Fairness toolkit. A personalised ""AI4DM Facilitator's Guide"" will only be available to backers of this perk.
Read the AI4DM Handbook online
 

Test the Toolkit Now
The AI4DM and UnBias Fairness toolkits are already available in free DIY downloadable versions for you to print at home using standard office stationery. 
In 2018/19 over 650 manufactured sets of the Fairness toolkit were printed and distributed – these have been used extensively in education and community settings and widely praised.  By raising funds to manufacture a similar number of the AI4DM toolkit we hope to deliver a similar pragmatic and practical impact on the increasing use of AI and automated decision making systems – giving both public and private organisations an immediately useful framework.
 
 

Risks & Challenges
The toolkits and additional materials (handbooks and facilitator's guides etc) are all production-ready: DIY print-at-home versions are already available for those who wish to try them out.
If we do not reach our goal, we will use the funds collected to print as many card sets as we can afford. The Handbooks will remain accessible as online and downloadable versions on bookleteer.com (Proboscis' unique self-publishing platform). Backers of the training perk will also receive their sessions.
Our key risk is not reaching our goal to achieve the economy of scale that a run of 500 will bring. Given the previous success of (and continuing demand for) the manufactured version of the UnBias Fairness Toolkit, we are confident that enough demand will emerge for the AI4DM toolkit.
Conversely, should the campaign be more successful than anticipated, we will face a challenge in delivering a larger number of perks within the timeframe (we are a very small team working from home), however we will endeavour to fulfil all perks as quickly as possible.
 
About Us
Proboscis is a non-profit, artist-led creative studio based in London, UK since 1994. We have created multiple pioneering and ground-breaking projects that fuse social and cultural issues with emerging and traditional technologies. Our collaborations with research partners span many universities in the UK and abroad, and we also work closely with grassroots communities, industry, civil society and public sector organisations.
In 2018 we launched the UnBias Fairness Toolkit to promote awareness of bias, trust and fairness in algorithmic and automated decision making systems. It was designed for non-experts (i.e. the general public) to get to grips with the nature of bias and how it may affect them. It was part of the larger UnBias research project funded by the EPSRC and led by the Horizon Institute at the University of Nottingham with the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh and Proboscis.
In 2020 we were invited by Ansgar Koene (a Senior Research Fellow at Horizon and Global AI Ethics and Regulation Lead for EY Global Services) to develop a companion toolkit on ethics and governance for those in public and private organisations who are planning, developing, designing, deploying or evaluating Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning systems for automated decision making.

<h3>Why we're on Indiegogo:</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Robb Moore, the founder and inventor of ioSafe. We make fireproof and waterproof data storage devices - like an aircraft black box but for your vital data.</p>
<p>We're releasing the first disaster proof private cloud in January 2013. This product will allow anyone to create, secure, access and protect their vital data on their own private cloud. It's fireproof, waterproof and bolts to the floor. It'll store terabytes of data that you'll be able to access quickly from home but is still easily accessible when you're not. Any smartphone, tablet, PC, Mac or Linux device can access and share pictures, files, videos and music.  </p>
<p>If you surf around the internet, you'll see ioSafe products everywhere - both in the news and for sale. You might think we don't need Indiegogo but we do.</p>
<p>We've developed awesome technology that combines computers with safes. We do outrageous demos to get attention. We build hard-core storage products and protect our customers with unprecedented support.  Despite all our successes, the fact of the matter is we’re a small 20-person company up against billion-dollar competitors – we’re a modern-day “David versus Goliath.”</p>
<p>We've been growing quickly over the last four years which is, for the most part, fantastic. The downside is that growth can be painful if you're paying for next month's growth with sales from 4 months ago while doubling every year.</p>
<p>We need the help from our community to take ioSafe to the next level. We're very excited to introduce the ioSafe N2 to you - it's our greatest work to date.</p>
<p>The ioSafe N2 that you see in the video is a real, working prototype. We need your support to show us that you're as excited as we are about this project. It can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring a product to market but we need the signal from our fans to let us know there's a real need.</p>
<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;  UPDATE 9/20  &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</p>
<p>Interest for this product outside of Indiegogo is growing fast. This is project is happening regardless of the amount raised. The rewards here at Indiegogo are the best deals going for all our early adopters and fans. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</p>
<p>Your contribution will help fund:</p>
<p>- High volume production tooling <br/>- Large component orders<br/>- Emissions and testing certification</p>
<p>The more we raise, the more you win. Our rewards are set up so you get automatic upgrades to either storage capacity or our Data Recovery Service/Warranty the more popular the campaign becomes. Please help us spread the word on your social networks!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>-Robb</p>

<h1><strong>It's all about you. Your data. Your stuff. All of it.</strong></h1>
<div class=""vimiumReset vimiumHUD"">
<strong>The ioSafe N2 is the first disaster-proof private cloud device of it's kind</strong>. Like an aircraft black box for your data, the N2 is designed to protect and secure terabytes of the most precious data on the planet - your data. </div>
<h1>The Cloud Problem: Slow, Pricy and Insecure</h1>
<p>If you have a 20-30 GB to protect, the public cloud is an option. If you have terabytes to store, the traditional public cloud breaks down quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Speed: </strong>Moving a terabyte online can take months. Three or four terabytes? Fuggedaboutit! Months to upload and months to download. It's faster to ship a hard drive across the country than to try to stream the data across the internet. The situation is only getting worse as data growth will continue to exceed bandwidth over the foreseeable future. It's the equivalent of pushing the Pacific Ocean through a garden hose.</p>
<p><strong>Cost: </strong>To store a couple of terabytes on Amazon's S3 Storage over three years will cost over $8000. Granted Mozy, Carbonite or Backblaze combined with Dropbox can be a fantastic setup if (1) you don't have terabytes of data and (2) you don't have them on a NAS and (3) you don't care about disaster recovery for all your programs or OS in addition to your data.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Security</strong>: </strong>No one in the public cloud cares as much about your data as you do. Information gets hacked, deleted and compromised in the public cloud as the biggest databases represent the juiciest targets for hackers. Staying in control of how your local data is stored, accessed and managed is an excellent way to avoid risks of the public cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Private Cloud: </strong>The private cloud (aka NAS with cloud-like applications: picture sharing, music streaming and file syncing) can help solve the speed and security issues associated with the public cloud. It's fast when you're local and accessible when you're remote. The security is set by you and only you: simply pull the plug out of the wall if you want to completely lock out all external access to your data. Once your data is out in the public cloud, you lose control over how or where your data is stored. It will invariably get replicated across the internet and can never be made completely secure again.</p>
<p><strong>Disaster Recovery (DR) for</strong><strong> the private cloud? </strong>Streaming your data offsite for disaster protection is slow and is fraught with unknown risks regarding your service provider's policies and employees. Trying to replicate onsite and then physically move the data offsite for DR is a daily hassle and expense. You risk losing the data through human error, an unlocked car, disgruntled employee, etc. - bad things happen. Streaming or syncing terabytes online leads straight back to the public cloud's cost and bandwidth issues.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> ioSafe protects from natural disaster by wrapping its patented protection technology around vulnerable private cloud data - onsite. You get fast local access, redundant hard drives, security, nearly unlimited storage, cloud convenience, access to the data with virtually any device and onsite protection against natural disasters. <strong>It's a beautiful thing - digital Nirvana.</strong></p>
<p>You can use our solution alone or in conjunction with your existing backup and DR practices if you have any already in place. Every situation is special and this technology is meant as a tool for you to use to reduce your vulnerability. There is simply no other another single solution available with all the advantages of the ioSafe N2 for speed, flexibility, cost and disaster recovery.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fire Protection</em></strong><br/>Protects data from loss up to 1550°F for 1/2 hour per ASTM E119<br/>DataCast endothermic fire insulation technology protects your data from extreme heat. The DataCast formulation forms a chemical bond with water molecules that, at temperatures above 160°F, releases water vapor to limit the internal temperature of the unit during a fire.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/148/305/b1c11a6f90516c2aea94c0c2e555fc2a_large.png?1346974636"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><em><strong>Water Protection</strong></em></p>
<p>Protects data from loss up to 10ft for 72 hours.<br/>HydroSafe water barrier technology is designed to protect data loss from fresh or salt water damage, including full immersion. While keeping your data dry, the HydroSafe technology still allows heat to dissipate during normal operation.</p>

<p><strong><em>Active Airflow Cooling</em></strong><br/>For optimum operating temperature, FloSafe active airflow cooling technology provides cooling airflow through the enclosure and across the disk drives during normal operating conditions. If destructive heat levels are sensed, such as in a fire, the FloSafe vent is designed to limit and protect your data from the extreme heat.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/148/306/1ca79504a459bff323e053ae9363632c_large.png?1346974729"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><em><strong>Theft Protection</strong></em></p>
<p>First - be creative. You can make this device a part of your wireless network and hide it anywhere inside your house or workplace. Hide it as you might a small safe. Additionally, a Kensington lock slot is standard. An Optional Floor Mount / Padlock Kit (shipping in January 2013) will enable the N2 to bolt down to any surface or be secured with a cable &amp; padlock. Securing the drive also prevents the drive from moving during a disaster.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/148/308/74f17e31e52104758ab6c581682a58d1_large.png?1346974925"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong><em>Data Recovery Service</em></strong><br/>The ultimate safety net for the ultimate NAS, the ioSafe Data Recovery Service (DRS) provides a multi-use, no questions asked data and hardware recovery service. For any loss, no matter the reason, ioSafe will ship, attempt recovery, spend up to $2500 per terabyte on forensic recovery if required and send data back on replacement product. First use of DRS has no deductible. DRS Pro is intended for our Pro-sumer and Business Users by covering the ioSafe device + the connected server or PC with limits up to $5000 per TB.

<h1><strong>How does it work?</strong></h1>
<p>The ioSafe N2 connects to your home or business network, preferable at the main router or switch. A network drive (or ""share"") can be created that allows everyone on the local area network (LAN) with proper permissions to ""see"" the common drive and share the data. The data can also be made available to the wide area network (WAN - aka the Internet) by allow applications and data to be ""forwarded"" to the NAS at your router.</p>

<h1><strong>FAQ</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Q. How does the N2 stay cool if it's surrounded by fireproof insulation?    A.</strong> ioSafe's patented FloSafe Vent technology allows cooling airflow to pass through the enclosure during normal operation. In a fire, steam is created in the internal cavity with flows outward from all vent holes - effectively creating a positive pressure room inside the device. The action of the outward flow of water vapor prohibits the hot fire energy from invading the drives held within. </p>
<p><strong>Q. The N2 has holes. How is it waterproof?    A. </strong>While the outer enclosure has holes, the hard drives on the inside are hermetically sealed in a heat conductive yet waterproof extrusion. Also known as our HydroSafe technology, heat generated from the drives is allowed to pass through the waterproof barrier and cooled off with the airflow. In a flood, the outer casing may get wet or even destroyed but the data stays safe on the drives as they never get wet.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Can the 512MB of RAM be upgraded?    A. </strong>No. The memory is not user serviceable.</p>
<p><strong>Q. How fast is the N2?    A.</strong> Using RAID 1, 108MB/s Read and 65MB/s write speeds are possible on a Windows environment.  (performance can vary in different environments)</p>

</div></div>","Why we're on Indiegogo:
Hi! I'm Robb Moore, the founder and inventor of ioSafe. We make fireproof and waterproof data storage devices - like an aircraft black box but for your vital data.
We're releasing the first disaster proof private cloud in January 2013. This product will allow anyone to create, secure, access and protect their vital data on their own private cloud. It's fireproof, waterproof and bolts to the floor. It'll store terabytes of data that you'll be able to access quickly from home but is still easily accessible when you're not. Any smartphone, tablet, PC, Mac or Linux device can access and share pictures, files, videos and music.  
If you surf around the internet, you'll see ioSafe products everywhere - both in the news and for sale. You might think we don't need Indiegogo but we do.
We've developed awesome technology that combines computers with safes. We do outrageous demos to get attention. We build hard-core storage products and protect our customers with unprecedented support.  Despite all our successes, the fact of the matter is we’re a small 20-person company up against billion-dollar competitors – we’re a modern-day “David versus Goliath.”
We've been growing quickly over the last four years which is, for the most part, fantastic. The downside is that growth can be painful if you're paying for next month's growth with sales from 4 months ago while doubling every year.
We need the help from our community to take ioSafe to the next level. We're very excited to introduce the ioSafe N2 to you - it's our greatest work to date.
The ioSafe N2 that you see in the video is a real, working prototype. We need your support to show us that you're as excited as we are about this project. It can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring a product to market but we need the signal from our fans to let us know there's a real need.
<><><><><>  UPDATE 9/20  <><><><><>
Interest for this product outside of Indiegogo is growing fast. This is project is happening regardless of the amount raised. The rewards here at Indiegogo are the best deals going for all our early adopters and fans. Thank you so much.
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Your contribution will help fund:
- High volume production tooling - Large component orders- Emissions and testing certification
The more we raise, the more you win. Our rewards are set up so you get automatic upgrades to either storage capacity or our Data Recovery Service/Warranty the more popular the campaign becomes. Please help us spread the word on your social networks!
Thanks!

ioSafe N2 : Disaster-Proof Private Cloud  - like an aircraft black box for personal or business data.

The ioSafe N2 is a fireproof and waterproof, network connected, multi-drive NAS/RAID storage device for terabytes of your precious personal or business data. 
Designed to be the center of your private cloud, the ioSafe N2 is powered by a Synology DSM motherboard and operating system. It allows for fast access on your local network and remote access from nearly any device connected to the internet - all secured and protected by you.

The ioSafe N2 is designed and assembled by ioSafe in California - a data storage company with a vision to protect the world's photos, videos and business data.
Press on the ioSafe N2:
Wired - ""I'm itching to get one"" 
CNET - ""Best of both worlds""
AnandTech - ""Exciting""
Small Business Trends - ""Gives businesses control of their data""
DVICE - ""Definitely worth a look""
 
It's all about you. Your data. Your stuff. All of it.

The ioSafe N2 is the first disaster-proof private cloud device of it's kind. Like an aircraft black box for your data, the N2 is designed to protect and secure terabytes of the most precious data on the planet - your data. 
The Cloud Problem: Slow, Pricy and Insecure
If you have a 20-30 GB to protect, the public cloud is an option. If you have terabytes to store, the traditional public cloud breaks down quickly.
Speed: Moving a terabyte online can take months. Three or four terabytes? Fuggedaboutit! Months to upload and months to download. It's faster to ship a hard drive across the country than to try to stream the data across the internet. The situation is only getting worse as data growth will continue to exceed bandwidth over the foreseeable future. It's the equivalent of pushing the Pacific Ocean through a garden hose.
Cost: To store a couple of terabytes on Amazon's S3 Storage over three years will cost over $8000. Granted Mozy, Carbonite or Backblaze combined with Dropbox can be a fantastic setup if (1) you don't have terabytes of data and (2) you don't have them on a NAS and (3) you don't care about disaster recovery for all your programs or OS in addition to your data.
Security: No one in the public cloud cares as much about your data as you do. Information gets hacked, deleted and compromised in the public cloud as the biggest databases represent the juiciest targets for hackers. Staying in control of how your local data is stored, accessed and managed is an excellent way to avoid risks of the public cloud.
Private Cloud: The private cloud (aka NAS with cloud-like applications: picture sharing, music streaming and file syncing) can help solve the speed and security issues associated with the public cloud. It's fast when you're local and accessible when you're remote. The security is set by you and only you: simply pull the plug out of the wall if you want to completely lock out all external access to your data. Once your data is out in the public cloud, you lose control over how or where your data is stored. It will invariably get replicated across the internet and can never be made completely secure again.
Disaster Recovery (DR) for the private cloud? Streaming your data offsite for disaster protection is slow and is fraught with unknown risks regarding your service provider's policies and employees. Trying to replicate onsite and then physically move the data offsite for DR is a daily hassle and expense. You risk losing the data through human error, an unlocked car, disgruntled employee, etc. - bad things happen. Streaming or syncing terabytes online leads straight back to the public cloud's cost and bandwidth issues.
Solution: ioSafe protects from natural disaster by wrapping its patented protection technology around vulnerable private cloud data - onsite. You get fast local access, redundant hard drives, security, nearly unlimited storage, cloud convenience, access to the data with virtually any device and onsite protection against natural disasters. It's a beautiful thing - digital Nirvana.
You can use our solution alone or in conjunction with your existing backup and DR practices if you have any already in place. Every situation is special and this technology is meant as a tool for you to use to reduce your vulnerability. There is simply no other another single solution available with all the advantages of the ioSafe N2 for speed, flexibility, cost and disaster recovery.
ioSafe Technology:

Fire ProtectionProtects data from loss up to 1550°F for 1/2 hour per ASTM E119DataCast endothermic fire insulation technology protects your data from extreme heat. The DataCast formulation forms a chemical bond with water molecules that, at temperatures above 160°F, releases water vapor to limit the internal temperature of the unit during a fire.

Water Protection
Protects data from loss up to 10ft for 72 hours.HydroSafe water barrier technology is designed to protect data loss from fresh or salt water damage, including full immersion. While keeping your data dry, the HydroSafe technology still allows heat to dissipate during normal operation.

Active Airflow CoolingFor optimum operating temperature, FloSafe active airflow cooling technology provides cooling airflow through the enclosure and across the disk drives during normal operating conditions. If destructive heat levels are sensed, such as in a fire, the FloSafe vent is designed to limit and protect your data from the extreme heat.

Theft Protection
First - be creative. You can make this device a part of your wireless network and hide it anywhere inside your house or workplace. Hide it as you might a small safe. Additionally, a Kensington lock slot is standard. An Optional Floor Mount / Padlock Kit (shipping in January 2013) will enable the N2 to bolt down to any surface or be secured with a cable & padlock. Securing the drive also prevents the drive from moving during a disaster.

Data Recovery ServiceThe ultimate safety net for the ultimate NAS, the ioSafe Data Recovery Service (DRS) provides a multi-use, no questions asked data and hardware recovery service. For any loss, no matter the reason, ioSafe will ship, attempt recovery, spend up to $2500 per terabyte on forensic recovery if required and send data back on replacement product. First use of DRS has no deductible. DRS Pro is intended for our Pro-sumer and Business Users by covering the ioSafe device + the connected server or PC with limits up to $5000 per TB. See our website for terms and conditions.

How does it work?
The ioSafe N2 connects to your home or business network, preferable at the main router or switch. A network drive (or ""share"") can be created that allows everyone on the local area network (LAN) with proper permissions to ""see"" the common drive and share the data. The data can also be made available to the wide area network (WAN - aka the Internet) by allow applications and data to be ""forwarded"" to the NAS at your router.
If you've never setup a network, get an experienced friend or call us - we're happy to help.

Combined with a quick-start widget, users can simultaneously tour the DSM operating system and set it up to use immediately.
Peace of Mind with Data Encryption
The ioSafe N2 is equipped with an encryption engine which offloads the encryption calculation task away from the main CPU, helping to improve file transfer speeds of the N2.
Data protection is an important matter for businesses of all sizes. High-end features previously available only on enterprise level hardware are now accessible via ioSafe N2 to small and medium-sized businesses. N2 provides share-level AES 256-bit encryption to aid in the prevention of unauthorized access attempts to the hard drives.
Energy Efficient with Cool and Quiet Design
ioSafe N2 is designed with energy efficiency in mind. Not only does it provide a 92x92 mm fan and the smart airflow to keep the system running cool 24/7, its noise dampening design makes it really quiet compared to PC counterparts. The support of Wake on LAN/WAN, multiple scheduled power on/off and hard drive hibernation can further reduce power consumption and operation cost.

FAQ
Q. How does the N2 stay cool if it's surrounded by fireproof insulation?    A. ioSafe's patented FloSafe Vent technology allows cooling airflow to pass through the enclosure during normal operation. In a fire, steam is created in the internal cavity with flows outward from all vent holes - effectively creating a positive pressure room inside the device. The action of the outward flow of water vapor prohibits the hot fire energy from invading the drives held within. 
Q. The N2 has holes. How is it waterproof?    A. While the outer enclosure has holes, the hard drives on the inside are hermetically sealed in a heat conductive yet waterproof extrusion. Also known as our HydroSafe technology, heat generated from the drives is allowed to pass through the waterproof barrier and cooled off with the airflow. In a flood, the outer casing may get wet or even destroyed but the data stays safe on the drives as they never get wet.
Q. Can the 512MB of RAM be upgraded?    A. No. The memory is not user serviceable.
Q. How fast is the N2?    A. Using RAID 1, 108MB/s Read and 65MB/s write speeds are possible on a Windows environment.  (performance can vary in different environments)

SENGI will be happy and you will help us a great deal. click me PARTNERSFAQCan I use my existing cloud-accounts with SENGI?Absolutely. You can link all your existing accounts or simply add new ones. However, the data on your existing accounts must be re-uploaded to guarantee full security.What happens if a cloud provider goes offline, will my data be lost?No. Thanks to redundant data storage and depending on the number of connected clouds SENGI can compensate the outage of at least one provider.  How much do I have to pay for SENGI?SENGI is free. Every user can create a free account and use SENGI as long as he or she wants. There will be premium features but the security on your communication will never be limited.Is SENGI not just another cloud provider?Nope. SENGI merely uses the cloud structure for creating a secure communication and data storage eco-system.Isn't open-source a danger to my data?You probably know exactly how the six sides of a dice look and how rolling it works. However, you will not be able to say for sure what will be rolled next. You can imagine open-source encryption as a billion-sided dice - super secure.If I lose my laptop, can I recover my data with SENGI?Yes. If you have your password in mind and you saved your key-file somewhere you can login from any other device. If you already installed SENGI on multiple devices, your data is automatically synchronized.When will you release?There will be a closed beta for our backers this year. We expect the open beta to be released in the beginning of next year.When will the perks be shipped?Everything we ship is freshly made for you, so we need a little time. However, your perks should be ready until December and shipped before Christmas, ready to be put under the tree.  What platforms are supported?Windows, Windows Phone, OSX/MacOS, iOS, Android and soon Linux.Why all the fuzz about backdoors?To lock your door is pointless if another key exists, that can open all doors. That key could get into the wrong hands and make your home as secure as without having a lock at all. We agree with Tim Cook saying: ""The only way to get information [...] would be to write a piece of software that we view as sort of the equivalent of cancer.""What is a Sengi?A Sengi is a tiny mammal, living in the rainforests of Africa. It distributes its food in a vast network of trails and stashes. Because only Sengi knows its network very well, it is protected from predators and food thieves, much like you are protected from data thieves with SENGI.Despite its looks, it is more related to an elephant than to mice or rats. DON'T PANIC AND SUPPORT US!",22.0,2,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","It's an app for iOS & Android that allows you to be in many places at the same time. Or at least to make everyone believe that

SelfieApp replaces the background of your selfie automatically with almost human accuracy, doesn't require special skills or backcloth, and uses built-in data to make a flawless Fake Selfie. 
So you can show up at the world’s most beautiful showplaces without leaving home.





Select a popular showplace as a background, take a selfie - hocus pocus - you get a mind-blowing plausible fake and spoof your buddies.
 All in 3 clicks!


Why not to watch a short video explaining how SelfieApp works?










Sorry to disappoint, but SelfieApp IS NOT just a concept! It's really real! We've already created a working prototype, that has been tested by a few lucky guys during the public events we attended recently. Here are some pics from there.






SelfieApp aims to make the World perkier. Help us out with bringing it to life and get our gratitude in addition to awesome perks in reward.






























PERKS with physical rewards already contain shipment cost included into the price!


SelfieApp is based on our brand new automated face tracking & cutting-out algorithm. This invention is called Binding of the dynamic reconfigurable circuit – tough as hell to pronounce, but no sweat to use. Basically, SelfieApp's Binding is a program that looks like a very intelligent frame.



The operating principle of our algorithm may remind you of the Green Screen - a technology movie makers use to add VFX. Except for one thing - SelfieApp doesn't require you to stand in front of a green rag or a special background of any kind! Indeed, you simply enjoy taking selfies, and Binding does all the dirty work for you!


Whatever is behind you - for instance, a mess in your room - our app will replace it with one of the fancy pics from our collection.




SelfieApp is packed with hundreds of amazing backgrounds, and more are on the way. It’s a collection of hundreds of licensed high-quality smooth photos of the world’s most beautiful showplaces to be set as backgrounds. 





They also make your Fake Selfies plausible.


SelfieApp has everything to make impeccable fake selfies. Still, we give you everything to fulfill your constitutional right of turning Fake Selfies into pure perfection.

Filters, effects, tools, custom backgrounds – there will be so many ways to enhance your shots with SelfieApp!

Let us know what would you like to see in SelfieApp and we’ll discuss the possibility of adding it. 




We believe nothing should stop people from traveling to beautiful places. We think that you are the main attraction on a selfie – and it’s wrong when your photo is ignored online because of a boring background. We are also pretty sure that this world needs more fun. (BTW, you can't spell 'Crowdfunding' without 'fun'!)


With your support we’ll make SelfieApp a reality. That’s what fascinates us in crowdfunding - like-minded people can do something great together and have a lot of fun.



Usually projects have a timeline, which they are regulary failing. We stick to the plan, that’s why we use a timestick. Second reason - it’s hard to take selfies with a line.









Just imagine what you're getting! SelfieApp turns your smartphone into some kind of teleporter! Still to be sure you really need this app, we suggest taking our special SelfieApp Compatibility Test








Before this
project we were working in mobile games & software development, video games
development and even on TV.
A year ago we teamed up to start a revolution in selfies. With your help we will make this world a bit more funny!",49.0,1,"1 Campaign

The Indiegogo campaign ended more than 4 years ago and I never took the time to update its page -- better late than never I guess. The campaign was a great success and without it MailMate wouldn't exist today. The campaign raised enough money to guarantee 9.5 months of development on MailMate. Obviously, it stretched much longer than that and MailMate is still under active development. If you are interested in an overview of the results of the campaign then check out the <a href=""https://blog.freron.com/2013/crowd-funding-roundup"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog post</a> I wrote back then.</p><p>Version numbers have increased very slowly. At the end of the campaign, MailMate was at version 1.7.2 and it's now at <a href=""https://blog.freron.com/2018/mailmate-1-11-released/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">version 1.11</a>. But version numbers do not tell <a href=""https://blog.freron.com/2017/mailmate-1-10-released/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the full story</a>. You can see how long it'll take you to read through the <a href=""https://updates.mailmate-app.com/release_notes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">release notes</a> of the numerous public releases. You might find it easier to look through the published blog posts which are all available <a href=""https://blog.freron.com/all_posts/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. In addition, there have been hundreds of minor intermediate updates for MailMate users that like to keep up with cutting edge changes.</p><p>Since MailMate is not at version 2.0 then all license keys are still valid and most of them are also going to be valid if I bump the version number to 2.0. You might wonder how I can make a living on MailMate if I don't make money on upgrade fees and that's a very good question. Currently, the development of MailMate relies on new license buyers <strong>and</strong> the wonderful individuals supporting MailMate as <a href=""https://freron.com/become_a_mailmate_patron/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">patrons</a>. This is currently “good enough” for me to continue development, but it's also pretty far from the $5000 per month I stated as my stretch goal when I did this Indiegogo campaign.</p><p>Once more, thanks to everyone supporting the crowd funding campaign 4 years ago. Without it MailMate would not exist today. I <strong>hope</strong> many of you are still happy MailMate users.

I'm a PhD in computer science and for some years I have been working full time on an IMAP email client for Mac OS X. Version 1.0 was released early 2011 and it has been under <a href=""http://updates.mailmate-app.com/release_notes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">active development</a> since then. It is now at version 1.7.1 and you can download it <a href=""http://download.mailmate-app.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">right now</a> if you like.</p><p dir=""auto"">I want <em>you</em> to help <em>me</em> continue the development of MailMate. In particular, I want you to help me complete and release version 2.0 of MailMate. Email clients are notoriously hard to sell and the current sales of MailMate is <a href=""http://blog.freron.com/changing_priorities"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">not enough</a> to fund future development. At the very least, I need funding for the first 6 months of 2014 which is the primary goal of this campaign. The secondary goal is to fund as many months as possible beyond those 6 months. Don't worry, I have plenty of ideas for MailMate to be working on it for many years and I would love to do so.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> If you want to know more about the existing version of MailMate then I recommend the recent post by <a href=""http://www.macdrifter.com/2013/11/mailmate-explorations.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Macdrifter</a>.

It has been done <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_email_clients"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">many times</a> before and it might be hard to understand why anyone would want to do it again. Nevertheless, here I am and that might require an explanation.</p><p dir=""auto"">I'm an academic by heart and to me MailMate is a never ending research project filled with challenging problems.

If the goal is <em>not</em> reached then you are <em>not</em> going to pay anything, but to show my appreciation for your attempt to contribute then you'll still receive a (single) license key for version 1.x of MailMate <em>for free</em>.</p><p dir=""auto"">Most of the perks are personal or site license keys for MailMate 2 (and 1.x) matching the regular price with two exceptions:</p><ol>
<li value=""1"">The $25 perk is a license key which is only valid for version 1.x and you'll be required to upgrade to version 2.0 for another $25 when it is released.</li>
<li value=""2"">The $5000 perk includes <em>me</em> working for <em>you</em> for 20 hours on a specialized bundle of commands just for you or your company (more about bundles further below).</li>
</ol><h1>MailMate 1.7.1</h1><p dir=""auto"">You can read about the existing version 1.7.1 of MailMate on the <a href=""http://freron.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">homepage</a> which also includes a series of <a href=""http://freron.com/screenshots/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">screenshots</a>. Here is the current short description from the homepage:</p><blockquote><p dir=""auto"">MailMate is an IMAP email client featuring extensive keyboard control, Markdown supported email composition, advanced search conditions and drill-down search links, equally advanced smart mailboxes, automatic signature handling, cryptographic encryption/signing (OpenPGP and S/MIME), tagging, multiple notification methods, alternative message viewer layouts including a widescreen layout, and much more.</p></blockquote><p dir=""auto"">The “much more” is not an exaggeration. Read the <a href=""http://manual.freron.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">manual</a> for more details, for example, read about <a href=""http://manual.mailmate-app.com/compose#send_later"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sending messages later</a>, <a href=""http://manual.mailmate-app.com/organize#muting"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">muting</a> mailing list threads, or <a href=""http://manual.mailmate-app.com/custom_key_bindings"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">custom key bindings</a>.</p><p dir=""auto"">It's only fair if I also tell you what MailMate cannot do: 1. MailMate does not support POP3 or locally archived messages (essentially the same thing). 2. MailMate does not support rich text editing (HTML) without the use of the plain text Markdown markup language.</p><h1>MailMate 2.0</h1><p dir=""auto"">Naturally, the features of MailMate 2.0 depend on the time available for its development. The <a href=""http://updates.mailmate-app.com/release_notes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">release notes</a> is a good reference for what is possible within a time frame of 6 months or more and in that context it might be better to think of 2.0 as 1.9 (it's just numbers). In other words, don't think of it as a complete rewrite of MailMate.</p><p dir=""auto"">That said, some 2.0 features are guaranteed since they are already partly implemented as experimental features. You can enable them *right now* in the General preferences of the current version of MailMate. These features include rules and bundles. You probably already know what rules (filters) are, but bundles in MailMate is a new concept which I'll try to describe in more detail.</p><p dir=""auto"">A bundle can be a set of commands, smart mailboxes, various settings, and anything else which forms a natural group of functionality, for example, anything related to a particular type of emails, a particular application, or some company/organization.</p><p dir=""auto""><em>Example 1:</em> Bundles for two applications, OmniFocus and Reminders, are currently included with MailMate. If you hit ⌃⇧A then you'll see the following displayed:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://freron.com/images/add_note.png"" src="""" style=""display: block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;""/></p><p dir=""auto"">Select your desired action and the corresponding command creates a note based on the currently selected email. Alternatively, you can create a rule which creates an OmniFocus note automatically when a certain type of email arrives.</p><p dir=""auto""><em>Example 2:</em> MailMate also includes a very simple command for Lighthouse tickets (a third party support ticket system). When an email notification from Lighthouse is displayed then you can hit ⌃O to open its related web page in your preferred browser. The broader idea is that the same shortcut can be used to do the same for other types of emails (when bundles which recognize the messages have been created for them). This bundle could be extended to provide commands to quickly change the state of a support ticket.</p><p dir=""auto""><em>Example 3:</em> The last example is a proof-of-concept bundle (created for a user) to show that it is possible to make MailMate handle the administration of a *small* list of email subscribers. It includes three commands, “Add”, “Remove”, and “Distribute”. The first two commands can be used manually or with rules to handle incoming subscribe and unsubscribe emails. The “Distribute” command can be used to generate emails to everyone on the list based on a draft created in MailMate. (This bundle is not included with the current release of MailMate.)</p><p dir=""auto"">These are just simple examples. The underlying system is extremely flexible and makes it easy for power users to add functionality to MailMate — functionality which can then easily be shared with other MailMate users.</p><h1>Q and A</h1><p><strong>What happens after the funded period if the goal <em>is</em> reached?</strong></p><p>Ideally, the regular daily sales of version 2.0 are enough to continue full time development. If not then I might create a new crowd funding campaign.</p><p><strong>What happens if the goal <em>is not</em> reached?</strong></p><p>This also depends on the daily regular sales. I'll continue to support existing users, but my primary occupation has to be something else than MailMate.</p><h1>Spread the Word</h1><p dir=""auto"">You don't need to make a contribution to support the development of MailMate.

Innovative products from the East African innovation value chain!
 
Hi, my name is Ruth Sebagereka.
 
Do you have Tangles? Breaking Hair? Dry Hair?
 
They're a thing of the past.  I bring to you- The Truthcomb.
The Truthcomb, brings to the grooming system,- A NEW DIMENSION!
There's nothing like it out there.
 
It's the only comb, IN THE WORLD, that grooms the hair by working in successive layers on the cuticles of the hair.
 
Why is this important?
 
Each individual hair has cuticles on it- like the tiles on the roof of a house.
 
These cuticles need to be kept closed and smooth- to allow for more moisture retention- otherwise the moisture in the hair escapes through raised cuticles.
The Truthcomb helps to raise moisture content levels of the hair.  
 
Smooth cuticles mean soft hair.
 
So, Truthcomb means soft, moisturised, healthy, shiny hair.
 
 
 Your kids will ACTUALLY comb their hair (a miracle?)
 
A Different Kind of Miracle.
 
The Truthcomb is a product of the system put in place by Dr. Kamau Gachigi and Dr. Isaac Rutenberg- to fasttrack innovative products from East Africa to the market.
 
Marking 50 years since independence,  the University of Nairobi Fablab-and the Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Technology (Strathmore University Law School) reclaim the ethos of Pliny the Elder; 
 
""There is always something new out of Africa"".(Pliny the Elder 23 AD-79 AD)
 
 
 
It fills me with gratitude to be a part of this process.
And I hope you will be too.
 
 
The First Product!

Truthcomb Lel (Model 001).(3D print prototype in picture)
 
Truthcomb Lel  (Model 001) is designed for very short hair.
 
It combs the hair- through a gentle process of smoothing the cuticles of the hair. 
It is for women, men and children who wear their hair short.
 
It also works for beards!
 
Where did the idea come from?!?
 
The Truthcomb finds it's nascent embodiment in....the comb found on the leg of a bee!

A bee collecting pollen- to make that golden nectar-honey,-  combs the pollen out of it's hair!
It is this comb that serves as the model for the TRUTHCOMB!
 
And as indigenous African hair grows PARALLEL to the scalp - for which this comb,  stacked in parallel layers was originally designed-  THERE REALLY CAN BE no other way of combing it.
 
Yes-but how did you make the connection?
 
P.R.O.V.I.D.E.N.C.E.
 
 
Material the comb will be made out of.
Truthcomb Lel (model 001)  will be made from PA 6.6(anti-static).  This is a very strong plastic.
The bristle size is in some parts 0.7mm.  So we need a strong plastic to offer you a good product that will maintain it's shape.
Furthermore, the anti-static properties of the comb will contribute to further promote the health of the hair.
 
 
Product Use.


(a.) Hold the comb, such that the bristles lie parallel to the scalp.
 
(b.) The comb goes through the hair horizontally.  The smalll gap between the layers allow for compression of the hair between the layers of the comb.
 
(c.) Horizontal passage of the comb, along with the compression of the hair means that the cuticles along individual hair shafts are smoothed down!
 
You will notice- with continued use of the truthcomb- that your hair likes to take on cork screw curls that correspond to the curl on the lash of your eyes!.

<p>You are out in the city, attend a
party in the evening, you might go to a park during the day or a sports ground.
That's where you meet great musicians, which are surrounded by many people; DJs
shaking up the clubs; dancers showing of their moves; and athletes that pursue
their passion. There are so many sensational people, with whom you might have
something in common, but who you cannot approach for whatever reason. </p>
<p>How about each and every one of them had something on them, that would
allow you to instantly see who that person is and where to find him? Of course,
everyone has a name which, - after you find it out - you can look up for hours
on <i>Facebook</i> and <i>Google</i> between
a variety of namesakes to ultimately give up disappointed.</p>
<p>We want to create an environment
which allows you to easily come in contact with people from all over the world
and that for free.</p>

<p>We give out a <b>#number</b> (e.g.
#1111) to every registered person. This individual number is connected to your
passion and to all your social network profiles (e.g. <i>Facebook, Instagram,
YouTube</i>, etc.). Hence, it allows you to be found everywhere via your
#number, without being approached directly. The <b>#number</b> also offers an easy way
to make contact with the person or allows you to simply enjoy their passion. This
can take place online via your videos / pictures or even offline through our
merchandising products (T-Shirts, Hoddies, etc.).</p>
<p>So you can get additional followers
on <i>Instagram</i>, new subscribers on <i>YouTube</i>, new friend requests on <i>Facebook</i>, and this can happen every time
someone sees your <b>#number</b> printed onto your T-Shirt.</p>

Your network will grow without great effort or
costs. Whether through fans or friends you will be supported and you can
support others, who are part of our community. We as well will support you by
showing your videos / pictures on our website, our blog and of course on our
social networks. <p></p>

<p>You will be part of a world’s first

networks. Due to our “low-personal-data-level” we do not require any kind of
personal data from you. We combine passion and community, enabling people to
connect with each other from all over the world according to their passion. We
want to shake up the ""offline world"" by connecting it with the ""online world"". </p>
<p>By uniting the social networks we
want to show that independence, community and innovation can play a lead role
in the world market.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our goal is to make our community
accessible for even more users. Every single cent from this campaign will go
into the production of shirts and the creation of an amazing App. If the demand
for the first batch is obtained, it will be enough for us to kick-off the project.
More importantly, it will show us that this is a product you really want bring

</div></div>","You are out in the city, attend a
party in the evening, you might go to a park during the day or a sports ground.
That's where you meet great musicians, which are surrounded by many people; DJs
shaking up the clubs; dancers showing of their moves; and athletes that pursue
their passion. There are so many sensational people, with whom you might have
something in common, but who you cannot approach for whatever reason. 
How about each and every one of them had something on them, that would
allow you to instantly see who that person is and where to find him? Of course,
everyone has a name which, - after you find it out - you can look up for hours
on Facebook and Google between
a variety of namesakes to ultimately give up disappointed.
We want to create an environment
which allows you to easily come in contact with people from all over the world
and that for free.











We give out a #number (e.g.
#1111) to every registered person. This individual number is connected to your
passion and to all your social network profiles (e.g. Facebook, Instagram,
YouTube, etc.). Hence, it allows you to be found everywhere via your
#number, without being approached directly. The #number also offers an easy way
to make contact with the person or allows you to simply enjoy their passion. This
can take place online via your videos / pictures or even offline through our
merchandising products (T-Shirts, Hoddies, etc.).
So you can get additional followers
on Instagram, new subscribers on YouTube, new friend requests on Facebook, and this can happen every time
someone sees your #number printed onto your T-Shirt.

Your network will grow without great effort or
costs. Whether through fans or friends you will be supported and you can
support others, who are part of our community. We as well will support you by
showing your videos / pictures on our website, our blog and of course on our
social networks. 















You will be part of a world’s first
innovative community, which offers something different to all the other
networks. Due to our “low-personal-data-level” we do not require any kind of
personal data from you. We combine passion and community, enabling people to
connect with each other from all over the world according to their passion. We
want to shake up the ""offline world"" by connecting it with the ""online world"". 
By uniting the social networks we
want to show that independence, community and innovation can play a lead role
in the world market.


Our goal is to make our community
accessible for even more users. Every single cent from this campaign will go
into the production of shirts and the creation of an amazing App. If the demand
for the first batch is obtained, it will be enough for us to kick-off the project.
More importantly, it will show us that this is a product you really want bring
to life.











What material are the Shirts / Hoodies made of?

Our brands products are produced by the Fair Wear Foundation, guaranteeing for an ethical trade and fairness for the employees. The sizes can be taken from the gallery.



















If
 you have not heard of I-live-my-passion before, we are an independent company that 
believes in innovation through collaboration. We have already built an amazingly strong community of Passioners which is growing by the minute.
We are completely different to any other company you will ever support. All 
of our members can have their say in the direction of our product design. Help us create   ""The Community"" and then be a part of making it yours.
So, are you with us?

 a gig, photos, videos or other actions – as a Passioner you 
can associate everything with your #number and share your passion with 
the world. So without any great effort your network will grow by itself!We
 of course will also support your network growth by daily presenting and

<h2>PeriKEY – YOUR PERSONAL DATA BODYGUARD</h2>
<p>Today’s modern world is run digitally: from websites and logins, to nearly every single transaction. Personal data moves around the web from company to company—often without your explicit consent.</p>
<p>Just think about it: every bank, every shop, every company you have a relationship with—even every hotel you visit—has a digital store with your personal information in it. Thousands upon thousands of pieces of your personal information are floating out in cyberspace, just waiting for someone to hack, use, and abuse.</p>
<ul>
<li>PeriKEY is a secure digital vault application, where every piece of data is encrypted with its own unique digital key--making it nearly impossible to steal.</li>
<li>PeriKEY is a password manager that can autofill credentials and payment information on all the major browsers.</li>
<li>In PeriKEY, you create data cards in the digital vault – for example, your website passwords, credit cards, passport details, and even social security information. Each data card is securely encrypted with a unique digital key that is stored in an application that resides on your personal devices. PeriKEY itself never has access to those keys— they are yours, and yours alone.</li>
<li>PeriKEY allows you to share these data cards safely and securely with people and businesses. When a company wants access to the cards in the vault, they make a request, which pops up on your PeriKEY devices—where you can then control the information they have access to, and exactly how long and for exactly what purpose.</li>
<li>When these companies hold on to a request for a period of time, it is held in ESCROW, where they can only access the data in a controlled digital cage.</li>
<li>PeriKEY runs on Windows, MacOS, Unix, iPhones, iPads, plus Android Phones and Tablets</li>
</ul>
<h3>WHAT IS PeriKEY</h3>
<p>PeriKEY - MORE THAN JUST A PASSWORD MANAGER</p>
<p>Password managers allow you to share a password vault between devices. Which is great, however – it’s not a secure way to share data between DIFFERENT people and businesses. For example, sharing your information checking into a hotel so it does not get leaked, hacked, or shared inappropriately.</p>
<p>PeriKEY is built for personal data and for sharing. Sure, it’s a password manager, but it’s also a secure vault for all your personal information, to keep it safe and secure, AND most importantly SHAREABLE with others (family or businesses) without compromising the security of the data.</p>
<p>PeriKEY is a solution to this problem; we keep your data safe, and allow companies to make specific requests of your data—</p>
<p>all without them having to store and secure it.</p>
<p>WHO WILL BE USING PeriKEY SHARING?</p>
<ul>
<li>Between your own devices. Secured either by password, or two-factor authentication, or biometric – It’s as secure as you want it to be.</li>
<li>Between trusted people: Family and people you trust to have some sort of limited access.</li>
<li>For access by Employees within a company. Imagine not having to give out passwords to employees to grant access to systems.</li>
<li>Between people and businesses: Purpose based data access.</li>
</ul>
<p>PERIKEY BUSINESS SHARING IN ACTION</p>
<p>Let’s take, for example, a car rental. The rental company needs to know a few things about you before they can rent you a car.</p>
<p>Currently, they take a copy of your driver's license to check you have one and that you are over 25. They need your address just in case something goes wrong, and they need a credit card so they can take a deposit and then charge you at the end.</p>
<p>The rental company doesn’t want to store this information, but at the moment they don’t have a choice, and so another hackable trove of your personal information is created.</p>
<p>With PeriKEY it can work differently. You show the rental company your PeriKEY ID (it’s like a super bar code), and the rental company then invokes a request for purpose to the PeriKEY network: Do you have a current driver's license? Are you over 25? What is your address? What card should be charged? - these are purposes - business defined flows where a company needs access to certain information.</p>
<p>These requests from the rental company are forwarded from the PeriKEY network to your personal devices where it pops up a notification that the rental company is asking for this information, the period of time they are asking for it, and what card(s) to use. A pin code and your fingerprint confirm that you want to use the keys on your device to unlock the data to give the rental company the answers to those questions, NOT THE DATA ITSELF. All these purpose-based accesses are made in a secure digital cage, protecting both the consumer and the vendor.</p>
<p>The answers to those questions are then given to the rental company to complete the transaction. That’s right, the rental company doesn’t have your driver's license data, it doesn’t have your credit card details - these are held in ESCROW within PeriKEY. It just has your name, address and telephone number, the answers to the questions, and the right to access that data in ESCROW for the length of the car rental if it needs it.</p>
<p>WHERE ARE WE IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS?</p>
<p>Most of the system is written and has been tested for security and functionality. It uses security practices that are even beyond those used within most government security systems.</p>
<p>It’s a large code base, and currently runs on PC’s, MACs, Apple iPhones and iPads as well as newer Android phones and tablets. It also connects with Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Microsoft Edge browsers for the safe exchange of vault passwords and other data.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611691683/p1jn2igencpqpud2mpcn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>WHY PeriKEY?</p>
<p>Companies don’t want the risk of holding consumers’ personal data; however, currently they don’t have a choice. By using PeriKEY, they can mitigate risk without compromising business workflow.</p>
<p>TARGET AUDIENCE</p>

<p>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS CAMPAIGN?</p>
<p>As we are rolling out a secure product, it requires a lot of testing, both to make sure it works properly, and to probe its security. Because of that, the money will be spent to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish up, pretty up, and test the final application on all the devices.</li>
<li>Set up all the cloud infrastructure for the release.</li>
<li>Extend the existing patents we have.</li>
<li>Perform one or more hackathons where we invite hackers to break the system and offer a reward for the first cracks.</li>
<li>Market this both to consumers and businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>WHAT IS THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN?</p>
<p>In the first phase, we are concentrating on the vault functionality and the sharing between devices and trusted parties. Phase one goal - $50,000.</p>
<p>The second phase will focus on the business version – so that businesses can share information securely with employees and vendors without compromising the data itself. Phase two goal - $75,000.</p>
<p>The third phase is all about consumer to business sharing – the point is to allow you, the consumer, to control who, when, and for what purpose your sensitive data can be accessed without compromising the security of it. Phase Three goal - $175,000.</p>
<p>ANSWERS TO THE ‘HOW IS IT SECURE’ QUESTIONS</p>
<p>WHAT MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO KEEP THE DATA SECURE?</p>
<p>This system uses best of class encryption - digitally scrambling the data, so that only if you have the key that was used to scramble it, can you unscramble and access the data.</p>
<p><strong>Every </strong>separate bit of data is encrypted differently, and those encryption keys, that are required to access the data, are encrypted with your password. We don’t store that password anywhere (so be careful with it) – if you don’t have the password, no one, not even PeriKEY, can access your data.</p>
<p>One of the primary ways hackers get data is to look at the memory of a program as it is running, and to look for things that look like keys, passwords, and data. PeriKEY NEVER stores your data unencrypted, not even in the memory as it's running, making it much harder to hack (and much harder to write).</p>
<p>All data that is transmitted is encrypted using the best methods available on the web, the ones the banks use. We then encrypt it even further – using time dependent keys, and a key from the requestor as well. PeriKEY cannot even read your data, ever.</p> <p>WHAT STOPS SOMEONE FROM CREATING A FAKE IDENTITY?</p>
<p>Things that are identity documents, such as drivers licenses and passports, are required to be validated. This means you will have to take them to someone like a notary or a bank, that will validate them for you – and that data is then digitally signed as valid. Once it's signed, you cannot change it. If you do, then it needs to be re-validated before it can be used as an identity.</p> <p>WHAT PROTECTS THE DATA HELD IN ESCROW?</p>
<p>This was probably the hardest part of the system to work out – and part of the secret sauce. We give requestor keys to the data – but these aren’t the real keys – they are special time-dependent keys – so once the access period has expired – no one – not even the requestor, PeriKEY, or anyone else, can get at your data. There is much more to it than that, but without a week-long explanation, the data is encrypted based on the time-dependent key and the requestors digital signature for that purpose.</p> <p>WHAT STOPS SOMEONE FROM CREATING A FAKE SHARE REQUEST?</p>
<p>All share requests are digitally signed by PeriKEY and the requestor jointly. Unless it's properly signed, it will get rejected and flagged.</p> <p>WHAT STOPS A BUSINESS FROM LEAKING MY DATA, OR CHANGING WHAT THEY DO WITH THE DATA?</p>
<p>All code the requestor runs (such as a business) is submitted and checked by PeriKEY and digitally signed by both parties for a specific purpose. Only digitally signed code can access data for that purpose. We expect all code submitted to be what is known as ""zero knowledge proof-based"" systems, and as such do not transmit personal data elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>Please get the word out, let’s make this real – and take back our data!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you</strong></p>
</div></div>","PeriKEY – YOUR PERSONAL DATA BODYGUARD
Today’s modern world is run digitally: from websites and logins, to nearly every single transaction. Personal data moves around the web from company to company—often without your explicit consent.
Just think about it: every bank, every shop, every company you have a relationship with—even every hotel you visit—has a digital store with your personal information in it. Thousands upon thousands of pieces of your personal information are floating out in cyberspace, just waiting for someone to hack, use, and abuse.

PeriKEY is a secure digital vault application, where every piece of data is encrypted with its own unique digital key--making it nearly impossible to steal.
PeriKEY is a password manager that can autofill credentials and payment information on all the major browsers.
In PeriKEY, you create data cards in the digital vault – for example, your website passwords, credit cards, passport details, and even social security information. Each data card is securely encrypted with a unique digital key that is stored in an application that resides on your personal devices. PeriKEY itself never has access to those keys— they are yours, and yours alone.
PeriKEY allows you to share these data cards safely and securely with people and businesses. When a company wants access to the cards in the vault, they make a request, which pops up on your PeriKEY devices—where you can then control the information they have access to, and exactly how long and for exactly what purpose.
When these companies hold on to a request for a period of time, it is held in ESCROW, where they can only access the data in a controlled digital cage.
PeriKEY runs on Windows, MacOS, Unix, iPhones, iPads, plus Android Phones and Tablets

WHAT IS PeriKEY
PeriKEY - MORE THAN JUST A PASSWORD MANAGER
Password managers allow you to share a password vault between devices. Which is great, however – it’s not a secure way to share data between DIFFERENT people and businesses. For example, sharing your information checking into a hotel so it does not get leaked, hacked, or shared inappropriately.
PeriKEY is built for personal data and for sharing. Sure, it’s a password manager, but it’s also a secure vault for all your personal information, to keep it safe and secure, AND most importantly SHAREABLE with others (family or businesses) without compromising the security of the data.
PeriKEY is a solution to this problem; we keep your data safe, and allow companies to make specific requests of your data—
all without them having to store and secure it.
WHO WILL BE USING PeriKEY SHARING?

Between your own devices. Secured either by password, or two-factor authentication, or biometric – It’s as secure as you want it to be.
Between trusted people: Family and people you trust to have some sort of limited access.
For access by Employees within a company. Imagine not having to give out passwords to employees to grant access to systems.
Between people and businesses: Purpose based data access.

PERIKEY BUSINESS SHARING IN ACTION
Let’s take, for example, a car rental. The rental company needs to know a few things about you before they can rent you a car.
Currently, they take a copy of your driver's license to check you have one and that you are over 25. They need your address just in case something goes wrong, and they need a credit card so they can take a deposit and then charge you at the end.
The rental company doesn’t want to store this information, but at the moment they don’t have a choice, and so another hackable trove of your personal information is created.
With PeriKEY it can work differently. You show the rental company your PeriKEY ID (it’s like a super bar code), and the rental company then invokes a request for purpose to the PeriKEY network: Do you have a current driver's license? Are you over 25? What is your address? What card should be charged? - these are purposes - business defined flows where a company needs access to certain information.
These requests from the rental company are forwarded from the PeriKEY network to your personal devices where it pops up a notification that the rental company is asking for this information, the period of time they are asking for it, and what card(s) to use. A pin code and your fingerprint confirm that you want to use the keys on your device to unlock the data to give the rental company the answers to those questions, NOT THE DATA ITSELF. All these purpose-based accesses are made in a secure digital cage, protecting both the consumer and the vendor.
The answers to those questions are then given to the rental company to complete the transaction. That’s right, the rental company doesn’t have your driver's license data, it doesn’t have your credit card details - these are held in ESCROW within PeriKEY. It just has your name, address and telephone number, the answers to the questions, and the right to access that data in ESCROW for the length of the car rental if it needs it.
WHERE ARE WE IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS?
Most of the system is written and has been tested for security and functionality. It uses security practices that are even beyond those used within most government security systems.
It’s a large code base, and currently runs on PC’s, MACs, Apple iPhones and iPads as well as newer Android phones and tablets. It also connects with Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Microsoft Edge browsers for the safe exchange of vault passwords and other data.

WHY PeriKEY?
Companies don’t want the risk of holding consumers’ personal data; however, currently they don’t have a choice. By using PeriKEY, they can mitigate risk without compromising business workflow.
TARGET AUDIENCE
PeriKEY is designed for consumers, software vendors and companies.
PROTECTED IP
Patents have been applied for parts of the system--specifically the ESCROW and purpose-based systems, as well as portions of the time-based encryption keys.
AN EXPERIENCED TEAM
Our team is made up of experienced software engineers and designers that have worked on international banking platforms, highly secure commercial device control networks and government intelligence systems, making us uniquely qualified to build such a secure system.

Between trusted people with conditions. This is great when you want to say, give your kids-controlled access to a credit card or account. You can specify where, for how long, when, and for what purpose it can be used. For instance, you can specify it can be used by Child X to buy from a clothing store, today only, once, and for less than $100. 

Between trusted people with permission. This is a great way to share a credit card with a child that can use it for emergency purposes. Anytime they try to use it, it will ask for permission from one of your devices, with all the details, before it allows access.

With businesses for a purpose. This is a specific business use case.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>This is our first Kickstarter campaign and we have to learn a lot from this project and the challenges that will come with it. With that in mind, this project has a long runway for fulfillment. This is so that we can create realistic expectations around nailing our timeline. Nobody likes delays, and we’re doing everything we can to deliver on an achievable and responsible schedule.</p>
<p>That said, with a new production partner, we may still have some learning curves ahead of us but our team will be here to communicate along the way.</p>
<p>Another risk we are taking on is offering our campaign to anyone in the world – why is that a risk? Because shipping logistics can get really, really complicated, and very very expensive. We want anyone who wants to have the opportunity to be a backer, and we are doing everything we can to be very upfront about what it takes to get you your Luminiser. We can assure you that we are not making any money on our international shipping fees, only covering a portion of the full charges.</p>

The Luminiser is a compact and durable lantern that uses thermoelectricity to power the LEDs for hours!

By using thermoelectricity, The Luminiser’s patented technology transforms the heat energy from one single tea light candle into a powerful LED light lasting 5-6 hours, providing 15-20 times the light than a candle alone.

No batteries, solar panels or cords required.

Don't take our word for it. Check out all the press buzz!

This is so that we can create realistic expectations around nailing our timeline. Nobody likes delays, and we’re doing everything we can to deliver on an achievable and responsible schedule.

<h3>What does the MXM PeaceMaker Spinner do?</h3>
<p>It's a fidget toy! All you do is fiddle with it. Fiddling can actually help you concentrate. So rather than clicking a pen, or flipping a lighter, or tapping your toe and annoying everyone, you simply place the spinner between your forefinger and your thumb and spin away. Other than the on-point design, the beauty of this spinner, is that it's silent.</p>
<h3>My Campaign</h3>
<p>I'm Jay Erwin, the founder of <a href=""http://metalxmfg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Metal X Manufacturing</a>. Ever since I can remember, I've been a fidgeter. I always have to be moving, tinkering, creating, inventing, manufacturing. I'm a true idea man and am proud of the things I have created.</p>
<p>The MXM PeaceMaker campaign is my effort to get support for a common spinner fidget toy that I reinvented, redesigned and handcrafted specifically for avid 2nd Amendment supporters and for those that just need one more spinner to their EDC collection. I've seen spinners out there but wanted to make one with attitude. It shouldn't be only functional, it's gotta have style. I refuse to make anything sub-par, so I pulled out all the stops for this spinner, which I consider one of my greatest masterpieces. </p>
<p>With your support, I can make this spinner a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Ok so we spent some up front money to have working prototypes made and not just some drawing or concept. We want to make sure you know what your getting. We are looking to cover material cost and place volume orders with our vendors to offer a high quality spinner at a low cost to you.</p>
<p>You cant go wrong with any Perk from us! Check out the description and pictures below to see what you will receive with each Perk option.</p>
<p>All PeaceMaker are constructed from 304 Stainless Steel (SS) and come in two different finishes. You can choose from our Old School Finish (Perks #1,3,5) or Tac Black (Perks #2,4,6). Every PeaceMaker comes with premium ceramic center bearing. If you are ordering a perk with the shell casings (we use once fired brass) we take 12 casings and cut them down so both sides of the PeaceMaker look the same. NOTE: Depending on the supply of shell casing we can get our hands on you will either get 38 Special or 357 Magnum.</p>

So rather than clicking a pen, or flipping a lighter, or tapping your toe and annoying everyone, you simply place the spinner between your forefinger and your thumb and spin away. Other than the on-point design, the beauty of this spinner, is that it's silent.
My Campaign
I'm Jay Erwin, the founder of Metal X Manufacturing. Ever since I can remember, I've been a fidgeter. I always have to be moving, tinkering, creating, inventing, manufacturing. I'm a true idea man and am proud of the things I have created.
The MXM PeaceMaker campaign is my effort to get support for a common spinner fidget toy that I reinvented, redesigned and handcrafted specifically for avid 2nd Amendment supporters and for those that just need one more spinner to their EDC collection. I've seen spinners out there but wanted to make one with attitude. It shouldn't be only functional, it's gotta have style. I refuse to make anything sub-par, so I pulled out all the stops for this spinner, which I consider one of my greatest masterpieces. 
With your support, I can make this spinner a reality.

What I Need & What You Get
Ok so we spent some up front money to have working prototypes made and not just some drawing or concept. We want to make sure you know what your getting. We are looking to cover material cost and place volume orders with our vendors to offer a high quality spinner at a low cost to you.
You cant go wrong with any Perk from us! Check out the description and pictures below to see what you will receive with each Perk option.
All PeaceMaker are constructed from 304 Stainless Steel (SS) and come in two different finishes. You can choose from our Old School Finish (Perks #1,3,5) or Tac Black (Perks #2,4,6). Every PeaceMaker comes with premium ceramic center bearing. If you are ordering a perk with the shell casings (we use once fired brass) we take 12 casings and cut them down so both sides of the PeaceMaker look the same. NOTE: Depending on the supply of shell casing we can get our hands on you will either get 38 Special or 357 Magnum.







Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't help at this time, I would greatly appreciate it if you would tell all your friends! My customers are the most valuable part of my business.
Thank you so much!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

Hi, my name is Rashad Glover and I'm the author of “What They Didn't Teach You About Marketing Yourself”©. Since I graduated from college I have wanted someone to sit me down and show me what steps I needed to take for the various projects I've have done in the past. I was also looking for someone to take me under their wings and show me how to present my ideas and be taken seriously. More importantly, how to complete projects. What I found out was, this person didn't exist and most of the professionals I know struggled with the same issues. These intelligent men and women are 10 to 40 years older than myself, all wondering the same questions. We just wanted road map with easy steps to follow. Here are some of the subjects covered:</div>

 TRIO is an upgraded plug-and-play* solution for a multiple monitor setup while you’re on the go. You can opt for a dual screen to the left or right of your laptop monitor, or clip two TRIOs together for a triple screen viewing experience. The possibilities are endless. *Driver installation is required
 TRIO provides a full 270° rotation, so you can choose your optimum viewing angle for any situation. When using two TRIO’s, rotate them 180° to fold them into a triangle for presentation mode.
 
 Lighter than its predecessor, TRIO has a more compact design for the increased ease and mobility you need to move from workspace to workspace. 
 Simply plug* TRIO into your laptop, and you’re ready to boost your productivity by up to 50%. To make it even easier, TRIO uses only one cable for both power and data.TRIO is compatible with any Mac, Linux, Chrome and Android device via USB connection.*Driver installation is required. 
 TRIO’s new geometric patterned design allows you to show off a little more personality, while its 1080p high-resolution display comes with an all-new adjustable brightness, so everything you see is crisp and clear. Plus, it’s designed to reduce battery drain from your laptop.

<h3>What's Parker1?</h3>
<p>Parker1 is a low-cost WiFi / 4G mobile robot with vision ability. It runs with two popular open source software, Arduino compatible code for easy robot programming, and OpenWrt router OS for a variety of connectivity over WiFi, 4G etc.</p>
<p>Let the users get playing on Parker1 just with a browser device on hand. Parker1 is preloaded with a basic, in full-function codes. And the source codes would be open on internet, hopefully turns into a community-based support system.</p>
<h3>How to Command Parker1 on Play?</h3>
<p>The motion control of Parker1 is quite simple. The user opens a browser window and issues the motion control commands (in ASCII char format) to Parker1 via cgi-script. Then OpenWrt passes it as serial data to ATMEGE328, which runs an Arduino serial monitor and executes the motions accordingly.</p>
<p>As the Arduino lovers, you can just focus on Arduino coding upon the commands received from the serial monitor. And it is possible to add-on extra sensors / circuits with the ATMEGA328 IO pinout header on board. The data pass-over by OpenWrt is transparent to you, the preloaded firmware already take care of it. The video streaming is enabled at boot time, just let the users get started with no plain!</p>
<p>If you are familiar with OpenWrt, Parker1 gives you the freedom in network and webcam config customization.</p>

</div></div>","What's Parker1?
Parker1 is a low-cost WiFi / 4G mobile robot with vision ability. It runs with two popular open source software, Arduino compatible code for easy robot programming, and OpenWrt router OS for a variety of connectivity over WiFi, 4G etc.
Let the users get playing on Parker1 just with a browser device on hand. Parker1 is preloaded with a basic, in full-function codes. And the source codes would be open on internet, hopefully turns into a community-based support system.
How to Command Parker1 on Play?
The motion control of Parker1 is quite simple. The user opens a browser window and issues the motion control commands (in ASCII char format) to Parker1 via cgi-script. Then OpenWrt passes it as serial data to ATMEGE328, which runs an Arduino serial monitor and executes the motions accordingly.
As the Arduino lovers, you can just focus on Arduino coding upon the commands received from the serial monitor. And it is possible to add-on extra sensors / circuits with the ATMEGA328 IO pinout header on board. The data pass-over by OpenWrt is transparent to you, the preloaded firmware already take care of it. The video streaming is enabled at boot time, just let the users get started with no plain!
If you are familiar with OpenWrt, Parker1 gives you the freedom in network and webcam config customization.

<p></p></div>","The idea of BLYZZ first came into my mind years ago. Back then technological advancements didn't reach far enough to upload pictures, videos, etc... to a mobile phone. Today using mobile terminal devices this is optimally possible. DEDie Idee zu BLYZZ ist mir schon vor Jahren gekommen. Damals war jedoch die Technologie nicht so weit, um Bilder, Videos usw.. auf das Handy zu laden. Doch heute mit den mobilen Endgeräten ist es optimal.In short: The user receives content on her Mobile Phone or Tablet (designed for him personally) which he evaluates, buys or even recommends to other people.DEKurz gesagt: Der User kriegt Content  auf sein Tablet oder Handy(der für ihn zugeschnitten ist) und er bewertet diesen, bzw. kauft oder empfiehlt ihn sogar weiter. Why should a user watch content?
1. He receives a reward onto his internal account immediately after evaluation.2. He receives content he may like or be interested in3. There are special actions like coupons or other rewards for the user. 4. He receives additional rewards for recommendations (affiliates) to the              third  downline Level of your invitated Friends.5.  And we have dayly or weekly Contests for the best Users. And they get               Cash or Coupons. 6. The more active and the more honest the user handles content (Scoring)        the higher his income is going to be. DEWarum sollte ein User sich Content ansehen?1. Er bekommt dafür unmittelbar nach Bewertung, eine Vergütung auf sein         internes Konto gut geschrieben.2. Er bekommt Content der ihm interessieren und zusagen könnte3. Es gibt spezielle Aktionen wie Coupons oder Aktionen für den User4. Und für Weiterempfehlung (Affiliate) erhält er zusätzliche Vergütungen           bis zur dritten Tiefe seiner Freunde.  Die Auszahlungen sind dann am                 Endgerät  (Handy oder Tablet) jederzeit ersichtlich und werden ständig            aktualisiert.5.  Und es gibt tägliche, wöchentliche und  monatliche Wettbewerbe mit               Barpreise und Gutscheine.6. Je aktiver und ehrlicher ein User ist, desto mehr Content und Geld wird er        verdienen.     Rewards / VergütungenAre being accredited online immediately and can be requested via Paypal. Or eventually can be changed into coupons of advertisers. (for example less expensive for User, etc...)DEWerden sofort Online gut geschrieben und können mittels Paypal angefordert werden.Oder eventuell auch gegentauscht werden in Gutscheine der Werber (zb. etwas günstiger für User, usw...)SCORINGThis is a flexible value that rises and falls depending on the activity of the USER. The better his value the more content he receives in the future and the more he is therefore going to earn. The lower the value the less content he is going to receive. Can even lead to deactivation. DEBewertungDies ist ein flexibler Wert der steigt und fällt, je nach Aktivität des USERS.Je besser sein Wert, desto mehr Content wird er bekommen und desto mehr wird er dafür erhalten.Je schlechter der Wert, desto weniger Content wird er erhalten. Kann bis zur Deaktivierung führen.For AdvertisersFor the ADVERTISER a purposeful advertising is formed (TARGET-Marketing, similar to Google). There are ways of filtering at the beginning like: Gender, age, country, city and as a result also additional information about the user (which the user specifies in the course of time) like hobbies, preferences, etc...Using our Scoring the advertiser can also declare that he wants to send content to especially active users. Here it is of course necessary to elaborate the process of Scoring but also to offer good content. CouponsIt is also planned that the user can change parts of his rewards into coupons of the advertisers. Here an additional value for the user should exist. DEWerberFür den WERBER ergibt sich ein ziel gerechtes Werben (TARGET Marketing, ähnlich wie bei Google).Es gibt Filtermöglichkeiten gleich zu Beginn wie: Geschlecht, Alter, Land, StadtUnd in Folge dann auch weitere Infos über den User (die der User mit der Zeit angibt) wie zb. Interessen, Vorlieben, usw...Und durch unser Scoring kann der Werber auch sagen, dass er Content an besonders aktive User senden möchte.Hier gilt es natürlich dieses Scoringprozess zu verfeinern aber auch guten Content anzubieten.GutscheineAngedacht ist auch, dass der User einen Teil seiner Vergütungen in Gutscheine der Werber tauscht. Hier sollte es jedoch einen zusätzlichen Mehrwert geben für den User.First App-Designs: Hier erste APP Entwürfe: Design: internal area Entwurf interner Bereich:Login area: Loginbereich:Internal area:Interner Bereich:As previously said, parts of the system are already developed. Still we want to finalize programming the system completely in order to be able to registrate our first users soon.DEWie gesagt, Teile des Systems sind schon entwickelt. Jedoch möchten wir das System komplett ausprogrammieren, um bald erste User registrieren zu können.
What we do with the money & What you get 

The largest part flows into the software-development by my two developers whereby I have already invested my own money and we have started development in March. 

Additional money from the campaign is going to be spent for the USERS in form of constant Contests (here the most active affiliates are rewarded with boni) and for online advertisements.  
Should there be more funds coming in they are going to be invested in additional advertisements (Phone-actions to potential customers, external work,...)  and into expanding the webpage 

For you as an investor there is the possibility of participating in the success of this idea. (Share Program)  

Or you receive special boni and rewards if you log in as user. 
The market is huge. Lots of companies pay a number of euros per click using search engines. In case of us the click will be distinctly cheaper (0,5-1,0 €) and much more effective because the advertiser can define his target audience, for example by gender, city, age, interests, etc...(we are going to create a special analyzing software).   
The user evaluates the watched content. Also a good indicator for the advertiser!  
Of course we are going to try to set filters and will further elaborate the software in order to filter mere ""Clicker"". We thereby think of a Scoring for every User. DE




Für was wir das Geld verwenden & Was ihr dafür bekommt




Der größte Teil ist für die Softwareentwicklung meiner beiden Entwickler eingerechnet. Wobei ich bereits eigenes Geld investiert habe und wir mit der Entwicklung im März begonnen haben.

Zusätzliches Geld aus der Kampagne werden für die USER in Form von ständigen Contests (Es werden hier die aktivsten Affiliierter mit Prämien belohnt) und für Online Werbung ausgeben.  
Sollte darüber hinaus mehr Kapital hereinkommen, werden wir diese für weitere Werbung (Telefonaktion an potentielle Werbekunden, Außendienstmitarbeiter, ...) und in den Ausbau der Seite investieren

Für dich als Investor gibt es die Möglichkeit sich am Erfolg der Idee zu beteiligen. (Share Programm)
Oder wenn du dich als User anmeldest, bekommst du spezielle Bonis und Vergütungen.
Und der User gibt eine Bewertung des gesehenen Contents ab. Auch ein guter Indikator für den Werber!

Und der Markt ist riesig. Viele Firmen bezahlen über Suchmaschinen etliche Euro pro Click . Bei uns wird der Click deutlich günstiger sein (bis 0,5 bis 1,0€) und zweitens viel effektiver sein, da der Werber die Zielgruppe definieren kann.Zb. nach Geschlecht, Stadt, ca. Alter, Interessen, usw... (wir werden hier eine spezielle Analysesoftware entwickeln.

 Wir werden natürlich versuchen Filter zu setzen und die Software zu verfeinern.
Um natürlich reine ""Clicker"" auszufiltern. Wir denken da an ein Scoring für jeden User.


Potential of the idea: Potential der Idee:In my opinion inside a multi-digit range of millions. Of course depends on user-numbers and offered content! DEMeiner Meinung nach im mehrstelligen Millionenbereich. Hängt natürlich von den Userzahlen und den angebotenen Content ab!
But like this in normal CASE Aber so im Normal CASE

2014     15.000 User       Advertisement-income per user minimum 50€             Thereby a total of 750.000€             Reward to the Users up to 50%: 375.000€DE2014     15.000 User       Werbeumsatz  pro User mindestens 50€              Gesamt also 750.000€             Ausschüttung an die User 50%: 375.000€

2015     30.000 User      Advertisement-income per user min. 100€             Thereby a total of 3,0 Mio Euro              Reward to the Users up to 50%: 1,5 Mio €DE2015     30.000 User      Werbeumsatz pro User mind. 100 €               Gesamt also 3,0 Mio Euro              Ausschüttung an die User 50%: 1,5 Mio €

2016-18 Duplication planned2016-18 Verdoppelung geplant

5 % of total income net go to the investors via the diamond package, for example 2015......... 150.000€DE5 % vom Gesamtumsatz netto gehen an die Investoren mit dem Diamantpaket. Als Beispiel: Umsatz:   2015....... 5 %  150.000€    Das wären in dem Fall von 30 Diamant-Unterstützer 15.000€!!             
I think using viral marketing and more effective benefits for the advertiser much higher incomes and user-numbers are possible!DEIch denke, durch das Viralmarketing und den effektiveren Nutzen für den Werber sind hier viel höhere Umsätze und Userzahlen möglich!                                                               
For example: If you look at numbers of Google, our assumptions are not even in a scope of per mille: DEAls Beispiel:Wenn man sich Zahlen von Google ansieht, dann sind unsere Annahmen nicht einmal im Promillebereich:

</p><p></p>WbSrch is a project that I started a little over two years ago, after AltaVista shut down. It's online and running, but it's pretty early-stage.<br/><b><br/>Why Build a Search Engine?</b><br/><br/>Almost all of the search engine competition has been shut down or acquired and killed. Blekko, Cuil, AltaVista, and many others no longer exist.<br/><br/>Most other sites claiming to be search engines are just front-ends to Bing or Google results and aren't adding anything of their own.<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>There isn't enough
competition in search and it's a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you run a website
or a web-based business you probably live in constant fear of
angering Google. If it decides it doesn't like you, you're pretty
much done. Close your business, send everyone home, and move on to
something else. You won't get any traffic or any customers if
the gateway to the world's information closes its doors on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a time
when there was enough competition in search that if one engine didn't
like you and one loved you things would balance out. Now there is
effectively only one, Google. Bing has been accused of copying
Google, so that's not exactly diversity.<br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>A few competitors exist, but most don't make a dent in
English-language search: DuckDuckGo, Yandex, Gigablast,
Exalead, and some others you've never heard of.</p><p>The goal is to become a viable alternative, at least at the same level as DuckDuckGo. They have a head start,  since WbSrch is 5 years younger than the youngest one on that list, DuckDuckGo, but we're catching up fast.<br/></p><p><b>The Team</b></p><p>So far this is mostly just a one-person show run from Portland, OR. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonchampion"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My LinkedIn page</a> should give a decent overview of my background. My wife Suzanne has been contributing design, ideas, and testing help and my friend and former startup cofounder Lindsay created the how-to-use video and has offered some marketing help.</p><p>If you know things about search engines and information retrieval, we should be friends, even if we don't end up working together. This project will eventually need more people.<br/></p><p>I like to use ""we"" when talking about WbSrch because it won't always be a mostly-one-person operation.<br/></p><p><b>Where We Are Now</b></p><p>I built a custom crawler and indexer for WbSrch. It has a small database right now, not much more than 13.5 million pages, and the engine is still pretty young. However, over the course of 2015, the database grew by more than 60%. This year I'd like to get to 50 million pages. That's nearly 4x larger -- and it's doable with a hardware upgrade.<br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, now take a break
and go search for something on <a href=""https://wbsrch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wbsrch.com</a>. You can check out the video for more details about basic usage, but it works just like any other search engine you've used. Try a few searches.<br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Back? I bet the
results weren't awesome. But unlike most other search engines pitching for crowdfunding, we do have something up, online, and working. It's not
great yet. But it's making significant forward progress every month (just check out our
<a href=""https://wbsrch.com/changelog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">changelog</a>). This is only a part-time project. I'd love to be
able to work on this for a living, but there's a lot more to do
before I can consider that. It's a big journey. And no, WbSrch is not a Google killer. Don't be silly.<br/></p><p>WbSrch does some things well, and other things not so well. At this point it's about as good as your average mid-to-late-1990s search engine.</p><p>We get about 500 or so searches per day from real people, and another 4x that from bots pretending to be people (the stealth bots love us). Traffic has been doubling every 3 months so far.<br/></p><p><b>Privacy</b><br/></p><p>WbSrch is better than Bing and Google in the privacy department. It doesn't use tracking cookies<i> at all</i>. It logs what requests came from what IP (the same as any typical web server), mostly for blocking spambots, and there's no way to tie a search back to an individual computer or user (an IP address is not a person).<br/><br/>We don't build user profiles of any kind; neither do we provide forced ""customized"" search results (known as ""filter bubbles""). And we don't want to.</p><p><b>The Software</b><br/><br/>I built everything with Python and PostgreSQL. I use the Django framework heavily, as well as SQLAlchemy. It all runs on Linux with an NGINX web server.<br/><br/>Yes, many people call Python slow. That's not the bottleneck here. Our bottleneck is disk I/O speed. Once we've read the data we're going to process, processing it is fast. I <i>wish</i> Python was the slow part because I know C++ (and C) very well and could do a great job rewriting the slow parts. Nope -- the processors are generally pretty bored most of the time. That will gradually change as we get more and more data to process, but it won't be this year.<br/><br/>It's pretty common for an indexing task to take 60 seconds to read the data it needs and then 2 seconds to process it. If read time becomes 6 seconds (10x faster), things become very different.</p><p><b>Hosting</b><br/><br/>We do not use cloud hosting. Cloud hosting companies make their money on RAM, and we have a pretty RAM-intensive system. We'd be paying more than $1200 per month for what we use. And, of course, you're at their mercy if they think you're doing something that looks fishy or too bot-like. You know, like crawling the web. And, of course, lots of sites block access from Amazon EC2 IP addresses. (I don't know whether stackoverflow.com still does, but it did.)<br/><br/>WbSrch runs in a local colocation facility. Hosting costs about $140 per month for 3 dedicated servers (a 5U rack space).<br/><br/>We've bought a few secondhand HP servers from eBay, things that have just gone off-lease and are a good deal. Servers haven't gotten much faster in the past few years (with the exception of SSDs), so we're not suffering too much by using older hardware. Except for the drives.</p><p><b>Our current hardware setup (skip this section if you don't care about technical details):</b><br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454382732/ur9yf4s6orfvsrakd7eh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Index Server</b> -- Contains indexed terms and phrases, along with search metadata. <br/><br/>It's an HP DL360 G6 with 24GB of RAM, dual Xeon L5630 processors (8 cores total), and 4 300GB SAS drives in RAID 10. <br/><br/>It has fairly light load and we could quadruple in size before needing to upgrade. The processors are mostly asleep and disks do most of the work. It has some empty RAM slots, and RAM is cheap, so doubling the RAM would reduce disk load inexpensively (if you can spare PC3-10600R server memory in 4GB or larger modules, please send it our way). And upgrading to 4x 1TB SSDs would make this able to handle growth (in both load and index size) to around 30x what we have now.<br/><br/>Data is split up in such a way that this would be easy to separate into multiple servers as traffic increases.<br/><br/><b>Crawl Server</b> -- Contains pending URLs to be crawled along with page link data.<br/><br/>It's an HP DL160 G6 with 72GB of RAM, dual Xeon L5530 processors (8 cores total), and 4 1TB SATA drives in RAID 10.<br/><br/>This keeps track of URLs. There are a LOT of them, but you don't ever need to access all of them at once, so disk space is more important than speed. It has more RAM than it really needs, so I could always take some from this and move it into the index server if necessary.<br/><br/>This could handle about 6x growth without needing to think about any kind of hardware upgrades. The disks are REALLY slow. This was the first standalone WbSrch server (in 2014), and it just couldn't keep up very well (and that was before we added a RAID controller). Now that it's just adding and removing URLs from a pile a handful at a time, it keeps up just fine.<br/><br/><b>Page Database Server and Indexer</b> -- This is the machine that does most of the work. It keeps crawled pages and generates index data from them.<br/><br/>It's an HP DL180 G6 with 96GB of RAM, dual Xeon L5639 processors (12 cores total), and 8 143GB SAS drives in RAID 10.<br/><br/>The disks are pretty much always pegged at 100% utilization. It can never use all of its CPU cores at once because it's waiting on disk I/O. A RAM upgrade would help, but all RAM slots are filled with 8GB modules, and there's a price jump when upgrading to 16GB modules (though prices have come down a bit lately).<br/><br/>Early in 2015, this was set up with a 6-disk RAID 10 array of 240GB Mushkin Chronos SSDs, the cheapest SSDs you could buy at the time. It was super fast and performed very well for about 4 months. Then 3 drives failed in rapid succession and I had to go back to 143GB SAS drives. Lost all the data on the drives, but I had a backup, so only lost about a month of crawling (luckily no code was lost -- hooray for source control).<br/><br/>By the end of 2016, generation 8 HP Proliant hardware should be pretty cheap, so that might be the right time for more upgrades. Dell has a pretty similar power-to-cost ratio.<br/><br/><p><b>How You Can Help</b><br/><br/>The biggest way you can help is to contribute to this IndieGoGo campaign. <br/></p><p>We'd also love donations of hardware -- maybe your company is retiring some servers and you'd like to help keep them out of the landfill. A
3-year-old ProLiant or PowerEdge that your company has decommissioned
in favor of new hardware and might just leave sitting in a warehouse
is pure gold to us.<br/><br/>You can also help by using the search engine. The way it's built, it gets better as people search for things. Search for yourself, the sites you care about, your hobbies. Things like that will help teach it what's important and worth keeping track of. We'll learn where we have topic shortages, what kind of things we need to add, and what kinds of searches respond too slowly.<br/><br/>Add us to your browser as another search engine. Maybe we're not ready to be your main search engine yet, but you could always try us to get a second opinion when you're not finding what you want in Google or Bing. Or you can just compare results for fun.<br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter or Facebook so you can keep an eye on our progress.<br/><br/>If you know another language, check out that language-specific index, like <a href=""https://fi.wbsrch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fi.wbsrch.com</a> for Finnish. If you can help translate any of the text on one of those sites, send us an email.

One of the things we're building is an advertising platform similar to Project Wonderful (they do ads, but they do them well and aren't annoying about it). You can always use an ad blocker, but I think you can do advertising without being that annoying  (Rule 1: No flash, animated, autoplay audio/video ads, Rule 2: No popups, pop-overs, or pop-unders). Yes, I know you make less money without being annoying.<br/><br/>I also don't like the idea of bidding to change your search position and would like to avoid having that be a thing. It might be inevitable and unavoidable, but I hope not.<br/><br/>We've tried some other advertising providers. One went out of business (it paid badly anyhow). But most providers, including AdSense, don't let you participate if you include links to gambling, porn, drugs, etc. Those are things we deemphasize or exclude based on our content policy, but including links to things ad networks don't like is inevitable.<br/><br/>There are a lot more options in advertising when you get up over the 1 million page views per month mark, so even if we don't have our own ad system, we'll have options. But it's better to control your own destiny if you can, and that's part of the long-term plan.<br/><br/><b>Long-Term Goal</b><br/><br/>I'd like to be able to eventually turn this into a small company, a business with between 12 and 20 employees. It could be bigger or smaller, but that seems like a good size.</p><p>It might be possible to bootstrap/crowdstrap to that point, but I expect to have to raise funds at some point. If you're a potential investor who is interested in keeping an eye on the project, please get in touch.<br/><br/>This search engine isn't going to defeat Google, or Bing. We just want to develop a solid core of returning users who like the way we do things. In fact, where DuckDuckGo is right now would be a great place to be -- 300 million searches per month. We're at less than 0.01% of that right now and have plenty of work to do to get there. If we get over about 2 million searches per month, I can do this for a living instead of a life-consuming hobby. At 5 million per month I can start hiring people to help. Job creation is good, right?<br/><br/><b>Stretch Goals</b><br/><br/>This $3000 campaign will take us to the end of 2016 by allowing us to purchase enough SSDs to get a little bit over a 50-million URL index (4x current size).<br/></p><p>There are also $2000 worth of RAM and CPU upgrades that would make a significant difference.<br/></p><p>Beyond that, there's the epic ""1 billion URL"" goal. Building an index of a billion pages is a massive undertaking. We plan to get there someday, but it won't be fast or cheap. And building something that big isn't a one-person task.

If this campaign raises enough money for an acquisition, they're moving to Portland.<br/></p><p><b>Non-Goals</b><br/><br/>We don't want to build a video hosting site like YouTube or Vimeo. <br/><br/>We don't want to host email.<br/><br/>We don't want to create an online equivalent to Microsoft Office.<br/><br/>We don't want to create a social network. In fact, our index generally deemphasizes social media sites.<br/><br/>We don't want to create a mobile operating system or an app ecosystem.</p><p>We don't want to invent the self-driving food cart.<br/></p><p><b>Undecided Goals</b><br/><br/><b>Maps</b> - I've tried some experiments with OpenStreetMap data and some of the related tools/frameworks. It's been interesting, but I'm not sure whether it's worth doing. The hardest part would be getting reliable business-website-to-address mapping/scraping working. Do you want your search engine to include maps? Let me know.<br/><br/><b>Shopping Search</b> - It seems pretty unnecessary. But the existing ones tend to be not very good. It seems like there are fewer online shops than there were a dozen years ago. Maybe Amazon killed them all, and maybe comparison shopping just isn't a good idea -- it only seems to keep a handful of least-expensive stores happy.<br/></p>
<p>
</p><b>Video Search</b> - We don't want to do video-specific search. *Well, maybe we would, but it
 would involve restricting to a handful of sites (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) 
There aren't really that many video sites left now that YouTube defeated
 them all. Do you want video-specific search? Let me know.<br/><br/><b>Image Search</b> - We don't want to do image search. Not without some really good filtering and categorization code. It wouldn't be great to have every keyword you search for turn up nothing but a wall of butts.<br/><br/>For anything visual, filtering out the ""what has been seen cannot be
 unseen"" stuff is a HUGE task that would require a lot more people to 
accomplish effectively. Maybe we'll do it someday, but it's definitely not a near-term goal.<br/><br/><b>Audio Search</b> - I've thought about this, and though it's interesting, I'd want to do it without including torrent search. Torrent search is very problematic. Just ask ISOHunt and similar sites. I don't want to go there.<br/><br/><b>""Stumbling""</b> - I've always loved the discovery aspect of sites like StumbleUpon. I'm not yet sure how I'd be able to put an interesting spin on it, though. And, without categorization, you run into the ""wall of butts"" problem again. We'll eventually have to get decent machine-learning-based categorization figured out, but I'd rather do this later -- after we get regular search working pretty well.<br/></div>","PurposeThis campaign is to raise funds to purchase new SSD drives to improve the WbSrch search engine.
WbSrch is a project that I started a little over two years ago, after AltaVista shut down. It's online and running, but it's pretty early-stage.Why Build a Search Engine?Almost all of the search engine competition has been shut down or acquired and killed. Blekko, Cuil, AltaVista, and many others no longer exist.Most other sites claiming to be search engines are just front-ends to Bing or Google results and aren't adding anything of their own.

There isn't enough
competition in search and it's a problem.

If you run a website
or a web-based business you probably live in constant fear of
angering Google. If it decides it doesn't like you, you're pretty
much done. Close your business, send everyone home, and move on to
something else. You won't get any traffic or any customers if
the gateway to the world's information closes its doors on you.

There was a time
when there was enough competition in search that if one engine didn't
like you and one loved you things would balance out. Now there is
effectively only one, Google. Bing has been accused of copying
Google, so that's not exactly diversity.

A few competitors exist, but most don't make a dent in
English-language search: DuckDuckGo, Yandex, Gigablast,
Exalead, and some others you've never heard of.The goal is to become a viable alternative, at least at the same level as DuckDuckGo. They have a head start,  since WbSrch is 5 years younger than the youngest one on that list, DuckDuckGo, but we're catching up fast.The TeamSo far this is mostly just a one-person show run from Portland, OR. My LinkedIn page should give a decent overview of my background. My wife Suzanne has been contributing design, ideas, and testing help and my friend and former startup cofounder Lindsay created the how-to-use video and has offered some marketing help.If you know things about search engines and information retrieval, we should be friends, even if we don't end up working together. This project will eventually need more people.I like to use ""we"" when talking about WbSrch because it won't always be a mostly-one-person operation.Where We Are NowI built a custom crawler and indexer for WbSrch. It has a small database right now, not much more than 13.5 million pages, and the engine is still pretty young. However, over the course of 2015, the database grew by more than 60%. This year I'd like to get to 50 million pages. That's nearly 4x larger -- and it's doable with a hardware upgrade.

OK, now take a break
and go search for something on wbsrch.com. You can check out the video for more details about basic usage, but it works just like any other search engine you've used. Try a few searches.

Back? I bet the
results weren't awesome. But unlike most other search engines pitching for crowdfunding, we do have something up, online, and working. It's not
great yet. But it's making significant forward progress every month (just check out our
changelog). This is only a part-time project. I'd love to be
able to work on this for a living, but there's a lot more to do
before I can consider that. It's a big journey. And no, WbSrch is not a Google killer. Don't be silly.WbSrch does some things well, and other things not so well. At this point it's about as good as your average mid-to-late-1990s search engine.We get about 500 or so searches per day from real people, and another 4x that from bots pretending to be people (the stealth bots love us). Traffic has been doubling every 3 months so far.PrivacyWbSrch is better than Bing and Google in the privacy department. It doesn't use tracking cookies at all. It logs what requests came from what IP (the same as any typical web server), mostly for blocking spambots, and there's no way to tie a search back to an individual computer or user (an IP address is not a person).We don't build user profiles of any kind; neither do we provide forced ""customized"" search results (known as ""filter bubbles""). And we don't want to.The SoftwareI built everything with Python and PostgreSQL. I use the Django framework heavily, as well as SQLAlchemy. It all runs on Linux with an NGINX web server.Yes, many people call Python slow. That's not the bottleneck here. Our bottleneck is disk I/O speed. Once we've read the data we're going to process, processing it is fast. I wish Python was the slow part because I know C++ (and C) very well and could do a great job rewriting the slow parts. Nope -- the processors are generally pretty bored most of the time. That will gradually change as we get more and more data to process, but it won't be this year.It's pretty common for an indexing task to take 60 seconds to read the data it needs and then 2 seconds to process it. If read time becomes 6 seconds (10x faster), things become very different.HostingWe do not use cloud hosting. Cloud hosting companies make their money on RAM, and we have a pretty RAM-intensive system. We'd be paying more than $1200 per month for what we use. And, of course, you're at their mercy if they think you're doing something that looks fishy or too bot-like. You know, like crawling the web. And, of course, lots of sites block access from Amazon EC2 IP addresses. (I don't know whether stackoverflow.com still does, but it did.)WbSrch runs in a local colocation facility. Hosting costs about $140 per month for 3 dedicated servers (a 5U rack space).We've bought a few secondhand HP servers from eBay, things that have just gone off-lease and are a good deal. Servers haven't gotten much faster in the past few years (with the exception of SSDs), so we're not suffering too much by using older hardware. Except for the drives.Our current hardware setup (skip this section if you don't care about technical details):Index Server -- Contains indexed terms and phrases, along with search metadata. It's an HP DL360 G6 with 24GB of RAM, dual Xeon L5630 processors (8 cores total), and 4 300GB SAS drives in RAID 10. It has fairly light load and we could quadruple in size before needing to upgrade. The processors are mostly asleep and disks do most of the work. It has some empty RAM slots, and RAM is cheap, so doubling the RAM would reduce disk load inexpensively (if you can spare PC3-10600R server memory in 4GB or larger modules, please send it our way). And upgrading to 4x 1TB SSDs would make this able to handle growth (in both load and index size) to around 30x what we have now.Data is split up in such a way that this would be easy to separate into multiple servers as traffic increases.Crawl Server -- Contains pending URLs to be crawled along with page link data.It's an HP DL160 G6 with 72GB of RAM, dual Xeon L5530 processors (8 cores total), and 4 1TB SATA drives in RAID 10.This keeps track of URLs. There are a LOT of them, but you don't ever need to access all of them at once, so disk space is more important than speed. It has more RAM than it really needs, so I could always take some from this and move it into the index server if necessary.This could handle about 6x growth without needing to think about any kind of hardware upgrades. The disks are REALLY slow. This was the first standalone WbSrch server (in 2014), and it just couldn't keep up very well (and that was before we added a RAID controller). Now that it's just adding and removing URLs from a pile a handful at a time, it keeps up just fine.Page Database Server and Indexer -- This is the machine that does most of the work. It keeps crawled pages and generates index data from them.It's an HP DL180 G6 with 96GB of RAM, dual Xeon L5639 processors (12 cores total), and 8 143GB SAS drives in RAID 10.The disks are pretty much always pegged at 100% utilization. It can never use all of its CPU cores at once because it's waiting on disk I/O. A RAM upgrade would help, but all RAM slots are filled with 8GB modules, and there's a price jump when upgrading to 16GB modules (though prices have come down a bit lately).Early in 2015, this was set up with a 6-disk RAID 10 array of 240GB Mushkin Chronos SSDs, the cheapest SSDs you could buy at the time. It was super fast and performed very well for about 4 months. Then 3 drives failed in rapid succession and I had to go back to 143GB SAS drives. Lost all the data on the drives, but I had a backup, so only lost about a month of crawling (luckily no code was lost -- hooray for source control).By the end of 2016, generation 8 HP Proliant hardware should be pretty cheap, so that might be the right time for more upgrades. Dell has a pretty similar power-to-cost ratio.How You Can HelpThe biggest way you can help is to contribute to this IndieGoGo campaign. We'd also love donations of hardware -- maybe your company is retiring some servers and you'd like to help keep them out of the landfill. A
3-year-old ProLiant or PowerEdge that your company has decommissioned
in favor of new hardware and might just leave sitting in a warehouse
is pure gold to us.You can also help by using the search engine. The way it's built, it gets better as people search for things. Search for yourself, the sites you care about, your hobbies. Things like that will help teach it what's important and worth keeping track of. We'll learn where we have topic shortages, what kind of things we need to add, and what kinds of searches respond too slowly.Add us to your browser as another search engine. Maybe we're not ready to be your main search engine yet, but you could always try us to get a second opinion when you're not finding what you want in Google or Bing. Or you can just compare results for fun.Follow us on Twitter or Facebook so you can keep an eye on our progress.If you know another language, check out that language-specific index, like fi.wbsrch.com for Finnish. If you can help translate any of the text on one of those sites, send us an email. The translations we do have are mostly from dictionaries and not by native speakers (I have a big pile of dictionaries, in dozens of languages, but only have native-level fluency in one).If you have a website, a blog, or any other web presence, we'd appreciate a mention or a link. Talk about us. Compare us to other search engines, favorably or not (good reviews attract new users, bad users help us improve). Show us to your friends.If there's something you want or don't want in a search engine, or if there's some killer feature that would make you switch away from your current search engine, please let me know.

What's the money for?The biggest thing holding growth back is disk speed. Upgrading to SSD drives will allow us to grow, improve, and iterate faster. A proper upgrade isn't extremely expensive, but it's expensive enough to ask for help.

isn't a showstopper. It'll just take a lot longer to improve. We'll eventually upgrade; it'll just take longer to save up.Because of this,

</div></div>","Background



Camptocamp kickstarts a new crowdfunding campaign in order to develop the Odoo Magento Connector for Odoo 8 !
We estimate that EUR 15’000.- need to be collected to start this exciting project and provide the community with a one-to-one migration development.
If we collect more than EUR 15’000.- we do have a lot of ideas to extend the features of the Odoo Magento Connector: multi-company support, synchronization jobs’ categorization for optimized performance…Feel free to also make your own suggestions by sending an email to funding@camptocamp.com !
The Odoo Magento Connector for Odoo 8 will be based on the OpenERP Magento Connector for OpenERP 7 and will have the following core features:



Compatible with Odoo 8 and the latest Magento versions (1.7 or later);


Synchronization of customers, sales orders, invoices, payment and shipping status;


Multi-Websites, multi-Stores, multi-Storeviews, and even the possibility to connect several Magento instances on the same Odoo back-end;


Multi-Warehouses, multi-Currencies and multi-Languages;


Magento typology of products supported: simple, grouped and configurable products.




It is also intended to provide the public with an update on the comprehensive developer’s technical documentation aimed to help to implement the Odoo Magento Connector for Odoo 8 best.
The previous OpenERP Magento Connector for OpenERP 7 – see: www.openerp-magento-connector.com – initally required more than 60 man-days of software development to meet the demanding needs of well-established e-commerce businesses processing between 100 to 2’000 sales orders each day. Apart from being ideally suitable for important Magento e-shops, this new-generation connector gained a huge interest among the Odoo community : hundreds of messages were exchanged between users and the supporting community of this project, and we are really proud of that !


What will be achieved with the collected funds?




Migration of the Magento connector module itself (magentoerpconnect) and adaptation of the module to the updated Odoo data model;


Migration of all the e-commerce modules used by the connector (connector-ecommerce, sale_automatic_workflow, sale_payment_method, product_m2m_categories, magentoerpconnect_options_active and magentoerpconnect_pricing);



Update of the API;


Update of the developer’s documentation;


For those who were already using the OpenERP Magento Connector for OpenERP 7: availability of an additional migration routine, which will migrate your data (associated to the connector modules) from OpenERP 7 to Odoo 8.



The project's deadline is supposed to be March 31st. Once the development work will be completed, this module will remain under an Open Source license (AGPL v3).
To benefit from a great and quality module with a solid and worldwide community support, help us now to gather the needed funds to start the development of the Odoo Magento Connector for Odoo 8 !

All the new sights to see, people to meet and experience to have. It’s our retreat from our busy lives and, if it’s a rewarding trip, our little paradise. Many love to travel in groups, be it friends or families, and just let loose and have a good time together. Yet, there are also those who choose to travel on their own. But with fear of the unknown, the thought of being on their own in a foreign land may be intimidating to some. We understand the struggles that go into this and that’s why we came up with Alfred. A travel device that will be your future travel companion.     First thing first, having a constant functional internet is undeniably a big plus while travelling. Alfred not only is capable of generating a strong internet, it does so in the most affordable prices possible. Compared to other services, which charge for around USD10 per day, Alfred offers prices as low as USD0.2 per day for selected countries. Even at its most pricey option, the internet will be available at a mere USD1.1 per day. Our plans cover 80+ countries, so now you will be able to enjoy that beautiful scenery and post that Instagram story simultaneously at a low price anywhere!  For more details on the prices, click here. You’ll be able to connect with friends and families while you’re away and upload those enticing food photos and breathtaking scenery shots to your social media accounts while being on the spot! And if there’s more people in your trip, Alfred’s hotspot supports multiple connections as well. A high-connectivity mobile hotspot and it’s all your own. Having a solid, actionable plan can make for a smooth, easy and even memorable trip. Yet, it’s often mundane and troublesome to crawl through guidebooks after guidebooks to decide on what to do. It’s even harder when you’re planning on your own. As a travel companion, one of the main features of Alfred is the itinerary function. it will show you a map of recommended tourist spots for you to quickly plan your own day trip. Whenever you’re fussing over what to do or where to go, Alfred will be able to give you a few pointers to get you started.  To help make the process much smoother, Alfred also has a map filled with markers of renowned tourist attractions. Perfect for people who want to know as much as possible before leaving for the day or those adventurous individuals who enjoy spontaneity. With the map, you’ll be able to see all the tourist attractions that are currently around the area you’re in. It’s also handy as quick reference in case you wander around too much and got lost among the streets and people. And when you’re feeling peckish, the map also offers locations of restaurants nearby to satisfy that appetite and quench that thirst!   For people with a zest for learning about the history of places, don’t you worry, Alfred does more than gives you a nice start to your trip. With Alfred, you’re able to learn about the tourist spot you plan to visit while wandering around on the spot! How? With its huge database on tourist spots all over the world, Alfred is able to provide audio tracks containing information and facts about the place.  You are able to pair a bluetooth earphone(s) of your choice or our complimentary one while using the audio guide feature and even during translation! With a built-in high-sensitive mic, our complimentary wireless earphones makes the process of speech translation even more natural and smoother than when done with the device.  What really makes Alfred shine though, is its efficient translation system. Alfred is capable of translating 108 languages, including accents and dialects. It’s connected to 8 well-known and powerful databases, such as Google, Baidu and Microsoft. As each of these databases has their own advantages in terms of accuracy and amount of phrases, Alfred automatically switches between them to produce optimized results. This will ensure that no matter the language Alfred picks up, it will navigate to the right database and pulls up the best translation and audio possible. Furthermore, Alfred also utilizes the AI voice-recognition software of related leading technology companies such as Nuance and iFlytek.This ensures that no matter how accented the voice is, Alfred will be able to pick up and understand what was being said with a high accuracy. Prepare to break down those communication barriers with Alfred and the days of language miscommunication and misunderstanding is now in the past.To add to that, Alfred also offers image translation*. So for languages foreign to you, not only will you be able to hear and understand, you’ll also be able to see and comprehend.  Use it to understand road signs, restaurant menus, price descriptions, ticket purchase instructions and any other struggles that may surface due to language barriers. And for people with the courage and will, image translation can help you understand product descriptions, fascinating posters, interesting street signs and more! Ever been inside a restaurant and you can't even understand a word on the menu, so you ordered randomly and ended up with something that you don't enjoy? Discover the joy of gradually understanding an unfamiliar world with the help of Alfred!  Alfred has all the features packed in one place, so it’s easier and more convenient to operateWhile traditional phones use directional near field reception for sound input, Alfred uses a far-field voice pickup system for better reception in translation-required scenariosYour personal mobile phone contains all your private information and messages, so it is relatively inconvenient when doing speech translation. In this case, Alfred will be better suited for this task.Most translation apps have their own respective local servers, which has their own advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, Alfred combines and utilizes renowned servers all at once to achieve the optimal translation result.

<p><strong>Is MILK available for Android and iOS?</strong></p>
<p>MILK will only be available for iOS in the Spring...however the Android version will be released later this summer.  So by the time most of you receive your perks, the app will be available in the Google Play Store as well.</p>
<p><strong>What are considered ""milk zones"" and what if I can't find any near me in order to use the app?</strong></p>
<p>Milk Zones are establishments such as movie theaters, restaurants and entertainment venues.  If you don't see any near you, contact us!  You may live in a small town or just right outside the radius of our technology where the app is having trouble picking up nearby zones.  Give us your zip code and we can fix that issues in seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Is there no limit to how many points I can collect in one setting?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Depending on what app version you have, your location and other factors--you will be allowed to Milk The Moment between 30 minutes to 4 hours in one setting.  There are also daily limits set in place just to keep things fair.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if I'm Milking the Moment and decide to use my phone anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Any time you pause or step away from the app while Milking the Moment, you lose points.  If you deactivate the app completely before your time is up or step away from the app and never return, you'll have to wait for quite some time before you can Milk the Moment again.  We had to place some consequences in the app or it defeats the purposes if everyone can just continue to use their phones as usual.  When there's a consequence, it helps the user think twice about interrupting their experience and makes it easier to rack up on points.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I upgrade to the Premium Version of the app once it's released?</strong></p>
<p>The Premium version of the app allows you to activate the app almost anywhere you like such as: your home, office, vacation rental, favorite park, the library and more.  This makes it more convenient and easy to collect points.  The Premium version also gives you the option to redeem your points while you're at an establishment that is considered a Sponsored Zone.  So for example, let's say you walk into a Sponsored Restaurant Zone.  You may be able to use your points to get half off on your appetizer, a $3 discount on your bill or a free dessert - right then and there.! Since we are just starting out, we will inform you that there won't be many Sponsored Zones in the beginning but they are definitely on the way.  Lastly, the premium version makes you eligible for sweepstakes and instant win games.  You could literally just get done with Milking the Moment and receive a message in the app that you've just won something HUGE!</p>
<p><strong>Can you use the MILK App in the car?  What about with your GPS?</strong></p>
<p>Next on the agenda is the car version of the MILK App.  We will start the development process on this very soon and once its done, you will be able to upgrade to the car version via the app.  As far as using your GPS, that is totally possible. Before you activate MILK, open your GPS,  setup your address and make sure the app has the voice directions on. Open the MILK App, activate it and lock your phone and begin to drive.  That's it!  Almost all GPS apps have a voice option and even shows you visual directions as the phone is in lock mode, so the MILK App works fine!</p>
<p><strong>What if I want to make a contribution, but I don't want anything in return?</strong></p>
<p>This works for us!  All you have to do is click the <strong>BACK IT</strong> button.  It will ask you if you want to purchase a Perk Pack or if you only want to make a contribution and get nothing in return.  We appreciate you for your donation.  It means a lot!</p>
<p><strong>When should I expect my perk pack to be completed or delivered?</strong></p>
<p>Some things can be completed very soon such as the social media shout outs, thank you notes and sweepstakes entries.  However, other things that are related to the app must wait until after you've downloaded it and created an account.  Other tangible items take a long time to manufacture, process, ship and reach their destination so just to be safe, we are giving ourselves until mid to late Summer to deliver.  It could be much earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Can I make customized or special requests for my perks pack such as color change, unique size, etc?</strong></p>
<p>We understand that you may want things in a specific size, color or build.  We will try accommodating these requests, but do know there's a possibility that these requests may be difficult to fulfill. For example, most of the cell phone cases are for smartphone models 8 and up. It may be impossible to get a case from our specific manufacturer that fits older smartphones.  We advise that you find a close family member or friend to give your perk to as a gift, just incase this happens.</p>
<p><strong>Im interested in one of your business perks.  Does my business have to be a MILK Zone?</strong></p>
<p>No. You can have any type of business, project, venture or announcement showcased in our app.  The artwork and content will have to be approved.  It must be high quality, non-offensive and in good taste.</p>
<p><strong>How are the gift cards delivered?</strong></p>
<p>If you select a perk pack that has a gift card option included, this gift card will be sent to you in a digital form via your email address.  You can print it or show your phone to a staff member.</p>
<p><strong>How does the Free Pizza 4 a Year Sweepstakes work?</strong></p>
<p>1-2 names will be pulled and those winners will begin to receive a Dominoes Gift card on every last Friday of the month for an entire year.  The gift card will be sent digitally via email.</p>
<h2><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h2>

<p>Every startup company comes with challenges and we aren't afraid to share ours with others.  You may have great ideas and solutions for us. So we're all ears! Please feel free to send us feedback.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Chicken or the Egg Dilemma:  </strong>Our biggest challenge is being stuck in the situation where investors, partners and sponsors aren't in a rush to get involved, until they see how many downloads the app has had, how many users are active on a daily basis and at what rate the app is growing.  However, in order to advertise the app, keep users active and grow the company we need investors and partners in place.  So which comes first?  The Chicken or the Egg?  The Users or the Investors/Partners? This is a very common problem for startups and we are constantly trying to create new ways to get around this dilemma and this is one of the reasons we've launched an Indiegogo Campaign.</li>
<li>
<strong>Bootstrapping:  </strong>This term means to find creative ways to fund your startup without investors, rather that be: working a 9-5, using your savings, asking friends and family, taking out a loan or using the sales from your product to go right back into your company expenses.  The great thing about Bootstrapping is - you own majority of your company.  The bad thing is - you run the risk of depleting all the funds that you have in a very short amount of time.  We are currently bootstrapping so this risk haunts us every day.</li>
<li>
<strong>Small Team:  </strong>With the MILK app still being in development and not fully launched, our team has been able to conquer any task.  However, now that we are getting closer and closer to launching the app to the public, we run the risk of being overwhelmed with requests, administrative duties, marketing campaigns, design work and sales tasks.  We are currently looking into temporary staff hires and interns.</li>

<p>We have so many plans for the future and we are excited about each and every one of them.  Though we can't share all of them at this time, we have two plans where your feedback is needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have been discussing the topic of creating a backend dashboard in the future where regular MILK users can ""sponsor"" their own zones.  Meaning, people who use the app in your home or any other private address can redeem their points for whatever rewards YOU have placed in your dashboard.  For example, maybe you would like to reward your kids more allowance, a trip to Disney or a later curfew when they do great a great job at Milking the Moment?</li>
<li>There's been requests that other digital items are placed in the app as rewards such as mp3's and ebooks.  We will continue to discuss what other rewards our users may want to see inside the MILK App.  Right now, we are currently looking into adding tangible products that could be provided by sponsors.</li>

</div></div>","Why the MILK App Was Created

With relationships breaking apart, families no longer conversing, experiences being missed and distracted driving wrecks on the rise...we decided to create an app that encourages users to Milk the Moment instead of Miss the Moment.  Through the power of incentives, the MILK App will encourage users to be more present, considerate, intimate, focused and safe.
Why We Need Your Help

In the tech industry, investors like to see how much money you can raise on your own before they get involved in the funding process.  This shows them that people support your product and your mission.  We've developed the beta version of the app with our own money, but in order to add more features, create the final product and deliver it to the public - we really need your help! 

 

How Does It Work?

Free Version of the App:

You first must enter into one of our MILK Zones which are geo-fenced hot spots where the app can be activated.
You set the timer, press start and lock your phone.
The app will begin to accrue points every minute that the phone is not in use
Once you have enough points, you can redeem them inside the app for Cash and Gift Cards.  *Gift card choices and features are limited for the free version.


Premium Version of the App:

For a premium fee you can Milk the Moment pretty much anywhere you want such as your house, office, vacation rental, favorite cafe, the park, library etc
You also have access to our Sponsored Zones which are establishments where you can redeem your points right after your experience. For example, a sponsored restaurant zone may immediately award you with a half off appetizer, $3 discount or a free dessert just for Milking the Moment!
Lastly, you are eligible to be selected as a lucky Sweepstakes Winner or Instant Winner.  These are ultimate rewards that are sent through the app to random users.  *Over 25 Gift card choices and unlimited features in the premium version.                          


Upcoming Features

MILK CHALLENGE
This feature allows you to challenge your friends to a game of MILK to see who can refrain from using their phone for the longest amount of time while at a social gathering.  The winner will receive special badges, trophies and bonus points.


MILK MEMORIES
This a feature allows you to take one quick photo or video inside the app and it launches a countdown to encourage you to hurry back so you can continue milking the moment. 

Instant Winner
After you're done milking the moment, you may just be the winner of something HUGE!  Every now and then our sponsors will award one lucky user with anything from a free meal to backstage passes.

<p>The engine is installed inside a
waterproof body, there are no moving parts or propellers on the outside. It’s a flying <b>waterproof sphere</b>, not
affected by wind* or any kind of weather, fly it in air and feel free to dive
underwater* anytime.</p>
<p><br/>There’s a camera eye and connectors on
the bottom, beside this… the body is solid, <b>you can paint it or dress it</b>. You can be piloting a disco-ball, a
death star, a gigantic eyeball…. Whatever you’re in to. Oh and another thing, flying propeller
drones is fun, but flying an LGE is a completely new thing, it’s more like
commanding an object to move around space, rather than fighting air to keep up.<br/>* Details in specification.<br/><br/></p>

<p>It all started back in 2012 when me and Pawel came up with and started working on this project, at first it was a chain of fails, but we didn't give up...  it took almost a year to apply corrections and almost another year to create final version the liquid capable of working correctly inside this high pressure engine. Of course both of us have work, families, kids, it was very hard to accord our everyday life with this project. </p>

<p>On the 3rd of August 2015 the prototype was finally ready, it worked for 9 seconds, it stayed 2 meters above ground, caring weight of 1 KG, for 9 long seconds and... crashed (breaking also the garage door). 9 long seconds, before it broke.

<p>We can’t stop now, at this moment our engine is still unstable, and sometimes unpredictable, due to all corrections, fixes, rebuilding, and mistakes we have made from the beginning.

<br/>How does it work?<br/>Long story - short: The liquid inside opposite rotating wheels produces centrifugal energy, proper distribution of liquid’s mass causes the device to maintain a constant directional pull. The most of the success lies in the liquid’s formula (patent pending), the viscosity, weight, magnetic properties etc. are a result of endless calculations, experiments and tests.<p></p>

<p>Just imagine how much can the world
change once LGE engine is ready. We already proved that the engine can carry
itself + additional weight of abt 800 grams, of course we would like to tell
you that it will be shortly ready carry people and cargo, but it's not that
easy. When it comes to propeller engines, the rule is simple - build a bigger
propeller so it has more power, in case of LGE engine this does not apply, for
each engine size different amount of liquid should be used, depending on this
the size and amount of wheels will be different, and each size, weight &amp;
amount of wheels must be controlled with a updated control unit, gyroscope and

My name is Jacek, I’m most thankful for
visiting our Indiegogo campaign.
Not interested in drones? Please support
our project with 1$, thank you!
LGE stands for Liquid Gravity
Engine. 






Do you like drones? Well we’ve got news
for you. LGE takes drones flying to all new level of fun.



The engine is installed inside a
waterproof body, there are no moving parts or propellers on the outside. It’s a flying waterproof sphere, not
affected by wind* or any kind of weather, fly it in air and feel free to dive
underwater* anytime.
There’s a camera eye and connectors on
the bottom, beside this… the body is solid, you can paint it or dress it. You can be piloting a disco-ball, a
death star, a gigantic eyeball…. Whatever you’re in to. Oh and another thing, flying propeller
drones is fun, but flying an LGE is a completely new thing, it’s more like
commanding an object to move around space, rather than fighting air to keep up.* Details in specification.
LGE Drone 1: First drone using LGE engine. Sphere
shape, no outside propellers or moving parts.All weather proof / not affected by wind
(up to 6 points bs). Waterproof /can dive up to 1,8 m (5 ft). Bump-proof soft
leather-like coating.

Drone equipment:

Live streaming video quality: 720pLevitate / flight time: 30 - 40 minutesMax speed: 60 km/h (37 mph)Max altitude: 122 m as per FAA
regulation, user adjustable (400 ft)Communication: Secure WiFi network, 2.4
GHzWeight: 1,5 Kg (3.3 lbs) (With dock
weight included). Dimensions: Diam 25 cm (10 inch)Battery charge time: 50 - 65 minutes

card expandable)- AC Receiver charger 110 / 230 V- Control unit with micro USB mobile
phone connector- Software (Flashdrive or provided
download link) + instruction

Before you ask…- The length of stored recording depends
on SD card capability and video settings- The drone is water / all-weather /
wind (up to 6 points) proof- The dock and charger are not
waterproof- This drone can operate in temperature:
from -15 to 45 deg. Celsius / from 5 to 113 deg. Fahrenheit.- In case of air temperature below -5 C
/ 23 F docking / charging should take place in place with higher temperature- In case of air temperature above 30 C
/  86 F the dock should be placed /
charging take place in shadowed area.- Drone equipped with a 1/4 inch screw
mount bay.*- Drone is capable of lifting external
weight of 0,8 KG (1.7 lbs)** In case equipment is installed through
mount bay, auto-docking and manual docking is unavailable.
LGE Security Drone description:Security drone equipped with 3 wide
angle cameras (night vision included) and one bottom torch (24 super-white
LED).The drone can be programmed to fly
around property (follow programmed path) and stream live video to receiver,
once batteries reach 15%, drone automatically returns to dock to charge up.
Once battery recharges, drone resumes to follow programmed path. Drone can be
programmed to  automatically start
programmed patrol on particular weekdays and hours. In case the drone meets any
problems (interception, lack of communication) the dock / receiver sounds an
alarm.

However, it's a topic that's hardly addressed on a national level; at best, information is presented in a fractured way that makes it difficult to make an informed decision. What material is available is limited and biased, only providing Medicare's assessment. Many people don't know where to begin to do research; when faced with a crisis, they panic because they don't have a plan of action.</p><p>Plus, we've all heard nursing home horror stories from talking with peers or in the news. The fact is that nursing home inspections are conducted with limited regulations and minimal standardized requirements. Unfortunately, this means substandard living conditions and elder care abuse are rampant in facilities that have underlying issues like greed, understaffing, overmedication, and unsafe conditions.</p>All of us have an amazing grandma, father, or friend that we love dearly. We have their best interests at heart, so why would we risk placing them in a poorly run nursing facility? Let's make sure they are happy and treated with dignity and respect as they enter their golden years. Let us help you find the best nursing home scenario for your elder loved ones with Rate Mom’s Nursing Home. <p></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/99450/files/20130927091258-family-moments.jpg?1380298378"" src="""" style=""""/></i><b>The faces of today's elder generation.</b><i> Clockwise, from top left, courtesy of Flickr Creative Commons: Dustin J.

Center: Our creative director with her awesome, beloved grandma ""Nana.""</i></p><h3>How Rate Mom’s Nursing Home Works</h3>Before choosing a nursing home, the resident/family/guardians need a comprehensive resource to easily research the quality of nursing facilities. Rate Mom’s Nursing Home is a web- and mobile app-based solution that will have the following components:<p></p><p>• A web browser-based product that uses ZIP codes or other location requests to identify local nursing homes, review ratings, collect information, and report on them.</p><p></p><p>• User-submitted reviews are collected and compared to the facilities' Medicare.gov ratings for a deeper, enhanced evaluation of the nursing home. Users can post pictures, video, and audio to enhance their comments.</p><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span

<b>BETH SILVER, PR Consultant for Rate Mom’s Nursing Home</b>. While her role with Rate Mom’s Nursing Home is focused on public relations, Beth believes an integral part of her job is her role as a brand ambassador who enthusiastically communicates Rate Mom’s Nursing Home’s mission. Beth’s perspective on elder care was changed forever when My Elder Advocate served as elder and patient advocate for her grandmother Sylvia Balaban. The experience taught her the importance of a comprehensive elder care resource, and that such a resource can help people across the country better understand the elder care landscape, as they support their parents and grandparents as they move from independent to assisted and nursing<br/>home living.<br/><br/>For almost 20 years, Beth has been helping entrepreneurs leverage their business assets to increase sales, improve customer communications, and maximize brand effectiveness.  Beth’s well-rounded, unique perspective as Managing Director of Doubet Consulting, a marketing and PR firm focused on empowering business owners, has helped companies of all sizes improve how they bring their products and services to market. <br/><br/>Companies Beth has worked with include: Classroom School Uniforms, the Jewish Education Project, the Small Business Summit, WomanCon, the UJA Federation, Global Pet Expo, NY Expo Business &amp; Conference, Sci-Tech Kids, DyslexiaVille, and others.<br/><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">______________________________________________________________________________<br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h3><h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">Elder Statistics in the U.S.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h3><h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h3><h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><h2><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h2></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><h2><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

However, it's a topic that's hardly addressed on a national level; at best, information is presented in a fractured way that makes it difficult to make an informed decision. What material is available is limited and biased, only providing Medicare's assessment. Many people don't know where to begin to do research; when faced with a crisis, they panic because they don't have a plan of action.Plus, we've all heard nursing home horror stories from talking with peers or in the news. The fact is that nursing home inspections are conducted with limited regulations and minimal standardized requirements. Unfortunately, this means substandard living conditions and elder care abuse are rampant in facilities that have underlying issues like greed, understaffing, overmedication, and unsafe conditions.All of us have an amazing grandma, father, or friend that we love dearly. We have their best interests at heart, so why would we risk placing them in a poorly run nursing facility? Let's make sure they are happy and treated with dignity and respect as they enter their golden years. Let us help you find the best nursing home scenario for your elder loved ones with Rate Mom’s Nursing Home. The faces of today's elder generation.

Users can post pictures, video, and audio to enhance their comments.• Additional feature-rich content that will help users make the best choices.• A mobile app with geolocation capabilities to identify nursing homes within a specified radius.Search with geolocation capabilities anywhere in the U.S. Grandpa can share his nursing home experience.

I terminated service due to type1 diabetes. In 03/2017, I had two strokes because of it.  I spent about the next month in a coma and two more weeks in a rehabilitation hospital. I am nearly 90% recovered. I have physical and cognitive deficits that prevent me from returning to teaching.  I used to be a teacher of US and World History. I lost extensive language capacity. I used to speak other languages as a result of my time in the Army. I thankfully retained English but lost the others.   I no longer remember names and faces easily.  It takes me several meetings to connect names and faces.  I also lost cognitive filters, and have difficulty following multiple people in conversations in large groups. These deficits reasonably prevent me from teaching, and I need to start a new business that will let me be self-sufficient and on my own.  I have been told that I am too recovered to qualify for disability, and I really would rather work than not. My physical deficits are also minor to others but affect me greatly.  I have lost use my little and ring fingers on both hands. I have diminished grip strength, and have lost the normal range of motion in both wrists.  Feel free to email me with any questions regarding my business plan and expected expenses, or if you need more details about me.  Also, if you are interested, let me know if you want to use my services.</p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>All money I raise will go to funding this business startup. I am looking to do this as a full-time job and career. If I raise my goal, I will start with that money and I can hit the ground running and running hard. If I exceed my goal, I will expand my use of technology and marketing. I will also be able to advertise for new clients.  If for some reason, I don’t reach my funding goals, I will still start this business with the money raised, it will just be proportionally limited.</p><p>My goal is to be on my own and self-sustaining.  I can no longer teach because of my deficits.  I am getting assistance from the VA for all my medical needs; if they are successful in treating me, I would be able to look for a teaching position in a couple of years.  I need to do something now and I really don’t want to languish that long.</p><p>I really don’t have any perks per se. I can tell you, that I am 100% loyal in the way only a veteran can be. If I get this up and running successfully, I would not forget those who helped.  It might be some small token, But I plan on making sure to thank everyone who helped.</p><p>ALL money raised for this will go to this. If I don’t reach my goal, I will simply start in some diminished manner.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>I am not ‘reinventing the wheel’ in any way. What I am doing is trying to come up with a marketing program that will provide lists of interested and motivated potential buyers of services and goods.  Typically for every 1000 names on a list, fewer than 10 of them become paying clients.  What I plan to do is to increase that number from about 1% to closer to 3 or 4%,  or more.  I plan on spreading my expenses over the same types of markets, but to have differing levels or segments as clients to best make use of the results I get.   I do have some understanding of insurance law from experience.  I know that there are restrictions that cross state lines and that there are restrictions how captive brokers, wealth and asset managers, and financial traders can advertise.  I know how to navigate those laws from experience. I therefore also become an arm’s length provider of interested and potential customers for my clients to call and market.  I will not make those sales. I will provide lists of interested potential customers to my clients so that those clients can improve their respective businesses.</p><p>The monies I raise here will help get access to new computers and monitors, sales and marketing programs, software that will help me generate interest, software to better organize data and transmit that data to my new clients, pay for marketing campaigns, pay for advertising and help me acquire new business.  I successfully did similar marketing ideas and campaigns for new members when I ran a Boy Scout Venture Crew. Since then, It has become easier to do using social media and email platforms. Now I will be doing this professionally and will be looking to make an income using this methodology.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>I am in no way a ‘new and unique’ method of advertising.  This industry is populated with large and small competitors.  I can compete because I have low operating requirements once I am in motion.  There is a risk of loss.  I believe that others have successfully done this in other areas of the country and my own experiences show that the potential is both real and attainable for success.  The hardest part will be getting the numbers of clients I can service.</p><p>I will start developing insurance and stock trading leads as soon as I can. As I do that, I will also start looking for clients. I will look to start in NJ first.  As soon as I get a second client in NJ, I will start looking for clients in NY as well.  I will focus on those 2 areas until I have either exhausted my potential client base or retained about 4 clients in each state. From there, I will look to add CT and then PA after.  My goal is 4 insurance brokers in each state, 2-4 wealth managers or investors in each state and then I will look to expand to other types of potential clients.</p><p>I will use the same tools used to generate leads and interest to generate clients for myself. In each case, I will look to sit down with each potential client to best understand their specific target markets.  Then I will create the campaigns needed to generate the leads for each of my clients.</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>I need all the help I can get.</p><p>If you can’t help, but know someone who might, please connect them to my page. Let me know you do that via email at <a href=""mailto:gerald.k.kollath@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gerald.k.kollath@gmail.com</a>.  Until I am up and running, I can’t promise any perks, but I hope to be successful enough that I will make everyone know I appreciate the help. </p><p>Don’t forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p></div>","Short SummaryMy goal is to do much of the legwork for my clients.  If everything works well, I am looking to generate about 3-6% more conversions than typical market advertising.

If I get this up and running successfully, I would not forget those who helped.  It might be some small token, But I plan on making sure to thank everyone who helped.ALL money raised for this will go to this. If I don’t reach my goal, I will simply start in some diminished manner.The ImpactI am not ‘reinventing the wheel’ in any way. What I am doing is trying to come up with a marketing program that will provide lists of interested and motivated potential buyers of services and goods.  Typically for every 1000 names on a list, fewer than 10 of them become paying clients.  What I plan to do is to increase that number from about 1% to closer to 3 or 4%,  or more.  I plan on spreading my expenses over the same types of markets, but to have differing levels or segments as clients to best make use of the results I get.   I do have some understanding of insurance law from experience.  I know that there are restrictions that cross state lines and that there are restrictions how captive brokers, wealth and asset managers, and financial traders can advertise.  I know how to navigate those laws from experience. I therefore also become an arm’s length provider of interested and potential customers for my clients to call and market.  I will not make those sales. I will provide lists of interested potential customers to my clients so that those clients can improve their respective businesses.The monies I raise here will help get access to new computers and monitors, sales and marketing programs, software that will help me generate interest, software to better organize data and transmit that data to my new clients, pay for marketing campaigns, pay for advertising and help me acquire new business.  I successfully did similar marketing ideas and campaigns for new members when I ran a Boy Scout Venture Crew. Since then, It has become easier to do using social media and email platforms. Now I will be doing this professionally and will be looking to make an income using this methodology.Risks & ChallengesI am in no way a ‘new and unique’ method of advertising.  This industry is populated with large and small competitors.  I can compete because I have low operating requirements once I am in motion.  There is a risk of loss.  I believe that others have successfully done this in other areas of the country and my own experiences show that the potential is both real and attainable for success.  The hardest part will be getting the numbers of clients I can service.I will start developing insurance and stock trading leads as soon as I can. As I do that, I will also start looking for clients. I will look to start in NJ first.  As soon as I get a second client in NJ, I will start looking for clients in NY as well.  I will focus on those 2 areas until I have either exhausted my potential client base or retained about 4 clients in each state. From there, I will look to add CT and then PA after.  My goal is 4 insurance brokers in each state, 2-4 wealth managers or investors in each state and then I will look to expand to other types of potential clients.I will use the same tools used to generate leads and interest to generate clients for myself. In each case, I will look to sit down with each potential client to best understand their specific target markets.  Then I will create the campaigns needed to generate the leads for each of my clients.Other Ways You Can HelpI need all the help I can get.If you can’t help, but know someone who might, please connect them to my page. Let me know you do that via email at gerald.k.kollath@gmail.com.  Until I am up and running, I can’t promise any perks, but I hope to be successful enough that I will make everyone know I appreciate the help. Don’t forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>How we invented SIGMO?</h1>
<p>We travel a lot and understand frequent language barriers. It is very inconvenient to carry a large translation books and type out constant words to communicate. Therefore we have developed such voice translation device that becomes more useful! No need for expensive translation services anymore. Portable, intuitive to use and functional. We just need your assistance now in realising our idea and getting SIGMO into production and profitability!</p>

<h1>What do we need funds for? </h1>
<p>Today we have developed several options, prototypes and promotional videos to present the latest version of our working prototype. We still have to improve an application through which SIGMO will operate with your mobile device and finalize the model of SIGMO in order to put it into mass production.</p>
<p>Schedule of execution phase (if our project will succeed):</p>
<p>1st month – finalizing the phone application, integration testing of final prototype versions</p>
<p>2nd month – development/testing of first production versions.</p>
<p>3rd month – final tests and product certification</p>
<p>4th month – manufacture the first batch for mass production.</p>
<p>5th month – delivery of SIGMO to you our backers.</p>
<p>Schedule of execution phase is set with reserve, because we do not want to let down our backers and eliminate possibility of delay on every stage.</p>
<p>We expect to launch SIGMO into mass production and our backers will be able to get new device much earlier and cheaper than those who will want to buy it in future.</p>
<p><strong>Our functional prototype</strong> does everything the final SIGMO version will do.</p>

<h1>Who we are?</h1>
<p>David Barnett and Marti Karrer are friends from childhood. Whilst on vacation, we got an idea to create SIGMO. So now we are working full time on this project after resigning our jobs to commit our entire time to our business.</p>
<p>Marti – is a technology design-engineer who has already created some key advances in electronics and software engineering. Constantly involved in development and innovation over the past 3 years. David – is an entrepreneur with the experience in international trade and development. We have united our efforts to create a product, which will really assist people quickly, cheaply and accurately. Katarina Rauche – is a person full of creativity and inexhaustible energy. She is the one who designed SIGMO’s case and was engaged in our video and photo production.</p>
<h1>Risks and Challenges</h1>
<p>While working in the field of international trade, design and engineering, beside experience in managing business, we have also established close relations with suppliers and manufacturers whom we will need for implementation of our project. During cooperation with them, we became sure about their competence and professionalism. They, as well as we, will do everything to ensure timely development and delivery of “SIGMO”. <br/>We have relations with a company involved in global deliveries and having storage facilities all over the world, which will make it possible for us deliver “SIGMO” to our backers to any place in the world within established time. <br/>We believe that the biggest barrier is ensuring a possibility of downloading a voice vocabulary and using it in off-line mode. We want to be as open to our backers as possible and we will inform them about each step on the way towards realization of the project.</p>
<h1>THANK YOU!</h1>
<p>We would like to thank every backer for any contribution and any assistance in the realization of our project. Share our concept of translation of SIGMO amongst friends and relatives in Facebook and Twitter and together we will bring SIGMO to life!</p>

Sigmo Innovative Technologies


Beside the development of our translation device that allows people to communicate we also have 2 important aims that we're working on:
1. Offline Translation. We are working on offline translation service that will give people an ability to download vocabularies into mobile and to communicate with others without internet connection. No one can do that right now and we want to be first among the others who will provide such function to our consumers.
2. Smart Translating Technology. It will allow to get not just an ordinary translation, but to translate the meaning the phrase you said. That is a unique technology that will make a huge step in translating and international communication. 
All updates, improvements and innovative technologies that will be introduced overtime will be absolutely free of charge for all Sigmo users. All you will need is just to update the App in mobile.




You need SIGMO

Forget about the language barrier

SIGMO allows real-time translating of 25 languages. It has two modes of voice translation. You just simply set your native language, then the language to translate to. By pressing the first button and speaking your phrase SIGMO in turn will instantly translate and pronounce it in a language you have selected. By pressing second button, SIGMO will translate speech from the foreign language, then instantly speak in your native language! All at the press of a button!





Portable

Because of its small, light size, you will be able to take “SIGMO” without any problems on any trip, hanging it around your neck, attaching it to your clothes, belt or strap on your arm with its own special attachment.
Ideal for:

Vacations abroad
Business negotiations with foreigners
Personal meetings
Business trips
Foreign language learning 
Any other situation






Additional Sigmo features:


1. You can use Sigmo as handsfree. As it has the microphone and the speaker you can set incoming calls to Sigmo. It's so easy as using an ordinary bluetooth garniture.
2. Siri Voice Assistant. You can activate Siri on your iPhone or iPad for managing, making calls, writing sms and using other additional Siri functions. For activating Siri you just need to hold the repeat button on Sigmo device.
For more information about Siri services visit: http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/
3. Sigmo has 3.5 mm minijack port for earphones and speakers. Now, with the help of earphones you'll be able to learn foreign languages or listen to the foreign speech without disturbing anyone. Plug Sigmo to the speakers and communicate in foreign languages with the big audience. (Will be available after reaching #2 Stretch Goal $50000).



How does it work?

 Speech translation process

SIGMO operates utilizing your existing mobile phone running Android or IOS operating system (We are planning to add other operating systems). SIGMO connects to the phone with Bluetooth. The translation itself is made through already existing voice translator services (like Google translate). With the help of our free of charge app on your phone, you will be able to change languages for SIGMO. Adjust the volume via app to suit your location, ambient noise levels.


Languages

English (US), English (UK), English (Australia), English (Canada), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (United States), Spanish (Mexico), French (France), French (Canada), Finish, German, Italian, Japanese, Chinese (China), Mandarin and Cantonese(Taiwan / Hong Kong), Catalan, Korean, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Portuguese (Portugal), Portuguese (Brazil), Polish, Russian, Arabic, Indonesian, Hebrew, Czech, Turkish, African, Malay, Croatian, Thai, Greek, Bulgarian, Turkish, Slovak, Hungarian, Ukranian, Hindi.  
Voice translating services are always updating, so the list of languages in SIGMO App will update automatically for free.





Internet connection

All you need is a data connection for “SIGMO” on you mobile phone. “SIGMO” does not require a high speed data connection. Utilising mobile internet with minimal use of traffic. Currently we are working on our biggest barrier - ensuring a possibility of downloading a voice vocabulary and using it in off-line mode.
!!!We believe that our biggest aim is ensuring a possibility of downloading a voice vocabulary and using it in off-line mode!!!



Battery saving

As SIGMO is connected to your mobile phone via Bluetooth which can drain a mobile phones limited battery, so SIGMO app will run in the background mode greatly increasing the batteries life. Battery consumption of your mobile is very low. We estimate the battery life of SIGMO operates 300 hours in stand-by mode and 8 hours in conversation mode. Specifications are not finalised. Technical characteristics may vary during production testing of the final prototype. 


Size and materials

 SIGMO’s case is made from eco-friendly and safe materials.


Translation mistakes

Since voice translators are not always perfect with many accents, they are continually striving to perfect speak recognition software which is constantly improving with every language. But even in this case, though with mistakes, but the meaning of translated speech will remain clear.

To order more than 1 Aluminum Set :



Choose the Perk with multiple Sigmo Sets.


Add $15 for every Aluminum version.



For example: You've ordered 5 Sigmo Sets and your pledge is $180. You want to get 2 ordinary Sigmo sets and 3 Aluminum Sigmo sets. So you have to add 3*$15 = $45 to your existing pledge.






How we invented SIGMO?
We travel a lot and understand frequent language barriers. It is very inconvenient to carry a large translation books and type out constant words to communicate. Therefore we have developed such voice translation device that becomes more useful! No need for expensive translation services anymore. Portable, intuitive to use and functional. We just need your assistance now in realising our idea and getting SIGMO into production and profitability!
First sketches



Our final design
What do we need funds for? 
Today we have developed several options, prototypes and promotional videos to present the latest version of our working prototype. We still have to improve an application through which SIGMO will operate with your mobile device and finalize the model of SIGMO in order to put it into mass production.
Schedule of execution phase (if our project will succeed):
1st month – finalizing the phone application, integration testing of final prototype versions
2nd month – development/testing of first production versions.
3rd month – final tests and product certification
4th month – manufacture the first batch for mass production.
5th month – delivery of SIGMO to you our backers.
Schedule of execution phase is set with reserve, because we do not want to let down our backers and eliminate possibility of delay on every stage.
We expect to launch SIGMO into mass production and our backers will be able to get new device much earlier and cheaper than those who will want to buy it in future.
Our functional prototype does everything the final SIGMO version will do.




Who we are?
David Barnett and Marti Karrer are friends from childhood. Whilst on vacation, we got an idea to create SIGMO. So now we are working full time on this project after resigning our jobs to commit our entire time to our business.
Marti – is a technology design-engineer who has already created some key advances in electronics and software engineering. Constantly involved in development and innovation over the past 3 years. David – is an entrepreneur with the experience in international trade and development. We have united our efforts to create a product, which will really assist people quickly, cheaply and accurately. Katarina Rauche – is a person full of creativity and inexhaustible energy. She is the one who designed SIGMO’s case and was engaged in our video and photo production.
Risks and Challenges
While working in the field of international trade, design and engineering, beside experience in managing business, we have also established close relations with suppliers and manufacturers whom we will need for implementation of our project. During cooperation with them, we became sure about their competence and professionalism. They, as well as we, will do everything to ensure timely development and delivery of “SIGMO”. We have relations with a company involved in global deliveries and having storage facilities all over the world, which will make it possible for us deliver “SIGMO” to our backers to any place in the world within established time. We believe that the biggest barrier is ensuring a possibility of downloading a voice vocabulary and using it in off-line mode. We want to be as open to our backers as possible and we will inform them about each step on the way towards realization of the project.
THANK YOU!
We would like to thank every backer for any contribution and any assistance in the realization of our project. Share our concept of translation of SIGMO amongst friends and relatives in Facebook and Twitter and together we will bring SIGMO to life!

We have worked out many of the logistics challenges and problems.   Most of our manufacturers and vendors are local and a large part of our fabrication is done in house. 
We are confident in this campaign and our ability to deliver.
Mishaps and setback are part of any product, but we pledge to keep you updated about any and all potential delays.

Thank you.

<h2>The DETAILS</h2>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT, EXACTLY?</strong></p>
<p>We're making a database-as-a-platform that aims to collect, collate, and link the reams of data produced by those governing our nation. Then we'll whip up some APIs, drum up some developers (both in-house and freelance), and start making sense of it.</p>
<p>In practice, this is has resulted in a mostly-complete database of California legislators  and legislation since 1993, and <em>that</em> has resulted in those ""Legislative Word Clouds"". We think they're really cool. Surprisingly cool, actually - they turned out way more interesting than we expected.</p>
<p>We've also got <em>most</em> of the elected positions in California back to 1996, but we need a designer to show it off, and we need the rest of the data.</p>
<p>So far, we've only been going after the ""low-hanging fruit' - and not even all of it. To get <em>all</em> the fruit - which, to drop the metaphor - first means <em>all</em> the election information of California - we need more people.</p>
<h3>WE NEED...</h3>
<p><strong>Designers</strong>, <strong>interns</strong>, and <strong>programmers </strong>- We need<strong> money to hire </strong>or<strong> donated services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Designers </strong>to show off the data. The word clouds are beautiful, but they're just the tip of the iceberg. Our greatest need is for a great website front-end, to show the as-yet-unseen contents of the IPDb.<strong> We also need a logo!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interns </strong>will add to the database. This involves a lot of phone calls, but thankfully, not a lot of typing - we've got some great in-house tools to turn gathered records into database data - we know <em>exactly</em> what needs to be done, we just need the people to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Programmers</strong> because everything else is is easier, faster, and usually only possible after the engineers have gotten to it. APIs, better tools, faster code, new data pipelines...</p>

This is a fully automatic Minigun, constructed according to the Gatling Machine Gun Principle. The body is made from wood cut out on the CNC machine. Its ammo consists of 144 shots of rubber bands. With this Rubber Band Minigun anyone can feel like Rambo, launching a rubber storm, and throwing over a pound of rubber bands at the opponent!
 

 
We have prepared 2 versions of the minigun - Assembled and KIT. They are also available in 2 colors.
 
 
 
If you are tearing straight into battle, then this version is for you! Assembled Minigun is ready for action. After all, there is no time for hitches on the office battlefield!

144 shots
12 barrels
Comes in carton box


 

 
This version is painted in several layers with black water-based acrylic paint which has no smell, is not harmful in any way and is used to paint toys. All parts are painted with spray guns by professional painters.

Do you like to assemble things yourself or do you know such a person who always crafts something? We share your passion! Therefore, we developed the KIT version of the Mingun.
 

 
 

 
 

 
This is the best and most affordable Rubber Band Minigun on the market. Its main feature is a specially designed mechanism that allows you to charge it in a matter of minutes. You can assemble it with kids, use it as cosplay, and it's an ultimate gift.
The most advanced mechanism on the market that will allow you to quickly load your Minigun.
How to load? Put. Stretch. Click. That's it!
 
The design of the Rubber Band Minigun allows you to rotate the drum idle (even without loaded rubber bands) which allows you to impress others. Press the trigger to rotate the drum, and then press pusher to release rubber bands in flight. You can shoot single shots, saving ammunition and conduct aimed fire, or release an entire flurry of rubber bands at your opponent.",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

What’s yours?  In our hectic modern world, personal organization and productivity are a struggle. We often feel busy, but are we really productive? Finding time for you and your projects can feel nearly impossible. Fortunately, we have a tool to help you do exactly that. Introducing the Magna Planner, a one-of-a-kind goal planner to give life to your dream and keep you motivated along the way.   The Magna Planner’s unique structure keenly balances daily life with long-term intentions so that goal-setting and day-planning become systematic. This isn’t just another generic personal organizer.  Inspired by great achievers, supported by tested methods, and built to counteract today’s distractions, the Magna Planner is a tool to help you stay focused, cultivate self-awareness, and develop a lifestyle of growing personally and living intentionally.Writing in a paper planner engages the memory and leads you to plan more mindfully. Research shows that writing things down by hand helps you retain information better, especially when you're not relying on a phone notification to remind you of a deadline or appointment. You can keep everything in one place, rather than opening and closing multiple apps, fighting the constant temptation of distracting notifications.    Our meticulously designed system is built to keep your goal at the forefront of your mind, making sure you always stay on task. 
 A paper planner - Writing in a paper planner engages the memory, limits technology distractions, and holds you accountable. 
 Undated and Quarterly  - Each planner includes three undated months so you can start anytime. At less than 11 ounces, it's easy to carry with you. 

 Quick Start Guide - Get a crash course on the whole system so you can jump in right away. 
 Comprehensive Instructional Guide - Learn more about the best ways to apply each element, ensuring you get the most out of your planner. 
 Goal Mapping Workbook Section - Clearly defining your goals is key to realizing your dream. You have to know what you want before you can have it!  Breaking your project down into specific, actionable steps will help get you there sooner by giving you a clear roadmap to follow. 
 4 Month Calendar Views (In case you start your planner in the middle of a month) - Plan trips, track events and holidays. See your Magna Goal timeline for the quarter. 
 13 Weekly Spreads  - With 6 pages for every week, there's plenty of space to plan and reflect, but not so much that you spend too much time planning and not enough time acting. (Details below)
 Praxis Discipline Building - Praxis is the practical application of an idea. Learn to build foundational habits and routines that last to support your goals.
 Quarterly Review - Continually calibrate your goals and learn from yourself. Ensure you are challenging yourself just the right amount. 

 Extra Notes Pages -  Collect spur of the moment insights, flesh out ideas, or curate long-term lists without carrying around a second journal. 
 Each Magna Planner is made from high-quality and environmentally-friendly materials for on-the-go planning, ensuring it will last until your project is complete. Our Manufacturer is also a proud sponsor of Trees for the Future.   

      After months of in-depth research, brainstorming sessions, and testing, we’ve broken our system down into four key pillars:  1) Dream with Purpose, 2) Plan with Flexibility, 3) Act with Resolve, 4) Reflect with Humility These pillars orient the elements of our system and lay the foundation for your future success and development. Over the course of numerous projects, we’ve seen the same issues cropping up again and again. The Magna Planner is designed to specifically address each of these, providing longterm solutions for frequent problems: Problem: Lack of discernible growth or progressSolution: Routine Building and Regular Assessments  Track progress on personal disciplines and your Magna Goal. Be intentional about self-improvement by discovering your key motivators, because sometimes, willpower needs good planning.  Praxis is the practical application of an idea. Build sustainable and foundational habits and routines that support your goal. Even our best intentions to follow daily routines and weekly rhythms can fall flat without the right logistics in place. Each quarter you'll choose habits to focus on and apply appropriate incentives or challenges to keep them going.   Large-scale projects can take a while to come to fruition and distant goals can sometimes seem like a fantasy. In the interim, it’s easy to get discouraged. An improperly set goal can zap motivation, leaving you listless or scattered, ensuring you never reach your dreams. The Magna Planner counters this with frequent self-assessment, based on the highly regarded OKR (Objectives and Key Results) system. Thanks to daily, weekly, and quarterly reviews, you can more easily track your achievements and find that sense of accomplishment that will keep you going. The review system is also intentionally designed to help you discover how you work best, making you more productive over the longterm. Continually recalibrate and realign your mission and make sure you're operating in your Magna Zone, feeling capable and challenged. Regular reflection makes you more aware of your own habits and helps you learn from yourself, cultivating discipline and breeding success.   Problem: Losing sight of your driving goalSolution: Weekly Task Lists  With big projects, it’s easy to get caught up in the details. You can quickly find yourself spending too much time on something insignificant and falling behind schedule. Even worse, your motivation gets lost in the shuffle. If you have ever found yourself in this situation, it’s possible you may need to reprioritize.The Magna Planner is unique in how it divides your main goal into weekly organized tasks. It’s structured to help you build a habit of making consistent progress every day. This way, you never lose sight of your dream because it’s a part of your daily life. Track all your actionable items and measure your progress in one comprehensive spread.  Problem: Planning down to the minuteSolution: Time Blocking    No one likes to be micromanaged, so why do we do it with our time? Some productivity tips out there recommend you plan your day in one hour, fifteen, and even five-minute increments. It doesn’t work. You spend more time making plans than you do executing them.With the Magna Planner’s unique system of time blocking, planning should not take longer than a few minutes. This leaves your day more open and flexible in order to better address daily responsibilities or unforeseen circumstances. Problem: Lack of direction or motivationSolution: Mission Statement  We’ve all felt directionless after graduating from school, shifting careers, or entering new life phases like marriage or parenting. The sense of purpose and security you once had is gone. You find yourself with atypical amounts of time and without a clear path forward.The Magna Planner's workbook section leads you through creating a mission-driven goal that guides your day to day routine. By clearly defining your dreams, you can more easily identify precise goals, flesh out the details, and form an effective plan of attack. This will allow you to focus on the impact of your success, helping you stay motivated and avoid excuses.   We’re Gilbert and Cassandra Cardenas, a husband and wife entrepreneurial team passionate about encouraging others to share their gifts. After spending hundreds of hours studying different theories and trying out various organizers, we found nothing quite fit our needs. So, we created our own.Using the Magna Planner, we’ve taken control of our lives - launching new projects, creating better daily routines, and finding a thriving work-life balance. After our success, we decided to share our method.No one should have to delay their dreams. You can make progress and there’s no reason you have to keep feeling stuck. It’s time to stop waiting for other people to give you permission and blaze your own trail. We're here to help and cheer you on, because your gifts are meant to be given.   GIVING BACK After 6 years of active service, transitioning out of the military was extremely difficult.

<h2>Why did we decide to develop the WiTi board?</h2>
<p>    I hope to be able to deploy a reliable and low-power storage server, which is used to host the company’s CMS and git code repositories  instead of the heavy, high energy consumption PC server. Similarly, I also hope that families have their own storage server to share their beautiful music and wonderful pictures and videos anywhere at any time. I have used some of the other storage products before. Although some of them are very good, but none of them can meet my needs. I need a product which can meet my needs and at the same time I can freely modify it . When I saw the specification of MT7621,I felt very excited. I believe I can build a team to develop such an open platform. So people with similar ideas can concentrate on developing the real final products without wasting too much time!</p>

Entainment
 After the widely praised UBook 2-in-1 tablet that we launched in early 2019, there was a demand for a successor to the UBook series. We created exactly what consumers wanted, the fully refined UBook Pro. Utilizing all the benefits of the previous model, we greatly improved UBook in all aspects, rethinking the traditional price/performance ratio of 2-in-1 tablets.1. Breakthrough Performance ImprovementsWe created the UBook to breeze through daily office work while also handling some moderate Adobe programs with high efficiency. With this in mind we decided to adopt the latest generation of Intel’s Core M processors, the m3-8100Y which is the best solution for the UBook Pro. This means we can create a product that not only runs cool, but does so silently with a fanless design.2. Follow The Classic U-shaped KickstandUBook Pro utilizes a new lighter, yet sturdy u-shaped kickstand. This saves space internally, allowing a larger battery and better cooling system, leading to better performance.3. A Screen Built For ProductivityMicrosoft started the 3:2 aspect ratio trend with their Surface Pro series, since then few companies have followed Microsoft’s lead. We find this to be a shame as we believe 3:2 to be the superior format when it comes to productivity on laptops. Compared to 16:9, 3:2 provides a more desirable reading environment, it’s not hard to see the benefits.4. The Ports You NeedUBook Pro is equipped with a vast I/O, featuring 1* DC prot for charing, 2* USB-A, 1* USB-C with support for PD charging, 1* Micro HDMI, 1* 3.5mm headphone jack and a DC input for charging. Additionally, you’ll find a TF card reader and a docking connector. No dongles, no hassle! Remarkable Portability & Lightweight DesignAt just 9mm thick and weighing in at only 780g, you can effortlessly take UBook Pro anywhere you go with absolute ease. The precision CNC milled housing not only makes UBook beautiful, it also fits comfortably in your hands. The Unique “U-Shaped” kickstandWe went to extreme lengths to ensure the UBook Pro would be comfortable and convenient to use while providing an iconic, timeless design. The flexible, ultra-slim U-shaped kickstand allowed us to free up internal space, giving us the ability to install the extremely high performance hardware.With a full 145 degrees of motion, the angled kickstand allows you to switch between laptop, tablet or workstation mode, giving you full control of your workflow. First-class TypingThe redesigned keyboard is treated with a high-performance polyurethane coating to resist spills. In addition, the keyboard is designed with optimal key spacing for fast and fluid typing and a larger glass trackpad for precision control.
  An Head-turning DisplayEquipped with a 12.3 inch IPS FHD display, UBook Pro provides a sharper contrast and gives natural, delicate colors. iPads use a 4:3 aspect ratio, which we found to be too square. MacBooks use 16:10, which we found to be too wide. After much thought and deliberation, we decided to adopt a 3:2 aspect ratio which is far superior and appropriate for use on the Windows operating system. Amazing Fully Laminated TechnologyFeaturing a fully laminated LCD display which can greatly reduce glare to make your pictures even more transparent and colorful - perfect for indoor and outdoor use. 2048 Levels Of Pressure SensitivityAccompanied with the 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity, the HiPen H5 will supercharge your creativity. With palm blocking technology, it has been carefully designed to bring you a truly natural writing experience. Ready For Optimal Performance with an Intel core ProcessorThe incredible Intel Core m3-8100Y processor is produced with 14nm technology, offering 2 cores, 4 threads and a 3.4GHz turbo frequency, it is the best choice for a 2-in-1 convertible device. Backed by the powerful Intel UHD Graphics 615, it can easily support 4K videos and run some 3D games.No matter the task, UBook pro handles it all with ease. Fanless Silent DesignThanks to the excellent hardware layout and Intel’s high performance processor with low power consumption, UBook Pro doesn’t need fans to stay cool, meaning it stays perfectly silent. No more whirring!  Fast Running, Large Capacity With 8GB of LPDDR3 Ram onboard, the UBook Pro offers seamless multitasking and lag free switching between multiple resource hungry program.The 256GB M.2 SATA solid state drive (SSD) performs up to 5 times faster than a traditional hard drive (HDD). This enables rapid boot times, apps launch instantly and larger files open at blazing speeds. All The Ports You NeedDespite the body of UBook Pro being so small, we have never compromised on I/O. The two full sized USB-A ports allow you to connect most peripherals. In addition, connecting to a TV or monitor has never been easier with the inclusion of a micro HDMI port, ideal for presentations, galleries and spreadsheets.To provide a completely future-proof experience, we also included a fully functional USB-C 3.0, capable of 5 gbps transfer speeds that also doubles up as a secondary charging port. What’s more, you can easily connect it to a projector or a hub. Always Stay Powered & Last for 8 hours Endurance is the strength of UBook Pro. The remarkable battery life is achieved with a 38Wh high-density Li-polymer battery and the ultra efficient processor, providing more than 8 hours of battery life; it will never let you down.*Battery test data was obtained from CHUWI Labs.

We're in 2017, how is this still happening?? Not anymore!</p><p>I'm a 3D generalist and technical artist and I'd been waiting for an app that would let me show my work easily without internet and anywhere anytime but it never came, not like I wanted it anyways. So I decided that I must create one myself, one that catters to all my needs and that would let me show off my work in the best way possible, and in the process of thinking about it I thought that I'm probably not the only 3D artist that would love this so I'm making it for all of us. It still needs some work though and even though I love working on this I'm a human that needs to eat and a place to live in order to keep working on it so here I am.</p><h3><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ErikaMoya.a3DMOP"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can use it as of now at this very moment</a></h3><p><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ErikaMoya.a3DMOP"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The alpha version is up in Google Play here</a>.

<p><strong>Long-lasting design</strong></p>
<p>Materials are carefully picked from trusted and sustainable suppliers. These materials are made for the furnishing industry making <strong>FOLDABLE</strong><i>OFFICE</i> a durable, and long-lasting object. The signature <strong>WOOD-SKIN®</strong> textile hinge makes the <strong>FOLDABLE</strong><i>OFFICE</i> a hardware-free object which therefore avoids the annoying brakes and dysfunctions. Ultimately, the design has been conceived as flat and compact, making it easy to store and when you move and change lifestyle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reusability and recyclability</strong></p>
<p>The design has been conceived as flat and compact to go around effortlessly in the house or office. Additionally, during the initial testing of the product, we already discovered more possible uses than the advertised one (such as book holder, mouse pad, etc...) making the object's life longer and customisable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sustainable materials</strong></p>
<p>Materials are very carefully picked from sustainable partners, often using recycled materials such as the coloured MDF or the <strong>ALPI</strong> wood veneer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Environmentally friendly factories</strong></p>
<p>Our factory is located in the north of Italy where laws about environmental processes are strict and very much taken into consideration by us. Our production process is very lean and compact making the footprint minimal. The <strong>WOOD-SKIN®</strong> digital manufacturing process allows us to have minimal production waste which, when present, is used to heat up the factory for the winter. We have always valued the beauty of natural materials and we make sure that our wood comes from certified forests. Since January 2020 we have joined the long list of <strong>FSC®</strong>-certified Italian companies (<strong>FSC®</strong> C154721). The materials we use for the creation of <strong>WOOD-SKIN® </strong>composite come from forests where natural diversity is protected and preserved and the rights of workers and local communities are respected. Contact us to receive the updated list of <strong>FSC®</strong> materials. The <strong>Forest Stewardship Council®</strong> is an international nongovernmental organisation that promotes environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial, and economically viable management of the world’s forests.

<p>We started a collaboration with an Italian firm, supporting farmers who want to plant fruit trees, financing their work in the early years, when the trees are not yet productive. Thanks to <strong>Treedom</strong>, we already have a tiny forest composed of 400 trees, that will grow with us and our projects in the years to come. We have committed to planting 1 tree for every 10m2 of <strong>WOOD-SKIN®</strong> produced for each project.</p>

With a clever design, it transforms in just a few steps, from workstation to space divider. It is realised with beautiful materials, in Italy, via WOOD-SKIN®’s patented manufacturing process.WORKSTATION MODE - Beautiful, easy and practical, in a few steps you can have your work space set up. Pens, pencils and notebooks always within reach. A dedicated space for everything, from your smartphone to the ever essential post-it note.  FUNCTIONAL DIVIDER MODE - It is rather normal to live with other people in the house or having to share your desk at the office. FOLDABLEOFFICE  provides you with a solution to find your focus, thanks to a comfortable corner made with acoustic felt which offers a computer stand, pin-board, and more.  





  Elevate your laptop to avoid overheating and improve posture. Healthier posture for a better life. LAPTOP STAND FLAPS - The flaps are an important key feature, giving you the comfort of keeping your laptop secure and in place whilst also allowing the FOLDABLE OFFICE to hold  laptops of varying sizes.


FOLDABLEOFFICE will make moving between meetings, or from one room to another a pleasure. Find your privacy bringing everything with you with ease thanks to the handles on the side and the tray inspired design.
 

 
                   
               

 

At home  

Working from home with all the necessary.
 

If you don't feel sharing dinner with the rest of the family.
 
At the office 

Find your space in an open desk or move with ease during a back to back meeting day.
 

Erika on the right is keeping her back straight and her desk tidy, can't say the same of Sirio in front of her…That walnut veneer on the blue desk! Looking great
 

We know the future is going to be different, at WOOD-SKIN we believe the most important thing it is to empower everyone with the right tools to excel, and find your very own perfect balance between work/life/study.

Bookstand

 
With mouse and keyboard 


Comfortably working with your mouse and keyboard.
 

The FOLDABLEOFFICE is made with premium materials ideal to be clean frequently, keep it at home to create your own super-productive workspace, or bring it at home to make sure you can move easily between meetings with all your stuff. The teenager homeschooling, the freelancer spending the day in a cafe, or the mom finally taking that french class she wanted to for a long time. The FOLDABLEOFFICE  has been designed with an open mind and for open use. Super intuitive use, designed for all ages.
 


It really just takes SECONDS, the WOOD-SKIN® technology allows us to embed very resistant textile hinges within the rigid materials so to offer a sturdy design that you can fold thousands of times.
 

 
Custom sized bag

We have created a custom carry canvas bag in organic cotton to take your own FOLDABLEOFFICE with you wherever you go. With a weight of 2,2 kg and its ultra-slim design, it is very easy to walk to the office with it or put it in the car for a week of remote working.



 

You can choose among Indian Rosewood/Planked Oak/Smoke Grey/Cherry Blush veneers and Black laminate finishes with a touch of yellow/green/blue MDF base material.


The interior layer uses a thick grey recycled synthetic felt providing comfortable acoustic properties.
 

 

Indestructible

We had fun testing it first with beta users and friends, here you can see an angry stress test of the final version with weights well above 3kg (more than double a normal laptop).
 

We are glad to give you the possibility to customise your FOLDABLEOFFICE.  Add a personal touch or a special message with a free of charge engraving for Double, Business, and Enterprise packs. We will produce and engrave personally your piece in our factory near Milan.

Purchase of a double-pack allows you name engraving.
Purchase of a business-pack allows you logo engraving with text/name in two different spots:

The large area on the left will be more visible in the FUNCTIONAL DIVIDER MODE while the smaller engraving spot on the right will be the only one visible with the FOLDABLEOFFICE  in WORKSTATION MODE.
 


 
The WOOD-SKIN INSIDE team is a group of talented designers within our company, this thinks thank job it is to help brands easily integrate the WOOD-SKIN® signature textile hinge into their products. From years of experience developing origami products with top firms such as Zaha Hadid Architects, the MIT self-assembly lab, BMW, Pininfarina, and more we have decided to come up with a product for everybody, starting from our own needs during the recent forced periods of working from home we developed a solution able to help you juggle this fluid and ever-changing work life.

Thanks to our in-house built software, we can control seamlessly 3D complex surfaces and their direct 2D transposition.

 
WOOD-SKIN®
WOOD-SKIN® was founded in 2013 in Milan to help architects and designers around the world bridge the gap between digital representation and architectural feasibility. The patented WOOD-SKIN® process makes rigid surfaces flexible and flat surfaces three-dimensional, giving volume, dynamism and ""soul"" to a multitude of materials that industry and technology have traditionally relegated to the two-dimensional state. We are a heterogeneous company made up of architects, designers and engineers united by a shared passion and a particular attention to materials, details, digital manufacturing and software.

FOLDABLE OFFICE is currently in production phase.
After a successful campaign on Kickstarter we have started producing the first pieces. We are really proud that we are keeping faith to our production plan and that our first pieces are turning out great

 

We have undergone extensive product comparison work with the current market, listing the important features where FOLDABLEOFFICE excels to enable you to make the best choice:

The FOLDABLEOFFICE is at a very advanced stage of development. The current prototypes, at their third iteration, are fully working in all the required features. Onto of that, every single component of the FOLDABLEOFFICE is made in-house and through a process that has been already performed numerous times by the WOOD-SKIN® team.

Long-lasting design
Materials are carefully picked from trusted and sustainable suppliers. These materials are made for the furnishing industry making FOLDABLEOFFICE a durable, and long-lasting object. The signature WOOD-SKIN® textile hinge makes the FOLDABLEOFFICE a hardware-free object which therefore avoids the annoying brakes and dysfunctions. Ultimately, the design has been conceived as flat and compact, making it easy to store and when you move and change lifestyle.
 
Reusability and recyclability
The design has been conceived as flat and compact to go around effortlessly in the house or office. Additionally, during the initial testing of the product, we already discovered more possible uses than the advertised one (such as book holder, mouse pad, etc...) making the object's life longer and customisable.
 
Sustainable materials
Materials are very carefully picked from sustainable partners, often using recycled materials such as the coloured MDF or the ALPI wood veneer.
 
Environmentally friendly factories
Our factory is located in the north of Italy where laws about environmental processes are strict and very much taken into consideration by us. Our production process is very lean and compact making the footprint minimal. The WOOD-SKIN® digital manufacturing process allows us to have minimal production waste which, when present, is used to heat up the factory for the winter. We have always valued the beauty of natural materials and we make sure that our wood comes from certified forests. Since January 2020 we have joined the long list of FSC®-certified Italian companies (FSC® C154721). The materials we use for the creation of WOOD-SKIN® composite come from forests where natural diversity is protected and preserved and the rights of workers and local communities are respected. Contact us to receive the updated list of FSC® materials. The Forest Stewardship Council® is an international nongovernmental organisation that promotes environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial, and economically viable management of the world’s forests. To learn more, visit www.fsc.org
 
Sustainable Distribution
We prioritise shipping companies with solid environmental plans, choosing to package exclusively in recycled materials.
 



We started a collaboration with an Italian firm, supporting farmers who want to plant fruit trees, financing their work in the early years, when the trees are not yet productive. Thanks to Treedom, we already have a tiny forest composed of 400 trees, that will grow with us and our projects in the years to come. We have committed to planting 1 tree for every 10m2 of WOOD-SKIN® produced for each project.",89.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why are we crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>Some people told us that a small start-up could not possibly build their own search engine - it wouldn't work, it would take many years, it would cost tens of millions ... some have even laughed out loud at the idea!  However, we worked exclusively with people that believe in us, and we have been able to create a better search engine that is ready to be shared.

<li>alternative platforms for hosting advertisement pools</li>
<li>a flexible and reliable <a href=""https://github.com/StackMonkey/Bonsho"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blockchain payment monitoring tool</a>
</li>
<li>payment instances to manage auto-payments for deployments</li>

</li>
<li>decentralized SSL tunnel hosted on appliances for instance access </li>
<li>numerous features related to security and reliability</li>
</ul>
<p>Support will also continue to be provided via community driven content, email support and contract work for entities wishing to deploy federated compute on their infrastructures.  New feature requests will be considered for special deployments.</p>
<p>With funding, Utter.io sets a goal of adding over 100 providers in 30 countries to the StackMonkey pool next year.</p>

<p>Physical rewards like stickers and t-shirts will be shipped using economy class shipping. We'll need to collect things like shipping address and shirt sizes from you.</p>
<p>Account rewards like priority support and early access features will be done via a tokenized page on the website.  Please note that verifying your identity will be required when you collect the rewards!  If you are privacy sensitive, you may wish to simply contribute a custom amount to the project at the lowest reward level.</p>
<p>The developer off-site is intended for developers only.  Ideally you are skilled in a wide array of infrastructure technologies and can contribute through architecture and/or coding.  If you'd like to purchase the development offsite for someone who might be interested, but can't afford it, we're more than happy to make arrangements for them.</p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Post Funding</h3>
<div>
<p>If we are funded, StackMonkey and the Utter.io framework will have their IP assigned to a non-profit foundation to encourage continued innovation in development and expansion of network services.</p>
<p>The minimum viable funding for the project has been determined to be US$49,000. This amount will allow for the two existing full time developers to continue working on the project for the next six months. </p>
<p>If funding is over-goal, or we manage to raise more funding in another manner, I will use the amount to help forecast a budget for the foundation to use to hire additional developers.  Ideally we'd like a team of 6-7 people working on this full time, with a minimum of a year's burn available.  That puts the funds needed for payroll at about US$1M, given they were located in the Bay (assuming they worked on a discount, sadly enough).</p>
<p>Given we're looking for efficiencies, we have decided it would be good idea to decentralize the team. This lowers living costs, allows for a wider range of skill choices, and provides a good life/work balance for the developers. We're planning on doing a foundation offsite every 4 months or so to ensure good execution on planning and helping build relationships.</p>
<p>Opportunities are likely to exist in the future for raising venture capital for offerings based on top of the framework. After the foundation is well established, other developers and I may choose to become a part of efforts to produce commercial opportunities from the platform/network.  </p>
<p>There may also be an opportunity to do a crypto IPO for the project, which would eclipse the need to do a traditional fund raise for a commercial offering.</p>
</div>
<h3>Foundation Basics</h3>
<div>
<p>The foundation will raise money for development through a variety of means, including well defined and transparent corporate sponsored donations, conferences, schwag, feature bounties and more.</p>
<p>The Utter.io Foundation will be self-governed and driven exclusively by user and developer participation.  Corporate interests will remain important, especially when considering their contribution to compute resources, but their impact and relationship with the system must remain transparent at all times. Remember, infrastructure was meant to be open, transparent and trustworthy!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Utter.io is an Open Source software platform which uses cryptocurrency technologies to allow users to buy and provision virtual servers.  The platform also enables OpenStack operators to form compute cooperatives using a virtual appliance, allowing fast scaling and sharing of excess compute resources between trusted entities. This concept may be one possible solution to the challenges associated with achieving a globally federated cloud.

Virtual servers for sale are advertised by the appliances on a compute pool. Purchases are done by sending Bitcoin to an address that corresponds to the size and type of instance needed by the user. The screenshot below shows a BItcoin payment address corresponding to an instance ready to be started by an Utter.io virtual appliance running on an account on HPCloud's Las Vegas datacenter.


The StackMonkey pool is the first of many cooperatives, and is intended to be the Wild West of compute pools. The pool is built for use by hackers, crackers, security researchers, developers, do-it-yourselfers, and the communities and technologies developed from their use of the system.
Users wishing to launch decentralized software services such as DarkMail, OpenBazaar, Freenet, Tor, MaidSafe, Ethereum and more can start instances with pseudonymity on the coop's deployments, or smaller privately run cloud deployments. No accounts are needed to launch instances!
All code providing basic infrastructure services to the project will be Open Source and will be licensed under the MIT License.
  

Learn More About the Vision 
If you are interested in learning more about the Utter.io vision, check out the longer-winded video below. I go through the history and future of the cloud, talk about the trust the blockchain brings us and how a computed trust based cloud gives us a path to a globally federated cloud anyone can use by simply clicking and paying.
The distributed cloud paper I refer to in the video can be found here.


Now you know why I had to build my own teleprompter for the 3 minute version: I talk a lot.
Also, be sure to read Code of Trust, a blog post I wrote last year. It explains why our trust in cloud technologies remains a challenge for infrastructure architecture today.
If you are interested in seeing the technology in action, check out the video my daughter Lily and I did doing a demo of Utter.io's features on StackMonkey.
If we are successfully funded, a non-profit foundation will be established to manage the project and help establish a user-centric community for raising awareness and continued project development.   Development Timeline 
The project is currently in beta, hosted on hosted on Github and is 100% Open Source. An instance of the pool controller is currently running at StackMonkey, and is hosted on Google AppEngine. The beta launched in October.
The appliance is generally available for use by following simple instructions to install from Github. 
Users can set prices for the compute they wish to sell by configuring their local copy of the appliance. The image below demonstrates the setup of the appliance.


Development over the next two quarters will focus on the decentralization of key services inside the framework, including:

alternative platforms for hosting advertisement pools
a flexible and reliable blockchain payment monitoring tool

payment instances to manage auto-payments for deployments
server/service authentication via bitcoin keys using bitauth/bitid

decentralized SSL tunnel hosted on appliances for instance access 
numerous features related to security and reliability

Support will also continue to be provided via community driven content, email support and contract work for entities wishing to deploy federated compute on their infrastructures.  New feature requests will be considered for special deployments.
With funding, Utter.io sets a goal of adding over 100 providers in 30 countries to the StackMonkey pool next year.
Rewards

Physical rewards like stickers and t-shirts will be shipped using economy class shipping. We'll need to collect things like shipping address and shirt sizes from you.
Account rewards like priority support and early access features will be done via a tokenized page on the website.  Please note that verifying your identity will be required when you collect the rewards!  If you are privacy sensitive, you may wish to simply contribute a custom amount to the project at the lowest reward level.
The developer off-site is intended for developers only.  Ideally you are skilled in a wide array of infrastructure technologies and can contribute through architecture and/or coding.  If you'd like to purchase the development offsite for someone who might be interested, but can't afford it, we're more than happy to make arrangements for them.


    Post Funding

If we are funded, StackMonkey and the Utter.io framework will have their IP assigned to a non-profit foundation to encourage continued innovation in development and expansion of network services.
The minimum viable funding for the project has been determined to be US$49,000. This amount will allow for the two existing full time developers to continue working on the project for the next six months. 
If funding is over-goal, or we manage to raise more funding in another manner, I will use the amount to help forecast a budget for the foundation to use to hire additional developers.  Ideally we'd like a team of 6-7 people working on this full time, with a minimum of a year's burn available.  That puts the funds needed for payroll at about US$1M, given they were located in the Bay (assuming they worked on a discount, sadly enough).
Given we're looking for efficiencies, we have decided it would be good idea to decentralize the team. This lowers living costs, allows for a wider range of skill choices, and provides a good life/work balance for the developers. We're planning on doing a foundation offsite every 4 months or so to ensure good execution on planning and helping build relationships.
Opportunities are likely to exist in the future for raising venture capital for offerings based on top of the framework. After the foundation is well established, other developers and I may choose to become a part of efforts to produce commercial opportunities from the platform/network.  
There may also be an opportunity to do a crypto IPO for the project, which would eclipse the need to do a traditional fund raise for a commercial offering.

Foundation Basics

The foundation will raise money for development through a variety of means, including well defined and transparent corporate sponsored donations, conferences, schwag, feature bounties and more.
The Utter.io Foundation will be self-governed and driven exclusively by user and developer participation.  Corporate interests will remain important, especially when considering their contribution to compute resources, but their impact and relationship with the system must remain transparent at all times. Remember, infrastructure was meant to be open, transparent and trustworthy!

The Team
Kord Campbell

I'm originally from Oklahoma. I love creating obscure branding memes and frequently dream about the future of compute. I'm dedicated to developer-centric approaches to marketing products, as I am a developer myself. I code in Python and JavaScript, but I've also been known to write C code for my Arduino.


I exited Grub to LookSmart in 2003 (my first visit to the Bay) and did a few other startups before moving back and becoming the Chief Evangelist at Splunk in 2007, where I founded the first Splunk devops conference. In 2009, I founded Loggly and served as the CEO there until 2012. I left the company after coming to an impasse with the board about its future.
I'm thankful for the time I've had over the last 2 1/2 years. I've spent most of it focusing on improving my coding skills, doing a bit of OpenStack consulting and thinking about how to apply cryptocurrency trust to the cloud. I also authored and maintain a set of install scripts which have helped about 15K people install OpenStack for evaluation purposes.
There is more information about me in my profile and on LinkedIn.  You can find me on Twitter,Github and a couple of blogs I scribble in from time to time.

I confess that I wore a pair of house shoes while filming the main video. :)

Thank you in advance for all your support.</p><br/></div>","Our vision is to change the way you think about tools.What is 3DSimo mini better in compared to other 3D pens: Not only is it smaller and smarter, but thanks to interchangeable extensions it also allows the user to use more features. Look at all the benefits below.Be the ultimate creator. Create jewelry, figures,accessories, decorations, artwork and so much more. You can even fix any plastic items. As in classic 3D printer technology, molten plastic is extruded from the die and cools down rapidly. It is therefore possible to draw solid structures in the air. There are no material limitations due to adjustable temperature and speed.Become an acclaimed artist. Express your creativity and start to change things around. Want to decorate a wooden cutting board, spoon or rolling pin? No problem! Turn an old belt, pair of shoes, or jacket into unique fashion piece with your personal touch. Transform it into a unique fashion accessory. You may even start an online shop with custom-made accessories! This extension can also be used for the treatment of 3D printed models and their smoothing, making your creations truly flawless.For the engineer within you. You no longer need to buy an expensive adjustable soldering station. 3DSimo mini handles this function, heating up the tip under 10 seconds to an incredible 490°C, while still being safe to handle. Now you yourself can repair a torn USB cable, damaged earphones, or start creating your own electrical equipment.Shape out anything you want. With this extension, your imagination becomes the limit. Intended primarily for designers, modelers and architects, you can now create functional RC models (aircraft, boats, cars), buildings, art objects and so much more. If you own a 3D printer, you know how difficult it is to remove the support, and 3DSimo mini will help you with this as well. Create them from polystyrene, plexiglas, balsa wood or foam.The 3DSimo mobile app gives you control over the temperature and speed so you can work with different and sometimes totally new materials. The FREE Android,Windows and iOS app connects to your Mini via Bluetooth. The 3DSimo app allows you to adjust the temperature, speed and different material profiles with precision. The app will also provide you with instructional videos, templates to print and regular software updates.Power pack - 3DSimo mini can be used via an adapter with a cable included in the basic package. But when you head for the countryside or don't want to be limited by a cable, connect the power pack. The power pack is a battery with electronics for the proper powering of the 3DSimo mini.  What if your glasses break in nature, the tent tears, or you're simply not able to light a fire? The 3DSimo mini with connected power pack will help you. You can also charge a cell phone, MP3 or flashlight anywhere. The power pack can continuously power the 3DSimo mini for 60 to 90 min.It all began a year ago with our first product 3DSimo which we managed to put on the market despite very limited financial resources. This gave us a clearer idea and a valuable experience on the steps between a simple idea and the finished commercial product. Learning from our last experience, we decided to cooperate with experienced graphic designers, mechanical engineers, electronic engineers, IT professionals and programmers to help us refine and develop the 3DSimo Mini.3Dsimo is assembled in our factory in Czech Republic, in the very hearth of Europe. Here are a few photos of the original 3Dsimo, which we have been manufacturing for more than one year now. And though manufacturing the same thing over and over again helped us to perfect the process, we believe it’s time for a change. With your help, we will be able to start assembling 3Dsimo mini in few months.Thanks to adjustable speed and temperature, you are not limited by the material you use. You can choose different materials and actually use materials that will come to the market in the future! Makers can use any standard 1.75 mm filament.Skilled, passionate and sometimes both. We are a group of 3Dprinting enthusiasts, engineers, artists.3Dsimo mini is fully functional and ready for mass production. During the campaign we will keep you updated on the progress.

It takes email, adds simplicity of direct messages and turns both into one smart and smooth experience. It filters out the noise and leaves on the voices that are important to you.The idea is that on the go, we have context on a timeline: of people and topics that are important to us: at school, with work, with friends, planning events, or with family and life partners.Our priorities change depending no where we are and what we are doing. We want to stay in touch with people, get updates, send them our thoughts, ideas and wishes. But we don’t want to manage emails. We don’t want to be bugged with newsletters. We want to talk about what is important to us at the time, at school, with work, family, or on events.Cate is about communication that is simple and straightforward. We use technology to remove clutter, to take care of a lot of things that are disrupting us and slowing us down. Cate provides a flawless, smooth experience, so you can focus on communication.Cate unifies email and direct messaging into a new, innovative experience. It ties in with services like Gmail and Twitter, Facebook Chat or App.net for direct messages. Cate does not replace these services, but it improves how you use them. You can always access and manage your conversations using Web Gmail, other email apps, or direct messaging app services.Cate got its name from communicate. It is planned as a mobile app for iOS and Android. There will also be a Web or desktop app that is more designed for managing messages. It will let you sort, delete, manage and group messages and set up filters. Cate has a very smart architecture, that allows us to relay and distribute messages so you get a unified and simplified experience.We have plans and ideas that go much further, to offer pro accounts and collaboration tools, encryption and more space, for groups on an enterprise level. But we will take one step at a time. First we want to find the best way to communicate with text on the go.Cate will be made by River, a start-up with a focus on tools that make our lives better, that help us communicate, think, collect knowledge, collaborate and live together. We are young and Cate will be our first major release.River was founded by Henning von Vogelsang and Freddy Snijder joined the team as Engineering advisor.As a first step, we are building the foundation. This is where we need your help. We have an innovative product idea, product design, a user interface, concepts and ideas for algorithms and access to technologies to make this work.There needs to be a backend (software on servers) and a frontend (software on your devices). We will begin with iOS development, but from the start we will lay out the foundation for the technology we need to make Cate a platform for the future.This work requires intensive engineering, testing and development work for several months. We need a funding of $140,000 U.S. (before taxes) to get Cate started. This will enable us to lay the foundation in about six months. If you are looking at it from an engineering side, about 70% of the app for mobile will be developed. The more we receive initially, the farther we will get with the engineering of the final product. So if we exceed our funding goal, you are actually investing in the product.The foundation will become the spine of the platform. Based on this we will build the first versions of Cate. You will get access to the Alpha, Beta and release versions. You will get exclusive updates and perks that make you a proud part of the development of Cate. You will be among the first people who can touch and use Cate.We believe Cate will change the way how we communicate with each other. And now it’s up to you! You have the power to make this happen.River Profile on AngellistMusic for the video “Cate: We just want to talk” by Keith Kenniff.Music for the video “This is how it works” by PanosLa (Soundcloud, CC License).Disclaimer: The definition and limitation of services provided by Twitter, Facebook, Appnet and Google will be subject to their offering. Cate is not associated in any way with the aforementioned services.* Beta versions of software are buggy. They are meant for testing with users. You get the choice to install a Beta version, but it is on your own risk.** Depending on the state of existence of the company and product.If you would like to test Cate in the alpha development stage (even before beta), please write us and prove that you are a developer. Involving outsides for alpha testing makes only sense to us if you can contribute to identifying issues with an engineering perspective.Frequently Asked QuestionsIs Cate a new messaging service?It is not a new service like Whatsapp or WeChat.

<p>Over the past decade, like so many of my friends,  I tried to rely on my smart phone
and computer to organize my daily life and projects. </p>
<p>But it just didn't work.  </p>
<p>I've found that there’s something about putting a pen to paper that makes everything more tangible, which makes <i>me</i> more productive.</p>
<p>I found myself daydreaming about having a place for all my projects and my weekly and monthly schedules, all in one book.  After talking with hundreds of quilting friends across the country, I decided to dive in and make it a reality for us all.</p>

Over the past decade, like so many of my friends,  I tried to rely on my smart phone
and computer to organize my daily life and projects. 
But it just didn't work.  
I've found that there’s something about putting a pen to paper that makes everything more tangible, which makes me more productive.
I found myself daydreaming about having a place for all my projects and my weekly and monthly schedules, all in one book.  After talking with hundreds of quilting friends across the country, I decided to dive in and make it a reality for us all.



The Quilter’s Planner is the first of its kind,
designed specifically for busy, creative quilters who have many life responsibilities.

It contains everything you need to organize the work, personal and
quilting parts of your life.
This project represents a beautiful collaboration of members of our quilting community.  Over 50 quilting bloggers generously submitted their blocks for inclusion, and 10 renowned designers contributed patterns and design consultation, to make this planner a truly inspirational tool for all quilters.

CALENDAR PAGES




The weekly two-page calendar has plenty of space to  write your daily appointments.  The left hand margin has instructions for an original quilt block design developed by fantastic bloggers in our quilting community.  The bottom of the page has separate areas for writing your work, personal and quilting to do lists, and an area for notes. 


The paper is high-quality, which means highlighters will not bleed through.  At the top of each day, there is space to write your daily top three -- the most important 3 things you need to get done to have a successful day.
The monthly calendar is simple and uncluttered, allowing you the space you need to
plan your life.

The left margin has a space to set your monthly goals, to inspire and remind you about what you're working toward achieving each month.  It could be living a healthier life, it could be to finish the quilt that's sitting on your shelf.  It's up to you!  But research shows that setting realistic goals and writing them down leads to more success, so go for it!


 

PROJECTS

I designed The Quilter's Planner not only to be a place that you track your appointments and responsibilities, but also a place you can plan and organize your crafting projects.The planner contains graph paper for sketching new quilt designs, and space to doodle and practice your free motion quilting designs.

This page allows you list all your Works in Progress, so you can see all your quilting projects in one place.  You can track your progress, priorities and deadlines.

There are sections to keep notes about what materials you have, what you need, and the steps you need to take to finish. And my favorite part? You can even attach fabric swatches at the bottom and a picture or sketch of your project at the top, with included sticky dots!
PATTERNS 

There are 8 beautiful full quilt patterns, with color instructions, by amazing quilt designers, including Cheryl Brickey (Meadowmist Designs), Yvonne Fuchs (Quilting Jetgirl), Amy Garro (13 Spools), Lee Heinrich (Freshly Pieced), Mandy Leins (Mandalei Quilts), Pat Sloan (Pat Sloan), Kitty Wilkin (Night Quilter) and me.




REFERENCES

The planner also contains a reference section with important quilting measurements and construction techniques for common designs.


ARTWORK


We included 5 gorgeous pieces of artwork with elegant quilting motifs and inspirational quotes about creativity.  The artwork is designed by hand by artist Kelsey Boes from Lovely and Enough. These original pieces are perfect for hanging on your craft room walls.

Look at the big picture and know what's coming. The monthly calendars allow you to get a bird's eye view of your year and months so you can plan ahead and stay organized.

Manage your time. A daily appointment calendar allows you to easily keep track of where you need to be, and how you spend your time.

Create a keepsake of your quilting and personal life. By tracking your projects and life, you are keeping a journal, a snap-shot of your life.  You can look back in years to come and see how you've grown and all you've achieved. 

Be inspired. Inspirational quotes and beautiful artwork keep you motivated and encourage creativity.

Customize it.  This planner is designed to be tailored to your life.  Whether you're balancing work and your creative life, or setting new goals as a quilter, this planner gives you flexibility to use it in the way that serves you best.


Follow your bliss. Manage your time and set realistic goals so you can do more of what you love!


Get focused. Weekly and daily layouts, and room to prioritize your daily top three tasks that need to get done allow you to focus your attention on the most important things in your life. 


The Quilter’s Planner will be made in the USA, printed in Austin, Texas.
The up-front design costs in creating a planner are substantial, so
I’m asking for support from our awesome quilting community to help
me bring the project to life.

Please help me get the word out to quilters everywhere about this amazing new tool.  Once you log in to Indiegogo, you can quickly and easily share this campaign on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter using the share tools on the sidebars.  I will be initiating a fun reward contest to thank my supporters for sharing this project with others.

<p>When we began work on the EORA 3D scanner, our goal was to make sure it was extremely precise and easy to use. We considered every element that defined professional 3D scanners - the processors, cameras, build quality, turntable design, projected light scanners and laser based scanners. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/eoraweb2/Graphics/G2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sure, there are all kinds of 3D scanners today -- from projected light scanners that connect via a tablet that are handheld and fast, to traditional flat-bed/turntable scanners that are too often slow and stationary -- but none are accurate, unless you have $15,000 to spend. So we challenged ourselves to design and engineer a 3D scanner that not only was extremely precise and accurate but also fast, portable and affordable.</p>
<p>The solution, it turned out, was sitting in our pockets. By harnessing the power and optics of a modern smartphone, we knew we could reduce our part-count and invest instead in the one part that makes high-precision scanning possible -- a green laser.</p>

<p>The most unique feature of the EORA 3D scanner is its green laser. Most consumer 3D scanners use a red laser, but digital camera CMOS sensors (like our eyes) are twice as sensitive to the green spectrum as they are to red. (It's how we evolved to better spot predators in the brush.) This means you can scan in a variety of lighting conditions. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/eoraweb/GIFS/Dino-Scan-2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A green laser costs almost three times as much as a standard red laser. But when you have a smartphone that does all the heavy lifting, it allows us to save cost on the camera and processor and instead invest more in other areas like the laser optics and powerful algorithms for the app.</p>

<p>When you first hold the EORA 3D Scanner, you'll be pleasantly surprised. The chassis is a single piece of extruded 6061 aluminium, which is necessary to maintain the rigidity of the entire system. To be precise down to 100 microns, it critical that there are no vibrations in the system, especially when the top section that encapsulates the laser module is continually moving.</p>

<p>Our product was “designed for manufacturing” from the very beginning. This meant designing the product and it’s components taking into consideration the limitations and capabilities of actual industrial equipment and processes, which in our case is CNC machines and surface treatments for aluminium. Of the seven major prototypes that we iterated through in the last 12 months, only three were 3D Printed, the rest were machined on the very machines that will mass manufacture your EORA 3D scanners. This upcoming batch of pre-mass manufactured units help us figure out a variety of things, such as the optimal cutting speed/feed rates and the overall manufacturing workflow. </p>

<p>We can't wait for you to get your hands on what we are building!</p>
</div><p> </p></div>","Hi, we are EORA 3D (◕‿◕)Not long ago, we needed a 3D scanner that was both affordable AND highly-precise, but we were tired of waiting on others to build one, so we built one ourselves.We’ve made the world’s first high-precision 3D scanner that is entirely powered by a modern smartphone. It lets you capture everyday physical objects and surfaces and turns them into high-quality 3D models, all on your phone, making it extremely affordable. This is the 3D scanner we wanted. It’s smart, powerful and beautiful and we know you'll love it, too. A fundamentally new way to capture the world in 3D. 
 
Extraordinary results.
Models accurate to sub-100 microns.
 
Meshed ScanNormals360 Degree Point Cloud360 Degree Wireframe  As Seen In  “The EORA 3D Scanner Can Capture The Very Soul Of An Object” - John Biggs, TechCrunch“The EORA 3D Is The Missing Piece Of Your Star Trek Replicator” - John Brownlee, FastCompany“EORA 3D has approached the problem from a different angle” - Klint Finley, Wired“hardware–and software–have all come together to make the world of digital design and 3D printing much more available to all” - Bridget Butler Millsaps, 3DPrint.com“Resembles a tiny R2D2-like robot who is holding up a smartphone, attempting to reach out and 3D scan the entire galaxy in front of it” - Tyler Koslow, 3DPrintingIndustry.com“Move one step closer to a Replicator with the EORA 3D Scanner” - UncrateEORA3D won one of the Innovations Of The Year 2016 - Popular Science 
Unlike Anything Else
Meticulously designed.

When we began work on the EORA 3D scanner, our goal was to make sure it was extremely precise and easy to use. We considered every element that defined professional 3D scanners - the processors, cameras, build quality, turntable design, projected light scanners and laser based scanners. 
 

 
Sure, there are all kinds of 3D scanners today -- from projected light scanners that connect via a tablet that are handheld and fast, to traditional flat-bed/turntable scanners that are too often slow and stationary -- but none are accurate, unless you have $15,000 to spend. So we challenged ourselves to design and engineer a 3D scanner that not only was extremely precise and accurate but also fast, portable and affordable.
The solution, it turned out, was sitting in our pockets. By harnessing the power and optics of a modern smartphone, we knew we could reduce our part-count and invest instead in the one part that makes high-precision scanning possible -- a green laser.
And by tapping into the potential of a modern smartphone, the result: 
Works with iOS & Android

Compatible with both Android and iOS, the EORA 3D scanner connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0 and the EORA 3D App is FREE to download from the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.

FEATURES
 

An unprecedented sub-100 micron precision.Feature size: > 500 microns.Scans are captured in full color and rendered in-app on screen.
 
 

Scan up to a range of 1 meter (3 feet).Based on a typical smartphone camera's Field Of View this lets you capture an incredible 1 square meter (3 feet X 3 feet) in a single scan.For objects that are larger, you can take multiple scans and stitch them in-app or on compatible desktop software.A 1/4"" - 20 UNC thread is included in the bottom for easy mounting on tripods.  
Eye Safe Class 2M LaserWavelength: 520nmGlass Lens with Anti-Reflection coating

The most unique feature of the EORA 3D scanner is its green laser. Most consumer 3D scanners use a red laser, but digital camera CMOS sensors (like our eyes) are twice as sensitive to the green spectrum as they are to red. (It's how we evolved to better spot predators in the brush.) This means you can scan in a variety of lighting conditions. 

A green laser costs almost three times as much as a standard red laser. But when you have a smartphone that does all the heavy lifting, it allows us to save cost on the camera and processor and instead invest more in other areas like the laser optics and powerful algorithms for the app.


Bluetooth Turntable
360° scans

 
Unlike other 3D laser scanners, EORA doesn’t require a turntable (because the app stitches together multiple scans from various angles to create a full model). Turntables can make scanning smaller objects easier, however, so we created an optional companion wireless turntable that connects to EORA via Bluetooth.





App
Just Tap Scan


App-driven means you already know how to use the EORA 3D scanner. We designed the EORA 3D app to be simple, uncomplicated and useful. Just tap “Scan."" 
Library is where all of your 3D models live, and with Dropbox integration built-in, you can load your existing 3D models or share the ones you have scanned.


 



All New Ways To Interact With Your 3D Models

Design & Manufacturing

When you first hold the EORA 3D Scanner, you'll be pleasantly surprised. The chassis is a single piece of extruded 6061 aluminium, which is necessary to maintain the rigidity of the entire system. To be precise down to 100 microns, it critical that there are no vibrations in the system, especially when the top section that encapsulates the laser module is continually moving.

Machined & Anodised
Over 35 lathe operations to tolerances of 25µ
 
Our product was “designed for manufacturing” from the very beginning. This meant designing the product and it’s components taking into consideration the limitations and capabilities of actual industrial equipment and processes, which in our case is CNC machines and surface treatments for aluminium. Of the seven major prototypes that we iterated through in the last 12 months, only three were 3D Printed, the rest were machined on the very machines that will mass manufacture your EORA 3D scanners. This upcoming batch of pre-mass manufactured units help us figure out a variety of things, such as the optimal cutting speed/feed rates and the overall manufacturing workflow.

We’re offering 3 Kaihua Choc variants in the X-1. Resistance measurements, called force curves, are available for each switch in the charts below.
 


Choc Brown: gentle, smooth tactile switch

Choc Red: easy to press linear switch

Choc White: sharp sounding clicky switch with amazing tactility


If those terms don’t make sense, here’s a quick rundown on each Choc switch type:
 


Brown / tactile switches have a tangible “bump” when pressed, but no click. They’re a familiar option for typists and gamers, as most keyboards are tactile.

Red / linear switches don’t have a tactile bump or a click. That can be advantageous if you prefer uninhibited keypresses.

White / clicky switches make sharp clicking noises. They also have a sharp tactile bump. Check with your coworkers, or family, before introducing a clicky keyboard. They’re gloriously loud!

Important Backer Information:
X-1 Carrying Case
All switch options have the same price. You will be able to select your switch type when the campaign ends. A reward voucher code will be sent to your email after its close. Once it arrives, you will need to configure your X-1 on kono.store — our partner storefront.

<h3>Upgrade Your Sack</h3> <p>We started <a href=""http://www.mochibrand.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mochibrand</a> to revolutionize the drawstring backpack. Two years ago, we made a small history for a humble drawstring backpack with big innovations with the help of crowdfunding.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>No more digging fingers to open a closed bag</li>
<li>No more finagling with uneven cords</li>
</ul>
<p>Truly disruptive by design, we believe Mochibags are the best drawstring backpacks that solved the issue of uneven cords and hard to open bags. Now, we are back, to make another small history with our latest work, The All New EXPEDITION EDITION Mochibag.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to be invited here to showcase our campaign, <b>to be delivered in December 2015</b>, through Indiegogo's latest, InDemand opportunity.</p>

It also provides much needed protection from the top against the elements while keeping the shape of the bag in balance. The compression lid is integrated with the new Center O-Ring, and stays perfectly centered and close to the main panel at all times, even during opening and closing. The Center O-Ring is located at the strongest load bearing point, creating an approximate center of mass when backpack is loaded and compressed.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>The compression lid is made with 100% circular knit nylon fabric with treated backing, and layered with Cordura panel on the other side. This anti-static fabric material will resist stains, mold, mildew, dust, lint, and dirt, an will not fray. It's semi-rigid, which adds structure and texture element to the bag, and is hook compatible. Yes, velcro patches.</p>

<h3>Inspiration and Design</h3>
<p>For the newly designed EXPEDITION EDITION, we wanted a purpose built, good looking compression lid, that would work seamlessly with the rest of the bag. We drew our design inspiration from a utilitarian Jeep and its Bimini top for the effortless good looks that come from pure function. The EXPEDITION EDITION with the compression lid works and looks amazing.</p>

</div></div>","Upgrade Your Sack We started Mochibrand to revolutionize the drawstring backpack. Two years ago, we made a small history for a humble drawstring backpack with big innovations with the help of crowdfunding.


No more digging fingers to open a closed bag
No more finagling with uneven cords

Truly disruptive by design, we believe Mochibags are the best drawstring backpacks that solved the issue of uneven cords and hard to open bags. Now, we are back, to make another small history with our latest work, The All New EXPEDITION EDITION Mochibag.
We are thrilled to be invited here to showcase our campaign, to be delivered in December 2015, through Indiegogo's latest, InDemand opportunity.


   The All New Expedition Edition We spent the past 2 years building our team, perfecting our design and craft, incorporating feedback from our thousands of supporters and customers. Every change, big and small, had to be done with a useful purpose in mind while staying true to form and to its core benefits – lightweight, collapsible, drawstring backpack.


15 oz. (425 g) with the Compression Lid
6 x 5 x 3 in. (15.2 x 12.7 x 7.6cm) with the Compression Lid
This will forever change the way you think about drawstring backpacks.
Innovation  We created a three point compression lid for keeping things tight when needed. It also provides much needed protection from the top against the elements while keeping the shape of the bag in balance. The compression lid is integrated with the new Center O-Ring, and stays perfectly centered and close to the main panel at all times, even during opening and closing. The Center O-Ring is located at the strongest load bearing point, creating an approximate center of mass when backpack is loaded and compressed.



The compression lid is made with 100% circular knit nylon fabric with treated backing, and layered with Cordura panel on the other side. This anti-static fabric material will resist stains, mold, mildew, dust, lint, and dirt, an will not fray. It's semi-rigid, which adds structure and texture element to the bag, and is hook compatible. Yes, velcro patches.

<p><b>My goal
is to raise £500 for PTSE. If the campaign equals or exceeds this amount, I
will cut my hair and donate it to the Little Princess Trust.</b></p><h3><b>The highest contributor has
the chance to shave my head clean!</b></h3>
<p>All over
the world, there are several million children suffering with long-term hair
loss, and several million more are being exploited in criminal commercial
activities. <b>You may even know a victim; they may be a family member, a friend,
a child in your neighborhood or town, or a co-worker's child. Unfortunately
these two causes of suffering exist everywhere, but the good news is: We can
help!</b></p>
<p>The Little Princess is an established trust that has been going on for 8 years. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">On the
other hand, PTSE is a baby in this field, having started only last year, but
making efforts to become trusted and efficient. My hope is not only that this </span>campaign<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> will bring a much needed financial boost to PTSE, but also offer
exposure to what they do, that in 8 years time they may also be well established.</span></p><p>There are two things I believe set PTSE apart from other human-trafficking organisations, and this is why I have committed to back their cause: Firstly they understand that the life-changing solution for the victim, the trafficker, and the consumer is the Gospel! Secondly, they realise that there is a need to decrease demand if we are to make a lasting impact, and one of the ways that demand can be diminished is by addressing the issue of addiction to pornography, brothels, prostitution, and other forms of immoral sexual activities: this is an issue that is rarely - if ever - addressed in our culture.</p>
<p>Last but
not least, thank you for taking the time to read about this campaign! Your

you can’t, then let me challenge you to make some noise for this campaign!

<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><br/>Palmetti developed from a crazy material research and design project into a positive social initiative.</em></strong></p>
<p><br/> My Palmetti adventure began with the discovery of a new material. To cut a long story short, when the brittle shed bark of the Areca Palm is soaked in a natural oil solution, the result is soft, flexible, and surprisingly leather-like material, hence the name. We did more tests to stabilize the material, ordered more boxes of bark from south India (they were probably wondering: what is this guy doing with this useless bark?!), created samples and designed products with them including bags, covers and sandals. The story doesn’t end…with the end products.<br/><br/></p>
<h2>Environmentally responsible</h2>
<p>The material is an abundant natural wonder and we were curious to see if plant waste like this could be upgraded on a large scale. So I booked a ticket to tropical south India (where the tree is native) to find out more.<br/><br/><img alt=""Areca palm tree"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/954810_574019965983388_1624053048_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Areca palm tree""/><br/><br/>Here, we found plentiful amounts of beautiful bark that is normally left to decay, burned for firewood or sometimes used to make disposable plates. Meanwhile, seeing the cheap plastic flip-flops everywhere in India, we wondered if our sandals could provide a biodegradable alternative? To make a bigger impact, we realized that the biodegradable nature of our sandals potentially made them a serious replacement also for the disposable plastic white hotel sandals. (Did you know that every year, 50 million are produced, worn once and then discarded in hotels all around the world?) </p>
<p>We proposed Palmettis to hotels, resorts, cruise ships and took samples to fairs, exhibitions and conferences: the response has been overwhelmingly positive so far! So with our own money, we decided to set up a production unit in South India – close to the material source – in collaboration with the craftspeople to produce the Palmleather and Palmetti sandals.<br/><br/></p>
<h2>Socially Responsible</h2>
<p>We began totally from scratch and set up the production unit right from the start in a socially responsible way. <strong>We believe in a production culture free of sweatshops, greed and inhumane working conditions. </strong>Together with the craftspeople and our local Indian partners we set up a small producer-owned production unit in Gadag, Karnataka in South West India.<br/><br/><img alt=""Material sorting in our production unit"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/935729_573168272735224_1062683263_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Material sorting in our production unit""/></p>
<p>                              <em>Sadsukhibai carefully selecting the best leaves for Palmetti</em></p>
<p>This is not a standard outsourcing factory operation in India. Making the cheapest product possible at the expense of the environment and people is simply not an option. With our unit, we provide training and employment for 30 local craftspeople, mostly women, who receive fair pay and work in comfortable conditions. It is set up in a socially cohesive way and together the craftspeople collaborate into making this product a success: eventually they will become owners of the unit. Empowerment means the people receive training to become not just craft persons but also self-reliant small-scale entrepreneurs in their local communities. We are convinced that this is the right way to do business and with your help, we can keep growing in this direction.<br/><br/></p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<h2><img alt=""Palmleather textures"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/968797_574504625934922_559539529_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-size: 10px;"" title=""Palmleather textures""/></h2>
<p>We refined the design together with the craftspeople who possess incredible craft and material knowhow. Our sandals are composed of layers of Palmleather stitched together to maximize strength and flexibility. The strap in our classic model is connected with textiles made next door which makes it fold flat for easy packaging.  Our more recent thong sandal has straps made from 100% organic cotton and allows the customer to choose from six different colour options. For customization, a pattern or image – for example a resort logo – can be simply burned onto the sandal. By infusing craft with design, we want to help keep the tradition of the handmade and craftsmanship alive while making a product with design AND craft value.<br/><br/></p>
<h2>Why do we want to grow?</h2>
<p>We are absolutely thrilled that people all around the world are so enthusiastic about the Palmettis and want to buy them. To be able to meet these orders, we need to produce more and this means expanding our operation. We want to do this without cramming more people into the unit, increasing work hours or reducing pay. <br/><br/> Our plan is to build a second unit modeled on our current set up, and to make this happen, we’d like to ask for your help. To build a genuinely social project, we want to invite genuine social funders to participate and that’s why we chose to go with crowdfunding. If we can raise enough funds to start our new unit, we can make many more feet happy with our product while ensuring that the livelihoods of our crafts people - who are crucial to the success of the brand - are sustained.<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/600996_574445139274204_734898693_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>

For me, Palmetti is not only about solving problems: it is equally about visualizing where you want to go, and what kind of world you want to live in. I believe we need thoughtfully designed products, not imitations of bad ones. Why not take an activist approach and fast forward the positive change? Only this way, can we begin to change our vision on the future. Thanks for your time!</p>

<p> </p></div>","GOOD TO KNOW: You may choose between ordering a pair of Palmetti Classic or Palmetti Thong Sandal. After receiving your order we will contact you to get all the details including straps colour and size. More information below under: Incentives.

Namaste! I’m Tjeerd Veenhoven. I run a product design studio in the Netherlands. Through my project Palmetti I became an (accidental) social entrepreneur in India.
Palmetti is a biodegradable sandal made with love in India from natural Palmleather. Through our project we're turning waste into value; providing a sustainable replacement for the wasteful plastic hotel or beach slipper; and helping empower craftspeople to become self-reliant entrepreneurs.With our campaign, we’re asking for your contribution to build a second artisanal production unit in India, maintaining the same firm commitment to the environment and the community with which we started working in that country. We believe a system free of sweatshops and greed is the right way to do business but we need your help to make this happen. In return for your collaboration you’ll be the first to receive a pair of Palmettis, a tablet sleeve or a personalized Palmleather bag made especially for this campaign. Thanks for helping the humble sandal make a difference!
       
 
Palmetti developed from a crazy material research and design project into a positive social initiative.
 My Palmetti adventure began with the discovery of a new material. To cut a long story short, when the brittle shed bark of the Areca Palm is soaked in a natural oil solution, the result is soft, flexible, and surprisingly leather-like material, hence the name. We did more tests to stabilize the material, ordered more boxes of bark from south India (they were probably wondering: what is this guy doing with this useless bark?!), created samples and designed products with them including bags, covers and sandals. The story doesn’t end…with the end products.
Environmentally responsible
The material is an abundant natural wonder and we were curious to see if plant waste like this could be upgraded on a large scale. So I booked a ticket to tropical south India (where the tree is native) to find out more.Here, we found plentiful amounts of beautiful bark that is normally left to decay, burned for firewood or sometimes used to make disposable plates. Meanwhile, seeing the cheap plastic flip-flops everywhere in India, we wondered if our sandals could provide a biodegradable alternative? To make a bigger impact, we realized that the biodegradable nature of our sandals potentially made them a serious replacement also for the disposable plastic white hotel sandals. (Did you know that every year, 50 million are produced, worn once and then discarded in hotels all around the world?) 
We proposed Palmettis to hotels, resorts, cruise ships and took samples to fairs, exhibitions and conferences: the response has been overwhelmingly positive so far! So with our own money, we decided to set up a production unit in South India – close to the material source – in collaboration with the craftspeople to produce the Palmleather and Palmetti sandals.
Socially Responsible
We began totally from scratch and set up the production unit right from the start in a socially responsible way. We believe in a production culture free of sweatshops, greed and inhumane working conditions. Together with the craftspeople and our local Indian partners we set up a small producer-owned production unit in Gadag, Karnataka in South West India.
                              Sadsukhibai carefully selecting the best leaves for Palmetti
This is not a standard outsourcing factory operation in India. Making the cheapest product possible at the expense of the environment and people is simply not an option. With our unit, we provide training and employment for 30 local craftspeople, mostly women, who receive fair pay and work in comfortable conditions. It is set up in a socially cohesive way and together the craftspeople collaborate into making this product a success: eventually they will become owners of the unit. Empowerment means the people receive training to become not just craft persons but also self-reliant small-scale entrepreneurs in their local communities. We are convinced that this is the right way to do business and with your help, we can keep growing in this direction.
Design

We refined the design together with the craftspeople who possess incredible craft and material knowhow. Our sandals are composed of layers of Palmleather stitched together to maximize strength and flexibility. The strap in our classic model is connected with textiles made next door which makes it fold flat for easy packaging.  Our more recent thong sandal has straps made from 100% organic cotton and allows the customer to choose from six different colour options. For customization, a pattern or image – for example a resort logo – can be simply burned onto the sandal. By infusing craft with design, we want to help keep the tradition of the handmade and craftsmanship alive while making a product with design AND craft value.
Why do we want to grow?
We are absolutely thrilled that people all around the world are so enthusiastic about the Palmettis and want to buy them. To be able to meet these orders, we need to produce more and this means expanding our operation. We want to do this without cramming more people into the unit, increasing work hours or reducing pay.  Our plan is to build a second unit modeled on our current set up, and to make this happen, we’d like to ask for your help. To build a genuinely social project, we want to invite genuine social funders to participate and that’s why we chose to go with crowdfunding. If we can raise enough funds to start our new unit, we can make many more feet happy with our product while ensuring that the livelihoods of our crafts people - who are crucial to the success of the brand - are sustained.
Incentives
Through our pledge system (perks) you can contribute to the construction of and equipment of our new production unit.

Every contributor will have his or her name written on the wall of the new unit as a constant reminder of our wonderful supporters. In addition they will receive a beautiful picture postcard, with love from India, sent from our production unit. 
Browse through our perks and be the first to get a pair of Palmettis, our new Palmleather tablet sleeve or a personalized Palmleather bag created especially for this campaign. Our Palmetti Classic sandals come in three sizes: small (fits up to 37 euro size), medium (fits up to 41 euro size) or large (fits up to 45 euro size). Palmetti thong sandals are available in most common sizes and come with custom-made straps. We have six colours of organic cotton available so that you can select up to three different ones for your product. The choice is completely yours. Personalize your very own thong sandal!
In each of the packs offered as perks you may choose for Palmetti Classic or Palmetti Thong Sandal


 
 
The bigger picture
Palmetti is part of a bigger story in thinking about the replacement of leather and plastic, both known for their high environmental impact, while stimulating the change for ethical working conditions. For me, Palmetti is not only about solving problems: it is equally about visualizing where you want to go, and what kind of world you want to live in. I believe we need thoughtfully designed products, not imitations of bad ones. Why not take an activist approach and fast forward the positive change? Only this way, can we begin to change our vision on the future. Thanks for your time!

<p>Airtame is a small wireless HDMI device that plugs into the HDMI port of any screen or projector. Unlike other wireless HDMI devices, nothing is plugged into your computer or smartphone. Simply download our app and stream your content to the screen from any major computer platform, tablet, or smartphone. When no one is streaming to the TV, you can set the default display to show a website or dashboard for something functional, like sales numbers, or just to show something pretty, like your company logo.

PBT keycaps are often considered the top choice for keycap materials, even over ABS keycaps, as PBT is much more durable, oil-resistant (won’t get shiny over time like ABS), and stays true to color longer. Our keycaps are also abrasion-resistant, waterproof, and dust resistant to keep your keyboard lasting longer - even for the daily on-the-go lifestyle. The keycap form was developed for a more ergonomic and comfortable typing experience, with a smooth curvature that perfectly fits the shape of each finger. Several choices of designs and colors are available, each custom designed by our team to meet everyone’s style.

Throughout our project development, we have constantly been in touch with mechanical keyboard communities and enthusiasts worldwide in an effort to design the best keyboard possible. We are now proud to present the culmination of over a year’s worth of our team’s R&D work. With 68-keys, the GK68XS is the perfect combination of compact design and quality construction with fully customizable functions. With dual connectivity modes (wireless or wired) and both Windows and Mac layouts, the GK68XS is the ultimate match for any device setup. It easily pairs with up to three devices at once to maximize productivity and ease of use. With its compact form and durable aluminum casing, the GK68XS is ready for any setting!   The cult behind mechanical keyboards is deep - and for good reason too. Mechanical switches deliver an unmistakable satisfaction that traditional membrane keyboards can never provideEach key stroke provides a sure tactile sensation and click, with much further key travel and quicker response than traditional membrane keyboards. This ensures that each word you type is accurate, without ever having to worry about having put down the wrong letter. Additionally, the ergonomics of mechanical keyboards and their switches provide much more comfort that is safer on the wrists and fingers. Your work and gaming experience will absolutely change with a mechanical keyboard. You may even find yourself enjoying long typing sessions on your next assignment! Once you try a quality mechanical keyboard, you can never go back!   Advanced Space Bar ModuleThe GK68 Space Key Module will provide you with endless customization. Whether it's a single key or a split spacebar style to best fit your typing preference and feel, the GK68XS is here to take your gaming and daily work to the next level.  Fully Programmable LayoutYou can reprogram any key on the GK68XS to make custom macros and add layers for extra function. To further personalize your typing experience, the advanced three-switch space bar can be converted into one space bar + FN2 and FN3 keys, to expand up to three FN function keys. Your macros and layout mapping will forever revolutionize how you interact with your program softwares and games. Customized three space key and FN to achieve the best typing experience.  
Wireless mode only available on GK68XS models.
  Wired or Wireless - The choice is yours!Designed for versatility, the GK68XS is available in two models: the GK68X and the GK68XS. The GK68XS can connect via Bluetooth for wireless connectivity or with the included Type-C USB cable. With Bluetooth 5.1, it easily connects seamlessly with your phone, laptop, or tablet. Connect wirelessly with up to three devices at once, and easily switch between devices for efficient multitasking and speedy performance. And with just a simple switch on the slide toggle, you can quickly switch between operating system layouts on the GK68XS. The GK68 is a wired keyboard for a more traditional setup, and features every aspect of the GK68XS, minus the wireless connectivity. The GK68 is a perfect match for those who do not require a wireless setup. The GK68XS - it's not just a keyboard, it's the paramount productivity tool for your daily work!    With hot-swappable Gateron or Cherry MX switches, make every press feel exactly the way you want it!The GK68XS is now hot-swappable! A rare feature among mechanical keyboards, this means you can easily change out your mechanical switches for a different type, without any soldering or effort. Want a different typing feel or sound? Simply change out the switches, and you can have a completely different tactile experience! This also extends the lifespan of the keyboard as you can easily switch out the components without throwing out the entire keyboard.  To appease every customer, we have provided two of the most popular and renowned brands for mechanical keyboards - Cherry MX and Gateron! Each is popular for the unique feel and long-lasting lifespan of the switches. You can rest assured that your GK68XS is manufactured with the best and most reliable mechanical switches out there!   
Bluetooth version required to use with smartphones.
  Mac, Windows, or Android - We got it all covered!  The GK68XS is fully compatible with every operating system (OS) from Mac/iOS to Android and Windows, and you can easily switch between the different OS with just the flip of a switch. The GK68XS is one of the few mechanical keyboards featuring the Mac layout media keys for the comprehensive integration of the UI. It allows you to use all of the same media keys as a conventional macOS keyboard, but with the unparalleled typing satisfaction of mechanical switches. Every GK68XS keyboard comes with 3 specific keycaps for Mac and Windows, respectively. Compatible with every version of each operating system.  
You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. 
  Durable Construction, Lightweight Portability  The GK68XS was designed to be a mobile and compact device for any setting. The lightweight body is constructed from precision CNC aluminum or ABS plastic to maximize durability and tactile satisfaction. Both materials build to provide a stable and firm foundation, no matter how hard you type. The ABS plastic provides a slightly lighter and more portable experience with the benefit of a more affordable price point. The full aluminum option is a more premium feature that is hard sought after by mechanical keyboard communities. Championed over plastic frames, mechanical keyboard enthusiasts have always loved the aluminum body for its durability, as well as the distinct tactile feel and sound that no plastic body can reproduce. The frames were designed with a low profile for a streamlined look that complements any setup, and easy on the wrist even without any wrist pads. The small footprint makes it easy to carry around with you everywhere, and unlike many foldable Bluetooth keyboards, the GK68XS offers the best of portability without compromising the premium typing experience of a mechanical keyboard. Plus, with a fully customizable keycap setup, you can easily change out the keys to fit your aesthetics and typing feel.  The GK68XS features RGB lighting with 16.8 million LED colors, rhythm, and sound lighting combinations, with additional key-programming and macro-creation for three definable layers. With 16.8 million colors in RGB lights, you can download additional lighting effects to the library and easily use them through the lighting effects driver. Simply connect the keyboard using the USB cable to access effects and software updates. Our database is constantly updating with different lighting effects. Enjoy a more immersive and colorful typing and gaming experience.  
ABS version is also available for the GK68X
 We chose to go with a top-grade PBT thermal sublimation keycaps. PBT keycaps are often considered the top choice for keycap materials, even over ABS keycaps, as PBT is much more durable, oil-resistant (won’t get shiny over time like ABS), and stays true to color longer. Our keycaps are also abrasion-resistant, waterproof, and dust resistant to keep your keyboard lasting longer - even for the daily on-the-go lifestyle. The keycap form was developed for a more ergonomic and comfortable typing experience, with a smooth curvature that perfectly fits the shape of each finger. Several choices of designs and colors are available, each custom designed by our team to meet everyone’s style. Additionally, the spacebar can be customized using the included key options, whether it be one long single bar, or a three-way split space bar to increase speed, ease of pressing, and feel. To maximize the full functionality of the GK68XS’s features, we have integrated a 32-bit M3 MCU chipset with onboard 8M Flash Memory, and 3 channel 256 professional-level RGB color management chip. Your keyboard programming and macro customizations will be seamless, and you can be sure of smooth user experience.  Each keyboard comes with your choice of mechanical switches, so you can get just the feel you like—whether you prefer something heavy and tactile, or lightweight and linear. We offer two major and most popular brands in mechanical switches - Cherry and Gateron. Plus, the GK68XS is hot-swappable, meaning you can simply switch out the mechanical switches without any soldering! Already have a favorite Cherry MX mechanical switch? We have you covered. The GK68XS is available with classic Cherry MX Blue, Brown, Red, or Black switches.
The MX Blue switch provides the most tactile sensation and sound, with the distinct “click” noise characteristic of mechanical keyboards.
The MX Brown switch offers a similar tactile sensation as the Blue, but is a little bit quieter for office use.
The MX Red switch is linear in feel, and do not have a tactile bump like the Blue or Brown switches. This means you can feel the switch go all the way down and up, in a very smooth fashion. The Red switch is also much quieter than the Blue or Brown switches, which makes it ideal for work settings.
The MX Black switch is a linear switch, similar to the MX Red switch, but with a heavier operating force. The Black switch is perfect for those wanting a quiet typing session, but with a heavier feel than the traditional MX red switch. 
 
PHOTOS AND INFO OF THE SWITCH (C) 2020 CHERRY GMBHGateron switches are popular around the world for their durability and distinct tactile and sonic characteristics. We offer the Gateron Optical switches, which have a much smoother press than traditional Gateron switches, and have a longer lifespan of 100 million keystrokes. 
 The Gateron Blue switch gives a tactile sensation and sound, with a noticeable bump with each press to ensure every keystroke is on point. 
The Gateron Red switch is a linear switch that presses smoothly down without any bump or click in between presses. This also means a much quieter typing sound that is perfect for the office workspace. 
The Gateron Brown switch is a tactile switch like the Gateron Blue switch, but with a much quieter sound for sound-sensitive environments. Many see the Brown switch as an in-between of the Blue and Red switches. 
The Gateron Black switch is a linear switch like that of the Gateron Red switch, but has a heavier feel. This means you will feel a little more resistance as you press down than the Gateron Red switch, and is a perfect match for heavy typers who want confidence with every stroke.

</div><div><br/></div><h3>Introducing the MAVBoard!</h3><p>The MAVBoard is a way to share a single MAVLink telemetry connection (the telemetry port on a 3D Robotics APM 2.X, for example) among multiple devices, such as OSDs, telemetry radios, telemetry converters or other add-on boards. Until now, the solution has been to create <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">custom soldered cable harnesses which are difficult to make and not as flexible, since only one device can be connected to the ""Tx"" pin of the MAVLink connection.</span></p><p><br/></p><p>The MAVBoard makes connecting several MAVLink devices a breeze. It is very easy to choose which device can access the ""Tx"" pin of the MAVLink connection by a simple jumper. Now your OSD, two-way telemetry radio AND FrSky telemetry can all run at the same time without the wiring being a nightmare!</p><p><br/></p><p>The Pro model also includes on onboard Arduino compatible ATMega328P chip which is also connected to the MAVLink hub that performs protocol translation on the MAVLink stream and output the translated signal to a dedicated set of pins. There is existing code (based on JDrone's <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/arducodes/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FjD_IOBoard%2FjD_IOBoard_FrSkyMAVLink%253Fstate%253Dclosed"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jD_IOBoard_FrSkyMAVLink</a> code) today that can translate MAVLink into the FrSky hub protocol so you can the FrSky FLD-02 and see useful telemetry values right on your RC transmitter!</p><p><br/></p><p>If FrSky had their way, we would all end up with a second altimeter, GPS, voltage monitor, etc on our UAVs with one of their ""hubs"" connected to the FrSky Rx telemetry port. Most flight controllers, and especially MAVLink based autopilots, already have all these sensors! The MAVBoard's goal is to utilize all those existing sensors in our autopilots and provide a telemetry stream to our RC transmitters.</p><p><br/></p><p>Work is also in progress to support the new SmartPort protocol uses by the FrSky Taranis radio. OpenLRSng support is also possible with some basic hardware mods to your OpenLRSng Tx module. This will allow telemetry data to show up directly on the Taranis LCD screen without having to attach an external LCD.</p><p><br/></p><p>This is an Open Source Hardware project!

No matter what you are hoping to accomplish in your life, from getting your business off the ground, to running your first marathon, to paying off your debt – you’ll have a great deal more success if you take the time to write it down; create a daily plan &amp; do the work.

The drawings were submitted to GreenSpot this Fall and the project has been quoted at $5000* with a comment describing that the bill often comes in less. One of the “perks” for this project is especially exciting, four 
contributions of $1000 or more will receive furniture built from material
 actually recycled from the building site! This custom piece will be 
built by the architect and defines the term “Environmental Design.”*note: If the project exceeds its initial funding requirement of $5000 by $1000, we will also strive for The Living Building Challenge! Exceed by $2000 and we will develop a complete project graphics kit describing all the innovative features of the project!   The Impact     There are three major components driving the green building industry; unprecedented Washington initiatives, increased residential demand and dramatic improvements in sustainable materials. In the last decade, students across the nation have been advocating for LEED rated buildings on their campuses as well as heightened recycling and sustainability outreach programs. Nations such as Taiwan have been environmentally pressured to rethink their life support systems and have created museums and cultural centers entirely out of plastic bottles! We have an opportunity in the U.S. to continue to lead and explore the possibilities and advantages of green-building, it is up to us to move forward in a culturally responsible and creatively independent way. Other Ways You Can Help     If you cannot contribute today, I encourage you to explore the world of environmental design, sustainable construction and green-building!  Also, feel free to use the IndieGoGo tools to share with family and friends across the world!Thank You,Rob Hollisp.s. Drawings of the barn to be built are in the ""Gallery"" section (the tab is at the top of the page). The ""Gallery"" also includes two video links, one explains Energy Star certifications while the other explains LEED certifications.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>CampuZoic is the only mobile app company geared at revolutionizing the college experience. It digitally transforms the urban landscape of colleges, via smart phone technology. We have already built a working prototype for Cal Poly Pomona which has been a huge success and we would like to bring it to at least 100 more college campuses over the next year. This is directly where your backing will come into play. Your backing will be used toward expanding our database of college information, marketing at each college we support, and any further development that is required to fix bugs and improve the app.</p>
<h2><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></h2>
<p>The name CampuZoic is a word mash of “campus” and the suffix “zoic,” referring to life or existence, so quite literally, CampuZoic means “Campus Life.” CampuZoic’s founding partners, Shawn Irvin and Adeline Ramirez have been working together in Southern California on mobile applications for iPhone and Android platforms since early 2009. Shawn Irvin is a recent Computer Information Systems graduate of Cal Poly Pomona while Adeline Ramirez is an entrepreneur with 2 degrees in philosophy and political science. During their partnership, Shawn thought it would be helpful to create an app for his college. This is where the desire began to bring this sort of mobile technology to college campuses across the nation.</p>
<h2>WHERE WE’RE AT</h2>
<p>We currently have a working prototype of CampuZoic for the campus of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona with an average user base of 2,000 users. Features include: News, Directory, Maps, Food, Web Links, and Cleeks (Clubs &amp; Greeks).</p>

</div></div>","9 LIVES FOR YOUR WRIST.
What if the millions of keystrokes, mouse-clicks, and gestures could be easier and more natural? Multiplied over the course of a career, the negative impact of repetitive motion and strain would be reduced, adding ""9 lives"" to your wrist!

MAGNETIC LEVITATION.
Wristocat uses magnetic levitation to neutralize repetitive strain and minimize resistance, all while boosting your performance. 
With your hand floating on a friction-free magnetic field, every click, keystroke, and gesture is fully supported and virtually effortless. 
Whether you click a mouse, tap a keyboard, gesture on a touchpad, or spend time gaming, Wristocat is your “Hands Best Friend.” 


THE PURR-FECT LANDING.
Wristocat's interchangeable supports ensure the perfect landing.  Fine tune your Wristocat's personality with color and support add-ons for style, therapy, variety, and performance.
And since every wristocat add on is designed to attach magnetically, interchange is a literal ""snap.""  Simply lift off, replace, and keep going. 

INTERCHANGEABLE SUPPORTS.

The standard Wristocat support is designed to cradle the palm, keep your wrists aligned, and relieve pressure from the carpal tunnel area. It is constructed out of super-soft ""memory foam"" so your hand will PURRRRR!

The ""Thermal Disc"" adds therapeutic warmth and cooling. Inside the disc is a thermal layer with a special shape to maximize comfort and minimize pressure. The disc is constructed out of soft, food grade silicone to make it safe, comfortable, and easy to clean.

The Ultra Low Disc, also constructed from food grade silicon, is a favorite for those who appreciate minimalistic design and crave a lower profile. Prowling just millimeters above the surface, you may forget that it's even there!

<p>Currently, when new bloggers and webmasters aren’t getting enough visitors to their sites, they turn to SEO (Search Engine Optimization) to generate traffic through Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Soon, instead of focusing on their core passions, many find themselves consumed by SEO, adding keywords, submitting to search engines, posting on other blogs, and they may even consider hiring SEO experts to get noticed in the big three search engines.  Within a few months, most bloggers and startups abandon their online efforts and nobody ever knows what unique products, services, or insights they had to offer.</p>
<p>Thumbar will empower creative and entrepreneurial people on the Internet with the exposure their efforts deserve, by providing an alternative to conquering search engines with SEO. Bloggers and entrepreneurs will be free to focus 100% of their time and energy on their passions, rather than on promoting them, while enabling their content to directly attract visitors through social feedback.</p>
<h3><font color=""#2266ee"">Thumbar Attracts Free Traffic Socially<br/></font></h3>
<p>A Thumbar is a rating plugin that collects and summarizes visitor feedback and then enhances exposure for a blog or website by establishing a mirrored copy of itself at Thumbar.com, a socially networked gateway. There, the better its ratings, the higher its chance of getting noticed and attracting visitors.<br/></p>

<h3><font color=""#2266ee"">How it Works<br/></font></h3>
<p>When the first vote is cast at a website, a message containing a copy of the plugin, a snippet of content, and a link back to the site, is instantly popped into Thumbar.com, where the copy is then kept in sync with the plugin at the source site. At Thumbar.com, people can search, sort, and follow messages and their creators, and click on them to get redirected to the websites where the content originates, making Thumbar.com a gateway for helping websites get discovered and trending.<br/><br/></p>

<p>If you are managing a business marketing department, or running a business, the pressure is on—you are either shrinking or growing. We’ve designed a tool that helps you increase sales by multiplying your marketing resources 10 to 1. MyBrand combines big-agency talent with Digital Asset Management (DAM), and Brand Asset Management (BAM) so anyone can instantly create branded marketing collateral for print or web publishing. <br/></p>
<br/>We assess your brand and develop a strategy that works for you. You get custom branded formats for a fraction of what it would cost to hire a high-caliber marketing or branding agency. And there’s no learning curve. MyBrand is an easy-to-use, cloud-based platform so there’s no need to learn expensive design programs or coding. <br/><ul>

We are excited to offer you MyBrand, so you can benefit from the strategic thinking, technology, and consistent messaging enjoyed by top brands. If you help us to complete our software development, we are offering several Perks based on your level of support, including the full MyBrand service at a one-time only reduced rate. <br/><br/>The development timeline is 12 weeks after launch.

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Solideer.Org: An Online Community that Connects Volunteers with Solidarity Work around the World</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine a world where at the push of a button, millions of
everyday individuals could create or search for customizable solidarity
projects (from a onetime act of kindness to a larger scale project over the
span of weeks or months). This will be possible through the Solideer App!
Solideer will take money, religion and political agendas out of the equation,
and make it possible for just about anyone to do good in this world by using
social technology to connect, organize and carry out Solideer projects.</p>
<p>Whether it's traveling half way across the world to deliver clothing collected from their community to an orphanage in China, or helping repair a veteran's home in their own home town on the weekends; Solideer will empower individuals to take action and change the world, one small act at a time. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Solideer wants to build a global community of active individuals who can put their time, resources and skills to work for a cause they deem worthy, and who wish to do so on their own time and under their directive, while still being able to work under the safety and cohesion of a larger group.</span></p>
<p>Solideer will target individuals ages 22-44 who are interested in solution oriented news, by partnering with ad services to introduce unique algorithms that will help these individuals find specific projects that provide a direct solution for the problem or tragedy the article covers. </p>
<p> Some of the features of the Solideer app include:</p>
<p>*Comprehensive communication platform with a user friendly interface that allows peer to peer communications, group messaging, group chat, etc., enabling the creation and execution of projects; which will cover an ever increasing spectrum as more users join the online community.</p>
<p>*Team building and networking features to enable peer to peer engagement and the systematic planning of specific solidarity missions, similar to LinkedIn, as well as the former Yelp achievement medals feature, which will unlock as the user successfully carries out projects or engages in existing projects. </p>
<p>*Streamlined fundraising features to enable individuals and organizations to quickly raise funds to fulfill immediate needs  for Micro-Solidarity activities such as the purchase of needed aid, transportation of the aid to the place in need, travel expenses for volunteers, etc. Transparency and leanness will be a strong aspect of how fundraising is done, with customization features that make it possible for donors to assign funds to very specific uses within each campaign.</p>
<p>*Extensive user profile creation for individuals, ""expeditions"", grassroots groups and formal non-profits. Functions similar to those used by dating sites like Tinder and Match.com will help individuals connect within the community around specific missions and projects, collaborate and team up. A feature similar to LinkedIn will also enable users to connect with real-world users, build their reputation around solidarity work and interact.</p>
<p>*Customizable platforms for large organizations that would like to engage large groups of volunteers and rally them around specific causes.</p>
<p>Solideer will become the largest online community of solidarity oriented individuals looking to start or collaborate on Solidarity projects and connect with other like-minded individuals. </p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>Traditional public charities can often be cumbersome, inefficient and reactive by nature. A human crisis erupts somewhere in the world; they pass the hat for donations.

</div></div>","Solideer.Org: An Online Community that Connects Volunteers with Solidarity Work around the World


Imagine a world where at the push of a button, millions of
everyday individuals could create or search for customizable solidarity
projects (from a onetime act of kindness to a larger scale project over the
span of weeks or months). This will be possible through the Solideer App!
Solideer will take money, religion and political agendas out of the equation,
and make it possible for just about anyone to do good in this world by using
social technology to connect, organize and carry out Solideer projects.
Whether it's traveling half way across the world to deliver clothing collected from their community to an orphanage in China, or helping repair a veteran's home in their own home town on the weekends; Solideer will empower individuals to take action and change the world, one small act at a time. 
Solideer wants to build a global community of active individuals who can put their time, resources and skills to work for a cause they deem worthy, and who wish to do so on their own time and under their directive, while still being able to work under the safety and cohesion of a larger group.
Solideer will target individuals ages 22-44 who are interested in solution oriented news, by partnering with ad services to introduce unique algorithms that will help these individuals find specific projects that provide a direct solution for the problem or tragedy the article covers. 
 Some of the features of the Solideer app include:
*Comprehensive communication platform with a user friendly interface that allows peer to peer communications, group messaging, group chat, etc., enabling the creation and execution of projects; which will cover an ever increasing spectrum as more users join the online community.
*Team building and networking features to enable peer to peer engagement and the systematic planning of specific solidarity missions, similar to LinkedIn, as well as the former Yelp achievement medals feature, which will unlock as the user successfully carries out projects or engages in existing projects. 
*Streamlined fundraising features to enable individuals and organizations to quickly raise funds to fulfill immediate needs  for Micro-Solidarity activities such as the purchase of needed aid, transportation of the aid to the place in need, travel expenses for volunteers, etc. Transparency and leanness will be a strong aspect of how fundraising is done, with customization features that make it possible for donors to assign funds to very specific uses within each campaign.
*Extensive user profile creation for individuals, ""expeditions"", grassroots groups and formal non-profits. Functions similar to those used by dating sites like Tinder and Match.com will help individuals connect within the community around specific missions and projects, collaborate and team up. A feature similar to LinkedIn will also enable users to connect with real-world users, build their reputation around solidarity work and interact.
*Customizable platforms for large organizations that would like to engage large groups of volunteers and rally them around specific causes.
Solideer will become the largest online community of solidarity oriented individuals looking to start or collaborate on Solidarity projects and connect with other like-minded individuals. 
WHY?
Traditional public charities can often be cumbersome, inefficient and reactive by nature. A human crisis erupts somewhere in the world; they pass the hat for donations. Weeks or months later they send people to help and material aid, based on how much money they raised. Solideer will change the current status quo by putting the power of change and action in the hands of individuals, not large organizations and by taking money and politics out of the equation. This not only eliminates overhead (an appealing prospect for the every increasing population of jaded, tech savvy millennials interested in global change but frustrated by the inefficacy of large NGOs), but also empowers millions of people to do good on a casual basis. Imagine a world where millions of charitable deeds are done daily, without financial restraints and enabled by technology already available to us!
Solideer will shift the focus from pooling funds for charity into pooling human resources instead. By taking money almost completely out of the equation, solidarity work will be possible on a global scale.
