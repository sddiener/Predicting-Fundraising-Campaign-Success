<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>The F Word</i></p>
<p>My name is Amya Gulati and I am the author of <i>The F Word. </i>This topic can be taboo for many people, depending on their background, and I wanted to write something that I know a lot of people can relate to and find peace in. </p>
<p>I want to help people understand why we still need feminism, why many people turn to it, and why it is a global issue. There are so many facets to the subject and while it is so complex and my book doesn’t even cover the half of it, some insight on feminism could truly change a lot of people’s perspectives and outlooks on life and how we treat others.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about:</p>
<p>- How myths can have a detrimental effect on society </p>
<p>- The increasing numbers in sex work in Russia</p>
<p>- Child marriages in the Middle East</p>
<p>People that are just as passionate about feminism as I am would enjoy this book. I think that people that don’t particularly know a lot about feminism but are open to learning or trying to understand some perspective of it would find the book interesting. The whole idea is that the reader approaches the book with an open-mind- I don’t want people reading this book to feel like they have to agree with me on everything, but I think people that can approach this book with some level-headed thinking and openness would definitely enjoy it more. </p>
<p>The F Word is a non-fiction book that speaks to feminists, those passionate about social issues, and those who may be exploring feminism and gender equality for the first time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book- The F Word </h3>
<p>This book is written in three parts: </p>
<p>Part 1 contains the introduction and additional chapters. I provide the reader with my reasons for writing this book, and why feminism is something that is important to me. Chapters 1 to 7 outline American first-wave feminism and its many evolutions. The first part of the book also outlines insidious societal constructs and practices such as slut-shaming, cat-calling, and rejection in dating. </p>
<p><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 8 to 12. These chapters focus in on sexism and misogyny in traditional cultures such as India, Pakistan, South Africa, and other Middle Eastern countries. It outlines the practice of acid attacks, rape culture, child marriage, and young mothers, and why and how these customs came to be. <br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 13 to 15. This last part of the book takes a look at how poverty especially targets women, regardless of their race, nationality, or ethnicity. Chapter 14 in particular discusses sex work in Russia, and how many women in these Eastern European countries turn to prostitution due to their failing economy and lack of education. </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book.

Good advice—only problem was, I didn’t know what it meant to “be yourself!”</p><p>Maybe you struggled with the same issues and questions at that age. I know I see a lot of preteen and teen girls who do, and that’s what inspired me to develop a special journal just for them: <i>Be Yourself: A Journal for Catholic Girls</i>.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>“Be Who God Meant You To Be!”</strong></h3><p>If you’ve followed my blog, Prayer Wine Chocolate, you know that I am a huge fan of journaling as a means of self-expression and discovery. Like many journals for girls, <i>Be Yourself!</i> offers lots of ways for readers to explore questions about their identity, worthiness, belonging, and purpose. But <i>Be Yourself!</i> also accompanies girls, connecting them with the wisdom of the Catholic Church—and some of its most wise and holy women. Women like St. Catherine of Siena, who said: “Be who God meant you to be, and you will set the world on fire!”</p><p><i>Be Yourself!</i> includes more than 80 pages of fun activities, quizzes, personal “letters” from women saints, and journaling opportunities that girls will love. Quotes from the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> and Scripture provide girls with wisdom from their faith tradition—wisdom that they can use as they explore what it means to “be yourself” in the light of God’s will for them.</p><p>The <i>Be Yourself!</i> journal guides the reader to three essential truths:</p><ol>
<li>That at bottom, her identity is grounded in God’s love for her.</li>
<li>That in God’s sight, she has been beautifully and wonderfully made. (This is such an important truth for girls to embrace, especially at a time when they’re so critical of themselves and others!)</li>
<li>That each girl was made by God for a special purpose—a mission “to be the hands and heart of God”—and that God has provided her with everything she needs to accomplish that mission.</li>
</ol><p>This journal won’t provide girls with any “final answer” to their questions, but my hope is that it will guide them to seek those answers in the light of God’s love, guided by the Church.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Let’s Make Something Beautiful!</strong></h3><p>Speaking of beautifully made . . . in order to make this journal as appealing as possible to girls, we’re hiring a professional book designer: Laurie Nelson, of Agape Design Studios. Laurie’s design work has been delighting kids for more than twenty years. Laurie is working with veteran Catholic artist Vicki Shuck, who will be providing us with portraits of key women saints, as well as gorgeous coloring pages of those saints.</p><p>Together, we’re going to make <i>Be Yourself!</i> a journal that girls will love to read, share, and make their own. You can see some of the <u>preliminary</u> page designs at the bottom of this post.</p><p>In order to get <i>Be Yourself!</i> into the hands of Catholic girls, we need to cover the costs of design and production work. You can help us raise the money we need to move forward by making a donation in exchange for one or more copies of <i>Be Yourself!</i>, or any of the other great thank-you gifts we’re offering as part of this crowdfunding campaign.</p><p>If you can’t give as much as you’d like, don’t worry—whatever you give is a vote of confidence in this project!</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Thank You</strong></h3><p>I want to personally thank you in advance for supporting my passion to help girls discover their beautiful identity in the Lord. My prayer is that your gift to this project connects your heart in a special way to the girl who is struggling to fit in, the girl who questions her self-worth—but who is about to discover joy and confidence in God’s love for her.</p><p> </p><h3>P.S.

<p>In 2010 I traveled to Spain to walk the Camino de Santiago.
I made it a few miles past half way (262 mi.) and got sick (wicked sinus infection from
spending an afternoon in a hyper-smoky bar: it was raining outside, it was
Sunday, and everything else was closed) and after a few days of battling a
worsening condition I ended up flying home to Boise, Idaho. Since then I have
completed my book of the first half of the Camino (a two year process), have
completed what I am calling the Middle Book, which is of my travails and inner
journey since returning, and now I feel I must return to Spain to finish my
walk on the French route (the classic route) to Santiago de Compostela, and
through to Muxia on the Atlantic coast, and then walk the Camino del Norte
also. I am writing of the physical journey, Spain, some of the history, but
more importantly I am writing about my inner journey which can only be accessed
by the endless walk and endless meditative quiet one finds on the Camino. </p>
<p>Walking the Camino de Santiago from Saint Jean Pied du Port
to Santiago de Compostela,  lends itself
to inner exploration. Adding El Camino del Norte, which is less developed,
requiring longer days, offers an opportunity to explore even deeper levels of
insight, pain and endurance. I need to write about it. I need to journal my
days, my feelings, and revelations. I hope to write an enduring novel of a
world class experience which will inspire others to embark on their own spiritual paths. .</p>
<p>As I walk I will email my daily journal entries, and when I
complete the book, those who have donated will receive an autographed copy.</p>

<p>... I grew up living and hearing the same romantic story most young girls in America hear: watch Cinderella, become a member of the girl scouts, study hard in school, become Cinderella, meet the man of your dreams, fall in love, get a great job, have 2.5 babies and live in a cottage made out of gingerbread and candy canes.</p>
<p>Well, none of that happened, no matter how much I held out for that gingerbread cottage!  In fact, by 26, my life was a complete and utter shit show.</p>
<p>I was 40 pounds overweight, had an eating disorder, was struggling with the sudden death of my father and my sister's severe alchoholism, was in one bad relationship after the next and eventually was living in my car! Oh <em>Cinderella,</em> where art thou?!</p>
<p>At 28, I vowed to live life by my own rules, learn from the past, and get out of my Toyota! My way of coping and fighting back was to tell my story to other people, coworkers, friends, and even strangers.</p>
<p>With each person I told my story to, I realized we all go through bullshit, it's called life.  But no one prepares you for it.</p>
<p>So, I began writing down ways to deal with life's challenges. And through the advent of social media, I began posting them. The response I got was overwhelminlg similar, <em>“You should write a book.”</em></p>
<p>So here it is! </p>

<div>I've done a hell of a lot of research over the last two years. And there's one thing that I've learned for sure; shooting for the stars is not cheap.<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, I've decided to do an e-book for two reasons:  one, e-books are the way of the future. But more importantly, e-books keep it environmentally sound!  Less trees, less plastic, more fun!   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After crunching the numbers, $7,500 smackers is what we're looking at for illustrator, graphic designer, editor, etc. to launch this book.  That's where you come in!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am always humbled at the generostiy of the human spirit.  I can't tell you how many people have helped me along during the process of writing this book.  The only way to truly repay them is to get it finished.  But I can't do it alone.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If in any way, you can help support the funding of this book, I will be forever grateful and humbled by your generousity.  </p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mediafire.com/convkey/9dd3/wldylnulu0hxhbsfg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>Social Networking is the best way to show your love and spread the word about the book. </p>
<p>It's easy to do.  Copy and paste the tab just below the video and you can help get the word out.  And then you will be awesome.  And we will love you. </p>

</div></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","It's a long way from Florida, Toto.  When not dazzling the internet with well placed curse words and snarky insights on the state of humankind, Natallia can be found taking long walks with full bottles of red wine, hugging trees or doing ""the worm"" at weddings.  No, really, she does the ""worm"" at weddings.                                                                                               
                          
    Born and raised in Philly.  Cut his teeth in New York.  Now lives in LA.  After spending years in the entertainment biz, Billy is making his transition to co-author and couldn't be more excited.  Other hobbies include making inanimate objects talk, holding his breath when he going through tunnels, and collecting shiny objects.  They make him happy.           
 
                     

 

... I grew up living and hearing the same romantic story most young girls in America hear: watch Cinderella, become a member of the girl scouts, study hard in school, become Cinderella, meet the man of your dreams, fall in love, get a great job, have 2.5 babies and live in a cottage made out of gingerbread and candy canes.
Well, none of that happened, no matter how much I held out for that gingerbread cottage!  In fact, by 26, my life was a complete and utter shit show.
I was 40 pounds overweight, had an eating disorder, was struggling with the sudden death of my father and my sister's severe alchoholism, was in one bad relationship after the next and eventually was living in my car! Oh Cinderella, where art thou?!
At 28, I vowed to live life by my own rules, learn from the past, and get out of my Toyota! My way of coping and fighting back was to tell my story to other people, coworkers, friends, and even strangers.
With each person I told my story to, I realized we all go through bullshit, it's called life.  But no one prepares you for it.
So, I began writing down ways to deal with life's challenges. And through the advent of social media, I began posting them. The response I got was overwhelminlg similar, “You should write a book.”
So here it is! 
 



 







The ultimate goal is to redefine the fairtyale by pulling away the curtain and talking about the real-life B.S. that gets overlooked in school.
This book is a basic survival guide to life in your twenties and thirties; addressing practical skills like health, money, relationships, beauty, happiness, overcoming difficulites and utlimately how to be the best version of yourself.  
Your contribution to this campaign will help bring to life the curriculum that we all wish we learned a long time ago.





One of the books biggest assets is using cartoons to talk about life's bullshit.  
Cartoons get away with a lot more than people.  And rightfully so... they're cartoons! They're fun, and believe it or not, people are more willing to hear advice from a purple horse than an actual person :) Hakuna Matata, anyone?
         




I've done a hell of a lot of research over the last two years. And there's one thing that I've learned for sure; shooting for the stars is not cheap.
 
So, I've decided to do an e-book for two reasons:  one, e-books are the way of the future. But more importantly, e-books keep it environmentally sound!  Less trees, less plastic, more fun!   
 
After crunching the numbers, $7,500 smackers is what we're looking at for illustrator, graphic designer, editor, etc. to launch this book.  That's where you come in!  
 
I am always humbled at the generostiy of the human spirit.  I can't tell you how many people have helped me along during the process of writing this book.  The only way to truly repay them is to get it finished.  But I can't do it alone.  
 
If in any way, you can help support the funding of this book, I will be forever grateful and humbled by your generousity.  

Social Networking is the best way to show your love and spread the word about the book. 
It's easy to do.  Copy and paste the tab just below the video and you can help get the word out.  And then you will be awesome.  And we will love you.

<p>First of all, I don't have the capability to make a video. I do hope you take the time to read.</p>
<p>I've never really been one to ask people for much of anything. In fact, I'm typcially the guy who would much rather starve for a day than muster the words to ask someone for any food. Honestly, if it wasn't for the few good friends I've made over the years, this last last nine months would have probably killed me. I honestly don't know why I'm typing this or even asking complete strangers for anything. In my mind you didn't even click the link to come to this page.</p>
<p>There's just something in this moment telling me not to give up.</p>
<p>Not this time.</p>
<p>You, the complete stranger, are the only thing creating a flicker of optimism in my life right now. It seems fitting we would get to some stuff about me, but before I describe the last year of my life to you or tell you what good things money could do for me. I think maybe you should get to know me - the real me.</p>
<p>I am only twenty-one years old.</p>
<p>I am a writer. Not like those people you know who say they want to someday be a writer, but a mildly genuine writer - as in I'm actually getting published places. I write both dark literary and horror fiction under the pen name Laramore Black. I don't think my real name is vitally important at this current juncture, but all contributors will deserve to know it - that's certain.</p>
<p>In the last year I have accomplished many things for being a poor American Midwest nobody. It's clear to me now that the need to be something to somone - anyone - is one of the only things that kept me going at times. </p>
<p>To begin, with $17 and a half-broken netbook I have built one of the largest upcoming markets for noir fiction on the internet.</p>
<p>You can see this is true here: <a href=""http://slityourwristsmagazine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://slityourwristsmagazine.com</a></p>
<p>Don't let the name scare you. It's really not as terrible as it sounds. It's a website that for the most part simply supports art. Be it writing, photography, artwork, or music. It's still in sort of an embryonic status, but has already surpassed I'd say 90% of the online market in readership.</p>
<p>The idea for the site isn't completely original, but what is, is that it was built from my past experiences. It's an internet hub of people the world has forced to think shouldn't exist anymore. That can be a lot of things though, a controversial opinion, someone always stepped on, the artists left in this world a capitalist society breaks - or someone like me, who is all of the above.</p>
<p>It may not be your <em>cup of tea</em>. You may even hate some of the things myself or people I have staffed have wrote. Maybe dark fiction just isn't your thing. The one thing I can hope anyone can agree on though is an outlet for anyone is a good thing. Any support for creative works is a good thing.</p>
<p>I've also begun doing really good things with the platform.</p>
<p>For instance I am putting together what is called an anthology, which is a collection of short stories from various authors. Kind of like a music sampler, but with writing if you aren't familar with it. The one I'm putting together with SYW has already recieved a ton of submissions from upper mid-list authors and even talented unknowns. This one specifically is called Shock &amp; Appall and is completely for charity.</p>
<p>It's kind of darkly-humorous and ironic that all proceeds will be going to help one person. The profits will go to one person through the organization WorldVision. The reason why may simply be because I can feel empathy for a kid with nothing. To imagine what it'd be like for some kind stranger to step in and help change everything.</p>
<p>You could say I plan to pay it forward to someone the best I can.</p>
<p>Outside of these pursuits and even in the struggle of my daily life I have accomplished quite a bit as a writer. I am a blogger for the Imperial Youth Review. An anthology I was in called Nova Parade is up for a Spinetingler Award. Various amounts of my poetry and stories have been published, or are set to be published in publications across the web. One future publication happens to be a novel excerpt form my someday to be released novel, Autophonomania at a bigger site known as DarkMedia in February. </p>
<p>Autophonomania is a fictional retelling of my battle with suicidal depression. A novel already being talked about amongst publishers. I've also been invited to release a poetry compilation with another press. Really, I think I'm still being modest when I say I have accomplished more than most people my age. I think given the opportunity I could accomplish much more though. Which is why I want to go back to school and have better surroundings.</p>
<p>Something that has probably crossed your mind in reading this is: <em>where are your parents?</em> Well, quite frankly I haven't seen my father in over two years and only recently began a new relationship with my mother. In a family with two boys, three sisters, and three nieces though, you could say my finances are the least of anyone's concerns.</p>
<p>It also leaves no room in a house for someone who left the nest at an early age.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years I have gone through various unfortunate events. Things like the largest tornado that destroyed half my city, a nasty young divorce, that discovery most people prefer chemicals over friendship, and months of struggling with being homeless.</p>
<p>There were times I had to walk 8 miles every day just for a place to sleep. Some days all I ate was a single $1 McDonald's menu item a friend of mine snuck me while I sat in the lobby looking for jobs, reading SYW submissions, and cranking out poem/short story drafts. There were times I sat outside of random businesses with no phone, nowhere to go, in both the heat of the summer and the cold of winter - without a single stranger asking me if I was even okay. No one to really rely on. Just me, a backpack, a half-broken netbook, and two outfits.</p>
<p>Unlike I imagine most people have, there wasn't and isn't anyone to turn to for help. Hell, you can't even sign yourself into a mental hospital when transient it turns out. Luckily, I am in a moderatively better state currently, but it doesn't look like it will last long.</p>
<p>I have had close to five job interviews in the last six months and every one of them haven't hired me. I don't know if it's simply the ongoing depression somehow showing through all those online personality tests, maybe they see something's wrong with me when I come in, maybe they see through the faked positive eyes. No reliable transportation doesn't help my case either, I suppose. I don't know.</p>
<p>What I do know though is this path in life has changed me.</p>
<p>Today I recieved an email that shattered my hopes of this being the last year I have to live like this. An email stating my financial aid reinstatement was disapproved. That their terms and conditions for me to come back would be to pay for a semester out of my own pocket. Which in poor and on the verge of being homeless again terms that means, ""Your future is doomed and we don't care!""</p>
<p>The problem I have with this is I am a storyteller - and like any real writer, I know the truth isn't what Hollywood movies tend to show. I know that email was a ripple to possibly begin the end of my story. That if I don't do things to counteract it, the worst has yet begun.</p>
<p>This is my first, probably failing attempt at that.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How You Can Help:</strong></h2>
<p>Donating, obviously - but I will give you the details below.</p>
<p>It's pretty simple, $950 would be enough to take a couple online courses. This would be the minimum I would need. Regardless of where life takes me I could probably handle a couple courses, even if that means walking miles to the nearest wifi or whatever. A couple good grades in these classes would be enough to raise my GPA back to get financial aid my next returning semester. Getting financial aid back means I can live in the dorms, that I have guaranteed meals, finally focus on my education, and write in a more stress free manner.</p>
<p>The maximum I would ask for is closer to $5500. This would be enough that within a couple weeks I could move back into the dorms and become a full-time student. Anything beyond that would simply be put toward my well being (clothes, food, etc.) and marketing the charities of my own.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How Can This Work?</strong></h2>
<p>My school doesn't require tuition to be paid until the end of January, or for a TuitionPay plan to be intact. I'm going to start classes next week anyway, without books or supplies. The next week or two will decide my plans with how this crowd sourcing goes.</p>
<p>If it stays below $950 I will have to drop my courses and I will put the money toward promoting my charity anthology. If it hits the maximum I will follow through with living on campus and enrolling in more classes. If it ends somewhere between, I will attempt to do full-time enrollment status and live on campus by trying to get into a work-study/TuitionPay program to pay for the rest over time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note: I don't have a proper bank account to verify a paypal account, but you can send any amount to <a href=""mailto:slityourwristsezine@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">slityourwristsezine@gmail.com</a> and I will still give the listed rewards.</p></div>","Typical Sob Story:

If it hits the maximum I will follow through with living on campus and enrolling in more classes. If it ends somewhere between, I will attempt to do full-time enrollment status and live on campus by trying to get into a work-study/TuitionPay program to pay for the rest over time.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I figured my eighth birthday would come and go as the others had, little did I know I would receive a gift that sparked a fire within my soul. Within a small, discreet yellow envelope my parents placed the key to my future, a library card. The library card took me on a magic carpet ride through space and time with nobody but the characters as my companions and the author as my tour guide. My afternoons and weekends were spent surrounded by mounds of classic novels with my cassette player and a pair of headphones to drown out my world so that I could be enveloped within another. These worlds opened the gateway to the possibility of creating my own and brought about the revelation of what I could do when I put a pen to paper. </p>
<p>As my creativity grew so did my love for the written word. The library card opened the door for my individuality to flourish and exceed my own personal expectations but it wasn't until my freshman year of college that I explored the realm of short stories and fiction writing. On my own I wrote short stories, novellas and poems; eventually I pushed myself to achieve as much as I possibly could in regards to my writing and to begin work on my novel. I found myself developing an ability and passion required for thinking outside the box and integrated it with my inherent creativity.<br/>During my evaluation of various masters programs in Creative Writing, I found more success in overseas programs. Studying and traveling abroad has long been one of my objectives and to be able experience the rich and varied cultures of other communities would enhance my understanding of the world's many diverse artistic perspectives. Firsthand knowledge of the international industry would fill the spaces inherent in a purely domestic perspective. By traveling and studying abroad, I would nurture a greater appreciation for the depth of the arts and writing industry and while also gaining the additional experience necessary to distinguish my skills within the business of publishing. The opportunity to study in an international setting will additionally provide the experience of working with people of diverse cultures, thoughts, and talents. To achieve the level defined by my personal career aspirations, it is essential to experience the world of writing at the international level.</p>
<p>Serious consideration for effective and future positions in the industry of a person's choice often requires a master degree within the discipline. Pursuing graduate study in Creative Writing will enhance and define an in-depth knowledge of the components, the management, and the creative and cultural aspects within the industry itself. A rigorous curriculum will provide a deeper understanding and appreciation of this industry's precise and demanding nature. Being a cultural epicenter and a place to call home to literary geniuses such as Charles Dickens, Aldous Huxley, Lewis Carroll, Christopher Marlowe and more, it was obvious that to pursue this dream England was an obvious choice. Random House, HarperCollins and BBC Books (BBC Publishing) are the three firms I have always aspired to work with. Their esteemed resume of accomplished literary artists is one that any company should envy and something I someday hope to be a part of. A friend of mine once said, ""Opportunities within the industry are constantly defined and formulated by those willing to reach beyond established boundaries; to challenge personal limitations."" and throughout my journey I will always tread to the edge of my comfort, breathe deep, and step beyond. </p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to achieve my dream I'll need some outside help!</p>
<ul>
<li>My total cost of attendance is roughly ₤17,000 and I'm only asking for about half of my tuition (Thankfully graduate school in the UK is only 1 year instead of 2)!</li>
<li>$13,000 is my minimum goal but I'm hoping to supercede this in order to help with the rest of the tuition as well as travel expenses.</li>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I am able to achieve this dream I wil have succeeded at what I have been pushing for since I was 10 years old; the publication of my first novel. No matter the amount, from $1-100, any donations will help get me closer to the job of a lifetime in the city of my dreams. If you are in a financial bind and can't donate I totally understand (I lived of Ramen noodles for a good portion of my year) but PLEASE don't hesitate to spread the word in any way possible. I will also be accepting prayers, well wishes and positive joo joo in full force :)</p>

What We Need & What You Get
In order to achieve my dream I'll need some outside help!

My total cost of attendance is roughly ₤17,000 and I'm only asking for about half of my tuition (Thankfully graduate school in the UK is only 1 year instead of 2)!
$13,000 is my minimum goal but I'm hoping to supercede this in order to help with the rest of the tuition as well as travel expenses.



The Impact
If I am able to achieve this dream I wil have succeeded at what I have been pushing for since I was 10 years old; the publication of my first novel. No matter the amount, from $1-100, any donations will help get me closer to the job of a lifetime in the city of my dreams.

<h3>My name is Rasha Hamid. I am a third generation teacher and children's picture books are one of the great loves of my life. </h3>
<p>Children's books about Sudan remain few and far between, and mostly they are about war. (Go ahead, <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=children%27s+picture+book+sudan&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA5ObG7rbVAhWJ2T4KHW85BTcQBQglKAA&amp;biw=1257&amp;bih=655"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">check out this search</a> for picture books about Sudan.)</p>
<p>Several years ago, I was teaching six and seven year olds at an international school in Sudan. At the beginning of a unit of study about Sudan, I asked the children what they already knew about our home country, and they said it was dry, hot, dirty, dusty, and ugly. I sought out picture books to give them a different perspective, but there were few appropriate for young children. We decided then to create our own book, inspired by Christopher Myers' beautiful book <a href=""https://books.google.com/books/about/Black_Cat.html?id=m1DhAAAAMAAJ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black Cat</a>, illustrated with our photographs of Sudan. We called our book <i>Kadisa</i>, using the Sudanese word for cat. </p>
<p><strong>That book inspired <i>Kadisa كديسة. </i></strong></p>
<p>Kadisa كديسة introduces children to Sudan through stunning images of the magnificent and the mundane, with text in English and Sudanese Arabic. Lyrical, conversational text takes the reader through much of the country, and a glossary at the end introduces a few Sudanese Arabic words. Sudan's <a href=""http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/Archive/2004/703/profile.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">King of Jazz</a> and <a href=""https://www.lambiek.net/artists/s/sharhabil_ahmed.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">visual artist</a>, Sharhabil Ahmed contributed his whimsical cat drawings to the illustrations. Several Sudanese photographers shared gorgeous shots of Sudan. In this time of visa bans and Islamophobic rhetoric, Kadisa كديسة offers an alternative image of Sudan - one that is full of light, color and beauty.</p>
<p>Christopher Myers wrote, in <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/opinion/sunday/the-apartheid-of-childrens-literature.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this powerful op-ed</a>, ""[Children] see books less as mirrors and more as maps.

Getting this book out into the world would invite all children to explore and fall in love with Sudan.</p>
<p>In addition to the print version, a planned audiobook version will allow children to hear both English and Sudanese Arabic text read aloud. </p>

Karin is a professional systems engineer and has been the primary driver on our journey from Nashville, across the United States, through Mexico, Central America and back.In 2015, we left our jobs and sold everything we owned to drive from Nashville, Tennessee to the southern tip of South America.  Before we left, we were repeatedly discouraged by others and by the media.  Everyone said these were not safe countries for women to travel in, that a trip like this would be too physically demanding for women, one person even said we would come home in pine boxes. Despite these messages, we overcame our fears and got on the road.  It's been two years and through our travels we discovered SO MANY WOMEN  living lives on the road.  They travel in cars, trucks, motorcycles, vans and bicycles.  They go places most people would never dare to go. They travel by themselves, with spouses, with children, with pets, with each other.  They are corporate professionals, hippies, moms, writers, photographers, yoginis, chefs – they are a lot of things but currently, they are OVERLANDERS.In this book you will DISCOVER:
Who They Are
What They Drive
Where They Are From
What They Have Learned

ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION combined with beautiful photographs from around the world.
We want to introduce you to these women.  They WILL mesmerize you, they will inspire you – they are heroes.What We Need & What You Get""I Can. I Will: Women Overlanding the World"" will not just inspire you through the adventures of these unconventional women, but it is also a collection of photos taken in places that most people don't get an opportunity to see and stories of women doing things that most people will never do. The Impact:Your contribution will allow us to hire and collaborate with a professional editor, a talented designer, and work with the best printer to provide you with a beautiful book that will give these photos the presentation they deserve.""Why a book for women?"" - because we are women.  Because we have been on our own incredible journey and it has made us understand how important it is for women to find empowerment in witnessing other women living their lives outside of societal expectations. But it’s not just for adventurers. It’s for anyone who knows there is more to life than working 9-5, making dinner, watching tv and going to bed every day.  It's for anyone who has looked back at their year and found themselves unable to distinguish one day from the next. We wanted to create an artifact, a springboard. A beautiful thing that takes up space in your life, and nudges you with its presence, urging you to travel and experience the world with an open mind and fresh eyes.  The campaign is priced to make the book as accessible as possible. It includes free shipping in the USA, and similarly subsidized shipping overseas.Once funding is met, we are hoping the book will be ready in time for Christmas.Risks & Challenges:Risks are low.  We are two professional women with a proven track record for completing complex projects. The biggest challenge is the remote locations these women are in, but they have come down from mountains, out of the jungle and through the desert to share their stories, photographs and life-lessons with us. Many of the women involved in this book are published authors, professional photographers and popular writers. Other Ways You Can HelpShare this campaign!  A share is as valuable to us as a contribution.  We appreciate your support in any way you can give it. About The Rewards:The Book:  We will provide you with a high-quality, full color, photo-rich, 200+ page hardcover coffee-table book full of breathtaking photos and stories of women traveling the world by car, truck, van, motorcycle and bicycle.  I can guarantee you that a collection like this DOES NOT EXIST ANYWHERE ELSE! Overlander Coloring Book: Coloring isn't just for kids but for the creative adventurer in all of us.  We have created several coloring pages from pictures throughout our overland travels and of rigs we have encountered on the road. Guatemalan Friendship Bracelet*:  These bracelets are really beautiful. Handmade by local Guatemalans, we purchased a variety of colors and styles while in Antigua. Handmade Mexican Leather Cuff*: Each handmade cuff was made individually, out of fine Mexican leather.  We picked out each one ourselves, making sure each one was unique in both color and design,  directly from the shop of a Mexican leather artisan.  Guatemalan Mini-Masks*: When we saw these tiny masks at Lago de Atitlan, we had to have them. Each one is between 1 and 2 inches tall. The unique art is 100% hand painted and hand carved, made with love and excellent attention to detail by Guatemalan artisans from the town of Chichicastenango. The wood these masks are made from is conscious and approved by the Guatemalan forestry department.  E-book version of the book:   Downloadable version of our book for electronic devices.30-minute Skype Session w/ the Vagabroads:  Ask us anything!  We'll tell you anything you want to know about how we started our adventure, the gear we took, stories from the road, etc.20-minute Skype Session w/ a Woman Featured in the Book:   Meet the women!  Depending upon who is available and not on a mountain somewhere, we will choose a woman featured within the book to speak with you over Skype.*Each perk is ""while supplies last"" and may be substituted for another reward of equal or better value. DON'T FORGET TO CHECK OUT THE CAMPAIGN VIDEO AND PHOTO GALLERY! Follow us and keep in touch!Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/vagabroadsInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/thevagabroadsWebsite:   https://vagabroads.com",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

If you are curious about these, please visit my website at <a href=""http://www.mariafinn.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mariafinn.com</a>. I’m asking for your help with a novel I'm working on, “Sea Legs &amp; Fish Nets” based loosely on my experiences working on a commercial fishing boat in Alaska.</div>
<div>
<p>The crew is four young women who spend a season commercially fishing for salmon on Kodiak Island in order to earn money to pursue their dreams. Some of them become entangled in romantic escapades with men out on the fishing grounds but are also competing with them to catch the fish.  My elevator pitch for it is a literary version of “Sex in the City meets the Deadliest Catch.”  This novel explores how women approach this adrenaline-fueled industry, and how men and women encounter each in places where traditional roles are challenged. As well, it explores how the humbling laws of nature force them rely on each other.</p>
<p>An early draft of it was a finalist for Pen/Bellwether Award that was founded by Barbara Kingsolver for novels that address issues of social justice. My goals with this novel are to encourage all people, but particularly young women, to pursue their dreams—no matter how difficult, poorly thought out, or financially impractical those dreams may be. Also, during my adventures on fishing boats, I fell in love with the Pacific Ocean and I that hope readers also come away with a sense of awe and respect and we all work towards protecting it.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing this novel for the past three years, in-between paid writing work and teaching. It still needs a lot of help, and so at the recommendation of a colleague, I hired a professional editor. Her services are expensive, but she’s edited best sellers like “The Help” and is really good at helping develop tension in the plot and making my characters stronger and more vivid.  I could only afford to hire her for the first 50 pages. I’d really like to work with her on the entire book and also be able to take a few weeks off work to fully concentrate on writing this novel. And so that’s why I’m having this Kickstarter campaign. I’m asking for your help to make this book as good as it can be before I submit it to editors, and to the competition again this year.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t contribute financially, I’d be grateful if you helped by spreading the word and wish me luck.</p>

<h3>Who am I, and what am I wanting to do?</h3>
<p>My name is Tony Faville, and I am the author of a zombie novel titled Kings of the Dead, published by Permuted Press. I am starting on a new project tentatively titled Avery Nolan: Private Dick of the Dead. The idea is based in New York City in the late 1950's and surrounds a KGB plot to destroy the United States from the inside utilizing the living dead.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>My needs and what can I offer you in return..</h3>
<p>It takes a few things to produce a quality story, a good writer with the ability to create the story, an editor to help him polish it, proper research, a good cover and the time to do so. If you help me, you will help me with the editor, the research, the cover artist,  and the ability to write it. I am not going to lie to you, my computer has failed and with everything happening in my life, I do not have the funds to replace it. You will primarily be helping me purchase new means to write, and paying for my editor. At $500 she can be expensive, but she is brutal with the red pen and worth every penny. The artwork itself, for a quality job will run $300-500.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In return, every donor will receive an electronic copy of the book and a thank you in the acknowledgement section of the book. Any donations of $50 will receive a signed paperback copy. Any donations of $100 will receive a signed hardback copy. </p>

<h3>Here's a Short Summary:</h3>
<p>  My name is Jackson and I am an aspiring novelist. I finally have an idea that I feel is worthy of becoming my debut novel - now I just need the financial means. As passionate as I am about writing, I must acknowledge the fact that when it comes to getting published, writing is a business, and one that if I wish to be successfull in, I must be prepared for.<br/> </p>
<p>  This campaign is very important to me because it will dramatically help me realize my dreams and will help me convey things through my writing. Writing has always been something I've been passionate about, but recently I have been looking seriously into writing as a career; I can realistically see myself doing this. I hope to be able to find a way to use my writing to help others, as well. For example, a future goal of mine is to write an eBook and donate all of the profits to charity.<br/> </p>
<p>  As a contributor, you will play a pivotal role in my life and in the life of my works. If I go on to be a best-selling or even relatively successful author, I will owe it to you!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need:</h3>
<p>  To fund my aspirations, I can work with a flexible amount; this is one of those things where anything helps and everything is appreciated.</p>
<p>  If you apply reference texts, a printer (not one of those high-tech 3-D ones, but a printer capable of printing in a quantity comparable to the length of my manuscripts), MS Word, <em>and</em> a MacBook (which isn't something I really need, but I tacked on mainly to meet the minimum goal to be on indiegogo and because if I am fortunate enough to raise the funds necessary, I would probably purchase one), then my goal amount is accurate. However, if you take the MacBook <em>out</em>, then you can cut down my goal amount by at least half.</p>
<p> Here's a prioritized list of potential expendatures:</p>
<ul>
<li>MS Word</li>
<li>Printer</li>
<li>Reference texts</li>
<li>If I have enough, a MacBook<br/>If not, the remainder goes to charity and my college fund/savings</li>
<li>Any extra funds covering the above (including a MacBook, if enough) will go to charity and my college fund/savings</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>   If my goal isn't reached, I will use whatever I have obtained to do what I can and I will establish an alternate method of obtaining the other funds, if needed.</p>
<h3>What You Get (PERKS):</h3>
<p>  Most of my perks are writing-based and involve me writing something tangible for you, so you'll really get your money's worth! I have to admit, all of my perks are pretty awesome, check them out! ----------------------&gt;</p>
<p>  I have options all the way down to $1</p>
<p>  Aside from the tangible perks, you also get my genuine thanks and the knowledge that you helped fund someone passionate about writing and helped that person to become successful.</p>
<h3>Examples of my Work:</h3>
<p>  Here are a few short excerpts of my work. I wrote these and several others while thinking about short stories to write, but the works that these excerpts are from haven't been released yet:</p>

</div></div>","Here's a Short Summary:
  My name is Jackson and I am an aspiring novelist. I finally have an idea that I feel is worthy of becoming my debut novel - now I just need the financial means. As passionate as I am about writing, I must acknowledge the fact that when it comes to getting published, writing is a business, and one that if I wish to be successfull in, I must be prepared for. 
  This campaign is very important to me because it will dramatically help me realize my dreams and will help me convey things through my writing. Writing has always been something I've been passionate about, but recently I have been looking seriously into writing as a career; I can realistically see myself doing this. I hope to be able to find a way to use my writing to help others, as well. For example, a future goal of mine is to write an eBook and donate all of the profits to charity. 
  As a contributor, you will play a pivotal role in my life and in the life of my works. If I go on to be a best-selling or even relatively successful author, I will owe it to you!


What I Need:
  To fund my aspirations, I can work with a flexible amount; this is one of those things where anything helps and everything is appreciated.
  If you apply reference texts, a printer (not one of those high-tech 3-D ones, but a printer capable of printing in a quantity comparable to the length of my manuscripts), MS Word, and a MacBook (which isn't something I really need, but I tacked on mainly to meet the minimum goal to be on indiegogo and because if I am fortunate enough to raise the funds necessary, I would probably purchase one), then my goal amount is accurate. However, if you take the MacBook out, then you can cut down my goal amount by at least half.
 Here's a prioritized list of potential expendatures:

MS Word
Printer
Reference texts
If I have enough, a MacBookIf not, the remainder goes to charity and my college fund/savings
Any extra funds covering the above (including a MacBook, if enough) will go to charity and my college fund/savings

 
   If my goal isn't reached, I will use whatever I have obtained to do what I can and I will establish an alternate method of obtaining the other funds, if needed.
What You Get (PERKS):
  Most of my perks are writing-based and involve me writing something tangible for you, so you'll really get your money's worth! I have to admit, all of my perks are pretty awesome, check them out! ---------------------->
  I have options all the way down to $1
  Aside from the tangible perks, you also get my genuine thanks and the knowledge that you helped fund someone passionate about writing and helped that person to become successful.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Thanks for reading checking this out, i'll try to keep it as brief as possible.  I'm a film director and script writer and although it sounds grand, i've been fortunate enough to make three films, all with micro budgets and great people around me.  I came up with the idea of Amelia when I was quite ill and confined to my bed for a couple of months, unable to walk.  I had just my imagination for company and after a week or two, had Amelia meeting an Elf who lives in a tree in her garden, well where else would they live?</p>
<p>It was intended to be a film, as writing scripts is a lot more straightforward than a book, but the ideas kept flowing and the story was soon developing into a series of challenges on her first adventure with the Elf, Erivon.  It took me a while to get the actual writing going, as had work commitments first, but she was always there, nagging me to start her adventurers, so last year, I began writing Amelia and the Mental Elf.</p>
<p>To date, i'm a little more than half way through and the adventures are coming thick and fast and i'm being helped by working with the most talented and creative illustrator I could have hoped for, Lynn Adams.  She loves the ideas and concepts behind the first 'Amelia' story and her work inspires me to write in greater detail and with more colour.</p>
<p>The sample chapters have so far been well received and i've had some amazing feedback, even comparing me to established and recognised names, which is all very humbling and awkward, but nice nevertheless. Having a certain 'Boy Wizard' brought tears to my eyes.</p>
<p>By helping me financially, it allows me to finish the book without cutting corners, to deliver it to the publisher as agreed, on time, fully illustrated and ready to go.  I've had no support to date and i've been at it now for three months, actual writing that is, the planning and schematics took a little longer than this.</p>
<p>Thanks again for getting this far, I really appreciate it and by helping, you have helped bring a book to life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The support I have asked for is just enough to allow me to work properly, full-time on completing this book. We will obviously need materials for the artwork, which is being worked on now, but the bulk of it allows me to work on something that is incredibly dear to my heart.</p>
<p>I guess it's more impressive to ask for special equipment, technical support or fancy software, but the reality is, I need to be able to work on this completely, to have the time that the support will allow and to be able to write the remainder of the book to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>As for perks, well i've done my level best to offer something unique, including signed films that I have made, first edition illustrated copies of the book, signed if you'd like them to be and hopefully, there's something there for everyboby as a 'thank-you'.</p>
<p>If i don't reach my goal, then it's still helped, in fact it will help me a great deal, just to be able to write without interruption, without worrying about other aspects of life that get in the way too easily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm passionate, obviously, about the book, but it goes a little deeper than that.  With the rise in popularity of computer tablets, books are now more accessible than ever to children and young adults and worlwide literacy at an all time low, so by engaging an young audience, as well as the grown up children amongst us, I believe I can help, just a little bit, to get people engaging with a subject that is enjoyable, fun, moralistic and above all, a good read.</p>
<p>Personally, I still love a good book, on paper, with a cover and enjoy turning the page to read the next line, but by making it acccessible in both paper and electronic formats, means we can access more readers, which is the reason behind writing a book in the first place isn't it?</p>
<p>I was given a copy of the Hobbit when I was young, and it opened my eyes to well written fantasy fiction and i'll always be grateful, just as i'm sure the millions who purchased Harry Potter books will be when they look back and relive their time spent with the young wizard.</p>
<p>I guess i've been reasonably successful as a writer, although previously, it's been scripts, not books.  I have made three films and have another script optioned with a leading independent production company in the UK, who are hopefully going to go into production sometime soon.</p>
<p>I know that many of these campaigns have very impressive videos and all seem very worthwhile, so i'll say it again, ""thank-you"" for sticking with me and getting this far.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand completely if you are not in a position to help, it's a tough time for everyone concerned financially, but if you want to support in other ways, i'd love to have you give me just a little time.</p>
<p>We all have social networks now, twitter, facebook, in fact, there seems to be a new one every week, so if I could ask you to take just a few minutes out of your day to post this to as many pages, groups, followers as you possibly could, it would really help me in the long run.  The more people that know about the book and what i am trying to achieve, then the better it is for the long-term goal of getting this and future 'Amelia' books onto the shelves.</p>
<p>Indiegogo has some pretty easy to use share tools too.</p>
<p>Lynn and I are passionate about Amelia and both consider it our 'dream job', to be able to develop her and future book titles and you are directly helping us to chieve this, so again, from both of us, we say a very big 'Thank-You"".</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) estimates 1.2 million people in the United States (U.S.) are living with HIV infection. One in five (20%) of those people are unaware of their infection. Despite increases in the total number of people in the U.S. living with HIV infection in recent years (due to better testing and treatment options), the annual number of new HIV infections has remained relatively stable. However, new infections continue at far too high of a level, with approximately 50,000 Americans becoming infected with HIV each year.</p>
<p>In 2010, an estimated 47,129 people were diagnosed with HIV infection in the 46 states with confidential name-based HIV infection reporting since at least January 2007. In that same year, an estimated 33,015 people throughout the U.S. were diagnosed with AIDS. Since the epidemic began, an estimated 1,129,127 people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with AIDS.</p>
<p>An estimated 17,774 people with AIDS died in 2009, and nearly 619,400 people with AIDS in the U.S. have died since the epidemic began.</p>
<p>African Americans face the most severe burden of HIV of all racial/ethnic groups in the United States (US). Despite representing only 14% of the US population in 2009, African Americans accounted for 44% of all new HIV infections in that year. Compared with members of other races and ethnicities, African Americans account for a higher proportion of HIV infections at all stages of disease—from new infections to deaths.</p>
<p><strong>The Numbers</strong></p>
<p><strong>New HIV Infections</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2009, black men accounted for 70% of the estimated new HIV infections among all blacks. The estimated rate of new HIV infection for black men was more than six and a half times as high as that of white men, and two and a half times as high as that of Latino men or black women.</li>
<li>In 2009, black men who have sex with men (MSM)<sup><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/aa/index.htm#ref1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1</a></sup>represented an estimated 73% of new infections among all black men, and 37% among all MSM. More new HIV infections occurred among young black MSM (aged 13–29) than any other age and racial group of MSM. In addition, new HIV infections among young black MSM increased by 48% from 2006–2009.</li>
<li>In 2009, black women accounted for 30% of the estimated new HIV infections among all blacks. Most (85%) black women with HIV acquired HIV through heterosexual sex. The estimated rate of new HIV infections for black women was more than 15 times as high as the rate for white women, and more than three times as high as that of Latina women.</li>
</ul><p>Alafia (Peace) I am Khafre K. Abif, AIDS Activist and I have been thriving with HIV for 23 years. I have compiled an anthology of inspirational prayers, poems and affirmations to support the souls and uplift the spirits of People Living with HIV/AIDS.For the last eighteen month the submissions have touched my soul, made me cry, filled me with hope, and connected me to an international community of compassionate contributors who have shared their work to empower my world.</p>
<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Cornbread, Fish and Collard Greens: Prayers, Poems &amp; Affirmation for People Living with HIV/AIDS</span></em> has received submission from Africa, America, Europe, and South America. Contributors have provided their work in their indigenous language with an English translation. I want to shares this anthology with the international community who created it. As you are reading this it is quite possible that you know someone living with HIV/AIDS. If you do then they have shared their status with you. Let us consider all of those who still haven’t disclosed to their mother, father, sister/brother or even their faith community. What place to they go to as a source of support and inspiration?</p>
<p>Poets featured in the forthcoming anthology include: Nikki Grimes, Serena T. Wills, Reginald T. Jackson, Sharaledon D. Brave, r. witherspoon, Samiya Bashir, Storme Webber, Carl Hancock Rux, Tim’m T. West, Mose Xavier Hardin, Jr., Victor R. Pond, Catherine Zickgraf, Temujin Ekunfeo, Maria Hiv Mejia, Sandy Rodgers, W. Travis Wright, Vanessa German, and avery r. young and more. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The idea for the anthology grew out of my work as an HIV Test Counselor. Each time I had to share with someone that they tested positive for HIV one of the first issues for them was disclosure. I believe that there is healing in prayer. I know that word have power. I needed to provide this collection of words that will combat the words that are so often hear spoken to someone with HIV. This is my effort to help combat HIV-related stigma. AIDS-related stigma and discrimination refers to prejudice, negative attitudes, abuse and maltreatment directed at people living with <a href=""http://www.avert.org/hiv.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">HIV</a> and <a href=""http://www.avert.org/aids.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">AIDS</a>. The consequences of stigma and discrimination are wide-ranging: being shunned by family, peers and the wider community, poor treatment in healthcare and education settings, an erosion of rights, psychological damage, and a negative effect on the success of HIV testing and treatment. </p>

<em>Love &amp; Cooking </em>- the erotic cookbook</h3>
<p>Greetings! My name is Tanille Geib, and I'm a <a href=""http://www.tanillephamemariegeib.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lover of humans</a>. I write, direct, produce, teach, cook, laugh, and love in order to connect with people. I love story sharing, love making, and individual growing. This is my project that fuses all of my passions into one.</p>
<p>I have been writing and experiencing Love &amp; Cooking for 5 years, and I'm so thrilled that it is in its last phase.</p>
<p>I have a team of editors, a crazy exciting photographer, and a talented designer to create the look, flow, and feel of the book. Now, I need your help to make this vision a reality.</p>
<p>RECENT UPDATES: I'm VERY excited to have confirmed sponsorship from <a href=""http://www.madeinprint.ca/choose"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Made in Print"">Made In Print</a> for this project! Plus two bookstores in Vancouver who want to carry it!</p>
<div>

</div>
<div>Things are gearing up fast! Currently, I'm working on layout design, photography, artistic content, and editing. These talents cost money, but they're worth it! I'm committed to producing a professional, yet sexy book.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Two more photoshoots, hours of formatting, and planning a book launch! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>PERK AWAY:</div>

<div>
<h3>Why Self-Publishing?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<strong>One:</strong> Because I'm a <span>provocative</span> artist. I don't want to be censored in any way for my first book. I want to release it as authentic as possible. Also, this includes me having complete creative control. Can anyone guess what colour will be most visual in the book?! Could it be PINK?! Yes, it just might be.</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>
<strong>Two:</strong> I'm an entrepreneur. I love problem solving, creating, learning, and achieving the ""impossible"", because I truly believe everything is possible with a hell of a lot of hard work, talent, and more hard work.</div>

 There has never been a work like this done for these people on this scale and we are extremely thankful God would allow our Church to be a part of this amazing ministry.  </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Help us to continue this ministry in </span>excellence<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> as we seek to </span>fulfill<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> the following needs</span></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>Consider helping us to continue this ministry in excellence as we seek to fulfill the following needs:<br/></p><p><b>Metal Building for Community Outreach/Church (estimated $30,000)</b></p><p>Currently we have 3 permanent classrooms attached to a temporary tent.  This tent is crucial to our ministry and is where the children and the rest of the community gathers for various gospel-focused events.  The temporary tent, erected on the dust/dirt of the community, is falling apart and needs to be replaced.  Our goal is to replace it with a metal structure that will become a permanent fixture in our ministry and in the community.</p><p><b>2 Swamp Coolers ($2,524)</b></p><p>Our LightShine building is unbearably hot during the summer.  So hot that when you walk outside into the 100-degree desert, you feel a significant temperature drop!  The heat makes it hard for th skids to concentrate and the teachers to teach.  Having swamp coolers will make classrooms much more comfortable and learning much more effective.</p><p><b>5 Curtains ($375)</b></p><p>The teachers in the Soledad (the Tarahumara community) are using old bed sheets and tablecloths for window coverings in the classrooms.  Having good curtains with linings will beautify and help insulate the classrooms, and more importably will reduce the chance of break-ins in the high-cirme area where we are located.</p><p><b>4 Bookshelves ($488)</b></p><p>It would be an incredible blessing for each classroom in Comunidad Soledad to have its own bookshelf!  We would use the bookshelf to place Bibles, notebooks for the children, additional reading books, etc.</p><p><b>4 Cabinets ($632)</b></p><p>The teachers in Soledad have little or no storage space in their classrooms.  They often have to bring classroom items back and forth from their homes each day.  Having storage would make it much more convenient to access supplies and store classroom materials, and allow greater flexibility during the teaching time.</p><p><b>4 Teacher Desks ($533)</b></p><p>It is hard to be an effective teacher without a desk!  Our teachers in Soledad are in need of additional storage space as well as a large desktop which they can use to set up their lessons and supplies for each class, and which they can use for classroom demonstrations.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Share this campaign with your friends and family</p><p>Commit to pray for the Tarahumara Indians in 2014</p><p>Consider going on RMC's annual short-term mission trip to Mexico in 2014</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/218688/files/20131123140240-405878_591962947481599_565497362_n.jpg?1385244160"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>

</div>","What is LightShine ChristmasLightShine Christmas is about furthering the gospel and church among an unreached people group, the Tarahumara Indians:       ""Alcoholism and drug abuse are rampant among the Tarahumara.  In our experience it is rare to find a Tarahumara man who is not an alcoholic or binge drinker, and the same is true for many Tarahumara women.  The brewing of corn into 'tesguino' has been a cultural facet for many generations.  Although tesguino is still brewed at holidays, beer and hard liquor are a daily or weekly staple.  A very high percentage of the younger generation are addicted to drugs - typically inhalants such as glue and spray paint.  Abuse of various sorts and to various degrees is virtually universal.  At a minimum, many of the children are physically and emotionally neglected.  Physical and sexual abuse is very common."" - Chris Nickerson, LightShine MissionaryAs a church family, Rocky Mountain Calvary, approximately five years ago we sent several families down to Mexico to reach a less reached people group called the Tarahumara Indians.  They are a marginalized people with less than 1% following Jesus and no reproducing church known among them.  Through prayer and stepping out in faith, we have adopted a community (called Soledad, which means loneliness) of Tarahumara Indians in north central Mexico and over the last 3.5 years we have been teaching the children of this community about Jesus.  And more than providing the gospel, we are equipping these children to become the future leaders of their own people.  The impact on this people group has been enormous.  70+ kids gather twice a week for up to 3 hours at the LightShine building to receive instruction in the Bible, hygiene , abuse recovery, life skills, etc.  Through these children families are being reached with the gospel.  The mothers are starting to gather weekly in the LightShine building kitchen to cook and to talk about the Bible.  The Tarahumara people are seeing Jesus and following Him!  There has never been a work like this done for these people on this scale and we are extremely thankful God would allow our Church to be a part of this amazing ministry.  Help us to continue this ministry in excellence as we seek to fulfill the following needsWhat We NeedConsider helping us to continue this ministry in excellence as we seek to fulfill the following needs:Metal Building for Community Outreach/Church (estimated $30,000)Currently we have 3 permanent classrooms attached to a temporary tent.  This tent is crucial to our ministry and is where the children and the rest of the community gathers for various gospel-focused events.  The temporary tent, erected on the dust/dirt of the community, is falling apart and needs to be replaced.  Our goal is to replace it with a metal structure that will become a permanent fixture in our ministry and in the community.2 Swamp Coolers ($2,524)Our LightShine building is unbearably hot during the summer.  So hot that when you walk outside into the 100-degree desert, you feel a significant temperature drop!  The heat makes it hard for th skids to concentrate and the teachers to teach.  Having swamp coolers will make classrooms much more comfortable and learning much more effective.5 Curtains ($375)The teachers in the Soledad (the Tarahumara community) are using old bed sheets and tablecloths for window coverings in the classrooms.  Having good curtains with linings will beautify and help insulate the classrooms, and more importably will reduce the chance of break-ins in the high-cirme area where we are located.4 Bookshelves ($488)It would be an incredible blessing for each classroom in Comunidad Soledad to have its own bookshelf!  We would use the bookshelf to place Bibles, notebooks for the children, additional reading books, etc.4 Cabinets ($632)The teachers in Soledad have little or no storage space in their classrooms.  They often have to bring classroom items back and forth from their homes each day.  Having storage would make it much more convenient to access supplies and store classroom materials, and allow greater flexibility during the teaching time.4 Teacher Desks ($533)It is hard to be an effective teacher without a desk!  Our teachers in Soledad are in need of additional storage space as well as a large desktop which they can use to set up their lessons and supplies for each class, and which they can use for classroom demonstrations.Other Ways You Can HelpShare this campaign with your friends and familyCommit to pray for the Tarahumara Indians in 2014Consider going on RMC's annual short-term mission trip to Mexico in 2014

<h3>Lend a Geek a Hand<br/>
</h3>
<p>Did you know that even after a book is published, authors still have a ton of legwork to do? Promotion, distribution, and advertising is pretty much up to the writer, especially if (like me) you're the new guy. <br/></p>
<p>This is why your help is so important. Instead of hoping that the right person will stumble upon my book online, I want to get my book to people who will appreciate it. This is a superhero novel, so when you buy your copy and are wondering where you want to send the other to, think of where comic book fans in your town tend to congregate. Comic shops, game shops, hobby shops... A lot of these are small, independently owned businesses and I simply can't find them all on my own.</p>
<p>If you're a regular in your shop, you can ask if it's okay for me to send one. Even if they don't want to stock my book for sale, it's still a free book. What nerd in their right mind says ""No"" to a free book?<br/></p>
<p>Whether you send one to a local store, to a friend, or even to a library as a donation, thank you. You're heroes to me.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>So Where's the Money Going?<br/>
</h3> <p>$5000 is a serious chunk of change, so here's what we're going to do with it:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>60% - 1000 BOOKS!<br/>
</li>
<li>15% - Your Kickbacks! Bonus - All of these kickbacks are being printed/crafted by small, locally owned businesses. By supporting me, you're supporting them as well. How cool is that?  <br/>
</li>
<li>10% - Mail All The Things!<br/>
</li>
<li>4-9% - Indiegogo/PayPal/etc. This varies depending on whether or not we hit our goal.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What about the extra 8ish percent? It goes to cover anything else that pops up, be it a bump in shipping prices, unexpected printing errors or whatever other wrench gets thrown in our plans. It's better to plan for these kinds of things. Contingency!<br/></p>
<p>If things go smoothly and our math holds true, then it'll go to promote the book even more! I can hire artists to create some amazing art, get tables at conventions, print business cards, get signage - The list goes on. If we exceed our goal, this is where it's going to go.<br/></p>
<p>Even if we don't hit our goal, we're still printing 1000 books. It'll be kick in the wallet, but we're doing it.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Not only are you helping me spread the word about my book, you're also helping me write ""The Single Deed of Emeril Battles,"" which is the sequel. My publisher is interested in it, but only if this book does well. If my publisher gets a bunch of shops calling them up and asking for books to sell, they'll know things are going great.<br/><br/>On a more basic level, you're helping me put food on the table for my family. I get a little bit of money for each book sold, whether it be online through Amazon or via a wholesale order placed by a shop with my publisher. Getting my book published was literally a dream come true, but making a living as a writer would be paradise.<br/><br/><i>Psst - There's a teaser for the next book in the back of your copy.</i><br/>

This is a superhero genre novel written by Brian Hagan in 2008 and published in 2014 by Fantastic Journys Publishing. From the back of the book:




""Horace
Pickle hates mashed potatoes, but now he has a plan.

Windsmith City is home to Baron, one of the world’s greatest
heroes, who has decided to take his first vacation after decades of heroic
service. But while Baron is enjoying himself in sunny Argentina, a new villain

Did you know that even after a book is published, authors still have a ton of legwork to do? Promotion, distribution, and advertising is pretty much up to the writer, especially if (like me) you're the new guy. 
This is why your help is so important. Instead of hoping that the right person will stumble upon my book online, I want to get my book to people who will appreciate it. This is a superhero novel, so when you buy your copy and are wondering where you want to send the other to, think of where comic book fans in your town tend to congregate. Comic shops, game shops, hobby shops... A lot of these are small, independently owned businesses and I simply can't find them all on my own.

What about the extra 8ish percent? It goes to cover anything else that pops up, be it a bump in shipping prices, unexpected printing errors or whatever other wrench gets thrown in our plans. It's better to plan for these kinds of things. Contingency!
If things go smoothly and our math holds true, then it'll go to promote the book even more! I can hire artists to create some amazing art, get tables at conventions, print business cards, get signage - The list goes on. If we exceed our goal, this is where it's going to go.
Even if we don't hit our goal, we're still printing 1000 books. It'll be kick in the wallet, but we're doing it.
  The ImpactNot only are you helping me spread the word about my book, you're also helping me write ""The Single Deed of Emeril Battles,"" which is the sequel.

Everything from cramps, bloating, PMS, period poops, menopause, pads, period underwear, tampons, period showers…to the experience of using tampons, managing periods and period leaks.Can I expect a little nudity?Yes! Nudity is classy and intentional.What are the specs of the book?I plan to create a softcover book: 6”x9” and 30+ pages of illustrations.How will you spend the money you raise on IndieGogo?Production: Printing and shipping the book.What are the risks/challenges of this project?Though many pages are done, the book is still a work in progress: I will edit it and replace/add illustrations. I welcome your ideas too: Email me at hello@andrealyip.com. Following that, I'll be working with a printer and prepping the books to ship out to you. I don't anticipate any major road blocks but will keep you informed if anything comes up.What is your timeline?November '16: IndieGogo Campaign!December '16: Edit/add imagesJanuary '17: Finalize book designFebruary '17: Print the book and get it ready to shipMarch '17: Shipments out!Are you working with anyone on this?I have been working closely with my partner, Wojciech, who is helping me manage the 'behind-the-scenes' logistics of this campaign.

U mjesec dana njezinog trajanja prikupili smo novac za rad u tekućoj godini. Točan iznos prikupljenog novca objavit ćemo nakon što podvučemo crtu pod račun protekloga mjeseca. Okvirno možemo reći da je u kampanji prikupljeno, nadamo se, blizu 40.000 dolara. Ono što želimo naglasiti jeste da su vaše donacije, riječi podrške i solidarni, drugarski angažman u našoj kampanji pretvorili borbu za opstanak u festival optimizma. Bez lažne skromnosti možemo reći: Lupiga nikad nije bila jača, naša redakcija odavno nije imala ovoliko elana i volje za rad. U kampanji nismo dobili samo novac. Dobili smo krila. </strong></p><p>Hvala vam za sve, ostanite s nama.  </p><p><strong>20.01. 2018. Vaša Lupiga</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">________________________________________</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Dragi ljudi na svim stranama svijeta, na istoku, sjeveru, zapadu i jugu. Lupiga je uspjela! </strong></p><p>Uspjeli smo u deset dana doći do cilja i osigurati polovicu minimalnog iznosa za osnovno funkcioniranje redakcije. Na Indiegogo platformi ostalo nam je<strong> još 21 dan kampanje</strong>. Moramo priznati, takav val solidarnosti nismo očekivali. Nismo očekivali da toliki broj ljudi i organizacija razumije kakvu potrebu društvo ima za slobodnim novinarstvom, za novinarstvom bez gazde. Nismo znali da je Lupiga u ovakvoj mjeri prepoznata kao adresa takvog novinarstva. </p><p>Znali smo koliko smo čitani, ali nismo, međutim, znali da među našim čitateljima i čitateljicama ima toliko onih kojima je do Lupige stalo do te mjere da su iz vlastitog džepa spremni financirati naš rad. <strong>Podcijenili smo i sebe i vas</strong>. Podcijenili smo činjenicu da ima dovoljno razboritih ljudi, koji ne pristaju na pranje mozga. Priznajemo da smo iznenađeni i zatečeni. Zahvaljujući vašoj podršci, u novu godinu ulazimo mirniji i hrabriji, ali i ambiciozniji da se posvetimo novinarstvu do kojeg nam je svima stalo. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514579595/d3jim82ctzec8pj93bf5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Sada nam<strong> nije ostalo ništa drugo nego da idemo do kraja</strong>. Ono što prikupimo do 19. siječnja, do kraja kampanje, <strong>mogao bi biti jedini izvor financiranja</strong> do neodređeno udaljenog nam datuma. Stoga ćemo postaviti novi cilj, <strong>dodatnih 9.999 dolara</strong>. Uspijemo li skupiti i ovaj iznos, što bi za naše pojmove i financijske okvire u kojima se trenutno krećemo bilo ravno znanstvenoj fantastici, sav novac utrošit ćemo na <strong>angažman novih autora</strong>, koji su na našim prostorima također prepoznati kao adresa dobrog i beskompromisnog novinarstva. Imena autora i autorica koji su do sada objavljivali na Lupigi nećemo bacati pred vas kao mamac, jer svaki autor i autorica podjednako su nam važni. Baš kao i svaki čitatelj i svaka čitateljica. Možemo vam tek garantirati da ćete od ljudi koji pristanu na suradnju s Lupigom dobiti iskrene i argumentirane stavove. S nekima od njih ćete se složiti, s nekim drugima nećete, ali i u jednom i u drugom slučaju bit ćete sigurni da ste pročitali autentično mišljenje, iza kojeg ne stoje zadnje namjere kao što su reklamiranje, prikrivanje, manipuliranje i sve ono čega smo se u javnom prostoru nagledali za deset života. </p><p>Idemo dalje s kampanjom, zato jer želimo biti snažno prisutni u javnom prostoru, zato jer želimo biti jaki, zato jer <strong>želimo stajati na položajima </strong>s kojih su gazde većine medija i njihovi politički i kontroverzni poduzetni partneri odavno naredili povlačenje. Idemo dalje zato <strong>jer vidimo da nas ima</strong> i zato jer ovu priliku ne možemo propustiti. Znamo da iduću nećemo dobiti tako skoro. Ima nas!

Tako je govorio Albert Camus, filozof, pisac i veliki novinar. Prije 16 godina, kad smo počinjali, velike nam riječi nisu značile ništa. Činilo nam se da svijet funkcionira baš kako treba funkcionirati. U internet klubu Lupillus napravili smo portal <a href=""http://lupiga.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lupiga.Com</a>. Tadašnji početnici iz gradskih rubrika kod nas su napisali prve kolumne i stekli prve redovne čitatelje. Tu je <a href=""http://lupiga.com/kolumne/bosanac-u-zagrebu-predrasude"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Edo Maajka</a> bacao prve zagrebačke rime, Marčelo iz Beograda slao prve <a href=""http://www.lupiga.com/kolumne/prolece-i-smrt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">literarne pokušaje</a>. Tu su na grubom brušenju bili današnji televizijski producenti i svoje talente otkrivali sadašnji audio-vizualni stručnjaci. Neki su ubrzo lansirani među zvijezde, a Lupiga je već 2004. godine dobila nagradu VIDI Top ten u kategoriji medija. </p><p>Pred nama se otvarao jasan put ka uspjehu, možda i zaradi: pisati kratke tekstove o svemu i svačemu, s naglaskom na<strong> plitke afere i duboke dekoltee</strong>. Tako smo se mogli nadati nekoj zaradi. Ali, nismo mogli pisati kratke vijesti, naročito ne o plitkim aferama i dubokim dekolteima. Nismo tako zamišljali novinarstvo. Bila bi to uvreda svemu u što smo vjerovali: uvreda Feralu i lavovskoj novinarskoj borbi Drage Hedla, raskošnom stilu Igora Mandića, rečenici Veselka Tenžere, građanskoj hrabrosti Ankice Lepej, znatiželjnom, istraživačkom duhu Jasne Babić... </p><p>Na ""pravom"" poslu radili smo udarnički, u slobodno vrijeme na Lupigi - <strong>volonterski</strong>. I tako 12 godina. Lupiga je bivala sve veća i veća. I onda dolazi ta 2013. godina kada smo dobili potporu Ministarstva kulture. Naša mala neprofitna medijska scena je jačala. Sa skromnom državnom potporom izrastao je cijeli niz medija <strong>bez lažnih vijesti i dubokih dekoltea</strong>. Zanimalo nas je istraživačko novinarstvo, mukotrpno kopanje po <a href=""http://lupiga.com/vijesti/matematika-vjere-imamo-konacnu-cifru-kojom-porezni-obveznici-placaju-vatikanske-sporazume"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">troškovima Katoličke crkve</a>, <a href=""http://www.lupiga.com/vijesti/povijesna-obmana-naroda-sto-nam-je-to-dala-velebna-privatizacija"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">skandalozne privatizacije</a>, <a href=""http://lupiga.com/vijesti/tko-je-ugasio-svjetlo-nekad-smo-zarulje-izvozili-na-zapad-a-danas-ih-godisnje-uvozimo-za-preko-30-milijuna-eura"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nestale tvrtke</a>, <a href=""http://www.lupiga.com/vijesti/lupigin-serijal-nedodirljivi-ivica-todoric-prvi-medju-nejednakima"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Todorić u vrijeme</a> dok je u džepu <a href=""http://lupiga.com/vijesti/ivica-todoric-nadmasio-samog-sebe-ministarstvo-zdravlja-zabranjuje-da-se-u-konzumima-pacijentima-vadi-krv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">imao ministre i premijere</a>, zapostavljena kultura i umjetnost,pregaženi u ovom sistemu, rodna, nacionalna i ekonomska ravnopravnost… Čitanost je rasla.

O da, danas vjerujemo da nam <strong>velike riječi o slobodnom novinarstvu nisu ostavljene slučajno</strong>. Ostavljene su kao upozorenje. Dobro novinarstvo jest jedan od stupova zdravog društva. Zato želimo pisati o ozbiljnim stvarima, objavljivati istraživačke serijale i prokazivati anomalije našeg društva, društva u kojem je moguće da su ratni <a href=""http://lupiga.com/vijesti/u-sjeni-komemoracije-za-slobodana-praljka-zapaljene-svijece-zrtvama-zlocina"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">zločinci heroji</a> i u kojem politika i kapital nezaustavljivo <a href=""http://www.lupiga.com/vijesti/zakon-o-koncesijama-danas-je-sabor-omogucio-novi-krug-velike-pljacke-hrvatske"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nasrću na javna dobra</a>.

It seemed like the world was on the right track. A group of journalists, friends and colleagues who met up regularly at Lupillus, their favorite watering hole in Zagreb, decided to put together <a href=""http://lupiga.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lupiga.com</a>. Rookie journalists would break their first stories and run their first columns on Lupiga, and build a loyal readership.</p><p>This was where Edo Maajka, a rapper from Bosnia, put together his first Zagreb rhymes. Marčelo from Belgrade sent us his first literary attempts. This is where some of today's TV producers tested their journalistic prowess, and some audio-visual artists discovered their talents. Some of them ended up launching star-studded careers, and by 2004 Lupiga won the VIDI Top ten media award.<br/> <br/>A path to success was opening for us, to big money perhaps: all we needed to do was write short stories about everything and nothing, about shallow corruptive affairs and deep cleavages. But we don't see journalism that way. It would be a disgrace to everything we believe in; an insult to Feral Tribune and the persistent fight of our colleague Drago Hedl, an affront to Igor Mandic's splendid writing style and to Veselko Tenzera's sentences, a slight to whistleblower Ankica Lepej's citizen courage, an indignity to Jasna Babić's curiosity and investigative spirit.</p><p>At our ""real"" jobs (read: full-time day jobs) we worked like hell – but our free time and our passion belonged to Lupiga. It continued for the next 12 years. Lupiga grew bigger and bigger. Then came the end of 2013, and for the first time Lupiga received a grant from the Ministry of Culture.

U mjesec dana njezinog trajanja prikupili smo novac za rad u tekućoj godini. Točan iznos prikupljenog novca objavit ćemo nakon što podvučemo crtu pod račun protekloga mjeseca. Okvirno možemo reći da je u kampanji prikupljeno, nadamo se, blizu 40.000 dolara. Ono što želimo naglasiti jeste da su vaše donacije, riječi podrške i solidarni, drugarski angažman u našoj kampanji pretvorili borbu za opstanak u festival optimizma. Bez lažne skromnosti možemo reći: Lupiga nikad nije bila jača, naša redakcija odavno nije imala ovoliko elana i volje za rad. U kampanji nismo dobili samo novac. Dobili smo krila. Hvala vam za sve, ostanite s nama.  20.01. 2018. Vaša Lupiga________________________________________Dragi ljudi na svim stranama svijeta, na istoku, sjeveru, zapadu i jugu. Lupiga je uspjela! Uspjeli smo u deset dana doći do cilja i osigurati polovicu minimalnog iznosa za osnovno funkcioniranje redakcije. Na Indiegogo platformi ostalo nam je još 21 dan kampanje. Moramo priznati, takav val solidarnosti nismo očekivali. Nismo očekivali da toliki broj ljudi i organizacija razumije kakvu potrebu društvo ima za slobodnim novinarstvom, za novinarstvom bez gazde. Nismo znali da je Lupiga u ovakvoj mjeri prepoznata kao adresa takvog novinarstva. Znali smo koliko smo čitani, ali nismo, međutim, znali da među našim čitateljima i čitateljicama ima toliko onih kojima je do Lupige stalo do te mjere da su iz vlastitog džepa spremni financirati naš rad. Podcijenili smo i sebe i vas. Podcijenili smo činjenicu da ima dovoljno razboritih ljudi, koji ne pristaju na pranje mozga. Priznajemo da smo iznenađeni i zatečeni. Zahvaljujući vašoj podršci, u novu godinu ulazimo mirniji i hrabriji, ali i ambiciozniji da se posvetimo novinarstvu do kojeg nam je svima stalo. Sada nam nije ostalo ništa drugo nego da idemo do kraja. Ono što prikupimo do 19. siječnja, do kraja kampanje, mogao bi biti jedini izvor financiranja do neodređeno udaljenog nam datuma. Stoga ćemo postaviti novi cilj, dodatnih 9.999 dolara. Uspijemo li skupiti i ovaj iznos, što bi za naše pojmove i financijske okvire u kojima se trenutno krećemo bilo ravno znanstvenoj fantastici, sav novac utrošit ćemo na angažman novih autora, koji su na našim prostorima također prepoznati kao adresa dobrog i beskompromisnog novinarstva. Imena autora i autorica koji su do sada objavljivali na Lupigi nećemo bacati pred vas kao mamac, jer svaki autor i autorica podjednako su nam važni. Baš kao i svaki čitatelj i svaka čitateljica. Možemo vam tek garantirati da ćete od ljudi koji pristanu na suradnju s Lupigom dobiti iskrene i argumentirane stavove. S nekima od njih ćete se složiti, s nekim drugima nećete, ali i u jednom i u drugom slučaju bit ćete sigurni da ste pročitali autentično mišljenje, iza kojeg ne stoje zadnje namjere kao što su reklamiranje, prikrivanje, manipuliranje i sve ono čega smo se u javnom prostoru nagledali za deset života. Idemo dalje s kampanjom, zato jer želimo biti snažno prisutni u javnom prostoru, zato jer želimo biti jaki, zato jer želimo stajati na položajima s kojih su gazde većine medija i njihovi politički i kontroverzni poduzetni partneri odavno naredili povlačenje. Idemo dalje zato jer vidimo da nas ima i zato jer ovu priliku ne možemo propustiti. Znamo da iduću nećemo dobiti tako skoro. Ima nas! Još uvijek nas ima dovoljno!#ImanasJOŠ*** Lupigi možete donirati i izravno na žiro-račun, putem opće uplatnice ili internetskog bankarstva. Podatke možete pronaći na ovom linku.

Tako je govorio Albert Camus, filozof, pisac i veliki novinar. Prije 16 godina, kad smo počinjali, velike nam riječi nisu značile ništa. Činilo nam se da svijet funkcionira baš kako treba funkcionirati. U internet klubu Lupillus napravili smo portal Lupiga.Com. Tadašnji početnici iz gradskih rubrika kod nas su napisali prve kolumne i stekli prve redovne čitatelje. Tu je Edo Maajka bacao prve zagrebačke rime, Marčelo iz Beograda slao prve literarne pokušaje. Tu su na grubom brušenju bili današnji televizijski producenti i svoje talente otkrivali sadašnji audio-vizualni stručnjaci. Neki su ubrzo lansirani među zvijezde, a Lupiga je već 2004. godine dobila nagradu VIDI Top ten u kategoriji medija. Pred nama se otvarao jasan put ka uspjehu, možda i zaradi: pisati kratke tekstove o svemu i svačemu, s naglaskom na plitke afere i duboke dekoltee. Tako smo se mogli nadati nekoj zaradi. Ali, nismo mogli pisati kratke vijesti, naročito ne o plitkim aferama i dubokim dekolteima. Nismo tako zamišljali novinarstvo. Bila bi to uvreda svemu u što smo vjerovali: uvreda Feralu i lavovskoj novinarskoj borbi Drage Hedla, raskošnom stilu Igora Mandića, rečenici Veselka Tenžere, građanskoj hrabrosti Ankice Lepej, znatiželjnom, istraživačkom duhu Jasne Babić... Na ""pravom"" poslu radili smo udarnički, u slobodno vrijeme na Lupigi - volonterski. I tako 12 godina. Lupiga je bivala sve veća i veća. I onda dolazi ta 2013. godina kada smo dobili potporu Ministarstva kulture. Naša mala neprofitna medijska scena je jačala. Sa skromnom državnom potporom izrastao je cijeli niz medija bez lažnih vijesti i dubokih dekoltea. Zanimalo nas je istraživačko novinarstvo, mukotrpno kopanje po troškovima Katoličke crkve, skandalozne privatizacije, nestale tvrtke, Todorić u vrijeme dok je u džepu imao ministre i premijere, zapostavljena kultura i umjetnost,pregaženi u ovom sistemu, rodna, nacionalna i ekonomska ravnopravnost… Čitanost je rasla. Najbolji je to dokaz da društvo ne traži samo guzice i sise.Kada je jedna garnitura smijenila drugu, mi smo bili prvi na dnevnom redu. Novinarstvo kakvo mi želimo njegovati nije po ukusu moćnih. Ne treba istraživati, treba zabavljati; ne treba kritizirati, treba kombinirati. Ne treba zabadati nos u tuđe poslove i propitivati kakvo smo društvo stvorili i kakvim ćemo ga ostaviti za svoju djecu. Nama se, ipak, čini da je novinarstvo ""pisanje onoga što drugi ne žele objaviti"", a da su ""sve drugo tek odnosi s javnošću"", kako je to rekao drugi veliki novinar, George Orwell. O da, danas vjerujemo da nam velike riječi o slobodnom novinarstvu nisu ostavljene slučajno. Ostavljene su kao upozorenje. Dobro novinarstvo jest jedan od stupova zdravog društva. Zato želimo pisati o ozbiljnim stvarima, objavljivati istraživačke serijale i prokazivati anomalije našeg društva, društva u kojem je moguće da su ratni zločinci heroji i u kojem politika i kapital nezaustavljivo nasrću na javna dobra. Samo na taj način možemo ga i znamo činiti boljim. Želimo dati prostor ljudima koji imaju što reći i pokazati. Tijekom godine na izmaku, Lupiga ne samo da je uspjela preživjeti, nego je bila i vrlo vidljiva u javnom prostoru, otvarala teme i davala drugačiji pogled na društvene probleme. U toj su godini dvije naše novinarke - Melisa Skender i Jasna Babić - dobile godišnje nagrade Hrvatskog novinarskog društva. Živjeli smo na pogon novinarske strasti i podrške prijatelja. Sad se obraćamo vama, našim čitateljima i čitateljicama, simpatizerkama i simpatizerima, svima koji vjeruju da je važno pomoći da se na životu održi jedan slobodan medij. Želimo vam svakog dana iduće godine predstaviti barem jednu ozbiljnu temu - ozbiljnim tekstom, fotografijom i videom, koji neće sramotiti profesiju. Po jedan dobar tekst svih 365 dana. Novac koji pokušavamo skupiti, naravno, nije dovoljan da pokrije realnu, poštenu, cijenu svih tih tekstova, stoga će Lupiga osigurati ostatak, po principu – pola mi, a pola vi.Sav prikupljen novac namijenit ćemo isključivo našim suradnicama i suradnicima, kao naknadu za njihov rad. Cilj je da Lupiga ostane neovisna redakcija, koju nitko ne može spriječiti da govori o temama o kojima se u našem društvu izbjegava govoriti - o političkim moćnicima i ljudima koji vjeruju da novcem mogu platiti i javnu šutnju. Danas je jasno da slobodan može biti samo onaj medij čiji su jedini vlasnici njegovi čitatelji i novinari. Medij bez gazde.Na ovom mjestu zahvaljujemo svim našim kolegama, prijateljima i simpatizerima koji su nam pomogli u pripremi ove kampanje. Pozivamo u pomoć sve vas koji znate da bez slobodnog novinarstva nema ni slobodnog društva. Nikada nismo jedni drugima bili potrebniji. Donirajte Lupigu, zajedno ćemo biti glasniji. *** Lupigi možete donirati i izravno na žiro-račun, putem opće uplatnice ili internetskog bankarstva.

It seemed like the world was on the right track. A group of journalists, friends and colleagues who met up regularly at Lupillus, their favorite watering hole in Zagreb, decided to put together Lupiga.com. Rookie journalists would break their first stories and run their first columns on Lupiga, and build a loyal readership.This was where Edo Maajka, a rapper from Bosnia, put together his first Zagreb rhymes. Marčelo from Belgrade sent us his first literary attempts. This is where some of today's TV producers tested their journalistic prowess, and some audio-visual artists discovered their talents. Some of them ended up launching star-studded careers, and by 2004 Lupiga won the VIDI Top ten media award. A path to success was opening for us, to big money perhaps: all we needed to do was write short stories about everything and nothing, about shallow corruptive affairs and deep cleavages. But we don't see journalism that way. It would be a disgrace to everything we believe in; an insult to Feral Tribune and the persistent fight of our colleague Drago Hedl, an affront to Igor Mandic's splendid writing style and to Veselko Tenzera's sentences, a slight to whistleblower Ankica Lepej's citizen courage, an indignity to Jasna Babić's curiosity and investigative spirit.At our ""real"" jobs (read: full-time day jobs) we worked like hell – but our free time and our passion belonged to Lupiga. It continued for the next 12 years. Lupiga grew bigger and bigger. Then came the end of 2013, and for the first time Lupiga received a grant from the Ministry of Culture. Out small nonprofit community began to thrive. With just a small financial injection, we created a brand new media environment – a website that rose to prominence without fake news or „titty bait“.We were into investigative journalism, digging through Catholic church finance, scandalous takeovers of public companies, an industry brought to its knees. We wrote about Croatian oligarchs, the neglected cultural scene, about people being run over by the system, about gender, national and economic equality – and our audience grew. And it was the obvious proof that the public isn't only interested in tits and ass.When the political climate shifted, free media was the first to face cuts. Journalism as we see it did not satisfy the tastes of those in power. They fancy entertainment over journalism, obscure arrangements over vocal criticism. We're not supposed to stick our noses into their businesses or question what kind of society we are leaving to our children.But for us, it seemed that journalism ""is printing what someone else does not want printed“ and that „everything else is public relations”, like anoother great journalist, George Orwell, said. Today we know that those words were not left to us by chance. They were left to us as warnings. Free press is one of the supporting pillars of a healthy society – but a pillar that needs support as well. That's why we want to write about what matters, in-depth investigative stories, pointing out anomalies in society – a society that allows convicted war criminals to become heroes, while politics and big money exploit public good. It's the only way we can make it better. By providing space – and a platform – for people who have something to say.In the year we leave behind, Lupiga not only managed to survive, but offered new perspectives, opening important discussions.

<p>Hello, my name is Dorlan Francis. I am a Personal Financial Advisor. I am the holder of the Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) and the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designations. I also hold the Canadian Securities Course Certificate (CSc.) I have been in the Personal Financial Advising business since 1981.</p>
<p>I am the author of a previous book, <strong>LIFE INSURANCE: The <em>Cause</em> of Economic Prosperity</strong>. This was self-publish through Xlibris.com. It contained compelling financial and economic information. And it brought to light discoveries that where heretofore undetected. As Randal Whittle said, when he commented about the book on Amazon.com, ""5 out of 5 stars. Fascinating and Enlightening—more people should understand what it contains. ..."" It is a book with excellent ideas but it is not reaching the people who should have it because of marketing challenges due to funding constraints.</p>
<p>I have since written another book: <strong><em>The Economic and Financial Crisis (2007 - Present) How We Got In: How We Get Out.</em></strong> This book is more mind boggling. It contains earth shattering information. It shows how cunning men who past themselves off as wise, are pretending to give people what they want as they exploit people for their own benefit and in the process is causing global financial mayhem. This is causing the average individual to become poorer as a handful of people amass wealth out of all proportions to the effort they contribute to society.</p>
<p>This book is hard hitting. It name names. It shows up people who think their ideas are brilliant but are instead sowing destruction around the globe. No established publisher is going to touch it. Apart from the fact that I call names and will insist that names be called, most of the publishing houses are run by the same clique of people who are plundering and pillaging from the many for the benefit of a few. They are not likely to support a book that will rock the boat. In any event they are only interested in publishing people with name recognition. Even though often times what these recognised individuals say is harmful. They are more interested in making profits than to educate and inform; and in bringing new thinking to light. I am not encouraged by self-publishing as currently practised. I am not pleased with the outcome of my first work. If I have to pay for all marketing and promotion then I might as well maintain total control over production and distribution. This is what I intend to do but I need your help.</p>
<p>Your valuable contributions will be used to do the following:</p>
<p>Editing  ......................................... $2,500.00 - $3,000.00</p>
<p>Typesetting &amp; Graphic Design .......... $2,500.00 - $3,000.00</p>
<p>Book Printing &amp; Distribution ….........… $15,000.00 - $20,000</p>
<p>(the quantity of books print at a time will vary depending on the availability of funds. The greater the quantity the lower the unit cost per book)</p>
<p>Marketing and Promotion .......................... $5,000.00</p>
<p>The $30,000 target is to do 5,000 Hardcover Copies of the book in the first run. If there is a short fall in funding then I will do a lesser amount of copies (minimum 1000). If the goal is exceeded then I will do more copies of the book and embark on a more aggressive marketing campaign.</p>
<p> Your contributions will help to change the world. You will be among the first to know about ideas that the rest of the world will sooner or later accept as orthodox truths. You will know why life has gotten so hard; why the income of the average individual keeps falling while the income of a few keeps rising. You will find out for the first time at last what caused the great depression and how the very same ideas caused a repeat in 2007. You will know why youngsters leaving universities with their first and second degrees have to be doing menial jobs to survive. You will be armed with the knowledge with which to lobby your political representatives to get them to effect change so that the future for your children and children's children will indeed be better than the past.</p>
<p>       You might be asking yourself: What can a personal financial advisor know about economics? And I would hasten to ask: What do economists know about economics? Studies have shown that economists are unable to predict economic out comes 99% of the times. John Mauldin wrote an article in the Newsletter: <em>Thoughts From The Frontline</em> with the caption: Economists Are (Still) Clueless. In that article he stated the following:</p>
<p>        ""In November of 2008, as stock markets crashed around the world, the Queen of England visited the London School of Economics to open the New Academic Building. While she was there, she listened in on academic lectures. The Queen, who studiously avoids controversy and almost never lets people know what she's actually thinking, finally asked a simple question about the financial crisis: ""How come nobody could foresee it?"" No one could answer her.""</p>
<p>Mauldin went on … ""In plain English, economists don't have a clue about the future.""</p>
<p>The real danger is that it was the ideas of some of those clueless economists that caused the financial crash and which is retarding the prosperity of the world. And they believe that the solution to the current problem is to do more of what was done to cause the problem in the first place. Politicians have economic advisors; they do not pluck economic ideas from thin air. It was the bad advice from economists that has brought us to where we are today.</p>
<p>       I humbly submit that you will stand a better chance with a Personal Financial Advisor who because of his God given insight and analytic abilities was able to determine that cash value life insurance was responsible for about 40% of the added prosperity in the world. (Economists are yet to realize this). And that was the reason Judeo-Christian counties tend to be more prosperous than non-oil producing Muslim countries.</p>
<p>       The solution to the economic crisis facing the world will not likely come from within the economic box. It is time to look outside the box. You can start with my ideas. Your valuable contributions will bring these ideas to light. With your help, I intend to take my message to the four corners of the earth and when the ideas contained in my book start transforming lives you will be pleased and proud that you helped to make it happen.</p>

<h3 align=""center"">PREFACE</h3>
<p>The financial crisis which descended on the world in August 2007 and which is continuing as we enter 2013 is the final manifestation of how inefficiently we are using money. Base on pure economic fundamentals there is absolutely no reason why the world should be enduring this agony. We have an economy because people live and they need things to sustain their lives. If the world was suffering from the Japanese phenomenon of a declining population – which leads to economic contraction, we could understand that, but the world welcomed its 7<sup>th</sup> billion soul in October 2011. This means more demand for the goods and services the world produces.</p>
<p>If the world had genuinely ran out of some of the essential commodities needed for economic activities then one could understand the ensuing contraction. If climate changes had caused severe drought resulting in a depletion of water resources this could have caused water dependent industries to cut back. The juice and beverage industry would have had to cut back. And a number of other industries that rely on water (and which one does not) would have been severely impacted. This would have caused layoffs and a decline in income which could have resulted in economic contraction. If climate changes had caused prolonged drought leading to crop failure, famine and food rationing, then one could understand the dislocation that that would have caused.</p>
<p>If any other high used commodity such as steel, aluminium, copper or lumber was in short supply forcing the economy to slow to the pace of the available supply of that commodity then we could understand the crushing compression of the economies around the world. And if the oil and gas wells had run dry and alternative sources of energy was lagging in filling the void then we could all understand the dislocation that would have occurred. But this is not the case - even when we factor in the contrived shortage of oil. It was argued that a contributing factor to the stagflation years which started in 1972 was the poor harvest of Peruvian Anchovies in that year followed by an even poorer one in 1973. Anchovies are processed into oil which is used as an additive in animal feed. The commodities essential to the smooth functioning of the global economy, while they may have supply fluctuation is nowhere near short enough to cause the severe and persistent disruption that has occurred in the economy since 2007.</p>

Hello, my name is Dorlan Francis. I am a Personal Financial Advisor. I am the holder of the Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) and the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designations. I also hold the Canadian Securities Course Certificate (CSc.) I have been in the Personal Financial Advising business since 1981.
I am the author of a previous book, LIFE INSURANCE: The Cause of Economic Prosperity. This was self-publish through Xlibris.com. It contained compelling financial and economic information. And it brought to light discoveries that where heretofore undetected. As Randal Whittle said, when he commented about the book on Amazon.com, ""5 out of 5 stars. Fascinating and Enlightening—more people should understand what it contains. ..."" It is a book with excellent ideas but it is not reaching the people who should have it because of marketing challenges due to funding constraints.
I have since written another book: The Economic and Financial Crisis (2007 - Present) How We Got In: How We Get Out. This book is more mind boggling. It contains earth shattering information. It shows how cunning men who past themselves off as wise, are pretending to give people what they want as they exploit people for their own benefit and in the process is causing global financial mayhem. This is causing the average individual to become poorer as a handful of people amass wealth out of all proportions to the effort they contribute to society.
This book is hard hitting. It name names. It shows up people who think their ideas are brilliant but are instead sowing destruction around the globe. No established publisher is going to touch it. Apart from the fact that I call names and will insist that names be called, most of the publishing houses are run by the same clique of people who are plundering and pillaging from the many for the benefit of a few. They are not likely to support a book that will rock the boat. In any event they are only interested in publishing people with name recognition. Even though often times what these recognised individuals say is harmful. They are more interested in making profits than to educate and inform; and in bringing new thinking to light. I am not encouraged by self-publishing as currently practised. I am not pleased with the outcome of my first work. If I have to pay for all marketing and promotion then I might as well maintain total control over production and distribution. This is what I intend to do but I need your help.
Your valuable contributions will be used to do the following:
Editing  ......................................... $2,500.00 - $3,000.00
Typesetting & Graphic Design .......... $2,500.00 - $3,000.00
Book Printing & Distribution ….........… $15,000.00 - $20,000
(the quantity of books print at a time will vary depending on the availability of funds. The greater the quantity the lower the unit cost per book)
Marketing and Promotion .......................... $5,000.00
The $30,000 target is to do 5,000 Hardcover Copies of the book in the first run. If there is a short fall in funding then I will do a lesser amount of copies (minimum 1000). If the goal is exceeded then I will do more copies of the book and embark on a more aggressive marketing campaign.
 Your contributions will help to change the world. You will be among the first to know about ideas that the rest of the world will sooner or later accept as orthodox truths. You will know why life has gotten so hard; why the income of the average individual keeps falling while the income of a few keeps rising. You will find out for the first time at last what caused the great depression and how the very same ideas caused a repeat in 2007. You will know why youngsters leaving universities with their first and second degrees have to be doing menial jobs to survive. You will be armed with the knowledge with which to lobby your political representatives to get them to effect change so that the future for your children and children's children will indeed be better than the past.
       You might be asking yourself: What can a personal financial advisor know about economics? And I would hasten to ask: What do economists know about economics? Studies have shown that economists are unable to predict economic out comes 99% of the times. John Mauldin wrote an article in the Newsletter: Thoughts From The Frontline with the caption: Economists Are (Still) Clueless. In that article he stated the following:
        ""In November of 2008, as stock markets crashed around the world, the Queen of England visited the London School of Economics to open the New Academic Building. While she was there, she listened in on academic lectures. The Queen, who studiously avoids controversy and almost never lets people know what she's actually thinking, finally asked a simple question about the financial crisis: ""How come nobody could foresee it?"" No one could answer her.""
Mauldin went on … ""In plain English, economists don't have a clue about the future.""
The real danger is that it was the ideas of some of those clueless economists that caused the financial crash and which is retarding the prosperity of the world. And they believe that the solution to the current problem is to do more of what was done to cause the problem in the first place. Politicians have economic advisors; they do not pluck economic ideas from thin air. It was the bad advice from economists that has brought us to where we are today.
       I humbly submit that you will stand a better chance with a Personal Financial Advisor who because of his God given insight and analytic abilities was able to determine that cash value life insurance was responsible for about 40% of the added prosperity in the world. (Economists are yet to realize this). And that was the reason Judeo-Christian counties tend to be more prosperous than non-oil producing Muslim countries.
       The solution to the economic crisis facing the world will not likely come from within the economic box. It is time to look outside the box. You can start with my ideas. Your valuable contributions will bring these ideas to light. With your help, I intend to take my message to the four corners of the earth and when the ideas contained in my book start transforming lives you will be pleased and proud that you helped to make it happen.

PREFACE
The financial crisis which descended on the world in August 2007 and which is continuing as we enter 2013 is the final manifestation of how inefficiently we are using money. Base on pure economic fundamentals there is absolutely no reason why the world should be enduring this agony. We have an economy because people live and they need things to sustain their lives. If the world was suffering from the Japanese phenomenon of a declining population – which leads to economic contraction, we could understand that, but the world welcomed its 7th billion soul in October 2011. This means more demand for the goods and services the world produces.
If the world had genuinely ran out of some of the essential commodities needed for economic activities then one could understand the ensuing contraction. If climate changes had caused severe drought resulting in a depletion of water resources this could have caused water dependent industries to cut back. The juice and beverage industry would have had to cut back. And a number of other industries that rely on water (and which one does not) would have been severely impacted. This would have caused layoffs and a decline in income which could have resulted in economic contraction. If climate changes had caused prolonged drought leading to crop failure, famine and food rationing, then one could understand the dislocation that that would have caused.
If any other high used commodity such as steel, aluminium, copper or lumber was in short supply forcing the economy to slow to the pace of the available supply of that commodity then we could understand the crushing compression of the economies around the world. And if the oil and gas wells had run dry and alternative sources of energy was lagging in filling the void then we could all understand the dislocation that would have occurred. But this is not the case - even when we factor in the contrived shortage of oil. It was argued that a contributing factor to the stagflation years which started in 1972 was the poor harvest of Peruvian Anchovies in that year followed by an even poorer one in 1973. Anchovies are processed into oil which is used as an additive in animal feed. The commodities essential to the smooth functioning of the global economy, while they may have supply fluctuation is nowhere near short enough to cause the severe and persistent disruption that has occurred in the economy since 2007.
The world has been plunged into a financial and economic crisis because of the quixotic misuse of money. And the blame must be squarely laid at the feet of the financial institutions of the world, and the misguided individuals who believe that the making of money is the ultimate goal of life. And at the feet of politicians who out of ignorance or duplicity allows the idiotic practice to thrive and prosper. The ultimate goal of life is to live! People organize themselves to find ways to sustain their lives. This is why we have an economy. If when we were born we were given a jab on our butts that would cause us not to want water, food, shelter, clothing, medicine and entertainment there would not have been an economy.  Contrary to popular belief the economy does not exist so that people make money. The economy exists because people need to live!
I have decided to write this book because I am not comforted by the response from economists or the financial analysts of the world to the greatest financial crisis since the great depression. And had it not been for the application of lessons learnt from the prior great depression this could easily have been the greatest depression the world has known. The greatest financial crisis since the great depression did not occur because of irrational exuberance or a financial market correction. The global crisis occurred because of deep seated structural and systemic flaws in our economic and financial thinking.  If a proper diagnosis is not done and fundamental changes made, then we can all brace for periodic financial shocks as we transform from a state of prosperity to a more perilous state.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Teresa Carey. I am an artist and writer with a background in journalism who has made the bold move of starting her own magazine.</p>
<p>A lot of people like it. It has even been nominated for ""Best New Magazine"" in the 31st annual Western Magazine Awards. </p>
<p>With changes the newspaper industry has seen in recent years, I decided I wanted to pursue a different path, hence the magazine. In my work as a journalist, I came to know of so many interesting stories that ""just needed to be told"". I wanted to tell these stories as well as promote a positive, life-affirming vision of Manitoba's Interlake region that would include all of its peoples.</p>
<p><strong><em>Interlake Arts, Life &amp; Leisure Magazine</em></strong> was launched in May, 2012. It is now entering its second year of publication. It is part arts and culture, part history, and part tourism magazine, written with a general audience in mind.</p>
<p>Its purpose is to tell rich in human interest stories about Manitoba's Interlake people and places--to tell them in a way that everyday people can relate to, as well as to inspire tourists and locals alike to explore the vast and varied Interlake region.</p>
<p>One of the main mandates of this magazine is to foster an appreciation of culture and arts, and shine a light on the many talented people in the region. Therefore, each issue contains at least one artist profile (often more), as well as selections of poetry and prose by a number of exceptional Interlake writers.</p>
<p>I feel it is important to weave the arts into a larger format because, the reality is, the average person does not self-identify as being  ""artsy"". Some will even put up blinders to the whole arts scene unless the stories can be told in such a way as to invite them in.</p>
<p>My background as, both, an artist and a reporter ""on the street"" has given me an interesting set of tools to pursue this vision.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Will Get</h3>
<p>It is really challenging to start up a magazine. What I need most of all at this point is to build my subscribers base significantly. This will ensure that advertisers place ads, the revenue of which covers printing and distribution costs.</p>
<p>What you will receive are 3 hard copies per year of Interlake Arts, Life &amp; Leisure Magazine.</p>
<p>Your first subscription will be at the regular price. ($21.15 per year) Your renewals will be at 25% off for as long as you wish to continue receiving the magazine. (I will be setting up a special coupon code specifically for anyone helping me with this project).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I am able to prove that I have sold (not just gave away) a minumum of 5,000 magazines in a year I will meet the threshold needed for me to apply for government grants. The grants are badly needed so that I may grow this magazine. I need to hire people to sell subscriptions and advertising. With this grant money, I will be able to do more advertising, plus I will be able to take more training to improve my design skills.</p>
<p>Without this grant money, I will hobble along. Maybe people will subscribe, but maybe not. Most of the people (95%) who have subscribed in year one did renew, so that is very hopeful. But at the current rate I am going on my own, I will not be able to meet my target.</p>
<p>If I cannot get my numbers up the advertisers who have put their trust in me based on my reputation as a journalist, may very well spend their advertising dollars elsewhere. It is a bit of a Catch 22. Besides, I have worked long hours on this with minimal pay.</p>
<p>O<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">ther Ways You Can Help:</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your help in spreading the word is also very much appreciated. While this magazine focusses on the Interlake region of Manitoba, the stories themselves are universal. Maybe you have a friend or loved one who would enjoy this magazine.</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute to this campaign, please enter a minumum of $21.15 CAD. You can also contribute $36.00 for a 2 year subscription or $47.65 for a 3 year subscription. </p>

<p>Suicide - A topic most people would rather not talk about. However, the fact is 90% of all Americans have thought about it at one point in their life. With today's hectic world, i.e. bombings, shootings, the financial crisis, the divorce rate, and the ever increasing need for society as a whole to try and ""out do"" each other, suicide is on the rise; particularly among children and the men and women in the armed forces. These are very disturbing statistics.</p>
<p>This is a personal look at my attempt at suicide, and what brought me to that point. I explain how I hide behind my life as a comedian to mask the demons in my head that lead me to the brink of suicide. But more importantly, this book is an observation of what I could have done differently to have never considered the thought in the first place. In this book I explore what triggers the notion of suicide and what you can do to make it subside. I will examine how someone who appears to have it all can place them self in a situation that they think is impossible to get out of. When the Humor is Gone offers my opinion on the topic and shares what leading psychologist have to say about the subject. I am very candid about my past, my personal thoughts, about life and my strong belief that there is always something worth living for.</p>
<p>As a self evaluation of my life, this book was not easy for me to write. However, I feel what I have written needed to be said. I offer an honest look at what brings us to the breaking point, and then how we can overcome any situation.</p>
<p>When the Humor is Gone is a sincere attempt at helping others understand and gain control over their downward spiral by examining what put me there and how I overcame it. I share other peoples idea and notions about the subject, and how it is important to recognize the signs of depression before one reaches the thought of suicide.</p>
<p>Society needs to stop ignoring their fellow man; to stop being selfish and realize every being on this planet has worth. We need to show more concern for each other and value the reason we are here. We need to encourage all we meet in our lives to reach their full potential, regardless of their social - economical background. Together, we need to eliminate suicide as an alternative to life. This is what When the Humor is Gone is all about.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>RISKS AND CHALLENGES </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a comedian in a show on the Las Vegas Strip, I realize potential guest of the show may view me in a different light once they read my book; but I am prepared to face that challenge. I am fortunate to have other income should there be a negative impact on my career as a comedian. However, I am confident enough to believe that won't happen. Whatever the outcome, helping just one person change their mind about committing suicide will make it all worthwhile.</p>
<p>The funding of this project will help publish and promote this work. I already have requests on my social media websites for this book once it is published.</p>

<p>The team’s prayer is not for safe or easy work – but the opportunity to truly make an eternal impact, the willingness to be used by God beyond their own strength/comfort, and to represent Christ’s love. Nan, Josh and Mike all possess various business, creative and pastoral backgrounds. In planning ahead with their friends already there, the team hopes to deliver God-given insight and encouragement to the brothers and sisters making a difference for the Kingdom there.</p>

In addition, the team will visit Orphanage Emmanuel out in Guaimaca, which cares for more than 600 kids who are victims of drug and human trafficking and other crimes.

As the President and Co-Founder of Freedom’s Breath, Jes has devoted her life to empowering survivors, breaking the cycles of abuse and creating a survivor informed movement that stops trafficking. Her vibrant personality and authentic approach, inspire others to live beyond their fears and circumstances, embracing the joy of life.</p>
<p>Jes is a highly sought after speaker at universities, churches and events across the country. As a dynamic keynote and trainer, her insight and experience transform the hearts of her audience, creating an unforgettable occasion.

<h3>We need you to stand with us as we develop the tools and training that will help break cycles of abuse and contribute to a long term solution.</h3>
<h2><span>Our goals by the end of 2013:</span></h2>
<p><span>1) The completion and publication of a book, authored by Jes Richardson, which breaks down the anti-trafficking movement and assists you in finding your role in stopping slavery in your city. It defines the key players within trafficking, peeling back the sheets, exposing the sex industry. Giving you an in depth look at slavery in the US and the abolitionist movement from a survivor’s perspective.  </span></p>
<p><span>2) We are developing a training curriculum to equip individuals and organizations that provides a “</span><span>Survivor Support Community</span><span>” which will help create a network of integrated resources, specifically designed for those working in direct services with trafficking survivors. </span></p>
<p><span>The philosophies of Freedom’s Breath feed the core needs of survivors and give them the tools to be empowered and restored. The continued research and development for the creation of of these critical training and culture shifting resources will assist us in further equipping a safe community of survivor informed abolitionists as well as furthering our ability to promote healing in additional survivors.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>To make this happen, Freedom’s Breath needs your help!</strong> Please consider making a generous contribution to the creation of these resources which will directly impact those, within your community, who have been commercially sexually exploited. <strong>Our goal during this campaign is to raise $20,000 by January 31st. </strong></span></p>

It defines the key players within trafficking, peeling back the sheets, exposing the sex industry. Giving you an in depth look at slavery in the US and the abolitionist movement from a survivor’s perspective.  
2) We are developing a training curriculum to equip individuals and organizations that provides a “Survivor Support Community” which will help create a network of integrated resources, specifically designed for those working in direct services with trafficking survivors. 
The philosophies of Freedom’s Breath feed the core needs of survivors and give them the tools to be empowered and restored. The continued research and development for the creation of of these critical training and culture shifting resources will assist us in further equipping a safe community of survivor informed abolitionists as well as furthering our ability to promote healing in additional survivors.
To make this happen, Freedom’s Breath needs your help! Please consider making a generous contribution to the creation of these resources which will directly impact those, within your community, who have been commercially sexually exploited. Our goal during this campaign is to raise $20,000 by January 31st.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","In recognition of the legacy of Shirley Jackson’s writing, and with permission of the author’s estate, the Shirley Jackson Awards were established in 2008 for outstanding achievement in the literature of psychological suspense, horror, and the dark fantastic. 


Shirley Jackson (1916-1965) wrote such classic novels as The Haunting of Hill House and We Have Always Lived in the Castle, as well as one of the most famous short stories in the English language, ""The Lottery."" Her work continues to be a major influence on writers of every kind of fiction, from the most traditional genre offerings to the most innovative literary work. National Book Critics Circle Award-winning novelist Jonathan Lethem has called Jackson “one of this century’s most luminous and strange American writers,” and multiple generations of authors would agree.


The Shirley Jackson Awards were founded by a group of writers who felt that the time was right for a peer-juried award that wold recognize the variety and vitality of contemporary psychological suspense, horror, and dark fantasy fiction.

For this fundraising effort, our goal is $800. Six hundred of that will go toward funding the award itself for the next year, and the remaining two hundred will go towards the cost of our incorporation. Of course we would be more than happy to exceed our fundraising goal, and take another step towards insuring the award's future.

<h2><em>Artistic Suicide</em></h2>

With your help, the book was a success. I learned a lot on the way, and once again, with the help of the indiegogo community, I was able to release my second book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GI7C0QG/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Storm Without End</a>.</p><p>Storm Without End went on to become a Amazon top 20 bestseller in <i>both</i> Dark Fantasy categories for a week in December 2013, with a several-day showing in the top 100 for both Sword &amp; Sorcery and Epic Fantasy. At its peak, Storm Without End ranked at #10!</p><p>This couldn't have happened without you.</p><p>My name is RJ Blain, and in 2014, I'm going to make my novel writing career a reality. With your help, I'm going to publish <i>four</i> novels I have in the works. <i>Royal Slaves</i>, the second book of The Fall of Erelith, will release in June of 2014. <i>Storm Surge</i>, the second book of Requiem for the Rift King, will release in December of 2014. The other two novels are standalones.</p><p>My cover artist has been hired for all of my projects, as have my editors. I have been planning on paying them through my developmental editing work. I can already hear the question. Why am I here, if I do have <i>a</i> way of paying for all of these services? </p><p>In short, I was asked to by my fans. I work with Amazon's KDP Select system. It has treated me much better than Smashwords and other venues. I do <b>not</b> like branding my books with a distributor's name on my front pages, like Smashwords requires. They use an automated system to distribute the books. I've had nothing but complaints from most people who have tried to get the e-pubs from them. Their system is a nightmare to use, as a reader, and as a writer.</p><p>But, that leaves those who enjoy <b>e-pub</b> books high and dry. I don't like that. They want a way to get my books without having to go through amazon's system.</p><p>The only way I can do this and still use Amazon's KDP Select system is to do a pre-order system (or crowdsourcing campaign). So, here I am, using this as a way to help pay for my expenses, but to also give my fans a chance to get all of the formats of my e-book at a reduced price.</p><p>That's right, all of my basic e-book perks will be at a slightly reduced cost if you preorder it. (This is versus the release price, not any promotional prices I may do via the KDP Select system.)</p><p><b>Advance Copies</b></p><p>I don't feel preordering is enough. Contributors of this campaign will enjoy advance copies of the novels in their e-mail, at least several days prior to the official release.</p><p><b>The Second Factor: </b>My editorial work isn't going to bring in much more than my basic expenses to release four books. It's going to leave me in a very, very tight place financially. By taking preorders, I can invest the money my novels deserve without bankrupting my household.<br/></p><p><b>Hand-drawn Maps</b></p><p>One of the things I loved about doing indiegogo campaigns initially was being able to offer interesting perks to fans. After much thought, I am making a limited number of hand-drawn pencil sketch maps available. Each map is drawing using a light box to approximate the lines of the kingdom regions and landmasses, with embellishments added. All maps will have a unique compass rose, sea monsters, and flourishes, as well as signature and numbering.</p><p>Perk cost includes shipping fee to US / CA.

<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>We want to have at least 100 free zines available by the beginning of the new academic year. We also want to get further advertising material. If we have some money left over we'd love to have a launch night too :) This is all to make the launch and the first edition is the best it can be so people will invest in the zine in the future. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>In our archive at our university there are many zines from women's suffrage societies that existed at Royal Holloway and Bedford College and we want to revive that line of feminist history. We want to engage existing and potential feminist activists, on and off campus.</p>

I wanted something <strong>riveting and memorable!</strong><br/><br/>I knew that lots of people love reading stories. <strong>A great story can keep people talking for years.</strong> And I’d always been passionate about storytelling — I’ve been writing since I was in middle school.<br/><br/>Realizing I could maybe use my writing to do some good and make a <strong>positive impact</strong>, I explored this idea further.<br/><br/>I interviewed around ten medical scientists and 15 people with cancer, sickle cell, and heart disease. I also researched over 40 articles and journals online around the diseases I'm covering to make sure I had the right facts.<br/><br/>From there came the fun part: <strong>writing the stories!</strong> The result is what you see here today.<br/><br/>The coolest thing about reading a story is that it whisks you away into someone else’s world. That’s why it’s so easy to get caught up in a story about a brave knight from a far-away land. Stories are a great way to see what life is like for someone <strong>who’s different from you</strong>.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will <strong>be immersed in three compelling and uplifting stories</strong> — while also discovering what it’s like to be someone with cancer, sickle cell anemia, or heart disease.<br/><br/>I also hope to instill in you the same sort of <strong>passion</strong> and <strong>excitement</strong> that I have for finding different solutions that may have a great impact on these people.<br/><br/><strong>You will love this book if you:</strong><ul>
<li>Enjoy reading uplifting, high-stakes stories</li>
<li>Are looking for something fresh, new, and unexpected</li>
<li>Like learning about cool science and technology that’s relevant to real life</li>
</ul> I’m super-glad I got to write this book, and hope it turns out to be an entertaining AND transformational experience once you read it!<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - “The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow""</h2>
<p><strong>3 stories. 3 diseases. 3 lives...that are about to end.</strong><br/><br/>The book has 3 stories:<br/><br/><strong>STORY 1</strong> is about Julian Hunt.<br/><br/>Julian is scientist whose 11-year old daughter has recently been diagnosed with cancer. He wants his daughter to stay alive, but his past experience with treatments like chemotherapy drives him to look for something better. Something that’s safer and more reliable.<br/><br/>As Julian races against the clock to figure out how else to help his daughter, he learns about a technology that might be just what he’s looking for. But whether it’ll work or not is a different story.<br/><br/><strong>STORY 2</strong> is about Dwayne Freeman.<br/><br/>He's in his mid-20's, earns a stable income — and has sickle cell, a disease that overwhelms him in regular pain and the fear of an early death. Rather than fight his enemy head-on, he coaxes himself to deal with the blows.<br/><br/>When he makes a new friend who turns his life around, he struggles as he learns to go past his personal fears around the treatments and embrace that which can secure his future — before it’s taken away.<br/><br/><strong>STORY 3</strong> is about Alan Sapolsky.<br/><br/>Al is a white-collar worker who spends a good portion of his day working at the office or catching up on the newest Netflix show. After his favorite manager survives a heart attack, he tries to get him to make lasting lifestyle changes — before something worse happens.<br/><br/>But changing habits that’ve been around since childhood won’t be easy. Al knows this pretty well — he can’t get himself to change his OWN unhealthy lifestyle.</p>

<h3>Junkyard at No Town</h3>
<p>I'm a Vermonter who grew up in rural poverty - my parents divorced, my mom raised four of us on a meager sixties and seventies school teacher's salary. We lived among long-time Vermont, working class families, but both my parents came from educated, middle-class backgrounds. I was different and survived bullying by observing and adapting.</p>
<p>Though I'm an English major, I have learned to speak perfect Vermont. Now I've written a novel inhabited by amusing and amazing characters, inspired by Woodchucks (native Vermonters) I have met. I also used my musings on old property lines, abandoned homesteads in the woods, places where people used to live, to infuse an element of transcendence and extra-normal mystery into the story. </p>

<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">In our first three reading periods, we received well over four thousand submissions, from teenagers with little experience out of English class to career writers with publications in the Kenyon Review, Paris Review and the New Yorker. All of the pieces were read blindly by WTR staff so that a <span>MFA candidate would have as good a chance of being accepted as an 11th grader. Our acceptance rate throughout our history has hovered just under five percent. </span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""> We aim to publish pieces that are electric, pieces that are like a punch in the throat, a match burning against fingertips. We've featured artists including Steven Labadessa, ARINA, Erika Craig, and Amy Guidry, as well as writers including Terese Svoboda, Kyle McCord, Chad Simpson, and Todd Kaneko. We've published National Student Poets, Poet Laureates from across the United States, U.S Presidential Scholar in the Arts nominees, Guggeinheim Fellows, Pushcart Prize winners, and NY Times Best Selling Authors. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">But at the end of the day, that's not what really matters. What matters is the writing and art that we put out every couple of months, the poetry and the short stories and the paintings that hit our nerves, that ignite our minds. From our first volume, we've been absolutely dedicated with sharing gorgeous poetry, prose and artwork with the world, and we're extremely excited for our two new categories, Drama and Film.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have a volunteer staff of over 50 writers and artists, and a contributor community of over 200 incredibly talented individuals. We have been someone's first publication and someone's hundredth. We have shared such hauntingly beautiful work, honestly, the work that WTR puts out comes from really, really amazing people, and all I want is to be able to continue to find the voices, to find the pieces, that just click, that make a mark right away.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Winter Tangerine Review was initially funded by an IndieGoGo campaign, and as we've grown in the past year, those funds have been entirely depleted, and all sales we've made have gone back into the journal.  We want Winter Tangerine to continue expanding and solidifying its stance as a journal that challenges people to leave boundaries behind and give pages personalities. We need you- right now, WTR is very, very close to going entirely bankrupt. </p>

We've renamed our events ""WTR: Poetry, Art &amp; Film"", as we'll be screening the accepted films at these events as well! We plan on holding a celebratory event in NYC on March 22nd, our one year anniversary, as well as several others in the upcoming months. Readings are so important because it connects the artwork with the artist, the poet with their words.

The story follows Leslie Ratley and her family traversing a multiverse in hopes to find a new world for humanity, while the long standing ideologies of human purpose stand in the way.<br/><br/>My name is Jack Deignan and I am the author of An American Family. I wrote this book because I believe the future of our world is in the hands of empathy, and uncontrollable. This book is my call to recognize the privilege history has created for a select group of people, and manifest a world that prioritizes every life under its citizenship. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover some of your own privileges and biases you have always taken for granted, and incorporate empathy more commonly in your daily life. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the intersectionality of race and power in this country, and in this world. You'll learn alongside the Ratley family about the importance of recognizing privilege, but not using it to force your name in a conversation that should be about someone else.  <br/><br/>In the middle of the 2040s in the United States, temperatures across the country have risen to historical rates once again and many cities have become inhabitable. Meanwhile, systemic racism and implicit biases that have infected this country since its conception are still widespread, and the ever-nearing extinction of earth has forced the hand of thousands of Americans to resort to violence. President Slack and his administration sit idly by watching the world burn below them, but Leslie Ratley and her family have a chance to find a solution. President Slack approves of a mission to search for an alternate reality, although he never intends to keep his promise of seeing this mission through. With the President’s deception unbeknownst to them, the Ratley family traverses a multiverse in search of a world to save humanity and escape their dying one. Throughout the progression of their journey, Leslie has to confront a lot of her own biases and privileges in order to accomplish the mission of her lifetime. Eventually, Leslie has to make a decision between the country and her family, a decision looming from the start of the book. <br/><br/>You will love this book if you are interested in the intersectionality of race and privilege in America, advocation for a revamped policy and approach towards the threat of global warming, and the endless possibilities of alternate realities and multiverses.<br/><br/>An American Family speaks to White people and authority figures who want to grapple with privilege and responsibility in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that An American Family inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><p>How has privilege contributed to or harmed my life?</p><p>How can I recognize my privilege and use it to amplify marginalized voices?</p><p>How quickly can we re-educate the ideas and constructs of humanity before it leads to our eventual demise?</p><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing race, power, privilege, and the climate will change us all for the better. <br/><br/><strong>Themes</strong><br/><br/>The primary theme of this book is race, and how Whiteness has caused the erasure of other races in the United States. Since the conception of this country, Whiteness has been held as a standard that has led to inherent privilege for members of the race, whether they recognize it or not. Regardless of whether it is recognized, the only way to use this privilege to enhance the lives of the marginalized is to amplify their voices and struggles. This is an internal battle that Leslie Ratley will struggle with throughout the book, as her original intention in helping the less privileged is still tethered to her desire to be a good example of Whiteness. Eventually, she must learn that she must use her privilege to listen instead of act, but she will have to learn this before it is too late. <br/><br/>Another theme in my book is the idea of power, especially in the United States. Due to power being so concentrated in this country since its origin, the accountability it has today is little to none. If the power structure in the United States is not reorganized to truly represent the citizens of this country, it will eventually lead to our demise. President Slack is an example of power being unchecked in the United States, and his executive rule could lead to the deaths of millions. <br/><br/>The last theme I would like to emphasize is empathy, as I believe empathy is the root of securing a future for our humanity. From the beginning of time, there has always been this stereotype that there must be an authority in order to have a purpose, and it has clouded the beliefs about humanity in so many cultures. With so many obstacles facing our country today and we are expected to face in the future, our country must learn to teach and emphasize empathy in order to listen to as many voices as possible. If we do not come together as one human race, it will be the end of every race before we know it. <br/><br/> </p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><p>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021.</p><p>The cover design of my book.

When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p><p> </p><p>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</p><p>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</p><p>You will receive early access to the Author’s Note and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.</p><p>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.</p><p>You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</p><p>And much more!</p><p> </p><p><strong>About the Author</strong></p><p><br/>Jack Deignan is a third-year English major, Spanish, and Film minor at UCLA.

The story follows Leslie Ratley and her family traversing a multiverse in hopes to find a new world for humanity, while the long standing ideologies of human purpose stand in the way.My name is Jack Deignan and I am the author of An American Family. I wrote this book because I believe the future of our world is in the hands of empathy, and uncontrollable. This book is my call to recognize the privilege history has created for a select group of people, and manifest a world that prioritizes every life under its citizenship. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover some of your own privileges and biases you have always taken for granted, and incorporate empathy more commonly in your daily life. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the intersectionality of race and power in this country, and in this world. You'll learn alongside the Ratley family about the importance of recognizing privilege, but not using it to force your name in a conversation that should be about someone else.  In the middle of the 2040s in the United States, temperatures across the country have risen to historical rates once again and many cities have become inhabitable. Meanwhile, systemic racism and implicit biases that have infected this country since its conception are still widespread, and the ever-nearing extinction of earth has forced the hand of thousands of Americans to resort to violence. President Slack and his administration sit idly by watching the world burn below them, but Leslie Ratley and her family have a chance to find a solution. President Slack approves of a mission to search for an alternate reality, although he never intends to keep his promise of seeing this mission through. With the President’s deception unbeknownst to them, the Ratley family traverses a multiverse in search of a world to save humanity and escape their dying one. Throughout the progression of their journey, Leslie has to confront a lot of her own biases and privileges in order to accomplish the mission of her lifetime. Eventually, Leslie has to make a decision between the country and her family, a decision looming from the start of the book. You will love this book if you are interested in the intersectionality of race and privilege in America, advocation for a revamped policy and approach towards the threat of global warming, and the endless possibilities of alternate realities and multiverses.An American Family speaks to White people and authority figures who want to grapple with privilege and responsibility in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that An American Family inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:How has privilege contributed to or harmed my life?How can I recognize my privilege and use it to amplify marginalized voices?How quickly can we re-educate the ideas and constructs of humanity before it leads to our eventual demise?I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing race, power, privilege, and the climate will change us all for the better. ThemesThe primary theme of this book is race, and how Whiteness has caused the erasure of other races in the United States. Since the conception of this country, Whiteness has been held as a standard that has led to inherent privilege for members of the race, whether they recognize it or not. Regardless of whether it is recognized, the only way to use this privilege to enhance the lives of the marginalized is to amplify their voices and struggles. This is an internal battle that Leslie Ratley will struggle with throughout the book, as her original intention in helping the less privileged is still tethered to her desire to be a good example of Whiteness. Eventually, she must learn that she must use her privilege to listen instead of act, but she will have to learn this before it is too late. Another theme in my book is the idea of power, especially in the United States. Due to power being so concentrated in this country since its origin, the accountability it has today is little to none. If the power structure in the United States is not reorganized to truly represent the citizens of this country, it will eventually lead to our demise. President Slack is an example of power being unchecked in the United States, and his executive rule could lead to the deaths of millions. The last theme I would like to emphasize is empathy, as I believe empathy is the root of securing a future for our humanity. From the beginning of time, there has always been this stereotype that there must be an authority in order to have a purpose, and it has clouded the beliefs about humanity in so many cultures. With so many obstacles facing our country today and we are expected to face in the future, our country must learn to teach and emphasize empathy in order to listen to as many voices as possible. If we do not come together as one human race, it will be the end of every race before we know it.  What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>The Campaign In Brief</h3>
<p>Welcome to the campaign for <i>Galaxy Ascendant</i> books 4 &amp; 5, <i>A Fiery Reckoning I: Ascendancy’s Rise</i>, and <i>A Fiery Reckoning II: Empire’s Fall</i>!</p>
<p>I’m Yakov Merkin, author of the <i>Galaxy Ascendant</i> series, <i>The Dragon Hand</i>, and a few other things. I’m also a recovering academic and active duty soldier in the Israeli Defense Force.</p>
<p>While I’ve been blessed with the ability to write quite a bit during my service, these books being the second and third I’ve written over about a 19 month period, army salaries aren’t anything to write home about, and, as I’m doing all of this on my own, it can be a bit difficult. My aim with this campaign is to raise the funds to be able to pay my cover artist, editor, map artist, and formatters for their excellent services and bring these next two books of the <i>Galaxy Ascendant </i>series to life!</p>
<p>Now, the big question: Why try and fund two books at once? The answer in simple. These two books were originally conceived as one; however, it quickly became apparent that the story was so big it required two books to tell properly, and so we come to the two biggest books in the series so far, if not in word count than in the scope of events that take place. We follow more than eight primary characters through this war which began in <i>Galaxy Ascendant </i>book 3, <i>A Shifting Alliance</i>, and which has only further escalated.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal with my writing is to make this my full time job once I complete my army service, and one crucial stepping stone to that is being able to continue to be able to afford to get the highest quality people to work with me on this project—which will not end when the series concludes with book 7. The <i>Galaxy Ascendant </i>is here to stay.</p>
<p>That’s where you come in. By helping me cover these costs, you assure that this series, loved by its readers, can continue, and you can help ensure that in an age where so many established space opera franchises are reeling, new, fresh, and awesome stories can still be told in—in my opinion—the best speculative fiction genre out there.</p>
<h3>Some More Detail</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, I need your help to be able to pay my artists, editors, and more for top-quality work.</p>
<p>Of course, you will get things in return for your support. Perks range from a cheap as $5, which nets you ebooks of books 4 &amp; 5, up to levels that get you the entire series in ebook and print, with Galactic level reward tiers that can see you help shape this emerging universe.</p>
<p>With the Travel to the Galaxy Ascendant, A Glorious Death, and Live in the Galaxy Ascendant reward levels, you will get the opportunity to work with me to create a side character who will appear in the last two books of the series.</p>
<p>With the Ship Design reward levels, you will work with me and an artist to design ship concept art. Level 1 sees you get input into the look of ships already established in the series, while level 2 allows you to help create, from the ground up (with some limitations) designs and specs for ships mentioned but not described in detail in the series—or possibly an entirely new ship type which will appear in book 6 or 7. ;)</p>
<p>Lastly, if you truly want to make your mark on the <i>Galaxy Ascendant</i>, we have a new, mega reward tier that will see you work with me to craft a <i>Galaxy Ascendant</i> short story which will be canon to the universe, centering on a character of your choice from the series. Apart from that, you will help determine the type of story that will be written, what will happen, etc (I get some say too, of course), and then I will write the story, which will be dedicated to you in thanks for your generous support. You will of course see it before anyone else. Additionally, when I eventually (within the next year or two most likely) put together a collection of <i>Galaxy Ascendant </i>short stories, yours will be included as well.</p>
<p>If we don’t hit my goal, I will still, thanks to flexible funding, get whatever was raised. I will find a way to ensure the books come out regardless and that the series continues, but that will be much more doable with your generous assistance.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many of the great sci-fi franchises we grew up with and which inspired us are not in a good state today, whether due to poor creative decisions by those overseeing them, or through simple abandonment. The <i>Galaxy Ascendant</i> series is my contribution to an indie space opera renaissance, a vast, expansive galactic setting in which the storytelling options are endless, and in which I intend to write for a long, long time to come. And this galaxy is growing rapidly. Book 1, <i>A Greater Duty,</i> was released in May 2017, and now we’re nearly at the release of book 5. G-d willing, books 6 &amp; 7 will be out by next spring. In total, I’ve already put out four novels, including <i>A Greater Duty</i>, in that time span, along with several smaller works. And as those who backed my last camping can attest, I get the rewards out on time, and the book released promptly. I take great pride in getting my work done, on time, and getting people what they paid for. If there are any unforeseen delays, rest assured that I will be completely transparent about them.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are none for you! As I mentioned above, I pride myself on getting the work done, on time, and I am easily reachable if there are any issues (due to time delay and army stuff, it might take my a couple days to get back to you, but I always do.)</p>
<p>Obviously, there are more risks &amp; challenges here for me; I have the books to get ready and out, after all, and, as can be seen, I’ve already gotten most aspects of the project done (cover arts, maps, and book 4’s editing) done so that there will be as little as possible time between the campaign’s end and when rewards start shipping out.</p>
<p>This is why it’s all the more vital that I be able to raise the necessary funds via this campaign, so I can properly pay everyone on time. Whatever happens, I will make it work and get the books out, because this is what I do. This series is something I need to complete and share with the world. But it’d be much better, much more pleasant, if this campaign can take care of that. Success here will better enable me to put out more, awesome products in the coming year—and of do I have fun things planned!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I knew that there are plenty of people out there for whom money is tight; I’ve been there myself. However, even if you’re unable to contribute at this time, you can still greatly help this campaign by sharing it out with others online, telling people you know personally about it, or even by sharing the campaign video, which is on YouTube. Don’t underestimate just how much even a simple share, which takes barely a second or two to do, can do to help! It only takes the right person seeing the campaign to help ensure that it is a success.</p>

Many of the great sci-fi franchises we grew up with and which inspired us are not in a good state today, whether due to poor creative decisions by those overseeing them, or through simple abandonment. The Galaxy Ascendant series is my contribution to an indie space opera renaissance, a vast, expansive galactic setting in which the storytelling options are endless, and in which I intend to write for a long, long time to come. And this galaxy is growing rapidly. Book 1, A Greater Duty, was released in May 2017, and now we’re nearly at the release of book 5. G-d willing, books 6 & 7 will be out by next spring. In total, I’ve already put out four novels, including A Greater Duty, in that time span, along with several smaller works. And as those who backed my last camping can attest, I get the rewards out on time, and the book released promptly. I take great pride in getting my work done, on time, and getting people what they paid for. If there are any unforeseen delays, rest assured that I will be completely transparent about them.
Risks & Challenges
There are none for you! As I mentioned above, I pride myself on getting the work done, on time, and I am easily reachable if there are any issues (due to time delay and army stuff, it might take my a couple days to get back to you, but I always do.)
Obviously, there are more risks & challenges here for me; I have the books to get ready and out, after all, and, as can be seen, I’ve already gotten most aspects of the project done (cover arts, maps, and book 4’s editing) done so that there will be as little as possible time between the campaign’s end and when rewards start shipping out.
This is why it’s all the more vital that I be able to raise the necessary funds via this campaign, so I can properly pay everyone on time. Whatever happens, I will make it work and get the books out, because this is what I do. This series is something I need to complete and share with the world. But it’d be much better, much more pleasant, if this campaign can take care of that. Success here will better enable me to put out more, awesome products in the coming year—and of do I have fun things planned!
Other Ways You Can Help
I knew that there are plenty of people out there for whom money is tight; I’ve been there myself. However, even if you’re unable to contribute at this time, you can still greatly help this campaign by sharing it out with others online, telling people you know personally about it, or even by sharing the campaign video, which is on YouTube. Don’t underestimate just how much even a simple share, which takes barely a second or two to do, can do to help! It only takes the right person seeing the campaign to help ensure that it is a success.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

for children-at-heart) where any creation can be turned upside-down to reveal
other amazing characters and objects.
The image below is identical to the one above. It’s just turned
upside-down. 
Why is Upside-down World so amazing?Using our mathematically inspired technique that was initially developed for our books to encourage continuous reading (as the
next sections discuss), we are able to create endless fun upside-down
interactions, as illustrated by the riddle below:                                                                         * For the answer, have a look at our Gallery.  
Why do children love Upside-down World?Children, due to their natural curiosity, have an inherent need to play with objects. Children love the creations of Upside-down World, e.g. its books, since they can flip them around to explore them. This encourages reading too, as illustrated below: * Children reading the book Upside-down Brothers while sitting opposite one another. Why do parents love Upside-down World?Today, parents know that interactive play is a natural way for children to learn. The interactions of Upside-down World develop children’s imagination and creativity while encouraging reading too. They also show children the importance of looking at things from different angles and that ""there are two sides to every coin"", thus teaching them to accept another point-of-view.
What are endless books?
Each book in our series of illustrated children’s books is read
from one side to its end, then turned upside-down and read to the other side of
the book. As a result, the story continues endlessly, which young children love since they often want to hear the same story again and again. How do endless books encourage reading?Since our books are endless, children will be reading them
again and again, thereby improving their reading skills. Moreover, the interactive aspect of these upside-down books
develops thinking at an early age, further strengthening reading. Do your books have positive messages for children?Yes, they do, ranging from the importance of recycling to a family's never-ending love. For instance, our 1st book, Upside-down Brothers, emphasizes the
endless love of two brothers for each other.                                   One side of Upside-down Brothers tells the
story of a brother named Messalot, who is creating a mess in the room to make
his brother Tidyalot happier.
The other side tells the story of Tidyalot, who is tidying up
the room to make his brother Messalot happier. Here is the same page above
turned upside-down: 
What does Upside-down World include?In addition to its endless books that encourage reading, Upside-down World includes many other fun creations that can all be turned upside-down, as illustrated below: * See Gallery for more products, e.g. iPhone cases, mouse pads and greeting cards. Who created Upside-down World?It was created by Noga Friedman and Moti Friedman for
their five children and for all the other children of the world. Noga (PhD) is a
writer and artist whose works have been shown in numerous exhibitions, including
at Les Artistes Français in Paris. Moti (PhD) is also a writer and artist who

<p>Hello and thank you for clicking on my campaign! My name is Anca and I'm a writer. Above is a picture of me reading some of my poems at the Poetry Cafe in London.</p>
<p>Late last year, I published my first book in electronic format. It's called ""Hidden Animals"", it contains poems and short stories and I like to describe it as a fantasy concept book. Mythology is my main inspiration and I have a fascination with symbols, which is why in this book I use images of fantastical creatures as metaphors for emotions hidden deeply inside the human heart - and that's the concept! Then, inspired by the tradition of Medieval Bestiaries (as well as the modern Bestiary that is J.L. Borges' ""Book of Imaginary Beings""), I organised these stories and poems into three parts - Birds, Beasts and Spirits - to suggest a spiritual progression and create a sort of Bestiary of the human soul. (So, in case you're wondering about the weird perk names, they correspond to the three parts of the book!)<br/></p>
<p>Here is the book blurb:</p>
<p><i>""In this collection of 
poems and short stories, fantastical creatures stand for all that is 
deeply hidden inside the human heart. Birds of all kinds live together 
mysteriously inside a country manor, a nobleman’s careless life is 
disturbed by an unexpected intruder, a monk travels a dying world in 
search of a god of chaos, and being the ruler of a fairy court is not 
all it’s made out to be. The Birds, symbolising hope, faith and 
sometimes fatality, the Beasts that, in their various forms, embody the 
allure of danger and of all that is primal, and the Spirits, which have 
their subtle ways of influencing all action, come together into one 
Hidden Animal, which is nothing but the part of human nature that always
 remains mysterious and unexplained.""</i><br/></p>

</div></div>","The Story

My name is Christopher Bernard, and I believe storytelling changes lives.  Iâ€™d like to inspire you with my newest project, entitled â€˜Rainâ€™ that will help end the literary drought brought on by the change in the publishing industry.
Set in a distant galaxy, the story is about a young farmer named Rain who becomes a warrior fighting for freedom against an ingenious nation seeking absolute sovereignty.  When the story begins, we learn that Rain struggles to control his temper and the haunting memories of losing his twin brother to the ruling nation.  When he discovers the arrival of a mysterious stranger named Kimmo, Rain believes heâ€™ll be able to find some answers.  However, Rain soon discovers Kimmo isnâ€™t the man he appeared to be when they are forced to escape to the nation of Guhdar. 
The Impact
Supporting this project not only gives you control on the future of the publishing industry, it also brings a new voice to young readers. 


The Goal
I want nothing more than to take readers on a fantastic emotional and visual journey through Rainâ€™s world.  The graphic novel will present the first part of the story told in four issues. The artwork, showcases the talents of Jason Pedersen, who will bring the first three chapters of the novel to life.  Jason Pedersen has been  helping other starving artists achieve their dreams.  He is an artist from Arizona who has agreed to help me bring my story to life, so I would like to return the favor and pay him what he is worth.  Jason is also a very talented tattoo artist! Visit Jasonâ€™s webpage by clicking here.

After the completion of the young adult novel, I wanted to continue adapting the story to make it more accessible to everyone, and if I hope to realize this dream, I'm going to need major support.  I am asking backers to help with the costs to illustrate the graphic novel, and purchase a high quality cover for the book. Here's a breakdown of the costs I face as an emerging author:

â€¢ $215 per page ($110 for pencils, $80 for colors, and $25 for lettering) x 50 pages = $10,750
â€¢ $1500 for high quality artwork for the paperback/hardcover book.
â€¢ $0 for the writer whoâ€™s payment will be knowing you love the story!  Remember to starve the artist, not the dream!
I hope to raise enough funds to complete the first stage of the 50 page graphic novel.  The money raised will go towards the actual total of $14,550.00 to produce all the art and hopefully there will be some left over for production costs.  Why so much? There are administration fees for publishing, and promotional items to be generated and paid for, printing, and distribution, and a certain amount of advertising costs, not to mention the fees taken by IndieGoGo, and credit card companies.
This campaign is all or nothing, so reaching the goal is paramount! As if supporting a young writerâ€™s dream isnâ€™t reward enough [in most cases, itâ€™s not], supporters can choose from a plethora of awesome rewards! * International Supporters, please add $10 for shipping and handling charges.


Other Ways You Can Help
This project has been a labor of love for the past two years, and now I feel it's ready to be shared with you.  In order for this project to be successful, I need your support to reach 100%!  Every dollar counts, and is greatly appreciated.  With gratitude, I ask that you pass the link to this page and our website to your friends and ask them to do the same.  Everyoneâ€™s got a few friends who can tell a few friends!  Let me know what you think about the artwork and the campaign, and to see more images, visit: thenationofrain.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Qué es Yanuq?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Yanuq.com
es el Portal No 1 de cocina peruana en el mundo. Fue creado hace 15 años y
cuenta con más de 4.000 recetas! Y lo mejor, es completamente gratuito!</p>
<p>Yanuq
fue creado en Lima por 3 amigas que quisieron compartir sus recetas -y las de
sus familias- con el resto del mundo. Las recetas son todas probadas y
comprobadas hasta el último detalle así que son casi infalibles! Yanuq comenzó
con 350 recetas y no ha parado de crecer. Muchas recetas son aportes de los
propios miembros de la comunidad.</p>
<p>Alrededor
de Yanuq (que significa cocinero en quechua) se reúnen cientos de miles de
amantes y curiosos de la cocina peruana, para celebrar su pasión por ella y
compartir sus conocimientos.  </p>
<p>Ahora,
a pedido de los miembros de su comunidad, <b>Yanuq quiere renovar su plataforma tecnológica para facilitar
a sus usuarios la consulta de sus recetas favoritas en tablets y celulares.</b></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Lo que necesitamos </h3> <p></p>
<p>Yanuq
necesita una ayuda de todos sus amigos y seguidores para lograr una
renovación de imagen y de tecnología que permita a todos seguir disfrutando de
estas infalibles recetas en todos los soportes. Principalmente en tablets y
celulares.</p>
<p>Para
lograr este proyecto Yanuq necesita <b>USD 10.000</b>, que se usarán para contratar
100 horas de programación, servicios de diseño y creación de imágenes.</p>
<p>Para
compensar a todos los que nos ayuden, ofrecemos en recompensa e-books de Yanuq,
así como menciones en la sección de Benefactores del portal.</p>
<p>Los
fondos que se consigan se destinarán específicamente para este proyecto. En
caso no se consiga la meta, los fondos serán complementados con recursos
propios.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>La campaña</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Durante
45 días haremos una campaña para solicitar la ayuda de todos los usuarios del
portal. Es nuestra primera experiencia de crowd funding y estamos muy
entusiasmados. También es una oportunidad para medir la confianza y compromiso
de los más de 500.000 usuarios que conforman la comunidad de Yanuq y utilizan
nuestros servicios mes a mes.</p>

Qué es Yanuq? 
Yanuq.com
es el Portal No 1 de cocina peruana en el mundo. Fue creado hace 15 años y
cuenta con más de 4.000 recetas! Y lo mejor, es completamente gratuito!
Yanuq
fue creado en Lima por 3 amigas que quisieron compartir sus recetas -y las de
sus familias- con el resto del mundo. Las recetas son todas probadas y
comprobadas hasta el último detalle así que son casi infalibles! Yanuq comenzó
con 350 recetas y no ha parado de crecer. Muchas recetas son aportes de los
propios miembros de la comunidad.
Alrededor
de Yanuq (que significa cocinero en quechua) se reúnen cientos de miles de
amantes y curiosos de la cocina peruana, para celebrar su pasión por ella y
compartir sus conocimientos.  
Ahora,
a pedido de los miembros de su comunidad, Yanuq quiere renovar su plataforma tecnológica para facilitar
a sus usuarios la consulta de sus recetas favoritas en tablets y celulares.
   Lo que necesitamos  
Yanuq
necesita una ayuda de todos sus amigos y seguidores para lograr una
renovación de imagen y de tecnología que permita a todos seguir disfrutando de
estas infalibles recetas en todos los soportes. Principalmente en tablets y
celulares.
Para
lograr este proyecto Yanuq necesita USD 10.000, que se usarán para contratar
100 horas de programación, servicios de diseño y creación de imágenes.
Para
compensar a todos los que nos ayuden, ofrecemos en recompensa e-books de Yanuq,
así como menciones en la sección de Benefactores del portal.
Los
fondos que se consigan se destinarán específicamente para este proyecto. En
caso no se consiga la meta, los fondos serán complementados con recursos
propios.
   La campaña 

Durante
45 días haremos una campaña para solicitar la ayuda de todos los usuarios del
portal. Es nuestra primera experiencia de crowd funding y estamos muy
entusiasmados. También es una oportunidad para medir la confianza y compromiso
de los más de 500.000 usuarios que conforman la comunidad de Yanuq y utilizan
nuestros servicios mes a mes.

  Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar  

Otras
formas de ayudar al lanzamiento de la nueva versión para celular y tablet de
Yanuq es difundir esta campaña entre tus familiares y amigos. Además, también

<h2>Who is behind <i>Mynah</i>? </h2>
</div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The <i>Mynah</i> team consists of three editors (Ruby, Karen and Isabelle), a creative director (Brian), and our moneyman (Bill). We are not working on <i>Mynah</i> for profit. We are also collectively indebted to Google Docs and Telegram.</span></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h2>Why <i>Mynah</i>? </h2>
<p></p>
<p><i>Mynah</i> began because we saw a gap in Singapore’s publishing landscape where  in-depth Singapore stories should’ve been – the kind that look into aspects of the country that fall by the wayside. We wanted to carve out a space where stories could plumb the depths of understanding Singapore and thrive in exploring the timbres and textures of our country the mainstream media does not cover. We also wanted <i>Mynah</i> to be a space for the architects of these stories – writers, illustrators, photographers and more – to be in conversation with each other.</p>
<p>We’re also print magazine enthusiasts, as quaint as that might sound. Having all of these stories in a physical magazine we could hold and keep was an obvious choice for us. In this issue of <i>Mynah</i>, you can expect 20 well-researched and diverse stories packed into a 132-page magazine. With the 24/7 news cycle going at lightning speed, we wanted to create a slow reading experience, a magazine you can sit with and keep coming back to again and again.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470690817/d_fsotjh.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 548.545px;height: 431px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Where does the money go?</h2>
<p>The money you pledge firstly goes toward printing the magazine itself and delivering it into your hands. As lovers of the print medium, we prioritise quality. Paper, ink, binding – you name it, we’re aiming for the best. All magazines ordered through Indiegogo are significantly discounted from their usual retail price, so we encourage you to get a copy sooner rather than later! We're committed to getting all pre-ordered copies printed and delivered to you, regardless of whether we meet our funding goal. </p>The moolah also goes to our contributors, whom we have been paying out of our own pockets thus far. When we started <i>Mynah</i>, we knew that paying our contributors was going to be one of the most important aspects of the magazine. We value original, creative work, and paying creators is the first step to making sure that their work continues to exist. Because we’re a new, so far self-funded magazine, we haven’t been able to wholly accomplish this: many of our contributors graciously declined payment for their work. Any additional funds from this crowdfunding campaign will go towards honorariums for these creatives who believed in us enough to work for free.<p></p>

<h2>What perks do you offer?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Besides copies of the magazine at a discounted pre-order price, we've got some exciting stuff available that we can't wait to share with you. For one, we've got postcard-sized prints of our very own Mynah Visual Mixtapes. We asked three incredible local artists – <a href=""http://www.tycstudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TELL YOUR CHILDREN</a>, <a href=""https://www.behance.net/kennlam"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kenn Lam</a> and <a href=""http://www.aeropalmics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aeropalmics</a> – to curate five-song playlists to the theme of “Firsts” and illustrate them, with thrilling outcomes.

<p>And we've got three volumes of poetry whose authors appear in the pages of <i>Mynah</i> #1: <i>Sonnets From the Singlish</i> by Joshua Ip, <i>Love is an Empty Barstool</i> by Pooja Nansi and <i>A History of Clocks</i> by Jennifer Anne Champion. Limited quantities available!</p>

In Mynah #1 you’ll find work by emerging writers we’re excited about – Sharanya Pillai, Marie Ee, Daniel Soo and more – and by established contributors we’re honoured to work with – Yu-Mei Balasingamchow, Joshua Ip and Robert Zhao, just to name a few!


Who is behind Mynah? 

The Mynah team consists of three editors (Ruby, Karen and Isabelle), a creative director (Brian), and our moneyman (Bill). We are not working on Mynah for profit. We are also collectively indebted to Google Docs and Telegram.
   
Why Mynah? 

Mynah began because we saw a gap in Singapore’s publishing landscape where  in-depth Singapore stories should’ve been – the kind that look into aspects of the country that fall by the wayside. We wanted to carve out a space where stories could plumb the depths of understanding Singapore and thrive in exploring the timbres and textures of our country the mainstream media does not cover. We also wanted Mynah to be a space for the architects of these stories – writers, illustrators, photographers and more – to be in conversation with each other.
We’re also print magazine enthusiasts, as quaint as that might sound. Having all of these stories in a physical magazine we could hold and keep was an obvious choice for us. In this issue of Mynah, you can expect 20 well-researched and diverse stories packed into a 132-page magazine. With the 24/7 news cycle going at lightning speed, we wanted to create a slow reading experience, a magazine you can sit with and keep coming back to again and again.




Where does the money go?
The money you pledge firstly goes toward printing the magazine itself and delivering it into your hands. As lovers of the print medium, we prioritise quality. Paper, ink, binding – you name it, we’re aiming for the best. All magazines ordered through Indiegogo are significantly discounted from their usual retail price, so we encourage you to get a copy sooner rather than later! We're committed to getting all pre-ordered copies printed and delivered to you, regardless of whether we meet our funding goal. The moolah also goes to our contributors, whom we have been paying out of our own pockets thus far. When we started Mynah, we knew that paying our contributors was going to be one of the most important aspects of the magazine. We value original, creative work, and paying creators is the first step to making sure that their work continues to exist. Because we’re a new, so far self-funded magazine, we haven’t been able to wholly accomplish this: many of our contributors graciously declined payment for their work. Any additional funds from this crowdfunding campaign will go towards honorariums for these creatives who believed in us enough to work for free.



What perks do you offer?

Besides copies of the magazine at a discounted pre-order price, we've got some exciting stuff available that we can't wait to share with you. For one, we've got postcard-sized prints of our very own Mynah Visual Mixtapes. We asked three incredible local artists – TELL YOUR CHILDREN, Kenn Lam and Aeropalmics – to curate five-song playlists to the theme of “Firsts” and illustrate them, with thrilling outcomes. You’ll get to choose your favourite design!



We've also got postcard-sized prints of analogue photos of the beloved Rochor Centre, made by Amanda Sarah Chin. Choose your favourite.




And we've got three volumes of poetry whose authors appear in the pages of Mynah #1: Sonnets From the Singlish by Joshua Ip, Love is an Empty Barstool by Pooja Nansi and A History of Clocks by Jennifer Anne Champion. Limited quantities available!


As we go to print in September, we hope to ship all magazines and perks out in November. Shipping will take a week for Singapore addresses and up to 10 weeks for locations elsewhere in the world.
How else can I help?
If what we've said strikes a chord with you and you'd like to help out beyond just purchasing copies of the magazine, here are some ways you can do so: 

If you're a stockist, distributor or bookstore owner who's interested in stocking Mynah, reach out to us at info@mynahmag.com 

If you're an educator, programme director or would like to make mass purchases for your school, company or organisation, let us know at info@mynahmag.com 
If you like what you see and would like to talk about potentially sponsoring future issues of Mynah, again, info@mynahmag.com is the place to go!
Know someone who'd love our magazine? Spread the word by sharing our crowdfunding campaign on social media and telling all your friends!",8.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<li>Creating a <b>Legacy </b>of outstandingly beautiful, long-lasting resources to pass on beneficial knowledge that teaches children about the importance of faith and the rich, valuable lessons from the stories in the Quran.</li>
<li>Creating <b>Exceptional </b>and inspirational designs of the highest quality in the material we publish.</li>
<li>Making our published materials <b>Accessible </b>to all children, from all backgrounds and faiths to enjoy. This is highlighted particularly through our commitment with our Charity Partner READ Foundation who champion education for all.  </li>
<li>Igniting a curiosity in all children to <b>Discover </b>the profound and exciting and moral stories in the Qur’an. For Muslim children, we hope it will inspire the discovery into the beauty of the Arabic language to understand the depth of these stories further.</li>
<li>Creating innovative <b>Educational</b> resources to make learning about Islam truly inspiring and fun for all.</li>
<li>Developing a deeper sense of <b>Respect</b> and tolerance in children from an early age towards other faiths and beliefs, bridging gaps and highlighting the similarities in the stories of the Old Testament to the Quranic stories in particular – something which will develop further as our series progresses.</li>
<li>Developing a child’s <b>Spiritual </b>needs and interests as they grow older, cultivating an awareness of their Creator and creating a bond with Him through fond memories of reading these sensational stories.</li>

A VERY SPECIAL THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO KINDLY SUPPORTED OUR CAMPAIGN AND HELPED US BRING OUR DREAM TO MAKE STORIES FROM THE QURAN COME TO LIFE IN POP-UP & 3D! 
WE'RE BUSY GETTING THE PRODUCTION STARTED TO BRING YOU ALL YOUR LOVELY POP-UP BOOKS & REWARDS IN TIME FOR EID IN JULY 2014

Pop-up Book includes quiz, colouring play mat and press-out activity                       The perfect gift for children you love.
In 570 A.D. Yemen, the tyrant ruler Abraha leads his army of elephants to destroy God’s House, the Ka’ba in the Holy city of Makkah. Armed with only prayers, the Arabs rely on their faith and trust in God to save the Ka’ba and discover some unexpected miracles along the way!
About our Founder and AuthorSalaam / Hello, I'm Hajera, the founder of Shade 7; a new publisher of high quality Pop-up Quranic educational story books & interactive digital 3D apps that help children learn about Islam in a fun way.I trained and qualified as a banking lawyer in the heart of London. In the summer of 2012, I decided to quit my job and spend my life doing something I was extremely passionate about. I knew I wanted to explore my creative side! I had a good think about all the things I’d like to do in my life and thought, if I could do ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, what would it be?Who could I become that would bring the most benefit to the world as a Muslim woman? I really wanted establish something which would allow me to leave a legacy behind.Some key things came to mind:
On-going beneficial knowledge;
‘Sadaqah jariyah’ (ceaseless charity); and 
The hadith, or Prophetic saying that “Seven types of people will be shaded by God under His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His.”

Putting knowledge into actionI wanted to turn these key Islamic principles into actions and really make a difference. I'm determined to use my life to create a real legacy in children's Islamic education, not just for me, but for everyone involved.Why It's Important We Gain YOUR Support!We need your support to make our vision a reality and create a real legacy in children's Islamic educational publishing! 
Our vision is to create a legacy of accessible, high quality resources of on-going, beneficial knowledge which aim to (God Willing) inspire generations to come.

We’ve tried to find beautiful, creative and interactive resources that can encourage children to learn more about the magnificent stories from the Holy Quran. 

All the adults we’d spoken to had very fond memories of reading pop-up books as children and told us they’d love to have the same resources to teach their children more about the Quran.
We invite you to support us, to pre-order your exclusive signed copy and be a part of the Shade 7 legacy to make our vision a reality for all children to enjoy!Features of the book: Why it's so special!
Hand drawn & painted, creative illustrations with exceptional colour and design throughout the book
A variety of carefully thought out pop-up features, interactive flaps and tabs to really bring the story to life like never before
Educational quiz to test your knowledge of the story 
Colouring play mat and press-out pieces to create your own army of elephants to re-enact some of the historic scenes from the story
Hardback cover with high quality finish throughout
Beautiful, luxurious, gold foil stamped, hand designed title on the cover
Our book is double the size of a standard children’s pop-up story book, containing 13 spreads
Each of the pop-up features in the book are put together by hand
What We Need & What You GetWe need to raise £40,000 to help us with the initial production costs of 5,000 copies of our magnificent Pop-up Story of The Elephant: Surah Al-Fil Pop-up Book to arrive God willing, in time for Eid 2014. That's just 1185 more people pre-ordering our special book for only £26 including UK postage!The Pop-up Development ProcessPop-up books require a large amount of expensive tooling in order to be produced and the assembly is nearly all manual labour, making the production costs per unit higher than traditional book printing.That's why we need your support! What You GetIn exchange and as a THANK YOU for being a part of our legacy, we have some really creative special perks for you. We also have additional exclusive benefits for all our initial supporters from this crowd-funding campaign.All supporters purchasing a book will:
Form an exclusive online community, receiving previews of future titles before they are released;
Have the opportunity to pre-order the next title and limited edition versions before we take them to market; and 
Receive exclusive updates on the development of the 3D digital interactive Story of The Elephant: Surah Al-Fil App.
*Our tentative delivery is expected just before Eid Al Fitr 2014 and email notices will be provided if any short delays surface.**Please note that the delivery charges for overseas orders may vary – please see the destinations list below for more accurate shipping details. We're all about Storytelling that touches for a lifetime, making a better world for people of all faiths.Testimonials, Partners & SupportersAs a young, ambitious  new publishing venture, we've received some incredible feedback from world-renowned international publishing houses, both mainstream and Islamic, who really value the contribution we are trying to make to the children's educational publishing world! My team and I have worked incredibly hard to produce some of the best quality, creative and innovative Pop-up books & 3D apps around, to teach children about Quranic and Prophetic stories in fun, interactive and memorable way.The Story of The Elephant, Surah Al-Fil Pop-up, is the first in our series and, if we get funded (God willing), we have plenty more Pop-up titles to come.It’s important to also emphasise, acknowledge and thank all the members of our team, friends, parents and children that have worked extremely hard to help us make the progress we've made and reach this stage. The ImpactThis project is much more than just publishing children’s Quranic Pop-up Books and 3D apps. It has a much deeper impact and intention for the future of children’s Islamic educational publishing.We’ve summarised the 7 key things which our project is all about: 
Creating a Legacy of outstandingly beautiful, long-lasting resources to pass on beneficial knowledge that teaches children about the importance of faith and the rich, valuable lessons from the stories in the Quran.
Creating Exceptional and inspirational designs of the highest quality in the material we publish.
Making our published materials Accessible to all children, from all backgrounds and faiths to enjoy. This is highlighted particularly through our commitment with our Charity Partner READ Foundation who champion education for all.  
Igniting a curiosity in all children to Discover the profound and exciting and moral stories in the Qur’an. For Muslim children, we hope it will inspire the discovery into the beauty of the Arabic language to understand the depth of these stories further.
Creating innovative Educational resources to make learning about Islam truly inspiring and fun for all.
Developing a deeper sense of Respect and tolerance in children from an early age towards other faiths and beliefs, bridging gaps and highlighting the similarities in the stories of the Old Testament to the Quranic stories in particular – something which will develop further as our series progresses.
Developing a child’s Spiritual needs and interests as they grow older, cultivating an awareness of their Creator and creating a bond with Him through fond memories of reading these sensational stories.
To date, many have sacrificed an incredible amount of time, goodwill and shown real belief and support in the worthwhile nature of this project. All the work on the book, from the illustrations, to the graphics, to the website, to all the important logistical stuff that no one really gets to see, like the accounts, legalities, advising and mentoring has ALL been done for FREE!We feel truly blessed and thankful for everyone that's supported and worked with us to be a part of our journey so far.  We’ve got some really exciting titles in our line-up for the Qur’anic Pop-up book series to bring to market if (God Willing) this campaign is successful!Our Charitable Commitment At Shade 7 we firmly believe in supporting the religious, spiritual and educational development of all children.Our commitment is to donate a minimum of 25 books for every 1,000 copies sold as gifts to less fortunate children around the world via our Charity Partner READ Foundation (Registered Charity Number 1114808) whose focus is on education for children in rural areas.We’d love for you to help us deliver on our promise to help make less fortunate children really happy too!We invite you to consider giving another child an opportunity to write their name on a copy of this beautiful book and have something of their own to treasure!We invite you to consider giving another child an opportunity to write their name on a copy of this beautiful book and have something of their own to treasure!

raised in Chicago as a child prodigy in piano performance and composition, and </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>also in drawing, and
later on, in dancing. The reason for this “prodigy” upbringing was that I have
been diagnosed with ASD around 4 years old. From there, I ended up in Beacon
Therapeutic School for about 15 years to help deal with my ASD condition and I
also saw plentiful evidence of other classmates having that condition. From
watching “Fame” on TV, Debbie Allen became one of my greatest idols to inspire
me to dance, so I taught myself ballet, jazz, and modern, even though I kept it
secret from my parents because of my ASD. Fortunately, I got my HS diploma in
1990, got a BM in Piano at Roosevelt University in 1994, and then an MM in
Piano at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1995, and got a DMA
in Piano at the same university in 2002.</span><br/></p>

<p>My writing gifts
started around 1995 or so, beginning with poetry, then to essays and short
stories, with several of them being published online through Digizine.com. <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Later on, as I
watched the movie “Rainman”, I did some more re-tracing on my life as someone </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>with ASD with help
from my surviving parents and relatives, and figured that I had lived </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>quite a unique
life. For example, in 1996, I fell in love with ballroom dancing and wanted to </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>be almost like
ballroom dance champion, Donnie Burns, after seeing the movie, “Shall We Dance?”
From there, I got my wish dancing in several amateur ballroom competitions, and</span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>made the finals in
a few of them. </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>In addition to that,
I was amassing more and more original and arranged compositions, mainly for the
piano. And I am still doing this. </span></p>
<p>The campaign will
focus on my major release of a self-published autobiography that is <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>inspired by my
experiences of having ASD. </span></p>
<p>From this autobiography, this campaign will most
likely be well-received by not only regular people who have ASD, but also
famous celebrities who also have been diagnosed with ASD as well. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>Because I am going
to do an autobiography that will likely be print-based as well as online, I was <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>thinking of doing 200
print copies for the book, which will include text and graphics on my own color
laser printer (the Dell C1660w), which I will need expensive OEM toner at least
12 times, and the printing costs will run about $6,000. (I ran some non-OEM
toner in that printer and regrettably the printer will not accept that paper.)
I was also going to send the copies through regular snail mail myself – 200
copies X $15.00 each book for shipping costs—turns out to be an extra $3,000. </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Then, I plan to get professional business cards
and business card resumes, as well as getting </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>extra paper and business cards to
promote my project, and use a few Facebook advertisements </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>to boost extra fans and backers
for my project, which turns out to be an extra $1,000 </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>in marketing costs.</span></p>
<p> Moreover, I know that some people
still like to read stuff in the regular way without using an e-<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>reader or e-Book. </span></p>
<p>The perks I have will
focus on my original <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>music CDs that
display my autistic talents for doing almost anything—from doing live </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>performances all
the way to doing avant-garde compositions. </span></p>
<p>If my goal of $10,000 is not reached by the deadline, the funds will still
be sent to my Paypal account, where it will be likely be used to pay the <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>needed expenses for
my campaign. </span></p>
</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>The project is very important to me
and to the world because I want to express several of my greatest <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>gifts I had as somebody who had
ASD—writing, and drawing, as well as music. And also, the topic of </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>ASD is now spread away from the
United States to parts of Europe and beyond, and more people are starting to
understand this rather tricky condition. I am a very gifted writer and ever
since I heard about </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>the amazing story of Carly
Fleischmann – whose life with ASD is almost a little bit like my past life – I
am </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>using her story as a major
inspiration to boost my existing writing gifts. </span></p>
<p>This will be my first ever
crowdfunding project that helps inspire people with autism. In the past, I had <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>a good track record as an writer
during my doctoral dissertation project, wrote numerous published blogs on
Blogger.com, and I also had started up a not-for-profit organization along with
my co-founder, Lynn West, called Celebration of Joy (established in 2014),
whose mission focuses on empowering people with autism. With the release of my
autobiography, the non-profit will have a great boost in our fanbase and in our
backers. </span></p>
<p>Right now, there is no way you can
escape being informed about autism. There are more recent news stories in both broadcast
and independent media that are covering more topics and discussions related to
autism-spectrum disorder, and the revelation of Jenny McCarthy having a son
with autism is a major example. Also, the stigma of people having ASD is
starting to fade a little bit, and people with ASD are coming up with creative
coping mechanisms to live as normal a life as possible, despite the condition.
I also had faced autism full-circle in myself and seeing other people with this
condition, so this will inspire me to write, and I hope that you will trust me
to help me succeed in this project. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>I do know that the main challenge for me are several, not just a single one. The first one is I have continued shyness related to my autism, and this means I am pretty reluctant to announce the Indiegogo campaign by word-of-mouth especially to people on the street that I do not know. </p>
<p>I am also aware that there is a chance that I will not make the goal of $10,000 as expected especially when you are crowdfunding for the first time. The way I can remedy that is to make sure that I have enough backers on Facebook and outside of Facebook to make this possible. </p>
<p>Another challenge is that I have a problem with procrastination, and right now, because I am doing some heavy editing and it involves a lot of proofreading page-by-page, and line-by-line (which is very time-consuming), this might mean an outside chance that the biography will not be in its final form past the deadline and will not be officially released or distributed, even if I do raise the $10,000 needed to do the publishing. </p>
<p>Then, there is the possibility that my printer could go down and this would mean that I will have to change to third-party printing services (Home Depot) to complete the final form of my autobiography. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>If you are unable to
contribute to the campaign because money is tight or if you are on a <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>fixed income, then
you can still announce this campaign by mainly doing this the “word-of </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>mouth” way---it is a
marketing technique that is free. </span></p>
<p>You can use
the Indiegogo share tools that the Indiegogo website provides to help me in <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>my
campaign. </span></p>

Love is something we all can feel and it makes each one of us feel special. In the world today, ""Us and Them"" is the problem, ""I and You"" is the solution. A love poem can speak to everyone, it is only the language that keep us apart.  Check out our page here That's why we write and translate poems in English, Arabic, Hebrew and French. The response is incredible. An ad on Facebook for only a few dollars reaches very far. Our mission is to reach all people, everywhere, in all languages.A Valentine to the World: Help raise a thousand dollars for our project to share love poetry with two million people around the world. A hundred thousand will engage by liking, commenting or sharing. (The numbers are based on our statistics so far. Marketers will be envious.)Here is an example of what we do:חכה לי שם Wait for me there هناك انتظرني (by Haneen Al Sayegh)Wait for me thereWhere clouds fallTo the skyThere, where the seaClimbs to the springsWhere the trees grow into seedsWait for me...Kiss me thereAt the junction of logic and reasonFollow my traceOver the paths of the impossibleWhere our lives grow into youthWait for meWe belong thereAway from the disappointment of realityThere's no place for us hereIn the land of the Familiar and the sleepersA land that blessesThe orphancy of the embryos in the wombsNo place for us on the land that resurrects the pulse of death in the veins of the livingAnd extinguishes the last buds of lifeIn the veins of deadNo place for us , on a landThat condemns a cotton woundBlesses a butcher's kissAnd any suicidal projectI'll wait for you awayOne eveningNaked from all my fearsRelaxed dreamyLaying on a piece of skyهناك انتظرنيعند تساقط الغيومإلى السماءهناك حيث يصعد البحرنحو الجداولحيث تنمو الاشجار إلى بذورانتظرني،هناك قبلنيعند مفترق المنطق و العقلاقتفي أثريفوق ممرات المستحيلهناك حيث تنحدر أعمارنانحو الشبابانتظرنيمكاننا هناكبعيداً عن خذلان الواقعلا مكان لنافي أرض المألوف و النيامأرض تباركيتم الأجنة في الأرحاملا مكان لنا على أرضتبعث نبض الموتفي عروق الاحياءو تطفئ آخر براعم الحياةفي أوردة الامواتلا مكان لنا على أرضتدين جرح القطنتبارك قبلة جزاروكل مشروع انتحاربعيداً سأنتظركذات مساءعارية من كل مخاوفيمسترخية حالمةراقدة فوق قطعة سماءחכה לי שםהיכן שהעננים נופליםלשמייםשם, היכן שהיםמטפס למעיינותהיכן שהעצים גדלים להיות זרעיםחכה לי...נשק אותי שםבצומת ההגיון והסיבותעקוב אחרי השובל שליבשבילי הבלתי אפשריהיכן שחיינו גדלים לנעוריםחכה ליאנחנו שייכים לשםהרחק מהאכזבה שלהמציאותאין לנו מקום כאןבארץ של המוכר ושל הנמיםארץ אשר מברכתאת היתמות של העוברים בתוך רחמםאין לנו מקום בארץ הזאת שמחייה את דופק המתים בתוך ורידי החייםומכבה את שאריות בדלי החיים בתוך ורידי המתיםאין לנו מקום בארץשמגנה פציעות כותנהמברכת נשיקותיו של הקצבוכל מבצע התאבדותאחכה לך הרחקערב אחדערומה מכל פחדיירגועה חולמניתנחה על חתיכת שמיים",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>What's it all About</strong></p>
<p>I lost my hearing when I was 27 years old.  I spent 5 years in hell.  It was one of the lowest points of my life.  I never had any guidance to help me understand the changes I needed to make to thrive in a deafie life. That was 16 years ago but I finally got it right.  Life is great now. I want to share what I have learned to help others adjust and thrive with late onset deafness.  Here is something to think about.</p>
<p>Late on-set hearing loss is a rampant disability that lives on the fringes of society.  It is not a cause that is championed in mainstream America.  People who suffer from a hearing loss suffer in their own silence.  They deny their own  communication needs to stay assimilated in hearing society due to negative views on deafness.  This type of action leads to isolation.</p>
<p>According to The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) approximately 17 percent (36 million) of American adults report some degree of hearing loss. Three out of every thousand children in the United States are born deaf or hard-of-hearing.  Over 4 million children are born each year that equates to over 12,300 children born with some form of hearing loss per year.  And yet when was the last time you saw a news segment about hearing loss or saw an article about a new book to help new deafies?</p>
<p>That is why I wrote ""A Survival Guide for New Deafies!"" To help people cope and deal with late onset deafness.  What hearing, newly deafened and newly hard of hearing people don't understand is losing your hearing affects EVERY aspect of how one lives their life.  Not making changes can cause a calamity of issues.  I'm not trying to sound all doom and gloom but New Deafies need new life skills or things are going to be tough for a very long time.  The cool thing is this little book is a very fast read, full of humor and anecdotes that can immediately make a positive difference in a new deafies life. The book is specifically designed to be able to be read out of sequence making it an easy reference source. </p>
<p><strong>How I've gotten to this point</strong></p>
<p>I wrote the book and used my savings to form a vanity press (Deaf Girl Publishing) to publish the book in June of 2011.   I have successfully used social media, guest speaking and book signings to ""spread the word"" to reach people who will benefit from the book.  The response has been great.  But my reach has been limited.  There are literally millions of people in the United States and abroad whose lives can be empowered and uplifted by this book.  I want to reach as many of them as I can, to help make a bad situation better.  So that people don't have to hide or suffer in silence anymore.</p>
<p><br/><strong> Current Projects</strong></p>
<p>I  will be using my Indiegogo funds to cover the cost of a book tour and app development.</p>
<p>The developing app will help deaf and hard of hearing people demonstrate the significance of their hearing loss to family, friends and co-workers.  This will help them better understand and appreciate how difficult it is for the deaf or hard of hearing person.  This app will compliment the book but sold separately.   The goal is to help new deafies and new hard of hearing people move from the fringes of society. </p>

<li>Second Edition</li>

<li>Translation (I have been amazed by the interest in my book from non-English speaking countries.)</li>
</ul><p><strong>And Lastly</strong></p>
<p>This is a labor of love for me, it is very near and dear to my heart because I have been forced to live with deafness.   And win, lose, or draw with this crowdfunding effort I am committed to getting my book out there.   I am only asking for your support so I can take my efforts to the next level and make an even bigger difference on a grander scale to reach the people who can benefit from the book.  Thank you for considering backing me.  For more info:<a href=""http://DeafGirlAmy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> http://DeafGirlAmy.com</a></p></div>","What's it all About

They reflect a continent on the move, one that is bustling with life, creativity, poverty, love, opportunity, hope, and promise - a far cry from the negative stereotypes that many have come to associate with Africa. Stretch Goals

If we raise $7,500, the extra money will go towards increasing the prize money for our monthly Africa Book Club Short Reads competition. 


If we raise $12,500, we will scale up our school library donation program, through which we provide books by African authors to school and college libraries in Africa. Every additional $500 raised, converts to a gift hamper of 20-30 books to a school or college library in Africa. 

What You GetWe’ve put together an exciting package of rewards for this project, including copies of the upcoming Africa Book Club Anthology of African Stories, which we plan to release in early 2014. In addition to copies of the anthology, we will be giving away a selection of award-winning books by African authors, including three titles that have previously won the Man Booker prize and works by four African authors, who have received the Nobel Prize in Literature. Other Ways You Can HelpRemember, if you can't help with a contribution, you can help immensely by sharing this campaign with your social networks, friends, colleagues, family and everyone. Every bit helps us reach our goals.Be a part of this effort to change the narrative on Africa. Help fund our campaign.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

Gradually, you will allow yourself to be carried into Anna´s world, and you will meet different men and women and discover a path full of contradictions and nuances. The author reveals not only paintings of the outside world, but also a sincere encounter, sometimes hard, sometimes pleasant, with herself and with the essence of travel and life</i>.

<h1>El libro </h1>
<div>La novela <i>El Otro Río</i>,  está escrita por Anna e ilustrada con dibujos de Diego y fotografías de Anna.  Nuestro gran proyecto es <b>armar un puente sólido entre nosotros y ustedes, </b>para compartir años de experiencias, de vivir y sentir, de viajar, asi como nuestra mirada sobre el mundo que nos rodea. <p>       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1046189/files/20141125094236-anna.jpg?1416937356"" src="""" style=""width: 287.21px; height: 225px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1046192/files/20141125094330-Diego.jpg?1416937410"" src="""" style=""width: 284.46px; height: 224px;""/></p>
<div>Críticas. <p></p>
<p>“Si el tiempo para nuestros dos viajeros se deshizo sobre el camino, las horas se le escapan al lector al abrir el libro... De a poco, uno se deja llevar y envolver por el mundo que Anna descubre, se encuentra con hombres y mujeres muy distintos y un camino lleno de contradicciones y matices. La autora  revela no solamente pinturas del mundo exterior, sino de un encuentro sincero, a veces difícil a veces placentero, con ella misma y con la esencia del viaje y de la vida”, Gustavo Peña, 2014.</p>
<p>“Los dibujos de Diego siempre me dejan suspendido.  En ellos encuentro historias y se revelan imágenes que a primera vista no había percibido. Me gustan. Parecen un sueño, o una visión. Siempre al mirarlos me embarga una sensación de inmensa soledad”, Lin Zhen, 2014.</p>

The Other River: “It is a book not to be missed, a book to devour, which makes us want to grab a backpack, or to simply look at the world on the other side of the window with different eyes. Discover a couple, an adventure, a unique perspective of the world.” Lea Nasca, 2014.

About us

Diego and Anna two untiring travelers. Eight years of challenges, love and fantasy.




We met eight years ago, and soon thereafter left everything: Diego his life as a banker, Anna her cinematography studies. We thought to travel for one year and then return to our sedentary life, but we soon adopted a nomadic life, to discover the world in which we live, their people and ourselves. Passionate dreamers, we make the reality a way of life with love and fantasy. Now with two children born on the trip, we will soon jump back onto our tandem bike (a bicycle for two) and, all together, continue onwards to new horizons.  
Our page, www.xurruruca.com         

We work and share our art work in art festival, meetings, and on the street.
You may see our work at www.xurruruca.com/galerias.php                        


             







The Book 
The Other River is written by Anna, and it is illustrated by Diego's drawings and Anna's photographs. Our major project is to build a strong bridge between us and others, to share years of experiences, of living and feeling, as well as our view of the world that surrounds us. Eight years ago Anna began to take notes and Diego to make sketches, and for the last two years they have be shaping what is now the book.
   
Anna has loved literature since young. She has written poetry, short stories and scripts for short films. Meanwhile Diego has always been attracted to drawing and painting, and his work has been widely exhibited around the world.

Other Reviews                  
While time vanished for our travelers along the road, the hours escape from the reader upon opening the book.... Gradually, you will allow yourself to be carried into Anna´s world, and you will meet different men and women and discover a path full of contradictions and nuances. The author reveals not only paintings of the outside world, but also a sincere encounter, sometimes hard, sometimes pleasant, with herself and with the essence of travel and life. Gustavo Peña, 2014.
“Diego´s drawings always leave me suspended. In them, I find stories and images which at first I had not noticed. I like them. They seem a dream or a vision. I was captivated by a feeling of immense loneliness.” Lin Zhen, 2014.

Nosotros.
Diego y Anna, dos viajeros incansables. Ocho años de desafíos, de amor y de fantasías.
Nos conocimos hace ocho años y poco tiempo después dejamos todo: Diego su vida de banquero, Anna sus estudios de cinematografía. Pensábamos viajar un año y volver a la vida sedentaria, pero pronto adoptamos una vida nómada y libre, para descubrir el mundo en el que vivimos, sus habitantes, y a nosotros mismos. Apasionados y soñadores, hacemos que la realidad sea una herramienta para vivir de amor y fantasías. Ahora con dos hijos nacidos en el viaje, pensamos pronto retomar nuestro tándem (una bicicleta doble), y de a cuatro seguir hacia nuevos horizontes.
Nuestra página, www.xurruruca.com



Trabajamos y compartimos nuestros trabajos artísticos en festivales, conferencias, y en la calle.
Pueden ver algo de nuestro trabajo en www.xurruruca.com/galerias.php

                   



El libro 
La novela El Otro Río,  está escrita por Anna e ilustrada con dibujos de Diego y fotografías de Anna.  Nuestro gran proyecto es armar un puente sólido entre nosotros y ustedes, para compartir años de experiencias, de vivir y sentir, de viajar, asi como nuestra mirada sobre el mundo que nos rodea.        
Críticas. 
“Si el tiempo para nuestros dos viajeros se deshizo sobre el camino, las horas se le escapan al lector al abrir el libro... De a poco, uno se deja llevar y envolver por el mundo que Anna descubre, se encuentra con hombres y mujeres muy distintos y un camino lleno de contradicciones y matices. La autora  revela no solamente pinturas del mundo exterior, sino de un encuentro sincero, a veces difícil a veces placentero, con ella misma y con la esencia del viaje y de la vida”, Gustavo Peña, 2014.
“Los dibujos de Diego siempre me dejan suspendido.  En ellos encuentro historias y se revelan imágenes que a primera vista no había percibido. Me gustan. Parecen un sueño, o una visión. Siempre al mirarlos me embarga una sensación de inmensa soledad”, Lin Zhen, 2014.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<h2><strong>Here's a quick historical perspective. </strong></h2>
<p>Publishers used to make sure all books were edited to perfection and designed by sophisticated layout artists and illustrators. They prepared the manuscript for printing on expensive typesetting equipment, proofread it twice, printed 5,000 or more copies, and aggressively sold them through bookstores. Publishers and authors made money and created good reputations for important books.</p>
<p>On the flip side, many books went unpublished. The perfect storm of the mid-1990s, brought together personal computers, the Internet and eCommerce (specifically <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amazon.com</a>), allowing authors to self-publish, by-passing the big publishers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Exciting times indeed – or not! </strong></h2>
<p>Many authors unfamiliar with the publishing process had no criteria to evaluate their self-publishing options. So, as often happens, unscrupulous people with big promises jumped in to prey on the naiveté of aspiring authors. This is even more true today.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The numbers tell the story.  </strong></h2>
<p><em>Publisher’s Weekly</em> reports: in 2011 authors paid an average cost to produce a print-on-demand (POD) book of $5,000 - $15,000, with the average number of books sold being only 150. PODs have become so lucrative that Author Solutions (a group of POD publishers) was recently sold to the owners of Penguin Books for an astounding <strong>$116 million in cash</strong>.</p>

<p>Alafia (Peace) I am Khafre K. Abif, AIDS Activist and I have been thriving with HIV for 23 years. I have compiled an anthology of inspirational prayers, poems and affirmations to support the souls and uplift the spirits of People Living with HIV/AIDS.For the last eighteen month the submissions have touched my soul, made me cry, filled me with hope, and connected me to an international community of compassionate contributors who have shared their work to empower my world.</p>
<p>I believe that there is healing in prayer. I know that words have power. I needed to provide this collection of words that will combat the words that are so often hear spoken to someone with HIV. This is my effort to help combat HIV-related stigma. AIDS-related stigma and discrimination refers to prejudice, negative attitudes, abuse and maltreatment directed at people living with <a href=""http://www.avert.org/hiv.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""><strong>HIV</strong></a> and <a href=""http://www.avert.org/aids.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""><strong>AIDS</strong></a>. The consequences of stigma and discrimination are wide-ranging: being shunned by family, peers and the wider community, poor treatment in healthcare and education settings, an erosion of rights, psychological damage, and a negative effect on the success of HIV testing and treatment. The idea for the anthology grew out of my work as an HIV Test Counselor. Each time I had to share with someone that they tested positive for HIV one of the first issues for them was disclosure.</p>

Crushed when he realizes he is different looking from all his favorite book characters, he goes off to right what he feels is a wrong. His path leads him to trouble but, also, to healing and empowerment as he reconnects with the stories of his ancestors from the Philippines.</p><p>Vibrantly illustrated by Lynnor Bontigao with characters based on Filipino mythology- the <i>sirena</i> (mermaid),<i> syokoy</i> (mermen), and <i>diwata</i> (fairies), to name a few- <i>Jack Meets Agyu</i> is sure to draw kids into an adventure that is exciting as much as it is self-affirming!</p><p><i>Jack Meets Agyu</i> is written by Justine Villanueva in English and includes a translation in <i>Binukid</i>, one of the indigenous languages in Bukidnon, a region in the south of the Philippines. The book also provides translations into <i>Filipino</i>, the national language of the Philippines, and <i>Bisaya-Cebuano</i>, one of the major languages in the Philippines. Additionally, the book features the Baybayin script, a Tagalog based ancient script.</p><p><br/><strong>The Inspiration</strong></p><p>We were inspired to write <i>Jack Meets Agyu</i>  after sadly finding a lack of children's books featuring kids of color or focusing on Filipino culture.  It was also inspired by personal stories from family and friends, including: </p><ol>
<li>Justine's son, Charlie, is an avid Harry Potter Fan, but he announced he could not possibly be Harry for Halloween because he had a different skin color. Despite his parents' encouragement, Charlie would not change his mind.</li>
<li>One of Justine's Filipino friends shared that she had once given her young son an illustrated book that featured brown kids. The boy was confused because he had not seen kids of color in books before. So he used an eraser and a white crayon to ""fix"" what he said was the character's ""dirty skin.""  </li>
</ol><p><i>Jack Meets Agyu</i>  tells a deeper story that so many kids of color experience - a feeling of being the ""other"", of being different looking and therefore not normal or accepted. Through our book, we offer kids of color a way to belong, build their identity, and expand their aspirations by reconnecting with their ancestral stories and their indigenous roots.</p><p>We also explore in <i>Jack Meets Agyu</i> the seed of resistance. Agyu is celebrated in the Bukidnon epic, the Ulaging, as the cultural hero who helps the Bukidnon people escape from the oppression of the Spanish colonizers and into immortal life in the heavens. Thus, as a Filipino-American, and therefore of a people with a history of centuries of struggle against colonization and racism, Jack's legacy from his lolos/lolas (elders) and ancestors is one of resistance. Even at a young age, Jack already knows how to exercise his autonomy and right to self-represent. </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>ABOUT OUR PRESS: Goals and Journey</strong></u></p><p>We are <strong>Sawaga River Press</strong>, the publishing arm of <strong><i>Libro Para Sa Tanan</i>, A Literacy Project</strong>, affectionately called <strong>Our Libro</strong>, a California 501(c)(3) nonprofit. <strong>Sawaga River Press </strong>creates children's books by Filipino authors and artists that celebrate Filipino experiences and culture, especially those that are rooted in the Filipino and Bukidnon indigenous values.</p><p>Our website is <a href=""https://www.ourlibro.org/sawagariverpress"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.ourlibro.org/sawagariverpress</a>. </p><p><strong>Our Goals of Diversity and Equity</strong></p><p>We are excited to share <i>Jack Meets Agyu</i> with the world because it is the kind of book we wish there were more of for kids to read. Recent data show that while brown kids are showing up in higher numbers in children's books, these brown kids are of unspecified race or ethnicity, and the stories have no visible cultural markers in either the story or the art. <i>Jack Meets Agyu</i> tells the story from a distinctly Filipino-American child's perspective.</p><p>Not only are Filipino-American kids missing from children's books, so are the Filipino-American authors and artists. Our press is founded on the belief that we need to advance the publication of our own stories by providing Filipino-American authors and artists professional opportunities.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Our Journey As A Press</strong></p><p>In 2016, <strong>Sawaga River Press</strong> published <i>Mama, Mama, Know What I Like? </i>through a successful crowdfunding campaign. The funds that we raised helped us not only with the publishing but also with the development of our nonprofit.</p><p>Years after the book's publication, parents and children still share with us how much <i>Mama, Mama, Know What I Like?</i> means to them. We have learned so much in the publication and distribution of our first book and can't wait to put that experience to work for <i>Jack Meets Agyu</i> and for the many more books we plan to publish as we build on the work of our press (and the nonprofit) which focuses on the reclamation of our Filipino and Bukidnon indigenous identities.</p><p>With your continued support, we will not only publish charming and beautiful hardbounds that allow kids of color like Jack to see themselves and their experiences in books, but we will also keep growing as an independent press that is committed to cultivating indigeneity and one that props up Filipino authors and illustrators.  </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>OUR CREATIVE TEAM</strong></u><br/> </p><p><strong>Lynnor Bontigao,</strong> the Illustrator, graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Visual Communication/Advertising from the University of the Philippines. She was a member of the <strong>InK</strong> (<i>Illustrador ng Kabataan</i>), a Philippine based group pf children's book illustrators.

She came to the United States when she was 16 years old. She writes about the struggles and triumphs of Filipino immigrants in the United States. She also writes about Bukidnon culture in <a href=""https://ginikanan.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ginikanan.com</a> so that her two young sons could know more about their Bukidnon roots.

Jack Meets Agyu  tells a deeper story that so many kids of color experience - a feeling of being the ""other"", of being different looking and therefore not normal or accepted. Through our book, we offer kids of color a way to belong, build their identity, and expand their aspirations by reconnecting with their ancestral stories and their indigenous roots.We also explore in Jack Meets Agyu the seed of resistance. Agyu is celebrated in the Bukidnon epic, the Ulaging, as the cultural hero who helps the Bukidnon people escape from the oppression of the Spanish colonizers and into immortal life in the heavens. Thus, as a Filipino-American, and therefore of a people with a history of centuries of struggle against colonization and racism, Jack's legacy from his lolos/lolas (elders) and ancestors is one of resistance. Even at a young age, Jack already knows how to exercise his autonomy and right to self-represent.  ABOUT OUR PRESS: Goals and JourneyWe are Sawaga River Press, the publishing arm of Libro Para Sa Tanan, A Literacy Project, affectionately called Our Libro, a California 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Sawaga River Press creates children's books by Filipino authors and artists that celebrate Filipino experiences and culture, especially those that are rooted in the Filipino and Bukidnon indigenous values.Our website is https://www.ourlibro.org/sawagariverpress. Our Goals of Diversity and EquityWe are excited to share Jack Meets Agyu with the world because it is the kind of book we wish there were more of for kids to read. Recent data show that while brown kids are showing up in higher numbers in children's books, these brown kids are of unspecified race or ethnicity, and the stories have no visible cultural markers in either the story or the art. Jack Meets Agyu tells the story from a distinctly Filipino-American child's perspective.Not only are Filipino-American kids missing from children's books, so are the Filipino-American authors and artists. Our press is founded on the belief that we need to advance the publication of our own stories by providing Filipino-American authors and artists professional opportunities. Our Journey As A PressIn 2016, Sawaga River Press published Mama, Mama, Know What I Like? through a successful crowdfunding campaign. The funds that we raised helped us not only with the publishing but also with the development of our nonprofit.Years after the book's publication, parents and children still share with us how much Mama, Mama, Know What I Like? means to them. We have learned so much in the publication and distribution of our first book and can't wait to put that experience to work for Jack Meets Agyu and for the many more books we plan to publish as we build on the work of our press (and the nonprofit) which focuses on the reclamation of our Filipino and Bukidnon indigenous identities.With your continued support, we will not only publish charming and beautiful hardbounds that allow kids of color like Jack to see themselves and their experiences in books, but we will also keep growing as an independent press that is committed to cultivating indigeneity and one that props up Filipino authors and illustrators.   OUR CREATIVE TEAM Lynnor Bontigao, the Illustrator, graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Visual Communication/Advertising from the University of the Philippines. She was a member of the InK (Illustrador ng Kabataan), a Philippine based group pf children's book illustrators. She is a member of US based Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI) and PuddleJump Collective, an international group of authors and illustrators dedicated to children's literature. She lives with her husband and two children in New Jersey. Her website is lynnorbontigao.com Justine Villanueva,  the Author, was born and raised in Bukidnon, Philippines. She came to the United States when she was 16 years old. She writes about the struggles and triumphs of Filipino immigrants in the United States. She also writes about Bukidnon culture in ginikanan.com so that her two young sons could know more about their Bukidnon roots. When not writing, Justine spends time with her family, teaches dance, and investigates alternative ways of living and being. She lives in Davis, California with her husband and two young boys.OUR INDIEGOGO FLEXIBLE GOAL: $11,000 AND WHYWe aim to raise $11,000.

 RISKS AND CHALLENGESLike any independent small press, we're dependent on supporters like you to fund our efforts. We know we're asking a lot, but believe it's well worth your time and money.

It's a fantasy story that happens in China 7000 years ago. It took me over a year to get it done. But fantasy movie scripts are hard to sell to studios. They involve a lot of special effects and cost a lot of money. That's why studios prefer to invest on properties that have an established market, hence all the super hero movies. So I decided to convert my script into a book, hoping that if the book is successful, it will be much easier to get the movie made. English being my second language, I don't have the necessary skills to write a book (in English) that would be worthy of being published. So I wrote it in French. Everybody I showed it too loved the story. But there is no market for original fantasy books in French. They are all translations from English books. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What I'm looking for is funding for the translation. The book has 80 000 words, which is the size of the first Harry Potter. I sent a sample to a few professional translators and I found the one that really did a great translation in the spirit of the original story. </p>
<p>I took the decision to give a digital copy to any contributor, even if it's only 1$. Am I shooting myself in the foot knowing that very few people will give me more than a dollar? Maybe. But this is how I want to thank you for helping me. If you feel that getting a book should worth more than a dollar, feel free to contribute more. :-)</p>
<p>You can find a sample of the translation <a href=""http://robertrioux.com/QuestSample.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Getting this book translated by a professional will allow me to present it to publishers or even self publish on Amazon. It will add an incredible production value to the project. It's the only way that movie can be made. I worked so much on this projet, it's very frustrating to see it sleep on my hard drive. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The only risk is that I can't find enough money to get the translation done. But I will find a way to get it translated. I will not let this project go down. I invested too much of my time in it. It will happen. I will make sure that it does. If I only find a third of the money, then I'll get the first third translated. And from there, It may be easier to approach publisher. If they like the first third, they may want to invest for the rest of the translation. </p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<strong><i>The Journey is the Destination: The Case for Holistic, Restorative Education</i></strong> is my storied take on how education must transform in order to meet the needs of young people in today’s globalized and precarious world. Rather than being mired in test scores and returns-on-investment, education has to recognize the forces which threaten civilization itself: global inequality and climate change. In response to these macro-trends, education must center the whole student and prepare them to be problem-solvers, change-makers, and responsible citizens of the modern world. Unfortunately, there is no more time to waste.<br/><br/>I drew inspiration to write this book from my journey through public, private, charter, and magnet schools. After attending a magnet high school in Las Vegas, I went to Georgetown University, and this transition put me face-to-face with the scope of economic inequality in the modern United States. My high school was surrounded by convenience stores, liquor stores, and apartment complexes, whereas my college was a billion-dollar school in the nation’s capital with towering stone and brick buildings.<br/><br/>I had reached the promised land my parents had wished for me; with a Georgetown degree, I would probably never struggle to find work. And yet, despite earning a high GPA, I struggled with loneliness, anxiety, and depression throughout college. In other words, I was a Gilded Student; golden grades and a golden smile enabled me to hide my struggle from my peers and professors.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I studied the ails of society in the classroom—from climate change to global racism—thereby adding an existential twinge to my daily stresses. Eventually, I came to realize that my struggles with mental health, my façade resume, and the problems facing the world were all engaged in a tragic and dissonant dance. Although my reckoning with the education system may seem melodramatic, it is common to many struggling with mental health issues. Each of us is introduced to the path to personal excellence, wealth, and social status—all while knowing that global forces threaten our future.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I believe that changing our core educational framework can provide leverage for change in the rest of society. By prioritizing the flourishing of students in community, education can evolve into a training ground for democracy, a hub for innovative solutions, and a bastion for equality.<br/><br/>In these pages, we’ll explore how we can cultivate a new form of education which channels the individual talents of young people into careers and lifestyles that will lead to both personal fulfillment and global problem-solving. Specifically, we’ll see:<ul>
<li>How project-based learning might help revive our democracy.</li>
<li>How social media is making Gen Z into the “Doomer Generation.”</li>
<li>How The Pivotal Network is attempting to reduce economic inequality in colleges.</li>
</ul>If you’ve ever questioned the point of education, or believe in its power as a transformative force for good, you will definitely like this book. Regardless of your beliefs, my biggest hope is that you’ll feel a newfound appreciation for education, learning, and growth.<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>New Degree Press will be publishing my book. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the publishing costs. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>
<strong>The editor</strong> I'll work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021.</li>
<li>
<strong>The cover design</strong> of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>
<strong>The layout design</strong> for the pages of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>
<strong>The copy editing</strong> for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>
<strong>The launch &amp; promotion efforts</strong> for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring.</li>
</ul>As soon as I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I’ll publish a paperback and ebook. At 150 copies, I’ll publish a hardcover. At 200, I’ll publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/>If you pre-order I’ll give you a huge thanks and these added perks!<ol>
<li>Personally signed copy of my book when published.</li>
<li>Your name in the Acknowledgments section.</li>
<li>Early access to the Intro and other excerpts and a chance to give me your early feedback.</li>
<li>Opportunity to help me select my cover and title.</li>
<li>Invitation to join my Author Community, where you’ll see the behind-the-scenes of the publishing process.</li>
<li>And more! :)</li>
</ol>
<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Michael Pasimio is a Las Vegas native and attends Georgetown University's world-renowned Walsh School of Foreign Service. He works at The Hub for Equity and Innovation in Higher Education and serves as Co-Chair of the Student Experience Committee. Throughout his time at Georgetown, he’s worked closely to organize and promote equity and diversity initiatives. He’s also partnered with various organizations around education and youth development, including Gentlemen By Choice and the International Youth Foundation.<br/><br/>His passion for education comes from his personal journey through private, public, magnet, and charter schools in Las Vegas, which is consistently at the bottom of national rankings. In 2018, Michael enrolled in Georgetown, and in his first year, the school made national news during the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal, but he learned firsthand how the scandal only scratched the surface of the faults within the education system. He took it upon himself to find solutions to these problems by providing college counseling to students from his high school at no cost and promoting educational equity among the student body. Michael also joined The Pivotal Network at Georgetown to help make college more affordable and accessible to first-generation and lower-income students.<br/><br/>In his free time, Michael reads, watches anime, walks his dogs, and hosts education brainstorming sessions with his friends. He always finds ways to attend events and meet new people, and he loves it when other people share their story.<br/><br/>You can connect with Michael at mvp36@georgetown.edu and follow him on Instagram @magic.mikey21.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk of publishing a book is mailing a physical copy to my supporters. Fortunately, I’ve included the cost of mailing and shipping into my pre-order goals, so we don’t have to worry.<br/><br/>This risk itself depends a lot on the publisher, but New Degree Press is extremely reliable in making sure that all the perks of pre-order are delivered ASAP. I’ll keep all my supporters in the loop on my book publishing date, and you’ll know when you can expect the physical book to be in your hands.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. You can use #EduJourney and tag me (@magic.mikey21) as well as my publisher, New Degree Press (@newdegreepress).</p>
<ol>
<li>You can easily share my pre-sale campaign via Indiegogo at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message.</li>
<li>Send me words of support and encouragement.</li>

Unfortunately, there is no more time to waste.I drew inspiration to write this book from my journey through public, private, charter, and magnet schools. After attending a magnet high school in Las Vegas, I went to Georgetown University, and this transition put me face-to-face with the scope of economic inequality in the modern United States. My high school was surrounded by convenience stores, liquor stores, and apartment complexes, whereas my college was a billion-dollar school in the nation’s capital with towering stone and brick buildings.I had reached the promised land my parents had wished for me; with a Georgetown degree, I would probably never struggle to find work. And yet, despite earning a high GPA, I struggled with loneliness, anxiety, and depression throughout college. In other words, I was a Gilded Student; golden grades and a golden smile enabled me to hide my struggle from my peers and professors.Meanwhile, I studied the ails of society in the classroom—from climate change to global racism—thereby adding an existential twinge to my daily stresses. Eventually, I came to realize that my struggles with mental health, my façade resume, and the problems facing the world were all engaged in a tragic and dissonant dance. Although my reckoning with the education system may seem melodramatic, it is common to many struggling with mental health issues. Each of us is introduced to the path to personal excellence, wealth, and social status—all while knowing that global forces threaten our future.Fortunately, I believe that changing our core educational framework can provide leverage for change in the rest of society. By prioritizing the flourishing of students in community, education can evolve into a training ground for democracy, a hub for innovative solutions, and a bastion for equality.In these pages, we’ll explore how we can cultivate a new form of education which channels the individual talents of young people into careers and lifestyles that will lead to both personal fulfillment and global problem-solving. Specifically, we’ll see:
How project-based learning might help revive our democracy.
How social media is making Gen Z into the “Doomer Generation.”
How The Pivotal Network is attempting to reduce economic inequality in colleges.
If you’ve ever questioned the point of education, or believe in its power as a transformative force for good, you will definitely like this book. Regardless of your beliefs, my biggest hope is that you’ll feel a newfound appreciation for education, learning, and growth.What I Need & What You'll GetNew Degree Press will be publishing my book.

About the Author
Michael Pasimio is a Las Vegas native and attends Georgetown University's world-renowned Walsh School of Foreign Service. He works at The Hub for Equity and Innovation in Higher Education and serves as Co-Chair of the Student Experience Committee. Throughout his time at Georgetown, he’s worked closely to organize and promote equity and diversity initiatives. He’s also partnered with various organizations around education and youth development, including Gentlemen By Choice and the International Youth Foundation.His passion for education comes from his personal journey through private, public, magnet, and charter schools in Las Vegas, which is consistently at the bottom of national rankings. In 2018, Michael enrolled in Georgetown, and in his first year, the school made national news during the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal, but he learned firsthand how the scandal only scratched the surface of the faults within the education system. He took it upon himself to find solutions to these problems by providing college counseling to students from his high school at no cost and promoting educational equity among the student body. Michael also joined The Pivotal Network at Georgetown to help make college more affordable and accessible to first-generation and lower-income students.In his free time, Michael reads, watches anime, walks his dogs, and hosts education brainstorming sessions with his friends. He always finds ways to attend events and meet new people, and he loves it when other people share their story.You can connect with Michael at mvp36@georgetown.edu and follow him on Instagram @magic.mikey21.
 
Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk of publishing a book is mailing a physical copy to my supporters. Fortunately, I’ve included the cost of mailing and shipping into my pre-order goals, so we don’t have to worry.This risk itself depends a lot on the publisher, but New Degree Press is extremely reliable in making sure that all the perks of pre-order are delivered ASAP. I’ll keep all my supporters in the loop on my book publishing date, and you’ll know when you can expect the physical book to be in your hands.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>Story of My Book</h2><p><i>I Am Racist?!: And other things I knew but was too ashamed to talk about</i> is my memoir and research project exploring the collision course of the middle-class, progressive, motherhood midlife crisis and anti-racist practice.<br/><br/>My name is Holly Harper and I am the author of <i>I Am Racist?! </i>Millennial and Xennial progressive women are often shamed into a position of believing that our own experience of individual trauma is invalid because “We have it so good that we have no right to complain.” This story is how I pushed back on that narrative, suffered openly, and transformed into a stronger, happier, and more empathetic human, embracing the matriarchal values that are the only path forward for a truly equitable, anti-racist society.<br/><br/>As a first-generation college graduate and a newly minted East Coast elite, I would frequently look in my rear-view mirror and see all of my segregated white peers in their small white Oregon town and think: “I got out. I made it. I’m living the perfect, progressive version of Stepford Wives.” Smug AF.<br/><br/>And then my ivory tower came crumbling down. I went from being a smug newlywed to a new mother coping with postpartum anxiety, to an entrepreneur, to a feminist, to a divorced, single, traumatized, and midlife-crisis-having adulteress. Those experiences revealed that I had everything backward. I had fucked it all up.<br/><br/>Having the world tell you “you’re lucky to have what you have” when you feel like a shameful failure of a woman, mother, wife, and person is a painful, humiliating, and isolating experience. I know I have more than so many others. I know I am privileged and have advantages from my white skin, middle-class upbringing, and stable income through marriage. But I am still broken.<br/><br/>If the pain is real, then the reasons behind that pain must matter, right? Pain matters.<br/><br/>I started writing. I was typing 10,000 words a weekend. I felt myself moving through my trauma.<br/><br/>And then George Floyd was murdered.<br/><br/>You need to read this book if you look at your wedding photos and don’t see a Black person (thank you Robin DiAngelo for that suggestion). You need to read this book if you feel overwhelmed by life and feel shame because you are privileged and whining about it. You need to read this book if you are absolutely certain you are not racist, or <i>that</i> racist, or maybe just were “sheltered” in a mostly white community, or get annoyed by #blacklivesmatter when Indigenous lives matter, too. You need to read this book if you’re a college-educated, white, cis, mom who wants the world to be better and America to live up to its ideals.<br/><br/><i>I Am Racist?!</i> speaks to white women, white moms, and progressive white people who want to grapple with living their best lives, self-care, healing from trauma, and finding your highest joy while also figuring out how to do all of that self-focused work without feeling overwhelming guilt and helplessness about the larger problems in our society.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>I Am Racist?!</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>Am I building a life of joy for myself, my partner, my children?</li>
<li>How do I overcome shame and childhood trauma to find my purpose?</li>
<li>What if I royally fuck up and cheat on my husband or become a binge drinker or otherwise do some really big damage? Will I lose everything? Am I worthless? Why do I feel trapped and alone?</li>
<li>What is the path forward for me if I truly am ready to start self-care and realign my values?</li>
<li>How can I have both maximum personal joy AND be committed to social justice and anti racist practice? I mean can we indulge in all-inclusive vacations and kitchen renovations and still become allies? (Hint: Yes.)</li>
</ul><p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing this complex dynamic will change us all for the better.</p><h3><strong><i>I Am Racist?! And other things I knew but was too ashamed to talk about </i>is written in Four Parts....</strong></h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Part 1 </strong>is about the very real and very painful experience of the female midlife crisis, based on expert research and interviews, we talk about how therapy, self-care, coaching, and lifestyle influencers are selling us bandage solutions to real, persistent sociological problems for middle-class, college educated Millennial and Xennial moms and womxn.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Part 2</strong> centers on how individual context - who you were raised to be as a woman, mom, professional, and “wife” confounds our progress further, creating a trap where we feel guilty and indulgent when seeking ways to heal our souls and bodies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Part 3</strong> is how we can meld together the high ideals of social justice - feminism, racial equality, gender equality, all the equalities - into one, more powerful perspective that gives us the grace be individually whole, brave, and happy while also fighting for what’s fundamentally the most important issue in our society today - social and racial justice. In short, we can walk and chew gum at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Part 4</strong> is where I am today, at the dawn of ‘woke’ and not an expert, but a practitioner in a lifelong journey with my compass pointed more firmly in the right direction.</p></li>
</ul><h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press of Potomac, Maryland. In order to fund the editing, printing, marketing and publication, I am offering book pre-orders:</p><ul>
<li>The editing team I will work with to revise and publish the manuscript in December, 2020.</li>
<li>The cover design - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The interior layout (physical copy and ebook formats)</li>
<li>Copyediting</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts, like the cool video they made me!</li>
</ul><p>My goal is to pre-sell 200 copies in order to publish in hardcover (vanity project), softcover, and eBook. Audiobook is on the docket, too. I have lofty goals.<br/><br/>To my beloved community of pre-orders, you’ll be getting the Cadillac treatment. You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish (I know, don’t get overly excited about this part). Additionally, you may get:</p><ul>
<li>Your name the Acknowledgements Section.</li>
<li>Early access to the Introduction of some additional sections of my manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.</li>
<li>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover.</li>
<li>I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book.</li>
<li>Your very own rose gold pen to underline all of the important sections you’ll be referencing later at Book Club.</li>
<li>A personalized pack of Kleenex to wipe up all of your fragile, white woman tears.</li>
<li>A set of versatile drink coaster/postcards to protect your furniture while drinking heavily after reading this shit (and then for mailing to all of your other potentially racist friends.).</li>
</ul><h3><strong>About Holly Harper</strong></h3><p>I am a strategic marketing consultant and copywriter at the helm of her my own consulting practice, Blue Bike Communications. I work with organizations tired of feeling buried under all the marketing stuff they have to do and want to do, and they’re ready to tighten up their marketing machine so they can do what they do best: make a difference in the world. As the ad hoc marketing director, we brand, strategize, plan and implement phased change for measurable results.<br/><br/>My writing was framed by a desire to take my personal perspectives, mostly in blog form, and translate them into a “larger picture” that addresses complex intersectional issues that are rarely addressed (racism, feminism, capitalism) in my own peer group (college educated, white, cis, married women who grew up in largely racially segregated worlds).<br/><br/>I’ve always been curious - devouring books, asking questions, solving puzzles, learning about new places, and helping others - resulting in the development of an eclectic collection of interests, skills, and relationships. When I started writing, it felt a little know-it-all-y to be giving advice, so I just turned the lens back on myself.<br/><br/>What I went through, learned about, have experienced, and then have put into action is much more accessible than me telling anyone what to do with their own lives. It’s just my story. A love story to me, meant for my 24-year-old self, written two decades too late for its intended audience, but still valid for my daughter and my friends.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with me at holly@choosebluebike.com, @choosebluebike on Instagram and Facebook, and @hollybluebike on Twitter.</p><h3><strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span></strong></h3><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p><h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3><p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p><ul>

Millennial and Xennial progressive women are often shamed into a position of believing that our own experience of individual trauma is invalid because “We have it so good that we have no right to complain.” This story is how I pushed back on that narrative, suffered openly, and transformed into a stronger, happier, and more empathetic human, embracing the matriarchal values that are the only path forward for a truly equitable, anti-racist society.As a first-generation college graduate and a newly minted East Coast elite, I would frequently look in my rear-view mirror and see all of my segregated white peers in their small white Oregon town and think: “I got out. I made it. I’m living the perfect, progressive version of Stepford Wives.” Smug AF.And then my ivory tower came crumbling down. I went from being a smug newlywed to a new mother coping with postpartum anxiety, to an entrepreneur, to a feminist, to a divorced, single, traumatized, and midlife-crisis-having adulteress. Those experiences revealed that I had everything backward. I had fucked it all up.Having the world tell you “you’re lucky to have what you have” when you feel like a shameful failure of a woman, mother, wife, and person is a painful, humiliating, and isolating experience. I know I have more than so many others. I know I am privileged and have advantages from my white skin, middle-class upbringing, and stable income through marriage. But I am still broken.If the pain is real, then the reasons behind that pain must matter, right? Pain matters.I started writing. I was typing 10,000 words a weekend. I felt myself moving through my trauma.And then George Floyd was murdered.You need to read this book if you look at your wedding photos and don’t see a Black person (thank you Robin DiAngelo for that suggestion). You need to read this book if you feel overwhelmed by life and feel shame because you are privileged and whining about it. You need to read this book if you are absolutely certain you are not racist, or that racist, or maybe just were “sheltered” in a mostly white community, or get annoyed by #blacklivesmatter when Indigenous lives matter, too. You need to read this book if you’re a college-educated, white, cis, mom who wants the world to be better and America to live up to its ideals.I Am Racist?! speaks to white women, white moms, and progressive white people who want to grapple with living their best lives, self-care, healing from trauma, and finding your highest joy while also figuring out how to do all of that self-focused work without feeling overwhelming guilt and helplessness about the larger problems in our society.Ultimately, I hope that I Am Racist?! inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
Am I building a life of joy for myself, my partner, my children?
How do I overcome shame and childhood trauma to find my purpose?
What if I royally fuck up and cheat on my husband or become a binge drinker or otherwise do some really big damage? Will I lose everything? Am I worthless? Why do I feel trapped and alone?
What is the path forward for me if I truly am ready to start self-care and realign my values?
How can I have both maximum personal joy AND be committed to social justice and anti racist practice? I mean can we indulge in all-inclusive vacations and kitchen renovations and still become allies? (Hint: Yes.)
I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing this complex dynamic will change us all for the better.I Am Racist?! And other things I knew but was too ashamed to talk about is written in Four Parts....
Part 1 is about the very real and very painful experience of the female midlife crisis, based on expert research and interviews, we talk about how therapy, self-care, coaching, and lifestyle influencers are selling us bandage solutions to real, persistent sociological problems for middle-class, college educated Millennial and Xennial moms and womxn.
Part 2 centers on how individual context - who you were raised to be as a woman, mom, professional, and “wife” confounds our progress further, creating a trap where we feel guilty and indulgent when seeking ways to heal our souls and bodies.
Part 3 is how we can meld together the high ideals of social justice - feminism, racial equality, gender equality, all the equalities - into one, more powerful perspective that gives us the grace be individually whole, brave, and happy while also fighting for what’s fundamentally the most important issue in our society today - social and racial justice. In short, we can walk and chew gum at the same time.
Part 4 is where I am today, at the dawn of ‘woke’ and not an expert, but a practitioner in a lifelong journey with my compass pointed more firmly in the right direction.
What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press of Potomac, Maryland. In order to fund the editing, printing, marketing and publication, I am offering book pre-orders:
The editing team I will work with to revise and publish the manuscript in December, 2020.
The cover design - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!
The interior layout (physical copy and ebook formats)
Copyediting
The launch & promotion efforts, like the cool video they made me!
My goal is to pre-sell 200 copies in order to publish in hardcover (vanity project), softcover, and eBook. Audiobook is on the docket, too. I have lofty goals.To my beloved community of pre-orders, you’ll be getting the Cadillac treatment. You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish (I know, don’t get overly excited about this part). Additionally, you may get:
Your name the Acknowledgements Section.
Early access to the Introduction of some additional sections of my manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.
The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover.
I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book.
Your very own rose gold pen to underline all of the important sections you’ll be referencing later at Book Club.
A personalized pack of Kleenex to wipe up all of your fragile, white woman tears.
A set of versatile drink coaster/postcards to protect your furniture while drinking heavily after reading this shit (and then for mailing to all of your other potentially racist friends.).
About Holly HarperI am a strategic marketing consultant and copywriter at the helm of her my own consulting practice, Blue Bike Communications. I work with organizations tired of feeling buried under all the marketing stuff they have to do and want to do, and they’re ready to tighten up their marketing machine so they can do what they do best: make a difference in the world. As the ad hoc marketing director, we brand, strategize, plan and implement phased change for measurable results.My writing was framed by a desire to take my personal perspectives, mostly in blog form, and translate them into a “larger picture” that addresses complex intersectional issues that are rarely addressed (racism, feminism, capitalism) in my own peer group (college educated, white, cis, married women who grew up in largely racially segregated worlds).I’ve always been curious - devouring books, asking questions, solving puzzles, learning about new places, and helping others - resulting in the development of an eclectic collection of interests, skills, and relationships. When I started writing, it felt a little know-it-all-y to be giving advice, so I just turned the lens back on myself.What I went through, learned about, have experienced, and then have put into action is much more accessible than me telling anyone what to do with their own lives. It’s just my story. A love story to me, meant for my 24-year-old self, written two decades too late for its intended audience, but still valid for my daughter and my friends.For more information you can connect with me at holly@choosebluebike.com, @choosebluebike on Instagram and Facebook, and @hollybluebike on Twitter.Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #matriarchyascendant and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.

<p>Rafael Chandler and Lamentations of the Flame Princess are teaming up to bring you <i>No Salvation for Witches</i>, a supernatural historical horror adventure for traditional tabletop role-playing games. It is an A5-size 64 page book (plus endpapers), in full color.</p>
<p>And you decide how much you want to pay for it.</p>
<p>We have an advance review! Read it <a href=""http://www.kjd-imc.org/blog/early-peek-no-salvation-for-witches/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Things You Really Need to Know:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This campaign ends on August 26th. All backers will receive a link to download the PDF version of the completed book on August 27th. The book will go to press on September 1st. If all goes well at the printer the book will ship in early/mid-October.</li>
<li>We're going for a high-quality book here. Stitched binding, proper offset printing by a printer that's been in business since 1890. Every backer meeting the final campaign average contribution will get a version of the book with a bookmark ribbon sewn in.</li>
<li>Your payment here will not include shipping charges - you pay those later. Once the book is printed you will need to 'order' the book through the <a href=""http://www.lotfp.com/store/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LotFP webstore</a>. You will receive a 100% discount coupon for the base price of the book so you pay only the shipping charges. For Economy Class shipping to anywhere in the world, we <i>estimate</i> that the cost will be right around 5€, but we cannot guarantee that postage costs will not rise (they tend to not give a lot of warning), nor do we know for sure the exact shipping weight of the book before it's printed.</li>
<li>One book per backer. Multiple contributions from a single backer will not gain that backer multiple copies of the book.</li>
<li>Rafael Chandler conceived of all the concepts in the book, did all the writing, and was the creative director. LotFP has paid for all the artwork and graphic design and other production bits (except printing) and is taking care of promotion, order fulfillment, warehousing, and all that fun stuff. Any profits will be split 50/50 between Chandler and LotFP. That said, the minimum contribution is 1€.</li>
<li>
<i>No Salvation for Witches</i> is a bit of a horrorshow. It is NSFW, after all. In the US it would be probably be considered Rated R. In Europe, it would probably get an 18+ rating.</li>
<li>Check out a <a href=""https://app.box.com/s/lgg0gxd6xe721h75cbpl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sample chapter</a> from the book!</li>
<li>If we hit the 10000€ mark, every backer meeting the final campaign average will get a bonus card with an additional encounter, including a new monster. (And <i>another</i> card if we hit 20000€!)</li>
</ul><p><strong>What's this ""Pay What You Want"" all about?</strong></p>
<p>For the past couple years, publishers and musicians and creative types have been offering digital versions of books and albums and all sorts of things on a ""Pay What You Want"" basis, letting the customer set the price based on their means and generosity and interest in the project at hand.</p>
<p>In 2013, LotFP began trying out the model for physical books at convention appearances. Sales figures skyrocketed, usually earning less money per item sold but selling many more items in the process, and earning larger total profits as a result.</p>
<p>So LotFP is bringing the Pay What You Want model for physical product to the internet and crowdfunding. We are risking one of our major releases of 2014 for the sake of an experiment in trust.</p>
<p>Because the Pay What You Want model is one based entirely on trust.</p>
<p>And we trust you.</p>

<p><strong>About <i>No Salvation for Witches</i></strong></p>
<p>England, 1620.</p>
<p>To strike a blow against the Patriarchy, six women perform a dangerous rite in an abandoned priory. Through their art, they commune with Terpsichore, Greek muse and patroness of dancers.</p>
<p>Starving demons slither across the moors; monstrous nuns shriek in the infirmary; and within the Attic, a great unraveling awaits.</p>
<p>The fate of the world rests in the hands of the player characters. Will they bring about an egalitarian utopia? Will they skulk away in the night, pockets bulging with treasure? Will they bring about the destruction of all things?</p>
<p>Will they find the Tract of Teratology, a randomly-generated creature-summoning ritual with 3.6 trillion combinations?</p>
<p>After this adventure, nothing will be the same.</p>
<p>The adventure is intended to be used with the Lamentations of the Flame Princess Weird Fantasy Role-Playing game (you can download a free, no-art, PDF of the full rules <a href=""http://www.rpgnow.com/product/115059/LotFP-Rules--Magic-Free-Version"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>), but is readily compatible with many other traditional role-playing games.</p>

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><i>What if 5000 people all just pay the minimum 1€ to reach the campaign goal? Isn't the campaign screwed?</i></p>
<p>The campaign goal of 5000€ is how much LotFP was prepared to spend out of pocket to print the book anyway and then sell in the traditional manner. Granted, that would have paid for only 2000 copies, but books get cheaper to print as more of them are printed. The fact is, we can cover the difference if the campaign is beset by a horde of cheap bastards. But you're not a horde of cheap bastards, so there's no problem.</p>
<p><i>So what is the real price of the book? How much will copies not sold through this crowdfunding campaign be sold for?</i></p>
<p>Who knows? Should we use the usual formula based on expenses to come up with the final price? Do something radical like decide that the average price gained through this crowdfunding campaign becomes the wholesale price of the book (and therefore the retail price is twice that amount)? One thing's for sure - it's a cheat on the Pay What You Want model to suggest a price. You decide what such a book is worth to you.</p>
<p><i>3.6 trillion combinations? Seriously?</i></p>
<p>Seriously! 3,600,698,572,800 to be exact, if our arithmetic is right.</p>
<p><i>Can LotFP really handle producing a quality hardcover book and process a potentially large number of orders?</i></p>

<p>We have produced a number of additional hardcover books since then. We're solid. But if you don't believe us, before the campaign started I asked in a public posting for people to give their opinions of LotFP's hardcovers without telling them why their opinions were being solicited. Their answers are <a href=""https://plus.google.com/112262093672917983853/posts/ToQWm8W3AXY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p></div>","What do YOU think is a reasonable price for a 64 page full-color hardcover adventure?
Rafael Chandler and Lamentations of the Flame Princess are teaming up to bring you No Salvation for Witches, a supernatural historical horror adventure for traditional tabletop role-playing games. It is an A5-size 64 page book (plus endpapers), in full color.
And you decide how much you want to pay for it.
We have an advance review! Read it here!
Things You Really Need to Know:

This campaign ends on August 26th. All backers will receive a link to download the PDF version of the completed book on August 27th. The book will go to press on September 1st. If all goes well at the printer the book will ship in early/mid-October.
We're going for a high-quality book here. Stitched binding, proper offset printing by a printer that's been in business since 1890. Every backer meeting the final campaign average contribution will get a version of the book with a bookmark ribbon sewn in.
Your payment here will not include shipping charges - you pay those later. Once the book is printed you will need to 'order' the book through the LotFP webstore. You will receive a 100% discount coupon for the base price of the book so you pay only the shipping charges. For Economy Class shipping to anywhere in the world, we estimate that the cost will be right around 5€, but we cannot guarantee that postage costs will not rise (they tend to not give a lot of warning), nor do we know for sure the exact shipping weight of the book before it's printed.
One book per backer. Multiple contributions from a single backer will not gain that backer multiple copies of the book.
Rafael Chandler conceived of all the concepts in the book, did all the writing, and was the creative director. LotFP has paid for all the artwork and graphic design and other production bits (except printing) and is taking care of promotion, order fulfillment, warehousing, and all that fun stuff. Any profits will be split 50/50 between Chandler and LotFP. That said, the minimum contribution is 1€.

No Salvation for Witches is a bit of a horrorshow. It is NSFW, after all. In the US it would be probably be considered Rated R. In Europe, it would probably get an 18+ rating.
Check out a sample chapter from the book!
If we hit the 10000€ mark, every backer meeting the final campaign average will get a bonus card with an additional encounter, including a new monster. (And another card if we hit 20000€!)
What's this ""Pay What You Want"" all about?
For the past couple years, publishers and musicians and creative types have been offering digital versions of books and albums and all sorts of things on a ""Pay What You Want"" basis, letting the customer set the price based on their means and generosity and interest in the project at hand.
In 2013, LotFP began trying out the model for physical books at convention appearances. Sales figures skyrocketed, usually earning less money per item sold but selling many more items in the process, and earning larger total profits as a result.
So LotFP is bringing the Pay What You Want model for physical product to the internet and crowdfunding. We are risking one of our major releases of 2014 for the sake of an experiment in trust.
Because the Pay What You Want model is one based entirely on trust.
And we trust you.



About No Salvation for Witches
England, 1620.
To strike a blow against the Patriarchy, six women perform a dangerous rite in an abandoned priory. Through their art, they commune with Terpsichore, Greek muse and patroness of dancers.
Starving demons slither across the moors; monstrous nuns shriek in the infirmary; and within the Attic, a great unraveling awaits.
The fate of the world rests in the hands of the player characters. Will they bring about an egalitarian utopia? Will they skulk away in the night, pockets bulging with treasure? Will they bring about the destruction of all things?
Will they find the Tract of Teratology, a randomly-generated creature-summoning ritual with 3.6 trillion combinations?
After this adventure, nothing will be the same.
The adventure is intended to be used with the Lamentations of the Flame Princess Weird Fantasy Role-Playing game (you can download a free, no-art, PDF of the full rules here), but is readily compatible with many other traditional role-playing games.

My name is Virginia Davis, and I am a Head Start Teacher, a poet, creative writer,
advocate for literacy, and an aspiring novelist. Since I was a teenage girl, I
have been strongly captivated by creative writing. I have absolutely fallen in
love with composing poetry, short stories, long stories, prose etc…For me,
writing is a mental vacation, a pain reliever, and everything that<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""> l need to survive.</span></p>
<p>I have always had a strong desire to one day make a
positive impact on the lives of others through my own creative literature. A few
months ago, the plot of a children’s novel dropped on my heart, almost out
of nowhere. Before I had even finished writing the story, I felt assured that
it was going to positively affect the lives of many young boys and girls who
may be suffering from low self-esteem, self-doubt, or hopelessness.   </p>
<p>Unfortunately, in today’s society, we have cultivated a
stern belief of what is beautiful and what is not. We have adopted an unfair
reasoning of what and who is acceptable, and who and what is not. Regrettably,
there are a multitude of young women, men, boys, and girls who are affected by
the narrow-mindedness of our beliefs, and view themselves as inadequate or inferior.
Growing up, I too, had these painful thoughts and beliefs about myself, and was
often hurt by the words and actions of others toward me. </p>
<p><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p>This compelling children’s story is about a young girl who
is excited to start her first day at a new school. However, once she enters her new classroom, she finds herself constantly being teased by her classmates because of
her darker skin.  Her peers will not play with or even sit by her; they
simply call her mean names and proceed to bully her.  The young girl quickly
develops low self-esteem and wishes that she were lighter, so that she could
have friends and wouldn't be made fun of.  The young girl grows to resent herself
and her dark skin, and begins to hate going to school. Every day, someone
reminds her that she is not pretty or worthy to be friends with because she is
dark-skinned.</p>
<p>However, with the help of some very
important people in her life,  at a young age, she  embraces her dark skin and realizes that her
black is just as beautiful as anyone else’s.</p>
<p><b>Why I wrote the book:</b></p>
<p> I wrote this story based off of my own real-life
experience of dealing with low self-esteem as a young girl and as an adult. As
a child, I was teased for being dark-skinned, and eventually I began to dislike
myself and my skin color as well. 
However, I overcame my low self-esteem and grew to love everything about
myself, including the color of my skin. It is my belief that this book will
teach another young child how to overcome the same obstacles that I
eventually overcame.</p>
<p> I strongly believe that this story will greatly
impact many of our troubled youth who feel that there is no one who cares for
them and who can relate to their pain. I deeply yearn to reach out to that hurt
child who feels rejected by their peers, family members, associates, and
society as a whole; I feel compelled to touch the heart of the pained young
person who thinks that they are inadequate and does not believe in himself. By
reading this book, many of our youth will acquire a stronger and higher value
of themselves, and they will gain a confidence that will be invaluable to
them throughout the course of their lifetimes.  It is my very strong belief that this is more than a
children’s book on the horizon; it is a touching story and movement that will
evoke positive change in the lives of many.</p>

My name is Virginia Davis, and I am a Head Start Teacher, a poet, creative writer,
advocate for literacy, and an aspiring novelist. Since I was a teenage girl, I
have been strongly captivated by creative writing. I have absolutely fallen in
love with composing poetry, short stories, long stories, prose etc…For me,
writing is a mental vacation, a pain reliever, and everything that l need to survive.
I have always had a strong desire to one day make a
positive impact on the lives of others through my own creative literature. A few
months ago, the plot of a children’s novel dropped on my heart, almost out
of nowhere. Before I had even finished writing the story, I felt assured that
it was going to positively affect the lives of many young boys and girls who
may be suffering from low self-esteem, self-doubt, or hopelessness.   
Unfortunately, in today’s society, we have cultivated a
stern belief of what is beautiful and what is not. We have adopted an unfair
reasoning of what and who is acceptable, and who and what is not. Regrettably,
there are a multitude of young women, men, boys, and girls who are affected by
the narrow-mindedness of our beliefs, and view themselves as inadequate or inferior.
Growing up, I too, had these painful thoughts and beliefs about myself, and was
often hurt by the words and actions of others toward me. 
About the Book:
This compelling children’s story is about a young girl who
is excited to start her first day at a new school. However, once she enters her new classroom, she finds herself constantly being teased by her classmates because of
her darker skin.  Her peers will not play with or even sit by her; they
simply call her mean names and proceed to bully her.  The young girl quickly
develops low self-esteem and wishes that she were lighter, so that she could
have friends and wouldn't be made fun of.  The young girl grows to resent herself
and her dark skin, and begins to hate going to school. Every day, someone
reminds her that she is not pretty or worthy to be friends with because she is
dark-skinned.
However, with the help of some very
important people in her life,  at a young age, she  embraces her dark skin and realizes that her
black is just as beautiful as anyone else’s.
Why I wrote the book:
 I wrote this story based off of my own real-life
experience of dealing with low self-esteem as a young girl and as an adult. As
a child, I was teased for being dark-skinned, and eventually I began to dislike
myself and my skin color as well. 
However, I overcame my low self-esteem and grew to love everything about
myself, including the color of my skin. It is my belief that this book will
teach another young child how to overcome the same obstacles that I
eventually overcame.
 I strongly believe that this story will greatly
impact many of our troubled youth who feel that there is no one who cares for
them and who can relate to their pain. I deeply yearn to reach out to that hurt
child who feels rejected by their peers, family members, associates, and
society as a whole; I feel compelled to touch the heart of the pained young
person who thinks that they are inadequate and does not believe in himself. By
reading this book, many of our youth will acquire a stronger and higher value
of themselves, and they will gain a confidence that will be invaluable to
them throughout the course of their lifetimes.  It is my very strong belief that this is more than a
children’s book on the horizon; it is a touching story and movement that will
evoke positive change in the lives of many.
