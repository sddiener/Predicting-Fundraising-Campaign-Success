<h3>About ME:</h3>
<p>I am Srinu Pandranki, 26 years young writer and aspirant Director in Telugu Film Industry. A Bachelor of commerce, I pursued my childhood passion for films, and have made more than ten short films and two music videos. My Short movies have been nominated for a number of international film festivals.</p>
<p>After enjoying an overwhelming response to my critically acclaimed screenplay “<span>X²</span>”, I decided to rewrite it into a novel, my first. I currently live in Hyderabad and am looking forward to my debut Telugu feature film.</p>
<p>You can know more about me at <a href=""http://www.srinuthedirector.in"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.srinuthedirector.in</a>.</p>
<h3>About <span>X²</span>:</h3>
<p>'<span>X²</span>' has been the most compelling story that I have been dying to tell. Hence, not waiting for it to be filmed, I wanted it to be published as a novel. It is 'one-of-its-kind' and I can assure you that it  is simply unputdownable. </p>
<p>Short Synopsis of my novel:</p>
<p>""A young student. An India-born housewife. A french tourist. Three women, three violent murders. Are they related? The Rusty PAPD detective Kevin Holmes and India-born homicide investigator Shreya Dutt find themselves running a race against time to solve the mysterious X Square connection, set in the background of the university town of Palo Alto.""</p>
<p>Thanks to the truly global nature of the world, I myself being in India wrote a novel set in Palo Alto, California, US. And I tell you, once you read my novel you would be shocked at the amount of detailing done that it would be hard to beleive that I have never been there. </p>
<h3>About the campaign:</h3>
<p>My novel is ready. Got a publisher. The date, 25th June is set for its release. Here comes the hardest part: ""Marketing and promoting it"".</p>
<p>Whatever you do, once your book is out, no one would buy it, unless they have heard about it. There are many books out there. Why should they buy mine? Yes, because mine is good. But they wouldn't know them until I tell them. To get them hear about the book, there are some things I have planned. Like the trailer above. </p>
<p>For a part of audience that would be enough. But there are more people out there. Waiting to hear about this. Who are going to love it once they read. Being a novel that has global appeal, I need to reach out to people across the globe and let them hear about my work. And to reach out to them I need your help. </p>
<p>I have already spent $3000 for the trailer, for hiring editors to improve the quality of the book, the perk expenses and book launch event that's going to happen soon. You can say that I have spent all I have to shape up the book.</p>
<p>And to sell it I am planning to air the trailer in T.V. and screen in theaters. Also planning to run an internet campaign by placing ads about the novel across the globe. Planning to design posters and place ads in newspapers to get some more attention. For all these plans to materialize I will require $5000 more. </p>
<h3>About the Impact:</h3>
<p>X² is not just a mystery novel. It has an inherent touch of humanity in it. It subconsciously tries to inject the idea of how cruel this world could be and how important it is to keep our emotions in check. We, the people of this world, are surrounded by all kinds of intelligence, human and artifcial. But we are lacking Emotional Intelligence. We are achieving many things in day to day life. But keep losing the basic ingredients of empathy towards one another, that differentiates beasts from humans. That's why this novel is so important. And I want more and more people to read it. </p>

</div><div></div><h3>Why is it so important?<br/>
</h3><div>
<h3></h3> <p>''Redroo's Cotton Adventure'' is a children book that is not only fun and adventurous, it contributes to the awareness of children about the origin of products we use in daily life!<br/></p>
<p>Now a days we often notice that children ( and sometimes even adults) forget or simply don't know where products or certain food is coming from. <br/></p>
<p>How many children are aware where the production process of their favorite shirt starts? <br/></p>
<p>We loose contact with nature, lack of appreciation and interest. Which affects farming and we'll continue the ''fast'' and modern lifestyle we are living. But... with this book we can contribute the opposite! It'll teach your child that their favorite shirt is coming from the cotton plant, even so their mattress and much more. And it makes children aware that hard work is necessary to make these products.<br/></p>
<p>There isn't any adventurous children book like this out there and for this reason we think this book has to exist! For their fun and their future!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Estimated time frame<br/>
</h3> <p>As soon as we reached the goal with Crowdfunding we will start to publish Redroo's Cotton Adventure. Below we will show you a rough time frame to give you a transparent insight in this project.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446262564/qb7lazu1rfwzm6st1k4i.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 598.372px; height: 166px;""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We are going to self publish this book, mainly because it is faster and to lower the costs. Since Ali is a professional book publisher he knows the ways and the high quality we are expecting for this book.</span><br/></p>
<p>The illustrator is working hard to finish the illustrations before the end of December.</p>
<p>At this stage we have contacted the printing house already. Shortly after we'll receive the last illustrations, Ali will finish the complete lay-out of the book. Thereafter we'll place the order at the printing house. From that moment we'll expect to receive the copies at the end of January 2016. <br/></p>
<p>As soon as we'll receive the books, we'll start with sending them to the ones who are rewarded for it. We are expecting to have the books delivered before the 2nd week of February 2016.</p>
<p><b>Challenges and Risks</b><br/> </p>
<p>The challenges we are facing within this project is mainly time management. <br/></p>
<p>We are relying on transport. Transport from the printing house to us and transport from us to you. To lower the risk of delay, we will make good agreements about sending and posting. <br/></p>
<p>Besides that we are relying on the promised printing time from the printing house. We aren't expecting the printing time would change much consider the contacts we have made so far. When we are placing the order we will make good agreements about expected printing and delivery times.</p>
<p>Any delays of post companies we have to keep in mind, but there isn't much we can prevent about that.<br/></p>
<p>We are professionals and are fully committed to the project, what makes us eager to strive to get the book delivered within the above time frame. We will stay in full communication with each and every one of you about the production and delivery of Redroo's Cotton Adventure and the other perks.</p>

What we need
To publish ''Redroo's Cotton Adventure'' we need your help. Below an overview of the estimated costs from printing till you'll have this book in your hands. With the raise of this money we are only covering expenses, we are not counting on any profit! We would like to share our experience with children and experience this adventure ourself.
If as many people as possible contribute only a small amount, together we are able to realize and get this wonderful book published.What you get
First of all our gratitude! Thanks to you we got ''Redroo's Cotton Adventure'' into your child's hand or at their schools.But we would like to give you more then that!We made unique and excited perks for every amount contributed. So, you are not only helping with publishing this book, but you'll get something unique in return!Look at the perk list on the right side of this page and pick the one you like.
Why is it so important?

 ''Redroo's Cotton Adventure'' is a children book that is not only fun and adventurous, it contributes to the awareness of children about the origin of products we use in daily life!
Now a days we often notice that children ( and sometimes even adults) forget or simply don't know where products or certain food is coming from. 
How many children are aware where the production process of their favorite shirt starts? 
We loose contact with nature, lack of appreciation and interest. Which affects farming and we'll continue the ''fast'' and modern lifestyle we are living. But... with this book we can contribute the opposite! It'll teach your child that their favorite shirt is coming from the cotton plant, even so their mattress and much more. And it makes children aware that hard work is necessary to make these products.
There isn't any adventurous children book like this out there and for this reason we think this book has to exist! For their fun and their future!
  Estimated time frame
 As soon as we reached the goal with Crowdfunding we will start to publish Redroo's Cotton Adventure. Below we will show you a rough time frame to give you a transparent insight in this project.


We are going to self publish this book, mainly because it is faster and to lower the costs. Since Ali is a professional book publisher he knows the ways and the high quality we are expecting for this book.
The illustrator is working hard to finish the illustrations before the end of December.
At this stage we have contacted the printing house already. Shortly after we'll receive the last illustrations, Ali will finish the complete lay-out of the book. Thereafter we'll place the order at the printing house. From that moment we'll expect to receive the copies at the end of January 2016. 
As soon as we'll receive the books, we'll start with sending them to the ones who are rewarded for it. We are expecting to have the books delivered before the 2nd week of February 2016.
Challenges and Risks 
The challenges we are facing within this project is mainly time management. 
We are relying on transport. Transport from the printing house to us and transport from us to you. To lower the risk of delay, we will make good agreements about sending and posting. 
Besides that we are relying on the promised printing time from the printing house. We aren't expecting the printing time would change much consider the contacts we have made so far. When we are placing the order we will make good agreements about expected printing and delivery times.
Any delays of post companies we have to keep in mind, but there isn't much we can prevent about that.
We are professionals and are fully committed to the project, what makes us eager to strive to get the book delivered within the above time frame. We will stay in full communication with each and every one of you about the production and delivery of Redroo's Cotton Adventure and the other perks.
Other ways you can help
Some people would like to help in an other way such as contributing any other amount, having a workshop and so on. We are happy and appreciate any kind of help, so please feel free to contact us on this email: madelon.schtn@gmail.comAnd some other people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Spread the word as much as you can, to your friends, schools, libraries etc. The more people know about ''Redroo's Cotton Adventure'' the more chance we have to succeed in publishing this book. So please share the link of this project by email, Facebook or any other social media.Thank you for your trust, together let's make this book your child's new favorite!",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Will Sally save her home?  Will her friends and life as she knows it survive?  And more importantly, how can a little snake save an entire forest?</p>
</div><div> <p></p>
<h3>Why did you write the book?</h3>
<p>I wish I had an interesting answer, but I wrote it because I love to write, and have since I was a child. And I kept remembering my mother saying ""Write a children's book!"" I had been in the teaching field for so many years, but I never had the interest in writing a book for children, until I returned to teaching after leaving for close to a decade.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who are your favorite authors?</h3>
<p>I don't know that I have a favourite author, but I am drawn to a few. Sidney Sheldon's earlier works. I love P.D. James's settings, and her inspector. Anne Rice and her interesting take on vampires. And Dean Koontz. You never know what you're going to get with him, but you can be sure it will take you to a world you can almost believe to be real.</p>
<h3>What was your inspiration for the book?</h3>
<p>I've thought about this for a while. I originally wrote Sally for my nieces. Living far from them, I told it to my children at work and was disappointed when only one of them remained for the entire story. I went to a writing seminar and learned a novel needs risk and conflict. I was certain my book was good and left that seminar quite upset. Then I changed Sally. And because of the seminar (Thanks Brian Henry!) I removed some characters, added several others and re-told it to my children. They were cheering for Sally, rooting for the bad guy (some of them), and kept asking me to read one more chapter. That told me I had something.</p>
<h3>What books did you love as a child?</h3>
<p>There were several. Charlotte's Web: it was very sad when Wilbur said goodbye to Charlotte's children. That scene always brought tears to my eyes. 101 Dalmatians: I read this book so many times I knew the first few pages word for word. Nancy Drew of course. I would have to say my absolute favourite was Anne of Green Gables. The imagery, hopefulness and beauty in 'the lake of shining waters' or 'lover's lane'; I can see those scenes as vividly as if I were standing there myself.</p>
<h3>Why a snake? Most people are afraid of snakes since they're not exactly the cutest animals.</h3>
<p>Cute is subjective. And to be honest, when I first started thinking about Sally, I did not like snakes! I would literally run away screaming if I saw one. I once found a den of them under the leaves on a hike with my husband. I jumped onto a bench and almost made him carry me back to the van.<br/><br/>Now, after forcing myself to hold one and marveling at its uniqueness, I look for any and every opportunity to appreciate this under-appreciated reptile. <br/><br/>They really are quite amazing. And so much softer and smoother than human skin! Ask yourself, Why are you afraid of snakes? Did one slither up your leg? Hurt you? Hunt you down and corner you? Probably not. Unfortunately movies have demonized so many creatures unnecessarily, such as snakes, spiders and sharks. I won't be someone who contributes to this. And yes, I do know Monty is a shark but there is more to him as readers will learn!</p>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>I hope to have the opportunity to travel to schools, day cares, and libraries and inspire children to dream, believe in magic, learn about wildlife, and appreciate Mother Nature. I can still hear my day care children yelling ""Miss Michelle, look, a turkey vulture!"" They were fascinated and that is what I want to do, expose children to our fascinating world. I have to say that recently one of my husband and my favourite hiking spots, Mountsberg Conservation area, had Turkey vulture awareness day and one of my former children was featured due to his love of the raptor, wearing a t-shirt he made! I was so proud to know something I taught made such an impact.<br/>And of course, finish the second Sally the Snake!</p>
<h3>What do you plan to do with the funds you raise?</h3>
<p>The money raised will be used for editing, formatting the e-book and print books, proofreading, production co-ordination and marketing, as well as hiring the illustrator.</p>
<h3>Thank you for your time and letting the public get to know you.</h3>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity. I hope everyone enjoys Sally! She'll be back!</p>

<h3>My Story... </h3>
<p>It has been many years since I first started dreaming about writing and publishing my own cookbook. I am a lover of good food, and even more so, true health. It was during my healing journey with Crohn's disease and SIBO that I got really motivated to put this book together. I found that in the spectrum of literature written about holistic healing, there are few pieces written by people who have actually experienced major illnesses, and those that were, made a much bigger impact on me. I am at a point in my healing journey where I feel ready and super excited to offer my accumulation of knowledge and experience to those who really need it. My cookbook will include not just delicious healthy recipes for every kind of body, but stories of inspiration and pain, triumph and failure, and lots of beautiful and mouth watering pictures. </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>I am being offered an opportunity through my program -- at The Institute for Integrative Nutrition -- to be guided throughout the process of writing and self-publishing, but I'll need some help.</p>
<p>The tuition for the program is $995. It is a 6 month program, and by the end of it, I will have my book completely done! Wow, what a concept! To thank you for your support, I will send you a copy of my cookbook. Maybe even signed by yours truly ;) </p>
<h3>Many Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>A poet, a priest, a teacher, and a receptionist walk into a bar........<br/><br/>A story about growing up, and finding true friends when you need it most and expect it least. <br/><br/><em>Young and Lovely</em> is the true story of four students who changed each others' lives. This book is the result of a chaotic two-year journey. It is about relationships and life; finding ourselves and each other. More importantly, Young and Lovely is a story that simply must be told, because it is so very extraordinary. <br/><br/><em>Young and Lovely</em> is about extraordinary people, who overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles because they came together. It's about perseverance, acceptance and hope.<br/><br/>You'll laugh. You'll cry. You might spill your drink on it, but you'll want to read it again and again. <br/><br/>And this is where my own journey begins. I need your help. My aim is to chronicle the ups, the downs, the peaks and valleys that brought four strangers together....because they were meant to find each other. My aim is to share this story with the world.<br/><br/>This book has been in the back of my mind since I met these amazing people and I have officially been writing this story since March of 2012. Until very recently, the majority of the book has been scribbled furiously by hand. Old school, I know. Most of the research for it was done unintentionally ~ naturally ~organically and comes as a result of living together as friends, sharing, growing, and supporting each other. <br/><br/>This book has become one of my passions, and in order to finish it, I must travel to Nice, France where the story of these past two years really begins, and so should end.<br/><br/>And so, now I look to you for your support. I need your help to move this project forward - to write a story that must be told - my story- our stories. <br/><br/>My plan, with your financial and moral support, is to relocate to Europe for approximately three months so that I can understand the people, places and things that have shaped a life. A worldview. And a best friend. (Awww!) The story simply won't make sense, and won't be finished, until I get to France. And that's where you can help! I am attempting to raise the funds necessary to realize my dreams. To do this, I need your help.<br/><br/>You may say to me......”Let me get this straight...you're going to take my money and go on a trip with your friends? “<br/><br/>And it's true, with your help I will be overseas with two of my favourite people in the world. (Also two of my main characters!) But in addition to having (another) truly incredible adventure, I will be writing, creating, learning, growing, and realizing my lifelong dream of having a story so powerful, and so intensely relatable, that it must be shared. <br/><br/>This is a story about people who faced their demons, and found their strength.<br/><br/>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br/><br/>I am a soon-to-be-official graduate of King's University College in London, Canada My degree is in History, Philosophy and Religious Studies, which, in addition to making me extremely well-educated, makes me great fun at dinner parties and awkward situations.  I have been a writer my entire life, and with your help I will be able to finish and publish my first novel! <br/><br/>Throughout university, I volunteered with international students, which helped to shape my conviction that billions of people in the world have fascinating stories that need to be shared by the people who appreciate them. I also believe that passionate, committed, and clever people must realize their natural gifts in order to help make positive changes in the world. (For me, this is not a beauty pageant answer, but a philosophy of living with intention.) <br/><br/>The is a story for anyone who has ever been judged unfairly, and treated unjustly solely as a result of misperception, stigma, and fear. Simply because they are different. Simply because they are themselves. Because I have faced such challenges in my own life, I feel compelled, and even convicted, to share with the world this story of strong, powerful people coming together to change, heal and grow.   <br/><br/>My PROMISES<br/><br/><br/>I promise I will update ~ Before Nice ~ In Nice ~ After Nice the the progress on my book. Every step of the publishing process. Pictures, Facebook and blog posts, Clever Tweets. Videos...if I can figure out how to make a video (Please be patient, I'm a Historian) </p>
<p>I am extremely thankful for your support, and believe that creative projects rely on collaboration, sharing, and openness. Every dollar I raise will directly contribute to finishing my book and making it a success! </p>
<p>Because I believe that the greatest art saves the world, I also commit to spending at least 100 hours volunteering in the communities I visit while abroad.I have put together a perks package that reflects my charming and unapologetic idealism. This is where things get interesting. </p>
<p>Each one of my supporters will receive a chance (or chances) to vote to decide where I volunteer. Pick a cause that is meaningful and important to you. For instance, if you want my volunteer work to support cancer research, I will gladly serve at a fundraising walk.. If literacy is your passion, I will find a program that teaches children in English. Or even in French if you really want to challenge me. <br/><br/>Similarly, if you prefer that I teach an inner-city kid how to hang-glide, I suppose I'll have to learn how to hang-glide. And pray. I would have to practice that, too. No matter what you decide, there will be journal entries, and possibly hilarious pictures, for you to see. I appreciate the opportunity to pursue my dreams and passions, and would like to use this trip to make an absolutely positive impact on the world! And because the volunteering will be such a special part of my trip, it will inevitably be featured in my book! So life determines art. In so many ways. </p>
<p><em>For your $5.00 contribution, you will receive</em> 1 chance to vote to determine where I do my volunteer service while in France. As well as thanks on Facebook and Twitter. </p>
<p><em>For your $10.00 contribution you will receive</em> 2 votes to determine where I do my volunteer service, thanks on Facebook and Twitter, and I will plant a flower in your honour. And next year there will be pictures! Of Your flowers. You can take the credit! I won't tell.  </p>

<p> </p></div>","A poet, a priest, a teacher, and a receptionist walk into a bar........A story about growing up, and finding true friends when you need it most and expect it least. Young and Lovely is the true story of four students who changed each others' lives. This book is the result of a chaotic two-year journey. It is about relationships and life; finding ourselves and each other. More importantly, Young and Lovely is a story that simply must be told, because it is so very extraordinary. Young and Lovely is about extraordinary people, who overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles because they came together. It's about perseverance, acceptance and hope.You'll laugh. You'll cry. You might spill your drink on it, but you'll want to read it again and again. And this is where my own journey begins. I need your help. My aim is to chronicle the ups, the downs, the peaks and valleys that brought four strangers together....because they were meant to find each other. My aim is to share this story with the world.This book has been in the back of my mind since I met these amazing people and I have officially been writing this story since March of 2012. Until very recently, the majority of the book has been scribbled furiously by hand. Old school, I know. Most of the research for it was done unintentionally ~ naturally ~organically and comes as a result of living together as friends, sharing, growing, and supporting each other. This book has become one of my passions, and in order to finish it, I must travel to Nice, France where the story of these past two years really begins, and so should end.And so, now I look to you for your support. I need your help to move this project forward - to write a story that must be told - my story- our stories. My plan, with your financial and moral support, is to relocate to Europe for approximately three months so that I can understand the people, places and things that have shaped a life. A worldview. And a best friend. (Awww!) The story simply won't make sense, and won't be finished, until I get to France. And that's where you can help! I am attempting to raise the funds necessary to realize my dreams. To do this, I need your help.You may say to me......”Let me get this straight...you're going to take my money and go on a trip with your friends? “And it's true, with your help I will be overseas with two of my favourite people in the world. (Also two of my main characters!) But in addition to having (another) truly incredible adventure, I will be writing, creating, learning, growing, and realizing my lifelong dream of having a story so powerful, and so intensely relatable, that it must be shared. This is a story about people who faced their demons, and found their strength.ABOUT THE AUTHORI am a soon-to-be-official graduate of King's University College in London, Canada My degree is in History, Philosophy and Religious Studies, which, in addition to making me extremely well-educated, makes me great fun at dinner parties and awkward situations.  I have been a writer my entire life, and with your help I will be able to finish and publish my first novel! Throughout university, I volunteered with international students, which helped to shape my conviction that billions of people in the world have fascinating stories that need to be shared by the people who appreciate them. I also believe that passionate, committed, and clever people must realize their natural gifts in order to help make positive changes in the world. (For me, this is not a beauty pageant answer, but a philosophy of living with intention.) The is a story for anyone who has ever been judged unfairly, and treated unjustly solely as a result of misperception, stigma, and fear. Simply because they are different. Simply because they are themselves. Because I have faced such challenges in my own life, I feel compelled, and even convicted, to share with the world this story of strong, powerful people coming together to change, heal and grow.   My PROMISESI promise I will update ~ Before Nice ~ In Nice ~ After Nice the the progress on my book. Every step of the publishing process. Pictures, Facebook and blog posts, Clever Tweets. Videos...if I can figure out how to make a video (Please be patient, I'm a Historian) 
I am extremely thankful for your support, and believe that creative projects rely on collaboration, sharing, and openness. Every dollar I raise will directly contribute to finishing my book and making it a success! 
Because I believe that the greatest art saves the world, I also commit to spending at least 100 hours volunteering in the communities I visit while abroad.I have put together a perks package that reflects my charming and unapologetic idealism. This is where things get interesting. 
Each one of my supporters will receive a chance (or chances) to vote to decide where I volunteer. Pick a cause that is meaningful and important to you. For instance, if you want my volunteer work to support cancer research, I will gladly serve at a fundraising walk.. If literacy is your passion, I will find a program that teaches children in English. Or even in French if you really want to challenge me. Similarly, if you prefer that I teach an inner-city kid how to hang-glide, I suppose I'll have to learn how to hang-glide. And pray. I would have to practice that, too. No matter what you decide, there will be journal entries, and possibly hilarious pictures, for you to see. I appreciate the opportunity to pursue my dreams and passions, and would like to use this trip to make an absolutely positive impact on the world! And because the volunteering will be such a special part of my trip, it will inevitably be featured in my book! So life determines art. In so many ways. 
For your $5.00 contribution, you will receive 1 chance to vote to determine where I do my volunteer service while in France. As well as thanks on Facebook and Twitter. 
For your $10.00 contribution you will receive 2 votes to determine where I do my volunteer service, thanks on Facebook and Twitter, and I will plant a flower in your honour. And next year there will be pictures! Of Your flowers. You can take the credit! I won't tell.  
For your 25.00 contribution, you will receive 5 votes to determine where I do my volunteer service, thanks on Facebook and Twitter, a flower planted in your honour, and donation to food banks in Ontario as a way of expressing my appreciation, and giving back to the local community!
For your 50.00 contribution, you will receive 10 votes to determine where I volunteer,  Thanks on Facebook and Twitter, a flower planted and a food bank donation made in your honour, plus a postcard from me sent when I am overseas.
For your 100 dollar contribution, you will receive 20 votes to determine where I volunteer, thanks on Facebook and Twitter, a flower planted and a food bank donation in your honour, a post-card, and a letter. A real letter. The kind that people used to write all the time. The kind that comes in the mail!
For your 250 dollar contribution, you will receive 50 votes to determine the type of volunteer service I complete, thanks on Facebook and Twitter, a flower planted and a food bank donation made in your honour, a post card, a letter, and official recognition as a sponsor of this campaign on the main page. You will be immortalized. 
For your 500 dollar contribution, you will receive 100 votes to determine how I volunteer, a flower planted and a food bank donation made in your honour, a post-card, a letter, recognition as an official sponsor on the campaign page, and acknowledgements, by name, in the book when it is published! And I'll even make you a character. With a speaking part, and everything!

<p><strong>My Dream</strong></p>
<p>My dream is write books and stories that will entertain the masses for generations to come. I want to dedicate my life to developing characters people can’t live without and doing all that I can to help other so the same, but first…</p>
<p>I’d like to do an overhaul on my first book and re-present it to the public and complete its sequel. I am currently working with my artist on new images and have enhanced the detail and quality of the text. If I can get people interested in the first book and create a buzz about its sequel, I should be able to start earning enough money on my own to fund another two installments of this series.</p>
<p>To learn everything you could possibly want to know about the series without actually reading the books, visit these following free sites: <a href=""http://40daysandnightsofeternalcurse.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://40daysandnightsofeternalcurse.blogspot.com/</a>,</p>

<p><strong>My Goal</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to raise $3,000. I know this seems like a lot to ask for, but I have my reasons for choosing this amount and have faith that the right provision will arrive. This amount is only half of what I truly need, but I have to start somewhere. I also chose this amount because I’m considering the fact that this service isn’t completely free, though it is quite remarkable and ingenious. (200 people giving $15 could do this easily)</p>
<p><strong>My Plan</strong></p>
<p>Publication: First, I need to have my book professionally edited and published, so that it can shine next to all the other published works currently available to the public. Editing and publication includes: formatting, printing, binding, copyright registration, ISBN registration, online and retail sales registration and so on.</p>
<p>Marketing: Next, my book needs to be marketed in a way that helps create a buzz about it and establishes it as legitimate and worthy of purchase. For this, I’m seeking a professional critique from established news outlets and several blogs, and I’m seeking an ad campaign from AuthorBuzz.com. For the review and or marketing to take place, I will need to pay for and complete submission forms, and provide completed galleys of my work.</p>
<p>Distribution: Lastly, I hope to develop a new fan base and distribution arena for my series. If and when, the online, one-to-one, and indie sales of my books pick up, I hope to register them for a national book fair, allowing retail establishments to stock their shelves with my works.</p>

<h4>Excerpt from chapter one, Racing to Red Rock River</h4>
<p>Every morning, the Sun awoke and began his slow ascent over the great continent of Ka'lanna, banishing the night sky and the darkness that had unleashed themselves across the land in his absence. As the Sun's golden beams fanned from the eastern horizon, all forms of life began to stir and awaken from their slumbers. Sunlight began to warm the villages of humankind, and the people of the world faced the new day with the warmth of their star shining down upon them. Once the Sun made his way halfway through the sky above Ka'lanna, he would slow his daily journey, coming almost to a stop. This happened where, the rolling hills, grassy plains, and woodlands all danced in harmony; bathing in the warmth and the light.<br/><br/>The Goodwind tribe lived at the mystic intersection where all the terrains blended together and became one land. They were the only humans who still honored the blessed ways of Sehebre. When the sun reached the outskirts of their village most of them still slept, but the early risers awaited each morning silently in anticipation, for the ones who guarded the nighttime fires had recently surrendered to slumber. The early risers stood frozen in a meditative stance, almost as if they had removed themselves from time. In their minds they imagined themselves as beaming balls of light, sending their love to everyone they cared about, to everyone they hoped to protect from the plague of duality. <br/><br/>The sunbeams kissed the animals inhabiting the wood, darting along, dancing in the forest, creating light and casting out shadows. The animals marveled as the flowers instantly bloomed when touched by the powerful light. Tribe members slowly awoke from their meditative states, taking in the wonderful and fresh smells of a new day. Bright green grass shimmered as the dew of the night before evaporated, and the new day had officially begun for humans and animals alike. <br/><br/>This crisp fragrance drifted in the wind. The Sun finished passing over the rolling hills, moving up and down between all the spaces and caves, causing the last of the darkness to flee. By this time most of the other tribe members were awake and slowly beginning their day, all were waiting the magical moment when the light reached the highest point in the area, a place known as Sehebre's Finger. Once the new day's light found this point, it burst across the valley, reflecting like an immense galactic waterfall, spilling it’s warmth and brightness across the sky, igniting the entire village in a mirage of golden flames. With all his glory the Sun shined brightly over the village of the Goodwind tribe, blessing them for honoring the ways of Sehebre.<br/></p>
<h4>My Journey, The Monomyth Behind Alynia Sky</h4>
<p></p>
<p>When I was
seventeen and started creating this project, I didn't know what I was getting
myself into. I was a young man who liked Dungeons and Dragons and Heavy Metal. Writing
had become my primary coping mechanism for dealing with my mother's breast cancer.
I remember hiding in the basement for hours, listening to my favorite bands and
letting my imagination whisk me to a place I called <i>The Land of Alynia</i>. I had no idea that it would stay with me all these
years. I had no idea that my dream would eventually be to empower girls. </p>
<p>After my
mother died in January of 2001, I found my life in shambles, and I went to a
dark place. I became a negative person. I cared only about myself. I was the
only person in my circle. One woman, my godmother, held on to me. She became my
lighthouse, and over the years, she helped steer my ship back to the light.</p>
<p><i>Alynia</i> is the combination of my mother’s
and godmother’s names, with the -nia at the end in tribute to C. S. Lewis and
his works, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>.
Sky appears later. Don’t worry; I’ll tell you why. I can tell you that I adore
the way of life and the spiritual practices of indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Back to 2001—I
was in a dark place, and I imagined several characters, many of whom you’ll meet
throughout the Alynia Sky series. They needed a place to live, so I sent them
to a land called <i>Alynia</i>. I developed
cultures, tribes, and all sorts of species. They needed a plot. I created a girl
named Molly, based off my little sister. Molly’s dad had just died, and she ran
away from home and somehow ended up in Alynia. Unfortunately, for Molly, she
showed up right after all three of Alynia’s queens went missing. Then, I
started outlining and writing.</p>
<p>I spent
years working on the book, <i>Alynia: A Land
of Lost Queens</i>. I even joined the Society of Creative Anachronism to do
research. I remember that one night, I dressed in full garb and jumped in a
lake. In hindsight, it was a horrible idea. I wanted to write about a lake that
was a portal to the Moon. I had to do it! The book was my coping mechanism, but
I wasn’t ready to be healed, so the project was shelved.</p>
<p>At some point, I decided I wanted to understand why my
mother was taken from me and what happens to us when we die. I started down my
spiritual path. I read about God, Jesus, Nirvana, Buddha, and Allah. I read
every book on religion I could get my hands on. Then, I started to meditate and
participate in sweat lodges. Something else started to happen; I began to care
about others—not as much as I do today, but it was a start. My circle grew to
include friends and family.</p>
<p>By the time
2007 ended, I had traveled to many places. I had spent a summer volunteering at
the Omega Institute in upstate New York. I had graduated from the Atlanta
School of Massage. I had even become a father. That’s right—on July 28, 2007,
my life changed. My daughter was born, and she was named Alynia Sky—Alynia, to
honor my mothers, and Sky, to honor the Native American heritage from her
mother’s side of the family.</p>
<p>During
massage school, I had written a short story, <i>A Gift from an Eagle</i>, which was going to be an illustrated
children’s book. As I do with many projects, I dove right in and took it far. The
first year after Alynia was born, things between her mother and me didn’t work
out. They moved to California (don’t worry; they moved back), and I shelved my
project.</p>
<p>Again, my life fell to pieces. I was in a funk. I even
quit my job. One fateful day, I went to a bookstore where I met a woman who
inspired me to create a powerful character who could change the world. Just
like that, the woman came into my life, changed it, and disappeared. Because
I’m named after a book, <i>Ben Hur</i> (my
name is spelled differently), I decided to create a character named Alynia Sky.
It makes sense now, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Now that I
had Alynia Sky, I needed a home for her, so I sent her to the world Alynia. Because
the character was named Alynia, I decided to change the land to, Ka’lanna. Now
that Alynia had a home, she needed a storyline; in comes <i>A Gift from an Eagle</i>. I believed that it was a good start, but I
wanted an epic story, one my daughter would be proud of. I am very proud to be
Ben Herr; it is a very epic name.</p>
<p>Now,
timeline wise, we’re in fall 2009, and I had spent an entire year outlining and
writing and smashing everything together. Again, I ran into the woman from the
bookstore. She was a volunteer activist from an organization called RESULTS. She
invited me to a meeting, and because she had changed my life, I thought, why
not.</p>
<p>I was hooked
after my first meeting. I became aware of global problems and solutions. I
learned about microcredit loans. I learned that at the time, 72 million kids
weren’t going to school. These people were trying to fix it. Amazing!</p>
<p>RESULTS
taught me many skills: public speaking, making cold calls, setting up major
events, and writing letters to the editor. Several times, I even met with
elected officials or their staff. The most important thing RESULTS taught me
was empathy. Again, my circle grew. On the downside, I stopped writing. </p>
<p>In the fall
of 2010, because of some close friends I met through RESULTS, I got into collecting
art. One night, we went to Doo Gallery, and I saw a piece of art that reminded
me of Alynia Sky. I bought it, and at that moment, I knew that one day, the
artist would do the book cover.</p>
<p>I was
working hard, spending time with my daughter, and collecting art. I was content
living life. A few more years passed, and I had all but forgotten my book
series. It was in me. With the motivation of people close to me, I tried to get
it back, but nothing ever felt right.</p>
<p>This spring,
something clicked, and I woke with the thought, now or never. Since then, I
have been working nonstop. All year, all the right people have come along. Now,
you are here, in the moment when I need the most support.</p>
<p>My story is
my journey, and somewhere along the way, I created a beautiful character, Alynia Sky, who can
be a positive role model for girls.</p>
<p>It isn’t
about me or my book. It isn’t about a brand. It is about a movement. It is
about instilling our youth with positive virtues. It is about helping our
children make the right decisions down their paths of self-discovery.</p>
<p>Will you
help me fulfill my dream?</p>
<blockquote>""About half of seven-year-olds want to be president, but by the time children hit their teen years, that aspiration falls by the wayside for girls. Our appearance-focused environment may play a role in how a girl thinks about her future"" -Miss Representation</blockquote>
<h3>I would like you to meet Alynia Sky!</h3>
<p>""Alynia Sky: The Beginning and the End"" is a whimsical coming-of-age story about Alynia, a thirteen-year-old girl and member of the Goodwind Tribe. Alynia shares a natural kinship with birds, from which she learns much. Her best friend and fishing companion is a rooster who provides comic relief. Unknown to anyone, this rooster is so much more than he seems. Inspired by an orphaned songbird, Alynia neglects her studies and responsibilities to daydream of flying. <br/><br/>On the eve of her fourteenth birthday, she receives a vision to seek out Daybreak, the King of Birds, to ask him to teach her to fly. Unknown to Alynia, the vision has a much higher purpose. <br/><br/>""Alynia Sky: The Beginning and the End"" revolves around Alynia, her family, her tribespeople, and a variety of avian characters dealing with the events set in motion by an ancient race. It is the first installment in a young-adult fiction series that deals with the issues of gender equality and social justice.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Alynia Sky: Reflections</h3>
<p>In the first book, The Beginning and the End, the theme is self-discovery. Alynia Sky: Reflections, is a FREE companion guide for the book. Once we're up and running, anyone will be able to download it from the official Alynia Sky website. The Reflections guide is a chapter by chapter, breakdown of the book containing exercises, discussion topics, and fun facts about the book. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The function of Alynia Sky: Reflections is to encourage young girls to discover themselves, their dreams, and their passions. It will help them unlock their potential.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">“Invest in a girl, and she will do the rest."" </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">-The Girl Effect</span>
</blockquote>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I have identified several Subject Matter Experts; teachers, social-workers, psychologists, young-mothers, old-mothers, and even a couple of young girls. Once the book is printed, I will distribute copies to these individuals, along with a outline form for each chapter.

Every morning, the Sun awoke and began his slow ascent over the great continent of Ka'lanna, banishing the night sky and the darkness that had unleashed themselves across the land in his absence. As the Sun's golden beams fanned from the eastern horizon, all forms of life began to stir and awaken from their slumbers. Sunlight began to warm the villages of humankind, and the people of the world faced the new day with the warmth of their star shining down upon them. Once the Sun made his way halfway through the sky above Ka'lanna, he would slow his daily journey, coming almost to a stop. This happened where, the rolling hills, grassy plains, and woodlands all danced in harmony; bathing in the warmth and the light.The Goodwind tribe lived at the mystic intersection where all the terrains blended together and became one land. They were the only humans who still honored the blessed ways of Sehebre. When the sun reached the outskirts of their village most of them still slept, but the early risers awaited each morning silently in anticipation, for the ones who guarded the nighttime fires had recently surrendered to slumber. The early risers stood frozen in a meditative stance, almost as if they had removed themselves from time. In their minds they imagined themselves as beaming balls of light, sending their love to everyone they cared about, to everyone they hoped to protect from the plague of duality. The sunbeams kissed the animals inhabiting the wood, darting along, dancing in the forest, creating light and casting out shadows. The animals marveled as the flowers instantly bloomed when touched by the powerful light. Tribe members slowly awoke from their meditative states, taking in the wonderful and fresh smells of a new day. Bright green grass shimmered as the dew of the night before evaporated, and the new day had officially begun for humans and animals alike. This crisp fragrance drifted in the wind. The Sun finished passing over the rolling hills, moving up and down between all the spaces and caves, causing the last of the darkness to flee. By this time most of the other tribe members were awake and slowly beginning their day, all were waiting the magical moment when the light reached the highest point in the area, a place known as Sehebre's Finger. Once the new day's light found this point, it burst across the valley, reflecting like an immense galactic waterfall, spilling it’s warmth and brightness across the sky, igniting the entire village in a mirage of golden flames. With all his glory the Sun shined brightly over the village of the Goodwind tribe, blessing them for honoring the ways of Sehebre.
My Journey, The Monomyth Behind Alynia Sky

When I was
seventeen and started creating this project, I didn't know what I was getting
myself into. I was a young man who liked Dungeons and Dragons and Heavy Metal. Writing
had become my primary coping mechanism for dealing with my mother's breast cancer.
I remember hiding in the basement for hours, listening to my favorite bands and
letting my imagination whisk me to a place I called The Land of Alynia. I had no idea that it would stay with me all these
years. I had no idea that my dream would eventually be to empower girls. 
After my
mother died in January of 2001, I found my life in shambles, and I went to a
dark place. I became a negative person. I cared only about myself. I was the
only person in my circle. One woman, my godmother, held on to me. She became my
lighthouse, and over the years, she helped steer my ship back to the light.
Alynia is the combination of my mother’s
and godmother’s names, with the -nia at the end in tribute to C. S. Lewis and
his works, The Chronicles of Narnia.
Sky appears later. Don’t worry; I’ll tell you why. I can tell you that I adore
the way of life and the spiritual practices of indigenous peoples.
Back to 2001—I
was in a dark place, and I imagined several characters, many of whom you’ll meet
throughout the Alynia Sky series. They needed a place to live, so I sent them
to a land called Alynia. I developed
cultures, tribes, and all sorts of species. They needed a plot. I created a girl
named Molly, based off my little sister. Molly’s dad had just died, and she ran
away from home and somehow ended up in Alynia. Unfortunately, for Molly, she
showed up right after all three of Alynia’s queens went missing. Then, I
started outlining and writing.
I spent
years working on the book, Alynia: A Land
of Lost Queens. I even joined the Society of Creative Anachronism to do
research. I remember that one night, I dressed in full garb and jumped in a
lake. In hindsight, it was a horrible idea. I wanted to write about a lake that
was a portal to the Moon. I had to do it! The book was my coping mechanism, but
I wasn’t ready to be healed, so the project was shelved.
At some point, I decided I wanted to understand why my
mother was taken from me and what happens to us when we die. I started down my
spiritual path. I read about God, Jesus, Nirvana, Buddha, and Allah. I read
every book on religion I could get my hands on. Then, I started to meditate and
participate in sweat lodges. Something else started to happen; I began to care
about others—not as much as I do today, but it was a start. My circle grew to
include friends and family.
By the time
2007 ended, I had traveled to many places. I had spent a summer volunteering at
the Omega Institute in upstate New York. I had graduated from the Atlanta
School of Massage. I had even become a father. That’s right—on July 28, 2007,
my life changed. My daughter was born, and she was named Alynia Sky—Alynia, to
honor my mothers, and Sky, to honor the Native American heritage from her
mother’s side of the family.
During
massage school, I had written a short story, A Gift from an Eagle, which was going to be an illustrated
children’s book. As I do with many projects, I dove right in and took it far. The
first year after Alynia was born, things between her mother and me didn’t work
out. They moved to California (don’t worry; they moved back), and I shelved my
project.
Again, my life fell to pieces. I was in a funk. I even
quit my job. One fateful day, I went to a bookstore where I met a woman who
inspired me to create a powerful character who could change the world. Just
like that, the woman came into my life, changed it, and disappeared. Because
I’m named after a book, Ben Hur (my
name is spelled differently), I decided to create a character named Alynia Sky.
It makes sense now, doesn’t it?
Now that I
had Alynia Sky, I needed a home for her, so I sent her to the world Alynia. Because
the character was named Alynia, I decided to change the land to, Ka’lanna. Now
that Alynia had a home, she needed a storyline; in comes A Gift from an Eagle. I believed that it was a good start, but I
wanted an epic story, one my daughter would be proud of. I am very proud to be
Ben Herr; it is a very epic name.
Now,
timeline wise, we’re in fall 2009, and I had spent an entire year outlining and
writing and smashing everything together. Again, I ran into the woman from the
bookstore. She was a volunteer activist from an organization called RESULTS. She
invited me to a meeting, and because she had changed my life, I thought, why
not.
I was hooked
after my first meeting. I became aware of global problems and solutions. I
learned about microcredit loans. I learned that at the time, 72 million kids
weren’t going to school. These people were trying to fix it. Amazing!
RESULTS
taught me many skills: public speaking, making cold calls, setting up major
events, and writing letters to the editor. Several times, I even met with
elected officials or their staff. The most important thing RESULTS taught me
was empathy. Again, my circle grew. On the downside, I stopped writing. 
In the fall
of 2010, because of some close friends I met through RESULTS, I got into collecting
art. One night, we went to Doo Gallery, and I saw a piece of art that reminded
me of Alynia Sky. I bought it, and at that moment, I knew that one day, the
artist would do the book cover.
I was
working hard, spending time with my daughter, and collecting art. I was content
living life. A few more years passed, and I had all but forgotten my book
series. It was in me. With the motivation of people close to me, I tried to get
it back, but nothing ever felt right.
This spring,
something clicked, and I woke with the thought, now or never. Since then, I
have been working nonstop. All year, all the right people have come along. Now,
you are here, in the moment when I need the most support.
My story is
my journey, and somewhere along the way, I created a beautiful character, Alynia Sky, who can
be a positive role model for girls.
It isn’t
about me or my book. It isn’t about a brand. It is about a movement. It is
about instilling our youth with positive virtues. It is about helping our
children make the right decisions down their paths of self-discovery.
Will you
help me fulfill my dream?
""About half of seven-year-olds want to be president, but by the time children hit their teen years, that aspiration falls by the wayside for girls. Our appearance-focused environment may play a role in how a girl thinks about her future"" -Miss Representation
I would like you to meet Alynia Sky!
""Alynia Sky: The Beginning and the End"" is a whimsical coming-of-age story about Alynia, a thirteen-year-old girl and member of the Goodwind Tribe. Alynia shares a natural kinship with birds, from which she learns much. Her best friend and fishing companion is a rooster who provides comic relief. Unknown to anyone, this rooster is so much more than he seems. Inspired by an orphaned songbird, Alynia neglects her studies and responsibilities to daydream of flying. On the eve of her fourteenth birthday, she receives a vision to seek out Daybreak, the King of Birds, to ask him to teach her to fly. Unknown to Alynia, the vision has a much higher purpose. ""Alynia Sky: The Beginning and the End"" revolves around Alynia, her family, her tribespeople, and a variety of avian characters dealing with the events set in motion by an ancient race. It is the first installment in a young-adult fiction series that deals with the issues of gender equality and social justice.


Alynia Sky: Reflections
In the first book, The Beginning and the End, the theme is self-discovery. Alynia Sky: Reflections, is a FREE companion guide for the book. Once we're up and running, anyone will be able to download it from the official Alynia Sky website. The Reflections guide is a chapter by chapter, breakdown of the book containing exercises, discussion topics, and fun facts about the book. 
The function of Alynia Sky: Reflections is to encourage young girls to discover themselves, their dreams, and their passions. It will help them unlock their potential.

“Invest in a girl, and she will do the rest."" -The Girl Effect

I have identified several Subject Matter Experts; teachers, social-workers, psychologists, young-mothers, old-mothers, and even a couple of young girls. Once the book is printed, I will distribute copies to these individuals, along with a outline form for each chapter. Once all the forms are collected, I will compile the information, and create the Reflection Guide. I hope to have this portion of the project completed and online by February 2014.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Matthew Kowalski, or Luminosity what ever you prefer. I have been dreaming and working on visions and internal prophecies pushed forth from the active mind dreaming reality. I know hope and despair, love and hate and the very many dichotomies that I declare unities. For understanding of these things comes in a completion in a full circle a wholeistic experience that is taken in and possibly transmitted. I have been creating this work out of a need, an internal voice that keeps pushing me ever forward, and yet no matter how fast I run to the destination. It always asks more of me, to move faster to dream bigger. So dream a little dream for me and help me to make this mission a success.</p>

<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Matthew Kowalski, or Luminosity what ever you prefer. I have been dreaming and working on visions and internal prophecies pushed forth from the active mind dreaming reality. I know hope and despair, love and hate and the very many dichotomies that I declare unities. For understanding of these things comes in a completion in a full circle a wholeistic experience that is taken in and possibly transmitted. I have been creating this work out of a need, an internal voice that keeps pushing me ever forward, and yet no matter how fast I run to the destination. It always asks more of me, to move faster to dream bigger. So dream a little dream for me and help me to make this mission a success.

<h3>A colorful, funny children's book for a great cause</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Maya Zankoul, a Lebanese illustrator. Over the last few years I've published several books about life in Lebanon.</p>
<p>As you know, 2020 was a difficult year for us all, but especially for children in Lebanon. Their life was turned upside down, and basic things like feeling safe, playing with other children, and discovering their surroundings, became forbidden to them.</p>
<p>This is why I decided to publish my first children's book: ""The Story Of The Grilled Cheese Sandwich"" (قصة عروس الجبنة المحمصة)</p>
<p>The book is based on a story I tell my 3-year old daughter at dinnertime, and she loves it and finds it very funny. I'm hoping the book will bring a smile to other children her age, too! It tells the story of a little girl who traveled the world through the grilled cheese in her sandwich that kept stretching, stretching, and stretching!</p>
<p>The book's purpose is to widen the imagination of children, to help them travel outside the confines of their homes during these tough times, and to support them in dreaming for a brighter future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>I will be printing 500 hardcover copies of the children's book with a local Lebanese printing press, using high quality paper and ink. The size will be child-friendly so they can read it alone, and with their parents, too! The book can be enjoyed by children aged 1 to 6 years old.</p>
<p>The total cost of this project, including the IndieGogo additional 5% and processing fees is $1,890. You can participate in the project by purchasing any of the rewards mentioned below.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Reality Check - In Pursuit of the Right Questions</i></p>
<p><br/>My name is Carlo Mahfouz, and I am the author of <i>Reality Check - In Pursuit of the Right Questions</i>. I wrote this book because I recognized that the challenge we face in today's very uncertain world full of ambiguity and distractions from every angle is ""How to tackle what matters?"" But more importantly, how to actually see it in the first place. If we can train ourselves to ask the right questions, we can see things differently and ultimately create positive change in the world.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how you can better prepare yourself to ask the right questions. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for exploring the characteristics, mental models, mindsets, and behaviors that enable us to improve and better equip ourselves to tackle problems with the right questions. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you navigate today's world filled with uncertainty and distractions, whether it is on a personal or professional level. That will give you a structure to lean into to ground your thinking as you explore questions that matter to you the most. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about what elements we should be conscious of when asking questions, such as context, time, and energy. Dive into internal challenges to measure and deal with ambiguity, extremes, and idea ownership. Moving into communication and addressing the external challenges and setting expectations, having the right audience, and speaking the same language. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>My personal story, as an engineer, computer graphics artist, and opera singer. Leveraging different mental models from various disciplines to structure and understand what it takes to ask the right questions. </li>
<li>Ola Helland’s story of when his Dad got Alzheimer and how embracing and accepting the change, even though it was a really bad change, made him deal with it differently. Asking the right questions hinges on the understanding that everything is changing constantly and that we have to accept that. </li>
<li>Lucas Huang’s story about idea ownership. The right questions are the ones that expose ideas and challenge the ownership and disputes them fiercely to find the best solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you want to grow and challenge yourself to ask better questions.<br/><br/><i>Reality Check - In Pursuit Of The Right Questions</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators who want to look at things differently and challenge the status quo to find solutions that address what matters through asking the right questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - <i>Reality Check - In Pursuit Of The Right Questions</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-5, which define and describe the elements which we should be conscious of when asking questions. Such as accepting change and our relationship with it while recognizing the right question alongside context and energy. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 6-10, which dive into embracing ambiguity mindset, removing the filters of idea ownership, and teasing the extremes to identify the boundaries.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 11-14, which focus on communication and how to frame and set up good conversations which enable good questions and interactions. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>La nostra Storia</h3>
<p>Siamo Marilia, Andrea, Valentina,  mamme da 3 nazioni diverse, Brasile , Messico e Italia,  e con tre diversi percorsi accademici e specializzazioni.</p>
<p>Dal 2017 stiamo lavorando in questo progetto, tante piccole storie racchiuse in un albo illustrato con una bella lettura in rima per bambini di età 3-7 anni presentata in diverse lingue.</p>
<p>Questa campagna mira a far conoscere ""Paco e i suoi amici"" tramite un canale you tube per poi farlo diventare a tutti gli effetti un piccolo libro.</p>
<p>I video saranno  animati con i personaggi del libro con canzoni in diverse lingue  facili e allegre così che il bambino possa ascoltare musicalità di linguaggio differenti e passare momenti sereni durante la giornata.</p>
<p>Vogliamo fare qualcosa che vada oltre al solo libro,creando un compagno di avventure per tutte le attività che ci piacerebbe condividere con voi (tutorial, canzoni, storie) .</p>
<p>I personaggi di ""Paco e i suoi amici""  sono fatti interamente partendo da carta colorata e forbice, direttamente dalla fantasia di Marilia, ideatrice dei personaggi e del progetto.</p>

Siamo Marilia, Andrea, Valentina,  mamme da 3 nazioni diverse, Brasile , Messico e Italia,  e con tre diversi percorsi accademici e specializzazioni.
Dal 2017 stiamo lavorando in questo progetto, tante piccole storie racchiuse in un albo illustrato con una bella lettura in rima per bambini di età 3-7 anni presentata in diverse lingue.
Questa campagna mira a far conoscere ""Paco e i suoi amici"" tramite un canale you tube per poi farlo diventare a tutti gli effetti un piccolo libro.
I video saranno  animati con i personaggi del libro con canzoni in diverse lingue  facili e allegre così che il bambino possa ascoltare musicalità di linguaggio differenti e passare momenti sereni durante la giornata.
Vogliamo fare qualcosa che vada oltre al solo libro,creando un compagno di avventure per tutte le attività che ci piacerebbe condividere con voi (tutorial, canzoni, storie) .
I personaggi di ""Paco e i suoi amici""  sono fatti interamente partendo da carta colorata e forbice, direttamente dalla fantasia di Marilia, ideatrice dei personaggi e del progetto.

</h3>
<br/>My name is Will Angel and I am the author of Virtual Power. I wrote this book because we’re facing a global challenge to make humanity’s presence on this planet sustainable. Advances in energy storage and Internet of Things networking will make the global electrical grids more sustainable and resilient to the effects of climate change.<br/><br/>In <i>Virtual Power</i> you will discover how energy storage and virtual power plants are enabling more renewable energy production and increasing the resiliency of our power networks without breaking the bank. You’ll learn about the amazing work being done with renewable energy to decarbonize the electrical grid, and how those efforts are succeeding, but not succeeding fast enough without storage.<br/><br/>In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for energy technology and policy in you and help inform your personal, business, and policy decisions.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about:<ul>
<li>How Grid Scale energy storage in Australia is keeping the lights on and reducing costs.</li>
<li>The Duck Curve: how virtual power plants made out of charging electric vehicles are keeping solar energy from destroying California’s electrical grid.</li>
<li>How businesses and governments are saving billions of dollars by investing in flexibility and storage.</li>
</ul> You will love this book if you are passionate about sustainability and the environment or enjoy learning about technology.<br/><br/>Virtual Power is a non-fiction book for environmental activists and decision makers in utilities, businesses, and governments, and anyone interested in energy storage, virtual power plants, and the future of human electricity consumption.<br/> <h3><strong>The Book - Virtual Power</strong></h3> The book is written in 5 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + additional chapters. This part will cover our current situation with climate change and how this is a challenge for human energy consumption, a brief history of energy and how we got here, how we’re dependent on energy, and the ways that renewable energy gives us hope.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 5-8. This part will cover what renewables we have, how they’ll help, how they won’t be enough to fully decarbonize our grid, and how storage is the solution.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 9-13. This section will look at how the electrical grid needs to be more flexible, how energy storage helps, the ways in which demand response works and fails to work, how virtual power plants are going to be a huge part of the grid, and how the blockchain could save or destroy us.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains chapters 14-17. This portion explores the obstacles facing energy storage and virtual power plants, including an overview of how costs, regulation, social norms, and the technology itself will make it difficult to use energy storage effectively.<br/><br/>Part 5 contains chapters 18-20. This conclusion to my book looks at the future of human energy consumption and where we could be in 10 to 50 years.<br/> <h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3>
<br/><i>Virtual Power </i>will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<p>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in February 2020!</p>

<p>Noi coordinatori di Millennials Press siamo sostanzialmente ragazzi, giovani laureati e comunicatori, soprattutto curiosi e appassionati di giornalismo.

Adesso ci impegniamo a reperire informazioni e trasmetterle senza filtri, nel rispetto del lettore. Per far definitivamente decollare il nostro giornale abbiamo bisogno di voi. Banale, no? Eppure per fare del buon giornalismo online sono sufficienti investimenti contenuti ma oculati. Ci concentreremo particolarmente sullo sviluppo di una piattaforma sempre più responsive e user-friendly.

<p>A questo punto Indiegogo ci chiede di spiegarvi perché il nostro progetto è importante per il mondo. Il mondo. Sì, beh, è vero anche che abbiamo un sito gemello negli States, a Washington, ma per ora i nostri pur ambiziosi obiettivi sono circoscritti al rendere l'Italia un paese migliore. Partendo dal basso. E se è vero come è vero che un Paese è reso grande dalle persone che vi abitano, abbiamo bisogno di fare un salto di qualità nell'informazione e rendere il servizio pubblico a cui sono chiamati i giornalisti. A cui siamo chiamati noi giornalisti. Eppure, c'è qualcosa che non va. Ve lo spieghiamo prendendo a prestito uno stralcio della mission pubblicata su millennialspress.com: <i>«Dobbiamo<strong> </strong>metaforicamente uccidere il giornalista, seppellirlo e ricreare i contorni di una professione investita di un cruciale ruolo sociale. Reinventarsi partendo da zero ci sembra una missione quantomai attraente e complicata, ma soprattutto necessaria».</i> Un po' forte, no? Però ci piace osare. Cambiando discorso, vi accennavamo di Tribuna Italia. Ecco, appunto: di noi potete fidarvi, sappiamo come fare ed in passato, puntando soprattutto sul capitale umano, con il nostro team di giovani giornalisti agguerriti siamo riusciti ad ottenere un notevole livello di scrittura. Purtroppo però, dopo quasi tre anni di attività e pubblicazioni serrate, Tribuna Italia è scomparso dal web a causa del mancato rinnovo del dominio da parte del nostro ex editore. Dalle ceneri del precedente esperimento editoriale nasce l'internazionale e più ambizioso Millennials Press. Nell'ultimo anno di Tribuna Italia, continuando sugli stessi ritmi avremmo raggiunto 1.5 milioni di click. Senza investire un centesimo nei social, senza aver mai ricevuto un rimborso spese o niente del genere. Non male, in fondo. Ma non siamo soliti accontentarci e con MP vogliamo almeno raddoppiare in un tempo minore. </p>
<p>D'altra parte, ci dispiace ammetterlo, ma sinceramente il raggiungimento di risultati così ambiziosi non dipende unicamente da noi. Non scopriamo l'America dicendo che il web offre numerose opportunità a bassi costi, perciò in molti hanno intrapreso questa strada e la concorrenza è feroce. Nonostante tutto, ci siamo ripromessi di aprire nuove strade, camminando fuori dai sentieri convenzionali. Questo potrà certamente aiutarci. </p>
<p>Per noi è importante che il maggior numero di persone legga questo scritto. Capiremo chi di voi non avrà la possibilità materiale di contribuire ma sarà comunque interessato ad aiutarci.

Why Did I Write Rock'n'Roll Unravelled?


 I looked for a long time for a book that told the story of rock'n'roll, from its roots in the blues, to punk rock in the mid-1970s. I also wanted to know about the  influences outside the music, the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights struggle, the Cold War and the many other factors that had a major influence on the music of the 1950s, '60s and '70s.  
The book I was searching for quite clearly did not exist so I decided to write it myself.  Over seven years of meticulous research later - Rock’n’Roll Unravelled is here!





Rock'n Roll Teasers      (more below...)

The answers can all be found in Rock'n'Roll Unravelled...
1. Which American DJ is accredited with coining the phrase ""rock'n'roll""?
2. Who recorded the original version of Twist and Shout?  (Clue: it was produced by Phil Spector and it was not the Beatles or the Isley Brothers.)
3. Which punk band released both the first UK punk single and the first UK punk album? 

What Is Rock'n'Roll Unravelled About?


Rock’n’Roll Unravelled's 700 pages tell the story of rock'n'roll, from its roots in gospel, blues, jazz, R&B and country, up until it turned full circle with punk rock in the mid-1970s.  Punk took the music back to its roots of two-minute songs, played by non-virtuoso musicians in small, intimate venues.  The book includes the music scenes on both sides of the Atlantic and also traces the growth of British rock'n'roll through trad jazz and skiffle.


As well as the music, Rock’n’Roll Unravelled looks at the outside events that helped to shape the sounds of the time, the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights struggle, the Cold War and many others.
There is a wealth of information in Rock'n'Roll Unravelled, including:

Notable gigs and lineups - where the musicians came from when they joined and went to when they left.
Recording sessions, albums and singles: originals, covers, writers, producers; the story behind the song

Some of rock'n'roll's might-have-been moments: failed auditions, 'lost' albums, plagiarism, litigation

Famous TV, movie and theatre performances

Rock'n'Roll high jinks and mayhem - includes Led Zeppelin's Mud Shark Incident, Alice Cooper and the chicken, Ozzy Osbourne and that bat!  

Rock'n'Roll landmarks
Births and deaths - 27 Club 

Background to how the likes of The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd came together
An artist's band history

Groundbreaking producers: Phil Spector, Sam Phillips, Joe Meek +++



PLUS the events that shaped the music...
Vietnam War: the story, from Dien Bien Phu to the fall of Saigon 
Civil Rights: landmark events, Rosa Parks, Schoolhouse Door stand +++
Cold War: Bay of Pigs, Cuban Crisis, McCarthy witch hunts +++
Assassinations: Kennedy brothers, Martin Luther King
Social and political events: Rivers of Blood speech, Che Guevare's death 


AND SO MUCH MORE...
This is 700 jam-packed pages of the life and times of rock'n'roll!  
The Book has a Unique Three-Part Structure 
 Rock’n’Roll Unravelled's unique three-part structure brings the music, lives and times of the 1950s, '60s and '70s vividly to life.      PART 1: Timeline PART 2: What Happened Today? PART 3: Pocket Histories 
PART 1: Timeline 

The Timeline gives a chronological listing for all of the events
described in Part 2, What Happened Today?  It provides a perspective and enables the observer to read between rock’n’roll’s lines. Discover what else was happening
around the time that, say, the Beatles released their debut single Love
Me Do in the UK on 5 October 1962.  (Amongst other things, we stood at the very brink of World War III and nuclear annihilation!)  See careers wax and wane, as musical genres move from one to another.  The Timeline
includes many singles, albums, covers and originals, providing a soundtrack of the era.PART 2: What Happened Today?


Set in a day-by-day,
January to December format, What Happened
Today? recounts gigs, record releases, recording sessions, band
backgrounds, birthdays, deaths, festivals, movies, ‘lost’ albums, failed
auditions, plagiarism, literary landmarks, famous TV appearances, infamous rock’n’roll events, such as Led Zeppelin’s notorious Mud
Shark Incident (28 July 1969), and much, much more.PART 3: Pocket Histories

A comprehensive cross-referencing of the people, bands and events in What Happened Today? can be found in Pocket Histories.  It also includes: band histories for
individuals; backstories of how the major bands came together; lineups at
particular gigs, often with additional information about where musicians came
from or went to when they joined or moved on, and much, much more.




About the Author: Derek Shelmerdine

 In a nutshell, I'm a baby boomer who lived through the period and along the way became: an avid record collector, vinyl of course; drummer, initially in the 1960s but recently returned to the drum seat, see me at the book launch at Liverpool's Cavern Club on 1 June; roadie, I worked with Pat Travers and Meat Ticket; record dealer, collectable 1950s, '60s and '70s vinyl; radio researcher and guest,  but first and foremost, an enthusiastic music fan.  
I currently make a regular monthly appearance as a guest on Meridian FM, in Dave Roberts's Music for Grown Ups radio show.  The topics vary and have so far included: how Cream came together, the Stiff Records story, David Bowie's career and the rise and fall of American rock'n'roll.  My next appearance is on 28 April, a litttle after 8.00 pm.  This week's topic is the Undreground Scene of the mid-late 1960s, please join me on http://www.meridianfm.com/ 
The last seven years spent writing and researching Rock’n’Roll Unravelled have been a real labour of love. I am now a regular blogger, with a website, Twitter and Facebook accounts, all dedicated to the lives and times of rock'n'roll.

Thanks to our core circle of friends and students, we have raised almost enough funds for editing.
We still have a long way to go to pay for graphics, printing and advertising.
Please contribute generously and share this campaign to help us meet our funding goals.
Check out the draft cover! 
3D image created by my son Iain Barrett Byrnes.  Design by Mark Gerardi.  Mark will be adding roots, nature images and power animals to this design to depict the balance required to live a tantra lifestyle. 
Please donate generously, so we can proceed with this exciting project.  Be part of bringing something that is needed to the world.  Thank you!

News about the fundraising campaign...We have a very special publishing team on board!Mark Gerardi has agreed to illustrate the book.  Mark has a long career in graphic design, as well as sharing qi gong, reiki and shamanism in his community.  I chose Mark because I know his spiritual practice will infuse the cover and illustrations he will be creating for the book.  He also has a strong interest in deepening his knowledge of tantra by illustrating the visual transformational journey. www.luminousandhealthy.comHeather Perkins has agreed to do the final editing of the book.  Heather has many years of professional editing experience and also lives a spiritual lifestyle.  Heather and I often encourage each other to ""meditate on it"".  She will be meditating before each editing session.  http://mysteriousartemis.comEach chapter of the book was channeled after meditation or an extended practice.  I am grateful to have gathered a team who will offer the finishing touches in the same fashion.Mark and Heather are waiting in the wings for the funding we need to begin.  We appreciate all the ""shares"" and feel your support.  We still have quite a way to go to meet our funding needs of $5000.  Please donate any amount you can spare to help get the momentum going.  Continue to share the link below and offer as much financial support as you can to bring this book to the world by Spring 2014.

My name is Prana Regina Barrett and I have written the book Lighter. Living Tantra.

I wrote this book because, over the past 4 years, while sharing Tantra to Love™ workshops worldwide, I have seen a growing interest in the general public to learn Tantra and incorporate these practices into daily life.

As a lifelong Tantra practitioner, I have experienced the highs of coming into one’s fullest potential, as well as the lows when one feels exposed and vulnerable.  Both are part of the transformational journey of returning back to the True Self. 

You see, Tantra practices, done ongoing and adopted as as a holistic lifestyle, reopen energy centers within the body, also known as chakras.  This is a positive and therapeutic experience and can also leave the practitioner feeling vulnerable and confused at times.  

As the body loosens around chakras, through movement, meditation, sound, breath and bodywork, the Tantra practitioner can become childlike and vulnerable.  Simultaneously, the practitioner must practice techniques that keep her grounded and assist her in living in a new way that is supportive and allows the True Self, one's true identity, to thrive.

Lighter.  Living Tantra guides the Tantra practitioner through this transformational journey and provides supportive techniques for coming into ones fullest potential, true purpose and to live out one's unique destiny.

Examples of the techniques suggested in the book include a Kriya style 3rd eye meditation to raise energy and a Taoist gold ball meditation for grounding energy.   As readers are guided to share their true identity with others, they will find the chapters on communication and sharing energy very helpful.

The book is accessible to all and is written for those who are curious about Tantra and others who are on the path and interested in supplemental guidance.

It will be a recommended resource to all our students, of all ages and from around the world, who are seeking spiritual and sacred connection with themselves and others.

Here are a sample list of the chapters...

Why Choose a Tantra Lifestyle?

Self Love

Transforming The Ego

Clear, Honest and Loving Communication

Sharing Energy

May I have sparked your interest enough to, now, talk about how you can support the book's publication.  I would appreciate any support you can provide.  Today, I am beginning my Indietogogo fundraising campaign for a conservative amount of $5000, which will help to cover editing, illustration and publishing costs, as well as to pay for some effective advertising.   Tantra to Love™ is absorbing all time spent writing and any additional marketing costs required.  

I am setting my fundraising goal at $5000, so I meet my intention and receive the highest percentage of funds raised.  If I exceed my fundraising goal, even better!  Please offer your support in any amount.  Your generosity is appreciated.  Check out some of the investment incentives being offered for certain donation levels.

We would like the book to be ready for distribution at our upcoming annual Spring retreat at Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health scheduled for late March 2014.

Less than 2 days remaining to meet our funding needs, so please don't delay in making your donation.

Thank you for your support in bringing these teachings to the world in paper and Ebook form.  It will be available on Amazon.com, in local book stores and in academic settings, available to all who are guided to read it.

If you would like to read the book blog, which contains a few sample chapters: Self Love (7/13/12) and Tantra Lifestyle for Healing and Transformation (4/18/12), visit www.tantratolove.com/blog. The book has received support from some of my main teachers: Sylvia Brallier of Tantric Shamanism Mystery School, Michael Lee, founder of Phoenix Rising Yoga Therapy and Ann Carroll, my Qi Gong Teacher.  They have all made contributions to the blog, along with other colleagues and students.  Enjoy reading and please join the conversation.  We enjoy your comments.

From cellular, WiFi, boosting, satellite and more. </p><p>By the time we were part way through the topics, we knew this couldn't be covered in a single post - in needed to be an book. </p><p>And thus, the first edition of <b><a href=""http://www.technomadia.com/the-mobile-internet-handbook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Mobile Internet Handbook</a> </b>was born: </p><p style=""""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/560856/files/20140506092818-IMG_7527.jpg?1399393698"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Despite the book being put together rather last minute, it's been very well received, and positively reviewed by prominent RVers and on Amazon as being a valuable resource for RVers who need to keep online - whether for work, keeping in touch with loved ones, paying bills &amp; routing or even for entertainment.  </p><p><br/></p><p><b>Table of contents from the first edition:</b><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/553124/files/20140502145414-tableofcontents.jpg?1399067654"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>As mobile technology is constantly changing, it's time to update the book before it gets too far out of date. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/560815/files/20140506091042-IMG_7096.jpg?1399392642"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>But we don't want to just update it make it current, <i>we also want to create new content &amp; resources to help more people live vibrant and connected mobile lives</i>.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We put the first edition together as on a shoestring budget, and as quickly as we could so we could get back to our 'real jobs'. </p><p>This time around, we want to create a better and more comprehensive resource.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/560805/files/20140506090536-IMG_1517.jpg?1399392336"" src="""" style=""width: 585.3333333333333px; height: 439px;""/></p><p></p><p>We've been holding off on the update as there's a bunch of new developments 'just around the corner' in mobile internet - from new boosters, new offerings and more.  So while we have the time, we want to see if there is interest in expanded content - not just an update. <br/></p><p>This will take time, and investment of money for graphics, layout and editing. </p><p>If you'd find a resource like this valuable -  we could really use your commitment to pre-buying the book, our services or being an sponsor.

<li>
<b>Editing: </b>We'd like to hire a professional editor to make sure the content is grammatically solid. This will cost around $400. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Layout:</b> We want to do it right from the beginning and make sure each edition of the book is formatted properly for PDF, Kindle, iBooks and print.  This will require research, and possible investment in tools and/or consulting with a professional service experienced with book layout.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Our Time</b>: With funding, we can fully focus on the re-write instead of other income earning projects.</li>
</ul><p><b>And if you fund any level that includes a copy of the new eBook, you'll also be given a promo code to get a copy of the current edition now to get you started.

<p></p><p></p></div>","Thanks to this campaign, we have:Released the 2014 Edition of the book...  More than double in size from the first edition, greatly expanded, completely updated, professionally edited and illustrated. Get it at:http://www.rvmobileinternet.com/bookWe have created a brand new RV Mobile Internet Resource Center to help keep RVers up to date on news and information, to keep the book living beyond publication.. check it out at:http://www.rvmobileinternet.comWe have also launched and are accepting members into our premium membership group called 'Mobile Internet Aficionados' at:http://www.rvmobileinternet.com/membership Thank you again for your belief in us.. this has been an amazing summer since we launched this campaign, completely focused on writing this book and launching this new resource!! We could not have done it without your support!!The Original Campaign:We are Chris Dunphy and Cherie Ve Ard, full time 'Technomads' who blog at www.technomadia.com - living and working on the road full time since 2006, mostly as US based RVers. Our primary career is application development, technology consulting, and advising. We depend on mobile internet to work remotely, and have navigated a lot of the technological obstacles over the years. With our extensive experience working in the tech industry and journalism, we love combining our passions to share what we've learned to make this obstacle easier for others hitting the road. Our lives really are a living laboratory for mobile tech. Last year, we started writing a comprehensive blog post about all the options for keeping online while being mobile. From cellular, WiFi, boosting, satellite and more. By the time we were part way through the topics, we knew this couldn't be covered in a single post - in needed to be an book. And thus, the first edition of The Mobile Internet Handbook was born: Despite the book being put together rather last minute, it's been very well received, and positively reviewed by prominent RVers and on Amazon as being a valuable resource for RVers who need to keep online - whether for work, keeping in touch with loved ones, paying bills & routing or even for entertainment.  Table of contents from the first edition:As mobile technology is constantly changing, it's time to update the book before it gets too far out of date. But we don't want to just update it make it current, we also want to create new content & resources to help more people live vibrant and connected mobile lives.What We Need & What You GetWe put the first edition together as on a shoestring budget, and as quickly as we could so we could get back to our 'real jobs'. This time around, we want to create a better and more comprehensive resource.  We've been holding off on the update as there's a bunch of new developments 'just around the corner' in mobile internet - from new boosters, new offerings and more.  So while we have the time, we want to see if there is interest in expanded content - not just an update. This will take time, and investment of money for graphics, layout and editing. If you'd find a resource like this valuable -  we could really use your commitment to pre-buying the book, our services or being an sponsor. This will help us devote the time & resources to make this book be the most awesome it can be. Book CostsThe costs we'll incur to create the book include:
Graphics: We're working with a graphic designer to create cover art and materials for the book. The initial cost is around $600. There's also been requests for more graphical illustrations throughout the book to make the concepts clearer, each will require time and/or money to create. The more money we raise, the more graphics we can create. 


Editing: We'd like to hire a professional editor to make sure the content is grammatically solid. This will cost around $400. 


Layout: We want to do it right from the beginning and make sure each edition of the book is formatted properly for PDF, Kindle, iBooks and print.  This will require research, and possible investment in tools and/or consulting with a professional service experienced with book layout.


Our Time: With funding, we can fully focus on the re-write instead of other income earning projects.
And if you fund any level that includes a copy of the new eBook, you'll also be given a promo code to get a copy of the current edition now to get you started. It's still relevant, especially if you're willing to read our updated blog content to bring the content up to date. Funding GoalsIf we can meet our minimum funding goal, we feel that will cover the basic costs to do the re-write right with proper professional graphics, layout and editing.We'll be able to update the content to reflect the current offerings and integrate in our existing expanded content. The book update will include at least updates like: 
Millenicom's current offerings

Changes in the cellular market in terms of contracts & pricing

Alternatives to Millenicom for no-contract cellular data

Lots of new 5-band cellular boosters that are just hitting the market, as well as the new FCC regulations for using them

Upcoming developments we're keeping our eye on.

If we exceed the goal, we can do even more - more illustrations, more chapters/content and more resources for everyone.
Stretch Goals:If we exceed our funding goal, we will know that we have the support to spend the time creating the following extra content:

Funded! $3,500 - Illustrated Glossary, explaining all of the components of mobile internet in basic terms. 

Funded! $4,000 - Installation Tips & Tricks Chapter

Funded!  $6,000 - Antennas & Mounting Techniques (featuring Jack Mayer!) - We'll be working with guest author and RV tech guru Jack Mayer to produce a chapter dedicated to antennas, maximizing signal, attaching them to masts or the roof of your RV, and how to keep them securely mounted (and water out!). 


Funded!! - “I’m Mobile & Connected!” T-Shirt: We will work with our designer to create a totally awesome T-Shirt that proclaims to the world just how mobile connected you are. If we cross this threshold, this will be added as a new perk - and all supporters over $100 will get this added for free.


Funded!!!  $7,500 - Entertainment Expansion - we'll cover more information on alternatives to streaming TV and movies, including satellite TV options, and our recommendations for enjoying media on the road. We'll also cover online gaming on the road!

Premium Membership We also want to add an optional premium membership area where we can further help folks understand and keep on top of this vital and constantly changing topic. Some of the services we'd love to provide are:

Mobile tech changes often, and you'll be in the know and have it explained as to how it impacts you as a traveler. The full content will be released to premium members first.

Also, we'll be working on more Comic Books to bring to you!15k: Not everyone likes to read, so what about an Audio Book? That is a great idea, but not a regular Audio Book, no! We want it to be EPIC! So with your help we will turn our story just this! We are talking about sound effects, great voice actors, excellent narration and even it’s own orchestral music. Something for the best Audio Book experience.25k:  So you're saying to yourself, gosh, a digital artbook/infobook sounds neat, but I wish I could play in this world. Well, lucky for you, we have plans to make the Defenders of the Cross Online Adventure Game so you can continue the story in a Virtual World. If we hit this stretch goal, you will be getting to play Defenders of the Cross!Even if we don't hit these goal, know that it is one of the first big ones that we have in mind post-campaign. Your donations would just make them available sooner rather than later!So maybe you're saying to yourself hey, yeah, okay, this sounds like something that I'd like to read, but I don't have two pennies to rub together. HOW DO I MAKE SURE THAT MY FUTURE HAS MORE D.O.T.C. BOOKS FULL OF ADVENTURES?Well, there are several ways that you can help make this thing a reality! If you can't donate, but still want to see Defenders of the Cross make it to print, please shout your support from the proverbial e-hills.

She lives in Devon on Fredericton's northside with her daughter Audrey. <br/>Soon after her daughter was born, Madeleine began volunteering at a midwife's office, where she developed a passion for a strong and healthy start for children by teaching parenting classes. She is also a leader in promoting community gardens and food security in her role as Community Food Mentor. It is Madeleine's interest in food and water security, and local resilience, that led to her accepting a nomination to be the MLA candidate for the Green Party in Fredericton North.</p><blockquote>""I live a very active life and am committed to working for a healthy and sustainable community, so pursuing the nomination for the Green Party in Fredericton North is a natural extension of the life I have chosen,"" said Ms. Berrevoets.</blockquote><p><b>The Fredericton North Campaign </b></p><p>Madeleine has been involved in green and community issues for years, but with the upcoming legislative election, she became concerned that the voice of the community - young people concerned about the environment, parents concerned with their children's careers and health, and retirees worried about the safety and value of their pensions - would not be represented by the parties that typically govern our province. <br/>Madeleine decided to become involved in the political process so that she could work for the safety and values of the people of New Brunswick - to oppose corruption and misinformation surrounding vital environmental and economic issues. <br/>As MLA, Madeleine will work hard to build a strong local economy, create clean green jobs, improve healthcare, modernize transportation, protect pensions, and much more. Madeleine is grateful for the opportunity to help create a green future for New Brunswick.</p><p><b>What We Need </b></p><p>Running a campaign is difficult and expensive, especially when most of our existing supporters are young, working-class families, or retirees whose pensions are stretched thin by rising living costs, and can't afford to donate thousands of dollars at a time. As a result, we have to be as efficient as possible with every dollar and volunteer hour we can get. We feel that one of the best uses for campaign contributions are centrally-located, high-impact signage and informative flyers that remind voters that the Green Party is here to serve them. <br/>As such, we'll need - for example:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">4' x 8' large signs for selected intersections (approx. $70 ea.)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">1.5' x 2' lawn signs for supporters (approx. $10 ea.) </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Staging materials and labor for signs (approx. $500 total) </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Plus the costs of various rentals, fees, and so on...</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p>But we're not in this for the money. We all have our own full- and part-time jobs, and like you, we prefer to earn our own income. Of the $35,000 maximum amount each candidate is allowed to raise, we're only asking for $15,000. That's just enough to run a modest but effective campaign.</p><p><b>What You Get</b></p><p>As a reward for contributing to Madeleine's campaign, every supporter who enters their full mailing address will receive a Green Party button and a Thank You card. <br/>To keep things simple, we will be offering only two distinct Perk levels for regular contributors:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">At $50, contributors will receive a Green Party T-Shirt, allowing them to show their support for the Green Party wherever they go</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">At $100, contributors will receive a Green Party T-Shirt and an invitation to our Post-Election Party at a local pub</span><br/>

</ul><p></p><p><b>As well as special prizes for our Social Media Sharing Contest volunteers!<br/>(See the bottom of this page for Contest details)</b></p><p>We've chosen the ""Flexible Funding"" fee option for our campaign, so that even if we don't reach our funding goal, we'll still be able to make use of your contributions - it just won't go quite as far. <br/>And remember, because these donations are TAX DEDUCTIBLE, if you include all of your contact information when donating, you will get 75% of your donation back when you file your taxes. <br/>That breaks down to: </p><p>Your Contribution | Your Cost  | <b>Tax Credit</b></p><p>$25                              $ 6.25             <b>$18.75</b></p><p>$50                             $12.50            <b>$32.50</b></p><p>$100                           $25.00           <b>$75.00</b></p><p>$250                           $75.00          <b> $175.00</b></p><p>Combined with our the Perks you get for donating, our donors get back more than their actual donation.

We will be able to move policy and the development of our beautiful province toward the kind of future you want!</p><p><b>The Challenges</b></p><p>Running against large, established parties means that the Green Party must take innovative approaches to not just canvassing and fundraising, but to campaigning and organizing in general. While the two usual governing parties have virtual armies of experienced volunteers and paid staff, the Green Party must be as flexible and efficient as possible. This means using social technologies, online fundraising and communication tools, and other familiar, yet high impact methods to gain support. This also means that we need regular citizens like you to help out - even just in small ways - wherever and whenever you can, so our collective efforts have a chance against the established power structures in the province. <br/>To do this, of course, we will need donations. But there are many other ways to contribute to the Green Party's success.

We're a wing of insurgent cool cats all the way from <a href=""http://www.foxandraven.co.za"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fox &amp; Raven Publishing</a>, and we're on a mission to get books into the hands of every underprivileged South African - for FREE.</p>
<p>Now, this is our first double-book donation.

<p>And this is where you come in. The bottom line is that most South Africans simply cannot afford books. As book-lovers, this saddens us. So we're doing something about it, and we hope you'll join in too.</p>
<p>The premise is simple: by donating to this campaign, you'll secure an ebook of Ravensmoot for yourself, and sponsor a print version of the book to a community that needs literature!</p>
<p>We've set our goal at $1000 - that's $10 per book. For every $10 we receive more than that, we'll simply donate another copy of Ravensmoot – and that's all there is to it.</p>

And this is where you come in. The bottom line is that most South Africans simply cannot afford books. As book-lovers, this saddens us. So we're doing something about it, and we hope you'll join in too.
The premise is simple: by donating to this campaign, you'll secure an ebook of Ravensmoot for yourself, and sponsor a print version of the book to a community that needs literature!
We've set our goal at $1000 - that's $10 per book. For every $10 we receive more than that, we'll simply donate another copy of Ravensmoot – and that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hur Publishing is a brand new indie Canadian publisher based out of Montreal and Vancouver. We make beautiful print books in limited editions, because we believe the book is a form of art.

The Book


Midnight Reigns is a paranormal thriller with a sexy edge. The young protagonist, Viviane, loses the things she found most important in her life: her boyfriend, her Great Grandmother and her life as a dancer. Broken, she moves far away from the rest of her family and shuts down her ancestral gifts.
A killer is stalking her killing young women in a horrific fashion.  Will Viviane be the next victim or will she unlock the gifts she closed off and save herself.
Enter the world of the supernatural where demons, vampires, werewolves and more lurk in the darkness as well as the daylight. Will the “sleepers” ever find out about the paranormal happenings that go on around them or will they be forever oblivious.
Do you really want to know what goes bump in the night? What lurks under your bed, or what hides in your closet? 
I dreamed this book for weeks before I began to explore where Viviane's journey would take her. In the darkest hours of the night, these characters came to me. They want to be known; they want to tell their tale.

<p>I am Chars Bonin, a filmmaker and storyteller from Minnesota.  About 10 years ago, while reading a book to my 1 year old son, I decided that I should make a series of children's books that teach kids good life lessons.  I chose to have animals living on a pond, with the characters Harry and Harrietta Rabbitson (Rabbits), Carl Croaks and Rhonda Ribbit (Frogs), Nora Nibbler and Tommy TwoSlaps (Beavers), Sarah Squawks (Bird), Mr. Galapagos (Turtle) and Growles (the Bear).</p>
<p>Now I am turning 50, and have 3 more boys.  Life has gotten in the way of my getting these books made.  My youngest child is now 3 years old, and I am hoping to have the first book published in time that he can enjoy the lessons of ""The Golden Pond"".</p>
<p>I am looking for your help.  I have the first three stories ready. ""Growles the Bear"", ""Mrs. Rabbitson's Special Day"" and ""The Wrong Way Tree"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How to help get the first book made? ""Growles the Bear"".</h3>
<p>I need to raise as much of the money as I can to get ""Growles the Bear"" made.</p>
<p>It will cost about $10,000 to get each book made. This will allow me to get an illustrator to bring my story to life, get the book published, and have a little marketing to get the word out about how to get copies.</p>
<p>Donations of any amount will be welcome and appreciated, but I have a few perks that I am offering at different levels of support.</p>
<p>$10- $40 will get you a 10%- 25% off coupon when the book is ready for order.</p>
<p>$50 will get you a copy of the book signed by the author.</p>
<p>$100+ will get you a copy of the book with a personalized message from the author.</p>
<p>$2,500 (4 available per book) will get a short dedication of your choosing, as part of the print in the book.</p>
<p>If I do not raise the full amount to get ""Growles the Bear"" completed.  I will use your generosity towards paying the illustrator and getting as far along as I can.  I will then personally contribute to complete the story of Growles.  I really want to get this first book made before I turn 51 years of age.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Generosity could have a Huge Impact</h3>
<p>With life lessons coming to children from ""The Golden Pond"", your generosity could make a big difference! </p>
<p>""Growles the Bear"" will teach kids that looks can lead you to believe things that are not true.</p>
<p>""Mrs. Rabbitson's Big Day"" tells the lesson that it might not be the best to get a gift you will want for someone you love, but to get them a gift that they will love.  While also looking at each characters differences in what they love.</p>
<p>""The Wrong Way Tree"" teaches about the strength of working together.</p>
<p>This is my first venture as an author, but I have written, directed and produced a feature film (Finding Home - which can be found on Amazon streaming services including Prime Video).  I have won awards for writing screenplays in Hollywood, Australia and India.  I have also won awards for my acting, producing, and more both Nationally and locally in Minnesota.  I have researched the process of getting these stories published and marketed, and I have everything ready to make that happen.  All I need is that little push from you to allow me to take the steps to make it happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with everything, there are obstacles that can pop up.  In life, in projects, or health.  I feel that with the research I have done, and the preparations I have made with this first book, I am ready and able to handle nearly all potential roadblocks.  I shot an entire 90 minute film (using 1 camera) in just 10 days.  My sound designer, Tom Colvin, said this about me...""Chars can stay cool under tough conditions and get the ball of progress rolling.""</p>
<p>I will get this book made if it takes me another 10 years.  But I feel confident that, with your help, we can get it printed before Black Friday 2021! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that not everyone has the means to donate monetarily.  There is still a way you can help!</p>
<p>Let others know about this project. You can use the Indiegogo share tools for this opportunity, or just let them know that this book series is in the works.</p>
<p>And when the books are ready, spread the word to all of those that may want to read them to their children or grandchildren!</p>
<p>I sincerely thank you, for all of the support you have given me over the years!</p>
<p>May God bless you!</p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>The Sinner is a modern horror novel following Isaac Martinez who must come face to face with the sins of his past. Martinez has to encounter a creature that haunts his hometown, and specifically Isaac himself. He must find out what is causing this horrid creature’s appearance and how he plays into the overall terror that this town faces.<br/><br/>My name is Blake Johnson and I am the author of The Sinner. I wrote this book because the feeling of not being welcome at one’s own home is universal and a terrifying reality.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the horror of introspection and finding out darker desires that motivate you. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to look into a mirror revealing what it truly means to be oneself and why we do the things we do.<br/><br/><strong>The Novel:</strong><br/>Isaac Martinez hasn’t returned to his hometown of Bearhaven in almost a decade. Now, drawn back by his job, Isaac is forced to face the people and places he abandoned so long ago. In an effort to reignite his life in a town he used to call home, Isaac makes it his personal mission to not feel like a stranger in his own hometown. His efforts to reignite relationships and his old life are sabotaged by a demon hellbent on taking over Isaac’s sanity.<br/><br/>This creature quickly takes root in Isaac’s mind, and his mission to start a brand new life in an old place become an ever waking nightmare that he soon finds out are caused by the sins of his past.<br/><br/><br/>You will love this book if you are a general fan of horror, mysteries, and an introspective look at what it means to be flawed. The Sinner speaks to horror fans and fans of modern mysteries who want to grapple with the terrors of the digital age mixed with ancient human flaws in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that The Sinner inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<p>How responsible are we for the consequences of our life choices?</p>
<p>What do we owe to the communities that have shaped us to who we are?</p>
<p>How can we know that we’re on the correct paths of our lives, and is it safe to reflect on where we went wrong?</p> I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the weight we put on meeting other’s expectations will change us all for the better.<br/> <p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p> This book will be published with New Degree Press.

</div></div>","Story of My BookThe Sinner is a modern horror novel following Isaac Martinez who must come face to face with the sins of his past. Martinez has to encounter a creature that haunts his hometown, and specifically Isaac himself. He must find out what is causing this horrid creature’s appearance and how he plays into the overall terror that this town faces.My name is Blake Johnson and I am the author of The Sinner. I wrote this book because the feeling of not being welcome at one’s own home is universal and a terrifying reality.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the horror of introspection and finding out darker desires that motivate you. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to look into a mirror revealing what it truly means to be oneself and why we do the things we do.The Novel:Isaac Martinez hasn’t returned to his hometown of Bearhaven in almost a decade. Now, drawn back by his job, Isaac is forced to face the people and places he abandoned so long ago. In an effort to reignite his life in a town he used to call home, Isaac makes it his personal mission to not feel like a stranger in his own hometown. His efforts to reignite relationships and his old life are sabotaged by a demon hellbent on taking over Isaac’s sanity.This creature quickly takes root in Isaac’s mind, and his mission to start a brand new life in an old place become an ever waking nightmare that he soon finds out are caused by the sins of his past.You will love this book if you are a general fan of horror, mysteries, and an introspective look at what it means to be flawed. The Sinner speaks to horror fans and fans of modern mysteries who want to grapple with the terrors of the digital age mixed with ancient human flaws in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that The Sinner inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:How responsible are we for the consequences of our life choices?
What do we owe to the communities that have shaped us to who we are?
How can we know that we’re on the correct paths of our lives, and is it safe to reflect on where we went wrong? I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the weight we put on meeting other’s expectations will change us all for the better. What I Need & What You'll Get This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>Why Can't It Ever Be Simple?</h3>
<p>Seraphina Covington is a 25-year-old human woman born into a shapechanging family. After a 12-year absence, she returns to her family home in the small magical community of Merricott, New Hampshire to find out that all is not as it seems.<br/><br/>A Magic Wielder child, Thomas, is missing. While her aunt dodges dinner to find Thomas, Seraphina reacquaints herself with a house seeped in unhappy memories and a tragic past.<br/><br/>And that’s where things get complicated.<br/><br/>Missing people, reconnecting with her aunt and finding a job aren’t the only problems in Seraphina’s world.<br/><br/>She soon discovers her imaginary childhood friend isn’t imaginary. Angwyndith, the “friend,” is still in her head (and body), has a Universe-balancing purpose, and needs Seraphina to get onboard - now.<br/><br/>What ensues is a struggle for identity, understanding and compromise, as Seraphina and Angwyndith race against the clock to unravel the mystery and stop the Big Bad before more community members disappear.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This Book and This Plot?</h3>
<p>I wrote this book because I had a daydream about a girl with a boogeywoman riding shotgun in her body. A girl who was an outsider. A girl who wasn’t sure who she really was. A girl who was a lot like me when I was younger.<br/><br/>Growing up, I felt invisible. Too many times people would not remember meeting me or thought I looked exactly like their cousin/friend/neighbor and the question changed as a kid from, “Aren’t you Erika’s little sister?” to “Aren’t you married to that English guy?”<br/><br/>My identity wasn’t clearly defined, at least not as perceived by other people, and in time, I came to realize that was because I still hadn’t defined it for myself. They were reflecting back to me what I wanted them to see, and it was time to make sure that reflection was actually my own.<br/><br/>This is part of the journey on which Seraphina travels - figuring out who she is and who she isn’t. And that is, at its core, what this book is about - our identities and our reflections. How much of who you are is because of something you like or how you feel innately, and how much is because of outside (or inside) influences? I know the answer to that question for myself, but for my protagonists, Seraphina and Angwyndith, their journey has just begun.<br/><br/>I hope in reading this book, two things occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>you discover a little something about who you are and how you define yourself, and,</li>
<li>you find yourself lost in my characters’ story, if only for a short time. After all, we could all use a little escapism right now.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's In It For You?</h3>
<p>You’ll love this book if you like flawed characters, don’t mind (or like) a few literary quotes, and like watching those flawed characters grow, learn and evolve. You’ll also love this book if you’re a fan of low fantasy, urban or contemporary fantasy and light mysteries.<br/><br/>For those young adults from their late teens to their mid-twenties, and/or adults on a journey to find themselves or to feel their own impact, this book may help you find a new way forward. Or, it may just let you know you are not alone in your journey. People from all generations struggled with these same questions, just in different clothing and with different tech.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I’d love <i>The Deep Space Between</i> to inspire thoughts and conversation around such questions as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your passions, what do you love, and do they define who you are?</li>
<li>Does an impact need to be big, like saving a life, or can it be as small as a smile?</li>
<li>Are we just defined by our gender, sexuality, or romantic choices, or are we so much more than that?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these tricky questions and more with my readers. I believe showcasing our differences while celebrating our common connections as humans is what can bring us all together.</p>

This book explores intermittent fasting as a simple, cheap, and effective method to not only help lose and maintain a healthy weight, but also to help boost energy levels and even prevent chronic diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.<br/><br/>My name is Arslon Humayun, and I am the author of <i>The Fast Mind</i>. I wrote this book because I feel that we have been getting dieting wrong for decades. Despite the efforts of the diet industry, diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes have become epidemic in nature. Even with all of the diet plans out there, the problem only seems to be growing worse. Whether these diet plans are too difficult to follow or simply don't hold up from a scientific perspective, the end result is the same: frustration and disappointment over a lack of results.<br/><br/><i>The Fast Mind</i> speaks to people who want to grapple with weight loss in a new way. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that there is a simpler alternative out there: intermittent fasting. This method has been tried and tested for thousands of years and does not require stressing over counting calories or cutting out your favorite foods. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to completely reconsider your fundamental relationship with food. I will give you everything you need to know in order to unlock ""The Fast Mind"" so that you are prepared to safely incorporate the practice of intermittent fasting into your daily life.<br/><br/>If you have tried all the diet plans out there and are still not seeing the results you want to see, you will love this book. If you are a busy professional looking to maximize your mental efficiency, you will love this book. If you are perfectly healthy but want to find a way to take a more preventative approach to your long-term health, you will love this book.</p><p><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>The Fast Mind</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>What are the origins of intermittent fasting?</li>
<li>How does intermittent fasting work?</li>
<li>What benefits can intermittent fasting bring to your life beyond weight loss?</li>
<li>How can someone who is completely new to intermittent fasting safely take up the practice?</li>
</ul><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe that rethinking our traditional approach to diet and health will change us all for the better.</p><p> </p><h2>My Book</h2><p><i>The Fast Mind</i> is divided into four parts.<br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the Introduction and Chapters 1-2. Here, the reader will learn about the origins of intermittent fasting. From interviews with professors and religious scholars, we will explore why it is that we can find a shared tradition of fasting across religion and society.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 3-4. Here, the reader will learn about the ways in which the food industry has contributed to the rise of obesity and type 2 diabetes, as well as the science behind why intermittent fasting is the perfect solution to combating these diseases. For example, we will learn about how Dr. Jason Fung has helped thousands of people use intermittent fasting as a tool to help treat obesity and type 2 diabetes in order to prevent kidney disease.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapters 5-6. Here, the reader will learn about how to unlock ""The Fast Mind."" From success stories of celebrities and entrepreneurs to everyday people, this part of the book aims to get you motivated and in the right mindset to safely take on the practice of intermittent fasting.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains Chapter 7. Here, the reader will learn about important practical and health considerations that are involved with taking up intermittent fasting. We will also explore tips and tricks to make your journey with intermittent fasting a rewarding and enjoyable experience.</p><p> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

</ul><p> </p><h2>About the Author</h2><p>Arslon Humayun is a senior at Georgetown University who is majoring in Sociology and on the pre-med track. He is the Co-Founder and Co-President of the Georgetown Sociology Association, a student organization that aims to foster a greater sense of community among students and professors in the Department of Sociology. He is also a co-author of the research publication <i>3,3'-Diindolylmethane Enhances Tumor Regression After Radiation Through Protecting Normal Cells to Modulate Antitumor Immunity</i> in the journal <i>Advances in Radiation Oncology</i>.<br/><br/>Arslon’s unique academic interests allow him to provide insight into the reasons behind why fasting has become a topic of interest in contemporary society. His background also gives him the ability to explain the science behind intermittent fasting in a way that is simple to understand.

This book explores intermittent fasting as a simple, cheap, and effective method to not only help lose and maintain a healthy weight, but also to help boost energy levels and even prevent chronic diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.My name is Arslon Humayun, and I am the author of The Fast Mind. I wrote this book because I feel that we have been getting dieting wrong for decades. Despite the efforts of the diet industry, diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes have become epidemic in nature. Even with all of the diet plans out there, the problem only seems to be growing worse. Whether these diet plans are too difficult to follow or simply don't hold up from a scientific perspective, the end result is the same: frustration and disappointment over a lack of results.The Fast Mind speaks to people who want to grapple with weight loss in a new way. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that there is a simpler alternative out there: intermittent fasting. This method has been tried and tested for thousands of years and does not require stressing over counting calories or cutting out your favorite foods. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to completely reconsider your fundamental relationship with food. I will give you everything you need to know in order to unlock ""The Fast Mind"" so that you are prepared to safely incorporate the practice of intermittent fasting into your daily life.If you have tried all the diet plans out there and are still not seeing the results you want to see, you will love this book. If you are a busy professional looking to maximize your mental efficiency, you will love this book. If you are perfectly healthy but want to find a way to take a more preventative approach to your long-term health, you will love this book.Ultimately, I hope that The Fast Mind inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
What are the origins of intermittent fasting?
How does intermittent fasting work?
What benefits can intermittent fasting bring to your life beyond weight loss?
How can someone who is completely new to intermittent fasting safely take up the practice?
I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe that rethinking our traditional approach to diet and health will change us all for the better. My BookThe Fast Mind is divided into four parts.Part 1 contains the Introduction and Chapters 1-2. Here, the reader will learn about the origins of intermittent fasting. From interviews with professors and religious scholars, we will explore why it is that we can find a shared tradition of fasting across religion and society.Part 2 contains Chapters 3-4. Here, the reader will learn about the ways in which the food industry has contributed to the rise of obesity and type 2 diabetes, as well as the science behind why intermittent fasting is the perfect solution to combating these diseases. For example, we will learn about how Dr. Jason Fung has helped thousands of people use intermittent fasting as a tool to help treat obesity and type 2 diabetes in order to prevent kidney disease.Part 3 contains Chapters 5-6. Here, the reader will learn about how to unlock ""The Fast Mind."" From success stories of celebrities and entrepreneurs to everyday people, this part of the book aims to get you motivated and in the right mindset to safely take on the practice of intermittent fasting.Part 4 contains Chapter 7. Here, the reader will learn about important practical and health considerations that are involved with taking up intermittent fasting. We will also explore tips and tricks to make your journey with intermittent fasting a rewarding and enjoyable experience. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Arduino for Artists is a guide for amateur and professional artists about how to use the Arduino microcontroller platform to create dynamic and interactive works of art. While most how-to books approach Arduino and electronics from a scientific and engineering perspective, Arduino for Artists is designed for creatives who want to use technology as a tool for artistic expression instead.<br/><br/>My name is Matthew McClain and I am the author of Arduino for Artists. I wrote this book to help artists, makers, and creatives alike unlock the Arduino microcontroller platform as a tool for art despite the dearth of Arduino resources designed with that goal in mind.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new way to leave your creative mark on the world using technology. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for electronics, art, and design. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you take your creative ambitions in exciting new directions and create dynamic, animated, interactive works of art using the easy-to-learn and popular Arduino platform.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about programming and wiring Arduino microcontrollers to create art. You'll learn to do things like...</p>
<ul>
<li>Create kinetic art displays using several different types of motors.</li>
<li>Program individually addressable LED light strips to create complex and mesmerizing light displays.</li>
<li>Add sensors to your art pieces, allowing them to respond dynamically to input from their viewers.</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you enjoy making art, sculptures, or working on DIY projects.<br/><br/>Arduino for Artists is a nonfiction book that speaks to artists and makers who want to look at Arduino and art in a new way.<br/> <h3>The Book - Arduino for Artists</h3>
<p>The book is written in 5 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-5. This section covers the basics of programming an Arduino and connecting electronic components to allow it to interact with the outside world.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 6-10. This section delves deep into using LED strips and other types of electrical lights to create captivating and emotive light displays for your art projects.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 11-12. This section explores how to use motors to add the element of motion to art pieces and sculptures.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains chapter 13. This covers using sensors with the Arduino to allow your art to detect and respond dynamically to stimuli from the outside world.<br/><br/><strong>Part 5</strong> contains chapter 14. This final section explores integrating Arduino with other tools useful for creating art, such as the Processing programming language and separate machines and appliances.</p>

The impact is so great on our younger generations, yet many times it impacts them in a NEGATIVE way. When I reflect on my growing up I can recognize that the media was a huge barrier in allowing me to love myself and accept me for me. Inwardly and outwardly. I want to change that. I want to be a voice in the community of women where they can remember that they are of value regardless of their talents, beliefs, size, or the society that they live in. </span></font></div>

We will be featuring real girls of real sizes and shapes to model for our fashion spreads , promoting self-love and acceptance of one's body shape. Our editorials and articles will allow women to have a voice about their beliefs and points of views without being stomped on by professors, teachers, or peers who think that they know better. I want to reinvent the traditional young women's lifestyle magazine. I want to begin to revamp the way the media impacts and influences young women.  This is by no means meant to be a personal gain on my part, but a gain for women's empowerment and opportunity as young women strive to achieve their goals and dreams. </span></font></div>

</h3></div></div>","KHLOE stands for: 

Klothes & style

Health & fitness

Love & relationships

Opportunity

Empowering women

 These words are what KHLOE stands for and represents the young woman's lifestyle magazine with it's first issue being published on 11/11/11.  I have been so blessed in the past year with my career, I have felt it laid on my heart to give back. To start something bigger than myself and my writing company, I want to give back to the world. I have always been raised that whatever we do, we need to make the world a better place. I believe our time on earth is meant to do good in this world.

 

KHLOE is something I am very passionate about; please, help me achieve this dream so I can change women's ambitions, self-esteem, and futures one issue at a time. Please, help us launch our FIRST ISSUE of KHLOE magazine.

 

You are probably asking "" HOW"" is this not like any other young or adult women's magazine? 

 KHLOE Magazine, will be made available both in print (at select highschool and college campuses) and online worldwide ; it will be ENTIRELY created by women looking to launch their creative careers.

 The articles, editorials, photojournalistic expressions, design, and fashion spreads will be entirely created and contributed by young adult women looking to launch their careers. Anyone in the media and entertainment world knows that once you are published, featured, or produced; it makes your career dreams  a hell of a lot easier to become acheivable. I can attest to that. KHLOE will be that launch pad, it will be their means of jump starting their careers with KHLOE as their base and springboard. 

 The MEDIA has SUCH a HUGE impact on the world we live in.  It is where we source our information, trends, and opinions. The impact is so great on our younger generations, yet many times it impacts them in a NEGATIVE way. When I reflect on my growing up I can recognize that the media was a huge barrier in allowing me to love myself and accept me for me. Inwardly and outwardly. I want to change that. I want to be a voice in the community of women where they can remember that they are of value regardless of their talents, beliefs, size, or the society that they live in. 

With that being said, the magazine will not be restricted to size 0, 6 foot tall models for our style and fashion spreads. We will be featuring real girls of real sizes and shapes to model for our fashion spreads , promoting self-love and acceptance of one's body shape. Our editorials and articles will allow women to have a voice about their beliefs and points of views without being stomped on by professors, teachers, or peers who think that they know better. I want to reinvent the traditional young women's lifestyle magazine. I want to begin to revamp the way the media impacts and influences young women.  This is by no means meant to be a personal gain on my part, but a gain for women's empowerment and opportunity as young women strive to achieve their goals and dreams. 

. Launching this project is NOT possible without financially backing and support. We have raised over $4,000 over the summer to start this organization, publication, and revolution. We are now moving into production, distribution, and promotion of this fantastic magazine that is already touching lives worldwide. 


 I ask for your love and support in this endeavor. Your prayers, good wishes, and encouragement as I embark on this huge campaign!

LOVE AND KHLOE!

<p>My name is Melissa Luznicky Garrett and I am an author of four published novels.</p>
<p>I was one of those kids who knew from a very early age that she wanted to be an author when she grew up. It didn't matter if it was bad poetry or a rambling novel that lacked direction, I was always writing. Even before I knew how to (technically speaking) read and write, I was churning out “stories” on my mother’s typewriter. That was back in the day when there was no such thing as a delete key, and you had to type very slowly and carefully so as not to make (m)any mistakes.</p>
<p>But LIFE, in the form of a husband and three children, happened shortly after high school, and writing was relegated to the back burner. Suddenly I was up to my neck in dirty diapers and runny noses, with no time to even sneeze. It wasn’t until my youngest child started preschool, and I actually had time to read something other than the <em>What to Expect</em> series, that I rediscovered my love of writing.</p>
<p>After many years of writing nothing at all, I put a tentative pen to paper in the fall of 2007. I very quickly churned out my first novel Precipice. Needless to say, I’ve had many years to work on my craft, and Precipice has become the ugly baby everyone says is cute (I fear) just to be nice. In other words, it's time that poor book got a makeover! And although I can handle what happens between the pages, I know nothing about cover design. Fortunately, I have a brilliant cover designer who knows just how to capture the very essence of a book. He created the covers for both The Spirit Keeper and Blood Type, and he will continue to create <strong>all</strong> of my covers if I have anything to say about it!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, professionally designed covers don’t come cheap, and indie authors typically don’t have much pocket money to spare. Still, I know firsthand how important it is to have a cover that stands out from the rest and grabs the buyer’s attention. I’ve received numerous emails from new fans who’ve all said they wouldn’t have given The Spirit Keeper and Blood Type a chance if not for the cover . . . and they're all glad they did! So really, a stunning cover is a win-win for everyone.</p>

</p><p>Unlimited Ebooks gives readers the ability to download as many books as you want from an extensive online library. It's an adventurous alternative to the 'vanilla' flavor of typical traditional publishers. Discover the next bestsellers, rising-star writers &amp; indie authors. Find it all from real &amp; raw to controversial - both fiction and non-fiction. Offering formats for tablets, ereaders, browsers and smartphones to enjoy anytime &amp; anywhere! <br/></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/180199/files/20131106123343-t1.png?1383770023"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>Unlimited Ebooks is part of an initiative to promote reading
and literacy worldwide, created in 2013 by Chris Benjamin.<span> Like free source code in the computing industry, I hope that unlimited content combined with less editorial interference and censorship will increase reading to spark new insights and wisdom worldwide.  At the same time, we're promoting undiscovered &amp; independent authors who otherwise would have little or no audience. Their stories, talent and knowledge would be wasted without a means to share, as nearly 99% of manuscripts are rejected by traditional publishers.  By giving them the support they need to continue
writing and geting their work publicized, we all benefit! </span></p>
<p>Pick from over 10,000 titles and over 50 categories, including Fiction, Romance, and Mystery, and Religion, along with Self-Help, Cooking, Business, and many,
many more. Read anytime, anywhere. Unlimited eBooks are compatible with all
tablets, smartphones , computers and ereaders. New titles are added daily so
there's always plenty of fresh reading entertainment! <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/180213/files/20131106123719-2.jpg?1383770239"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

<p>Our goal is simple – provide readers with an extensive library of
content for their ereading devices and support independent authors by giving them a
platform to distribute their writing around the world. </p>
<p>Unlimited Ebooks provides subscribers with just that - unlimited
ebooks!  Read them on your device of choice - Kindle, Nook, iPad or Phone, PC, and many others. Formats are available for all eeeaders, tablets and smartphones! 
<br/></p>
<p>There's new titles and authors every week added to the 10,000 eBooks you have to choose from today,
including Fiction and Non-Fiction, textbooks and even Children's Stories. We
specialize in promoting new and independent authors. We are seeking funding in
order to publish even more great up-and-coming talent and grow our selection for a continuous stream of new content to download for reading enjoyment.  </p><p><br/></p>

<p>Let's face it, there's a wave of addiction to technology.<span>  How many times a day do we look at our smartphones just to see if there’s a new Facebook post, a new text, or find
what’s in the news?  We want to give
people something else, something more – literacy and a love of reading!  Rather than spend those spare 10 minutes meaninlessly flipping through Facebook, steal a moment with an ebook.  Read a few pages from that classic fiction
novel you've rediscovered, browse some recipes in a tasty cooking ebook, or browse for
new children's tales to enthrall your kids.  </span></p>

<p></p></div>","Unlimited Ebooks gives readers the ability to download as many books as you want from an extensive online library. It's an adventurous alternative to the 'vanilla' flavor of typical traditional publishers. Discover the next bestsellers, rising-star writers & indie authors. Find it all from real & raw to controversial - both fiction and non-fiction. Offering formats for tablets, ereaders, browsers and smartphones to enjoy anytime & anywhere! 
Unlimited Ebooks is part of an initiative to promote reading
and literacy worldwide, created in 2013 by Chris Benjamin. Like free source code in the computing industry, I hope that unlimited content combined with less editorial interference and censorship will increase reading to spark new insights and wisdom worldwide.  At the same time, we're promoting undiscovered & independent authors who otherwise would have little or no audience. Their stories, talent and knowledge would be wasted without a means to share, as nearly 99% of manuscripts are rejected by traditional publishers.  By giving them the support they need to continue
writing and geting their work publicized, we all benefit! 
Pick from over 10,000 titles and over 50 categories, including Fiction, Romance, and Mystery, and Religion, along with Self-Help, Cooking, Business, and many,
many more. Read anytime, anywhere. Unlimited eBooks are compatible with all
tablets, smartphones , computers and ereaders. New titles are added daily so
there's always plenty of fresh reading entertainment! 

Our goal is simple – provide readers with an extensive library of
content for their ereading devices and support independent authors by giving them a
platform to distribute their writing around the world. 
Unlimited Ebooks provides subscribers with just that - unlimited
ebooks!  Read them on your device of choice - Kindle, Nook, iPad or Phone, PC, and many others. Formats are available for all eeeaders, tablets and smartphones! 

There's new titles and authors every week added to the 10,000 eBooks you have to choose from today,
including Fiction and Non-Fiction, textbooks and even Children's Stories. We
specialize in promoting new and independent authors. We are seeking funding in
order to publish even more great up-and-coming talent and grow our selection for a continuous stream of new content to download for reading enjoyment.  

Let's face it, there's a wave of addiction to technology.  How many times a day do we look at our smartphones just to see if there’s a new Facebook post, a new text, or find
what’s in the news?  We want to give
people something else, something more – literacy and a love of reading!  Rather than spend those spare 10 minutes meaninlessly flipping through Facebook, steal a moment with an ebook.  Read a few pages from that classic fiction
novel you've rediscovered, browse some recipes in a tasty cooking ebook, or browse for
new children's tales to enthrall your kids.  



We
need your support to make this a blockbuster endeavor! UnlimitedEbooks.com has been
very fortunate to have loyal supporters.  We launched our Unlimited Ebooks website in June
2013 and
have continued to grow and add content ever since.The next phase, which you are directly impacting with your contribution, is to reach
out to more authors, help them get their ebooks on our site, and, in turn,
provide more amazing content to book lovers everywhere. 
It’s a win for everyone!
While
we have over 10,000 titles currently, your support will accelerate growth to over 100,000
titles by the end of 2014, available to men, women and children worldwide.

<p><b>Le Comité pour les droits humains en Amérique latine
(CDHAL)</b></p>
<p>Le CDHAL est une organisation de solidarité qui
travaille à la défense et la promotion des droits humains en réciprocité avec
les mouvements sociaux et les communautés d'Amérique latine dans la lutte en
faveur d'une justice sociale et environnementale. Notre organisation est
reconnue depuis 35 ans pour sa contribution, sa grande capacité mobilisatrice
et son travail inspiré des pratiques d’éducation populaire auprès des milieux
de la solidarité internationale, communautaire, des milieux étudiants et de la
recherche, de la communauté latino-américaine, et plus généralement du public
québécois. Nos activités d’éducation du public avec les groupes cités ci-haut
contribuent à la systématisation, au partage et à la diffusion de savoirs et
d’expériences militantes. Plusieurs groupes de base et mouvements sociaux
d’Amérique latine ont reçu l’appui du CDHAL. </p>
<p><b>LE PROJET</b></p>
<p><i>Caminando</i> est une revue de réflexion et
d’engagement social qui diffuse depuis 1980 une information alternative sur les
droits humains en Amérique latine. Ses articles portent un regard critique sur
les grands enjeux qui animent la vie politique en Amérique latine, sur les
luttes pour la défense des droits et pour l’autodétermination menées tant par
des communautés latino-américaines que canadiennes, afin de mettre en évidence
les parallèles entre les problématiques du Sud et celles en œuvre au Québec et
au Canada. La revue a un point de vue anticapitaliste, écologiste, féministe et
anticolonialiste.</p>
<p><strong>La prochaine édition, à paraître en octobre 2014,
aura pour thème <i>« Énergie pour qui,
pour quoi? Une analyse critique de notre modèle énergétique»</i>. </strong>Ce
numéro découle d’un projet de sensibilisation et d’engagement sur la question
de l’énergie et de son impact sur les droits humains dans les Amériques. À
travers d’une analyse critique et interdisciplinaire réalisée avec des groupes
communautaires, écologistes et de solidarité internationale, le projet a pour
but de contribuer à la prise de conscience du lien fondamental entre le modèle
énergétique et les droits humains, à partir des perspectives de mouvements
sociaux d’Amérique latine. <i>Soberanía energética: hacia un
modelo energético popular, democrático, justo y ecolog</i>ist<i>a!</i></p>
<p>Donnant une voix à des militant-e-s, à des
défenseur-e-s des droits humains de plusieurs milieux, <i>Caminando</i> revêt un caractère unique en matière d’éducation et
d’engagement du public aux inégalités socioéconomiques et écologiques dans les
Amériques. Elle permet de dénoncer, dans un axe Nord-Sud, les dynamiques de
répression et de criminalisation des défenseur-e-s des droits, l’impunité des
violations des droits humains, le déplacement forcé et la violation des droits
territoriaux, la violence contre les femmes, qui accompagnent l’expansion du
néolibéralisme dans les Amériques. Informons-nous pour défendre les droits
collectifs! <br/></p>
<p>Le processus de conception de <i>Caminando</i> est pensé comme un espace de
coformation pour les personnes qui participent à la rédaction, l’édition et
la publication de la revue.Le CDHAL
mobilise des étudiant-e-s et des militant-e-s pour produire des articles en
équipe, jumelant recherche et engagement. L’équipe de rédaction de la revue se
complète avec un apport de collaborateurs-trices (chercheur-e-s, militant-e-s,
membres de communautés, au Nord comme au Sud) et des responsables des autres
projets du CDHAL. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/893245/files/20140930094431-affiche_soir_e_festive__v3_-_resize_.png?1412095471"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>Les fonds

<strong>

Committee for Human Rights in Latin America (CDHAL)</strong>
<p>The CDHAL is a solidarity organization that works to
defend and promote Human Rights. We work in reciprocity with other social
movements and Latin American communities in the fight for social and
environmental justice. Our organization has been recognized for its 35 years of
significant contributions and for its capacity to mobilize.O<span>ur work is inspired by popular education practices among the international
solidarity community, students, media research, the Latin American
community, and the Quebec public. Our public education activities with the
above mentioned groups contribute to the systematization, sharing and
dissemination of knowledge and campaigning experiences. Several unit groups and
social movements in Latin America have received support from CDHAL.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>THE PROJECT</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Caminando</i>
is a journal of reflection and alternative social engagement broadcasting
information on human rights in Latin America since 1980. Articles take a
critical look at the major issues that take part in the political life in Latin
America, the struggle for defending human rights and the right to self-determination
pursued by Latin American and Canadian communities,<span> in order to highlight and compare problems of the South from
those in Quebec and Canada. The magazine has an anti-capitalist, environmentalist,
feminist and anti-colonialist perspective.</span></p>
<p><strong>The next edition, to be published in October 2014,
will focus on <i>""Energy: for whom, for what? A critical analysis of our
energy </i><i>model.""</i></strong> This publication is the result of<span> an awareness and outreach on the issue of
energy and its impact on human rights in the Americas. Through a critical and
interdisciplinary analysis conducted with the community, environmental groups
and international solidarity, the project aims to contribute to the awareness
of the fundamental relationship between the energy model and human rights, from
the perspectives of social movements in Latin America <i>Soberanía energética:
hacia a modelo energético popular, Democratico y justo ecolog</i>ist<i>a!</i></span></p>
<p>Giving a voice to activists and to defenders of Human
Rights from various backgrounds, <i>Caminando</i> is unique in education and
public engagement with socio-economic and environmental inequalities in the
Americas. It allows denouncing, in a north-south axis, the dynamic of
repression and criminalization of defenders of rights, the impunity for human
rights violations, the forced displacement and violation of territorial rights
and the violence against women. Keep us posted so we can continue to defend collective
rights!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The design process of <i>Caminando</i> is thought of
as an area of co-training for people involved in the writing, editing and
publication of the journal.CDHAL mobilizes students and activists to
produce items as a team, combining research and engagement. The editorial team
of the magazine completes its job with the input from collaborators
(facilitators, researchers, activists, community members, both North and South)
and leaders of other CDHAL projects.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The funds raised
through our online campaign will cover some of the costs of coordinating the
drafting team, graphic design and printing of the magazine. If we exceed our goal,
the funds raised will be used to further develop the draft Caminando.</b></p>
<p><b>CDHAL organizes a festive evening for
the launch of Caminando on October 24th, at 7PM,  at L'Alizé (900 Ontario East, Montreal). </b>Donors will receive tickets to attend, as
well as copies of the magazine.</p><p>To know more about the festive evening: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/799686196718345/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/events/799686196718345/</a></p>

Le Comité pour les droits humains en Amérique latine
(CDHAL)
Le CDHAL est une organisation de solidarité qui
travaille à la défense et la promotion des droits humains en réciprocité avec
les mouvements sociaux et les communautés d'Amérique latine dans la lutte en
faveur d'une justice sociale et environnementale. Notre organisation est
reconnue depuis 35 ans pour sa contribution, sa grande capacité mobilisatrice
et son travail inspiré des pratiques d’éducation populaire auprès des milieux
de la solidarité internationale, communautaire, des milieux étudiants et de la
recherche, de la communauté latino-américaine, et plus généralement du public
québécois. Nos activités d’éducation du public avec les groupes cités ci-haut
contribuent à la systématisation, au partage et à la diffusion de savoirs et
d’expériences militantes. Plusieurs groupes de base et mouvements sociaux
d’Amérique latine ont reçu l’appui du CDHAL. 
LE PROJET
Caminando est une revue de réflexion et
d’engagement social qui diffuse depuis 1980 une information alternative sur les
droits humains en Amérique latine. Ses articles portent un regard critique sur
les grands enjeux qui animent la vie politique en Amérique latine, sur les
luttes pour la défense des droits et pour l’autodétermination menées tant par
des communautés latino-américaines que canadiennes, afin de mettre en évidence
les parallèles entre les problématiques du Sud et celles en œuvre au Québec et
au Canada. La revue a un point de vue anticapitaliste, écologiste, féministe et
anticolonialiste.
La prochaine édition, à paraître en octobre 2014,
aura pour thème « Énergie pour qui,
pour quoi? Une analyse critique de notre modèle énergétique». Ce
numéro découle d’un projet de sensibilisation et d’engagement sur la question
de l’énergie et de son impact sur les droits humains dans les Amériques. À
travers d’une analyse critique et interdisciplinaire réalisée avec des groupes
communautaires, écologistes et de solidarité internationale, le projet a pour
but de contribuer à la prise de conscience du lien fondamental entre le modèle
énergétique et les droits humains, à partir des perspectives de mouvements
sociaux d’Amérique latine. Soberanía energética: hacia un
modelo energético popular, democrático, justo y ecologista!
Donnant une voix à des militant-e-s, à des
défenseur-e-s des droits humains de plusieurs milieux, Caminando revêt un caractère unique en matière d’éducation et
d’engagement du public aux inégalités socioéconomiques et écologiques dans les
Amériques. Elle permet de dénoncer, dans un axe Nord-Sud, les dynamiques de
répression et de criminalisation des défenseur-e-s des droits, l’impunité des
violations des droits humains, le déplacement forcé et la violation des droits
territoriaux, la violence contre les femmes, qui accompagnent l’expansion du
néolibéralisme dans les Amériques. Informons-nous pour défendre les droits
collectifs! 
Le processus de conception de Caminando est pensé comme un espace de
coformation pour les personnes qui participent à la rédaction, l’édition et
la publication de la revue.Le CDHAL
mobilise des étudiant-e-s et des militant-e-s pour produire des articles en
équipe, jumelant recherche et engagement. L’équipe de rédaction de la revue se
complète avec un apport de collaborateurs-trices (chercheur-e-s, militant-e-s,
membres de communautés, au Nord comme au Sud) et des responsables des autres
projets du CDHAL. Les fonds
recueillis grâce au sociofinancement serviront à couvrir une partie des coûts
de coordination de l’équipe de rédaction, le graphisme et l’impression de la
revue. Si notre objectif est dépassé, les fonds amassés serviront à développer
davantage le projet de Caminando. 
Le CDHAL organise une soirée
festive pour le lancement de Caminando le 24 octobre prochain, à 19h, à L’Alizé (900 Ontario Est, Montréal). Les donateurs pourront recevoir des billets pour
cette soirée festive ainsi que des exemplaires de la revue.

Committee for Human Rights in Latin America (CDHAL)
The CDHAL is a solidarity organization that works to
defend and promote Human Rights. We work in reciprocity with other social
movements and Latin American communities in the fight for social and
environmental justice. Our organization has been recognized for its 35 years of
significant contributions and for its capacity to mobilize.Our work is inspired by popular education practices among the international
solidarity community, students, media research, the Latin American
community, and the Quebec public. Our public education activities with the
above mentioned groups contribute to the systematization, sharing and
dissemination of knowledge and campaigning experiences. Several unit groups and
social movements in Latin America have received support from CDHAL.

THE PROJECT

Caminando
is a journal of reflection and alternative social engagement broadcasting
information on human rights in Latin America since 1980. Articles take a
critical look at the major issues that take part in the political life in Latin
America, the struggle for defending human rights and the right to self-determination
pursued by Latin American and Canadian communities, in order to highlight and compare problems of the South from
those in Quebec and Canada. The magazine has an anti-capitalist, environmentalist,
feminist and anti-colonialist perspective.
The next edition, to be published in October 2014,
will focus on ""Energy: for whom, for what? A critical analysis of our
energy model."" This publication is the result of an awareness and outreach on the issue of
energy and its impact on human rights in the Americas. Through a critical and
interdisciplinary analysis conducted with the community, environmental groups
and international solidarity, the project aims to contribute to the awareness
of the fundamental relationship between the energy model and human rights, from
the perspectives of social movements in Latin America Soberanía energética:
hacia a modelo energético popular, Democratico y justo ecologista!
Giving a voice to activists and to defenders of Human
Rights from various backgrounds, Caminando is unique in education and
public engagement with socio-economic and environmental inequalities in the
Americas. It allows denouncing, in a north-south axis, the dynamic of
repression and criminalization of defenders of rights, the impunity for human
rights violations, the forced displacement and violation of territorial rights
and the violence against women. Keep us posted so we can continue to defend collective
rights!

The design process of Caminando is thought of
as an area of co-training for people involved in the writing, editing and
publication of the journal.CDHAL mobilizes students and activists to
produce items as a team, combining research and engagement. The editorial team
of the magazine completes its job with the input from collaborators
(facilitators, researchers, activists, community members, both North and South)
and leaders of other CDHAL projects.

The funds raised
through our online campaign will cover some of the costs of coordinating the
drafting team, graphic design and printing of the magazine. If we exceed our goal,
the funds raised will be used to further develop the draft Caminando.
CDHAL organizes a festive evening for
the launch of Caminando on October 24th, at 7PM,  at L'Alizé (900 Ontario East, Montreal). Donors will receive tickets to attend, as
well as copies of the magazine.To know more about the festive evening: https://www.facebook.com/events/799686196718345/

<p>We live in an unparalleled and historic time for the evolution and growth of Pagan-oriented media, and the development of journalism within our interconnected communities. In the span of a decade we've gone from counting notable self-identified Pagan journalists on one hand, to watching <a href=""http://pagannewswirecollective.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the evolution of a grass-roots Pagan newswire</a> project, and the emergence of a vibrant and unprecedented interview culture thanks to podcasts and Internet radio. I've been truly blessed, through <em><a href=""http://www.patheos.com/blogs/wildhunt/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Wild Hunt</a></em>, to be a participant, booster, and  direct beneficiary of this phenomenon. I've been <a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/PagansAndTheNewMedia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">an ardent evangelizer for the power of new media</a> within our community, and I'm always looking for new ways Pagan journalists and media professionals can do their work in a sustainable manner. </p>
<p>Over the years, I've often been asked if I can cover a certain event, or if I'll be attending a festival or conference. While I wish the answer could always be ""yes,"" I've often been limited in what I could afford to do. While Patheos does pay me something for writing here, it amounts to hundreds of dollars per month, and (sadly) not the high end of ""hundreds."" Simply put, I don't even make minimum wage writing and reporting for the Pagan community on a daily basis.  I don't say this to garner sympathy, but to just plainly state what the fiscal realities are of the current job I perform. Most of the events I cover in person have been possible because the organizers have covered my expenses, or else I sprung for the costs myself. Because of this, whenever an event is too far away, I usually can't go, and instead hope that others will do first-hand accounts that I can build from. </p>
<p>So, starting today, I'm beginning a new experiment in ""crowdfunding"" Pagan journalism. I'm going to start launching small campaigns through <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo</a> to raise travel and living expenses for events that I feel are important for me to cover in person. If the event gets funded, then I go. If it doesn't, I won't. My first campaign is to raise funds for the <a href=""http://www.aarweb.org/Meetings/Annual_Meeting/Current_Meeting/default.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">American Academy of Religion's 2012 Annual Meeting in Chicago</a>. The AAR is the world’s largest association of academics who research or teach topics related to religion, and their annual meeting has become a vital place to hear about the latest scholarship in the field of Pagan Studies (and just about every other religious and philosophical tradition as well). In 2011, my trip to the AAR's Annual Meeting in San Francisco allowed me to <a href=""http://www.patheos.com/blogs/wildhunt/2011/11/aar-day-2-starhawk-on-elemental-theology.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">share a talk by Starhawk on elemental theology</a>, and <a href=""http://www.patheos.com/blogs/wildhunt/2011/11/circling-alone-paganisms-solitary-eclectic-future.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">explore Paganism's solitary, eclectic, future</a>. Not to mention the many connections and sources I was able to meet firsthand. </p>
<p>All of these campaigns will be relatively small-dollar in scope, usually 1-2 thousand dollars for each trip. The amount raised will only cover travel, food, and lodging. Any savings I make due to alternate living/eating/travel arrangements will be forwarded to the next campaign.  I will also take suggestions on events that I should cover and open the idea up to comment here at The Wild Hunt. Should I go to the <a href=""http://esotericbookconference.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Esoteric Book Conference</a> in Seattle? <a href=""http://tcpaganpride.org/paganicon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paganicon</a> in Minnesota? What about an event in England? Make your voices heard, and if there's enough demand, we'll try to fund them one at a time. Ultimately, I would like to build this up and work towards funding a trip to the <a href=""http://www.parliamentofreligions.org/news/index.php/category/2014-parliament/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2014 Parliament of the World's Religions in Belgium</a>.</p>
<p>All trips that are successfully crowdfunded will come with expectations on what I will deliver. Daily reports, yes, but also exclusive audio interviews that I will make freely available for any Pagan media outlet to use, and groundwork for larger, more in depth, stories. Ideally, this project will not only give you more on-the-ground journalism at events that are important to us, but create a model for other Pagans to try as well. If I succeed, it means it can succeed for others like me. In the end, it will mean a richer, more robust, Pagan journalism. I hope you'll join me in this quest, spread the word, donate what you can, and help me in continuing to push the barriers of Pagan media. </p>

we are asking for your help in continuing that trend.
This annual fundraiser is the single biggest factor in determining 
what our operating budget will be for the upcoming year. That means it 
directly effects how many stories and poems we publish.
Your donation will help us pay our writers, artists and web hosts.""From it's inception, I've had the pleasure of illustrating some 
exceptionally fine dark fiction and poetry by name writers as well as those I 
wasn't familiar with.  Many of the authors went on to more fame in the prozines. Ms.

designer. I can't think of any other single publication that offers such a 
variety of dark literature as Niteblade!"" - Marge Simon

forced into one gray amalgam and all fed the same gruel.  Private largesse must
make up for commercial favor.  If you are reading this message, you have some
connection to our struggling small presses.  Lend not only your attention and
emotional support, but some small financial token of your solidarity."" - Ken Poyner""Why should you support Niteblade Magazine?
You will be helping to keep a small press magazine going 
that offers up a superb range of high-quality fiction and poetry for so very 
little cost to the reader that it's practically stealing. Treat yourself to 
an evening of vibrant dreams and twisted nightmares - support Niteblade 
Magazine.
Niteblade Magazine takes an active role in editing the 
stories it accepts, and that is not something you tend to find in small press 
publications - they help the writer to produce a stronger story and the readers 
get better fiction as a result.  I can vouch for the high quality of the editing 
that was done on my story, and for any up-and-coming writers out there, you 
really can learn a lot from a damned good edit."" - Cameron Johnston""In a world of multinationals and 
conglomerates, it's important to keep alive the niche markets and small 
presses that give writers the stepping stones required to build a 
career.  Niteblade is 
exactly that market for the world of dark fantasy and horror.  It is in 
the best sense a labor of love, and readers are the better for it.  And 
who knows?  In perusing Niteblade's pages, you might be face to face with the next Stephen King or Tanith Lee.  Long live small presses!  Please consider contributing to
 Niteblade's fundraising campaign."" - Mark Rigney""Niteblade Magazine is really something special. Rhonda has a keen eye 
for great horror and dark fantasy, and weaves together each issue of 
Niteblade with a wonderful mix of short stories and poems. I was lucky 
enough to have one my first fiction acceptances be at Niteblade, and 
Rhonda's careful editorship brought out the full potential of the tale 
and helped it become what I consider among my strongest stories to date.
 Niteblade is, and will continue to be, a place I am very proud to have 
been a part of. If you haven't yet, sit down with an issue and enjoy. You're in for a good ride."" - Cory Cone""Niteblade was the magazine that first brought my writing into the public
 sphere. It was 2009 and I'd finished my first short story that I 
thought was worthy enough to be published outside of my high school 
literary rag. Even though I thought it was too experimental to find a 
home, when I received Rhonda's kind words of acceptance and praise, I 
couldn't believe my luck. The issue in which my story appears is the 
publication of my career that I cherish the most (I've even framed the 
illustration they drew to accompany my story). Niteblade is more than 
just a platform; it's a community of writers, editors and readers who 
love the craft. They helped me become the writer I am today. This 
magazine deserves its long standing history and legacy and I applaud 
their constant and persistent success in bringing important works and 
words to life."" - Salena Casha",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>So there I was, hairy as could be and trying to figure out how to fit into this world along side all of my bald baby friends so delicately covered in peach fuzz.</p>
<p>And thirty-one years later, so goes the rest of my story of trying to figure out how to fit into a world that I wasn't made for.</p>
<p>I'm still pretty hairy and rough around the edges, but I smell like egyptian musk and blackberry sage when I take the time to clean up. <b>I'm in recovery from being a middle child, a preacher's kid, a co-dependent, a people-pleaser, being mis-understood when I said no the first time, being broken-hearted one too many times, an aggressive eating disorder, an adult child of a dysfunctional family, divorced parents and severe depression</b>, all while coming out victorious after fighting one hell of a fight in December of 2013. Literally, one hell of a fight, as I found myself back in a hospital bed <b>fighting a battle that was not of this world, saved not by the hands of the doctors, but by the utterance of the three most powerful words I would ever come to know… Jesus is Lord.</b></p>
<p>The story of my life cannot be told without these three words.</p>
<p>And so the story goes, giving up the story I used to tell, that every thing was fine, when in reality everything was not; claiming the truth, ugly as it may be; and learning how to live well without excusing myself to settle for anything less than a full life.</p>
<p>I cry hard and laugh often. I love to dance, second only to writing and third only to Jesus. I think the best romance is made up of chocolate and peanut butter, and the best love story belongs to Johnny and June Carter Cash. My mom doesn't know I have four tattoos and this is my way of telling her. I've gone from barista to flight attendant to dog walker to preschool chef to now pursuing that which I love most in life, writing...</p>

<p>It's not the most glamorous life, but I love it. </p>
<p>Thus begins my life at thirty (one). With a lot of baggage and a long road ahead, I've shaken off all the unnecessaries, packed light for the rest of the journey and expressed my desires while surrendering my plans to the only Man I find worth pursuing. I've never been more terrified and more excited in all my life.</p>
<p>I'm showing up for life, again, a little late, but better late than never. Being restless at heart with a seemingly insatiable hunger for travel and desire to follow Jesus no matter how crazy He gets, I have downsized from my studio on a duck pond in Portland, Oregon into a Volkswagen Vanagon in San Diego, California. </p>
<p>Yes, I live in a van... down by the ocean.</p>

<div>
<p>to talk openly and honestly about the things in life that haven't been so easy to be open and honest about... to encourage others to step out of the dark into the light, painful as the light may be, so the healing can begin. </p>
<p>The book is based on my blog, <a href=""https://jenniejoybarrows.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">it's called a spade</a>, where you will find the collection of stories and what they are about...</p>
<p>""This is a collection of stories about life, about people and God, about recovery and relapse, about heartache and brokenness and the reality that life is hard coupled with the fact that there is hope and healing, even if it comes without answers; healing in ways that can’t be prescribed or used as blanket formulas for every heartache, as each cause for heartache is as different as the heart that is aching.</p>
<p>This is a collection of stories from a girl who almost disappeared in her efforts to be seen, a girl who grew up in a culture that called spades hearts and smiled while bluffing. This is a collection of stories from a girl that drops J-bombs and F-bombs, sometimes within the same breath because she fully believes the truth that life is hard and the occasional F-bomb is necessary, just as much as she fully believes that Jesus heals, recovers, revives and restores.</p>
<p><b>This is a collection of stories about calling a spade a spade because the truth will indeed set you free if in no other way than just allowing you to breathe again without the strain of trying to hide all of the ugly and hold the pain in.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>It’s called a spade. It’s not as pretty as the diamond, as lovely as the heart, or as eclectic as the club, but it is what it is, a spade, vulgar and unattractive as it may be, it’s a spade, and merely calling it what it is makes me feel a little less crazy, a little less like I am living a lie. It points up, the spade, because when you start telling the truth, the outcome may be hard at first, even unbearable, but things do start looking up.</p>
<p>For most of my life I have called spades hearts, and I’m tired of bluffing.</p>

<div>
<p>to make it happen. In an effort to live what I preach, or write, I realize that I need to be willing to bring people into the process with me... because that's what I always tell people, that for as difficult as it may be to ask for help, if for no other reason than revealing what you need help with, don't go it alone!</p>
<p>And so <b>I need help to fund the publishing process</b>, in part because I don't have all of the money, let's just go ahead and call that spade, but also in part because I firmly believe in this being <b>a book for any and all people</b>, made possible by any and all people... a community project. I'm not here to convince anyone of anything, not even to believe what I believe, I'm here to tell true stories that involve real people from all walks of life, which is why if any of what I am saying here or over at <a href=""https://jenniejoybarrows.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">it's called a spade</a> jives with you, I'd love for you to be a part of putting the blog into a book and onto a shelve. </p>
<p><b>I love the act of writing and I believe in the power of stories, and though I will blog until my heart stops beating if that is the only medium I am given, I believe in the beauty of ink on paper and the impact it has to change lives if placed in open hands. </b></p>
<p>While I am writing from a Christian perspective, I write about the tough stuff with much more to say than just ""I'll pray for you,"" or ""have more faith,"" words that may have been well intended, but I believe have often caused more harm then help.</p>
<p>Stories include:</p>

</div><div> <p>I am working with WestBow Press, a division of Thomas Nelson and Zondervan, to pursue the self-publishing route.</p>
<p>Per their website, ""WestBow Press is a non-traditional, indie publisher. There are many advantages to indie publishing. You remain in complete control of the finished product because you get to decide what text, images, illustrations, fonts, etc. to use in your book. You retain the rights of your manuscript, unlike a traditional publisher. The timeline from start to finish is much quicker than a traditional publisher, which often takes two or more years to complete.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Additionally, you do not need an agent, eating into potential profits, in order to get your manuscript noticed, accepted and published. Also, unlike traditional publishers who only market their most promising titles, we offer marketing materials and promotional services.""</span><br/></p>
<p><b>I need $7000 to help purchase the publishing package which includes:</b></p>

<p>(included in the total is the 4% that goes to indiegogo, and the 3-5% to third parties, credit card processing and paypal) </p>
<p>AND YOU'LL GET... REWARDS! </p>
<p>I know, I'm visual too, but <b>READ THIS PART!!!</b></p>
<p>I'll be honest, because that's what I do, <b>my rewards are about as grassroots as this campaign.</b> If I had celebrity status stuff to offer you, I would, but alas, I got me and the limited ability to share simple things I love... like books and good music and coffee mugs and art.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Keeping in mind that one shouldn't store up treasures that rot and rust ;) I'm excited to offer non-tradtional, personalized incentives for those who jump on board with this project. I would LOVE to be able to offer so much more, but so as not to ask for more money just so I can reward people, I'm taking a simpler route by offering incentives that have a more personal touch.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Telling the truth is always a risk. Talking about things like addiction and relapse means talking about what happens when you find yourself there, which is never pretty, no matter what the addiction. I hope to share openly about my struggles, as well as how I've been affected by the struggles of others, telling my stories as best as I can while respecting the stories of others. </p>
<p>It's a risk to so fully put myself out there, and there's always fear involved with pursuing a passion, fear it won't happen, fear others won't hop on board, but I fully believe that writing <i>this book</i> is a calling on my life, which means I have to be honest about the life I have lived, in hopes that it will help others.</p>

""Jennie Joy,"" they said when I popped out into the world, naked as they come, and naked I came, except for a head full of hair so thick they called me ""the Russian.""
No joke, the Russian..





So there I was, hairy as could be and trying to figure out how to fit into this world along side all of my bald baby friends so delicately covered in peach fuzz.
And thirty-one years later, so goes the rest of my story of trying to figure out how to fit into a world that I wasn't made for.
I'm still pretty hairy and rough around the edges, but I smell like egyptian musk and blackberry sage when I take the time to clean up. I'm in recovery from being a middle child, a preacher's kid, a co-dependent, a people-pleaser, being mis-understood when I said no the first time, being broken-hearted one too many times, an aggressive eating disorder, an adult child of a dysfunctional family, divorced parents and severe depression, all while coming out victorious after fighting one hell of a fight in December of 2013. Literally, one hell of a fight, as I found myself back in a hospital bed fighting a battle that was not of this world, saved not by the hands of the doctors, but by the utterance of the three most powerful words I would ever come to know… Jesus is Lord.
The story of my life cannot be told without these three words.
And so the story goes, giving up the story I used to tell, that every thing was fine, when in reality everything was not; claiming the truth, ugly as it may be; and learning how to live well without excusing myself to settle for anything less than a full life.
I cry hard and laugh often. I love to dance, second only to writing and third only to Jesus. I think the best romance is made up of chocolate and peanut butter, and the best love story belongs to Johnny and June Carter Cash. My mom doesn't know I have four tattoos and this is my way of telling her. I've gone from barista to flight attendant to dog walker to preschool chef to now pursuing that which I love most in life, writing...


It's not the most glamorous life, but I love it. 
Thus begins my life at thirty (one). With a lot of baggage and a long road ahead, I've shaken off all the unnecessaries, packed light for the rest of the journey and expressed my desires while surrendering my plans to the only Man I find worth pursuing. I've never been more terrified and more excited in all my life.
I'm showing up for life, again, a little late, but better late than never. Being restless at heart with a seemingly insatiable hunger for travel and desire to follow Jesus no matter how crazy He gets, I have downsized from my studio on a duck pond in Portland, Oregon into a Volkswagen Vanagon in San Diego, California. 
Yes, I live in a van... down by the ocean.





Thanks for joining me on this raw and real journey. It's called a spade, and it ain't always pretty, but real life beats all.
And I believe in the power of good stories...



Which is why I want to write (not just a book) this book...

to talk openly and honestly about the things in life that haven't been so easy to be open and honest about... to encourage others to step out of the dark into the light, painful as the light may be, so the healing can begin. 
The book is based on my blog, it's called a spade, where you will find the collection of stories and what they are about...
""This is a collection of stories about life, about people and God, about recovery and relapse, about heartache and brokenness and the reality that life is hard coupled with the fact that there is hope and healing, even if it comes without answers; healing in ways that can’t be prescribed or used as blanket formulas for every heartache, as each cause for heartache is as different as the heart that is aching.
This is a collection of stories from a girl who almost disappeared in her efforts to be seen, a girl who grew up in a culture that called spades hearts and smiled while bluffing. This is a collection of stories from a girl that drops J-bombs and F-bombs, sometimes within the same breath because she fully believes the truth that life is hard and the occasional F-bomb is necessary, just as much as she fully believes that Jesus heals, recovers, revives and restores.
This is a collection of stories about calling a spade a spade because the truth will indeed set you free if in no other way than just allowing you to breathe again without the strain of trying to hide all of the ugly and hold the pain in.


It’s called a spade. It’s not as pretty as the diamond, as lovely as the heart, or as eclectic as the club, but it is what it is, a spade, vulgar and unattractive as it may be, it’s a spade, and merely calling it what it is makes me feel a little less crazy, a little less like I am living a lie. It points up, the spade, because when you start telling the truth, the outcome may be hard at first, even unbearable, but things do start looking up.
For most of my life I have called spades hearts, and I’m tired of bluffing.




My prayer in sharing these stories is for all venom to be removed from my heart as I spit out the truth. I pray for truth in the form of love and for grace upon grace upon grace, for myself and for you.""


Which is why I need your help...

to make it happen. In an effort to live what I preach, or write, I realize that I need to be willing to bring people into the process with me... because that's what I always tell people, that for as difficult as it may be to ask for help, if for no other reason than revealing what you need help with, don't go it alone!
And so I need help to fund the publishing process, in part because I don't have all of the money, let's just go ahead and call that spade, but also in part because I firmly believe in this being a book for any and all people, made possible by any and all people... a community project. I'm not here to convince anyone of anything, not even to believe what I believe, I'm here to tell true stories that involve real people from all walks of life, which is why if any of what I am saying here or over at it's called a spade jives with you, I'd love for you to be a part of putting the blog into a book and onto a shelve. 
I love the act of writing and I believe in the power of stories, and though I will blog until my heart stops beating if that is the only medium I am given, I believe in the beauty of ink on paper and the impact it has to change lives if placed in open hands. 
While I am writing from a Christian perspective, I write about the tough stuff with much more to say than just ""I'll pray for you,"" or ""have more faith,"" words that may have been well intended, but I believe have often caused more harm then help.
Stories include:
Anxiety, Addiction, Depression, Divorce, Dysfunctional Families (my family puts the FUN in dysfunctional), Eating Disorders, Healing, Homelessness, Homosexuality, Hope, Humor, Rehab, Relapse, Relationships, Restoration, Self-Medication, Sex, Spiritual Warfare, Suicide, 


and lots of Jesus.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Shattering Bias In S.T.E.A.M. focuses on the implicit bias women face throughout their professional careers within the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math. Through my book, I aim to create awareness around the prevalence of gender discrimination in S.T.E.A.M. fields.<br/><br/>My name is Poonam Rahman and I am the author of Shattering Bias In S.T.E.A.M. I wrote this book because over the past couple years, I have noticed a significant increase of implicit gender bias and gender discrimination against women in S.T.E.A.M. fields, and I am passionate about upholding and promoting the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion within those fields. I have also always been interested in advocating for the rights of women and empowering them. Last year, I came across a video of two science communicators on Instagram, Samantha Yammine and Sarah Habibi, in which they spoke about the importance of inclusivity in S.T.E.A.M. I found this topic to be incredibly fascinating and decided to do more research. One thing led to another and now I’m writing a book about it!<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover ways through which the environment for women in S.T.E.A.M. fields can become more inclusive. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of S.T.E.A.M. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you create a more inclusive work environment for your female colleagues and counterparts.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll hear interviews and stories from women who have experienced implicit gender bias throughout their professional careers and ways they recommend eradicating the prevalence of this issue.<br/><br/>Some interviewees include...</p>

<p>You will love this book if you enjoy learning about women’s issues in society, historical women in the S.T.E.A.M. field, and would like to know ways through which we can create and promote inclusivity of all genders in the workplace.<br/><br/>Shattering Bias In S.T.E.A.M. is a nonfiction book that speaks to aspiring and current professionals in S.T.E.A.M. fields and S.T.E.A.M. enthusiasts who want to look at gender discrimination in the workplace and women’s empowerment in a new way.</p>
<p>The book is written in three parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the Introduction + Chapter 1-5. This section explores the stories and experiences of women in the careers of science, technology, engineering, the arts, and mathematics. You will have the opportunity to learn how implicit gender bias has evolved and ways that we can eradicate this issue.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 6-10. This section highlights the insights and experiences of men regarding the topic of implicit gender bias and gender discrimination. You will be able to gain a different perspective on this issue and explore ways to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in male-dominated and S.T.E.A.M. workplaces.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 </strong>contains the Conclusion + Chapters 11-14. This section highlights the perspectives of teachers on this topic. Gender discrimination is known to be instilled within children during their developmental stages of schooling. You will get to explore the factors that are deeply rooted in implicit gender bias and gender discrimination through the perspectives of elementary, middle, and high school teachers.<br/> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><em>Alafia</em>, peace. I am Khafre K. Abif, an AIDS activist thriving with HIV for 23 years.  I have compiled an anthology of inspirational prayers, poems, and affirmations to support the souls and uplift the spirits of people living with HIV/AIDS. For the last 20 months these submissions have touched my soul, made me cry, filled me with hope, and connected me to an international community of compassionate contributors sharing their work to empower my world.  <strong><em>Your sponsorship will bring healing words to those infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS.</em></strong></p>
<p>I believe prayer heals.  I know words have power.  I provide this collection to combat the words so often spoken to those with HIV.  This is my effort to fight HIV-related stigma, the prejudice, negative attitudes, abuse, and maltreatment directed at people living with HIV and AIDS. The consequences of stigma and discrimination are wide-ranging: being shunned by family, peers, and the wider community, poor treatment in healthcare and educational settings, an erosion of rights, psychological damage, and a negative effect on HIV testing and treatment. The idea for the anthology grew out of my work as an HIV Test Counselor.  Each time I had to tell someone they tested positive for HIV, one of their first concerns was disclosure.  This anthology aims to help them through an entire book of encouragement. </p>
<p><strong><em>Cornbread, Fish and Collard Greens: Prayers, Poems &amp; Affirmation for People Living with HIV/AIDS</em></strong> has received submissions from Africa, Europe, South America, and the United States. Some contributors have even provided their work in their indigenous languages with English translations. I want to share this anthology with the international community who created it.  You, the reader may very well know someone living with HIV/AIDS. If you do, then they have shared their status with you.  Consider all who still haven’t disclosed to their mothers, fathers, sisters/brothers, or even their faith communities.  Where do they go for support and inspiration?  I use this anthology to encourage those in the shadows to come into the light. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your <strong>sponsorship</strong> will support the cost of self-publishing this anthology project, delivering a high-quality, eco-friendly printing of <strong><em>Cornbread, Fish and Collard Greens: Prayers, Poems &amp; Affirmations for People Living with HIV/AIDS</em></strong><em>. </em>In addition, sponsorship will also fund our cover art contract with award-winning illustrator, Javaka Steptoe.</p>
<p>For your Giving Backsponsorship of <strong>$50</strong> you will receive a thank-you on the project website, and I will donate one copy of the book to an AIDS Service Organization in your city.  For your Name in Print sponsorship of <strong>$250</strong>, we will include your name in the acknowledgments of the anthology.   For <strong>$500</strong>, we will arrange a Skype reading and discussion for you and your friends and community.  And for your sponsorship of<strong> $1,000</strong>, I will travel to your city to share my story of living with HIV for 24 years—and you can host a private book signing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your sponsorship will provide new voices to the long-silent AIDS story. It will provide hope, strength, and words that affirm, heal, and lift those who are infected and so often  marginalized —commercial sex workers, substance users, and gay people, especially those too afraid to share that they are gay with their families and churches, much less that they are living with HIV. </p>
<p>Your sponsorship will ensure this anthology is presented in the spirit in which it has been compiled, a quilt of words that heal and affirm the soul. You will ensure the delivery of an aesthetically attractive book that is produced, designed and printed on quality paper.  Sponsorship will ensure each contributor in the United States and beyond receives one free copy. </p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Poets featured in the forthcoming anthology include: <strong>Nikki Grimes, Serena T. Wills, Reginald T. Jackson, Sharaledon D.

<p><i>Welcome to The Outer Dark on This Is Horror. I’m your host Scott Nicolay bringing you news and interviews with the creative talents who operate far beyond the edge of the firelight. There Are Weird Things Out Here, My Friends…</i></p>
<p>When I conceived <a href=""http://theouterdark.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>The Outer Dark</strong> <strong>podcast</strong></a> in 2015, I never expected it to take off like it has and to mean so much to listeners. As the tendrils of the Weird spread further into speculative and even mainstream fiction, film and TV, people kept asking me when we were going to do something more hands-on. Thus was born T<strong>he Outer Dark Symposium on the Greater Weird</strong>.</p>
<p>The inaugural <strong>The Outer Dark Symposium 2017</strong> in Atlanta confirmed that the Weird fiction community felt a burning desire for this kind of conversation and community-building. We were humbled to assemble a blockbuster line-up of contemporary Weird writers, as well as include key members of the African American spec-lit community. Everyone kept saying we had to do this again! So, in 2018, we took the symposium West and dreamed bigger with a truly Weird location, the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, right on the heels of the Winchester movie!</p>
<p>ALL this only happened because you supported us, allowing us to share it with the whole Weird world on our host network <a href=""https://www.thisishorror.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>This Is Horror</strong></a>. If you haven’t checked it, you can find all our 2017 and 2018 symposium episodes at <a href=""http://www.theouterdark.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.theouterdark.com</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This year we’re beyond excited to welcome our largest line-up yet, 40 of the most dynamic authors, editors, artists, publishers, and scholars in Weird fiction today. As with The Outer Dark podcast, our goal is to foster conversation and community among a diverse slate of program participants--inclusive, safe and welcoming to women, LBGTQ+, and writers of color. Returning to Atlanta allows us again to involve <a href=""https://www.blacktasticon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>SOBSF/BlacktastiCon</strong></a> organizers <strong>Milton Davis</strong> and <strong>Balogun Ojetade</strong>. And sponsor support from <strong>Silvia Moreno-Garcia</strong>'s <a href=""http://www.innsmouthfreepress.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Innsmouth Free Press</strong></a> is helping us bring Mexican author <a href=""http://suenodeenero.blogspot.com/p/quien-es-esta.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Gabriela Damiá</strong><strong>n Miravete</strong></a>.</p>
<p>As for our 2019 location, it’s ALL about the love of Weird monsters! <strong>Silver Scream FX Lab</strong> is a floor-to-ceiling funhouse featuring both a special effects make-up/props/costume studio and an extensive Retro movie monster museum. At Silver Scream, <strong>Shane Morton</strong> and his team designed and created the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNjlVy_ljlQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Cheddar Goblin</strong></a> for the crazed <strong>Nicholas Cage</strong> cult hit <i><strong>Mandy</strong></i> (2018), as well as work for <strong>AdultSwim</strong>'s <strong><i>Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell</i></strong>, <i><strong>Too Many Cooks</strong></i>, &amp; more. Shane will be leading an exclusive behind-the-scenes tour and treating attendees to a one-of-a-kind live magic performance emceed by <strong>Professor Morte</strong>, ""The Ghost Host with the Most"" of Atlanta’s popular <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SilverScreamSpookShowATL/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Silver Scream Spook Show</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A key goal remains to keep the symposium immersive, intimate, and budget-responsible. Keeping to the same feasible model that worked well for the previous two symposiums, attendance is limited to 75 memberships and a few hardworking volunteers. Everyone attends all panels and readings and shares breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as welcome and author signing receptions and social activities to continue the conversation into the night. However, we couldn’t assemble such an amazing line-up of program participants for you to hear on the podcast without providing air, hotel, and membership assistance to some guests, as well as covering lodging and meals for our hardworking volunteers. We could increase membership rates, but they are already $100, and we personally think that’s high even though it barely covers space rental, catering, audio equipment, badge printing/laminating and other basic event expenses. We could double our attendance, and we may consider the latter for next year, but that would risk compromising the intimacy that makes the symposium unique on the spec-lit convention circuit and mean paying more for a larger venue.</p>
<p>So instead we are humbly again reaching out to you, It takes a Weird village to make something Weird and extraordinary happen. The only way we have been able to do this for the past two years is through a combination of memberships, sponsorships, and crowdsourcing, i.e. Indiegogo campaigns. Our hope always is to simply break even and keep this happening as an annual event (we’ve already got some amazing guests lining up to attend in 2020!). If by any unlikely chance, we do make any more than we need, that money will go straight back into seeding next year's symposium.</p>
<p>Through this Indiegogo campaign, you can both help sustain the symposium and receive rewards. ALL supporters receive a <strong>The Outer Dark sticker</strong> and <strong>ALL $20 and up</strong> perks include a bonus ebook of <a href=""http://pseudopod.org/year10/for-mortal-things-unsung/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>For Mortal Things Unsung</strong></i></a>, <strong>Pseudopod's</strong> 10th anniversary anthology featuring stories by <strong>Orrin Grey, Damien Angelica Walters, Livia Llewellyn, Joe R.

Welcome to The Outer Dark on This Is Horror. I’m your host Scott Nicolay bringing you news and interviews with the creative talents who operate far beyond the edge of the firelight. There Are Weird Things Out Here, My Friends…

<p><strong>Do you know that just writing a little bit every day will give you a novel within a year? Have you ever thought you would like to write a novel but you don’t have time? </strong></p>
<p>As the organiser of Novel London, I have worked with over 70 novelists to promote fresh fiction. For three years, we had a monthly novelist reading in various central London bookshops and venues. We will be back next year with a weekend Literature festival but in the meantime, I have been working on a special journal for novelists. Each page is a different chapter and you can use it to write your thoughts from the day, plan and reach your goals or write your story your way, every single day! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This beautifully crafted journal is not like any other on the market. It may the the size of an average novel, but there is nothing average about the stories you can write in it. It looks, feels and even smells like a novel. There are pages at the front for you to plan your story, write character profiles or your plot and at the back there are more pages for notes.</p>
<p><strong>What story will you tell in 2019?  </strong></p>
<p>This campaign is very important to me because I have met countless people who want to write a book who believe they do not have the time. But you know what they say – if you can see it, you can achieve. So get writing in the first Novel London Journal. Let me know how you get along!</p>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will allow you to preorder this unique journal and write like a pro! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There is a minimum target we need to reach in order to cover the costs of the printing of a batch of journals. The more journals we print, the cheaper the price. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542421634/l3oww90vg2cz7ogorfsp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The interior has been designed, the cover has three options and all we need is the cost of the printing to be covered and we will give the printer the go-ahead to print the first 100 copies. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542060604/fxrzmxymx3gwn1j01jbc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Back Story </h3>
<p>As a novelist and event organiser, I understand the importance of having a structure for which you can write or fulfil your dream.  My own debut novel took way too long to write but I wrote it and published it and it was an experience that I have shared with many people. </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542345622/rusbxuf4q8nb5l5w3xzr.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is my pleasure to have worked with over 70 novelists to promote their work on social media. Here is just a few of them...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542345783/fve3hghelpmsud9b9g6z.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only risk is not receiving the full amount to cover the cost of production. As soon as we reach the minimum target, the printers will take three days to print and the journals will be dispatched as soon as we receive them. The timeline is tight but all things are ready and set to produce. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute, please get the word out for this campaign and share on Facebook, Twitter and email. </p>
<p>Someone’s story may depend on it!</p>

</div></div>","Do you know that just writing a little bit every day will give you a novel within a year? Have you ever thought you would like to write a novel but you don’t have time? 
As the organiser of Novel London, I have worked with over 70 novelists to promote fresh fiction. For three years, we had a monthly novelist reading in various central London bookshops and venues. We will be back next year with a weekend Literature festival but in the meantime, I have been working on a special journal for novelists. Each page is a different chapter and you can use it to write your thoughts from the day, plan and reach your goals or write your story your way, every single day! 
 
This beautifully crafted journal is not like any other on the market. It may the the size of an average novel, but there is nothing average about the stories you can write in it. It looks, feels and even smells like a novel. There are pages at the front for you to plan your story, write character profiles or your plot and at the back there are more pages for notes.
What story will you tell in 2019?  
This campaign is very important to me because I have met countless people who want to write a book who believe they do not have the time. But you know what they say – if you can see it, you can achieve. So get writing in the first Novel London Journal. Let me know how you get along!
Your contribution to this campaign will allow you to preorder this unique journal and write like a pro! 

What We Need & What You Get
There is a minimum target we need to reach in order to cover the costs of the printing of a batch of journals. The more journals we print, the cheaper the price. 

The interior has been designed, the cover has three options and all we need is the cost of the printing to be covered and we will give the printer the go-ahead to print the first 100 copies. 

The Impact


 
The Back Story 
As a novelist and event organiser, I understand the importance of having a structure for which you can write or fulfil your dream.  My own debut novel took way too long to write but I wrote it and published it and it was an experience that I have shared with many people. 

 
Risks & Challenges
It is my pleasure to have worked with over 70 novelists to promote their work on social media. Here is just a few of them...



Risks & Challenges
The only risk is not receiving the full amount to cover the cost of production. As soon as we reach the minimum target, the printers will take three days to print and the journals will be dispatched as soon as we receive them. The timeline is tight but all things are ready and set to produce. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot contribute, please get the word out for this campaign and share on Facebook, Twitter and email. 
Someone’s story may depend on it!
And please don’t forget, you can use the Indiegogo share tools!

<h3>How Fighter Became a Peacemaker</h3>
<p>I was born with a fiery temperament. As a child and youngster I constantly ended up in physical fights. As an adult I was not involved in physical fights but I always seemed to be surrounded by verbal fighting and people betraying me in various ways.</p>
<p>I moved many times and were involved in many kinds of social groups but the pattern was always the same. I would get in never-ending clashes within the group and especially with any ""enemies"" of the group. I also fought with my spouses and family members. I got even released from military service with a psychiatrists statement for being too risky personality. And I had served only for three days.</p>
<p>I always blamed others for my clashes. If they would change the world would be a better place. All this time I had also suffered from generalized anxiety disorder, recurring depression and several addictions: alcohol, drugs, games and sex to mention a few. When I finally went to see a psychiatrist psychotherapy and the drugs I was prescribed helped me next to nothing. And I was still blaming others for everything.</p>
<p>Few years ago when I had three total breakdowns within a year, I decided that I cannot live like that anymore. For the first time I was determined to heal myself for good. I had read self-help literature before but hadn't really done anything to change my behavior. Now I started to really follow the footsteps of people who had walked on Earth before me. I combined thousands of years of wisdom with modern human sciences and found my path towards the top of the mountains. Now I want to share this wisdom and ease your path, that you wouldn't have to trudge in deep snow as we say in Finland.</p>
<p>My intention is not only to help only You but the whole human kind. I honestly believe that a world without wars or everyday clashes between people is possible. That might not happen during my lifetime, but I do care too much for humanity to let that slow me down.</p>
<p>You Are Humanity is an ongoing project for peace within and in the world. The book is only the first part of it. The first seed that will someday become a wast tree. Please give me your hand. We can make this together!</p>
<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>I am 38 year old passionate global activist. I have studied philosophy, sociology and cultural anthropology academically. I have worked both voluntarily and professionally in many non-profit organizations and in social and political campaigns. My other professions have included working as journalist, columnist, graphic designer and psychiatric nurse.</p>
<h3>The Budget</h3>
<p>The writing process of the book has been going on already for a year. I have already material for a hundred pages. I just need few more months to finish the book. I need the money to pay the rent and feed myself and my two children during the rest of the writing process. The book will be published one day anyways, but the more money is raised, the sooner it will be published. Some of the money will of course be spend on the printing and posting of the books but the exact amount depends on the perks chosen. Any excess of the goal will be spent in marketing the book and starting next phases of You Are Humanity project. Every dollar is one step towards world peace.</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Malangost </strong>es una de esas novelas que profundizan en las miserias de la naturaleza humana, generando esa misma sensación hipnótica de presenciar un naufragio... sin duda, un libro que no deja indiferente.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Dos personajes ficticios, ubicados en la Barcelona de los años previos a la guerra española, se mezclan e interaccionan con una serie de personajes (algunos auténticos y otros inventados), en el desarrollo de una trama de acontecimientos reales que condicionaron poderosamente todos los hechos que sucederán en la España de 1936, y que abrieron el camino a la confrontación.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Con ese dúctil hilo conductor, el relato narra la confluencia temporal y casual de dos seres situados en el declive de sus respectivas trayectorias vitales, que se embarcan por separado en un mismo viaje en busca de una oportunidad para reorientar sus vidas. Ambos contribuirán, sin proponérselo, a la recuperación de la dignidad y la identidad de toda una etnia, poniendo al descubierto las vergüenzas de una política colonial ―la española― que con sus leyes y normas sociales protegía y fomentaba una forma de explotación racial, todavía vigente en el segundo tercio del siglo XX.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>Ángel Luis de Sousa</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Ha tardado mucho tiempo ―quizás demasiado, según él― en descubrir cuánto puede llegar a disfrutar poniendo en palabras aquellas  historias que bullen en su cabeza, sin cuestionarse cómo, porqué o para quién.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Arquitecto de formación, restaurador de monumentos por vocación y gestor de proyectos culturales por el devenir del tiempo, toda su actividad y su experiencia en el campo literario se limitaba, hasta 2016, a un puñado de artículos y publicaciones de marcado contenido técnico en revistas especializadas, y varias coautorías de libros monográficos.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">En ese año Tandaia publicó <i>La oscuridad de la razón</i>, su primera incursión en un terreno distinto al habitual. Un thriller político que plantea dilemas sociológicos y éticos aún hoy sin resolver. Ahora, con este nuevo relato, <i>Malangost</i>, el autor continúa en esa línea oscura, y vuelve a barnizar de ficción un hecho real que puso fin al bienio Radical-Cedista de la Segunda República.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">«Ese verano de 1935 era especialmente caluroso en Barcelona y la altísima humedad del ambiente hacía más difícil soportarlo. En la sofocante noche, la figura aún esbelta de María de Lucena —en realidad Encarnación Romero—, caminaba fumando con cierta elegancia y mucha dignidad por la acera Norte de la Avenida del <i>Paral-lel</i>, camino de su pensión en el Carrer de Tapioles.<br/>          A sus treinta y cuatro años la carrera artística de María de Lucena agonizaba sin remedio ni esperanza. Apenas ocho años atrás estaba actuando en los mejores teatros de esa calle, como el Victoria, el Apolo o el Condal, pero el mundo del espectáculo en la avenida era tan dinámico y tan exigente que generaba una competencia feroz, y la renovación de las carteleras era constante. Además, Evaristo Mediavilla, su representante borrachín y putero, no supo administrar ese éxito inicial y después de tres o cuatro años en la cumbre, comenzó el descenso hacia los teatros de segunda como el Molino o el Arnau, para acabar finalmente en los cabarets de las callejuelas»</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">«Lucas Mumbrú, más conocido como <i>Malangost,</i> era un personaje respetado y temido a partes iguales, tanto en el <i>Poble Sec</i> como en el Raval, es decir, a ambos lados del <i>Paral-lel</i>. A pesar de su mediana edad era ya una leyenda urbana en cuyo currículo figuraban más hechos delictivos ficticios que reales pero que, en cualquier caso, dibujaban un perfil humano frío e implacable, aunque equilibrado y a su modo legal, que despertaba una extraña simpatía entre el vecindario como suele ocurrir con los capos de la mafia calabresa.<br/>          Nadie maltrataba a sus putas y nadie mangoneaba con su mercancía de estraperlo. Incluso la policía local prefería dejarle en paz y no meter las narices en sus asuntos que, por otra parte, se desarrollaban con absoluta discreción en medio de la complicidad del vecindario. Vivía sin agobios económicos, pero con austeridad. No se le conocía pareja, ni amigos, aunque en una parte de su leyenda se mencionaba que en otros tiempos hubo una mujer, tan hermosa como infiel, por la que tuvo que acuchillar a un hombre y huir al destierro»</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 920€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <i>Malangost</i> que saldría después a la venta.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><u>Aviso para navegantes</u>: La opción RESPALDAR es únicamente para realizar donaciones a la edición, por lo que no habrá comunicaciones posteriores en busca de datos de envío... cualquiera de las opciones válidas de reserva exige cumplimentar formulario para haceros llegar el pedido.</i></p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Ángel Luis de Sousa</strong> vea publicada su obra.</p>
<p>Gracias por vuestro tiempo.</p>

Dos personajes ficticios, ubicados en la Barcelona de los años previos a la guerra española, se mezclan e interaccionan con una serie de personajes (algunos auténticos y otros inventados), en el desarrollo de una trama de acontecimientos reales que condicionaron poderosamente todos los hechos que sucederán en la España de 1936, y que abrieron el camino a la confrontación.
Con ese dúctil hilo conductor, el relato narra la confluencia temporal y casual de dos seres situados en el declive de sus respectivas trayectorias vitales, que se embarcan por separado en un mismo viaje en busca de una oportunidad para reorientar sus vidas. Ambos contribuirán, sin proponérselo, a la recuperación de la dignidad y la identidad de toda una etnia, poniendo al descubierto las vergüenzas de una política colonial ―la española― que con sus leyes y normas sociales protegía y fomentaba una forma de explotación racial, todavía vigente en el segundo tercio del siglo XX.
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy te presentamos a Ángel Luis de Sousa.
Ha tardado mucho tiempo ―quizás demasiado, según él― en descubrir cuánto puede llegar a disfrutar poniendo en palabras aquellas  historias que bullen en su cabeza, sin cuestionarse cómo, porqué o para quién.
Arquitecto de formación, restaurador de monumentos por vocación y gestor de proyectos culturales por el devenir del tiempo, toda su actividad y su experiencia en el campo literario se limitaba, hasta 2016, a un puñado de artículos y publicaciones de marcado contenido técnico en revistas especializadas, y varias coautorías de libros monográficos.
En ese año Tandaia publicó La oscuridad de la razón, su primera incursión en un terreno distinto al habitual. Un thriller político que plantea dilemas sociológicos y éticos aún hoy sin resolver. Ahora, con este nuevo relato, Malangost, el autor continúa en esa línea oscura, y vuelve a barnizar de ficción un hecho real que puso fin al bienio Radical-Cedista de la Segunda República.
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«Ese verano de 1935 era especialmente caluroso en Barcelona y la altísima humedad del ambiente hacía más difícil soportarlo. En la sofocante noche, la figura aún esbelta de María de Lucena —en realidad Encarnación Romero—, caminaba fumando con cierta elegancia y mucha dignidad por la acera Norte de la Avenida del Paral-lel, camino de su pensión en el Carrer de Tapioles.          A sus treinta y cuatro años la carrera artística de María de Lucena agonizaba sin remedio ni esperanza. Apenas ocho años atrás estaba actuando en los mejores teatros de esa calle, como el Victoria, el Apolo o el Condal, pero el mundo del espectáculo en la avenida era tan dinámico y tan exigente que generaba una competencia feroz, y la renovación de las carteleras era constante. Además, Evaristo Mediavilla, su representante borrachín y putero, no supo administrar ese éxito inicial y después de tres o cuatro años en la cumbre, comenzó el descenso hacia los teatros de segunda como el Molino o el Arnau, para acabar finalmente en los cabarets de las callejuelas»
«Lucas Mumbrú, más conocido como Malangost, era un personaje respetado y temido a partes iguales, tanto en el Poble Sec como en el Raval, es decir, a ambos lados del Paral-lel. A pesar de su mediana edad era ya una leyenda urbana en cuyo currículo figuraban más hechos delictivos ficticios que reales pero que, en cualquier caso, dibujaban un perfil humano frío e implacable, aunque equilibrado y a su modo legal, que despertaba una extraña simpatía entre el vecindario como suele ocurrir con los capos de la mafia calabresa.          Nadie maltrataba a sus putas y nadie mangoneaba con su mercancía de estraperlo. Incluso la policía local prefería dejarle en paz y no meter las narices en sus asuntos que, por otra parte, se desarrollaban con absoluta discreción en medio de la complicidad del vecindario. Vivía sin agobios económicos, pero con austeridad. No se le conocía pareja, ni amigos, aunque en una parte de su leyenda se mencionaba que en otros tiempos hubo una mujer, tan hermosa como infiel, por la que tuvo que acuchillar a un hombre y huir al destierro»
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 920€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de Malangost que saldría después a la venta.
Aviso para navegantes: La opción RESPALDAR es únicamente para realizar donaciones a la edición, por lo que no habrá comunicaciones posteriores en busca de datos de envío... cualquiera de las opciones válidas de reserva exige cumplimentar formulario para haceros llegar el pedido.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Ángel Luis de Sousa vea publicada su obra.
Gracias por vuestro tiempo.

<p> </p>

<h3>The Story of My Book</h3>
<p>We’re not yet facing killer androids, mind-reading algorithms, or hyperintelligent cyborgs, but technology is growing at an exponential rate. And because rampant exploitation of technology can be detrimental to mankind itself, ethical consciousness—being sensible about what technology can and should be able to do--has become one of the most debated discourses of the 21st century.<br/><br/>My name is Zay and my book <i>Codes and Kingdoms</i> explores the theme of ethical consciousness behind the use of emerging technologies within the government ecosystem.<br/><br/>The mission of this book is to support the cause of ethical technology by encouraging academia and professionals in emerging technology fields to actively champion for social responsibility, justice and equity.<br/><br/>Through interviews, research, and storytelling, you will meet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iain Cruickshank, a data scientist with the U.S Army actively involved within the intersectionality of AI and society</li>
<li>Chris Piehota, an internationally recognized security leader who spent 24 years with the FBI</li>
<li>Emmanuel Goffi, a world-class AI Philosopher from France breaking ground in the area of culture and AI</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>I hope this book will provide a tool to help readers gain a better understanding of what ethical technology means and how they can advocate for more socially conscious technology.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are passionate about responsible technology and curious about how modern technology can be optimized to be more inclusive, impartial, and equitable to our society.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book - <i>Codes and Kingdoms</i>
</h3>
<p>Codes and Kingdoms is a non-fiction book written in three parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 : Justice System<br/><br/>Part 1 examines the policing infrastructure in the US and the integration of emerging technologies like predictive policing and policing robotics in law enforcement operations. This part of the book also explores the court decision making process enabled by artificial intelligence and its sub-branches like NLP and machine learning as well as the ethical complexities of using digital evidence for prosecution purposes. And last but not least, this part will introduce the readers to the American correctional institutions and penitentiary system and to the technologies used to solve issues like recidivism, mass incarceration, and inhumane treatment of inmates.<br/><br/>Part 2 : War and Defense<br/><br/>In Part 2, we’ll delve into the deployment of autonomous systems for combatant missions, Internet of Military Things (IoMT) to enhance the soldier welfare and awareness in the battlefield, and the use of predictive analytics for mission success. This part will also focus on the use of machine learning and data science for veteran health monitoring and immersive media like AR and VR for PTSD treatment. We’ll evaluate government initiatives for veteran welfare, such as REACH Vet. Last but not least, this part assesses the cyberspace as the new domain for international warfare. Security risks, threats and vulnerabilities common within the cyberspace as well as the appropriate countermeasures are discussed.<br/><br/>Part 3 : Politics<br/><br/>Part 3 shines a light on modern electoral and data backed policymaking processes in the federal government system. In this part, we’ll examine the use of big data and blockchain technologies and assess their impacts on misinformation and voter fraud issues. Major incidents in the history of election that involve big data and artificial intelligence are dissected to explain how political advertising and campaigns can benefit from mass data collection.</p>

<h3><strong>What is the project?</strong></h3>
<p><i>becoming-Botanical</i> is a long-term antidisciplinary project aiming to investigate and re-imagine the human/plant relationship with a view towards a sustainable future. We believe that new experiences with and deeper understanding of nonhuman life garners an ecocentric and empathetic perspective crucial to living sustainably in a shifting climate.</p>
<p>Central to the first phase of <i>becoming-Botanical</i> is the curation and publication of an herbal encyclopaedia (<i>liber herbalis</i>) which asks contributors and readers to contemplate in what ways we interact and depend on plant-life in a post-modern era and what future interactions and dependencies may be. The book will comprise a selection of short provocative entries from practitioners of a myriad of scientific and artistic disciplines, accompanied by found, submitted and illustrated visual imagery to disrupt, contradict, or compliment the entries. It is imagined that this collection of disparate ideas can act as a catalyst for creative thinking and artistic practice in the widening field of sustainability and performance ecologies.</p>
<p>The book features 46 entries from over 50 international artists, researchers and practitioners spanning 6 continents--beautifully fusing academia, scientific and ecological research, art, and creative practice. </p>
<p><strong>The book is edited by:</strong></p>

<h3><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Who is the publisher?</strong></h3>
<p>Objet-a Creative Studio is a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (SCIO) committed to producing high-quality interdisciplinary contemporary artworks which celebrate 'otherness' and reach diverse audiences. The work of Artistic Director, Josh Armstrong, has long been rooted in an implicit ecological imperative fostered by the 'deep ecology' movement and the participatory learning of the Natural Change process. This publication is a first for the organisation--a crucial moment in the trajectory of Objet-a to give voice and visibility to a range of diverse persons as they discuss matters which lie in the core of their being. This series ""becoming-"" aims to position the human as a permeable body in an ever-expanding ecology of material, thought and action. Josh Armstrong has internationally produced and presented interdisciplinary performance works at the intersection of music, theatre, and visual art spanning a ten-year career. Transferring these skills to the curation and design of a publication is an exciting foray to reach new audiences. </p>
<p>This work has been supported by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, The University of Wisconsin-Madison, and The University of California Santa Cruz but the funds needed for the printing is outstanding.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><i>We began this project imagining we would publish a 28 page pamphlet of a few essays. After being overwhelmed with positive responses and contributions we realised that this project needs the attention, space, and resource to present a fully curated creative research publication.

<p><strong>With the help of your funding, we will be able to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>print 500 units of the book;</p></li>
<li><p>mail a free copy of the book to each of the contributors who have volunteered their work, labour, and time to their entries for the publication;</p></li>
<li>purchase a pack of 10 ISBNs, which are necessary to be able to have the publication internationally catalogued and sold. This also enables recognition for Objet-a Creative Studio as a publishing body, which is vital for the future plans of the organisation and the publication series.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note: <i>A free digital version will be made available to view online in an effort to increase access to the work. </i></p>
<p>We are not planning to make a profit from the sale of these publications. Our aim is to cover the costs associated with the printing and distribution of the books. Any and all profit will be invested into Objet-a Creative Studio towards the next publication anticipated in 2021.</p>

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p>UPDATE:<strong> I am DONATING 15% of my proceeds to Girls Inc. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></p>
<p>- Why am I allocating 15% of my proceeds to Girls Inc.?</p>
<p>I have been volunteering and mentoring k-12 girls for the past 2 years through Girls Inc. I have learned so much from every single of my girls and they inspire me everyday. I want to support the mission of Girls Inc. encouraging girls to be “Strong, Smart, and Bold.” </p>
<p>- Are you only allocating 15% of the proceeds during the presale campaign?</p>
<p>No, I will continue allocating 15% of the proceeds to Girls Inc. even post launch date on April 2021. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everyone who buys or contributes to my book will also be contributing to girls in Girls Inc. </p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>My name is Zahra Mesrizadeh and I am the author of <i>The God of the Gaps: Understanding Science through the Lens of Religion and Politics</i>. I wrote this book because I want to unfold the history of religion &amp; politics and delve into how it conflicts with the scientific world. Since our pre-wired brains are prone to filling in the gaps to make sense of the world, there's much to discuss. The ultimate goal of my book is to educate my audience about our differences and turn them into our superpower. <br/><br/><i>The God of the Gaps: Understanding Science through the Lens of Religion and Politics: </i>The goal of my book is to explore science in the multi-dimensional reality of society through the lens of history, politics, and religion, and to help us understand the reality of the world in the post-truth era by acknowledging our cognitive barriers. My book will touch on the above subjects by uncovering how historical events, religion, and politics have influenced the interpretation of science, and how we can learn from and overcome these barriers as a society.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how widespread uncertainties are and how we can utilize that to understand our world instead of filling the gaps with temporary answers. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with science communication and escape from the homogeneous theme of our lives.<br/><br/><strong>FOR ALL: </strong><br/>You will love this book if you are struggling with connecting different facets of identity, want to be surprised by common myths you might believe or are scared of conversation about science, religion, and politics in your circle.<br/><br/><i>The God of the Gaps: Understanding Science through the Lens of Religion and Politics </i>speaks to young college students and anyone who want to find joy and hope in science and its relatability to our everyday life and feel comfortable to talk about our affiliations in religion and politics in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>The God of the Gaps: Understanding Science through the Lens of religion and politics</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are my own cognitive biases and their reflection on my thoughts?</li>
<li>How can we improve our circle to engage with diverse thoughts?</li>
<li>How can we better navigate society especially in times like a global pandemic?</li>
</ul>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing science, religion, and politics will change us all for the better. <br/> <h3><i>The God of the Gaps: Understanding Science through the Lens of religion and politics</i></h3>
<p>The book is written in [3] parts.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the author’s note + <br/>        How we got here</p>
<p>        History of religion... how it was created to fill in gaps</p>
<p>        History of conflicts about religion and science</p>
<p>        Science of the human mind (why we tell stories to fill in gaps)</p>
<p><strong>Why Now:</strong> </p>
<p>With the gap between science and society growing larger by the day, it's important we face the issue head-on and examine its origin points. Religion fulfills our need to fill in the unknown and politics ignites a desire in us to twist reality in order to gain power. How can we mitigate and explore these sometimes ill-intentioned desires?</p> <strong>Part 2</strong> contains <br/>Principles of Living with Gaps<p>        Creativity</p>
<p>        Openness</p>
<p>        Curiosity</p>
<p>        Self Awareness</p>
<p>        Being Non-Judgemental</p>
<p>        Humility</p> <strong>Part 3</strong> contains <br/>How to Live with the Gaps<p> </p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The <strong>editor </strong>I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April, 2021.</li>
<li>The<strong> cover design</strong> of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The <strong>layout design</strong> for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The <strong>copy editing</strong> for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The<strong> launch &amp; promotion efforts</strong> for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring.</li>
</ul>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</li>
<li>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</li>
<li>You will receive early access to the Author’s Note and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.</li>
<li>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.</li>
<li>You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</li>
<li>And much more!</li>

UPDATE: I am DONATING 15% of my proceeds to Girls Inc. 
Q&A
- Why am I allocating 15% of my proceeds to Girls Inc.?
I have been volunteering and mentoring k-12 girls for the past 2 years through Girls Inc. I have learned so much from every single of my girls and they inspire me everyday. I want to support the mission of Girls Inc. encouraging girls to be “Strong, Smart, and Bold.” 
- Are you only allocating 15% of the proceeds during the presale campaign?
No, I will continue allocating 15% of the proceeds to Girls Inc. even post launch date on April 2021. 
 
Everyone who buys or contributes to my book will also be contributing to girls in Girls Inc. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My name is Zahra Mesrizadeh and I am the author of The God of the Gaps: Understanding Science through the Lens of Religion and Politics. I wrote this book because I want to unfold the history of religion & politics and delve into how it conflicts with the scientific world. Since our pre-wired brains are prone to filling in the gaps to make sense of the world, there's much to discuss. The ultimate goal of my book is to educate my audience about our differences and turn them into our superpower. The God of the Gaps: Understanding Science through the Lens of Religion and Politics: The goal of my book is to explore science in the multi-dimensional reality of society through the lens of history, politics, and religion, and to help us understand the reality of the world in the post-truth era by acknowledging our cognitive barriers. My book will touch on the above subjects by uncovering how historical events, religion, and politics have influenced the interpretation of science, and how we can learn from and overcome these barriers as a society.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how widespread uncertainties are and how we can utilize that to understand our world instead of filling the gaps with temporary answers. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with science communication and escape from the homogeneous theme of our lives.FOR ALL: You will love this book if you are struggling with connecting different facets of identity, want to be surprised by common myths you might believe or are scared of conversation about science, religion, and politics in your circle.The God of the Gaps: Understanding Science through the Lens of Religion and Politics speaks to young college students and anyone who want to find joy and hope in science and its relatability to our everyday life and feel comfortable to talk about our affiliations in religion and politics in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that The God of the Gaps: Understanding Science through the Lens of religion and politics inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:

What are my own cognitive biases and their reflection on my thoughts?
How can we improve our circle to engage with diverse thoughts?
How can we better navigate society especially in times like a global pandemic?
I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing science, religion, and politics will change us all for the better.  The God of the Gaps: Understanding Science through the Lens of religion and politics
The book is written in [3] parts.
Part 1 contains the author’s note +         How we got here
        History of religion... how it was created to fill in gaps
        History of conflicts about religion and science
        Science of the human mind (why we tell stories to fill in gaps)
Why Now: 
With the gap between science and society growing larger by the day, it's important we face the issue head-on and examine its origin points. Religion fulfills our need to fill in the unknown and politics ignites a desire in us to twist reality in order to gain power. How can we mitigate and explore these sometimes ill-intentioned desires? Part 2 contains Principles of Living with Gaps        Creativity
        Openness
        Curiosity
        Self Awareness
        Being Non-Judgemental
        Humility Part 3 contains How to Live with the Gaps

The book will also feature an excerpt from a roundtable interview of 13 women artists who work with language and craft. Finally, we will include a list of more than 1100 women currently making visual poetry. The anthology is edited by Amanda Earl.</p><p>The following creators contribute visual poetry to <i>Judith</i>:</p><p>Firyal Al-Adhamy<br/>Rosaire Appel<br/>Erica Baum<br/>Jessica Bebenek<br/>Mez Breeze<br/>Kimberly Campanello<br/>Iris Colomb<br/>Susan Connolly<br/>Judith Copithorne<br/>Kate Daudy<br/>Paula Damm<br/>Lenora de Barros<br/>Johanna Drucker<br/>Amanda Earl<br/>CC Elian<br/>Cinzia Farina<br/>Mara Patricia Hernandez<br/>Tasneem F.

We then invited the women named by the initial 12 to contribute work to the book and name women who have inspired or influenced their own work. In this way, the book acts as a continuum, connecting present creators of visual poetry to those of the past and inspiring women now and in the future to make visual poems.</p><p>For example, asemic writer Rosaire Appel named Viviane Rombaldi Seppey as an inspiration. I hadn’t heard of Viviane before, an artist who works with maps, phonebooks, books, photographs, and collected objects as source materials used to describe the elusive meanings of places and her relation to them. She cuts, glues, folds, knits, paints, and weaves in order to intertwine physical, cultural and personal territories.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615489372/nljuhtsdidkwyovl4inq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""center""><i>Viviane Rombaldi Seppey, The World Isn't Flat</i></p><p>Viviane in turn talked about the work of Rosalie Gascoigne, a New Zealand/Australian artist whose artworks ‘hold part of words, characters from road panels, the material is cut, assembled and organized in grids pattern where visual poetry merges with the materiality of a place.’</p><p>Contributor Kimberly Campanello illustrates the vital and affirming connections made by women in her statement in the book:</p><p>‘In the summer of 2019, something remarkable happened in Leeds: Poetry by Design. There, I met two London-based poets, Iris Colomb and Sascha Akhtar. Colomb gave a paper on her work which is at-once highly performative and inherently textual. She finds incredible ways to ‘deliver’ textuality – on ping pong balls, on strips of plastic in a bathtub. If she reads from a book, it is with her body suspended from the ceiling in shibari bondage.</p><p>In the evening, Akhtar gave a powerful and genuinely witchy reading from her tarot card poems that demonstrated so clearly how the physical interaction of a reader with language can transform it, and vice versa.</p><p>Seeing these two varied approaches to visual poetics in the ‘flesh’ made a significant impact on my retrospective understanding of my work’s aims and context. I think it is vital that poets encounter diverse practices and have conversations about such differences, which exactly is what the Leeds symposium engendered and what this essential book will do. The fact that in my view the most exciting (visual) poets working today are largely women points to the end (I hope) of any need for special pleading. We are running the show.’</p><p>Statements such as these, the visual poetry and the inclusion of influences, discoveries and inspirations will help to make the book serve as a field guide to visual poetry for current and future women.</p><h3>Getting to know the editor</h3><p>I’m Amanda Earl, a Canadian writer, editor, publisher and visual poet. I’m working with Joakim Norling of Timglaset Editions to publish <i>Judith: Women Making Visual Poetry</i>. I’ve been the managing editor of Bywords.ca, a literary site and magazine since 2003, and the fallen angel of AngelHousePress since 2007, publishing chapbooks and two online magazines. In this capacity, I’ve published writing and visual poetry by creators from all over the world. I made a map of women and gender nonconforming visual poets and I have crowdsourced lists of visual poetry publishers, editors and curators. My practice for several years has been to try to support the work of women, 2SLGBTQ, BIPOC and D/deaf and disabled writers and artists by learning as much as I can about their work and amplifying their voices. Community-building is essential to me. It is a never-ending labour of love.</p><p>I’ve been making visual poetry since the mid aughts. My life’s work is to translate every verse, chapter and book of the Bible into visual poetry. My visual poetry has been published in 15 chapbooks, several anthologies and numerous sites. In 2018, Timglaset Editions published, <i>The Vispo Bible: Revelation</i>, a full-colour 28-page work.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615491238/pin1nlapnfafcmn9sncr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""center""><i>Amanda Earl, The Vispo Bible: Revelation</i></p><h3>Addressing gender imbalance</h3><p>I’ve been told more than once by male publishers that few women make visual poetry, yet I see a lot of women visual poets on social media, sharing their work, and in the art world, there are many women artists working with language elements. There is clearly a gap between formal publication and sharing informally on social media, as well as a gap between anthologized visual poetry and the work that is exhibited on gallery walls.</p><p>The low representation of women in canonical 20th century concrete and visual poetry anthologies is well-known, but what is perhaps less known is that anthologies that have published visual poetry in this century also suffer from gender imbalance.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615643871/klnzskpoq7xxjwufacnr.png"" src=""""/></p><p>There is a domino effect when women are erased from canons. Scholars who have access to research only about men will write articles and books on their work alone. This helps create the impression that the only important and interesting work is done by men.</p><h3>Connecting the past, present and future</h3><p>The book is named after Judith Copithorne, a Canadian visual poet who has been active since the 1960s and deserves greater recognition and acknowledgement. My own work has been influenced and inspired by Judith’s visual poetry.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615489577/n1gicnzlnqswyib0uyiu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""center""><i>Judith Copithorne, 9.11.6--surd-14</i></p><p>In early 2019, I asked Joakim Norling of Timglaset Editions whether he would be interested in publishing an anthology of women making visual poetry, a dream of mine for several years. Timglaset Editions has earned a reputation for its exquisite design and its focus on visual poetry, including work by women. I knew it was a good choice for the book.</p><p>We made a list of all the women making visual poetry that we knew of through our own publication of them and that of others. The initial list amounted to about 100 women. From that list, we chose 12 that represented different styles of work from asemic writing to collage to digital vispo and typewriter poems. We also tried to select from as wide range of geographical and ethnicities as we could.</p><p>One of the things I wanted to do was to prove that there were in fact, a lot of women making visual poetry. My inspiration was Mirella Bentivoglio, an Italian concrete poet, artist and performer, who when confronted with the lack of female representation promoted and exhibited the works of women in 27 exhibits throughout the world, and created a network of women artists and visual poets, ensuring that women’s work would be taken seriously in the Italian art world and beyond.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615489603/mb6eyc1iinqjhda6n5sl.png"" src=""""/></p><p align=""center""><i>Amanda Earl, Io: Homage to Mirella Bentivoglio, 2021.</i></p><p>We contacted editors, publishers, curators, and fellow visual poets who gave us additional names. This has truly been the work of a community over two years. We looked at a lot of work online and in anthologies. It became clear that in addition to what was typically considered to be visual poetry, there was also art that used language and elements of text as primary material. Not being part of the art world, I hadn’t heard of most of the artists that were named by our sources. In addition, Karl Kempton, an American visual poet and editor, was expanding my idea of visual poetry with the names he suggested but also with his book, <i>A History of Visual Text Art</i>, which contains over 500 pages and goes from ancient cave paintings to modern work, including Arabic calligraphy. It was frustrating to see work that hasn’t been anthologized in Western visual poetry books. We thought it was important to include it. We ended up with a list of over 1100 women making visual poetry.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615489689/f9tocoagvbeljjmzajbz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""center""><i>Firyal al-Adhami</i></p><h3>On schedule</h3><p>Our plan is to finish design and layout of the book by the end of April, to send out advance copies to writers for back of the book descriptions or ‘blurbs’ and to have the book printed by the end of May. We have engaged the help of a proofreader who is going through the work and ensuring consistency. We will then give the proofs to our contributors and make any changes.</p><p>The book will be 252 pages, full colour print, 190 x 230 mm, softcover with 100 mm flaps, sewn. We plan to publish a first edition of 300 copies. For this fundraising campaign we need 4500 Euros to make the project come through.</p><h3>A passion project</h3><p>I believe in solidarity and I believe there is strength in numbers.</p><p>I wanted this book to include as many women currently making visual poetry as possible to show all women that their work has value and to show them they are not alone.</p><p>I believe this book is more needed than ever. I don’t believe the book will stop the erasure of women in a patriarchal world, but I do believe it will help to support and promote women making visual poetry and to create spaces in which they can thrive.</p><h3>Glowing Reviews</h3><p>‘<i>Judith: Women Making Visual Poetry</i> is a stunningly edited anthology by Amanda Earl: if you have no idea of what visual poetry is at the outset you will by the time you close this book, with its dynamic selection of twenty three poets' works, each of which speaks to an exuberance and delight in language, as a tactile and material practice. I loved every page of it, rippling with energy and a sense of a contemporary moment and movement. This is a book that will touch your heart and make you wonder where it has been all along.’ <br/><strong>Bronac Ferran</strong></p><p>‘<i>Judith: Women Making Visual Poetry</i> finally gathers female visual poets from all corners of the world in a beautiful anthology dedicated to highlighting the excellence and abundance of visual poetry made by women. <i>Judith: Women Making Visual Poetry</i> is the anthology I wish I had growing up.’<br/><strong>Silje Ree</strong>, Creative Director, Mellom Press</p><p>'JUDITH is an incredibly important – and long overdue - addition to our understanding of Concrete Poetry. Essays, reflections, and statements join samples of exceptional work of concrete poetry by women from around the world. This volume is indispensable. Every page exposes a new vocabulary, a new perspective, and a new history. You gotta have this book. You gotta learn.'<br/><strong>Derek Beaulieu</strong></p><p>‘Judith is a fantastic and welcome insight into visual poetry from women around the globe. Its varied pages are a delight to behold, and the work revels in the materiality of language. Dynamic visuals are interspersed with critical essays, thoughtful reflections, and insightful statements.

The book will also feature an excerpt from a roundtable interview of 13 women artists who work with language and craft. Finally, we will include a list of more than 1100 women currently making visual poetry. The anthology is edited by Amanda Earl.The following creators contribute visual poetry to Judith:Firyal Al-AdhamyRosaire AppelErica BaumJessica BebenekMez BreezeKimberly CampanelloIris ColombSusan ConnollyJudith CopithorneKate DaudyPaula DammLenora de BarrosJohanna DruckerAmanda EarlCC ElianCinzia FarinaMara Patricia HernandezTasneem F.

We then invited the women named by the initial 12 to contribute work to the book and name women who have inspired or influenced their own work. In this way, the book acts as a continuum, connecting present creators of visual poetry to those of the past and inspiring women now and in the future to make visual poems.For example, asemic writer Rosaire Appel named Viviane Rombaldi Seppey as an inspiration. I hadn’t heard of Viviane before, an artist who works with maps, phonebooks, books, photographs, and collected objects as source materials used to describe the elusive meanings of places and her relation to them. She cuts, glues, folds, knits, paints, and weaves in order to intertwine physical, cultural and personal territories.Viviane Rombaldi Seppey, The World Isn't FlatViviane in turn talked about the work of Rosalie Gascoigne, a New Zealand/Australian artist whose artworks ‘hold part of words, characters from road panels, the material is cut, assembled and organized in grids pattern where visual poetry merges with the materiality of a place.’Contributor Kimberly Campanello illustrates the vital and affirming connections made by women in her statement in the book:‘In the summer of 2019, something remarkable happened in Leeds: Poetry by Design. There, I met two London-based poets, Iris Colomb and Sascha Akhtar. Colomb gave a paper on her work which is at-once highly performative and inherently textual. She finds incredible ways to ‘deliver’ textuality – on ping pong balls, on strips of plastic in a bathtub. If she reads from a book, it is with her body suspended from the ceiling in shibari bondage.In the evening, Akhtar gave a powerful and genuinely witchy reading from her tarot card poems that demonstrated so clearly how the physical interaction of a reader with language can transform it, and vice versa.Seeing these two varied approaches to visual poetics in the ‘flesh’ made a significant impact on my retrospective understanding of my work’s aims and context. I think it is vital that poets encounter diverse practices and have conversations about such differences, which exactly is what the Leeds symposium engendered and what this essential book will do. The fact that in my view the most exciting (visual) poets working today are largely women points to the end (I hope) of any need for special pleading. We are running the show.’Statements such as these, the visual poetry and the inclusion of influences, discoveries and inspirations will help to make the book serve as a field guide to visual poetry for current and future women.Getting to know the editorI’m Amanda Earl, a Canadian writer, editor, publisher and visual poet. I’m working with Joakim Norling of Timglaset Editions to publish Judith: Women Making Visual Poetry. I’ve been the managing editor of Bywords.ca, a literary site and magazine since 2003, and the fallen angel of AngelHousePress since 2007, publishing chapbooks and two online magazines. In this capacity, I’ve published writing and visual poetry by creators from all over the world. I made a map of women and gender nonconforming visual poets and I have crowdsourced lists of visual poetry publishers, editors and curators. My practice for several years has been to try to support the work of women, 2SLGBTQ, BIPOC and D/deaf and disabled writers and artists by learning as much as I can about their work and amplifying their voices. Community-building is essential to me. It is a never-ending labour of love.I’ve been making visual poetry since the mid aughts. My life’s work is to translate every verse, chapter and book of the Bible into visual poetry. My visual poetry has been published in 15 chapbooks, several anthologies and numerous sites. In 2018, Timglaset Editions published, The Vispo Bible: Revelation, a full-colour 28-page work.Amanda Earl, The Vispo Bible: RevelationAddressing gender imbalanceI’ve been told more than once by male publishers that few women make visual poetry, yet I see a lot of women visual poets on social media, sharing their work, and in the art world, there are many women artists working with language elements. There is clearly a gap between formal publication and sharing informally on social media, as well as a gap between anthologized visual poetry and the work that is exhibited on gallery walls.The low representation of women in canonical 20th century concrete and visual poetry anthologies is well-known, but what is perhaps less known is that anthologies that have published visual poetry in this century also suffer from gender imbalance.There is a domino effect when women are erased from canons. Scholars who have access to research only about men will write articles and books on their work alone. This helps create the impression that the only important and interesting work is done by men.Connecting the past, present and futureThe book is named after Judith Copithorne, a Canadian visual poet who has been active since the 1960s and deserves greater recognition and acknowledgement. My own work has been influenced and inspired by Judith’s visual poetry.Judith Copithorne, 9.11.6--surd-14In early 2019, I asked Joakim Norling of Timglaset Editions whether he would be interested in publishing an anthology of women making visual poetry, a dream of mine for several years. Timglaset Editions has earned a reputation for its exquisite design and its focus on visual poetry, including work by women. I knew it was a good choice for the book.We made a list of all the women making visual poetry that we knew of through our own publication of them and that of others. The initial list amounted to about 100 women. From that list, we chose 12 that represented different styles of work from asemic writing to collage to digital vispo and typewriter poems. We also tried to select from as wide range of geographical and ethnicities as we could.One of the things I wanted to do was to prove that there were in fact, a lot of women making visual poetry. My inspiration was Mirella Bentivoglio, an Italian concrete poet, artist and performer, who when confronted with the lack of female representation promoted and exhibited the works of women in 27 exhibits throughout the world, and created a network of women artists and visual poets, ensuring that women’s work would be taken seriously in the Italian art world and beyond.Amanda Earl, Io: Homage to Mirella Bentivoglio, 2021.We contacted editors, publishers, curators, and fellow visual poets who gave us additional names. This has truly been the work of a community over two years. We looked at a lot of work online and in anthologies. It became clear that in addition to what was typically considered to be visual poetry, there was also art that used language and elements of text as primary material. Not being part of the art world, I hadn’t heard of most of the artists that were named by our sources. In addition, Karl Kempton, an American visual poet and editor, was expanding my idea of visual poetry with the names he suggested but also with his book, A History of Visual Text Art, which contains over 500 pages and goes from ancient cave paintings to modern work, including Arabic calligraphy. It was frustrating to see work that hasn’t been anthologized in Western visual poetry books. We thought it was important to include it. We ended up with a list of over 1100 women making visual poetry.Firyal al-AdhamiOn scheduleOur plan is to finish design and layout of the book by the end of April, to send out advance copies to writers for back of the book descriptions or ‘blurbs’ and to have the book printed by the end of May. We have engaged the help of a proofreader who is going through the work and ensuring consistency. We will then give the proofs to our contributors and make any changes.The book will be 252 pages, full colour print, 190 x 230 mm, softcover with 100 mm flaps, sewn. We plan to publish a first edition of 300 copies. For this fundraising campaign we need 4500 Euros to make the project come through.A passion projectI believe in solidarity and I believe there is strength in numbers.I wanted this book to include as many women currently making visual poetry as possible to show all women that their work has value and to show them they are not alone.I believe this book is more needed than ever. I don’t believe the book will stop the erasure of women in a patriarchal world, but I do believe it will help to support and promote women making visual poetry and to create spaces in which they can thrive.Glowing Reviews‘Judith: Women Making Visual Poetry is a stunningly edited anthology by Amanda Earl: if you have no idea of what visual poetry is at the outset you will by the time you close this book, with its dynamic selection of twenty three poets' works, each of which speaks to an exuberance and delight in language, as a tactile and material practice. I loved every page of it, rippling with energy and a sense of a contemporary moment and movement. This is a book that will touch your heart and make you wonder where it has been all along.’ Bronac Ferran‘Judith: Women Making Visual Poetry finally gathers female visual poets from all corners of the world in a beautiful anthology dedicated to highlighting the excellence and abundance of visual poetry made by women. Judith: Women Making Visual Poetry is the anthology I wish I had growing up.’Silje Ree, Creative Director, Mellom Press'JUDITH is an incredibly important – and long overdue - addition to our understanding of Concrete Poetry. Essays, reflections, and statements join samples of exceptional work of concrete poetry by women from around the world. This volume is indispensable. Every page exposes a new vocabulary, a new perspective, and a new history. You gotta have this book. You gotta learn.'Derek Beaulieu‘Judith is a fantastic and welcome insight into visual poetry from women around the globe. Its varied pages are a delight to behold, and the work revels in the materiality of language. Dynamic visuals are interspersed with critical essays, thoughtful reflections, and insightful statements. With each re-reading you will find something new.’ Rachel Smith'From bold, chunky Letrasets, to delicate 3D poems literally hanging by a thread, everything is represented in this gorgeous full-colour anthology. JUDITH is a truly stunning and exciting celebration of the full breadth and depth of visual poetry created by women.' Clara Daneri, Penteract Press'Judith is a woman and a book. As a woman, Judith appears when she might have been invisible or ignored, and with her, she brings many women, as text-images, image-texts, weaving in and across and through time, the warp and the weft of language configurations that occur under various names. As a book, Judith may be read as a text and as an image, or as a text-image, appearing as a history and a possibility, however partial.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The latest entry in the Zagaboo children's book series, <i>Zagaboo Saves Christmas,</i> tells the story of how a bad case of the Elf Flu (Elfuenza, if you want to be scientific) threatens to ruin the best day of the year. With the help of a little troll magic, Zagaboo (king of the trolls) works with Santa to keep everything on schedule.  It’s a fun and heartwarming story about the true meaning of Christmas and helping others.</p>
<p>Tug your ear and say the magic words, “Zagaboo, Zagaboo where are you,” to enter Zagaboo’s Kingdom. This is a place where children encounter funny, friendly trolls who teach them to become better people by acting more like trolls. The Zagaboo stories, intended for children ages 3 to 9, revolves around the trolls and their many teaching adventures.</p>
<p>While I am beyond excited to introduce my newest book, I encourage you to read whichever book first catches your eye.  All the stories will make sense even if you haven’t read them in order. The first book, <i>The Legend of Zagaboo</i>, tells of the trolls’ origins.  In the second book, <i>Maddie Swims Troll-Style</i>, a little girl learns how to swim; in the third book, <i>Charlie Digs Dinosaurs</i>, a little boy explores his passion for paleontology despite worrying that he will accidentally break some fossils.</p>
<p>I studied cultural anthropology at George Mason and Longwood Universities. I live in the U.S.A. in the Washington DC area, where I write analytical papers for a contracting firm.  I am married to an amazing 2nd grade school teacher and am the proud father of two: one adult daughter in graduate school and one 12-year-old tennis star in-the-making.</p>
<p>As an anthropologist and a father, I understand the importance of teaching the values of love, friendship, empathy, and generosity at a young age.  Children who learn these values young are more likely to carry them forward into adulthood.  The trolls in my Zagaboo Stories embody these values and are eager to share them with your children.</p>
<p><i>Zagaboo Saves Christmas</i> is story with non-stop tinseled thrills and a great moral.  I'd love for your children to have a copy.  But I'll need your help. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to pre-sell copies of <i>Zagaboo Saves Christmas</i> in order to cover the costs of publishing, marketing, and distribution. My goal is to raise $3,000.  If I exceed that amount, I will set aside the remainder to fast-track the next entries in the <i>Zagaboo</i> series, sending out updates to all contributors whenever a new book goes live.</p>
<p>In addition to first-run copies of <i>Zagaboo Saves Christmas</i>, I am offering some exclusive rewards, including book-related merchandise (such as plush dolls and other items) and autographed copies of all books you purchase.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Zagaboo Saves Christmas and my other Zagaboo Stories are not only great fun, they also share important messages of love, friendship, empathy, and generosity.  I want as many children as possible to read them!  I am truly humbled by the amazing responses I've gotten so far to my books.  Every year, schools, libraries, and daycares invite me to read my Zagaboo Stories.  After every show, children chant the magic words, ""Zagaboo, Zagaboo, where are you?"" and recite their favorite parts of the book.  Parents who purchase the books tell me how their children insist on reading a Zagaboo Story before bedtime.  I love it!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've already published three books prior to <i>Zagaboo Saves Christmas</i>, so I don't foresee much difficulty in publishing this book in terms of the technical aspects.  The biggest challenge will be completing the coloring of the book in time to have copies printed, autographed, and at your door before Christmas day this year.  My illustrator and I have a plan to achieve this goal, but there is a small chance your books could arrive after Christmas if we miss our deadline.</p>
<p>A secondary challenge will be manufacturing the Zagaboo Christmas Dolls in time for them to be delivered (to those who order them) before Christmas.  My manufacturer assures me the dolls will be finished by late November, which should provide sufficient time for me to ship them to your homes before Christmas.  If, however, manufacturing is delayed, there is a slight chance you could receive your dolls after Christmas.</p>

RAVES for Introducing Sophia Firecracker!!!
...(I) read the intro on your website and thought it was written brilliantly - the sprouts girl made me laugh!best wishes for both you and your book,                                                                            -Cheryl -from email 
A. A. Sophia firecracker is the book of the week in our house! All of a sudden it was plucked from the book case and that was it! So funny!                                                   -from facebook
I really love your book.  My favourite part is when Sophia tries to use her superpowers and they don’t work.                                                                                -Emma Age 9
I recently had the opportunity to have A. A. Riley a new children’s author at our library. She read for us and the children were in total awe. The parents were also in attendance and were just as caught up in her story telling, so much so they all purchased the books and had Angie autograph the books.I have asked her to come back this fall and go to the schools and she has agreed, Angie loved the interaction with an audience and they loved her.-                                              - Stephanie Boltz, Director Midway Public Library
Dear A. A.,We have been having so much fun with your book... which we’ve been reading each night at bedtime!  Z loves it and has his favourites parts that he asks me to read over and over again (esp. pp. 12-13 when he continues to laugh out loud at the mention of John Paul being a “malbec!)... he’s also reading them (his fave sections) aloud, over and over again, now too! The other day I overheard Z announcing to his friend, as they climbed on the play structure in our backyard, that he has a funny book where a girl named Sophia calls a boy a “malbec” and then his teacher asks why he’s “calling John Paul a grape!!”. JThank you for the fun story times!                                                -T from email

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Painted Blocks Vitek returns home from four years abroad in Germany hoping to find the sense of community he felt so lacking there. Upon returning home he must grapple with the inevitability of change and how the home he left behind has been changing without him.<br/><br/>My name is Jakub Kocztorz and I am the author of Painted Blocks. I wrote this book because I grew tired of repetitive stories of extraordinary people marked out at birth and wanted to write about how incredible the ordinary really was.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the everyday in a setting your not familiar with. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with life as it really is and the struggles that accompany it. To see how everyday actions not merely the ones that change the world make all the difference.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are looking for a change of pace. If you want to get to know characters like you would a friend. If you’re tired of tropes and arcs and just want to feel life through someone else’s eyes.<br/><br/>Painted speaks to the Restless and Disenchanted who want to grapple with change and meaning in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Painted Blocks inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>What happens after you go on your great adventure but still haven’t found what you’re looking for?</p>
<p>What is the nature of home and our connection to it?</p>
<p>Does the ‘change the world’ narrative so prevalent today set reasonable or useful expectations for living a happy and meaningful life?</p>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing home, change, disappointment, and perspective will change us all for the better.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My name is Joyce Giboom Park and I am the author of Yellow Fantasy: Deconstructing the Legacy of Asian Fetishization. I wrote this book because of how overlooked the topic of Asian fetishization—and sexual racism—is in society, and how its history and implications are often unknown to many Asian individuals.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will come to understand how the modern phenomenon of “Yellow Fever” is rooted in insidious aspects of history and how individuals are consciously and unconsciously perpetuating its characteristics within modern relationships. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of awareness within you in becoming more conscious of sexual racism in your own life, and the need to persist against its prevalence that has already bled into multiple aspects of society. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become an activist of your own, using it as a way to start conversations regarding the topic and to educate those around you that who might be unconsciously perpetuating sexual racism.</p>
<h3>
<br/>In this book, you'll learn about:</h3>
<p>How and why Asian women came to be perceived as hyper-sexual, mysterious or submissive and docile beings.</p>
<p>How Asian fetishization and the derogatory “Yellow Fever” plays into larger themes of pornography, trafficking, and dating platforms.</p>
<p>How Asian fetishization relates to the oppression of women’s rights and BIPOC communities.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are passionate about learning more about BIPOC rights, Womxn’s rights, and about empowering Asian-American and Asian communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The book is written in [3] Parts...</h3>
<p><br/>Part [1] contains the introduction and Chapters 1-3. These chapters go over how history came to portray Asian women in a sexually-illuminating light, as well as how that came with the simultaneous rejection and emasculation of Asian men. They explore the past of how “Yellow Fever” and its modern implications came to be.<br/><br/>Part [2] contains Chapters 4-6. These chapters explore the modern implications of Asian fetishization in media &amp; pornography, sex tourism and trafficking, mail-order brides, as well as its prevalence in Alt. Right and Incel communities.<br/><br/>Part [3] contains Chapters 7-8 and the Conclusion of the book. It refers to the future of “Yellow Fever,” and the positive changes that are occurring and that can potentially occur. It refers to the changes that we, as readers of the book and as individuals in this society, can do in order to fight against sexual racism ourselves.</p>

young and should not be going out on my own, especially on a Big Adventure. Well,
guess what? I am not on my own, I have my CREATURMAL FRIENDS! 
Would you like to meet some
of my CREATURMAL FRIENDS?  Great! I am
happy you said YES!!! Here is our first Book 1: Leons BIG Adventure, where you
can learn more about me and just some of 
my Creaturmals friends!


Can you guess which
Creaturmal is Grumpy, which one is Beautiful, which one is Very Smart, and
which one is Wise?  To find out if your
answers are correct, you will need to come along on our Big Adventures and join
Leon and his friends with the Creaturmals Big Adventure Motto: “Friends,
Together  For Ever!” 
Leon and his Creaturmal
Friends love having fun, being happy, learning something new each day, and all
the things each Big Adventure story has to offer.

But to do this, Leon needs
your help along the way…
And the Creaturmals Adventure
Series will make a donation from every book sold to the good people at the
“Make-a-Wish Foundation” who really are up to some good things making less
fortunate people happier all over the world too! 
The
Creaturmals will reward all your kind support, with lots of fun, laughter, and
warm fuzzy feelings, as you join us to learn and grow, from the places we visit
and from each other. 
The more friends that believe
in us, means we can continue our Big Adventures and maybe eventually one day,
we will be able to move around walking and talking, all because of YOU!!!!! 
Could you please donate some
of your money to our “Creaturmal
Adventure Series?” Please? do not think I am rude, I am a very polite
little possum. My Nanunci taught me to ask, she would say: “If you do not ask
Leon, then how will you ever know the answer?”
Join
us and be a part of the Creaturmals “Friends, Together For Ever” Big Adventure
Crew. Donations would help the development and completion of Book 2: Willfee:
The Magic Talking Carpet and Book 3: London! Up, Up and Away!  
And your
donation would be Spucktacular; all donations will receive a Big Adventure
CHEER!!!!
I must go now, it is almost
snug time and my Grandma Nanunci always reads me new stories before Snug time.
I just love my Grandma Nanunci and her stories. 
Byeeeee!!! See you on the next adventure!!!!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Testamento de un impostor</strong> es la historia de un viejo y descreído jesuita que, tras hacer sus particulares <i>Américas</i>, regresa al terruño de donde partió con el propósito de dar ejemplo al prójimo con su sacrificio y disciplina... ideal, en su caso, más encaminado a una búsqueda/huida de sí mismo que a paliar los males espirituales del prójimo.</p>

Qué ocurre cuando llega el momento de sincerarte, ante la muerte o acaso sólo ante la posibilidad de ésta, y tras toda una vida al servicio de los demás, representando el papel que te había sido encomendado por una institución de la que reniegas y en nombre de un Dios en el que no crees, y te tienes que enfrentar a aquellos que ven en ti un modelo a seguir, un ejemplo de lo que ellos les hubiera gustado ser y no se atrevieron, un héroe de su pequeño mundo que al contrario que ellos quiso y pudo traspasar las pequeñas fronteras de éste para conocer otros y darle sentido a una vida más allá de la simple subsistencia. Qué ocurre cuando acuden a ti para que los asesores en sus pequeños proyectos personales confiando en la autoridad que te infiere toda una vida supuestamente dedicada al prójimo y al estudio.

Una novela donde se habla, no sólo de los interiores de su protagonista, sino también de su juventud durante la larga noche del franquismo cuando era seminarista, de la Venezuela de antes y después del chavismo y los trágicos episodios en los que se vio inmerso, de esa España, y más concreto del País Vasco, al que regresa ya de viejo, y sobre todo de ese otro mundo pequeño, íntimo, tan entrañable como también terrible, de la familia y los amigos a modo de último refugio después de la tempestad.</p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<i>Shufto - My Unique Journey From Sudan, Egypt, To The USA</i> is a series of stories about my personal journey as a refugee, and about the experiences of many other refugees and immigrants around the world.<br/><br/>My name is Jenaro “Shufto” Olwak Aken and I am the author of <i>Shufto - My Unique Journey From Sudan, Egypt, To The USA</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to shine a light on my experience as a refugee from Sudan, and on the refugee experiences of many others around the world. We may not have all gone through the same challenges, but we all have gone through difficult circumstances nonetheless. This is just one version of that refugee experience, and it is one you haven’t heard before now.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the world is smaller than most people think. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for life and the human experience. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand the refugee experience.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about life in Sudan, Egypt, the US, and perseverance. You'll hear stories such as...<ul>
<li>My family and my upbringing in Khartoum, Sudan.</li>
<li>The difficult decision families make to seek refugee in foreign lands and the challenges they face.</li>
<li>The importance of education, opportunity, and community.</li>
</ul> You will love this book if you like to learn about different cultures, travel, and believe in possibilities.<br/><br/><i>Shufto - My Unique Journey From Sudan, Egypt, To The USA</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to parents and students who want to look at immigration and refugees in a new way.<br/> <p><strong>The Book - Shufto - My Unique Journey From Sudan, Egypt, To The USA</strong></p>
<br/>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-5. The first five chapters focus on my family and my childhood in Sudan. I write about my family dynamics and about my struggle dealing with the name “Shufto.” I was a curious child and often got into trouble for being so curious, but my love for education helped me through that difficult time and early stages in my life.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 6-12. These chapters deal with the early stages of my education, my relationship with my parents, and my family's decision to leave Sudan for Egypt, and life in Cairo. Living in Egypt was a difficult experience for all of us, but particularly for my mother especially after a serious accident. At only ten years old, I tried my very best to support her and the family.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 </strong>contains chapters 13-19. This last part of the book covers our transition from Africa to America. The culture shock, a new language, snow, and the four seasons of Western, New York. I write about the ups and downs of growing up in Buffalo, NY and about the community as well as about the opportunity my family and I were granted to start a new life and make the best of our second chance as a refugee family in the USA.<br/><br/> <p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<p> </p>

<li>The <strong>editor</strong> I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April, 2021.</li>
<li>The <strong>cover design</strong> of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The <strong>layout design</strong> for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The <strong>copy editing</strong> for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The<strong> launch &amp; promotion efforts</strong> for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring 2021.</li>
</ul>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<p> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Amnoni Myers and I am the author of You Are the Prize! This memoir will take you on a personal journey into my life as a child who struggled to understand my identity and experiences as an adult. My parents abandoned me at birth, and I struggled to understand my worth and value in this world. With the odds stacked against me, I went through life navigating the uniqueness of who I am. At the age of twelve, with tears in my eyes, I walked into my foster mother’s bedroom and asked, “Why did God create me?!”. At the time, I was unable to see the beauty in my experiences. Despite negative statistics, I was always determined to create a different story than the one that was written about me.<br/><br/>You Are the Prize explores the complexities, the struggles, and the journey of bringing together the different identities of who I am in a world full of intricacies. As a young person who experienced early childhood trauma coupled with separation and loss from my biological family, I’ve been on a journey to understand who I am in spite of the challenges I’ve faced along the way. You Are the Prize is a personal motto and a reminder that we all deserve to know and understand what our worth regardless of what we’ve faced or experienced. I am writing this book because as a Black, queer, young person who grew up in the foster care system, I want everyone (especially young people of color) to know that their lives are valuable, and their experiences have meaning.<br/><br/>Mark Twain once said, “There are two important days in a person’s life: the day you were born and the day you find out why.” This statement is powerful beyond words but unfortunately many young people who grow up in foster care don’t always get to relish in that experience which makes the concept foreign for so many to achieve. In 2014, I stood in front of members of Congress and the White House Domestic Policy Council to present them with policy recommendations and it was then that I finally began to see the importance of my experiences. The report was inspired by my own experiences of growing up in foster care. Shortly after, I was personally invited by the Obama Administration to apply to be an intern. Never in my life did I imagine having an experience like that!<br/><br/>As I reflected on my life, I thought about the fact that the very experiences I faced are the same experiences that helped me get where I am today. Furthermore, I could not have done it alone. Without the support of a high school teacher, principal, and a host of others I’ve met on this journey, I would still be asking myself, “Why did God create me?”. My goal is that this book will help other young people understand the purpose of their individual journeys, starting with the belief that they are the prize.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of how our experiences shape our identity by confronting adversity through opportunity and the power of connection in the midst of grief and loss through narratives like:</p>
<p><strong>Black Girl in the Mirror: </strong>A story around the multiple complexities I faced as a young, black girl and the journey of understanding my inner beauty.</p>
<p><strong>The Pact: </strong>A journey into the world of siblinghood, connection, rivalry and how love formed an unbreakable bond through unexpected loss.</p>
<p><strong>Writings on the Wall:</strong> The story of how getting caught drawing graffiti on the walls led to unforeseen opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting inspirational people like Deesha Dyer,</strong> Social Secretary for the Obama Administration who inspired me to tap into my black girl magic as a White House Intern along with Introducing Former First Lady Michelle Obama on national t.v in an effort to raise awareness about young people in foster care.</p>
<p><strong>A conversation from my life with my late sister</strong> about the importance of remembering that I am the prize during a pivotal moment in my life.</p>You will love this book if you are interested in learning about the foster care system, helping young people build social capital, navigate difficult transitions and if you are looking for ways to get involved!<br/><br/>You Are the Prize speaks to young people who are currently in the system and Thought Leaders who want to grapple with transforming the child welfare system and help foster children find their voice.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that You Are the Prize inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>How have your own experiences contributed to the person you are today?</li>
<li>How can we be supportive of young people who are currently in the system or those who were formerly in the system?</li>
<li>How do we ensure that every young person in foster care knows without a doubt that they are the prize?</li>
</ol>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing the importance of providing young people with opportunities as they work through their trauma is valuable. Hopefully, having conversations like this will change us all for the better.</p>

With a focus on science and technology innovation, we take a look at major advancements over the past century, what’s happening today and what is coming, including the attributes and tools that can help us become active participants in the future.My name is April Reagan and I am the author of Bridge Makers: Becoming a Citizen Futurist. I wrote this book because I want more people to become involved in our collective future.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the empowering acts of looking for trends, thinking about what’s possible and engaging to influence the future. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for innovation. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you develop confidence in foresight and engaging stakeholders who influence our collective future.In this book, you'll learn about futurism and foresight. You'll read stories such as:
The pivots that took Cecily Sommers from from dancer to futurist.
The way MIT student Gene Becker actually stumbled into a life-long love of cutting-edge innovation.
Jane McGonigal’s realization that gaming empowers people to change the world and how it launched her on a path that set a world record for the most foresight insights generated in a day.
 You will love this book if you are interested in the future, if you want to engage in conversations about the decisions innovators are making, or want to influence potential outcomes of advancements in science and technology,Bridge Makers is a nonfiction book that speaks to life-long learners and optimists who want to look at innovation and activism in a new way. The Book - Bridge Makers: Becoming a Citizen FuturistThe book is written in 3 parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-5. In this section, the history of futurism, fly-over views of key advancements in science and technology, as well as discussions about the need for future literacy and values-based - not ideological - dialogue.Part 2 contains chapters 6-7. These two chapters are core to the book, describing the unique attributes of futurists and the foresight skills they use.Part 3 contains chapters 8-11. Here, four stakeholder groups (citizens, students and educators, policy makers and organization leaders) each have a chapter dedicated to a discussion about what the Look, Think, Act cycle looks like, and for policy makers and organizations, the importance of engaging a broader audience on major decisions. What I Need & What You'll Get This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>I am selling first editions of my book, The Dark and the Light </h3>
<p>Thanks for checking out my crowdsourcing campaign. I am Matthew John Schultz and I wrote a memoir about my childhood, life traumas, addiction, and recovery. Yet, there is so much more! There are also essays on different healing techniques, stories about my rock and roll days, my shamanic practices, and my time working as a facilitator at Ayahuasca centers in Peru and Brazil. This book is also a cautionary warning for those seeking out sacred medicine practices. It offers advice for those seeking that path. </p>
<p>Now, I need your help with presales to pay for the bulk printing and the distribution costs for online booksellers like Amazon, Apple Books, etc. I have already found a great printer and the sample copies of the hardbacks and paperbacks look wonderful! I also have a PDF version that is laid out the same as the printed books and can be used with most book readers, reader apps and on ALL computers.</p>
<p>Since I am printing these myself and sending them out directly to you... I can sign your copy if you wish. Just let me know. The printed copies should be available to mail out by mid October. </p>
<p>Thanks for your time! I appreciate your support and helping to make this project come to life. <br/>Please share this on social media and help me spread the word. This campaign ends Sept 27th, so act fast!<br/><br/>Here are some early reviews....</p>

Matthew’s work transcends that – this is something else entirely. It’s not an easy ride, but it’s worth every turn of the page. Reaching this book’s finale is well worth the time invested.”</i></p>

I feel overwhelmed with gratitude and cannot even begin to express how much your contributions mean to me. Being able to share my words with you all has been a blessing in so many ways. </p><p>Because we have reached this goal, I will now be able to publish a paperback, ebook, audiobook, and a hardcover.</p><p>Thank you a million times over. I cannot even believe that this is real!</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2><p><i>The Language of Loss</i> is a collection of stories about the overwhelming heartache of grief and the ways in which we grow through our pain. <br/><br/>My name is Natalie Sanchez and I am the author of The Language of Loss. I wrote this book because my experience with grief has transformed my life in every way. As death always does, the loss completely derailed my life. It has challenged my values, my faith, my relationships, and my happiness. But it also has inspired tremendous growth. In the time that I have lived without my dad, I have become an entirely new human being. There is something devastatingly beautiful about the way we metamorphose through pain.<br/><br/>After my dad’s death, I wanted to honor him and all the lessons he left behind. His absence propelled me into periods of deep reflection, where I began to question my purpose, life’s purpose, and what it really means to lose someone. I experienced an inexplicable compulsion to tell my story, not just for me, but for all other people struggling with loss. I couldn’t help but notice that alongside the overpowering grief, tragedy allowed me to form deeper and stronger connections with people than I ever had before. <br/><br/>I hope that in reading this book, those struggling to navigate life with loss can rediscover a sense of passion and purpose. By sharing my story, I want to help others realize they can give, they can heal, and they can grow. I hope that the stories of others will inspire you as much as they inspire me. I hope that you come to know how seamlessly grief and joy can coexist with one another. And I hope that this book can become a source of comfort, a reminder that healing without ever moving on, maybe: is... possible.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll hear stories from my life, but also from others who have experienced loss. You will hear stories of heartbreak and hope, grief and gratitude, anecdotes of ordinary people and the tragedies that shaped them. These stories include losses of all forms - parents, grandparents, children, friends, siblings - because although grief never manifests itself in the same way, it is universally transformative.<br/><br/>If you have ever lost someone you love, or even if you know someone who is grieving, you will love this book. Things like death and tragedy are inevitable, but within loss lies an endless potential for goodness. My intention is to share my experience and supplement it with the stories and insight I have learned along the way.<br/><br/><i>The Language of Loss</i> is a memoir that speaks to the power of hope and purpose in the face of profound heartache.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>The Book - The Language of Loss</strong></h2><p>The book is broken up into three parts, each characterized by the different stages of my experience and the lessons I have learned from others throughout my journey.<br/><br/>Part 1, <strong>Falling: The Journey We Didn’t Choose</strong>, contains the introduction and additional chapters. This part of the book details the shock we feel after loss, the way we must embark on a new, completely foreign chapter. Stories in this part describe the unwilling transition and the paralyzing heartache that we experience as we try to carry on. <br/><br/>Part 2, <strong>Rising: Navigation and Rediscovery</strong>, is comprised of stories that represent the exploratory stages of grief. As we move about our journeys in deviating, non-linear ways, tiny pockets of beauty unexpectedly surface through the pain. These are stories of learning to rise and embrace what is good amid the heartache.<br/><br/>Part 3, <strong>Forward: Infinite Directions</strong>, culminates with the stories of growth. Finding our footing on this journey is an endless process that inspires new relationships, perspectives, and values. With the right mindset, we have the potential to cultivate purpose and passion from our deepest pain.<br/> </p><h2><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

</ul><h3>Thank you so much for all of your love and support!<br/><br/>Thanks again,<br/>Natalie Sanchez</h3></div>","OverviewI have reached my $8,000 goal!Thank you to each and every one of you for supporting me throughout this journey. I feel overwhelmed with gratitude and cannot even begin to express how much your contributions mean to me. Being able to share my words with you all has been a blessing in so many ways. Because we have reached this goal, I will now be able to publish a paperback, ebook, audiobook, and a hardcover.Thank you a million times over. I cannot even believe that this is real! Story of My BookThe Language of Loss is a collection of stories about the overwhelming heartache of grief and the ways in which we grow through our pain. My name is Natalie Sanchez and I am the author of The Language of Loss. I wrote this book because my experience with grief has transformed my life in every way. As death always does, the loss completely derailed my life. It has challenged my values, my faith, my relationships, and my happiness. But it also has inspired tremendous growth. In the time that I have lived without my dad, I have become an entirely new human being. There is something devastatingly beautiful about the way we metamorphose through pain.After my dad’s death, I wanted to honor him and all the lessons he left behind. His absence propelled me into periods of deep reflection, where I began to question my purpose, life’s purpose, and what it really means to lose someone. I experienced an inexplicable compulsion to tell my story, not just for me, but for all other people struggling with loss. I couldn’t help but notice that alongside the overpowering grief, tragedy allowed me to form deeper and stronger connections with people than I ever had before. I hope that in reading this book, those struggling to navigate life with loss can rediscover a sense of passion and purpose. By sharing my story, I want to help others realize they can give, they can heal, and they can grow. I hope that the stories of others will inspire you as much as they inspire me. I hope that you come to know how seamlessly grief and joy can coexist with one another. And I hope that this book can become a source of comfort, a reminder that healing without ever moving on, maybe: is... possible.In this book, you'll hear stories from my life, but also from others who have experienced loss. You will hear stories of heartbreak and hope, grief and gratitude, anecdotes of ordinary people and the tragedies that shaped them. These stories include losses of all forms - parents, grandparents, children, friends, siblings - because although grief never manifests itself in the same way, it is universally transformative.If you have ever lost someone you love, or even if you know someone who is grieving, you will love this book. Things like death and tragedy are inevitable, but within loss lies an endless potential for goodness. My intention is to share my experience and supplement it with the stories and insight I have learned along the way.The Language of Loss is a memoir that speaks to the power of hope and purpose in the face of profound heartache. The Book - The Language of LossThe book is broken up into three parts, each characterized by the different stages of my experience and the lessons I have learned from others throughout my journey.Part 1, Falling: The Journey We Didn’t Choose, contains the introduction and additional chapters. This part of the book details the shock we feel after loss, the way we must embark on a new, completely foreign chapter. Stories in this part describe the unwilling transition and the paralyzing heartache that we experience as we try to carry on. Part 2, Rising: Navigation and Rediscovery, is comprised of stories that represent the exploratory stages of grief. As we move about our journeys in deviating, non-linear ways, tiny pockets of beauty unexpectedly surface through the pain. These are stories of learning to rise and embrace what is good amid the heartache.Part 3, Forward: Infinite Directions, culminates with the stories of growth. Finding our footing on this journey is an endless process that inspires new relationships, perspectives, and values. With the right mindset, we have the potential to cultivate purpose and passion from our deepest pain. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<div>On my son’s seventh birthday, I had a biopsy done on my thyroid. Seven days later, I found out I had cancer. The news blindsided me.  It acted as a cold bucket of water, and made me stop and figure out, “Now what?” In the midst of being a single mother and traveling monthly to take care of my 91 year old grandmother, I had surgery, started treatments, and began writing a book.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have always wanted to write a book based on my grandfather’s life. He was one of the first licensed morticians in the state of Maryland. Well after his death, one question I wished I could have asked him was how the news of the sinking of the Titanic impacted his community and family. <i>The Canoe</i> is my fictional answer.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It took me one year to write <i>The Canoe,</i> and has taken eight months to prepare for publication. I plan to take <i>The Canoe</i> as far as possible, and have it land in the hands of James Cameron. Think big. Be bold. Why not?</div>

<h3>Praise for <i>The Canoe</i>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>""Michelle Baker has created a memorable gem of a
story in <i>The Canoe.</i> Her sparse, evocative use of language engages the
senses and the interplay of themes of love, loss, fate and faith engages the
mind. This little book is worth reading and reading again.""</p>
<p>–<b>Anne Hillerman</b>, author, <i>Spider
Woman's Daughter</i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>“Poetic and mysterious, Michelle Baker’s first novel evokes the
simplicity of centuries past — and through that simplicity, the reader is
brought deeply into the thoughts and emotions of the characters.”</p>
<p>–<b>Katherine Mayfield</b>, author, <i>The Box of Daughter,</i> and <i>Bullied</i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>“In <i>The Canoe, </i>Michelle Baker’s
mesmerizing prose places readers in peril in exhilarating ways that
are rare in contemporary literature. In this book’s converging stories of wild
love and unimaginable loss, the author has conjured the human tribe at the
moment of wonder when we open our arms to life and at the moment of awe when we
open them to the embrace of death.”</p>
<p>–<b>Kevin McIlvoy</b>, author, <i>The
Complete History of New Mexico &amp; other stories, Hyssop, Little Peg</i>, and
<i>The Fifth Station</i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>“Pure poetry in motion. A swift-moving, heartfelt tale of love and loss,
two stories intersecting—and connecting—by magic. Michelle Baker is a born
poet, and a born writer. <i>The Canoe </i>is just the start of what I hope to be a
long idyllic journey through the love and soul of the human heart.”</p>
<p>    –<b>Trent
Zelazny</b>, author, <i>People Person</i> and <i>To Sleep Gently</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This is a dazzling, deft
collision of the human experience, history with an audible pulse, and truly
literary expression. Baker navigates <i>The Canoe’s</i> ambitious themes boldly and
leaves the reader richer for it.”</p>
<p>– <b>Candace Walsh</b>,
author, <i>Licking the Spoon: a Memoir of Food, Family, and Identity</i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>“In her book <i>The Canoe, </i>Michelle Baker mesmerizes the
reader gently into powerful contemplation. Engaging characters with compelling
plot textured integrated points of view flow naturally. Baker soulfully invites
us into authentic specificity through the organic language of character, which
unpretentiously unearths the universal.</p>
<p><i>The Canoe</i> uniquely transfixes me into a contemplative state naturally from a
thoughtful writer and her soulful characters.”</p>
<p>– <b>Doug Vincent</b>, Founder, Boulder Storyhealers; Playwright, <i>A
Day For Grace</i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>“Michelle Baker has penned a lyrical and poignant tale in the year 1912
from two different points of view– a boy named Bernie and a young widow named
Katherine…. The journey takes us back and forth from boy to woman, from land to
sea, weaving a story of love and loss, of power and weakness…offering us, in
Michelle’s words, ‘a pen transcribing our history in a distinct and invisible
line.’”</p>

director of Stage Left Studio, NYC</p>

show received fantastic reviews, and went on to return to New York for a third
time. It is exciting to come forward again with another project that has just
as much support, interest and enthusiasm behind it. I know what it takes to
launch something big and am ready to do whatever it takes to bring out The Canoe.



The book’s official
launch date is November 1, and I already have book talks scheduled in
Asheville, NC on November 1st (at Gallery Minerva) and in Annapolis, MD on
November 7th (at the Annapolis Bookstore.) Additional talks are in the works. 

I’m also delighted to
report that The Canoe will be
represented at the 66th Frankfurt Book Fair—
the most important book event in the world, expected to draw 7,500 publishers
from 110 countries eager to purchase rights, arrange co-publishing deals and
expand their distribution lists.

I’ve
done my due diligence: all pre-publication review copies have been submitted to
library publications and my media kit is in the works. The launch date of
November 1st is just around the corner, and with your support my entire team is
ready to go.




  Other Ways You Can Help
Community

Praise for The Canoe


""Michelle Baker has created a memorable gem of a
story in The Canoe. Her sparse, evocative use of language engages the
senses and the interplay of themes of love, loss, fate and faith engages the
mind. This little book is worth reading and reading again.""
–Anne Hillerman, author, Spider
Woman's Daughter

“Poetic and mysterious, Michelle Baker’s first novel evokes the
simplicity of centuries past — and through that simplicity, the reader is
brought deeply into the thoughts and emotions of the characters.”
–Katherine Mayfield, author, The Box of Daughter, and Bullied

“In The Canoe, Michelle Baker’s
mesmerizing prose places readers in peril in exhilarating ways that
are rare in contemporary literature. In this book’s converging stories of wild
love and unimaginable loss, the author has conjured the human tribe at the
moment of wonder when we open our arms to life and at the moment of awe when we
open them to the embrace of death.”
–Kevin McIlvoy, author, The
Complete History of New Mexico & other stories, Hyssop, Little Peg, and
The Fifth Station

“Pure poetry in motion. A swift-moving, heartfelt tale of love and loss,
two stories intersecting—and connecting—by magic. Michelle Baker is a born
poet, and a born writer. The Canoe is just the start of what I hope to be a
long idyllic journey through the love and soul of the human heart.”
    –Trent
Zelazny, author, People Person and To Sleep Gently
 
“This is a dazzling, deft
collision of the human experience, history with an audible pulse, and truly
literary expression. Baker navigates The Canoe’s ambitious themes boldly and
leaves the reader richer for it.”
– Candace Walsh,
author, Licking the Spoon: a Memoir of Food, Family, and Identity

“In her book The Canoe, Michelle Baker mesmerizes the
reader gently into powerful contemplation. Engaging characters with compelling
plot textured integrated points of view flow naturally. Baker soulfully invites
us into authentic specificity through the organic language of character, which
unpretentiously unearths the universal.
The Canoe uniquely transfixes me into a contemplative state naturally from a
thoughtful writer and her soulful characters.”
– Doug Vincent, Founder, Boulder Storyhealers; Playwright, A
Day For Grace

“Michelle Baker has penned a lyrical and poignant tale in the year 1912
from two different points of view– a boy named Bernie and a young widow named
Katherine…. The journey takes us back and forth from boy to woman, from land to
sea, weaving a story of love and loss, of power and weakness…offering us, in
Michelle’s words, ‘a pen transcribing our history in a distinct and invisible
line.’”

<p><strong>En México, 50% de la población es menor de 26 años</strong>. Se dice que tenemos 8 millones de jóvenes que no estudian ni trabajan de manera regular.

<p> En Ollin tenemos muchas preguntas sobre los jóvenes en México. Somos una organización de jóvenes que trabaja con otros jóvenes para buscar y mejorar los espacios de participación juvenil en nuestro país. La pregunta que queremos responder este año es ésta: <strong>¿Qué tanto los jóvenes estamos tomando en nuestras manos este país? </strong>Y para contestarla, nos surgieron otras cuantas, como por ejemplo: ¿Los jóvenes somos parte de las instituciones gubernamentales, de las educativas, de los emprendedores, de la sociedad civil organizada? La aventura comenzó cuando <strong>decidimos darles respuesta</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>El Índice Nacional de Participación Juvenil (INPJ)</strong> es una investigación científica y formal, realizada por Ollin, Jóvenes en Movimiento. El INPJ <strong>medirá el grado de participación</strong> de las personas de 15 a 29 años de edad en 5 <strong>espacios de incidencia</strong> (gobierno federal, universidades, partidos políticos, empresas y organizaciones no gubernamentales), en relación con 7 <strong>temas clave de la agenda</strong>: sustentabilidad ambiental; educación; equidad de género; derechos sexuales y reproductivos; promoción y defensa de los derechos humanos; empleo, emprendedurismo y autoempleo; y gobernabilidad y participación ciudadana.</p>
<p>¿Por qué nos parece relevante? Sencillo. <strong>Somos jóvenes y queremos participar</strong>. Nuestro sueño: hacer que otros jóvenes en México puedan potenciar sus esfuerzos para mejorar al país, en todos los sentidos.</p>
<p>¿Cómo le vamos a hacer? Les pedimos a representantes del gobierno a nivel federal, de las instituciones de educación superior, de las organizaciones de la sociedad civil, los partidos políticos y las micro, pequeñas y medianas empresas que nos compartan <strong>información sobre cuántos jóvenes están haciendo cosas en cada uno de ellos</strong>. Les preguntamos <strong>qué tipo de cosas hacen los jóvenes </strong>en los diferentes ámbitos. Con esta información, vamos a sacar <strong>conclusiones</strong> sobre <strong>qué tanto los jóvenes estamos apropiándonos de los espacios de incidencia en la agenda pública</strong>. En otras palabras, vamos a poder medir qué tanto los jóvenes estamos participando en la toma y operación de decisiones importantes en este país.</p>
<p> ¿Y luego? Teniendo esa información, vamos a hacer <strong>propuestas de líneas de acción</strong> a todos los espacios de incidencia, <strong>para potenciar la participación</strong> de los jóvenes en México.  </p>
<p> ¿Qué vamos a hacer con el Índice? Lo vamos a poner en línea para que todos lo puedan ver. ¿Quiénes son “todos”? “Todos” incluye a los jóvenes, a los adultos, a los maestros, a las instituciones de educación, a las organizaciones de la sociedad civil, a los grupos y colectivos, a los líderes de opinión, periodistas, bloggeros, a los padres de familia, a los legisladores, a los operadores y diseñadores de políticas públicas, al gobierno en su totalidad, a nuestros amigos y aliados.</p>
<p> Entonces, ¿todos lo van a poder usar? Sí. <strong>El INPJ será un instrumento de libre acceso</strong>. Mientras más lo usen, mejor. El Índice se construye a partir de información que nos pertenece a todos. <strong>Queremos que todos puedan beneficiarse de los resultados.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In Mexico, 50% of the population is under 26 years of age. </strong>There are around 30 million young people in our country. Statistics show that there are 8 million youngsters who do not have jobs or attend school regularly. People in Mexico are concerned about this. Nevertheless, simple math tells us there should therefore be at least <strong>22 million youngsters</strong> who are getting involved in important stuff in our beloved country. We want to know about these people. Where are they? What are they doing to improve Mexico? What are their areas of interest? What moves them? Are they working, studying… making decisions on behalf of our nation? <strong>What are they involved in?</strong></p>
<p>Ollin is a Mexican NGO. Founded and run by young people, we have been working throughout 2012 to answer a pretty basic question: <strong>What is the level of involvement that young people have in Mexico? </strong>It turns out that, in order to get this answer, one must first address some other questions, such as: Are young people participating in the government, within schools, are they starting businesses or working at / founding NGOs? Ollin’s quest began several months ago, when <strong>we decided we wanted to get the answers</strong> for all these queries.</p>
<p>Ergo, we created the National Youth Involvement Index Mexico (NYIIMx). This research project is designed to create ways of <strong>measuring the level of youth involvement</strong> in <strong>5 areas of incidence</strong> (the Federal Government, universities, political parties, NGOs and small enterprises), with relation to <strong>7 key agenda items</strong>: the environment, education, gender equality, the promotion and protection of human rights, employment and entrepreneurship, sexual and reproductive health and good governance.</p>
<p>Why is this relevant to us? Simple. <strong>We are young and want to participate</strong>. Our aim: to propell young people’s efforts throughout Mexico, in order to improve our nation.</p>
<p>How are we to achieve such goal? We are currently in the process of gathering information from the federal government, universities, local NGOs, parties and small businesses. <strong>We are asking them about young people within their organizations</strong> and the kind of actions they are orchestrating from these scenarios. With this information, <strong>we will build conclusions on how much youth are taking control of key spaces of incidence in Mexico</strong>.</p>
<p>OK, then what? Once we have this information, we are going to use it to <strong>create public policy proposals in order to foster youth involvement</strong>. Simple as that.</p>
<p>The NYIIMx will be available online so everyone can have access to it. By “everyone” we mean youth, grown-ups, teachers, universities, NGOs, civil society, journalists, opinion leaders, bloggers, parents, lawmakers, public policy designers and operators, the Federal and local branches of government, our friends and allies.</p>
<p>Let me get this straight. You’re saying every single person will be able to consult it? That’s right! <strong>The NYIIMx will be a public document</strong>. It will be built using public information, so it belongs to everyone. <strong>We want everyone to be able to profit from our findings</strong>.</p>
<p>For this to become true, we need your help. We already have a million motives to go all the way and have the Index made. But we want you to share your motives with us. We are valuing each of your motives in approximately 1 USD. This means we need around 100,000 motives to make our project real. We need your help to squeeze the NYIIMx from our brains and turn it into a readable document. Give us a little push forward!</p></div>","En México, 50% de la población es menor de 26 años.

The bulging middle class (aka ""aam aadmi""s) frustrated with such a situation supported the rise of a visionary leader in JFK that set the stage for a massive transformation of politics and governance in the US - dreaming big (""put a man on the moon"", ""US has to be a super power"") enabling US to become what it is today. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is redefining politics in India. AAP has shown ""aam aadmis"" that wish to change the governance & politics can indeed transform India back to what our forefathers & freedom fighters envisioned.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a poet and the author of <em>me and Nina,</em> a 2010 Kinereth Gensler manuscript award that published in January. At 58, <em>me and Nina</em> is my debut poetry collection, a milestone I have been working towards for a very long time.  In March, I ran an Indie Go Go campaign to attend the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP) conference in Chicago. Copies of “me and Nina” sold out at the conference and I made numerous contacts.</p>
<p>I now have another amazing opportunity for <em>me and Nina</em>: a reading at the Keats Festival and performance with the award-winning flautist, Keith Waithe whose musical style is a fusion of jazz, classical, African, Caribbean, Asian and Western influences. During the festival, I will also give a short talk about poetry.</p>
<p>The festival is held at the Keats House in Hampstead, north London, where the poet John Keats (1795-1821) lived from 1818 to 1820, and is the setting that inspired some of his most memorable poetry, including <em>Ode to a Nightingale</em>.</p>
<p>The Keats Festival, held this year from May 28 - June 10,  is a free public event and although one of the organizers has offered me a place to stay, they cannot pay my airfare or provide per diem. I will be paid a small honorarium that will not cover my travel expenses and is not paid until several weeks after the event.  They will also sell ""me and Nina,"" at the festival and include my participation in press materials promoting the festival.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My campaign goal is $2700. If I reach my goal, I can expect to receive an estimated $2511. This would cover airfare and baggage fees from New York to London, food, ground transportation and incidental expenses. Any funds I am unable to raise, I will attempt to borrow. I am also seeking other reading and network opportunities while I am in London. </p>
<p>What you get:  writing services (see perks), my extreme gratitude, and the opportunity to help give voice to a collection of poems that speaks to  ""what happens to a dream deferred"" and  the resilency of the human spirit to survive in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>Go to ""Made by Hand"" facebook page to view my hand made books.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>During the Keats Festival, the opportunity exists for <em>me and Nina</em> to be heard by thousands.  With this call I also have the chance to reach out and give back to fellow writers and readers of poetry and expand the awareness of African American poetry in Great Britain. Participating at the Keats Festival could lead to additional engagements and creative collaborations.</p>
<p>Writing for ""The Library Journal,"" Karla Huston states that the collection, ""...gives readers poems in concert and communion with soul great Nina Simone--like ""two souls in a duet."" While Simone's songs are a fusion of gospel, pop, and classical music, Hand's poems are a fusion of free verse, blues, torch songs, and songs of the tortured, many with formal elements and many cases using her own original forms...These poems deal with hard times, poverty, violence, the abuse of power, and abused dreams.""   </p>
<p>In his blog, Alan King quotes the poet Elizabeth Alexander, “These poems are unsentimental, blood red, and positively true, note for note, like the singing of Nina Simone herself.”  He writes poets Terrance Hayes and Tyehimba Jess also agree. “She [Monica Hand] shifts dynamically through voices and forms homemade, received and re-imagined to conjure the music (and Muses) of art and experience,” writes Hayes.</p>
<p>After reading me and Nina, I felt that Jess best summed up this collection. “Monica A. Hand sings us a crushed velvet requiem of Nina Simone.” Whoa! That’s the best way to put it. “She plumbs Nina’s mysterious blues line while recounting the scars of her own overcoming,” Jess continued. “Hand joins the chorus of shouters like Patricia Smith and Wanda Coleman in this searchlight of a book, bearing her voice like a torch for all we’ve gained and lost in the heat of good song.”</p>

<p>My name is Angela García-Sermeño, and I am traveling to Greece in July with the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=529306997110575&amp;set=vb.100000938378643&amp;type=3&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Concert Choir performing Misa Azteca, May 2013"">Southwestern College Concert Choir</a> to perform at the <a href=""http://www.festivaloftheaegean.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Festival of the Aegean"">Festival of the Aegean</a>. I have been singing with the SWC Concert Choir since fall 2011, coincidentally the same semester that I began to pursue creative writing as more than a hobby.</p>
<p>When the opportunity to travel with the choir arose, immediately I knew I’d be documenting the trip with as much writing and photography as possible. However, when considering the means in which this documentation would be shared, I was struck with the reality of not owning a working camera or computer. Sure, I can return to the nostalgia of letter-writing, carry along my sketch pad, or invest in a carrier pigeon, but blogging seems much more effective for both writer and audience these days.</p>
<p>With your contributions, I’m hoping to purchase a tablet and camera before leaving for Greece so that I can run a respectable blog while there. The more contributions I receive, the richer my blog will be, as I’ll be able to spend the few dollars I’ve saved to enjoy the culture outside the hotel. (If not, I shall be confined to surviving on food stashed from the continental breakfast buffet.)</p>
<h2><strong>Everybody wins.</strong></h2>
<p>I’m requesting $500 because it’s the minimum amount required on this website, but really $500 will be just enough for a decent tablet and camera. As if the promises of my blog were not enough – hello, you’re going to be viewing gorgeous photos of Greece and reading about my adventures in another country – I’m offering perks* that are worth every penny of your donation: BAKED GOODS. For those who know me, you know what kind of treats to expect. For those who have not had the pleasure, take a gander at the “perks” collage. I craft gourmet cupcakes and other goodies, usually based on a simple recipe and embellished by my experience and good taste. ;-)</p>

My name is Angela García-Sermeño, and I am traveling to Greece in July with the Southwestern College Concert Choir to perform at the Festival of the Aegean. I have been singing with the SWC Concert Choir since fall 2011, coincidentally the same semester that I began to pursue creative writing as more than a hobby.
When the opportunity to travel with the choir arose, immediately I knew I’d be documenting the trip with as much writing and photography as possible. However, when considering the means in which this documentation would be shared, I was struck with the reality of not owning a working camera or computer. Sure, I can return to the nostalgia of letter-writing, carry along my sketch pad, or invest in a carrier pigeon, but blogging seems much more effective for both writer and audience these days.
With your contributions, I’m hoping to purchase a tablet and camera before leaving for Greece so that I can run a respectable blog while there. The more contributions I receive, the richer my blog will be, as I’ll be able to spend the few dollars I’ve saved to enjoy the culture outside the hotel. (If not, I shall be confined to surviving on food stashed from the continental breakfast buffet.)
Everybody wins.
I’m requesting $500 because it’s the minimum amount required on this website, but really $500 will be just enough for a decent tablet and camera. As if the promises of my blog were not enough – hello, you’re going to be viewing gorgeous photos of Greece and reading about my adventures in another country – I’m offering perks* that are worth every penny of your donation: BAKED GOODS. For those who know me, you know what kind of treats to expect. For those who have not had the pleasure, take a gander at the “perks” collage. I craft gourmet cupcakes and other goodies, usually based on a simple recipe and embellished by my experience and good taste. ;-)


$10 -- For a ten-dollar donation, you can choose from the following:

Half dozen brownies or blondies (plain or specialty upon request)





Half dozen 3-inch cookies (chocolate chip, peanut butter, or snickerdoodle)




$25 -- For a twenty-five dollar donation, you can choose from the following:

One dozen gourmet cupcakes

Apple spice cupcakes with cream cheese frosting and candied ginger
S’more cupcakes (chocolate or vanilla cake with marshmallow frosting, chocolate ganache, and graham cracker topping)


A gourmet confection of equal value as the gourmet cupcakes. (Be creative, and I’ll do my best to honor your requests.)




$50 -- For a fifty-dollar donation, I’ll make you a birthday or holiday cake (9x13, double-layer 8-inch round, or bundt) or two dozen gourmet cupcakes.


$100 -- For a hundred-dollar donation, I’ll create something spectacular for you. Here are some possibilities based on the cakes that I’ve made for my family, whom I credit with inspiring such delectable masterpieces.

Tres leches cake with caramel, whipped cream filling, and chocolate ganache exterior
Tiramisu cake (vanilla cake steeped in coffee liqueur and filled/frosted with mascarpone cream)
Banana cake with peanut butter filling/frosting, sliced bananas, milk chocolate glaze, and salted peanuts
Strawberry cake with macerated berry filling, cream cheese frosting, and fresh berry glaze
Chocolate stout cake with Irish cream frosting and whiskey ganache

<p>I’m a fantasy author living just outside Toronto, Canada. In 2010 and 2011, my short stories placed back to back in the Writers’ Journal annual Fiction Contest, and were published in the magazine. Encouraged by my success, I decided to forgo the crazy/frustrating/tedious process of submitting to traditional publishers, and enter the world of self-publishing. (Which is a whole other crazy process, but I don’t regret it for a minute!)</p>

It’s a combination of epic fantasy novels and short story adventures, with elves, dwarves, dragons, magic, and even the occasional vampire. They have a Lord of the Rings feel, but they’re much faster paced, and more action oriented, with lots of battles and snarky/sarcastic dialogue.</p>

This is where I’m hoping you can help me out…</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About Storm Rider</strong></h3>
<p>Storm Rider is the latest novel in the Lasniniar series. It's going to tie all the previous books together. The first draft has just been completed, and it’s currently 113,000 words. <strong>If you’re into book trailers, you can check out the one for Storm Rider <a href=""http://youtu.be/Pe3DwQlhbhc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>And here’s the book blurb for those who aren’t book trailer fans:</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The elves think the years of terror and darkness are finally over.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">They believe they have already witnessed the worst evil the world has ever known.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">When Iarion senses a growing malice in the uncharted south, his people think him a fool for seeking it out.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">They couldn’t be more wrong.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<p>Storm Rider will be released in both ebook and paperback format. If everything goes according to plan, I should be able to put it out in September.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What’s the deal with Indiegogo?</strong></h3>
<p>Indiegogo is a crowd funding site. Independent authors and other creative types offer perks in exchange for your contribution. Indiegogo offers two different campaign options: Fixed or Flexible.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to go with a Flexible campaign. This means I will receive all of the funds raised by my deadline, even if I don’t hit my goal. One of the main reasons I went this way was to enable the option to contribute directly with a credit card, instead of being limited to Paypal. I wanted to make as many different payment choices available as possible.</p>
<p>The perks will be delivered to you after the campaign is over, and when I have all of the materials ready to send out. This will likely end up being late August/early September for the electronic materials, and September/October (depending on how fast the post office is, and how far away you live) for anything physical that needs to be mailed. You will receive updates from me along the way.</p>
<p>This is my first campaign, so I’ve tried to set a modest goal. If we <em>do</em> manage to go over, the extra funds will go toward forthcoming books in the Lasniniar series.</p>
<p>Every little bit helps. Even if you can share a link to this campaign to help get the word out, I would really appreciate it! (There are some handy tools for this right under the video above.) If there is anything you would like to see added to the perk list, let me know. I’m open to suggestions. :)</p>

<p>If you were to travel the world, you would quickly come to realize that the vast majority of humanity has the same list of wants and needs: food, shelter, water, education, justice and safety, to name a few. Our joys and sorrows, hopes and desperations are also very similar in many ways.</p>
<p>Even though it sometimes justifies our personal paradigm to believe differently, <strong>WE ARE ALL FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME</strong>. If at the core we all seem to be the same, why then is it that we are collectively having such a hard time? Essentially, this last question is what inspired my desire to write this book. The purpose of the book is threefold: to bring about an awareness of the current situation on the planet so that people can start to question their current paradigm and see how they feed into the problems rather than help solve them; to encourage a new level of personal responsibility that is necessary in times of change; and provide information and tools to help in the transformational process by empowering people.</p>
<p>The content of the book comes from decades of observations and experiences gained by living and working in more than nine different countries, visiting over sixty countries spread on five continents, and having a love, a passion and ultimately, a belief that humanity has the power to choose to create a better life for all.</p>
<p>This need for a better life for all has never been as apparent as it is now. Our collective denial of the reality of suffering is being confronted. We are starting to realize that there is no choice but to deal with it: problems are not going away but rather, they seem to be multiplying exponentially. Perhaps we live in times where it has become luxurious thinking to believe that someone else will fix the environment, the economy, social injustices, international conflicts, human trafficking, or poverty.</p>
<p><strong>It is time for greatness on a mass level to be expressed</strong>. This book is meant to appeal to your heart more than your mind, thus 'Revolution of the heart'. The expression ‘analyzing something to death’ couldn’t be more appropriate than now. Will we die as a species because of our mind’s obsession for analysis or will our hearts see through the smoke, put out the fires so that at some point, hopefully sooner than later, the mind will be able to see clearly through its confusion.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the question is <strong>how will we individually and collectively deal with the problems currently facing humanity?</strong></p>
<p>There are countless ways one can contribute to the betterment of the world. It always starts with people taking one small step to make a difference. <strong>It starts with YOU!</strong> Never underestimate the power that one person has to change the world. I invite you to join me in the publication of this work. Ideally, I see the realization of this project as a collaborative effort, to be infused with the energies of many. So how can I help you ask? </p>

<li>If you can’t contribute financially, please use the indiegogo share tools to ‘like’ this project through your various social network affiliations. The more ‘likes’ the project gets, the more chances the project has to be showcased as one of indiegogo’s specially chosen projects, giving it more exposure. Every little bit adds to become a lot in the end!</li>
<li>Contribute through adding a <strong><em>positive</em></strong> and <strong><em>uplifting</em></strong> comment to the comment section. Share your belief and passion in humanity’s ability to effectively deal with the issues we are all currently facing! A kind word is often just what people need to hear!</li>
<li>Contribute financially according to your ability to do so. Alongside are options you can choose from.</li>
<li>You have a great idea that you feel the need to share, send me an email! This book is certainly not the last project aligned with doing my part on making the world a better place. Great ideas shared can sometimes become very powerful tools for change. From these great ideas, we can create global communities that can be a voice for change. Remember that everything started with an idea!</li>
<li>Ultimately, more than anything, <em><strong>YOU BE THE CHANGE</strong></em> through your kindness, compassion and understanding towards yourself and others.</li>

<ul>
<li>Editorial costs</li>
<li>Graphic design costs</li>
<li>Software costs</li>
<li>Formatting costs (for eBook version and paperback version)</li>

<li>Compensation to contributors (including shipping costs as needed)</li>

<li>Create an audio version of the book to cater to visually impaired people</li>
<li>Translation of the book in other languages</li>
<li>Creation of vignettes to help empower people further</li>

<li>And so much more!</li>
</ul><p>The bottom line is that the more money there is, the more can be done!

There are minimal risks. We will publish the magazine regardless of the support we receive. However, we hoped to gain support from the community to help alleviate the financial burden of starting out a magazine. With your support, we can get things off the ground.
